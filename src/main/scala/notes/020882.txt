Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Left cerebellar stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-2-13**]: Emergent Suboccipital decompressive craniotomy
[**2201-2-20**]: PEG


History of Present Illness:
 The patient is a 52 year-old male with a h/o HTN, diabetes
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] intubated with a diagnosis of
left cerebellar hemorrhage.  Per transfer report, he presented
to the emergency room per EMS after vomiting at home coffee
ground emesis with sudden onset severe occipital headache.
During
transport, he was noted to have SBPs in the 200s.  While in the
emergency room, he vomited coffee ground emesis and an NGT was
placed with return of 200cc of coffee ground emesis. He was
noted to have difficulty controlling his left arm, unable to do
LUE finger to nose with expressive aphasia and left sided facial
droop.  Following a CT scan of the head which demonstrated a
large cerebellar hemorrhage with mass effect on the 4th
ventricle, the patient became increasing dyspneic and agitated
and was intubated for blood pressure control and airway control.
Tox screen was negative.
In the emergency room on presentation, he had spontaneous
movement of his LUE and withdrawal to noxious stimuli of BLE
without movement of his RUE.  Gag reflex intact. He was
transfered to the ICU.

IMAGING:
-------------
NCHCT [**2-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Large space-occupying process in the left posterior
fossa with
mass effect on the fourth ventricle, perimesencephalic cisterns,
and possible mild left tonsillar herniation. Given the
heterogeneity of the lesion, subacute blood products are not
excluded, but no definite acute blood products are identified.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent subacute infarct, hemorrhage, underlying mass
lesion or infection is not excluded and an MRI is recommended
for further evaluation if there is no contraindication.

MRI HEAD [**2-13**](Post-op):
Area of restricted diffusion with blood products in the left
cerebellum with enhancement along the folia. The differential
diagnosis
includes a disease such as intravascular lymphoma vs. an acute
infarct. The enhancement along the brainstem and internal
auditory canal could be due to leptomeningeal disease or due to
blood products within the subarachnoid space. There is tonsillar
herniation seen due to mass effect from the fourth ventricular
swelling and compression of the cerebellum and hydrocephalus
identified. Correlation with CSF findings when the mass effect
has reduced would help for further assessment.

NCHCT [**2-13**](Post-op):
Expected post-surgical changes of left occipital craniectomy
with
residual blood products and air within the resection bed.
Persistent but mild improvement of effacement of fourth
ventricle and foramen magnum crowding. No new hemorrhage. No
midline shift.

Echo [**2201-2-14**]:
Normal global biventricular systolic function. No pulmonary
hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Limited study.

MRA Brain [**2201-2-17**]:
1. Mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease. No vascular
malformation or
aneurysm.
2. Asymmetric nonvisualization of the left AICA and superior
cerebellar
arteries and nonvisualization of the PICA bilaterally.

Video Swallow eval [**2201-2-18**]:
SWALLOWING VIDEO FLUOROSCOPY: Oropharyngeal swallowing video
fluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech and
swallow division. Multiple consistencies of barium were
administered. Barium passed freely through the oropharynx and
esophagus without evidence of obstruction. There was evidence of
penetration and gross aspiration with thin liquids and nectar.

IMPRESSION: Gross aspiration with thin liquids and nectar.

KUB [**2201-2-22**]:
FINDINGS:
Oral contrast is visualized in the large bowel, demonstrating
diverticulosis and a filled appendix. While there is a paucity
of air in the small bowel, I do not see dilated loops nor
abnormal air-fluid levels. The psoas margins are sharply
delineated. There is no evidence for pneumatosis or free air. A
PEG tube is seen, with the balloon component just to the left of
the L1 vertebral body pedicle.
  IMPRESSION: Nonspecific nonobstructed bowel gas pattern.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 449**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and was brought
emergently to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**]. He had a posterior
decompressive craniectomy. He returned to the SICU intubated and
post-op CT head was satisfactory. Off sedation he was following
commands with all 4 extremities, right grasp was weaker. He was
on a PPI drip for his coffee ground emesis per GI. His SBP goal
was <140 per Stroke Team. He was being weaned toward sedation in
the afternoon on [**2201-2-13**]. He was extubated on the [**2-14**], his
Protonix drip was transitioned to Po bid, neurologically he was
intact with a left facial and some serosanguinous drainage from
wound. He required frequent pulmonary toilet including deep
nasal suctioning which required him to remain in the ICU. SQH
was started on [**2-17**]. Neurology recommended an MRA and this was
ordered. The patient removed his NG tube twice. A Dobbhoff was
placed. He had tachycardia requiring IV Lopressor throughout the
day. His oral metoprolol was not able to be given during day due
to difficulty with Dobbhoff placement. The pm dose will be
given.

He continued to have some serous drainage at his incision. A
small leak was noted at the superior aspect of his incision and
2 staples were placed at the bedside in the pm of [**2201-2-17**]. He
removed his Dobhoff. He was getting prn
