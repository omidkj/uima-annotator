Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion
endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 72 y.o. Male w/ h.o. CAD s/p CABG [**2148**] w/ redo in
[**2163**] (has LIMA->LAD, SVG->LAD, SVG->OM in [**2148**], redo included
SVG-> PDA, SVG to prior LIMA), multiple stents (LMCA, D1 in
[**2160**]; PCI to SVG to LAD, ISR of D1 stent in [**2161**]; LMCA in [**2162**]),
DM II, HL who presents as a transfer from OSH w/ NSTEMI.

He reports a few days of myalgias and general weakness/fatigue.
Along with this, he reports the sudden onset of chest pain,
which he described a different from his angina.  He took 1 SL
NTG with some relief but, given the persistence of his symptoms,
he presented to [**Hospital3 **].  Upon review of the [**Hospital1 **]
records, ED EKG showed  2:1 a-flutter at a rate of 120 with
RBBB.  He had no chest pain in the ED there and no SOB, but he
did report to the ED physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sense of general malaise.  He
was also noted to have a fever of 101 in the ED.  He was given
Acetaminophen for the fever, a chest xray was obtained which was
reportedly non-diagnostic as was a U/A.  His labwork was notable
for a Troponin T of 2.9, BNP 1070. He was thus transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals were T97, HR 97, BP 105/68, RR 14, Sat
98% on 2L. His labwork was notable for a Troponin of 1.05,
BUN/Cr 41/1.7, plts 140, Hgb 10.8, INR 1.4, PTT 37.4.  He
continued to have right shoulder pain and was given Morphine 4mg
IV x 1. His blood pressure dropped to 87/56 after he received
the morphine so he received a 500cc bolus with good BP response.
 Portable CXR showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with no
effusions.

On arrival to the floor, patient was stable but reported
lightheadedness.  Orthostatics at that time were normal and
lightheadedness resolved.  He went to the bathroom and was then
found down, blue and pulseless with agonal breathing.  CPR was
initiated but patient regained consciousness quickly.  No
medications or shocks were administered.  Rhythm was sinus with
hemodynamics were stable.  SBP was 140, oxygen sats were in the
mid-90s, HR was 80-90s.  Given syncopal event with
unresponsiveness, he is being transferred to the CCU for further
monitoring.

On arrival to the CCU, patient's oxygen saturations were in the
mid-high 80s on a NRB.  He denied any shortness of breath or
chest pain.  ABG showed that he was oxygenating well
(7.39/38/314/24).  Sats improved to 98% on 2L at the time of
this note.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, ankle edema and syncope.  He denies paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations.

Studies:
CXR [**12-28**] FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
stable, with mild cardiomegaly. There is mild degree of
pulmonary edema. The lung volumes are low. No focal
consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
Evidence of prior CABG, including intact sternotomy wires and
mediastinal surgical clips are present.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. No definite consolidation
detected.

CT spine [**12-28**]: IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture.
Spondylotic abnormalities, and other findings, noted above. MRI
scanning is more sensitive than CT imaging in detecting cord
injury from spondylosis/trauma, if clinically suspected.

CT head [**12-28**]: CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.

Cervical spine MRI [**12-29**]:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. No evidence of ligamentous injury or disruption. Trace fluid
along the
anterior aspect of vertebral body of C5 through C7. No
fractures.
2. Moderate-to-severe canal stenosis between C3 and C6 (severe
at C5-C6) due to a combination of disc herniation and posterior
longitudinal ligament
thickening. Cord demonstrates associated myelomalacia, without
superimposed
acute abnormalities.
3. Multilevel neural foraminal narrowing, particularly on the
left.

Echo [**12-30**]:
Mild spontaneous e
