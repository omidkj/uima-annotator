History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old man with a history of plasma cell
leukemia/myeloma with IgG paraprotein complicated in the past by
DVT/PE, who is day 11 s/p DPACE. The patient presented to clinic
today with fever to 100.8 and a WBC count of 0.1 (ANC pending).
He was admitted for DPACE on [**2168-2-12**] due to rapid progression of
disease (markedly elevated IgG level) s/p Cytoxan on [**2-1**]. He
tolerated DPACE well, only experiencing some fatigue and water
retention, and was discharged to home with 10days of neupogen
injections. He experienced progressive fatigue upon discharge
home, however had no fevers or localizing signs at home. He has
had no appetite since discharge. He has a rash on his scalp and
face consistent with folliculitis which has been present since
discharge. Accompanying the above weakness, he has been
experiencing some associated shortness of breath. He was getting
dressed to come in to clinic and felt as though he could not
catch his breath. This was alleviated with rest. He has also
developed some oral lesions. He denied any nasal congestion,
sore throat, headache, chest pain, dysuria, hesitancy or urinary
frequency. He does report decreased bowel movements which he
attributes to decreased PO intake. He does report some mild
epigastric "pressure" which is relieved with belching.
.
He presented to clinic and on arrival noted a non-productive
cough and fever. He had no cough prior to this afternoon.
.
Review of systems: No chest pain, palpitations. No nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, or back pain. No numbness or
tingling of his extremities. No headaches, dizziness, blurred
vision. He denies any bleeding or increased bruising, hematuria,
hematochezia, epistaxis or gum bleeding. All other systems
reviewed in detail and negative except for what has been
mentioned above.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
1. Diagnosed on [**12/2164**] with plasma cell leukemia/myeloma when
he presented with sepsis.
2. Status post hyper-CVAD x2 cycles in [**1-/2165**] and 01/[**2165**].
3. Status post Cytoxan 750 mg/m2 for 2 days with Decadron pulses
followed by thalidomide at 200 mg daily in 2/[**2165**]. This
treatment was complicated by a left leg DVT for which he was
started on coumadin.
4. Status post autologous stem cell transplant in 05/[**2165**].
5. Noted for recurrent disease and treated on the
Revlimid/Velcade study, number 04-130 with excellent response to
treatment from [**7-/2166**] until [**1-/2167**], however discontinued on
protocol due to pulmonary embolism in 01/[**2167**].
6. Started maintenance Velcade in [**8-/2167**] with three and half
cycles of therapy given his first cycle was given without
Decadron, Decadron added for the subsequent cycles.
7. Initiated treatment with Revlimid alone on [**2167-12-16**] with
increasing doses for 21-day cycle with therapeutic Lovenox to
100 mg b.i.d. due to history of PE.
8. Given cytoxan therapy on [**2-1**], tolerated well.
9. Treated with DPACE on [**2171-2-12**], tolerated well.
.

2. Renal insufficiency
3. Hx of Zoster

Discharge Labs:

Reports:
[**2-23**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. As noted previously, the
3 mm nodule seen on CT is not evident on the radiographs.
.
[**2-24**] Skin biopsy:
Skin, right face  (A):
Skin with central dilated follicle and mild perifollicular
chronic inflammation.
Note:  No leukemic infiltrate is seen in the sections examined
and inflammation is minimal (there is a focal mild
perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate).  While there is a
central dilated follicle, no Demodex is seen within the
follicle. The findings are non-specific and clinical correlation
is needed. Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 54131**] is notified of the diagnosis on
[**2168-2-25**].
.
[**3-1**] ECHO: MPRESSION: Very small, mobile echodensity as
described above on the aortic valve annulus/sinus. The location
is very atypical for a vegetation and no aortic regurgitation is
seen.  Compared with the prior study of [**2168-2-12**], the findings are
similar (the mobile echodensity is less well defined, but
suggested on clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).  If clinically indicated, a TEE might be
better able to define the aortic annular echodensity.

[**3-27**] Abd MRI
1. Right lower lobe airspace disease, which may be infection or
atelectasis.
2. Evidence of hemosiderosis.
3. L3 compression fracture deformity appears chronic.
4. Gallbladder wall thickening.
5. No abnormal lesions within the liver or spleen, however,
evaluation for hepatosplenic candidiasis is limited due to the
lack of post-contrast imaging. If clinically warranted, patient
should return for post-contrast images.

[**4-2**] CXR
1. Support lines in place.
2. Right basilar atelectasis and small left-sided pleural
effusion.

ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function
appears
depressed. There is probably inferior hypokinesis but views are
technically  suboptimal. LV ejection fraction difficult to
estimated (?45%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**],
left ventricular  function now appears similar in suboptimal
views. Heart rate is now slightly lower.

CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Rapidly enlarging right hilar mass, obstructing the right
middle lobe bronchi and markedly narrowing bronchus intermedius
and right lower lobe bronchi. Findings are most consistent with
a neopl
