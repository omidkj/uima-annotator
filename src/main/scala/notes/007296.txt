Pertinent Results:
OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY ([**8-14**]):
Gallbladder, open cholecystectomy:
     - Chronic cholecystitis.
     - Cystic lymph node with reactive, florid follicular
hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis.

DRAIN STUDY AND REMOVAL OF DRAIN ([**8-20**]):
- Patent choledochoduodenostomy tract with free flow from the
upper common bile duct into the duodenum.  The ampulla appears
to be fully obstructed.  There was no appreciable flow along
this anatomic pathway, though this is likely just higher
resistance than the bypass.  No intrahepatic strictures
identified.  Left-sided ducts were not filled during this
examination.
- Uncomplicated removal of indwelling biliary drain.  Patient
may continue to have some leaking into the bandage.  Please
change the dressing p.r.n. with a pressure-type dressing.  The
tract should close completely in several days.

RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**8-24**]):
1.  Diffuse pneumobilia, unchanged from prior.  No significant
biliary ductal dilatation.
2.  No definite fluid collection within the region of the porta
hepatis.
Examination is limited due to overlying bowel gas.  If high
clinical
suspicion, consider CT for further assessment.
3.  Unchanged splenomegaly.
4.  Mild abdominal ascites.

BILATERAL LE ULTRASOUND ([**8-24**]): No lower extremity DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment.  On [**2194-8-14**], the patient underwent
the following procedure:
1. Extensive lysis of adhesions.
2. Open cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration.
3. Partial wedge hepatectomy.
4. Choledochoduodenostomy biliary bypass.

This procedure went well without complication (reader referred
to the Operative Note for details). After her operation, the
patient was admitted to the ICU NPO, on IV fluids, on a 1-day
course of antibiotics, with a foley catheter, JP drain, PTBD,
and NGT in place.  She remained intubated, on a ventillator, and
was hemodynamically stable.

On POD#1, the patient was successfully extubated, and placed on
a ketamine drip for pain control. Later that day, the ketamine
drip was discontinued, and an epidural was placed for pain
control. For a short period (approximately 1 hour) after placing
the epidural, the patient required a small dose of pressor
support to maintain her blood pressures. Thereafter, she no
longer required this, and tolerated the epidural well. Her
drains were maintained. She remained NPO, with all her drains
and tubes still in place.

On POD#2, the patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC. Her
epidural and drains/tubes were maintained. She was out of bed to
chair.

On POD#3, she was well enough to be transferred out of the ICU,
and onto the general surgical floor. She remained NPO, with JP,
PTBD, NGT and foley in place, as well as the epidural continued
for pain control.

On POD#5, her NGT was clamped, and epidural and all other drains
were maintained. On this day, due to some concern about erythema
around her incision, she was stared on IV cefazolin. Her
epidural was removed, and she was transitioned to a PCA for pain
control, which she tolerated well. Her foley was removed and she
urinated independently. Later in the day, her NGT was removed,
and she was permitted to have clear liquids, which she tolerated
very well.

On POD#6, her PTBD had a drain study performed on it, and upon
satisfactory results (reader referred to "Pertinent Results")
the drain was removed. Additionally, her JP drain was
discontinued. Due to some concern for nausea, she was made NPO.
However, upon feeling much better in the evening, she was put
back on clear liquids, and then a regular diet. She tolerated
this very well.

On POD#7, due to a marked improvement in the appearance of her
incision, her IV cefazolin was discontinued. Her epidural was
removed, and she was transitioned to oral pain medications,
which she tolerated well. She was seen by Physical Therapy, and
ambulated mutiple times per day.

She continued to progress well. On POD#9, she was noted to spike
a fever to 102.4, upon which a fever workup was initiated, and
all results were negative for any infectious process. A second
fever on POD#10 prompted ultrasounds of the LEs and RUQ, both of
which were unconcerning as well. Thereafter, the patient had no
more fevers. She continued to feel well, with good pain control,
ambulating multiple times per day, and tolerating regular diet.
Her staples were removed on POD#10 and steri strips were placed.


The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout hospitalization. Electrolytes were routinely
followed, and repleted when necessary. The patient's white blood
count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of
infection. Wound care was performed regularly and thoroughly.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay;
insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. The patient received
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this
stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was we
