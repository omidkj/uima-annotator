Service:

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Constrictive pericarditis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Constrictive pericardial thickening.
2.  Pulmonary embolus.
3.  Status post pericardectomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old
woman with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed
approximately twenty-five years ago and treated with
chemotherapy/radiation.  The patient has also had a pulmonary
embolism approximately fifteen years ago.  She was admitted
to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center on [**2141-1-18**], for increased
shortness of breath, chest tightness, nonproductive cough
associated with tachycardia.  Deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary embolus workup was negative.  Spiral chest CT did,
however, reveal a thickened pericardium with pericardial
effusion.  Follow-up echocardiogram confirmed a markedly
thickened pericardium, moderate effusion with right atrial
collapse, septal dyskinesis.  There were marked respiratory
variations of mitral valve flow.  The patient further
underwent cardiac catheterization demonstrating an ejection
fraction of greater than 65% and no evidence of any coronary
artery disease.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for pericardectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's lymphoma.
2.  Status post chemotherapy/radiation.
3.  History of pulmonary embolus.
4.  Hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cholecystectomy, [**2111**].
2.  Splenectomy, [**2107**].
3.  Broken leg, [**2130**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Synthroid 75 mcg once daily.
2.  Solu-Cortef 100 mg q6hours.
3.  Indomethacin 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Lorazepam 0.5 mg three times a day.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Zosyn.
7.  Zithromax.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is a middle age woman in
no acute distress.  Vital signs reveal a temperature 97.1
degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 107, blood pressure 151/64,
oxygen saturation 99% on four liters of oxygen, 107.2
kilograms.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat is atraumatic,
normocephalic.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Anicteric.  The throat is clear.  The neck is supple without
masses or lymphadenopathy.  No bruit or jugular venous
distention.  Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination is regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended without masses or organomegaly.  Extremities are
warm, noncyanotic, nonedematous times four. Neurologic
examination is grossly intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was transferred on [**2141-1-24**], to
[**Hospital1 69**] for pericardectomy.  The
patient was taken to the operating room on [**2141-1-25**], and had
pericardectomy.  It was noted by anesthesia on intraoperative
transesophageal echocardiogram that there was a fresh
clot/thrombus seen in the left main pulmonary artery.  The
patient otherwise tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU for closer monitoring.  On the
evening of postoperative day number zero, the patient was put
on a Heparin drip for anticoagulation of her pulmonary
embolus.  The patient otherwise did well and was extubated on
postoperative day number zero.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was transferred
to the SICU due to the need for bed availability.  The
patient was stable overnight and oxygen was weaned as
tolerated.  The patient continued to do well though she was
in sinus tachycardia and was transferred to the floor later
on postoperative day number two.  Her anticoagulation was
continued and the patient was begun on oral Coumadin therapy.
Diuresis was also pushed with oral Lasix.  The rest of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course was unremarkable and the patient
remained in persistent sinus tachycardia, likely thought due
to the existing pulmonary embolus.

Ultimately, the patient was discharged on postoperative day
number eight tolerating regular diet and adequate pain
control with p.o. pain medications.  At the time, she was
cleared by physical therapy.  The patient's INR at discharge
was 1.9.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DIET:  Ad lib.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily.
2.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day times seven days.
3.  Potassium Chloride 20 meq twice a day times seven days.
4.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets q4hours p.r.n.
5.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
6.  Coumadin 5 mg once daily.
7.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Ativan 0.5 to 1.0 mg q6hours p.r.n.

INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to have close follow-up with
her primary care physician for INR checks.  Goal INR should
be between 2.0 and 3.0.  The patient should follow-up with
Cardiology within one to two weeks time and address the need
for diuresis as well as adjustment of cardiac medications at
that time.  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
four weeks time.
