DISCHARGE EXAM:
Patient easily arousable, Generally agitated and confused,
mumbles words. Pupils 7 to 5 mm bilaterally. Left facial droop.
[**Location (un) 2848**] J collar at all times. Ambulating with good strenght, but
requires assist.

Pertinent Results:
[**5-30**] Head CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above with
shift of
normally midline structures leftward. There is mild medial
displacement of
the uncus without frank herniation.
2. Complex left convexity, skull base, and sphenoid bone
fracture extending across the left carotid canal with associated
narrowing of the lumen of the left internal carotid artery as
described above, suggestive of vessel injury.  Note that the
fracture line also extends across the jugular foramen, without
evidence of thrombosis, and into the middle ear cavity with
disruption of the ossicular chain. No active contrast
extravasation.
3. No evidence of vascular injury within the neck.
4. Multiple left-sided rib fractures, left clavicular fracture,
left-sided
pneumothorax and left pulmonary contusion, all better assessed
on prior CT
torso.

[**5-30**] Head CT :IMPRESSION: Unchanged right hemispheric subdural
hematoma and associated small subarachnoid hemorrhage and right
frontal contusion with associated edema. Unchanged leftward
subfalcine herniation by 5.7 mm and mild left medial uncal
displacement without frank uncal herniation.

[**5-30**] CXR: WNL
[**5-31**] CXR: Compared with [**2193-5-30**], the ET tube and NG tube have been
removed. There is a faint opacity at the right lower lobe, which
could represent aspiration or developing pneumonia. There is
also a very faint patchy opacity in the left suprahilar region,
which could represent a resolving aspiration, pneumonic
infiltrate, or contusion, slightly improved compared with
[**2193-5-30**]. No effusion or pneumothorax detected. Left clavicular
fracture again noted.

[**5-31**] Head CT: Overall, no significant change in the distribution
of hemorrhage. Slightly decreased displacement of the uncus is
identified. The mass effect on the right lateral ventricle is
unchanged. Previously noted facial and skull base fractures are
seen, and are unchanged with blood within the sphenoid sinus

[**6-2**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**5-31**], the area of
increased opacification at the right base has decreased,
suggesting some resolution of an aspiration. A vague area of
increased opacification is seen in the left perihilar region,
which also could represent a focus of aspiration. No definite
vascular congestion or pleural effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
23M s/p motorcycle collision without helmet.  As per witness, pt
was traveling approx 50mph.  EMS found pt down and unresponsive,
but mumbling, combative and MAE. He continues to be intubated
and sedated. Does not open eyes or follow commands and moves all
extremities will good strength off sedation.  Pupils are equal
and reactive to light from 5 to 3mm.  He has marked periorbital
swelling and ecchymosis.
On [**5-31**] The patient was extubated. A CXR was obtained which
revealed a left lobe opacity which was concerning for presumed
VAP. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime.

On [**6-1**], patient was transferred to floor with a sitter for
aggitation. On [**6-2**], patient appeared less aggitated and exam
slowly improving. A follow up CXR was done which revealed
improvement of the previously seen opacity. On [**6-3**] Patient cont
to improve slightly. He is opening his eyes spont and
intermittently attending the examiner. He is not following
commands but is trying to mumble words and is MAE's
spontaneously with good strengths. Infectious Disease
recommended stopping all antibiotics due to the stable
respiratory status and absence of sign of infection.

On [**6-4**] speech/language consultation as well as PT/OT
consultations were requested. He cont to require restraints for
pulling at lines/picking skin. Multiple evaluations by Speech
therapy on different days revealed that patient was not
cognitively alert enought to take an adequate oral diet. General
surgery was consulted for a PEG, and a PEG was placed in the OR
on [**2193-6-7**].

Ent was consulted to evaluate the patients more prominant and
noticeable left facial droop. There recommendations were a
course of steroids, ear drops, an audiogram when patient
congnitavely improved follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic in [**1-31**] weeks after
discharge.

On [**6-12**] some drainage was noted around the PEG site that was
questionable for an infection, although there was no erythema
noted. General surgery was called to evaluate the site. The
drainage  and the wound did not look concerning to them for an
infection.
