Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-1-19**] Mitral valve repair with posterior leaflet
(P2)triangular resection with a ring annuloplasty using a 34-mm
[**Company 1543**] Profile 3-D annuloplasty ring, Full left and
right-sided concomitant maze procedure with resection of the
left atrial appendage using the
[**Company 1543**] Gemini X bipolar system and the Excel monopolar pen.
Reconstruction of the pericardium using a core matrix
product.


History of Present Illness:
53 year old male with significant medical history of mitral
valve prolapse and severe mitral valve regurgitation. Also
recently found to be in atrial fibrillation for which he has
been started on Coumadin. The patient does
describe shortness of breath with strenuous activity, however,
has attributed this to deconditioning. Cardiac catheterization
revealed normal coronaries. [**2102-11-9**] routine ECHO was done to
evaluate murmur. Results revealed a markedly dilated LA, a
moderately dilated LV cavity with overall normal LV systolic
function, an LVEF of 70%, 1+AR,  mildly thickened mitral valve
leaflets,  mild
to moderate posterior mitral leaflet prolapse, 3+ MR restrictive
filling abnormality with elevated left atrial pressure and
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
[**2103-1-19**] at 9:55:56 AM      FINAL

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus
in the LAA. All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the
left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A
catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the
RV. No spontaneous echo contrast in the RAA. No thrombus in the
RAA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail. No mass or
vegetation on mitral valve. Mild mitral annular calcification.
Torn mitral chordae. No MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to
the eccentric MR jet, its severity may be underestimated (Coanda
effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is seen
in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. LVEF =
65%, although this may be an overestimate in the setting of
moderately severe MR.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. There is partial mitral leaflet flail of P2 and some of P1.
3-D images were obtained. The annulus size was normal. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Torn mitral chordae
are present. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen with an anteriorly-directed jet.. Due to the eccentric
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A pacing for slow sinus.
Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. No MR.
Minimal MS with 3 mmHg mean gradient and MVA = 3.0 cm2.
Preserved biventricular systolic function with LVEF now 50%.
Trace AI. The LAA is no longer visible after Maze procedure. The
aortic contour is normal post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and underwent mitral valve repair,
MAZE, and left atrial appendage ligation.  See operative report
for further details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative
antibiotics.  He was transferred to the CVICU for post operative
management.  He was weaned sedation, awoke neurologically
intact, and extubated without complications in the first twenty
four hours.  He was started on epinephrine for decreased cardiac
function, he improved and was able to wean off post operative
day one.  He was started on amiodarone due MAZE procedure and
coumadin was restarted, in which he did have episodes of atrial
fibrillation post operatively.  He remained in the intensive
care unit awaiting floor bed, was transfered on post operative
day three.  Physical therapy worked with him on strength and
mobility.  He was started on ativan for anxiety after finding
out mother passed away and social work was consulted.  He
continued to progress and was ready for discharge home with
services on post operative day 4 in sinus rhythm.
