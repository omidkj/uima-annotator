Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Wound infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right below the knee amputation ([**2149-9-8**])

History of Present Illness:
57 M w/ diabetes, morbid obesity, with interstitial pulmonary
fibrosis on steroids who recently was treated for MRSA
osteomyelitis of the right ankle but then had his antibiotics
stopped 3 weeks ago because of renal problems returns with pain,
redness, swelling and open ulceration of R ankle. One week ago
he fell, sustaining an injury to his r ankle and right shoulder.
The ankle began to swell in the last few days become
erythematous and a new wound developed over the side of his
osteomyelitis of the ankle, draining cloudy yellow pus. The
shoulder, which had not been assessed by a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] been
very painful with decreased range of motion since the fall. Pt
had R ankle surgery in [**Month (only) 216**] for a fracture sustained from
falling, which became infected one month later, requiring
surgery to remove devices. Wound infection was identified as
MRSA, and PT was diagnosed with osteomyelitis later in the year.
Pt has dyspnea at baseline from his IPF, but states that he
feels well-controlled of late. He has a home O2 requirement of
2L at baseline.
.
In the ED, the patient was admitted for what appears to be
cellulitis and osteomyelitis of his right ankle. Per ED, he has
no sign of necrotizing fascitis. He was seen by ortho who will
follow closely. He received IV vancomycin (1g) for the infection
and stress dose steroids (200mg hydrocortisone), as well as
morphine and percocet for pain.

[**2149-9-8**] Pathology from RIGHT BELOW THE KNEE AMPUTATION
Right below knee amputation:
A)  Gangrene.
B)  Acute osteomyelitis.
C)  Marked atherosclerosis.
D)  Margins appear viable.

TEE (Complete) Done [**2149-9-8**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the study.

MR CALF W&W/O CONTRAST RIGHT  [**2149-9-7**]
1. Interval progression of osteomyelitis involving the distal
tibia, fibula,
talus, and calcaneus with probable septic arthritis involving
the posterior
and middle subtalar joints, the tibiotalar joint, and the
tibiofibular
syndesmosis.
2. Improving anterior tibial subperiosteal abscess.
3. Improvement of post-traumatic and post-surgical changes of
the distal
tibia.
4. Interval improvement in subcutaneous edema and fluid
collections, in
keeping with improving cellulitis. Skin thickening, however, is
worse.
5. Persistent myositis.
6. Longitudinal split tears of the distal posterior tibialis
tendon, peroneus
brevis, peroneus longus.
7. Tenosynovitis of posterior tibial tendon, flexor digitorum
longus, and
flexor hallucis longus tendons.
8. Achilles tendinosis.
9. No drainable collection.
10. Possible partial tear of the plantar fascia.
11. Multiple ligamentous tears, not well assessed on this
examination.

ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U RIGHT [**2149-9-5**]
Normal arterial waveforms throughout the right lower extremity
except for dorsalis pedis artery, which demonstrates monophasic
flow with low peak systolic velocity as specified above.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 M w/ diabetes, morbid obesity, with interstitial pulmonary
fibrosis on steroids who recently was treated for MRSA
osteomyelitis of the right ankle but then had his antibiotics
stopped 3 weeks ago because of renal problems who was admitted
for reucrrent MRSA osteomyelitis of right ankle, complicated
with MRSA bacteremia.

Ankle osteomyelitis:
Likely was acute on chronic from previous treated osteomyelitis,
unclear whether recent fall was a contributing factor. Pt
received IV abx with vancomycin. He was evaluated by ortho and
had right lower extremity amputation. As per ID, the patient is
to receive antibiotic therapy with vancomycin for 4 weeks
following his amputation, which was on [**2149-9-8**].

Hypoxemia/hypercarbia:
Pt had acute respiratory event on the night of surgery ([**2149-9-8**]).
He returned from surgery without
