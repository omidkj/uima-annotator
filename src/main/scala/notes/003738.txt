History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66-year-old patient with biopsy-
proven carcinoma of the mid-esophagus from about 25 cm to 29
cm from the incisors. He completed induction
chemoradiotherapy under the care of his physicians at
[**Location (un) 5164**] and was seen after completing this
with evidence for a partial response radiographically. A
transthoracic resection of the mid-esophagus and lymphadenectomy
is planned.

Pertinent Results:
[**2186-12-5**]: barium swallow: Conray was used in this study. Contrast
passes promptly through the anastomosis into the distal stomach.
A thin stream of contrast is seen extravasating from the
anastomotic site and tracking to the right of the neoesophagus
and collecting slightly more distally. This collection did not
drain during the course of this study.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with a small contained leak at
the site of the cervical anastamosis, as described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and taken to the OR for Transthoracic
esophagectomy. Apical bullectomy.  Left cervical
esophagogastrostomy.  Feeding jejunostomy.
OR course uncomplicated. Had epidural, right chest tube to sxn,
cervical JP to bulb abd feeding j-tube to gravity. Remained
intubated post op and admitted to the CSRU for ventilatory
support. Pt was extubated on POD#1. Post op course was
complicated by tacycardia, readmission to the ICU for pulmonary
hygiene on POD#6 and POD#9 for leukocytosis and persistant
cervical anastomtic leak with bilious drainage from chest tube
and JP drain, left pleural effusion which was tapped under
ultrasound for 1100cc, and post op anemia for which he was
transfused. Escalating doses of beta blockade to maintain HR
control. Maintained on triple abx for emperic coverage which
were d/c'd 24hrs prior to d/c after negative culture data. Chest
tube and JP drain were d/c'd once they were no longer draining
bilious fluid.
NPO status maintained d/t anastomotic leak which was still
evident per barium swallow done just prior to d/c. Trophic tube
feeds started via J-tube and titrated to goal once bowel
function returned. Pain was well controlled on roxicet elixir
via J-tube.
Pt will return in one week for a repeat barium swallow and
follow up w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
