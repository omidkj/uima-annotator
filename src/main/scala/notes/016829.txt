Chief Complaint:
retroperitoneal liposarcoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2178-10-9**]: retroperitoneal exploration for recurrent high grade
liposarcoma

[**2178-10-20**]: paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
41 year old male with a history of left retropertioneal sarcoma
s/p resection in [**2177-10-2**], insulin - dependent diabetes
who now presents s/p resection of recurrence of his sarcoma. He
initially presented in [**2177-9-1**] wo an OSH with fevers,
leukocytosis, and anemia with a CT scan showing a large psoas
lesion extending into the left kidney. The lesion was resected
one year ago with acute blood loss anemia as the major
complication post op. He was supposed to undergo subsequent
radiation therapy, however, he was lost to follow up because of
an incaceration until he represented in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year to Dr. [**Name (NI) 19165**] clinic. It had become evident that the sarcoma recurred,
thus he went to the OR earlier today for resection. On [**10-9**], he
had resection of the sarcoma, along with psoas resection and a
left nephrectomy. EBL was 5 L. He was transfused a total 6 units
PRBCs, 500cc 5% albumin, and 10 L fluid over the 7 hour surgery.
Hct increased from 31 to 40 post op and pt was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Pt was transferred to the floor on [**10-11**] and underwent
paracentesis on [**10-20**] that returned 4+ PMNs, no microorganisms
identified. JP drain remained in place until discharge with
small amount of chylous fluid collected.

Imaging:
CXR [**2178-10-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**10-5**], there is now an
endotracheal tube in place with its tip about 3.6 cm above the
carina.  Nasogastric tube appears to extend to the upper
stomach, though the side port cannot be definitely identified as
being below the esophagogastric junction.  Very low lung volumes
may account for some of the prominence of the transverse
diameter of the heart.  No definite vascular congestion.
Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Mild
atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.

CXR [**2178-10-10**]: No previous images.  Left subclavian pacer has been
placed, with the leads in the general area of the apex of the
right ventricle and the right atrium.  Cardiac silhouette is
within normal limits without definite vascular congestion or
pleural effusion.  No evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax.
There is evidence of coronary artery calcification as well as
previous CABG procedure with intact midline sternal wires.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo M with history of highly undifferentiated retroperitoneal
sarcoma s/p resection in [**2177**], now with recurrence of tumor s/p
resection and left nephrectomy, complicated by an EBL of roughly
5 Liters who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and stabilized and sent to
the surgical floor. While on the floor, pt developed abdominal
distension and approximately 3L fluid was drained through
paracentesis. JP drain was then inserted, which produced milky
fluid likely to be chyle. Pt discharged on low-fat diet.

# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had significant EBL during
his surgery.  He was transfused 6u of blood and 2 of FFP.  He
was originally requiring pressors and these were weaned down. He
was monitored in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and when he was no longer bleeding was
transferred to the floor. At the time of transfer his HCT was
stable x24 hours. Patient remained HDS on floor with no further
blood loss.

# RP Sarcoma: Now s/p resection and left nephrectomy. Per
surgery. Patient on ancef for post op prohylacis x 3 doses.
Patient will follow up with surgery and rad onc recs on
discharge.

# Pain and epidural catheter: Epidural catheter in, pain
following and recommended adjusting the rate rather than adding
on a pca. Hispain was well controlled at the time of transfer to
the floor. Pain managed with IV pain meds on floor and
transitioned to PO pain meds at time of discharge

# Respiratory failure: Intubated for procedure and remained
intubated overnight on HD!1, he was extubated without problem
and with increased IS and getting OOB his ABG improved and his
respiratory acidosis improved. Saturating >94% on room air at
time of discharge

# Diabetes: Patient's insulin regimen unknown, currently on a
sliding scale.  Blood sugars were regularly checked and within
normal limits throuhgout stay on floor.
