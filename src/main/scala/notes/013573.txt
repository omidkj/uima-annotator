Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, shortness of
breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 62 y/o M with HTN who presents to ED with complaints of
chest pain.  Pt was riding the T to a ballgame today when he had
a sudden urge to have a bowel movement.  Pt went to a restroom
and was able to have a bowel movement, but then
developed severe knife-like chest pain which radiated to his
back.  Pt also felt lightheaded, dizzy, nauseous, and short of
breath.  No abd pain, diarrhea, or bright red blood per rectum.

Pertinent Results:
[**2141-6-18**] CXR: Prominence of the ascending aorta. Recommend
comparison with
cross-sectional imaging for evaluation of an aneurysm.

[**2141-6-18**] CTA torso:
1. Type B aortic dissection with evidence of end-organ vascular
compromise of the right kidney.
2. Aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta, infrarenal
abdominal aorta, and right common iliac artery as above.
3. Fluid in the scrotum bilaterally, consistent with possible
hydrocele.
Recommend comparison to clinical examination.

[**2141-6-20**] CXR: New consolidation at both lung bases, and new small
bilateral pleural effusions are concerning for aspiration. Heart
size top normal. No
pneumothorax or evidence of central adenopathy.

[**2141-6-20**] Renal ultrasound:
1. No normal arterial waveforms seen in the right kidney or
right main renal artery. This is concordant with findings of
decreased end organ perfusion secondary to dissection seen on CT
dated [**2141-6-18**].
2. Normal arterial waveforms in the left main renal artery and
kidney,
although full evaluation was technically limited as above.
3. No hydronephrosis or renal stones identified.

[**2141-6-21**] Echo (TTE): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is
moderately dilated. The abdominal aorta is moderately dilated. A
mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with
an intimal flap/aortic dissection. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2141-6-21**] CXR: New bilateral mid zone mainly peripheral patchy
airspace change, most suggestive of pneumonia. Atypical
pulmonary edema, ARDS or pulmonary hemorrhage while considered
would be less likely. Given the rapid onset, aspiration must be
considered.

[**2141-6-22**] Carotid series: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA
stenosis <40
No evidence of carotid dissection.

[**2141-6-22**] Head CT: No acute intracranial process. Left maxillary
sinus mucosal disease.

[**2141-6-24**] Renal ultrasound:
1. No left renal hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis or renal mass.
2. Normal arterial and venous flow to the left kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is 62 y/o M with htn who presents to ED with complaints of
chest pain.  Pt was riding the T to a ballgame today when he had
a sudden urge to have a bowel movement.  Pt went to a restroom
and was able to have a bowel movement, but then
developed severe knife-like chest pain which radiated to his
back.  Pt also felt lightheaded, dizzy, nauseous, and short of
breath.  No abd pain, diarrhea, or bright red blood per rectum.
Came to ER. Vascular and Cardiac Surgery consulted.

[**6-17**] - [**6-19**], CTA torso: type B aortic dissection, true lumen in
upper abd near completely occluded, false lumen supplies celiac,
SMA, L renal, R kidney asymmetrically hypoperfused.

Pt [**Hospital 13434**] transfered to the CVICU for [**Last Name (un) **] BP control.
Initally started on IV Nipride and IV Labetolol to keep SBP less
then 140. Pt r/o for MI.

Pain control.

[**6-20**], Pt creatinine elevated. Because of this and original read
of CTA. Renal US R>L perfusion. nl size.
Labetolol/Nicardipine(IV), Norvasc PO added for BP control.

Pain control.

Renal Consulted for move of creatinine from 1.4 to 2.1, thought
to be due to decreased perfusion to Kidney, coupled with ATN
from contrast load. No need for HD at this time. Pt making good
urine.

[**6-21**] - [**6-23**], Pt feeling SOB, decrease sats to 80's recieved Neb
treatment. It was noticed the patient had a WBC of 23. Pt also
febrile. Pt pan cx'd. Likely culprit thought to be PNA or CHF by
CXR. Pt put on BIPAP. Could not tolerate, dropped O2 sats again.
Pt Intubated 2'resp.failure/P edema.

To note patient hallucinating and confused. Lookes like patient
was posturing. Head CT negative for sroke.
