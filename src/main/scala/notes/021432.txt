Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion with pulsus paradoxus of 20

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]-guided pericardial fluid drainage
Thoracentesis (twice)
Placement of pleurex catheter ro right pleural space


History of Present Illness:
79yo M with PMHx significant for aortic stenosis s/p AVR
(tissue) [**2155-2-17**], COPD, prostate CA (s/p radiation and hormonal
therapy [**2150**])who presented from clinic with pericardial effusion
found to have pulsus of 20mmHg.
.
Patient was recently re-admitted for further evaluation of
hypotension from his rehab facility. During this recent
hospitalization, he received IV fluids.  Medications were
adjusted, namely lisinopril was discontinued and beta blocker
increased for
better rate control. An ECHO done during that admission ([**3-3**])
showed a moderate amount of pericardial fluid, mostly overlying
the left ventricle and comparatively little fluid over the right
ventricular free wall. There was abnormal septal motion which
could be due to a conduction abnormality, post-operative state
or increased inter ventricular dependence, and an accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral inflows but no other evidence of
tamponade physiology. He went to see his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]
in clinic today, who repeated echocardiogram and checked a
pulsus, which was high at 20mmHg. Per report, the effusion is
larger, though it is loculated and will likely require
echo-guided pericardiocentesis.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient endorses no CP/SOB. He says he
has had minimal swelling in the lower extremities. He notes some
intermittent nausea and poor PO intake over the last week or so.
He denies fevers/chills. Has no other complaints.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
-[**Location (un) **] ([**2155-3-10**]):
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is unusually small. with normal free wall contractility.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a moderate to large sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential,
although it is primarily posterolateral during imaging with the
patient in left lateral decubitus position. There is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular filling.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2155-3-3**], the effusion may be slightly larger.

-[**Year (4 digits) **] ([**2155-3-11**], post-drainage):
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2155-3-10**], the pericardial effusion has been completely
drained.

CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The thoracic aorta is normal
in caliber without dissection. Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic
calcifications are seen throughout its course. The pulmonary
arterial vasculature is well visualized to the subsegmental
level without filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is a loculated right pleural effusion, which is
predominantly nonhemorrhagic, but a portion of the medial right
basilar effusion measures 25-29 [**Doctor Last Name **], compatible with a slightly
complex effusion. There is minimal thickening and slight
enhancement of the visceral and parietal pleura at the very
right lung base, which can be seen in complex effusions,
including empyema. A small left pleural effusion is
nonhemorrhagic. Adjacent relaxation atelectasis is seen
bilaterally. No worrisome nodule or mass is seen. There is upper
lobe predominant moderate centrilobular emphysema. Peribronchial
wall thickening, predominantly in the right lower lobe with
endoluminal narrowing, may be due to acute bronchitis.
Secretions are seen in the trachea.
A right hilar lymph node conglomerate at the level of the
bifurcation of the bronchus intermedius measures 7 x 22 mm
(5:55), which may be reactive due to the right complex effusion
but followup is recommended. There is no left hilar, mediastinal
or axillary lymphadenopathy.
The heart is mildly enlarged with a small pericardial effusion
and pericardial enhancement. The patient is status post aortic
valve replacement. Mild coronary artery calcifications are seen.
No nodules are seen in the thyroid gland.
The study is not tailored for sub
