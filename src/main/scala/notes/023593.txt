History of Present Illness:
51 year old male who initially presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]with
3 days of dizziness, malaise, and fever/chills.  The patient
states that symptoms began with sudden onset one day following
initiation of a new welding job.  The patient states that he
replaced a coworker who became suddenly ill (requiring
hospitalization) on the same job site the day prior to starting
work.  He denies known toxic exposures, drug use, or other sick
contacts.  On admission to the OSH, the patient was found to be
hypoxic, tachycardic to 160s, febrile to 105.2.  Blood pressure
was stable.  The patient received 4L NS for tachycardia.
Admission EKG consistent with aflutter.  Labs [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], CXR
demonstrating LLL PNA.  The patient underwent head CT that was
negative for acute process.  He underwent LP that was reportedly
normal.  CT abdomen was remarkable for a mild ileus, distended
bladder, and LLL PNA.  The patient was started on
vanco/CTX/doxy/amp/levofloxacin for broad antimicrobial
coverage.  He was started on cardizem drip and heparin drip for
new onset Aflutter.  During the patient's 1d hospital course, he
had continued fevers to 104-105 on standing tylenol and cooling
blanket.  His Cr trended down to 1.8 from 2.4 with improving
UOP.  However, his hypoxia worsened, requiring escalation from
2L NC to nonrebreather following ABG of 7.4/20/52.  The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
His most recent vital signs prior to transfer were 133/59 130 26
98%NRB.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], initial vital signs 42 133 139/86 33 99%.
Patient continues to have dyspnea at rest.  He complains of
fever, chills, diaphoresis.  He also describes a recent history
of diarrhea.  He denies pain.

On review of systems, patient denies recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough or
wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure. Denies nausea,
vomiting, constipation, or abdominal pain. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies rashes or skin changes.

Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2184-8-9**]): PRESUMPTIVE
POSITIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN. (Reference
Range-Negative).  Performed by Immunochromogenic assay. Clinical
correlation and additional testing suggested including culture
and detection of serum antibody.

CXR [**2184-8-8**]: Volume of moderate left pleural effusion and
severity of left lower lobe consolidation have increased
slightly since [**8-10**], but the difference could be due to
transient findings such as retained secretions and a sympathetic
pleural exudate. Nevertheless careful followup is recommended,
to confirm treatment response and the absence of clinically
significant bronchial occlusion. Right lung is clear. Heart size
is normal. Tip of the right PIC line is in the mid to low SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 year old male who initially presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]with
3 days of dizziness, malaise, and fever/chills, found to have
legionella pneumonia and atrial flutter with RVR.  He was
admitted to the MICU and then transferred to the floor.

Active Issues:

#. Legionella Pneumonia:  He was admitted with hypoxia and
required non-rebreather initially.  He had a dramatic LLL
consolidation with A-A gradient on admission >400.  He was
started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin to cover
for CAP.  His urine legionella antigen was positive and he was
narrowed to levofloxacin.  His oxygenation slowly improved and
he was called out of the MICU. On the floor, his pulmonary
symptoms improved and he did not have an oxygen requirement at
discharge.

#. Fever: Patient admitted with persistent fevers >105.  In the
OSH, he had marked leukocytosis with bandemia.  He was treated
with standing acetaminophen and cooling blankets.  He was
treated for infection as above and his fevers were presumably
due to legionella.  Serum and urine tox were negative.  He
continued to have persistent fevers for ~3 days after he
demonstrated significant clinical improvement.  His fevers were
presumed to be secondary to Legionella, however, he was also
started on doxycycline for 10 days for possible concomitant
anaplasma infection.

#. [**Last Name (un) **]/CKD: Patient was admitted to OSH with creatinine of 2.4
that improved with IVF.  [**Last Name (un) **] was likely prerenal secondary to
fluid losses in setting of acute illness.  His Cr stabilized to
1.7 prior to discharge and his kidney disease was thought to be
secondary to underlying untreated hypertension.

#. Atrial flutter: He presented with atrial flutter with
variable block and tachycardia to 160s in setting of fever.  He
was initially treated with a diltizem drip and then weaned to
oral nodal blockade.  He was also anticoagulated with a heparin
drip.  He spontaneously reverted back into sinus rhythm.
However, given the unknown duration of his atrial tachycardia,
he was started on anti-coagulation that he will continue for a
month.

#. UTI:  The patient was admitted with a UA that could be
consistent with UTI but UCx at OSH was negative.  He was treated
with levaquin as above for pneumonia.

#. Mild transaminitis:  Patient admitted with mildly elevated
LFTS, likely due to legionella. Over the course of his
hospitalization, his LFTs normalized.

#. Hematuria: During the hospitalization, the patient developed
gross hematuria that was likely secondary to foley trauma in the
setting of anticoagulation.  However, after the heparin was
discontinued his hematuria resolved.
.
#. Anemia: In the setting of bleeding from his lower GU tract,
the patient was noted to have a normocytic anemia.  With
resolution of hi
