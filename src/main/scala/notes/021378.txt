Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**9-18**] CT cspine: C5 spinous process fx

SAH, no obvious facial fxs

[**9-19**] CT head: Stable
[**9-19**] C-spine: C5 fx unchanged
[**9-19**] CXR: Right subclavian catheter, endotracheal tube and
Nasogastric tube in correct place. Increased opacification at
the right base, suggesting aspiration or pneumonia in the right
lower lobe.
[**9-20**] CXR: increase in bilateral lower lobe opacities, greater on
the left side due to atelectasis and/or aspiration
[**9-21**] CXR: Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
[**9-22**] CXR: no change in the position of the ET tube, enteric
tube, or right subclavian central venous catheter. No
pneumothorax. Unchanged hazy basilar opacity that may represent
aspiration. Less atelectasis at lung bases.
[**9-22**] CXR: slight improvement in consolidations in right lower
lung. The left basal atelectasis has improved as well.
[**9-22**] EEG: No epileptiform activity
[**9-22**] CXR: R lower lung opacities, L atelectasis
[**9-23**] CT head: stable SAH and IVH, mild ventricular enlargement,
decreased R subgaleal hematoma
[**9-25**] CXR: Right pleural effusion. Increased retrocardiac density
(atelectasis versus pneumonia).
[**9-27**] CT head: stable edema, slightly smaller ventricles. stable
interventricular hemorrhage, subgaleal hematoma. further sinus
opacification.
[**9-28**] MRI brain/ c-spine - prevertebral/posterior soft tissue
swelling C4-C5, marrow edema at C5 lamina fx. Areas of signal
abnl of splenium, body of corpus callosum, pericallosal white
matter, right paramedian cerebellar vermis c/w diffuse axonal
injury. Symmetric signal abnl of cortical spinal tract
propagating towards the mid brain, c/w wallerian degeneration.
[**9-30**] CT head: decrease in cerebral swelling, otherwise unchanged

[**10-4**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: WET READ - NO SOURCE OF INFECTION IN
TORSO. NEARLY RESOLVED LUNG OPACITIES WITH SCATTERED
ATELECTASIS. FINE DETAIL OBSCURED BY BREATHING ARTIFACT AND
ARTIFACT FROM ARM POSITIONING.
[**10-4**] CT head : await final read, no interval changes
[**10-5**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: No abscess is identified.
[**10-6**] CT Head w/ and w/o contrast: No areas of abnormal
enhancement, ? acute or chronic sinusitis, [**Doctor First Name **], No mass effect
or midline shift
[**10-7**] CXR: No change
[**10-8**] B upper Ext U/S: Occlusive thrombus in the superficial
branch of the right basilic vein. Remainder of the bilateral
upper extremity veins are patent.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery was
immediately [**Month/Year (2) 4221**] given his injuries.
[**9-19**]: ICP monitor placed. Patient started on mannitol and Lasix
for elevated intracranial pressures.
[**9-21**]: On exam, decorticate posturing however localizes to pain.
23% Saline begun and mannitol discontinued to attempt to control
intracranial pressures.
[**9-22**]: EEG showed diffuse encephalopathy. Started on
vanc/cipro/zosyn for question aspiration pneumonia. Sputum
growing sparse gram negative rods.
[**9-23**]: In OR, prior to Trach/PEG ICP spiked to 50's, given
Pentothal and hypertonic saline which decreased ICP to 30's.
Procedure was not done and patient was returned to ICU where ICP
returned to teens. Repeat CT head improved.
[**9-24**]: ICP 6-12, no sodium needed, goal SBP<180
[**9-26**]: 1 episode of elevated ICP for 5 min of 36, which came down
by increasing propofol.
[**9-27**]: Repeat CT stable. Underwent tracheostomy and peg. Sputum
culture growing MSSA, sparse yeast, and pan-sensitive
klebsiella.
[**9-28**]: ICP bolt discontinued. MRI showed diffuse axonal injury.
[**9-29**]: Neurosurgery recommended LP, which family declined.
[**9-30**]: Family discussion with all teams where family was told of
poor prognosis. Repeat CT head showed improvement in ventricle
size. Decision by family to proceed with care.
[**10-1**]: Posturing on left side with minimal to no movement on
right side. No eye opening.
[**10-4**] CT head: No change. No evidence of increased mass effect.
Sinus aspirate showed staph aureus, gram positive rods, and
yeast. BAL showed 4+ PMNs and 3+ gram negative rods.
[**10-5**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: No abscess is identified. Desaturation to 70's in
MRI, new vent need. CXR showed LLL collapse; underwent
bronchoscopy.
[**10-6**]: CT Head with and without contrast: No areas of abnormal
enhancement, ? acute or chronic sinusitis, [**Doctor First Name **], No mass effect
or midline shift.
[**10-7**]: sputum growing MRSA and rare yeast.
[**10-8**]: Bilateral upper extremity ultrasound showed occlusive
thrombus in the superficial branch of the right basilic vein.
Remainder of the bilateral upper extremity veins were patent.
Ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were stopped
[**10-11**]: Sinus aspirate and sputum grew sparse Staph; patient
started on Linezolid.
[**10-13**]: Negative c. Diff culture
[**10-19**]: A pressure ulcer was noted at insertion site of his PEG
tube. The wound ostomy nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] and have made
recommendations for care (see Page 1 under wound care).
[**10-23**]: Linezolid discontinued.
[**10-25**]: Received word that he has been accepted by [**Hospital3 **]
which is the family's first choice of facilities.
