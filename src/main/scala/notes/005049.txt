Service:  Urology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old female
with a history of diabetes and hypertension who was recently
diagnosed with a right renal mass after presenting with frank
hematuria.  A CT scan done at [**Hospital3 15174**]
showed a 10-cm X 9-cm right renal cell mass with a necrotic
center and no contrast excretion.  No evidence of metastatic
disease was seen.  She did not have any preoperative
biopsies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does have a past medical history
of difficult to control hypertension, insulin-dependent
diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, mild chronic dementia.
Additionally, she has a history of Clostridium difficile
diarrhea with chronic relapses; treated with multiple courses
of Flagyl.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She is status post colectomy in [**2137**]
for cancer.  She has had varicose vein stripping in the past.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin 70/30, Tagamet,
allopurinol, aspirin, Cardizem, Toprol-XL, Lasix, Zestril.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**2156-3-29**].  She underwent preoperative right renal kidney
embolization followed by going to the operating room on
[**2156-3-30**], and underwent a right radical nephrectomy
utilizing a thoracoabdominal approach.  She left the
operating room with a chest tube, epidural catheter, and
Foley.  The patient was in stable condition.  She had lost
approximately 900 cc intraoperatively and was resuscitated
with 6000 cc of lactated Ringer's.  Urine output for the case
was 335 cc, and she was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood
cells intraoperatively.  She was given imipenem
preoperatively for a Klebsiella urinary tract infection as
well as to empirically cover her embolization procedure, and
this was continued postoperatively.

On the present admission, when she was sent to the operating
room, she came out in stable condition.  She was able to be
placed in the Intensive Care Unit and was monitored over the
next couple of days.  She was easily extubated.  The chest
tube was followed serially and had a persistent air leak.
Ultimately, this was removed by postoperative day seven.  A
follow-up x-ray showed just a small residual right apical
pneumothorax.

1.  NEUROLOGY:  From a neurologic standpoint, the patient
remained alert and oriented and appropriate throughout her
postoperative course. She was originally managed on an
epidural and ultimately transitioned to a patient-controlled
analgesia and then to oral pain medications including
Percocet as needed.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Cardiac wise, the patient was stable.
She was continued on her preoperative antihypertensives.
Postoperatively, in the acute period she was treated with
Lopressor intravenously and hydralazine, and ultimately was
converted over to her Adalat and Toprol-XL.

3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION/GASTROINTESTINAL:  Her diet
was advanced slowly.  Ultimately, on postoperative day four,
she was placed on a regular diet and she was tolerating this
without difficulty.

4.  GENITOURINARY/RENAL:  Her renal function throughout her
hospitalization remained stable.  She did have creatinine
values as high as 1.6, but was otherwise making adequate
urine, and the Foley catheter was removed postoperatively
without any retention problems.  She did notice a gouty flare
and was ultimately started on colchicine and Indocin as
needed.  She did have some mild congestive symptoms that were
treated with empiric intravenous Lasix, and this subsided
quickly.  Her blood sugars were well controlled throughout
the postoperative course on a sliding-scale, and she was
ultimately was put back on her home regimen.

She did have persistent diarrhea, and an Infectious Disease
consultation was obtained, and they recommended another
course of Flagyl to be continued for 14 days total.

By postoperative day 10, the patient was afebrile and vital
signs were stable.  She was tolerating a diet and ambulating
with assistance.  Her examination was otherwise benign.  Her
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  The wound was
clipped and stripped.  No evidence of drainage.  Extremities
were not edematous.  No jugular venous distention on
examination.  Lungs were otherwise clear.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Colchicine 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
 2.  Indocin 25 mg to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.
 3.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
 4.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. (to be continued for a 14-day
course; 9 days from discharge).
 5.  Desitin 1 tube applied topically p.r.n.
 6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
 7.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
 8.  Flovent meter-dosed inhaler 1 puff p.o. b.i.d.
 9.  Albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
10.  Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
11.  Adalat 30 mg p.o. q.d.
12.  Insulin 70/30 14 units q.a.m. and 8 units q.p.m.
13.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
14.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
15.  .....................
16.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. (can start one week after
discharge).

PATHOLOGY:  The patient's pathology ultimately came back as a
grade II and III clear cell carcinoma with capsular
penetration, but 0/12 nodes negative.  Additionally, the
surgical margins were negative.  The renal mass measured
12 cm X 9 cm X 8 cm in total.  For further review, please see
final pathology report and surgical Operative Note for
further details.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation where she will remain
with aggressive physical therapy, nutrition counseling, and
finish out her Flagyl course for Clostridium difficile
diarrhea.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] in
one to two weeks and should see her primary care physician in
one to two weeks (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Interventional Radiology will
require no followup with this patient as she did the
embolization procedure to reduce the tumor size and allow for
her improved surgical resection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Status post right thoracoabdominal radical nephrectomy.
 2.  Status post preoperative embolization for tumor size
reduction.
 3.  Clear cell carcinoma of the kidney with negative nodes
and negative surgical margins with evidence of capsular
invasion, grade II and III seen on the pathology.
 4.  Clostridium difficile diarrhea.
 5.  Gout.
 6.  Hypertension.
 7.  Diabetes.
 8.  Dementia.
 9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10.  Status post colon cancer with resection.
11.  History of congestive heart failure.
