Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from VA for second opinion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
73M with h/o PMR, ILD with home O2 of 4-6L and on chronic
steroids, OSA and DM2 presented to WX VA on [**2168-4-18**] with
increased DOE, increased O2 req of 7-9L, productive cough with
green sputum x3 days after recent head cold.

Prior to this, pt had baseline exercise tolerance of 50-100
steps, but now has declined to only about 8 steps.  Also
endorsed orthopnea and low grade fever.

In the hospital, initially satting mid 90s on 7L nasal cannula;
- pt was empirically started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
CAP,
- was given IVF for iatrogenic [**Last Name (un) **] [**12-31**] to diuresis,
- desaturation to low 60s on max flow HFNC and bipap,
- requiring emergent intubation on [**4-20**] and transfer to ICU,
where pt had worsenening GGOs on CT, initiation of vancomycin
for [**12-2**] GPCs, cefepime for broadened coverage, bactrim for PCP
coverage and solumedrol burst.
- Pt tolerated pressure control better than ARDS net
ventilation.
- Pt briefly required levofed
- Pt tolerated tube feeds since [**4-22**]
- Pt stopped vanco and azithromycin
- Had high glucan>400 so continued on bactrim for concern of
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] bactrim switched to atovaquone for hyperkalemia.
- Pt spiked to 100.6 on [**5-3**] and pan cultured including c diff
which were all negative.
- Pt's vent settings on transfer were pressure of 15/12 FIO2 50%
for sats in mid to low 90s.
- Family requested second opinion re: whether he will ever get
off vent.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. 98.4  96/59 77  97% on PS
[**9-9**] 50% FIO2.  He does not awaken to voice or touch.

CT CHEST [**2168-5-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval improvement in degree of acute-to-subacute patchy
ground-glass opacification with accompanying septal thickening
with intervening normal areas of lung on a background of
unchanged to slightly progressed subpleural interstitial
abnormality with traction bronchiectasis, but no discrete
honeycombing.

In total this pattern is suspicious for acute interstitial
pneumonia on a
background of interstitial lung disease.  PCP infection
superimposed on
chronic interstitial lung disease is an alternate consideration.
It is
unlikely to reflect pulmonary edema or bacterial infection.

2.  Interval decrease in degree of lymphadenopathy in the
mediastinum and hila which is likely reactive for the ongoing
interstitial process.
3.  Enlarged ascending aorta to 4.8 cm.
4.  Nasogastric tube tents the stomach and could be withdrawn by
approximately 1 cm.

EEG
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study due to
diffuse background slowing and attenuation with intermittent
brief runs
of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA). These
findings
are indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction of
non-specific etiology. No epileptiform discharges or
electrographic
seizures are present. Note is made of an irregularly irregular
rapid
cardiac rhythm and occasional wide complex premature cardiac
beats.

CT chest [**2168-5-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval development of moderate bibasilar right greater
than left likely atelectasis with otherwise little change in the
degree of interstitial abnormality presumed to reflect acute
exacerbation of chronic interstitial lung disease.
2. Unchanged Ascending aortic dilatation
3. Decreased mediastinal adenopathy.

CTA head [**2168-5-18**]
IMPRESSION:
  1.  No evidence of acute vascular territorial ischemia, though
no dedicated perfusion sequence was requested or performed.
  2.  No flow-limiting stenosis, significant mural irregularity,
aneurysm larger than 2 mm, or dissection of the cranial vessels.

  3.  Complete opacification of the mastoid air cells and middle
ear cavities, and aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid air
cell, likley related to prolonged intubation and supine
positioning.

CXR [**2168-5-21**]

Comparison is made with prior studies from [**5-17**] and 20th.

The appearance of the cardiomediastinum is unchanged.
Cardiomegaly is
moderate.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior
CT from [**5-18**].  Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position.
 Right PICC tip is difficult to evaluate, can be followed to the
lower SVC.  There is no
pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side are
unchanged,
likely atelectasis.  Patient has known chronic interstitial lung
disease,
superimposed there is increasing diffuse density of the
interstitial markings. This suggests again exacerbation of the
chronic interstitial lung disease, less likely edema.

[**2168-5-21**] MRI of head with contrast
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is no evidence of acute or subacute intracranial
process,
specifically no diffusion abnormalities are demonstrated to
indicate acute
ischemic event.

2.  Possible lacunar ischemic change versus prominent
perivascular space noted
of the right basal ganglia, unchanged since the prior head CT.
Slightly
prominent ventricles and sulci, possibly age-related and
indicating mild
cortical volume loss.

3.  Unchanged bilateral opacities noted of the mastoid air
cells, likely
related with prolonged intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo M with ILD, OSA, presents from VA for second opinion on
tracheostomy after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation 2/2 acute
on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure from pneumonia in the
setting of rapidly progressing interstitial lung disease.

# Respiratory Failure - At VA pt initially presented with
symptoms consistent with viral URI, but given severe underlying
ILD, he rapidly decompensated requiring mechanical ventilation.
Pt was treated for bacterial pneumonia, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**
