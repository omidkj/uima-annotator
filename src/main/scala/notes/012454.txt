IMPRESSION:

Brief Hospital Course:
84M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, prostate cancer s/p XRT, multiple
UTI's, COPD on 3 LNC with severe pulm htn and severe R sided
systolic function admitted for altered mental status with
leukocytosis and evidence of UTI and Pneumonia.

# AMS:  Patient with acutely altered mental status.  He is at
baseline, pleasant and interactive - alert and oriented to
person and place.  He was found to have RLL infiltrate on CXR
with associated leukocytosis and also found to have a dirty
urine.  NC Head CT was unremarkable and revealed no acute
pathology.
   He was placed on iv cefipime and azithromycin (for presumed
HAP) and responded well to this regimen.  His mentation returned
to baseline and he was afebrile with normalization of his WBC.
He was transitioned to PO levofloxacin.  There were no other
etiologies to account for his confusion - there was no evidence
of CO2 retention based on the venous BG.  Sedatives were avoided
and no restraints were indicated.

# presumed UTI: Pt w/ h/o recurrent UTIs including pseudomonal,
proteus (R to cipro/bactrim/amp), enterococcus (R to
tetracycline), and klebsiella.  UA on presentation consistent
with urinary tract infection but urine culture returned
negative.  He had some evidence of urinary retention - but
difficult to assess post void residual given his incontinence.
He was placed on finasteride and may benefit from flomax or
other alpha-blocker as outpt assuming he does not get
orthostatic.  This should hopefully minimize the risk of future
urinary tract infections.  The levofloxacin should be completed
to address the urinary tract infection.

# Pneumonia:  Right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR with
leukocytosis no bands.  Patient resides in nursing home so
treated for health care associated pneumonia in ICU - with
cefipime and vancomycin.  There initially was concern for
aspiration given altered mental status and location of
pneumonia.  Speech/swallow eval revealed no overt evidence of
aspiration and the suggestion was to continue with present diet.
 Sputum cultures contaminated with respiratory flora.
   Of note, a single set of blood culture from admission
returned positive for coag negative staph and iv vancomycin was
initiated.  However,surveillance cx were negative and the other
set of blood cxs on the same day have been negative to date.  As
a result, this was left untreated and vancomycin was
discontinued.  Incidentally, a MRSA Screen of the nares was
performed to assess for the MRSA colonization.  It returned
positive.  There was however, no evidence of active MRSA
infection.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 2.7 elevated from
baseline of 1.4-1.8.  Lactic acid elevated at 2.5. Likely
secondary to volume depletion in setting of infection.  IV
fluids given and creatinine trended down to 1.4.  Diuretics was
discontinued and we recommend it to be held until there is
evidence of congestive heart failure.  The lisinopril was also
held and can be resumed if BP is elevated.  During this
