Shortness of breath

Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 77483**] is a 72 year old man with extensive cardiac history
including CAD s/p STEMI with 4 vessel CABG IN [**2161**], NSTEMI in
[**2-/2175**] s/p PTCA to SVG-RCA with BMS, NSTEMI in [**3-/2176**] s/p cath
without intervention, presenting from home for elective cath
given progressive dyspnea on exertion.

Briefly, patient has been having severe, limiting dyspnea
starting [**10-28**], progressing and recently brought out with
minimal exertion, recently with walking 10 steps. Denies any
chest pain or chest pressure, syncope, presyncope, no light
headedness, blurry vision, orthopnea or PND.

During cath, AO 119/61, MAP 84, HR 66, LMCA with mild disease,
LAD occluded, LCx 70% disease, RCA occluded, SVT OM1/OM2 with
70% new mid stenosis and SVG-RCA with 90% in stent restenosis in
RPL. Attempts were made to dilate the latter however this was
technically very challenging. There is reported wire trauma
distally to the site of intervention. Stat ECHO was obtained in
the lab and patient was transferred to CCU for further
management.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG:
Tracing reveal normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per minute,
normal intervals except QTc 470, inferior Q waves suggestive of
prior infarct, overall low voltages, poor R wave progression,
compared to prior from [**2176-4-10**] no diagnostic change is
present.

TELEMETRY:
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  ([**2176-11-1**]
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with anterior, anteroseptal and apical akinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad. No right atrial or
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: Trivial pericardial effusion on the background of a
thick anterior pericardial fat pad. Moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w LAD disease.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-4-11**],
the findings (including a tiny pericardial effusion) are
similar.

Catheterization: [**2176-11-1**]
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 6 French AR1 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Graft Angiography:  of 2 saphenous vein bypass grafts were
performed
using a 5 French multipurpose and AR-1 catheter, with manual
contrast
injections. Percutaneous coronary revascularization was
performed using placement of drug-eluting stent(s). Conscious
Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
showed
severe three vessel coronary artery diseas status post bypass
surgery.



Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old man with extensive coronary artery disease, s/p CABG
in [**2161**], s/p repeat NSTEMI, presenting with progressive angina,
s/p failed intervention to SVG-RCA graft complicated by
perforation of graft and development of small pericardial
effusion.

# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Patient with progressive chronic CAD,
without unstable symptoms. Intervention was unsuccessful and
given the complication will need to reassess the risks vs
benefitis for further planning. At this time, since no new stent
was deployed, no systemic anticoagulation was indicated. Given
wire trauma, pt was monitored and assessed for pericardial
tamponade.  Aspirin, Plavix, and Statin were continued.
Metoprolol and spironolactone were briefly held given concern
for hypotension with tamponade.  Pt remained stable.  There was
no evidence of tamponade.

# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  EF idepressed at baseline, 30
to 35% at this time. Currently euvolemic and with significant
dye load, pt was not diuresed overnight.  Once concern for
tamponade had abated, he was restarted on BB and spironolactone.
 He was on a betablocker, but not and ACEI.  ACE Inhibitor is
recommended in this patient which may be started as an
outpatient, pending no contraindication.
