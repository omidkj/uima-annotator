CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman with TR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusions
CHEST TWO VIEWS ON [**4-13**]

HISTORY: Triscuspid regurg, check effusions.

REFERENCE EXAM: [**4-11**].

FINDINGS: There is moderate cardiomegaly with moderate bilateral
pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular redistribution
consistent with CHF. There is fluid and azygos fissure. An
incomplete ring of a valve replacement is seen overlying the
spine on the frontal film and overlying the mid heart on the
lateral film. The appearance of this incomplete ring was
discussed with the cardiac surgeon on call (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

IMPRESSION: Increased CHF.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Cilated IVC (>2.5cm) with
no change
with respiration (estimated RAP >20 mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal
regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV
free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TS. Severe [4+]
TR. Eccentric TR jet. Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated
right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are three
aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] came in for scheduled surgery on [**4-8**] however had eaten
breakfast that morning. She was admitted to the floor and then
taken to the operating room on [**4-9**] where she underwent a TV
repair with a #30 CE annuloplasty ring. She was transferred to
the ICU in critical but stable condition. She was seen by
pulmonology post op for pulmonary [**Month/Day (4) **]. Recommendations included
outpatient w/u, as well as treatment for her diastolic
dysfunction - diuresis, rate control and afterload reduction.
Her vasoactive drips were weaned to off and she was extubated by
POD #2. She was transferred to the floor on POD #2. She was seen
by physical therapy and continued to progress.  She was ready
for discharge to rehab on POD 5.
