Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
68 year old male presents for after being called by his PCP's
office for abnormal test results. Patient states that he had
seen his PCP last week for evaluation of back pain. At that
visit, patient had blood drawn and was called one week later
(Friday) because he had an elevated WBC count of 23.2 with left
shift neuts 81 without fever, H/H of 8.8/25.5, and
BUN/Creatinine of 51/1.90. Patient was asked to report to ER
last night, but was unable to find a ride.
Upon questioning the patient, he states that he has generally
felt well but has had some fatigue for the past several days. He
denies having any chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, dyspnea,
CP or signs of bleeding.
In the ER, preliminary lab work up showed an elevation in
Troponin T to 0.23, CK 1874, CK-MB 32. Cr 2.0 EKG showed NSR,
1V3 with 1mm ST elevation; felt to be most likely demand
ischemia. Patient's WBC was 17.2, HCT 23.5. Patient
hemodynamically stable, found to have melena on rectal
examination. Patient's VS in the ER were 98.5 76, 117/61 RR 16
98%RA. Type and Crossed x4, IV protonix.
On tranfer to CCU, patient's VS were HR 70 BP 113/54 100%2L RR
12.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Blood Culture [**11-8**]: No growth

CXR [**11-8**]: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

ECHO [**11-10**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Severe pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o M with NSTEMI in setting of demand ischemia from GI bleed
and cocaine use.

# NSTEMI: Patient reported 2 day history of dyspnea and chest
discomfort which resolved spontaneously but was associated with
elevated cardiac enzymes (CK 1874, CK-MB 32, Trop-T 0.23) but no
ST elevations on EKG. CK elevation disproportionate to Troponin
was also suggestive of cocaine use and/or known dermatomyositis.
 Ischemia was through to be precipitated by anemia from GI bleed
since recent cath showed 30% stenosis of two vessels, thus
recath was not done. Pt was medically managed iwth ASA, statin,
plavix and beta blocker and discharged with close follow up at
[**Hospital1 112**] where he gets his usual care.

# GI Bleed: Pt was guaiac positive with a hematocrit of 23.5 in
the emergency room, and unclear source upper or lower. He was
transufed 3 total units of pRBCs given ischemia and hematocrit
and pt's hemodynamics remained stable. Pt was evaluated by GI
who recommended holding off scope in setting of NSTEMI. He had
had a colonoscopy at OSH iwth known AVMs, polyps and recent GI
bleed. Pt was medically managed with IV protonix and discharged
on home PPI.

# Dermatomyositis: Continued on outpt regimen of prednisone
without complications.

# Cocaine use: Patient was counseled about the cardiac dangers
of this drug. He denied current use although had positive tox
screen and documented use in OSH records.

# Leukocytosis: WBC high teens to low 20s, attributed to
prednisone. No sign of infection as pt was afebrile, vital signs
stable, blood cultures, U/A and urine cultures negative and
lactate negative.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: On presenation pt's Cr was 2
and trended down to 1.5 on discharge. Medications were
appropriately renally dosed.

# Plan of care: Patient would likely be better served at [**Hospital1 112**]
where he is well known and has all medical records. We contact[**Name (NI) **]
the covering cardiologist for his outpatient cardiologist Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] who asked that the patient see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] shortly after
discharge.
