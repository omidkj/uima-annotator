Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
58 y/o man with PMH significant for hypertension and type 2
diabetes mellitus presented with chest pressure and admitted
through the ED with concern for a type 2 abdominal aortic
dissection.
.
Patient was in his normal state of health until approximately
10:30 this morning when he developed [**2110-6-12**] chest tightness
radiating to his back as he was finishing moving his bowels.
This was associated with diaphoresis but no SOB, nausea, or
vomiting. He reports that he checked his blood sugar
approximately one hour after his sympoms started and it was 124.
After exepriencing the pain without relief for approximately two
hours, the pt came to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaulation.
.
In further ROS, he denies recent fevers or chills. No headaches.
No other episodes of chest pain or tightness. No SOB. Pt sleeps
flat at night with no difficulty. He reports that he likes to
walk and will often walk for up to five hours without difficulty
in warm weather. He denies any joint pain. He has been
experiencing increased leg "cramps" over the last week.
.
In the ED, the pt's VS were 97.6 88 190/70 14 100% on 2L NC. He
received a total of 15 mg IV lopressor but continued to be very
hypertensive with a SBP in the 170s to 180s. Given the pt's
sympoms there was a concern for aortic dissection so a CTA was
obtained which was concerning for a possible dissection near the
[**Female First Name (un) 899**]. Pt was placed on an esmolol drip with goal SBP of 110 and a
[**Female First Name (un) 1106**] surgery consult was obtained. As it is unclear if it is
a true abdominal aorta vs artifact, they wished to admit him to
the MICU for close monitoring and BP control until Monday at
which time an aortogram will be obtained.
.
In the MICU the patient was continued on esmolol gtt with goal
SBP <120.  He was ruled out for MI by 3 sets negative cardiac
enzymes.  [**Female First Name (un) **] surgery followed and recommended repeat CTA
abdomen in place of aorto-gram.  Repeat CTA demonstrated stable
appearance of abdominal aortic intimal flap near [**Female First Name (un) 899**].  However,
indcidental finding of concurrent PE in the right main pulmonary
artery was found.  Patient was started on heparin gtt and
coumadin.  He was also started on labetolol for blood pressure
control, and the esmolol gtt was titrated off.  Patient had been
on pneumoboots during his hospitalization.  He has a previous
smoking history, but quit 18yrs ago.  He has had no recent
travel.  He notes recent exacerbations of "[**Last Name (un) **] horse"
muscular spasms in his legs, but these were bilateral.  He has
had no further episodes of chest pain, pressure, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, or nausea since his hospitalization.
.
He notes prior to this hospitalization, over the past year, he
has noted episodes of diarrhea and urgency that occur every
3-4days.  Stools are nonbloody and not black.  Also on ROS he
noted occasional episodes of blurry vision when his blood sugars
vary, and an enlarging mole on his right thigh.  He denies
headaches, dizziness, changes in hearing, dysuria, arthralgias,
myalgias, rashes.


Past Medical History:
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus- Pt was diagnosed in [**2099**]. He
started on insulin for improved blood sugar control
approximately 2.5 year ago.
2. [**Name (NI) **] Pt reports that he always had good blood
pressure with an average SBP of 120 until one year ago when it
became elevated. He was started on an antihypertensive
medication approximately six weeks ago.
3. Hypercholesterolemia
4. Nephrolithiasis

Social History:
Pt lives alone and is self employed in real estate. He quit
smoking approximately 18 years ago after smoking 1.5ppd for 22
years. He drinks three ETOH drinks per day. No history of DTs.
No drugs.

Radiology:
CTA Chest/Abd [**2105-6-6**]: Intimal flap of the descending aorta at
the level of the take off of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**], consistent with short,
focal type B aortic dissection. The intimal flap is only seen on
two axial images, however, is confirmed on thin cut coronal and
sagittal reformats.  There is no proximal or distal extension
into the iliacs. The celiac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and renal arteries are
patent, and there is no evidence of abnormal perfusion to the
major abdominal and upper pelvic organs.
.
CTA Chest Abd [**2105-6-8**]:
1)  Small nonocclusive, but central PE in the right main
pulmonary artery
extending into the lower lobe branch.  This is new and was not
seen in the
prior CT 2 days ago.
2)  Focal 9 mm dissection of the abdominal aorta at the  level
of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
origin.  There is no evidence of fluid around it and there is no
change in
comparison to the prior CT.  The aorta otherwise is normal.
3)  Markedly distended bladder.  The lower portion of the pelvis
is not
included in the scan, according to the dissection protocol.
4)  Contrast excretion through the gallbladder.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o man with h/o hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus
presenting with chest pressure diagnosed with dissecting
abdominal aortic aneurysm and new onset pulmonary embolism.
During his hospitalization the following problems were
addressed:
1.  Chest pain/ dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm:  CTA in
the ED confirmed diagnosis of dissecting AAA 1.7x1.6cm with 9mm
dissection at the region of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] take-off from aorta.  He was
started on an esmolol gtt for BP control with goal SBP <120, and
admitted to the MICU.  Pain was initially controlled with iv
morphine in the ED.  He had no further episodes of pain.  He was
started on labetolol and the esmolol titrated off.  [**Female First Name (un) **]
surgery followed the patient while in the MICU.  They
recommended continued medical management, with plans for
reevaluation by CTA and [**Female First Name (un) 1106**] surgery follow-up 2-3 months
after the initial even
