Admission Date:  [**2108-10-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2108-11-14**]


Service:  ACOVE

ADDENDUM: Medicine

HOSPITAL COURSE SINCE PREVIOUS DICTATION:  1.  PULMONARY:  On
transfer to the ACOVE Service from the MICU, the patient improved
dramatically from a respiratory standpoint.  He was continued on
oxygen and his nebulizer treatments with oxygen saturations
approximately 90% on 2 liters.  The patient had a chest x-ray
that seemed consistent with aspiration and he was briefly started
on levofloxacin and Flagyl.

On [**2108-11-7**], the patient had an episode of hypoxia
to 68% with an ABG of 7.18/73/57.  The patient was placed on
humidified oxygen with saturations around 90-92% and was
suctioned.  The patient was noted to have thick tenacious
sputum.  A stat chest x-ray was ordered that showed no
changes.  The patient had chest PT at this time for
percussive therapy and was noted to have a blood pressure of
80/30 and was subsequently bolused with normal saline.

Given minimal responsiveness to sternal rub, the patient was
again transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.  The
patient was intubated in the SICU and was placed on levo,
ceftazidime, and vancomycin for pneumonia.  The patient was
eventually weaned from the ventilator and improved dramatically
from a respiratory standpoint.  He was continued on all
nebulizers and received frequent suctioning.  The etiology of the
patient's hypoxic respiratory failure was considered likely
multifactorial including his diastolic heart failure, pneumonia,
and COPD.  The patient was treated for his mild diastolic heart
failure.

A sputum sent on [**2108-11-7**] grew out MRSA and the
patient's levofloxacin and ceftazidime were stopped and he
was kept on vancomycin IV.  He received a PICC line and it is
anticipated that the patient will receive a full 14 day
course of IV vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was noted
to have a troponin leak in the setting of respiratory
distress considered secondary to demand ischemia.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, Lopressor, and statin and
it is anticipated that he will have a more thorough cardiac
workup as an outpatient.  Notably, the patient's CK and CK MB
were normal and stable throughout his stay.

Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], the patient had an
echocardiogram which was significant for an EF of over 55%,
moderate symmetrical LVH, mild pulmonary hypertension, and an
E/A ratio of 0.67.  It is likely that the patient has
diastolic dysfunction and in addition to a beta blocker was
kept on Lasix 40 mg q.d. for likely volume overload.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On discharge from the MICU, the
patient improved from a pulmonary standpoint but could not be
weaned from oxygen.  The chest x-ray was significant for a
retrocardiac pneumonia and the patient was started on
levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
The patient subsequently had a hypoxic respiratory distress
and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where sputum was sent and
came back with MRSA.  The patient was started on vancomycin
and will receive this for 14 days.  He remained afebrile
throughout his hospital stay.

4.  MENTAL STATUS:  The patient was transferred with the
diagnosis of delirium that was considered multifactorial,
potential etiologies include psychotropic medications that
the patient had received, hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory
arrest as well as baseline dementia.  After the patient was
extubated for the third time, his mental status improved
significantly.  He was followed by the Psychiatry Team who
felt that his delirium was most likely secondary to his
multiple medical problems and recommended treating his
medical problems and following up in the future with an MRI
once the patient was stable.  The patient was noted to have
symptoms consistent with sundowning with an acute increase in
his confusion at night; however, the patient's mental status
was appropriate during the day and he was noted to be alert
and oriented prior to discharge.

5.  RENAL:  The patient was noted on transfer to have an
elevated creatinine which was thought likely secondary to
dehydration.  He was fluid resuscitated but continued to have
increasing creatinine to a maximum of 2.8.  The [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Team
thought that the patient's acute renal failure was secondary
to possible hypoxemia and the patient's creatinine after he
was extubated eventually improved to 1.1 prior to discharge.

6.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
evaluated by the Speech and Swallow Team and had a video
fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation which was negative for
aspiration.  Prior to discharge, his diet was advanced to
pureed solids and regular thin liquids.  It was anticipated
that the patient's diet will be advanced to a regular diet
after he is transferred to the rehabilitation hospital.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to the [**Hospital6 7068**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Diastolic dysfunction.
2.  Hypercarbic respiratory arrest.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Fluticasone two puffs b.i.d.
3.  Salmeterol 50 micrograms one inhalation q. 12 hours.
4.  Atorvostatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Ipratropium bromide 0.02% one nebulizer q. six hours
p.r.n.
6.  Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d. times two days, 10 mg p.o.
q.d. times two days.
7.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Vancomycin 1 gram IV q.d. times seven days.
9.  Heparin 5,000 units q. eight hours subcutaneously.
10. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is discharged to [**Hospital6 7068**] where he will continue on medications
as prescribed.  He will continue vancomycin for seven days
for MRSA pneumonia.  It is hoped at this time that he will
also be placed on an ACE inhibitor for his antihypertensive
regimen. The patient will be followed by the physicians at
the rehabilitation center.  He is encouraged to contact Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 12798**] at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital to schedule a follow-up
appointment within two weeks of being discharged from
[**Hospital1 **].  If Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12798**] is not taking any new patients,
the patient is welcome to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
[**Hospital 191**] Clinic.
