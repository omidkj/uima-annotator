CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2159-8-9**] 6:18 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Right hydropneumothorax with trace pneumothorax, and small
bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Consolidation in the right upper lobe, likely representing
secondary to aspiration given mucous seen within the right
bronchus.
3. Mild emphysema.
4. Multiple fluid collections throughout the abdomen, with
enhancing appearance of the visceral and parietal peritoneum,
consistent with inflammation.
5. No evidence of oral contrast leak; however, the actual
post-anastomotic anatomy is difficult to assess.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-8-14**] 9:08 PM
AP BEDSIDE CHEST. There is a diffuse interstitial and slight
alveolar edema. The heart is borderline enlarged. Multiple tubes
and catheters are satisfactorily positioned with NG tube having
been advanced into the distal stomach since exam three hours
earlier on same day. Multiple right rib fractures of
undetermined age. Bilateral pleural effusions layering in
semierect position. More prominent opacification in the left
lower thorax may represent effusion and secondary atelectasis,
but superimposed consolidation left lower lobe not excluded. It
is difficult to compare this exam with study three hours earlier
with equivocal overall improvement in vascular congestion.

IMPRESSION: CHF/fluid overload. Equivocal superimposed left
lower lobe pneumonia.

.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2159-8-15**] 3:17 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of simple-appearing bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Mildly increased area of consolidation involving the right
upper lobe as noted.
3. Stable peripancreatic, subphrenic, and intra-abdominal fluid
collections as detailed above.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-8-17**] 2:11 PM
IMPRESSION: No interval change.
1.. No evidence for pneumothorax following left thoracentesis.
Small left residual pleural effusion.
2. Opacities in the right lung unchanged, consistent with
history of pseudomonas pneumonia.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2159-8-20**] 6:25 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. There are no dilated loops of small or large bowel. The
presence of free intraperitoneal air is incompletely evaluated
as upright images are not available.
2. There is a left lower lobe consolidation and left pleural
effusion.
.
CT GUIDED NEEDLE PLACTMENT  [**2159-8-20**] 11:19 AM
IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided aspiration of abdominal fluid
collection.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-8-23**] 8:42 AM
IMPRESSION: Large bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2159-8-24**] 10:59 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man with R hemicolectomy w/ anatomic leak, resp
failure, trach/peg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
dophoff placement
PORTABLE ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION: Dobbhoff tube is seen with tip within the body of
the stomach.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-9-3**] 12:04 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild interval increase in the size of multiple intraabdominal
abscesses. One abscess now extends into the left rectus
musculature.
2. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, which are moderate in
size.
3. New nodular densities in the right middle and lower lobes,
believed to be related to an infectious process in the right
lower lobe and atelectasis in the right middle lobe. Attention
is recommended on followup studies.
4. Left adrenal nodule does not meet CT criteria for a
lipid-[**Doctor First Name **] adenoma on this study. If clinically indicated, this
could be further characterized utilizing an adrenal protocol CT
or MR.
5. Nonobstructing right renal calculus.
.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2159-9-7**]
11:15 AM
IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening of bilateral pleural effusions with probable
adjacent
atelectasis versus consolidation.
 2.  Worsening volume overload vs CHF.
.
CT PERITINEAL DRAIN EXCLUDING APPENDICEAL  [**2159-9-25**] 3:50 PM
Under direct CT guidance, an 18-gauge [**Last Name (un) 4300**] needle was
advanced into the patient's right-sided abdominal fluid
collection. Through this, a wire was introduced followed by
serial dilation before placing a 10 French drainage catheter.
Approximately 40 cc of purulent fluid was obtained. The specimen
was sent for Gram stain and culture. Post-procedure images
demonstrate optimal positioning of the drainage catheter.
IMPRESSION:
Successful CT-guided drainage catheter placement into
intra-abdominal fluid collection.
.
Radiology Report CT PERITINEAL DRAIN EXC Study Date of [**2159-10-2**]
11:08 AM
Using CT fluoroscopic guidance, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was
placed into the splenic fluid collection utilizing Seldinger
technique.  A few cc of fluid resembling old blood were
aspirated from the catheter and sent for culture and stain.
 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a drainage catheter into
the perisplenic fluid collection.
 .
Radiology Report CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2159-10-16**]
1:06 PM
CONCLUSION:
1.  Multiple loculated fluid collections with pockets of air.
There is
history of recent surgery, but increase in the amount of air in
many of these
collections raises the possibility of infection or fistula.
However, no
extravasation of oral contrast was identified.  No evidence of
obstruction.
The oral contrast passes through to the ileostomy bag and also
cont
