[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hx of HTN and acute onset abdominal pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o mesenteric ischemia v/s pancreatitis

IMPRESSION: Ascending colon ischemic colitis: Pneumatosis
intestinalis involving the ascending colon from the level of the
cecum to the hepatic flexure with thick bowel wall and
peripheral hepatic portal venous gas. No intra-abdominal free
air. The remaining loops of large and small bowel are normal.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2170-11-10**] 5:05 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: COLON (RIGHT)

Previous biopsies:    [**-5/3285**]  EGD (1).

DIAGNOSIS:



Ileo-right colonic resection:



1. Ileum and proximal margin:

No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

2. Colon:

a.  Acute ischemic infarction,focally transmural, with mural
hemorrhage and edema, and acute pericolic inflammation.

b.  Distal margin:  No necrosis identified.

c.  Eight pericolic lymph nodes:  No diagnostic abnormalities
recognized.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2170-11-12**]



PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function. Hypotension.
Height: (in) 62
Weight (lb): 199
BSA (m2): 1.91 m2
BP (mm Hg): 152/44
HR (bpm): 85
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2170-11-12**] at 13:20
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis
is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most
likely represents a fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-10-5**], the
findings are
similar.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-11-18**] 11:15 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman s/p right colectomy. Now with confusion.
HISTORY: Status post right colectomy with confusion. Question
infection.

FINDINGS: There are small bilateral pleural effusions that are
new compared to the film from a week ago, the NG tube and ET
tube have been removed. Midline skin staples are visualized.

IMPRESSION: No infiltrate but small bilateral pleural effusions
are present.







Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**2170-11-10**] with pneumatosis intestinalis and CT
finding of portal vein gas. All this on the setting of abdominal
pain, and diarrhea, guaiac positive stools, most likely from
ischemic etiology. The patient was hemodynamically stable and
afebrile. She was admitted to ICU, and started on IV hydration
and antibiotics.
The afternoon of [**2170-11-10**], she developed right sided peritonitis
and had a WBC of 17,000. Given the worsening exam, the decision
was made to go to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy. She was
found to have an ischemic right colon with patchy
transmural infarction of cecum.

Post-operatively she was stable and transferred to the SICU
intubated. POD 5, she was transferred to the floor.

Pain: She received Fentanyl in the SICU with good effect. After
extubation, she received Morphine and Tylenol and was then
switched to Dilaudid.
GI: She had a NGT that was putting out bilious drainage. The NGT
was D/C'd POD 4. Her diet was advanced slowly over the next few
days and she was tolerating a regular diet at time of discharge.
She had +flatus and +BM prior to discharge.
Abd: Her wound was noted to have some slight erythema on POD 2.
She continued with the antibiotics and the erythema improved.
The staples were removed on POD 9. There was no redness or
drainage and the incision was C,D,I.
CV: She received 2 Units of PRBCs on POD 1 and her HCT was
stable in the low 30's. An Echo was obtained POD 2 that showed
LVEF>55%.  Her HR was stable 80-100bpm with 1st degree AV block.
She was on Lopressor IV for HR control. She was started back on
her home medications (Norvasc and Aggrenox) on POD 4 and
switched to PO Lopressor once taking in PO's.
Resp: POD 1, she remained intubated. She was extubated POD 3.
She continued to require O2 by nasal cannula and was encouraged
to use the IS and deep breathe. POD 9, she was 89% on RA and so
will continue on supplemental oxygen.
Renal: She received LR boluses x3 on POD 1 for a low urine
output. She then required daily diuresis thereafter and
responded well to Lasix.
Neuro: Primarily Italian speaking. Confusion regarding location
and date initially that cleared during her stay.
ID: She was on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for 5 days post-op.
PT: She was seen by PT and they recommended a rehab facility.
She was ambulating with a walker and assistance.
