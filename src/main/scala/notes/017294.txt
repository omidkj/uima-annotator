HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 54 year-old
male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
with a three day history of fevers, chills, malaise, anorexia
and a nonproductive cough.  Symptoms started on Friday with a
home temperature of 103.  He took non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs with no relief of the temperature and no
relief of the symptoms.  The patient then stated on Saturday
symptoms progressively got worse with increased fatigue,
anorexia and increase in his nonproductive cough.  The
patient presented to the Emergency Department with these
symptoms with no recent history of sick contacts, travel
exposure or recent admissions for pneumonia or any pulmonary
symptoms or pulmonary diagnoses.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

Status post cerebrovascular accident.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
2. Maxzide 50/75.
3. Norvasc 5 mg q.d.
4. Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
5. Metformin 500 mg b.i.d.
6. Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
7. Aspirin 81 mg.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any recent tobacco,
alcohol or intravenous drug abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 100.3.  Heart
rate 120.  Oxygen sats 90 to 92 percent on room air.
General, he is awake, alert, slightly ill appearing male at
appropriate stated age.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  No lymphadenopathy.
Oropharynx is clear.  Cardiovascular S1 and S2 tachy and
irregular heart rate.  Pulmonary bibasilar crackles,
decreased breath sounds at the right base.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Warm, moist extremities.
Neurological alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves
II through XII are intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 17.6,
hematocrit 43, platelets 270, sodium 133, potassium 3.6,
chloride 91, bicarb 28, BUN 32, creatinine 1.9 up from
baseline of 1.2 to 1.3, glucose 340, negative troponin and CK
MB.  AST 26, ALT 29. Follow up chest x-ray showed
opacifications at the right lower lobe.  Initial chest x-ray
showed right lower lobe infiltrate.  On admission lactate
level was greater then 4.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 169, repeat electrocardiogram also
showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 129 with a right
bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit with a diagnosis of pneumonia and because of the
increased lactic acid value the Must protocol was put into
place for rule out of sepsis.  The patient was also found to
be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate with a right
bundle branch block.  The origin of these findings were not
known, although it is presumed, because the right internal
jugular central line was put in and a line was found to be in
the right ventricle that this could have sensitized the heart
to this arrythmia.  Throughout the hospital course the
patient did not have any atrial fibrillation once being
transferred up to the medical floors nor did he have a rapid
rate or right bundle branch block.  The patient throughout
his stay was started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for six
days.  Sputum cultures were not obtained due to no production
of cough.  Blood cultures continued upon discharge showed no
growth.  Chest x-ray showed resolving right lower lobe
pneumonia.  The patient was started on heparin and Coumadin
for his presumed atrial fibrillation, although telemetry
strips did not show it through the rest of his hospital
course.  For his diabetes he was started on an insulin
sliding scale and Metformin was held due to his increased
creatinine.  Glyburide was also given. The patient's
creatinine did decrease down to baseline, which was 1.2 to
1.3 during hospital stay, because of adequate fluid hydration
and because of decreased signs of infection.  The patient
would maintain low grade fevers in the 100 to 101 degrees
Fahrenheit and would spike to 100.7 in the afternoon during
his admission.  Upon discharge he had been afebrile for 48
hours.  The patient also had been ruled out for myocardial
infarction during admission and because vital signs stayed
stable while in the Intensive Care Unit it was not assumed
that he was in an active sepsis.  After being transferred to
the floor the patient was continued on Azithromycin and
Ceftriaxone, remained afebrile.  White count continued to go
down to 11.  Lipitor was continued for his hyperlipidemia.
Also while in house an echocardiogram showed normal ejection
fraction greater then 55 percent.  No signs of endocarditis
and mild mitral regurgitation.  Upon hospital discharge after
discussing with attending physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] the patient
was evaluated as being afebrile for greater then 48 hours and
for having a decreasing white blood cell count and improving
oxygenation and although he had been up to 4 liters while in
house he was now on no supplemental oxygen and was satting
100 percent.  Blood cultures continued to have no growth up
until discharge and the patient found alleviation of some
cough symptoms using Albuterol inhaler.  The patient was seen
by physical therapy who concluded that the patient could go
home without any services, although the patient did request
some sort of visiting nurse service.  This is being followed
by the case manager and appropriate accommodations will be
made for the patient to go home with some sort of service to
follow up on his medical and treatment regimen. The patient
will be discharged with eight days of Levaquin 500 mg q.d. to
complete a 14 day course of antibiotics.  The patient also
during his admission because of his hypertension was started
on his Maxzide and Zestril and then given Norvasc on
discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with service.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia.

Rule out sepsis.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

Status post cerebrovascular accident.

Diabetes.

Atrial fibrillation with right bundle branch block.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Maxzide 75/15.
2. Lipitor 10.
3. Lisinopril 40.
4. Metformin 500 b.i.d.
5. Glyburide 5 b.i.d.
6. Albuterol inhaler.
7. Levaquin 500 mg q.d. times eight days.
8. Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s.
9. Norvasc 5 mg q.d.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in two weeks.  An appointment was
made for [**7-14**] and arrangements were made for the patient
to make that appointment.  The patient will also discuss with
case manager any sort of follow up services to be done in the
home.  The patient was reminded about symptoms of pneumonia
that do not resolve with home antibiotics and home risk
therapy and to return if symptoms worsen or are not resolved
within a week to ten days.  The patient was also encouraged
to keep his follow up appointments to discuss any changes in
his regimen with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  The patient will also return to
see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding his anticoagulation for his atrial
fibrillation, which has apparently resolved while in the
hospital.  The patient will also follow up on his blood
sugars as they were high while in the hospital.  This may
have been secondary to stress response.
