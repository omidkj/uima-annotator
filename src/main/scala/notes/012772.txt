Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with diastolic dysfunction, CHF, atrial tach s/p
pacer admitted with pulmonary edema likely in setting of
stopping lasix.
.
1. SOB: Pulm edema likely in setting of stopping lasix. No
evidence of pna on cxr.  Diuresed with lasix IV and cont nitro
gtt for afterload reduction.  She is running even at time of
discharge with no residual SOB.  Will continue lasix 20mg daily
per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1016**] upon discharge.
.
2. CAD: Ruled out for MI x 3 by enzymes. Initiall held BB but
then started Metoprolol 50mg TID. Will change to Toprol XL 150mg
daily upon discharge.  Cont ASA. Cont. Statin.  Jaw and arm pain
concerning for angina.  Cardiac enzymes negative x 3.  Results
of interrogation yielded atrial tachycardia (due to AFib) and
normally functioning pacemaker.
.
3. Left arm pain.  While the pt. ruled out for MI, the etiology
of this pain, and the associated mild jaw pain that accompanied
it frequently during this visit is unclear.  Could be angina.
Pt states that she does not want cardiac catheterization.  Based
on this, did not perform stress test during this
hospitalization.  We observed that better BP control did
alleviate these symptoms.
.
4. Pump:  Nitro patch continued and Beta Blocker.  Is running
even now s/p diuresis of fluid overload on admission.
.
5. A fib.  This is longstanding A fib yielding multiple episodes
of tachycardia that could be contributing to hypotension.
Pacemaker interrogation on [**8-22**] revealed 2 episodes of a tach
with pacing.  One started [**7-19**] and lasted over 3 weeks.  The
other was on [**8-21**] and lasted 23 hours.  Pacemaker is dual
chamber and functioning properly.
.
6. ARF: Following creatinine.  Stable now at 1.0.
.
7. H/O atrial tach/flutter: Coumadin.  Should have INR followed
as outpatient.
.
8. FEN: Replete lytes as needed.
.
9. HTN: Metoprolol 50mg TID, lasix, spironolactone.  Maintain
SBP below 135 if possible.  Will follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1016**] 10 days.
.
10. PPX: Anticoagulated, protonix.
.
