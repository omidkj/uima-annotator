male with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung
who presented to an outside hospital with acute shortness of
breath and now with productive cough who presented to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for bronchoscopy and
similar cough and finding of a mass on chest x-ray, nodules
on CT.  On [**2175-11-16**] the patient had a biopsy done by
mediastinoscopy, which was positive for poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma.  On [**11-16**] and [**1-2**] the patient received
radiation therapy.  From [**11-16**] to [**1-3**] the
patient received chemotherapy and Taxotere and Carboplatin
and Decadron.

2.  Cholelithiasis.

MEDICATIONS:  Advair, Albuterol, Atrovent, _________ and
Robitussin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Forty pack year tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile at 97.4, 100%
nonrebreather, pulse 124, blood pressure 132/72.  He was in
mild distress without JVD.  Bilateral diffuse inspiratory and
expiratory wheezes.  He had a chest mass palpable on the
right.  He was tachy.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive clubbing.  Cranial nerves II through
XII grossly intact.

LABORATORY:  On admission the patient had a white blood cell
count of 38,000 with 85% neutrophils and 4 bands.  The
patient had 619,000 platelets.  Electrocardiogram
tachycardia, regular, normal axis and normal intervals.  No
ST T changes.  Chest x-ray from the outside hospital interval
change since [**2175-10-25**] of angio renal cells, subclavicular
adenopathy, near complete obstruction of the right main stem
bronchus, spiculated right lung nodule without mets.
Positive cholelithiasis and diverticulosis.  Chest x-ray
showed mediastinal widening without infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on the 20th and
seen by the interventional pulmonary team due to the
patient's distress, he was taken the following day after a CT
of the airway for bronchoscopy in the Operating Room.  The
patient's CT of the airway showed both main stem bronchi were
almost completely occluded and the trachea completely
collapsed on expiration in the bronchoscopy.  There was
extensive debridement done with rigid forceps at the level of
the rigid scope.  The patient received covered metal stents
one in the trachea that measured 16 by 40 mm, one in the left
main stem bronchus, which measured 14 by 40 mm and one in the
right main stem bronchus that measured 14 by 40 mm.  The
patient was admitted intubated to the MICU after rigid
bronchoscopy.  On the following day the patient had another
bronchoscopy that showed that the stents remained in place.
The patient was then extubated and returned to the floor from
the MICU.

Cardiovascular, the patient was tachycardic throughout the
stay at normal sinus rhythm.  The patient's tachycardia
decreased to around 100 over the stay with some hydration.
No further workup was attempted.

Infectious disease, the patient with acute shortness of
breath and high white count, though white blood cell count
was likely a leukopenic reaction.  The patient was started on
Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole for post obstructive pneumonia.
 The patient's white count came down on this treatment and
the patient's shortness of breath also resolved.

DISPOSITION:  Physical therapy evaluated the patient.  The
patient was found to need rehabilitation placement, so social
work at that point found rehabilitation placement for the
patient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous 24
hours, Metronidazole 500 mg po t.i.d., Salmeterol two puffs
inhaled b.i.d., Fluticasone 110 micrograms two puffs b.i.d.,
Ipratropium bromide two puffs q.i.d., Albuterol two puffs q 6
