hematochezia or any other symptoms.  She did complain of
occasional shortness of breath.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had a history of a 40 pack year
smoking history and quit five years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 99.0, pulse
81, blood pressure 137/76, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 97 percent in room air. In general, the patient
was a well-developed, well-nourished, Caucasian female in no
acute distress.  HEENT pupils equal, round, reactive to
light, anicteric, extraocular muscles intact.  Neck supple,
midline, no lymphadenopathy or tenderness.  Chest lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular
rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen soft, tender in the left lower quadrant
mostly, but evidence of diffuse tenderness.  No masses, no
organomegaly.  Rectal positive stool, guaiac positive, no
masses.  Extremities warm and well perfused, no edema,
nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count 4.4, 32
bands, hematocrit 42.7, platelets 273.  INR 1.2, PT 13.2, PTT
25.9.  ALT 17, AST 19, alkaline phosphatase 106, total
bilirubin 0.5.  Sodium 131, potassium 4.1, chloride 91,
bicarb 22, BUN 28, creatinine 0.9, glucose 140.  Calcium 9.7,
magnesium 1.7, phosphate 4.0.  Lactate 1.0.  KUB showed
dilated small bowel with positive air fluid levels.  CT
angiogram previously ordered by patient's pulmonologist showed
no evidence of pulmonary embolus, but an enlarged gallbladder.
EKG ST depressions in leads V5 to V6, biphasic T waves in V2
and V3, normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute with normal
axis.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 70 year old female with a
history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation,
breast cancer, asthma, hypothyroidism and adenocarcinoma of
the rectum, who presents with nausea and vomiting, abdominal
pain and the presence of air fluid levels on KUB.  The
admitting diagnosis was potential small bowel obstruction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  FEN/GI.  The patient was admitted to the surgery service
with the admitting diagnosis of possible small bowel
obstruction.  She was made NPO and an NG tube was placed and
IV fluids were administered.  Due to her clinical lack of
improvement the patient was taken to the operating room on
[**2112-4-12**] where she underwent exploratory laparotomy and lysis
of adhesions for high grade small bowel obstruction.  The
surgery itself was uncomplicated and she had minimal blood
loss.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by
hypotension post-op as well as congestive heart failure.  The
patient required about 10 liters of intravenous resuscitation
immediately post-op.  She subsequently developed congestive
heart failure and atrial fibrillation which were treated with
IV furosemide and IV amiodarone for rate control and she
converted to normal sinus rhythm.  She diuresed well with
furosemide, but due to her persistent respiratory distress
and increasing oxygen requirements, she was transferred to
the MICU for further, more careful monitoring.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also complicated by fever
which reached a maximum temperature of 101.8 on [**4-12**].  Blood
cultures were obtained and are negative to date.  She also
had anemia with hematocrit of 27 for which she received one
unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient's aggressive diuresis continued.  At one point
Lasix was held due to episodes of hypotension.  Again,
hypotension responded to fluids and Lasix was restarted
without incident.  The patient's oxygen was weaned down from
a nonrebreather to 1 liter at the time of this dictation.
Her diet was advanced slowly and by the time of discharge she
was passing flatus, had bowel movements, was not nauseous,
was tolerating a regular diet.

The patient had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection
fraction of 55 to 60 percent.  There was also focal right
ventricular hypokinesis with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Overall it was within normal limits.

The patient had repeat chest x-ray which showed interval
improvement in her congestive heart failure.

The patient's electrolytes were repleted as necessary.  Her
pain was well controlled with oral pain medications.  She did
develop loose stools at one point, but Clostridium difficile
toxin was negative.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Rehabilitation facility ([**Hospital 100**] Rehab
Facility).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Small bowel obstruction.
2.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
3.  Coronary artery disease.

5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Asthma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Albuterol one to two puffs q.four to six hours p.r.n.
2.  Fluticasone propionate two puffs b.i.d. p.r.n.
3.  Advair 50 mcg one puff q.12 hours p.r.n.
4.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Bisacodyl 10 mg suppository p.r.n.
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q.six hours.
10. Furosemide 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Zofran 4 mg q.four to six hours p.r.n. nausea.
