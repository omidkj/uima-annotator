Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7744**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Reason for MICU transfer: hyponatremia, hypotension, respiratory
distress

History of Present Illness:
.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 108723**] is a 67 year old female
with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus,
alcohol-related-cirrhosis, coronary artery disease with a bare
metal stent, and chronic diastolic heart failure, who is
admitted to the ICU from the ED for management of hyponatremia,
hypotension, and hypoxia.
.
She was diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonia on [**2106-8-5**]
and was on day eight of ten of a levofloxacin course. She was
referred to the ED by her PCP due to increasing fatigue and an
inability to care for herself at home.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, her vital signs were T 98.2, HR 84, BP
93/62, RR 20, saturating 90% RA. She complained of bilateral
lower extremity pain that had been going on for weeks. Her exam
was notable for crackles in the left lower field and erythema in
the right lower extremity. Her labs were notable for a sodium of
121, Chloride 86, Cr 2.6, BUN 37, proBNP of 1329 (elevated from
687 in [**2106-1-9**]), hematocrit of 31.5 (down from 34.3 in
[**2106-7-9**]), and white cells of 10.1k with 78% neutrophils. A UA
showed few bacteria, positive leuks, 7 wbc, and negative
nitrite. A repeat UA two hours later was completely neative. The
urine sodium was less than 10. A chest x-ray showed a resolving
left lower lobe opacity. Lower extremity dopplers were negative
for dvt in the right lower extremity. A CTA was contraindicated
in the setting of renal failure, and a V-Q scan was ordered.
Suspicion was high for a pulmonary embolism given the patients
prior history of pulmonary embolism; however, heparin was not
initiated because she had guaiac positive stool. She was given
one liter of normal saline, afterwhich her systolic blood
pressure improved from the low 90s to the low 100s.
.
Her vital signs upon transfer were bp 105/62, hr 62, sat 99 4L,
rr unknown, and was reported to be afebrile. She had one 18
guage peripheral iv.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**8-5**]): Left lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CXR ([**8-13**]): Improved left lower lobe opacification, with interval
development of bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung
volumes.
.
RLE U/S ([**8-13**]):  No evidence of right lower extremity deep venous
thrombus.
.
LIVER/GALLBLADDER U/S ([**8-14**]): 1. Patent hepatic vasculature. 2.
Increased echogenicity and coarseness of the liver likely
relates to underlying cirrhosis. 3. Prominent but unchanged main
pancreatic duct. 4. Mild gallbladder wall thickening, likely
related to the underlying liver
disease.
