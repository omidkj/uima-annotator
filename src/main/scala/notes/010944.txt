Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Facial swelling/Hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation [**2120-10-11**], extubation [**2120-10-13**]


History of Present Illness:
53 yo primarily Spanish speaking female with obesity
hypoventilation on home CPAP with multiple hospital admissions
for hypercarbic respiratory failure, OSA, panhypopit, pulmonary
HTN, diastolic CHF, brought in by EMS to ED with facial swelling
since this morning per daughter. [**Name (NI) **] noted tongue swelling or
difficulty speaking or swallowing. Old notes mention hx of
angioedema [**3-2**] ACEI. No new meds, not currently on an ACEI - but
has been on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].

In the ED, on triage, T99.2, HR 98, BP 115/56, 92% on home 2L.
For the facial swelling, she received IV benadryl, IV
solumedrol, and pepcid and facial edema improved. ABG on 4L was
7.32/77/65. Patient's baseline PCO2 is in the 60s. Patient
initially was alert, but within 45 minutes, patient was opening
eyes, following commands but nonverbal. Patient was wheezing on
exam, received nebs. Repeat vitals were HR70, BP107/59, RR 16-18
on BIPAP. Repeat ABG was 7.3/82/55 and noted to have wheezing on
exam. Patient intubated in ED. Tube was too far down on xray and
was pulled back. Both legs looked red, tense to knees, so
received vanc/unasyn for cellulitis coverage. In ED, received 2L
fluid, was stopped when repeat CXR showed pulmonary edema.

[**10-11**] CXR: Final Report
SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.

HISTORY: 53-year-old woman with facial swelling and hypercarbia.
Evaluate
for acute cardiopulmonary process.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest x-rays, most recently
[**2120-8-23**], dating back
to [**2116-1-21**].

FINDINGS: A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
was obtained.
Given differences in technique, findings are not significantly
changed in
comparison to [**2120-8-23**]. The cardiac silhouette remains
massively enlarged.
Interstitial prominence and indistinctness of the pulmonary
vessels suggests a
degree of interstitial edema. No new airspace consolidation or
large effusion
is identified on this single portable view.

IMPRESSION: Stable findings of interstitial edema and
cardiomegaly.
.
[**10-15**] CXR: Final Report
HISTORY: COPD and fever.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-14**], there is again
substantial
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bibasilar opacities
consistent with
atelectasis. Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggests
pleural fluid.
Mild vascular engorgement persists.

IMPRESSION: Little overall change.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Facial Edema:
Initial concern for angioedema in ED given h/o similar reaction
to Ace-I, and currently taking [**Last Name (un) **]. She received IV benadryl, IV
solumedrol, and facial edema improved. However, patient also on
chronic steroids and thought maybe to have cushingoid facie with
volume overload from CHF. [**Last Name (un) **] was restarted in ICU without
evidence of anaphlactic reaction throughout the rest of her
hospital course.

#Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
Patient is chronically hypercarbic in the 60s due to chronic
obstructive sleep apnea/obesity hypoventilation syndome. In the
ED, patient noted to be wheezing. ABG on 4L was 7.32/77/65,
repeat ABG was 7.3/82/55, patient was then intubated for airway
protection for possibly impending obstruction [**3-2**] edema. Pt was
difficult intubation because of inflammation; got 3 doses of
steroids. On arrival to the ICU, the patient was weaned on a
PEEP of 8, FiO2 of 100. Was extubated on ICU day 2 and
stabilized on CPAP at night and 3L 02 via NC during the day.
She was seen by physical therapy and abulatory stats were >90%
on 3L02

#Bacterial Pneumonia:
Patient had low grade fevers and leukocytosis in the ICU, CXR
was concerning for PNA. MSSA was cultured from sputum. She
received 3 days of IV Nafcillin and was transitioned to PO
Dicloxacillin (total 7 day course, last day [**10-19**]). We considered
levofloxacin but her QTc was slightly prolonged so we avoided
it. She remained afebrile and leukocytosis resolved.

#Obesity Hypoventilation/Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
Chronic, causing hypercarbia. Once extubated was placed on CPAP
nightly and 3L 02 via NC . Did not keep last appointment with
outpatient sleep lab. We set up patient with close follow up for
sleep and weight management

#Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:
Grade 2, EF >55%. Was diuresed with 20IV lasix daily in the ICU.
 Not diuresed on the floor given concern that hypernatremia was
due to diuresis and poor po intake/no IVF.

#Acute blood loss Anemia from gastritis:
Guaiac positive emesis in the ICU likely Likely [**3-2**] high dose
steroids given in ED. Was given PO PPI, HCT increasing, not
tachycardic or hypotensive.

#Hypernatremia:
Patient without IVF or PO for several days, receiving diuretics,
BUN:Cr ratio indicative of pre-renal azotemia. Likely
hypovolemic hypernatremia. Should resolve now that patient is
taking in good PO.

#Metabolic Alkalosis:
Likely compensatory for respiratory ac
