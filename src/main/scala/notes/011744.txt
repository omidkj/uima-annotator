intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old feamle with PMH of COPD on home O2 of 3L
NC, HTN, CHF, IDDM, PVD with stents to bilateral legs, recently
diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma one year ago and recently found to
have mets to the liver presenting with progressive shortness of
breath requiring non-invasive ventilation at OSH and was
intubated to protect her airway and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
stenting of the right bronchus intermedius as a means to
potentially improve her baseline shortness of breath. She was
initially admitted to OSH on [**10-9**] with weakness, dyspnea, and
cough. She was started on levofloxacin and seen  by pulmonary
for the suspicion that her symptoms are caused by  an
obstructive process as a result of the mass.

Imaging:

CT head [**2158-10-19**]: No acute intracranial abnormality. No evidence
of intra or extra-axial lesion in this non-contrast study.

LENIs [**2158-10-18**]: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.

CXR [**2158-10-18**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the most
lateral right aspect of the right hemithorax is missing. With
this limitation in mind, there is no relevant difference as
compared to the previous examination. The monitoring and support
devices are in unchanged position. No evidence of complication,
notably no pneumothorax. Unchanged moderate right hilar
enlargement, with relatively diffuse and many peripheral right
parenchymal opacities. The extent of the pre-existing right
pleural effusion cannot be determined given that it is not
visualized. No abnormality is seen in the left lung. Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette.

CT chest w/o contrast [**2158-10-15**]: 1. Large infiltrating right hilar
mass occluding the bronchus intermedius and portions of the
right middle lobe and right lower lobe proximal bronchi. There
is extensive mediastinal adenopathy including a large precarinal
node, which may be contiguous with the dominant hilar mass.
Several suspicious spiculated satellite nodules are also noted
within the right middle and right lower lobe with additional
suspicious left lower lobe nodule. Superimposed presumed
post-obstructive bronchiolitis is seen in the right upper, right
middle and right lower lobes. Known underlying centrilobular
emphysema.

2. Large hypoattenuating right hepatic lesion presumably site of
biopsy-
proven metastases. Several subcutaneous soft tissue nodules are
present which is an atypical location for lung metastases. A
concomitant second malignancy such as melanoma is not excluded.
Several of these lesions are not located at sites typically used
for subcutaneous injections.

3. Small right pleural effusion and trace perihepatic ascites.

4. Atherosclerotic disease including coronary artery
calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 73953**] was a 76 year old woman with PMH of COPD on home O2
of 3L NC, HTN, CHF, IDDM, PVD with stents to bilateral legs,
recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with mets to the liver
who presented with progressive shortness of breath requiring
non-invasive ventilation at OSH and was intubated to protect her
airway and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of the right
bronchus intermedius as a means to potentially improve her
baseline shortness of breath.
.
Respiratory failure: The patient had progressive shortness of
breath that required noninvasive ventilation at OSH. She was
electively intubated to protect her airway prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Her repiratory failure was in large part secondary to
collapsed airway secondary to obstruction by her NSCLC.  LENIs
were negative.  Nebulizers were continued.  Theophylline was
held.
.
Lung cancer with airway obstruction:  IP was consulted on
admission.  Review of CT from 2 weeks prior demonstrated
near-complete collapse of bronchus intermedius.  IP performed
bedside bronchoscopy via her ET tube and found now complete
collapse.  Because of the anatomy of her occlusion, stenting was
not possible. She received the first of 2 palliative radiation
treatments without improvement in her respiratory status.  Due
to progressive oxygen requirements and poor prognosis, decision
was made with her husband and children to change focus of care
to comfort.  She was extubated the morning of [**2158-10-21**] in the
company of her extended family.  She was given a morphine drip
and passed away at 11:10am.  Family denied autopsy.  Admitting
notified.  [**Location (un) 511**] organ bank was notified prior to
extubation and, but unfortunately patient was not a candidate
due to her malignancy and active post-obstructive pneumonia.
