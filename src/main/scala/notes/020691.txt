Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**]
Chief Complaint:
b/l lower leg weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50yo female with metastatic cecal
adenocarcinoma and recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 16125**] for
heaviness in legs now presenting with several days of weakness
and tingling of bilateral legs. Pt had home PT today but her
physical therapist sent her to the ED as she was unable to
participate in exercises. Additionally pt had a fall from bed
today without LOC or head strike.

Pt's recent admission was for a similar presentation and s/p
mechanical fall on stairs thought to be multifactorial due to
dehydration and deconditioning and she was sent home with home
PT.  Pt reports that she continues to have "no mobility" in her
legs, having trouble getting up to go to the bathroom. She
denies any pain in her legs but does report "tingling"
everywhere in her legs with some subjective knee swelling.
Prior to leaving the hospital yesterday, pt reports that she was
able to walk with a walker and is now unable to do so.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.8 100 150/81 20 97%RA. While in
the [**Name (NI) **] pt had oral temp to 103 and rectal temp to 104.8+. In the
[**Name (NI) **], pt received zofran, ceftriaxone 1g IV, tylenol PR and 3L NS.
 Labs were notable for Hct 27.9, D-dimer 3669, and lactate 3.2.
CT-PE protocol showed pulmonary involving all lobar pulmonary
arteries (RU, RM, RL, [**Doctor Last Name **], LL, lingular). Additionally, bowing of
right ventricle suggestive of right heart strain and moderate
bilateral pleural effusions (R>L). CT Head showed no evidence of
metastasis or intracranial process.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. were T983., P134, BP
123/84, R23, 95%RA. Pt soon had fever to 101.2. She had no
complaints other than continued tingling and weakness of her
legs and thirst. No pain or SOB.

Imaging:
[**2157-7-13**] CTA   1. Massive pulmonary emboli involving all lobar
pulmonary arteries. Bowing of right ventricle suggests right
heart strain.
2. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis. Size of
effusions has improved since [**5-18**], [**2156**].
3. Multiple hepatic hypodense metastases, similar to [**2157-5-18**].

[**2157-7-13**] Head CT w/o contrast
1.  No acute intracranial process.
2.  No CT evidence of large intracranial mass.  However, for
evaluation of
subtle metastases, gadolinium-enhanced MRI is superior.
3.  Redemonstration of post-surgical changes in the left
anterior ethmoidal sinus and orbit, with persistent expansile
soft tissue in the left anterior ethmoidal region.  Recommend
correlation with prior imaging and clinical history if available
and possible MRI evaluation as previously suggested.

[**7-13**] Echo
Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension

[**7-14**] MRI spine
1.  No evidence of bony metastasis in the cervical, thoracic or
lumbar region.
2.  No evidence of cord compression or an obvious intraspinal
mass.
3.  Gadolinium-enhanced images were not obtained which although
slightly limit evaluation for a mass, no large intraspinal mass
identified.  No abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
4.  Bilateral pleural effusions and small amount of fluid in the
pelvis.

[**7-14**] LENIs - No evidence of DVT

Brief Course:
50 yo female with PMH notable for metastatic cecal
adenocarcinoma now admitted with many pulmonary emboli and right
heart strain along with concerning neurologic exam.

Active Issues
===================
# Pulmonary emboli: Pt with many risk factors for PE including
metastatic cancer, recent hospitalization, and deconditioning.
She was started on heparin gtt and transitioned to lovenox.
LENIs were negative for DVT.  With no evidence of clot burden in
her legs, she was not believed to be a candidate for IVC filter
placement.
Echo revealed Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. Pt will be discharged on lovenox.

# Abnormal LE sensation/weakness thought secondary to conversion
d/o: Pt reports new onset bilateral weakness, tingling and found
to have weakness and diminished sensation on exam. Concern for
metastases compressing spinal canal or nerve roots. MRI and CT
of spine revealed no cord compression. Neurology was consulted
and recommended EMG, which was normal. Neuro exam was
inconsistent during hospital stay, so thought to be component of
somatization. There was discussion of obtaining CT abd to
evaluate the lumbar plexus, but neuro and radiology determined
little utility in obtaining scan. Psych was consulted and
believed pt fit criteria for conversion disorder. Physical
therapy was consulted and recommended rehab.

# Fevers: High fevers in this asymptomatic patient may be due to
her significant clot burden and underlying malignancy. No
evidence of occult infection by history, exam or chest imaging.
Urine cultures were negative. Blood cultures were negative.
Afebrile >7days at time of discharge.

# Anemia: Recent slow downward trend in Hct starting in [**Month (only) **]
from baseline of 36. Possibly due to chemotherapy. [**Month (only) 116**] have some
component of anemia of chronic disease. Patient was guaiac
positive. Pt transfused with 2 units PRBCs on [**7-16**], 1u PRBCs
[**7-25**].

# Low UOP: Pt with low UOP during course of admission secondary
to poor PO intake. UOP improved. Creatinine remained normal.
Renal U/S normal.

# Diarrhea: C diff negative, stool culture
