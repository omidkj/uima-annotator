His primary care physician is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1683**].  His pulmonologist
is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2146**].

In the Emergency Department, patient was started on
levofloxacin because of concern for pneumonia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, this is a 70-year-old male
who was speaking in brief phrases and has some diaphoresis.
Vital signs:  Temperature of 100.5.  Heart rate in the 140s.
Blood pressure 120/70.  02 saturation is 95% on five liters.
Head is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light with extraocular motions intact.  There are
dry mucous membranes.  There is no jugular venous distention.
Oropharynx is clear but dry.  The neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy.  Lung exam demonstrates diffuse rales with
egophony.  There is bibasilar dullness to percussion, left
greater than right.  Heart is tachycardic S1, S2, no S3.
Abdomen is soft, obese, nondistended with a Foley in the
bladder.  Extremities:  There is no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Rectal:  Heme negative stool.

Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 110 beats per
minute with a left axis deviation and T wave inversions in
lead III.

Chest x-ray demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions with
left side greater than the right.  There are also increased
ovular opacities, possible pneumonia or congestive heart
failure.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count is 24, hematocrit 41.6,
platelets 245,000.  Differential for the white blood cell
count has 92% neutrophils, 5% bands, 1% lymphocytes, 2%
monocytes.  Sodium of 134, potassium 4.5, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 23, BUN 24, creatinine 1.6, glucose 138.
Arterial blood gases on five liters:  pH of 7.32, a c02 of 46
and an 02 of 72, lactate is 1.7, potassium was 4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By systems:

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  An echocardiogram demonstrated no
systolic dysfunction.  Given need for oxygen and no systolic
dysfunction on echocardiogram, diastolic congestive heart
failure was suspected.

2.  Pulmonary:  On the evening of admission, patient was
becoming more diaphoretic and short of breath.  Serial
arterial blood gases demonstrated increasing acidosis and
hypercarbia, therefore, requiring a transfer to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**3-22**] for respiratory distress and
acidosis.  The patient was placed on BiPAP and given
Solu-Medrol.  The patient did well with BiPAP over two days
and patient's respiratory distress resolved.  Chest CT
demonstrated pleural thickening with nodular characteristics
and question of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Patient was
continued on Levaquin that was started in the Emergency
Department for possible pneumonia.  On [**3-24**], patient was
transferred back to the floor where his right pleural
effusion was tapped.  On [**3-25**], the left pleural effusion
was also tapped at the recommendation of the Pulmonary
consult.  The etiology of the pulmonary effusions was
unclear, but the differential diagnoses included malignancy,
rheumatoid lung and pneumonia.  The fluid was sent for
multiple studies.  The etiology of the effusions remained
unclear.

On [**3-30**], patient received a thoracoscopy by
Interventional Pulmonology for a biopsy of the lungs.  The
patient was scheduled to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13907**], who is
the Pulmonologist, and also Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who performed the lung
biopsy.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  Given the history of black stools,
patient's serial hematocrits were followed.  There was no
drop in the hematocrit throughout the admission.  Patient was
scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy for work-up of a
possible gastrointestinal malignancy.  Given suspicion of
rheumatoid lung based on the Pulmonary consult
recommendation, a Rheumatology consult was obtained.

4.  Rheumatology:  Multiple laboratory tests were performed
including [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] which was negative, rheumatoid factor which
was also negative.  A CRP level was 19.5.  ESR level was
elevated at 105.  Multiple protein immunoelectrophoresis
laboratories were performed which demonstrated an elevated
IgG level at 3058, but normal IgA, IgM levels.  The patient
also had complements drawn.  C3 was normal.  C4 was low and
HCV antibody was negative.  Patient was negative for
legionella.   Adenosine deaminase level was known to be
elevated from [**9-23**].  All blood cultures and pleural
fluid cultures were negative.  Cytology was also negative.
Rheumatology suspected that a rheumatoid lung was less likely
given that patient had no evidence for inflammatory arthritis
by x-ray examination of extremities.  Patient was scheduled
for a Rheumatology follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

5.  Renal:  Patient's creatinine was elevated from 1.4 to 1.6
but recovered with fluid hydration.  Creatinine was back to
baseline at 1.4.  Patient was suspected of dehydration
because of low sodium level, a urine osmolalities greater
than 100 and urine sodium was approximately 20 to 30.
Patient also had decreased skin turgor.  Patient did well
with fluid hydration.

DISPOSITION:  Patient was to follow-up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 13907**].  His Pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
the Rheumatologist, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who performed the lung
biopsy.
