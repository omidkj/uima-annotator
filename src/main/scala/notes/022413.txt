Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
palpitations, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-18**] redo sternotomy/ AVR (#23 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9041**]), CABG x 1
(SVG->PDA)


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80 y/o M hx MI s/p CABG, extensive cardiac history
(read below in PMHx), severe AS (h/o syncope), DM, HTN, and
Hyperlipidemia who presents today to ED with palpitations, CP
and SOB and found to have Afib w/ RVR.
.
At baseline, patient is able to walk up 6 stairs and has to stop
due to SOB. He has ? gastroenteritis for the last few days.
Today, he was unable to climb any steps as he felt lousy
intially. Then he developed severe [**10-25**] pounding chest pain
which was associated with SOB and sweating. He did not have any
dizziness or syncope with that. He called EMS and enroute, he
was found to have AFib w/ RVR and was given bolus of Amio IVB
without any effect.
.
Upon arrival in the ED, his HR was > 160, BP was 100-120/70-90,
RR 30. He then received 10 mg IV Dilt -> BP dropped to 84/74
without any effect on the HR. He was then electrically
cardioverted to sinus rhythm. Subsequently his vitals were
stable at around 101, 127/80, 28, 100%/NRB. He also received 4.5
lts of NS. He also had some ST depressions in the inferolateral
leads in the setting of tachycardia and so he was started on
heparin. He also got 2.5 IV lopressor to which he dropped his
SBP from 125 to 70 which reverted back to his baseline of around
120 within few minutes. He was also given Levaquin 500 mg IV for
UTI.
.

Physical Exam:
VS: 95.2, 100, 107/74, 21, 100%/NRB
Gen: appears comfortable, mild conversational dyspnea
HEENT: PERLA, EOMI, Dry MM
Neck: distended neck veins, JVD ~ [**7-23**] cms
Heart: tachycardia, regular rhythm, distant heart sounds, could
not appreciate any murmur
Lungs: mild expiratory wheezing, crackles at bases bilaterally
Abd: distended, tympanic, bowel sounds normoactive, soft/NT
Ext: 1+ edema bilaterally, changes from venous statis on right,
resolving cellulitic changes on left

Pulses:
Right: Carotid 1+ Femoral 1+ Popliteal 1+ DP 1+ PT 1+
Left: Carotid 1+ Femoral 1+ Popliteal 1+ DP 1+ PT 1+


Pertinent Results:
[**2169-4-14**] CArotid Duplex Ultrasound
1. Occluded left internal carotid artery.
2. No significant right ICA or CCA stenosis (right ICA stenosis
is graded as less than 40%).

[**2169-4-15**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anterior and
infero-lateral hypokinesis (?multi-vessel CAD?). Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is at least
moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-2-24**],
there are new
regional wall motion abnormalities c/w multi-vessel CAD. The
degree of aortic stenosis (moderate to severe) is probably
similar (currently lower gradient probably secondary to
decreased cardiac output).

[**2169-4-17**] Vein Mapping
There is a patent right greater saphenous vein, however, there
is reflux throughout and varicosities below the knee. There are
patent bilateral lesser saphenous veins of small diameter and
the left greater saphenous vein is only visualized at the
saphenofemoral junction and not seen throughout the rest of the
leg.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2169-4-14**] for further
evaluation of his aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
He was evaluated by the cardiac surgical service given that a
recent cardiac catheterization revealed occluded vein grafts
from his prior CABG in [**2158**]. Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] was worked up in the
usual preoperative manner. A carotid duplex ultrasound was
performed which revealed an occluded left internal carotid
artery and mild plaque in the right internal carotid artery.
Ciprofloxacin was started for a urinary tract infection. Vein
mapping was performed which revealed a patent right saphenous
vein with dimensions ranging between 3.7mm to 6.7mm. On [**2169-4-18**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
redo sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting to one
vessel and an aortic valve replacement using a 23mm [**Known lastname 9041**]
Porcine Valve. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. Pressors were
continued to maintain an acceptable blood pressure. Gentle
diuresis was initiated. On postoperative day three, Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. Amiodarone was
started for atrial fibrillation.

On postoperative day five, Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. Haldol was used for periods of
postoperative delirium. As his diet improved and advanced, his
oral diabetes medications were resumed. Foley was reinserted for
urinary retention on POD #7. Mental status much improved on POD
#9 and haldol discontinued. C. diff. culture sent for diarrhea
amd was negative twice.  He was discharged to rehab on POD#10 in
stable condition.
