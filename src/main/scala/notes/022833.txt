Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
ST elevation and elevated tropinin

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. percutaneous coronary intervention
2. right femoral and popliteal embolectomy

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old woman with severe COPD, recent admit to
[**Hospital1 46**] with diverticulitis vs. ischemic colitis from [**Date range (1) 65244**]
- treated with abx. Patient currently residing at NH when noted
to be severely diaphoretic and ??????not feeling well??????, nursing there
thought she looked SOB. No chest pain. Sats in the field were
76% on room air although her extremities were very cold. Upon
arrival to OSH ER after warmed up, sats 89% on room air. No
evidence of CHF on CXR. Upon arrival to ER- HR 130??????s Sinus tach
with ST elevation V1-V3. Slowed her down with a total of 20mg of
IV diltiazem and HR now 90??????s. Even with better rate control, ST
elevation persisted --> [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab. Cath showed 70% mid-diag
stenosis (not intervened upon), dyskinetic inf apical segment
and ballooning with preserved basal segment consistent with
Takatsubos. Post-cath, patient RLE pulses were non-dopplerable,
mottled. Taken to OR with SFA and Popliteal thrombectomy now on
heparin drip. Intubated in OR, now extubated 97% 2L NC.
Overnight in PACU, became hypotensive, started on levophed drip,
now off. Continued to be tachycardic tried on esmolol drip ->
hypotn -> stopped. Admitted to CCU [**2102-1-6**] for further care.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2102-1-17**] 7:19 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Decreased mild pulmonary edema.
2. Moderate, bilateral pleural effusion, right decreased, left
stable.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2102-1-12**] 8:41 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Volume overload, as evidenced by bilateral pleural effusions,
small amount of abdominal free fluid, anasarca, and intralobular
septal thickening in the lungs.
2. Segmental lung collapse/atelectasis, and superimposed
infection cannot be excluded in the right lower lobe.
3. No evidence of hemorrhage within the thoracic, abdominal, or
pelvic cavities accounting for the hematocrit drop.

ECHO [**2102-1-9**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The apex is
not fully visualized but no wall motion abnormality is
visualized. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2102-1-5**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patient revealed one vessel CAD.  The LMCA, LCX and RCA were all

angiographically without flow limiting disease.  The LAD was
also
without significant disease but there was a 70% lesion in a mid
diagonal.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mild elevation of right sided
filling
pressures with mean RA of 11mmHG.  There was mild elevation of
PCWP and
LVEDP at 18mmHG as well as mild pulmonary hypertension with mean
PA of
26mmHG. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.65.  There was no
trans-aortic gradient.
3.  Ventriculography was slightly limited by VT during injection
but it
did show apical ballooning with preserved basal segments
consistent with
possible Takotsubo or stress induced cardiomyopathy.  The
overall EF was
40-45%.
4.  Post cath patient was found to have pulseless right leg.
She was
transferred to vascular surgery for emergent surgery.
  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel CAD in a branch vessel (diagonal)
2. Cardiomyopathy with apical ballooning
3. Mild elevation of left and right sided filling pressures with

preserved cardiac index.
4. Procedure complicated by pulseless foot post cath.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 yof h/o COPD, HTN p/w Takatsobu's cardiomyopathy
s/p right femoral and popliteal thrombectomy. [**Hospital **] hospital
course of complicated by hypercarbic respiratory distress likely
[**3-2**] pneumonia in setting of severe COPD requiring intubation on
[**1-11**]. Sputum culture grew MRSA and urine culture grew Proteus
mirabilis. Patient was subsequently placed on vanco and zosyn,
respectively. Of note, patient also grew coag negative staph in
1 out of 4 bld cx bottles. Upon extubation, patient requested to
be DNI. Unfortunately, patient did not tolerate extubation
despite noninvasive support.  She passed away the evening of
[**2102-1-18**] [**3-2**] respiratory failure.
.
#Elevated WBC: Unclear etiology of her white count, may be from
MRSA pneumonia, Proteus UTI, also pt with recent h/o ischemic
colitis vs diverticulitis. Patient was switched from zosyn to
ceftriaxone and then switched back to zosyn [**3-2**] increased WBC.
Patient continued on IV vanc. Pan cultured, sent stool cx
including c diff which were negative and dc central line (sent
tip for culture which was negative).
.
#COPD/O2 requirement: Was likely due to a combination of
retention [**3-2**] from oxygenation, COPD,
chronic disease with poor lung reserve. CXR and chest CT
suggested pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, could not
exclude RLL pneumonia. Patient completed a 5 day course of
azithromycin. Patient was on IV vancomycin for MRSA pna and IV
zosyn with decreased secretions and white count. Repeat CXR
decreased pulm edema with persistent bilateral pleural
effusions. Due to improved respiratory status, decreased
secretions, awake/alertness and RISBI<100, patient was extubated
on [**1-18**] however required CPAP [**3-2**] hypoxia on nonrebreather.
Despite CPAP, patient was in hypercarbic respiratory distress.
.
#CARDIAC
ischemia: EKG w/ST elevations consistent with Takatsobu
cardiomyopathy v ACS. On cath, patient was found to have minor
CAD (70% mid-diag stenosis). She was continued on ASA,
lisinopril 10 and nifedipine 10. Workup for stressor/trigger of
Takatsobu included rechecking UA, metanephrines urine and
plasma, TSH and c diff. Urine metanephrines were pending. Free
normetanephrine were wnl and not suggestive of pheo. UA was
negative and c diff was negative x1.
