Pertinent Results:
Intra-op Echo
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. There is
moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST CPB:
1. Unchanged LV and RV function (EF=30-35%) with epinephrine
infusion.
2. Annuloplasty ring in m itral position. Well seated and
stable. Good leaflet excursion (PG = 7 mm HG/MG= 4 mmHg). MVA by
PHT = 2.5 cm 2
3. Intact aorta.
4. No othjer change.
