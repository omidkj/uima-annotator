Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft times two, diabetes mellitus, with DDD
and AICD placement, history of cardiac arrest, history of
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, mechanical mitral valve,
chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and
recent [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] admission from [**12-28**] to [**1-8**] for decompensated
congestive heart failure was readmitted from [**Hospital3 39496**] with question unresponsive episode and clots at
rehab.  He has no memory of the event and recalls waking up
last p.m. at [**Hospital3 24768**] with an increase in pain and
rapid swelling of his increased right lower extremity.  His
prior admission course was notable for a fall two day, status
post catheterization with resultant right groin hematoma.
Initially a 2 by 1 cm pseudoaneurysm was seen at the right
groin, but repeat ultrasound was negative for such.  The
patient discharged to rehab and had persistent mild right
groin pain at rehab and no swelling.  Right lower extremity
swelling acutely worsened the day of admission and hematocrit
dropped to 21, was 31.  Transfused 1 unit of packed red blood
cells at [**Hospital3 24768**] prior to transfer.  INR was 4.0
for mechanical valve.  Course at [**Hospital3 24768**]
complicated by hypoglycemia to 30 by report and acute on
chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR and hyperkalemia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times two,
diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive
heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, mechanical valve,
status post V fibrillation arrest.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 200 b.i.d.
2.  Protonix.
3.  Aspirin.
4.  Quinapril 20.
5.  Lipitor.
6.  Coumadin.
7.  Lasix 80 once a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He quit smoking twenty years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs 97.7.  Pulse
72.  Blood pressure 118/58.  18, 98% on room air.  He is an
elderly man in no acute distress, lying in bed.  His heart
had a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  He had
a positive 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border with mechanical heart sounds heard best at the
apex.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with a positive
reducible, nontender hernia in the right mid abdominal. His
groin he had bilateral femoral bruits, 2+ femoral pulses
bilaterally and extensive hematoma with tense involving the
right medial thigh.  Ecchymosis and hematoma extended to the
midline to involve the left groin.  He had 2+ pitting edema
of right lower extremity to knee, right thigh much larger
then left.  He had trace pitting left lower extremity edema.
Full range of motion on the left, but right lower extremity
is limited at the hip and knee by pain.  He had dopplerable
dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally.  His neurological examination was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was monitored in the Coronary Care Unit
and transfused packed red blood cells.  His Coumadin was
initially held, however, then he was placed on a heparin
drip, because of a subtherapeutic INR given his mitral valve.
He was evaluated by vascular surgery who determined that his
hematoma was thus stable and no intervention was needed to
evacuate.  His hematocrit remained stable and he was
transferred out of the unit to the floor.  His hospital
course was complicated by acute renal failure thought to be
secondary to initial hypotension event.  His Lasix was
originally held and monitored for improvement of his kidney
function.  When his creatinine became stable and his hematoma
was determined stable he was resumed on his Coumadin and he
remained in house until his Coumadin became of therapeutic
range.  His Lasix and ace inhibitor were held.  His
creatinine trended down to baseline prior to discharge.  He
was discharged to rehab.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 7.5.
2.  Metoprolol 50 b.i.d.
3.  Ambien prn.
4.  Glipizide XL 10.
5.  Atorvastatin 10.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg.
7.  Amiodarone 200 twice a day.
8.  Sliding scale insulin.
9.  Protonix.
10.  Colace.

His Lasix and ace inhibitor will resume once his function
stabilized as an outpatient.
