History of Present Illness:
HPI and Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2405**] is a 59 yo M w/ PMH
Left renal cell carcinoma s/p resection 8 [**Last Name (un) **] w/ recurrence in
the gallbladder and possibly a second right renal primary who
started high dose IL-2 therapy on [**2137-3-25**]. He tolerated [**1-24**]
doses with minimal complications. He finished his last dose at 3
pm on [**3-29**]. As of [**3-29**] he was positive 3 Liters. On the day of
[**3-30**], he was more confused and agitated trying to pull out his
lines. He was also noted to be more short of breath. A CXR was
notable for low lung volumes contributing to increased IS and
vascular markings. He was given 20 IV lasix with ~200 cc UO. At
5:30 pm, he continued to be short of breath. His sats were noted
to be 80% NRB. A Code Blue was called. ABG was 7.06/83/119/25.
Multiple attempts were made at intubation without success. After
one intubation his HR was noted to be in the 30s so he was given
1 dose of atropine with an increase in his heart rate to 150s
afib w/ rvr. The surgery team was called and multiple attempts
were made at a surgical airway without definite success.
Eventually anesthesia felt they had an oral airway and his sats
increased to high 80s with bagging. A femoral A line was placed.
He received 40 mg Lasix IV w/ ~200-300 cc UO. The course was
also complicated by persistent hypotension requiring dopamine
and neosynephrine and continued afib w/ RVR with rates
120s-180s. He was then taken to the OR for EGD and bronchoscopy.
In the OR, he underwent neck exploration, bronchoscopy, repair
of laryngeal laceration and EGD. His superior airway was noted
to be edematous.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was intubated, sedated.
.
Past ONC Hx: Mr. [**Known lastname 2405**] was diagnosed with left renal cell
carcinoma approximately 8 years ago. He reportedly underwent
nephrectomy revealing a T2 renal cell carcinoma.  He was well
until approximately [**6-15**], when he developed chest pain and
difficulty swallowing with endoscopy revealing oral candidiasis.
Approximately 6 months later, he underwent repeat endoscopy with
stomach biopsy showing a lymphoid infiltrate. The presence of
the gastric lymphoid infiltrate lead to a CT scan which revealed
a 10 x 10 mm lesion in the gallbladder fundus. He underwent
cholecystectomy on [**2136-6-21**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital1 **].
Pathology revealed metastatic clear cell carcinoma involving the
gallbladder consistent with metastasis from renal primary.
Restaging CTs on [**2136-6-27**], revealed indeterminant tiny 2 to 3
mm nodules in the right subpleural lung, a 1.8 cm mass in the
right kidney, 2 subcentimeter perinephric nodules, and 3
perisigmoid nodules. On follow-up CTs, the right kidney mass was
stable and felt to be a 2nd primary. In [**2-17**], CT abd was notable
for enlarging LN near the uncinate process. On [**2137-3-25**], he was
admitted to start high dose IL-2 therapy. He received [**1-24**]
doses as of [**2138-1-26**].

Echo: Conclusions:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process
(primary pulmonary hypertension, chronic pulmonary embolism,
COPD, etc.).

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: 59 yo M w/ metastatic renal cell carcinoma s/p
dose 12/14 of IL-2 at 3pm on [**3-29**] with acute onset of hypoxia
and hypotension transferred to unit with respiratory code.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure - Most likely due to pulmonary
edema/ capillary leak in the setting of the pt receiving IL-2
and being 3-4L positive. CT showed multifocal pna and loculated
parapneumonic effusion, positive for exudate. Chest tube placed
and pulled the day before leaving the ICU. Patient was trached.
Bronchoscopy done before discharge showed good repair. Since the
patient was satting mid 90s on room air the trach was capped.
Patient found to have serratia and proteus pneumonia and was
treated for 7 days with aztreonam, 7 days of ceftriaxone. On [**4-12**]
his sputum cx showed sparse growth of serratia which was
pan-sensitive. Patient was put on levaquin for another w
