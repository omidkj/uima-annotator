Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 598**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, BRBPR


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
exlap, tumor and small bowel resection


History of Present Illness:
77F with PMH significant for previous endometriosis and benign
tumor removed from uterus, who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] ED with GI
bleeding and BRBPR.  On the day of presentation, she felt
fatigued and lightheaded like she was going to syncopize.  She
also felt increased abdominal pain and bloating.  Upon going to
the bathroom, she noticed a large amount of bright red blood in
the toilet bowel.  She called her PCP and was told to go to the
[**Location (un) 620**] ED.  There, her initial Hct was 22.8.  She received 3
units of packed red blood cells and her Hct came up to 31.2, but
then dropped to 26.1.  Overnight she was prepped for colonoscopy
with a GoLYTELY, but threw most of it up, so spent another day
prepping.  She still had continuous bleeding through her [**Location (un) 1662**].
She underwent a colonoscopy on the day of transfer showing
continuous bleeding potentially above the ileocecal valve, but
was not well-visualized.  She had a CTA of the abdomen that
showed a uterine mass that could be eroding into the intestinal
wall.  Patient was transferred here for potential hysterectomy
and surgical repair of her small intestine.
Of note, patient states she has been feeling more fatigued for
the past 3-4 months, and has been worked up by both her PCP here
and in [**State 108**] for anemia.  Her [**Hospital1 18**] notes on anemia do not
mention guaiac or GI bleeding.  Of the past few weeks, she has
also experienced more abdominal distention and pain, which she
attributed to weight gain.  The patient's last pelvic exam was
by a gynecologist in [**State 108**] in [**2185-1-29**] and was normal per
the patient.
.
In the ICU, her initial vitals on transfer were T 98.6 HR86
BP133/97 HR17 O2sat 100(RA).  She denied shortness of breath,
chest pain, or abdominal pain.  No dizziness, confusion, does
not feel like she's about to faint again.  She is on a bed pan
and still bleeding a little.

Imaging:

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:
ABDOMEN:  There are several subcentimeter hypodense lesions in
both
lobes of the liver.  These are too small to accurately
characterize by
CT.  The left hepatic duct and common hepatic and common bile
duct are
moderately dilated down to the level of the sphincter of Oddi.
No
obstructing lesion is identified.  The patient is status post
cholecystectomy.  The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are
unremarkable.  There are bilateral circumscribed hypodense
lesions in the kidneys consistent with cysts.  Almost all of
these are too small
to accurately characterize by CT.  No lymphadenopathy is
apparent.
PELVIS:  The uterus is markedly enlarged and has an irregular
lobulated contour.  Its density is very inhomogeneous.  Overall,
it
measures 17.2 cm longitudinal x 10.4 cm transverse x 9.5 cm AP.
Endometrium is not delineated.  There is a short segment of
small
bowel abutting the uterine fundus that demonstrates some
ill-defined
hyperemia or active bleeding.  A cluster of numerous surgical
clips
in the right pelvic adnexa.  The bladder is distended.  No
lymphadenopathy is apparent.  The ureters are mildly prominent.

Abdominal and pelvic wall structures are intact.  No osteolytic
or
osteoblastic lesion is noted.
IMPRESSION:
ABNORMAL ENLARGED UTERUS AS DESCRIBED.  FINDINGS ARE SUSPICIOUS
FOR
MALIGNANT NEOPLASM SUCH AS LEIOMYOSARCOMA OR ENDOMETRIAL
CARCINOMA.
THERE IS AN ADJACENT SHORT LOOP OF ABNORMAL SMALL BOWEL.  ITS
ENHANCEMENT SUGGESTS POSSIBLE INVASION BY TUMOR AND THERE [**Month (only) **] BE
ACTIVE BLEEDING AT THIS SITE.
.
MRI Pelvis w/ and w/o contrast: Large, heterogeneously
enhancing, multilobulated mass within the pelvis, with central
areas of necrosis and focal hemorrhage. Given its large size,
its relationship to adjacent structures is difficult to discern.
However, it appears to displace, rather than arise from, the
uterus. It is intimately associated with and inseparable from a
distal loop of small bowel. Given this relationship to the small
bowel and its appearance, this is thought most likely to
represent a small bowel GIST. While neither ovary is seen, this
is
thought less likely to be ovarian in origin given only the trace
amount of
free fluid and no evidence of metastatic disease within the
pelvis.

Pathology:
Small bowel, segmental resection:

Atypical spindle and focally epithelioid neoplasm (13.5 cm in
greatest dimension), consistent with gastrointestinal stromal
tumor of high malignant potential; see note.
Nine mesenteric lymph nodes with no tumor seen (0/9).
Note:  The tumor demonstrates a predominantly spindle cell
pattern arranged in irregular fascicles, with focally
epithelioid areas and foci of prominent necrosis. Tumor nuclei
demonstrate areas of marked pleomorphism with coarse chromatin
and irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemical stains of
the tumor are diffusely, strongly positive for C-kit, focally,
weakly positive for actin, and negative for desmin and S-100,
consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
immunophenotype.

Mitoses number greater than 15 per 50 high power fields and
frequent tumor cell apoptosis is identified. The tumor size of
greater than 10 cm and mitotic activity of  greater than 15 per
50 high power fields confer a high risk of malignant potential

The tumor appears to arise within the muscularis propria, but
extensively involves the submucosa and subserosa, with focally
marked attenuation of the overlying mucosa, and the exact layer
of origin is difficult to discern; definitive mucosal invasion
by tumor cells is not identified. The tumor is received
partially disrupted, precluding definitive evaluation of the
serosal surface for invasion in these areas. Where evaluable in
