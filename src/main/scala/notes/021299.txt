Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo male with PMHx of CAD, PVD, HTN, DM2, diastolic
dysfunction, CRI, atrial fibrillation, admitted to the CCU in
acute respiratory failure the setting of rapid afib in CHF,
intubated/extubated, called out to the floor, with persistent
lower extremity edema refractory to multiple diuretic therapies.


1.Respiratory failure: Pt was transfered to the CCU from the
floor after an acute episode of respiratory distress and hypoxia
in the setting of recurrent rapid afib. SOB did not resolve
after attempted diuresis with IV Lasix 120. Pt's respiratory
failure was most likely secondary to acute CHF secondary to
volume overload resulting from acute renal failure in a pt with
underlying COPD. Pt initially was given bipap with progressive
hypoxia. Pt was intubated and started on AC. Initially, pt was
difficult to ventilate. Pt started off with FiO2 of 1 and PEEP
of 15 on assist control. Over the next several days, the
ventilator settings were weaned down. The patient was difficult
to extubate and therefore remained intubated for the next 2
weeks. The pt was maintained on assist control for a while,
followed by multiple trials of pressure support, and 3 attempts
at extubation.
.
Since pt was significantly volume overloaded on admission,
aggressive diuresis is what helped in weaning the ventilator and
moving towards extubation. Serial chest-xrays were consistent
with congestive heart failure, without evidence of pneumonia.
Initially pt was not aggressively diuresed since it was thought
that he was septic. After resolution of septic physiology, pt
was aggressively diuresed with prn Lasix. Pt was able to
tolerate PS for increasing periods of time. Eventually, RSBI's
decreased to 50-60s and pt was able to tolerate PS 5, PEEP 5.
Three attempts were made to extubate the patient. During the
first attempt, pt had copious amounts of secretions, but lacked
a good cough reflex and was re-intubated for inability to clear
his secretions. The second time, the pt self-extubated himself.
His appeared to be breathing decently, but the pt subjectively
experienced respiratory distress and wished to be intubated; in
addition, he continued to have lots of secretions. It was felt
that tracheostomy was the most likely next step. At this point,
the pulmonary service was consulted to help with extubation.
Pulmonary suggested continued aggressive diuresis. Pt was
started on lasix drip. They also suggested checking for a cuff
leak; if <150cc consider short course of steroids for tracheal
edema. Pt did not have signs of tracheal edema. He was able to
tolerate PS5, PEEP5 with low RSBI. Third attempt at extubation
was made. Pt was able to stay extubated for 2 days ** since
[**12-16**]. At times, pt appears to be working hard to breath, but
remained stable with RR 20-30, O2sats 95-100, and decent ABGs.
On [**12-17**], pt was noted to be wheezy and strigorous.
Re-intubation was considered. However, both pulmonary and
anesthesiology felt that pt did not need re-intubation. Pt was
started on standing solumedrol and racemic epinephrine with
improvement in his wheezing and strigor. Pt became aggitated at
times with increased in the work of breathing. Pt was given prn
sublingual zyprexa 5mg with little improvement in aggitation and
breathing. Haldol 2mg given with little improvement. Morphine
2mg given with some improvement. On [**12-18**], pt was give Zyprexa
10mg prn with improvement in agitation.  Eventually with
aggressive diuresis the patient's respiratory status stabilized.
 He went through a short period of time ~ [**12-21**] - [**12-24**] where he
would become increasingly agitatd and desaturate during the
evening and require sedation with CPAP.  It was thought that the
patient was sundowning and was sending himself into respiratory
distress.  The patient was placed on a standing Haldol dose in
the evening and the prophylactically given CPAP during the
night.  The patient then no longer had desaturation episodes.
He was transferred to the floor and no longer required sedation
or ventilatory assistance.  By discharge he required no oxygen
supplementation. His steroids were tapered to off.
.
2. Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive on transfer to CCU and
started on dopamine drip. Etiology of hypotension included new
onset sepsis, afib, and CHF. Swan
