History of Present Illness:
38 yo female G8 P5 and post-operative day #8 from uncomplicated
Cesarean section was admitted from the ED with shortness of
breath and increasing lower extremity edema.

Patient underwent uncomplicated Cesarean section on [**2105-8-24**] (8
days prior to admission) and was discharged to home 4 days prior
to admission on [**2105-8-28**]. Since discharge, patient reports
shortness of breath which was significantly worse on the day of
admission. Additional symptoms include the following:
- increasing lower extremity edema
- increased frequency of urination with nocturia
- orthopnea
- dyspnea on exertion
- abdominal pain s/p Cesarean section; pain well-controlled with
oxycodone and ibuprofen
- dysuria

She denies cough, fevers, chills, night sweats, sick contacts,
unilateral leg swelling, diarrhea, constipation, or recent
travel.

Upon admission to the ED, temp 101.8, HR 118, BP 173/110, and

diuresed 800mL urine upon arrival to the floor and her shortness
of breath had subjectively improved.

STUDIES:

concerning for ARDS, or possibly CHF secondary to a
cardiomyopathy. Diffuse, multifocal infection is not excluded.
[**9-2**] CXR - same as prev CXR with increased opacities
- [**9-1**] Echo: preserved systolic function EF 60-65% with no
significant valvular abnormalities
- [**9-2**] CXR Mild cardiomegaly. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are R>L.  Mild interval increase in diffuse bilateral alveolar
space opacities in perihilar regions and in the upper lobes
greater in the right side.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 38 yo female G8 P5 s/p recent Cesarean section
admitted with respiratory failure, hypertension, and proteinuria
of unclear etiology.

# Respiratory failure. Etiology of her respiratory distress is
unclear but includes most likely pneumonia (viral or bacterial)
given fever, ARDS with unclear precipitant, or noncardiogenic
pulmonary edema secondary to severe pre-eclampsia.
The patient was originally admitted to the ICU on BiPAP.  Soon
after admission, the patient began to tire and was intubated.
She was treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for 7 days and
diuresed.  She was extubated on [**2105-9-5**] and was oxygenating well
on 3L NC at the time of transfer out of the ICU. At the time of
discharge on HD#8, she had been oxygenating @ 96-99% on room air
x 36 hrs.

# Hypertension. Unclear etiology for patient's sudden onset of
hypertension. Etiology includes post-partum pre-eclampsia or
increased sympathetic tone in the setting of infection and
respiratory distress.  Her pressures were originaly up to the
SBP's >220.  She was started on metoprolol TID and hydralazine
as needed.  Lisinopril was then added and hydralazine was
discontinued. The patient was discharged with blood pressure
under good control on metoprolol.

# Proteinuria. Etiology of proteinuria is unclear although
possible etiologies include post-partum pre-eclampsia or
transient proteinuria in the setting of elevated BPs.  Renal was
consulted and determined that proteinuria was indeed most likely
secondary to severe preeclampsia. Pt will f/u with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 6
weeks and 3 months to ensure resolution of the proteinuria.

# Post-operative C section. Stable with clean wound site.  Pain
was controlled with oxycodone.

# Social. Pt coping well. Seen by social work and support
offered. Partner is coping adequately at home with 6 children
including newborn

HOSPITAL COURSE:
38 yo G8P6 s/p repeat LTCS [**8-24**] with new onset respiratory
distress, HTN and fever. In the ED, temp 101.9, HR 118, BP
173/110, and pulse ox 97% on NRB. She received antibiotics, nebs
and diuretic. In the MICU, she was initially managed with NRB,
gentle diuresis, broad spectrum antibiotics and metoprolol. On
HD#2, she was intubated due to worsening pulmonary function.
Over the course of the day, her resp status and HTN improved but
her UOP was minimal. On HD#4, she is intubated with improved
respiratory function but persistent HTN. Renal consult was
requested. They felt that preeclampsia was the most likely
etiology of this non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with HTN
secondary to volume overload. On HD #5, she was extubated and
transferred out of ICU on HD#6. Pt continued to recover on HD#7
and was discharged in good condition on HD#8.
