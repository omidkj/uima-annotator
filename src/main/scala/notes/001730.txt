Service: Medicine

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1.  Fall.
2.  Stroke.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Endocarditis.
2.  Hemorrhagic stroke.
3.  Sepsis.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Renal failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old male
with no significant past medical history who presented to the
Emergency Room after experiencing right sided weakness after a
fall on the day of admission.  The patient provides a vague
history, however, describes the event as follows, the patient
experienced left sided shoulder pain for approximately one week
in the subsequent developing swelling and a mass over his left
sternoclavicular joint.  The patient went to his primary care
physician where [**Name Initial (PRE) **] reported x-ray of his shoulder was negative. On
the day of admission the patient reported continued right sided
lower extremity pain/numbness, which caused a fall.  In the
Emergency Room he was noted to have a right facial droop.  The
patient's last dental work was [**10-20**].

In the Emergency Room the patient was pan cultured and started
empirically on Vancomycin, Gentamycin for endocarditis and sent
for a CT to evaluate the patient's chest mass and a CT to
evaluate the patient's neurological deficits.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Depression.
2.  Left sided shoulder bursitis.
3.  No history of valve replacement.
4.  Diabetes.
5.  Cholesterol.
6.  Stroke.
7.  Cancer.
8.  Rheumatic fever.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zoloft.
2.  Oxycodone.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, tobacco or intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 96.5, blood pressure
126/53, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 16, 95% on 2 liters.
In general he is an elderly man lying in bed slightly
agitated.  HEENT anicteric.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucosa
dry.  Neck soft, supple.  No JVD.  No carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  2 out of
3 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal base.  Chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  A 4 cm by 5 cm firm
lesion over the left sternoclavicular joint.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
no cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically slightly agitated,
alert and oriented times three with right sided facial droop,
right sided weakness.  Extremities notice of splinter
hemorrhages in extremities.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 22.9, hematocrit 38.3,
platelets 285 and 87, L 3, monocytes 1, 9 bands.
Electrolytes sodium 143, K 4.8, chloride 106, bicarb 24, BUN
48, creatinine 1.4, glucose 103, INR 1.3.  Urinalysis hazy,
small leukocyte esterase, large blood, protein 30, greater
then 50 white blood cells, 6 to 10 red blood cells, many
bacteria.  Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats
per minute, left axis, normal intervals, Qs in 1 and AVL.  No
ST changes. No T wave inversions.  Intraventricular
conduction delay.  Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart
failure, infiltrate or obvious emboli.  CT of the head showed
two intraparenchymal fossae of hemorrhage seen at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]
and white matter junction one most posteriorly along the
phallic at the widex and the other within the left mid
parietal lobe.  These findings likely consistent with the
patient's known history of septic emboli.  CT of the chest
revealed joint effusion with enhancing margins and suggestion
of tiny focus of air within at the left sternoclavicular
joint.  This likely represents an abscess, incidental node in
the lymph nodes in the prevascular space some of which are
borderline enlarged.

On [**2-22**] ALT 96, AST 74, LD 400, CK 133, alkaline phosphatase
308, amylase 308.  Urine culture came back staph aurous coag
positive, resistant to Penicillin.  Blood cultures came back
positive, staph aurous coag positive resistant to Penicillin.
 Echocardiogram from [**2-23**] showed limited study, because the
patient was uncooperative.  The images are poor, left
ventricular wall thickness are normal.  The left ventricular
cavity size is normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic
functio is normal.  LVEF of greater then 55%, no mass or
vegetations are seen in the aortic valve, at least trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve appears
mildly thickened, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation is seen.  No
pericardial effusion.  Echocardiogram from [**2-24**] shows the left
atrium is normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal, over left ventricular systolic function appears
mildly depressed with probable distal septal hypokinesis,
right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.  The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened,
moderate 2+ aortic regurgitation was seen.  No abscess seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, moderate 2+
mitral regurgitation is seen, moderate pulmonary arterial
systolic hypertension with trivial pericardial effusions.
There is a mobile echo dense mass seen on the ventricular
side of the anterior mitral leaflet, which may represent a
vegetation versus ruptured corti.  Compared to the prior
study from [**2-23**] an echo dense may have been present in the
prior study, but images were suboptimal.  Chest x-ray from
[**2-22**] mild upper zone redistribution with no pulmonary edema.
Chest x-ray from [**2-23**] consistent with slight left heart
failure.  This is worsened in the interval.  Chest x-ray from
[**2-24**] showed worsening left heart failure with early pulmonary
edema.  Chest x-ray from [**2-26**] shows OG tip below the left
hemidiaphragm and increasing congestive heart failure.  Chest
x-ray from [**2-27**] shows persistent left basilar opacity and
worsened right lower lung lobe zone patchy opacity indicating
worsening infiltrates with developing pneumonia to be
considered.  Head CT on [**2-24**] possible slight progression of
left posterior frontal hemorrhage is noted.  A question of a
new high right cerebral vertex subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Head
CT from [**2-27**] showed a stable hemorrhagic region compared with
the prior study.  There were new areas of hypodensity within
the left occipital lobe corresponding to a left PCA
distribution.  These findings were discussed with the house
staff.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurological:  The patient initially
evaluated by head CT, which showed areas of hemorrhagic
stroke initially thought likely due to septic emboli.  The
patient continued on Vancomycin.  Once sensitivities came
back from the urine and blood the patient's antibiotic
regimen was changed to Oxacillin once the sensitivity came
back.  Changed to Oxacillin once the sensitivities came back
sensitive to Oxacillin.  Ceftriaxone was later added in his
hospitalization on [**2-27**] when a chest x-ray showed possible
development of a pneumonia.  The patient's symptoms were
thought likely due to septic emboli.

Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with likely sequela
from septic emboli.  An echocardiogram was performed on his
presentation.
