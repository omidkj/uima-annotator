Chief Complaint:
Fever, malaise.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 65215**] is a 71 year old male nursing home resident with a
history of C6 fracture, recent admission for urosepsis, VRE
infection, MRSA wound infection, DVTs, pulmonary embolus,
urinary retention with chronic indwelling foley, CAD s/p CABG,
diastolic CHF, diabetes, and hypertension.   Taken to ED from
nursing home after one day history of fever, lethargy--noted at
NH to be hypoxic with O2 sat 87 on room air.  On presentation to
[**Name (NI) **], pt febrile to 102, HR 100-110, BP in low 90's, RR 22 with O2
sat 92-95 on 4L NC. Initial ABG 7.48/31/77, lactate 2.1.  Given
1 L fluid bolus with brief normalization of pressure but then
SBP to 90's again.    Lactate 3.4, CBC revealed WBC of 24.3 with
8 bands.  Pt given 1 g cefepime, rebolused with fluids, and
received central line.  Started on levophed.  Subsequent lactate
to 1.5.  Repeat WBC 18.1 with no bands.  Repeat ABG 7.37/39/100.
 Pt transferred to MICU for further managmement.
.
Of note, the patient had an [**8-2**] admission for UTI with sepsis:
Mr.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] was started empirically on Linezolid, Ceftazidime, and Flagly

based on his history of multi drug resistant infections and
urine culture grew pseudomonas and E. coli which was only
intermediately susceptible to ceftazidime.  He was started on
Meropenem with satisfactory result.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the Medical ICU for UTI/sepsis with low BP
and a ? of pneumonia.  He is a 71 year old gentleman from
nursing home with history of recent urosepsis, chronic foley,
MRSA infections (pneumonia, meningitis), CAD, DM II,
hypertension admitted for sepsis/septic shock likely secondary
to pneumonia, urinary tract infection or both.  ID was
consulted, and given his extensive nosocomial infection history,
it was decided to empirically start the patient on meropenem and
linezolid. Pt hemodynamically improved on abx, with pressors
rapidly weaned off.  Resp status improved quickly as well.  His
lactate, WBC are trended back to within normal limits.  Urine
cultures returned as MDR E. Coli sensitive to meropenem.
.
1) Septic shock: See also above. Pt was maintained at CVP 8-12
using fluid boluses, MAP> 65, uop > 30. Pt was weaned off
pressors on HD#2. Pt was eventually also weaned off NRB. Pt was
transfused at a Hct below 28 as per MUST protocol (also history
of CAD). Underlying cause was likely pneumonia vs. UTI. Sputum
grew MDR E coli sensitive to Meropenem as mentioned above. Ucx
from [**9-7**] grew Pseudomonas. Sensitivities were pending on
discharge. Antibiotic selection was complicated by h/o MDR UTI,
MRSA, VRE and vancomycin allergy. Pt was started on meropenem
and Linezolid and should complete a 14 day course. 10 more days
to be completed after discharge. Pt was afebrile and
hemodynamically stable on discharge. It is recommended to follow
up on the sensitivities of Pseudomonas growing from his urine
cx.
.
2) Acute renal failure, Cr 2.1 from 0.9 but quickly trending
down to baseline again. Thought to have been prerenal based on
urine lytes, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion. Renal
function was stable on discharge.
.
3) Anemia, 9 point hct drop on admission. Transfused for goal of
28 (sepsis, CAD history). Pt had stable Hct above 30 on
discharge.
.
4) History of CAD, s/p CAB: Pt was continued on aSA, statin,
fondaparinux. Hct goal of 28 (initially 30) while ongoing
sepsis. Antihypertensives were held until patient was
hemodynamically stable again. Then pt was restarted on ACEI and
BB.
.
5) Diastolic CHF: Was monitored with serial CXR. Also on resp
monitor while on fluids. Held ACEi and beta-blocker until septic
shock fully resolved. Then restarted again after that.
.
6) H/o DVT, Pulmonary Embolus: continued fondaparinux.
.
7) DM II: Humalog sliding scale, tight control while infected.
Glargine 5U at bedtime. Last FSBG were 210, 175, 125.
.
8) Sacral decubitus, doesnt appear to be likely source of
infection. Was monitored regularly. Wound care was consulted. Pt
was continued on zinc and vitamin supplementations. Pt also
developed erythema and tenderness around both heels towards the
end of his stay. Continued wound care of these areas is
recommended.
.
9) Hypernatremia: Resolved after free water flushes via G-tube.
Natrium of 143 on discharge.
.
10) Pain control, chronic R leg pain (ulcers). continued
gabapentin. Also lidocaine patch locally.
.
11) GU: Pt known to have BPH. Pt was continued on finasteride.
Pt has chronically Foley placed. UA showed 21-50 RBC. It is
recommended to follow up with his urologist as an outpatient. A
cystoscopy and possibly a suprapubic catheter are to be
considered.
.
12) FEN, Pt was kept on tube feeds. Nutrition was consulted. Pt
was continued on zinc and vitamin supplementations. I/Os were
even on discharge.
.
13) Ppx: Lansoprazole, fondaparinux, bowel regimen
.
14) Access: R IJ (was d/c'ed on [**9-9**]), PIV, PICC placed on [**9-9**]
.
15) Code: Full
