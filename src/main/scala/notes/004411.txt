Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea,fatigue,pancytopenia



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Splectomy


History of Present Illness:
63F with a PMH of ITP, Hypogammaglobulinemia on monthly IVIG,
Colon CA, s/p resection [**4-/2190**] and 6 cycles of
FOLFOX,Hypertension,DM1 with retinopathy, recurrent bronchitis
with bronchiectasis, hepatic cirrhosis on recent biopsy and
recent splenectomy for massive splenomegaly of unclear cause c/b
shocked liver and ARF now with altered mental status in the
setting of persistent significant elevated LFTs and worsening
renal failure. Patient has undergone numerous bone marrow
biopsies, and per report, they have shown no evidence of
malignancy. Last year she was diagnosed with colonic mucinous
adenocarcinoma, for which she underwent right hemicolectomy
([**Hospital1 756**], 5/[**2189**]). She completed 6 rounds of FOLFAX (last round
completed [**1-/2191**]), during which time she required multiple PRBC
transfusions. She was then recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]
Heme/Onc service for symptomatic anemia (HCT 17), for which she
received several transfusions. Continued pancytopenic workup was
un revealing. During that admission, CT imaging showed an
increase in splenomegaly to 23.8cm, prompting concern for
splenic lymphoma versus hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. She
was discharged home [**2191-4-3**] with surgical referral for
consideration of elective splenectomy.

However,she was re-admitted on the medicine service on [**2191-4-12**]
with increasing dyspnea and fatigue and was found to have a
pancytopenic with HCT of 13.2 WBC 1.3 and PLT 40. Bone marrow
biopsy showed hypocellular marrow and MRI abdomen showed
evidence of chronic liver disease with an enlarged liver and
enlarged portal and splenic veins suggestive of portal
hypertension and massive splenomegaly. The cause of her
splenomegaly is unclear and it was wondered whether this may
have been related to portal hypertension. Portal pressure
measurement showed present but not severe portal hypertension
and biopsy showed cirrhosis of unclear cause.Patient elected to
undergoe splenectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the operating room on [**2191-4-21**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**]
and underwent a splenectomy (please refer to the operative note
for further details).Postoperatively patient was kept intubated
due to fluid administration: 3u PRBC, 2u platelets, 2 albumin.
POD 1,patient was self extubated and after a short ICU stay
patient was transferred to the surgical floor. Her postoperative
course was complicated by altered mental status, shock liver
with elevated LFTs and acute kidney injury.

POD [**12-8**] the NGT was out and she was started sips. Her hematocrit
was 21 and she was transfused with 1 unit RBC and post
transfusion ->24 Postoperatively SBPs for the past few days (on
[**4-23**] they had been in the 120's to 130's).

However on POD 4 patient was noted to have brief hypotensive
episodes with SBP 90s. She received albumin/blood transfusion as
needed for hypovolemia. Patient was noted to have worsening
renal function with rising BUN/Creatinine. Of note patient had a
positive urinalysis and was currently being treated for a UTI
with PO Cipro.  Of note, patient had been on vancomycin cefepime
pre-operatively when she was neutropenic and spiking fevers,
however postoperatively she has been afebrile. Thus the
vancomycin and Cefepime were subsequently discontinued. Her
urine culture eventually came back and was negative. Her urine
output was monitored closely and her creatinine were trended.
Serial abdominal exams were performed and of note over the next
several days her abdominal distention gradually worsened.

POD 5([**2191-4-26**]) patient was noted to have increase lethargy and
confusion and was triggered due to change in mental status. Per
nursing staff, patient had intermittent episodes of
hallucination. Her morphine PCA were subsequently discontinued
as there were concerns of accumulation of morphine building up
given ARF. Patient underwent a head CT which was negative and
neurology was consulted. There was concern for hepatic
encephalopathy given the acute rise in LFTs although the ammonia
level was only 35. Regarless, the pt was started on rifaximin
and lactulose. Neurology recommendations were to continue to
correct metabolic derangements and to increase lactulose
titrating to symptomatic improvement and felt no further imaging
was needed at this time. Her MS cont to improve and was at
baseline by the time of discharge.

Nephrology was consulted for further evaluation of patient
worsening renal function. Per nephrology, a renal ultrasound was
obtained which showed bilateral kidneys without evidence of
hydronephrosis or stones. There were large amount of free fluid
is noted throughout the abdomen consistent with ascites. Given
the granular casts seen on UA, likely diagnosis of ATN was
presumed by renal. Patient Nadolol was discontinued due to
continued bradycardia w/ episodes of hypotension. Lasix was
given prn as pt appeared volume overloaded w/ some LE swellingon
exam.

Heme oncology continued to follow patient posto
