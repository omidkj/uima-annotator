Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure after VT arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Central Line placement [**2111-6-23**]
Arterial Line placement [**2111-6-23**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 26 year old male with a past medical history of
pericarditis and myocarditis when he was 18 years old. He had
recently been on vacation oin Cancun. While there he believe
that he ate some contaiminated food or water and began to have
diarrhea, fever, chills, and weakness. On the plane flight home
he developed chest pain, which felt similar to his prior episode
of myocarditis. The pain was described as a middle to left chest
pain, nonradiating. It was associated with weakness and SOB.
This chest pain along with fevers/ chills / vomiting/ dirrhea
since returning from [**Country 149**] prompted his admission to [**Hospital3 12748**]. During his hospital stay he was ruled out for
MI. Last night per records, pt c/o increasing chest pain at
2245. He was given toradol 30mg IV per order. At 2305 (day
before transfer) telemetry monitor alarmed demonstrated vfib. Pt
appeared to be seizing, eyes rolling back, skin with purplish
tint. Pt had a pulse but unresponsive. Then per verbal signout
he developed ? poor pulse arrest V-fib/V-tach arrest s/p CPR x2
and shocked x 1 with return to spontaneous circulation. He was
not intubated at that time. Approximately 4 hours later he was
having hypoxic respiratory failure and sating in the 50's just
prior to a successful intubation. Moreover, the patient was a
difficult intubation requiring 5 attempts and complicated by
copious amounts of vomiting. He was transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. At the time of transfer he was on amiodorone
gtt, heparin gtt (for presumed PE), norepi gtt and paralyzed 1
hour just prior to transfer.

Imaging:
EKG [**2111-6-23**]: sinus rhythm. ST segment elevation in leads I, II,
and V3-V6 with biphasic and inverted T waves suggesting a non-ST
segment elevation myocardial infarction which could be
recent/acute. T wave inversions are also present in leads III
and aVF. No previous tracing available for comparison. QTc 421

TTE [**2111-6-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. A patent foramen
ovale is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%), with apical segments contracting
slightly better (suggestive of non-ischemic etiology). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale with small amount of
right-to-left shunting at rest. Non-dilated left ventricle with
severe global systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular
systolic dysfunction.

CXR [**2111-6-23**]: Cardiac size is top normal.  ET tube is in standard
position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  There are extensive
bilateral consolidations, larger on the left side.  They are
partially obscured by large radiopaque monitoring devices placed
on the chest wall.

TTE [**2111-6-24**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left
venticular cavity size is borderline increased. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Borderline left ventricular cavity enlargement with
global hypokinesis most suggestive of a non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-6-23**],
global biventricular systolic function is improved.

CXR [**2111-6-28**]: The endotracheal tube, NG tube, left subclavian
line have been
removed.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Compared to
the prior
study, the alveolar infiltrates and vascular redistribution are
much improved.

CARDIAC MRI [**2111-6-29**]: The left and right atrial sizes were
normal.  Normal left ventricular cavity
size and wall thickness. Mild global hypokinesis with mild
