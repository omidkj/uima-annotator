Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
liver/kidney transplantation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-10-17**]: Exploratory laparotomy, orthotopic
liver transplant, renal transplant.

[**2199-10-18**]: Exploratory laparotomy, removal of
intra-abdominal packing, liver biopsy, and
hepaticojejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
50M with ESLD due to hepatitis C cirrhosis and ESRD thought
to be multifactorial from HTN, DM and hepatorenal syndrome,
recently started on dialysis, presents today for liver-kidney
transplantation.  His ELSD has been characterized by ascites
(requiring multiple taps), encephalopathy (treated with
lactulose/rifaximin) and grade 1 varices (no history of GI
bleed).  He was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 30596**] for these
issues; he was tapped twice, treated with lactulose for
asterixis, and started on dialysis for worsening renal failure.
He was tapped again yesterday at [**State 792**]Hospital.

He feels well today.  No complaints.  Denies recent fever,
chill,
nausea or vomiting or pain anywhere.


Past Medical History:
PMH: hepatitis C ([**2184**]) c/b cirrhosis, salmonella
gastroenteritis
with acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease with renal
stones s/p lithotripsy ([**2192**]), DM (dx [**2188**], off medications,
diet-controlled), HTN ([**2196**], well-controlled, off medications),
ITP s/p splenectomy ([**2173**]), asthma

PSH: splenectomy [**2173**], lithotripsy [**2192**]


Social History:
SH: Lives with fiancee, has two children.  Prior heroin user,
sober for two years, on methadone program.


Family History:

Pertinent Results:
[**2199-10-20**] LIVER U/S:
1. No evidence of biliary dilation. Patent hepatic vasculature.

2. Stable appearance of a postoperative right perihepatic fluid
collection
adjacent to the right hepatic dome. A left subhepatic collection
is newly
apparent, though this may be secondary to differences in imaging
technique,
and is likely post-operative in nature.

3. Moderate left pleural effusion.

4. Diffusely increased echogenicity of the liver most compatible
with fatty
infiltration, with focal areas of sparing, concerning for a
substantial
parenchymal abnormality.

5. Geographic and nodular hypoechoic areas in the liver, which
may be
associated with focal fatty sparing. A 6 mm lesion in the right
lobe is not
specific; follow-up ultrasound surveillance or consideration of
MR evaluation
is recommended if clinically indicated.

PATH:
Pt's liver: Liver, native hepatectomy (A-M):

Established cirrhosis, confirmed by trichrome stain.
Moderate septal and mild periseptal and lobular mononuclear
inflammation (Grade 2 inflammation), consistent with chronic
viral hepatitis C.
Several microscopic foci of small cell dysplasia; reticulin
stain evaluated.
Gallbladder with chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.
Negative vascular and biliary margin.
Iron stain shows mild iron deposition in hepatocytes.

[**10-18**]/:11 Donor Liver, allograft, needle core biopsy:

1. Moderate mixed macro- and microvesicular steatosis and
focally prominent neutrophils.

2. Mild portal mononuclear inflammation, non-specific.

3. No necrosis or features of acute cellular rejection are seen.


4. Trichrome and iron stains will be reported in an addendum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to hospital for combined liver/kidney
transplant. Pt was brought to OR, after informed consent was
obtained, including explaining to the patient the risks
associated with the donor liver including steatosis and
increased risk of delayed graft function and failure. Intraop
significant hemorrhage with no surgical bleeding but a massive
amount of just diffuse ooze was encountered. Activated
factor VII was given and shortly after the patient began making
clot and drying up. It was not thought to be safe to close
primarily packed the right upper quadrant and the iliac fossa
with sponges and  placed a temporary abdominal closure with
anticipation of returning the patient to the operating room in
24 hours for
washout and definitive closure. Introp received 16 of packed
cells, 6 of CRYO, 15 of
FFP, 5 of platelets and 1 dose of factor VII. See operative
dictation for full details. Transferred to SICU intubated.
Overnight, continued transfusions to goal hct >30, plt >100, INR
<1.5, receiving 7 units pRBCs, 3 plts. Morning POD#1 returned to
OR for Exploratory laparotomy, removal of intra-abdominal
packing, liver biopsy, and hepaticojejunostomy. See operative
dictation for full details. Transferred back to SICU intubated.
[**2199-10-18**] U/S showed all vessels are patent. Over next two days
hct remained stable ~30 with 4 units pRBCs, 3 units plts. No
other transfusions during hospital course.

Extubated on [**2199-10-19**]. Following day had increasing oxygen
requirement secondary to pulm edema as mobilized fluid. Was
diuresed in SICU and transferred to floor on [**2199-10-23**]. Course
on floor was uneventful, except for pain control. Methadone and
dilaudid doses were adjusted apropriately. Was ultimately
continued on home methadone dose 35 mg, and pain well controlled
with intermittent dilaudid po 5 mg q6 prn. Lateral JP d/c'ed
[**10-25**], medial removed [**10-30**]. No evidence ascites leak through JP
sites or incision. Immunosuppression was administered and
titrated per pathway. Ppx was given per pathway.

Pt tolerated regular diet, pain controlled with oral pain
medications, voiding without difficulty, and ambulating. PT felt
safe for pt to be d/c'ed home. On day of discharge pt and staff
felt it safe for pt to be discharged home with VNA.
