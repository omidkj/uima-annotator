Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 47 yo woman who was just discharged yesterday for
influenza-like illness v. pneumonia, treated with doxycycline
due to multiple drug allergies who presents for hypoxia at her
PCP's office.  Pt reports that she woke up on Tuesday with cold
chills, body aches, malaise, and fatigue.  She had uncontrolled
coughing with phlegm with associated chest pain and shortness of
breath.  She also reports urinary incontinence with coughing, no
dysuria, no
urinary frequency.  She was admitted and treated with
doxycycline.  She had refused the influenza swab.  At home, pt
reports that her SOB was improved but she was still has
coughing, associated chest pain, and continued wheezing.  She
continued to have fevers, chills.  However, at her PCP's office,
she was febrile, tachycardic to 122, tachypneic, and satting 86%
after 2 nebulizer treatments.  She also had basilar rales on
exam.  No sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] recent travels.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.5. Labs were notable for WBC
11.5. U/A was notabled for lg blood. CXR showed persistent
bibasilar linear opacities, likely reflecting atelectasis. The
patient received doxycycline.  ED spoke with ID, who rec. cont.
doxy for now; if no improvement, consider desensitization.
Vitals prior to transfer to the floor were:  101.4, 115,
170/100, 25, 97% on 3L.

Review of Systems:
(+) Per HPI plus night sweats, headaches
(-) Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain. No
dysuria, urinary frequency. Denies rashes. No numbness/tingling
or muscle weakness in extremities. All other review of systems
negative.

Past Medical History:
- HTN
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Environmental allergies

Social History:
Patient works for the [**Company 2318**].  She is married with 5 grown
children.  She denies h/o tobacco, ETOH, and IVDU.


Family History:
Mother with h/o multiple heart attacks, now s/p CABG, starting
at 62 yo.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 99.2, 178/121, 114, 28, 98 on 3L
Gen: NAD, AOX3
HEENT: MMM, sclera anicteric, not injected
Neck: no LAD, no JVD
Cardiovascular: tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal s1, s2, no
murmurs appreciated
Respiratory: CTAB, no crackles, occ. wheeze
Abd: normoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, non distended
Extremities: No edema, 2+ DP pulses
NEURO: face symmetric, no tongue deviation
Integument: Warm, moist, no rash or ulceration
Psychiatric: appropriate, pleasant, not anxious


Pertinent Results:
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Persistent bibasilar linear opacities, likely reflecting
atelectasis.
However, a more focal opacification within the retrocardiac
region may be
suggestive of an infectious process or possibly aspiration.

CTA CHEST
Final Report
HISTORY: 47-year-old woman with dyspnea, fever and tachycardia,
not
responding to antibiotics.

COMPARISON: Chest CTA [**2125-6-3**]. Chest radiograph [**11-12**], [**2126**].
TECHNIQUE: Pre- and post-contrast axial images were obtained
through the
chest, using a PE protocol. Multiplanar reformatted images were
generated.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial
tree is
adequately opacified, and there is no pulmonary embolus. The
aorta is normal in size, without acute abnormalities. Great
vessels are unremarkable. The heart size is enlarged. There is
no pericardial effusion. There is no hilar, mediastinal, or
axillary lymphadenopathy by size criteria, although several
small lymph nodes are present in the mediastinum measuring up to
5 mm.

Lungs demonstrate large, wedge-shaped peripherally based,
relatively
homogeneous airspace consolidation at both lung bases. These
contain
prominent air bronchograms, and consolidation extends to the
hila.
Consolidation sometimes spares the most peripheral parts of the
lungs.
Following contrast administration, these regions are relatively
well
enhancing. There is intervening normal parenchyma between the
regions of
consolidation. Overall, this pattern is more consistent with
cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia rather than infection.
No nodules or masses are identified, although evaluation is
limited given
respiratory motion artifact. There is no pleural effusion.
FINDINGS: The tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental
levels.
While this exam is not optimized for assessment of the abdomen,
no acute
abnormalities are noted in the upper abdomen.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No worrisome bony lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
2. Multiple wedge-shaped consolidations at both lung bases, in a

configuration most suggestive of cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia rather than infectious pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo woman with PMHx sig. for HTN who represents with fever and
hypoxia 1 day after discharge for pneumonia on doxycycline.

Pneumonia: CT scan confirmed bibasilar pneumonia, concerning for
aspiration.  ID and allergy consulted.  Given her multiple
severe antibiotic allergies, she was taken to the ICU for
meropenem desensitization.  She did well on meropenem with
steady improvement in her hypoxia and fevers.  A midline was
placed [**11-16**].  Doxycycline discontinued [**2126-11-17**] per ID.  She
will complete a 14 day course of meropenem.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] will see
her in [**Hospital **] clinic in followup.  Given question of cryptogenic
organizing PNA and interstitial abnormalities seen on CT, she
would also benefit from pulmonary followup.  EpiPen provided at
discharge.

Hypertension: Continued home medications.

Tachycardia: the patient had intermittant sinus tachycardia
throughout her admission.  CTA was negative for PE. She reports
that she has tachycardia at baseline, suspect aggravated by
infection.

OSA / ? aspiration: there is concern that the patient is having
nocturnal aspiration with her OSA.  Speech and swallow eval
normal.  Refused CPAP in house.

Urticaria:  The patient developed hives 4 hours after her third
dose of meropenem.  She was seen by allergy, who felt this was
likely due to chronic uritcaria and not a drug reaction.  She
was given one dose of solumedrol and benadryl.  She was started
on daily high dose fexofenadine.
