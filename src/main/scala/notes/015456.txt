Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
wound infection and pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
wound vac changes
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:

66y/o M w/ CAD s/p PCI, s/p CABG c/b wound dehiscence x2 and
wound infection requiring ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and
tobramycin, h/o rib osteomyelitis, tracheal bronchitis/PNA with
pseudomonas, CHF, COPD, HTN who is being transferred from NESH
for plastic surgery evaluation of his wound dehiscence. He has
been severe pain in the area of his wound. The inferior ribs
that are exposed in his wound end up rubbing against each other
with each exhalation causing severe pain. In addition, his stay
there at NESH was c/b acute renal failure (all abx were stopped)
and acute blood loss anemia (received 3 units between [**1-12**]/and
[**1-13**]/). Patient had been sent out of here on [**12-30**] with a 6 week
course of abx but the antibiotics (pseudomonas/acinetobacter)
were stopped about [**1-12**] including tobra and vanc. The cipro was
stopped earlier. This was dictated by ID consultants at [**Hospital1 **].
.
At time of presentation the patient's main complaint is that his
chest hurts when he breathes. This is the same pain he has had
since his ribs began to rub together. It is not the same as his
anginal pain. He has no other complaints. Denies SOB, abd pain,
N, V, diarrhea, dizziness, changes in vision/hearing, confusion,
or head ache.

.
CXR: Chronic interstitial lung disease with interval improvement
and left upper lobe opacity.
.
Chest CT:
1. No mediastinal fluid collection.
2. Increasing size of 13-mm left upper lobe nodule. It may be
secondary to an inflammatory or infectious etiology. However,
given the background of severe emphysema, bronchogenic carcinoma
is also considered. Follow-up CT should be performed in [**6-8**]
weeks to exclude further growth.
3. Tiny faint centrilobular nodules more pronounced in the
dependent portion of the right lung base may be secondary to
infection or aspiration.
4. Over-distended tracheostomy tube cuff.
.
Renal U/S: Severe left hydronephrosis with cortical thinning is
unchanged compared to [**2174-11-3**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 66 yo M with w/ CAD s/p PCI, s/p CABG c/b wound dehiscence
x2 and wound infection requiring ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and
tobramycin, h/o rib osteomyelitis, tracheal bronchitis/PNA with
pseudomonas, CHF, COPD, HTN who is being transferred from NESH
for plastic surgery evaluation of his wound dehiscence.
.
# Wound Dehiscence: Pt admitted with wound pain. Plastics was
consulted and changed his wound vac several times. They did not
recommend further operations at this time. His pain was initally
controlled with MS Contin with prn morphine but when his pain
could not be controlled, he was started on a morphine PCA. This
controlled the pain and the pt appeared much more comfortable.
The PCA was stopped one day prior to discharge and pt did not
require prn pain meds.
.
# Wound Infection: During the prior admission, cultures from the
wound grew pseudomonas [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro, acinetobacter [**Last Name (un) 36**] to
gent/tobra and MRSA. These abx were discontinued 4 days prior to
admission once creatinine started to rise. Pt spiked a temp on
hospital day #2 and the antibiotics were resumed per ID recs.
On further evaluation, ID believed that pt had completed a
sufficient course of antibiotics for his wound infection.  An
MRI was done of the chest which confirmed no evidence of
osteomyelitis or soft tissue collections.
.
# Fever: Pt spiked a fever on HD#2 associated with resp
distress, possibly due to an aspiration event.  Pt was started
on ciprofloxacin to cover hx of pseudomonas in his sputum and
tobramycin to cover acinetobacter.  He completed a course of
these antibiotics and they were stopped on [**2174-1-24**] after 7 days.

.
# Acute on CRF: Creatinine 2.3 on admission, above baseline of
1.5 but improved from peak of 2.9. The creatinine improved to
2.1 during the admission but rose to 3.5 after the antibiotics
were resumed.  Once the tobramycin was stopped, his creatinine
trended down and stabilized at 2.9-3.0.
.
# Respiratory Failure/COPD: Pt is vent dependent but he
tolerated trach mask trials well.  He rested on pressure support
[**10-10**] at night. His lung mechanics are also complicated by his
severe COPD and hx of a lobectomy. He was continued on his
inhalers.
.
# Adrenal Insufficiency: Random cortisol was checked and found
to be low at 2.4.  His prednisone was changed from 5mg qd to
hydrocortisone 25mg for a better replacement dose.  He had no
signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.
.
# Anxiety: Pt was continued on his home dose of Klonopin for
control of his anxiety.  Ativan was given once but caused marked
lethargy.  To have better control of his anxiety, he was started
on Buspar.
.
# Lung Nodule: Pt found to have 13mm lung nodule on chest CT.
He will need a follow up chest CT in [**5-7**] weeks.
.
# FEN: Pt able to tolerate po so NGT was pulled.  Calorie counts
were insufficient so a PEG tube was placed by GI.  Tube feeds
were started and pt tolerated well.
.
# Access: PICC line was changed on [**2174-1-24**] due to malfunctioning
port.
