Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8182**] is a 63 yo M a history of CVA , recent pseudomonas
pna (s/p trach and peg [**3-/2200**]) afib (coumadin), c diff s/p
colectomy, DM, PVD presents from [**Hospital1 1501**] with fever to 101

#1. Sepsis (PNA & UTI): Pt was in SIRS upon admission to the
emergency room, with a  fever of 101 (pre hospital) and a
profound leukocytosis of 21.9.  He was not tachycardic or
tachypnic however.  A CXR revelead bilateral basilar infiltrates
suspicious for pneumonia, and an initial urine dipstick had
moderate blood and trace leukocytes with f/u microscopic exam
showing [**2-21**] WBC's and moderate amounts of bacteria and trace
epithelial cells.  When the pt. entered the ER, he was
hypotensive with a BP of 82/43.  A decision was made for
transfer to MICU for the pt's probable sepsis.  Since the pt.
came from a [**Hospital1 1501**] and is a known MRSA carrier, he was treated in
ER for possible HCAP with Vancomycin 1 g IVx1 and Cefepime 2 g
IV x1.  Prior to admission to the ICU, the pt's BP spontaneously
resolved to 108/56.

While in the ICU, the pt remained stable.  The pt's hypotension
improved with several IV boluses and the institution of tube
feeds.  Additionally, pt. remained afebrile for last 48 hours
and leukocytosis has improved from 21.6 with a left shift on
admission to 8.8 on [**6-11**]. His antibiotic regimen was changed to
Vancomycin 1 G IV q12 as he is a known MRSA carrier, Meropenem
500 mg IV Q6H as the patient has had a history of resistant P.
aeuriginosa pneumonia, and Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q12H for
double coverage of possible P. aeuriginosa.  Additionally, he
continued to receive Vancomycin Oral Liquid 250 mg PO/NG Q6H for
his history of C.Diff Colitis from the [**Hospital1 1501**].  The pt remained
stable and he was transferred to the floors on [**6-10**].

An etiology for his SIRS was attempted to be elicited prior to
the start of antibiotics.  Sputum cx's positive for sparse and
rare growth of GNR's. Urine cultures were performed and were
postive for GNR's >10,000 and later identified as PROVIDENCIA
STUARTII.  Blood cultures were performed but indeterminate.  The
pt. continued to be stable.  A PICC line was placed on [**6-13**] o
the patient can receive IV antibiotic treatment out of the
hospital.

Mr. [**Known lastname 8182**] has received a total of 5 days(doses) of his IV
antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Ciprofloxacin.
 He will continue to receive antibiotics out of hospital for 10
more days, with the last day of treatment on [**2200-6-23**].  Of note,
his Ciprofloxacin has been changed to 500 mg PO q12hrs.

#2. C. Difficile infection s/p colectomy: The patient has a
history of C.Diff in the past, and according to his [**Hospital1 1501**] the
patient had positive C diff [**2200-5-20**] and was restarted on po
vancomycin 250 cc's. There are case reports of extracolonic C
diff in the literature, including small bowel involvement in the
setting of recent colectomy. Repeat C. Diff toxins were
performed on [**6-10**], but were negative in the hospital most likely
becuase the patient has been receiving treatment.  Additionally,
the patient did not have any episodes of profound diarrhea while
in the hospital.  As the patient will be receiving large amounts
of antibiotics out of the hospital, he should continue his po
vancomycin while on broad spectrum antibiotics, with the plan to
continue for at least 14 days after broad spectrum antibiotics
are completed in order to prevent recurrence.

#3 Atrial fibrillation: Mr. [**Known lastname 8182**] has a history of atrial
fibrillation.  On admission he was in sinus tachycardia with
evidence of an old RBBB.  During his hospital course, his
coumadin became supratherepeutic, with an INR of 4.0 on [**6-11**] and
[**6-12**] likely due to antibiotics therapy.
