History of Present Illness:
83 yo M with history of DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, AAA s/p
repair, recent IMI [**7-10**], s/p DES to LCx with severely depressed
EF admitted to CCU now returns with recurrent chest pain.
Patient reports developing chest "tightness" localized to LUQ,
lower left chest, focal, non radiating, no N/V/diaphoresis, no
SOB. Anginal equivalent is sob, never has had CP before. He was
at rest, wife gave him 3 sl ntg without relief, here nitro
without relief, relieved by morphine. Of note, patient w/ SVT
atrial flutter s/p DCCV on last admission. Patient went to
[**Hospital1 **], transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
.
In the ED VS 110/72 77 18 99% 2L. Given ASA 162, sl ntg x 3,
nitro past, plavix, heparin gtt, integrilin gtt, morphine 2 mg
IV x 2, nitro gtt. Continued to have CP [**2139-4-5**] at 12:25, nitro
increased with relief of pain to 0/10, no EKG changes. Again CP
[**4-13**] at 17:20, nitro increased, came up to floor with 1/10 CP
not able to be relieved.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, VSS, denies any CP, says morphine
helping, denies any change in stool, no melena/brbpr, last BM
yesterday, normal diet cooked by wife last night, no PND, stable
2 pillow orthopnea. No N/V/diarrhea as mentioned above, no
cough, URI symptoms. Ambulates around house, does not do stairs,
limited by arthritis. Reports compliance with meds since
discharge in [**7-10**].

CXR [**8-28**]: FINDINGS: Again noted is apical bullous disease. There
is no focal consolidation or superimposed edema-like process.
There is mild tortuosity of an atherosclerotic aorta. Cardiac
silhouette remains borderline enlarged. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Emphysema with no radiographic evidence for volume
overload.

CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST [**8-29**]: Pulmonary arteries enhance
normally without filling defect. There is an enlarged nodular
goiter. Moderate emphysematous changes in the lungs. Biapical
scarring. Again identified is a concerning spiculated nodule
just adjacent to the minor fissure, which is difficult to
accurately measure but is approximately 1.4 x 0.8 cm. However,
it appears more pronounced and denser than on the prior CT.
There is a second 3-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe,
which is unchanged. Small nonspecific nodular opacity in the
right lower lobe appears new. Scarring in the left lower lobe.
There is extensive calcified atherosclerotic plaque throughout
the ascending aorta with multiple areas of large penetrating
ulcers. There been no interval development of extension into
aortic dissection. Ectasia but no definite aneurysmal
dilatation. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen
throughout the axilla, mediastinum, and hilum. Heart,
pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable with the
exception of coronary artery calcification and heart size upper
limits of normal. Limited axial imaging through the upper
abdomen demonstrates no abnormalities. No focal osseous
abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Severely atherosclerotic thoracic aorta with multiple
prominent penetrating ulcers.
3) Multiple pulmonary nodules; the spiculated nodule along the
minor fissure appears worrisome, and perhaps slightly more dense
than the prior CT scan. PET/CT may be helpful for further
assessment.
4) Emphysema with biapical scarring.

Persantine MIBI [**8-30**]: The image quality is adequate. The arms
are suboptimally positioned. Motion correction was performed on
the stress perfusion images.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the myocardium.
Gated images reveal septal hypokinesis. The loss of photon
counts in the last frame of the gated images is consistent with
arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation).  The calculated left
ventricular ejection fraction is 58%.
There is no prior myocardial perfusion imaging study available
for comparison.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion. Normal left ventricular
cavity size. Septal hypokinesis. Calculated LVEF 58%.

Stress [**8-30**]:
INTERPRETATION: This 83 year old type 2 IDDM man with a history
of
CAD and AF was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain.
The
patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4
minutes.
Prior to the test, he noted a "severe" chest discomfort that was

localized to under his left breast. This discomfort did not
change
throughout the procedure. There were no additional ST segment
changes
during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was atrial
fibrillation
throughout. Appropriate he
