Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5295**]
Chief Complaint:
HA, malaise, fevers


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Coronary artery Catheterization.


History of Present Illness:
73yo Female with Myeloproliferative disease, ANCA associated
vasculitis, PMR on long standing steroids, and diverticulosis
who presents with 2 days of malaise, severe frontal HA, fever,
chills, and nausea.
  In ED received pt was SaO2 >95% on RA, no respiratory
distress.  Pt received CXR, Abd CT (nml), Chest CT (septal
thickening of unclear etiology), LP (ng).  Given Vanc and Levo
on floor for possible PNA as well as stress dose steroids for
PMR.  Pt planned for CTA on AM of admission to MICU.  Approx
11pm the previous night the pt developed SSCP, initially
attributed by pt to "heartburn".  No further evaluation at that
time.  On morning of transfer, however complained of increased
shortness of breath and CP, sinus tachy, SaO2 to 90% -> 80 ->
50% -> 30%.  Pt bagged, but remained tachypneic, tachycardic and
complained of "impending doom".  ABG at time was following:
7.09/63/46 while being bagged.  Pt was given lasix, started on
heparin bolus, and intubated.
.
In unit, repeat CXR showed development of new b/l infiltrates.
In addition, pt subsequently developed elevated  TnT 0.24 at
last draw. MB fraction of 14.3 at peak, now trending down (<0.01
in ED).  ECG sinus tach without any ischemic changes.  Continued
on levofloxacin/vancomycin, lactate trending down, bp stable o/n
(3.0 to 1.3).  Interval improvement in CXR.  Continued on hep
gtt

CT abd:
1.  Marked pulmonary septal thickening and bronchovascular
bundle thickening. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary
edema, lymphoma, and lymphangitic spread of tumor.  Sarcoidosis
can also have this radiographic appearance, but is considered
less likely.
2.  Diverticulosis.  No evidence of diverticulitis.
3.  Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.  This is
nonspecific and may
be within physiologic range.
4.  Splenomegaly.
.
CT Head:
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect
.
CXR: Extensive b/l air space consolidation
.
ECG: Sinus 100bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, twi in L, V1, V2.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.)  Respiratory Failure:
    CXR on admission to MICU ([**10-14**]) c/w acute pulmonary edema
felt to be related to ischemia (also c/w edema on on CT -septal
thickening) vs. diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, although hct
stable, no blood from ett.  Pt with multiple risk factors for
CAD and was under acute stress.  Troponins rose with ST
depressions in V3-6.  She was not r/o for PE given renal
failure.
    She was diuresed and improved quickly on the vent with
decreased oxygen requirements.  She was changed to pressure
support and then extubated on [**10-15**] without complication.  Her
oxygen requirements continued to decrease and was on room air by
[**10-17**].
.
2) Elevated CE's:
    Pt thought to have cardiac event which precipitated her
flash pulm edema.  Given the elevated troponins and depressed ST
she was started on heparin, asa, and beta blocker.  Echo on
[**10-15**] demonstrated no wall hypokinesis, and mild AR/TR/MR.  She
remained on these drugs and was transfered to the floor for cath
on [**10-19**].   Premedicated for cath with prednisone, hydration,
pepcid, and mucomyst.  Cath demonstrated mild diastolic
dysfunction and totally occluded D1.  This vessel was opened
using angioplasty.  Stent's not used because the pt isunable to
tolerate plavix with her myeloproliferative disorder.  On [**10-15**]
Lipid panel taken (TC 168 TG 200 LDL 82) and lipitor started
prior to discharge.  Will change lopressor to toporol on
discharge.  Also clonodine patch started for further BP control.
 Also started lisinopril with improving creatinine on discharge.
.
3)  Fever:
    Felt to be infectious vs vasculitis.  Pt at risk for
infection due to your chronic immunosupression.  Initially
started on aztreonam but then switched to vanc/levo [**12-21**] history
of allergy.   She became afebrile and remained so for the rest
of the admission.  Vanc stopped on [**10-16**] and pt remained
afebrile on levoflox.  Plan is to finish 10 day course of
levoflox which will end [**2151-10-23**].
.
4) Myloproliferative Disease/ANCA vasculitis:
    Prednisone and Cellcept continued.  Epo started per
oncology.

5) Skin Tears - Due to chronic steroid use, the pt has developed
skin tears.  The worst of thes was on her left shin.  These
bleed a great deal due to the heparin gtt and decreased plt
function.  Pressure dressings and duoderm were not effective at
controling the bleeding.  As a result freq dressing changes were
required.  Once heparin gtt stopped bleeding derceased then
stopped.  By discharge having non-adherant dressing like
adaptect changed [**Hospital1 **].

6) Hypothyroidism - levothyroxine continued.

7)  PPx: bowel prep, PPI.
