Imaging:
EGD [**4-2**]:
1. Keep patient intubated and NPO
2. Continue ocreotide gtt @ 50 mcg / hr
3. Continue Protonix gtt @ 8 mg hr
4. Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV Q24 for a total of 7 days
5. Check HCT q12 hrs
6. Transfuse to keep an HCT of 25-27
7. Try to keep plt > 50 and INR < 1.5
8. Once BP and HR stable will need a non selective beta-blocker
9. Follow hepatology recs

RUQ Ultrasound: IMPRESSION:
1. Coarsened and echogenic hepatic parenchyma with the sequelae
of portal
hypertension including splenomegaly and recanalized
paraumbilical vein with patent portal vein and no evidence of
ascites.
2. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis
3. Large right pleural effusion

AP CXR [**4-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Nasogastric tube in the distal esophagus, could be advanced
15 cm.
2.  Large right pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema with
cardiomegaly, new since [**2168**].

CXR [**4-4**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  The
extensive right
pleural effusion has minimally decreased in extent, the evidence
of moderate
pulmonary edema is still present.  Unchanged size and appearance
of the
cardiac silhouette.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 year old M with ETOH cirrhosis MELD of 32, CKD, presenting
with massive upper GI bleed.
.
1. GI Bleed: patient with large volume hematememsis and coffee
ground emesis, with HCT of 9 at OSH. Transfused 9U PRBC, 8U FFP
and 10U plts.  HCT up to 23 on arrival and up to 29 on repeat.
No evidence of varices on previous EGDs, but hepatology
performed EGD bedside in ED which showed severe esophagitis and
severe portal gastropathy, and still no evidence of varices.
Started on octreotide and PPI drips, which were continued for 72
hours. Started on IV ceftriaxone 1 gram IV Q24hrs, which was
switched to Cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] which he completed a 7 day course.
The patient's Hct remained stable around 30 on the floor. He was
transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] protonix. He was given sucrafate for
esophagitis. He will have a repeat EGD in 12 weeks after
starting PPI (already scheduled).
.
2. Narrow Complex Tachycardia: The patient's HR was sustained in
the 140s during one night of admission. EKG showed a narrow
complex tachycardia most consistent with an SVT. Vagal maneuvers
were attempted without success. The patient was given low dose
beta blockers. He spontaneously converted to NSR the next
morning. He remained in
