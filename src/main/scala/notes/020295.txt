History of Present Illness:
75 year old male, who presented to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital on Friday
with 2 days of fevers up to 102, increased work of breathing,

he was placed in the ICU. Since Friday, the erythema has spread
up his arm despite treatment with IV Vancomycin and Zosyn. He
has also developed erythema of his cheeks. Blood cultures have
been negative. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further

.
[**2151-5-16**] CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST:
Post-surgical changes within the bilateral maxillary sinuses
with mucosal thickening and opacification of the left maxillary
sinus. No air-fluid levels identified.

[**2151-5-17**] UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT:
No evidence for DVT in the visualized left upper extremity vein.
.
[**2151-5-17**] CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM:
Tip of the right PIC line is in the region of the superior
cavoatrial junction. Small bilateral pleural effusions and
infrahilar opacification probably due to atelectasis are of
indeterminate chronicity. The upper lungs are grossly clear and
the heart is not enlarged.
.
[**2151-5-18**] EKG:
Probable sinus tachycardia. Low limb lead voltage. Early R wave
progression.
Non-diagnostic inferior Q waves. ST-T wave abnormalities. No
previous tracing
available for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2151-5-18**] AP CXR:
IMPRESSION: No interval change since one day prior. Respiratory
motion
limits evaluation of ill-defined patchy basilar opacities.
Recommend PA and lateral chest radiographs for further
evaluation.
.
[**2151-5-21**] EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Borderline low limb lead voltage. ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Early R wave progression. Since the previous tracing of [**2151-5-18**]
ST-T wave
abnormalities are more prominent. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
.
[**2151-5-21**] AP CXR:
IMPRESSION: Improving right lower lobe opacity is probably
resolving aspiration or infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from [**Doctor Last Name 86143**] Hospital and
admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2151-5-16**] for
further evaluation and treatment of the facial and left arm
erythema and swelling. Admission Neck CT revealed no evidence of
fluid collection or soft tissue gas within the neck,
redemonstration of opacification of the left maxillary sinus,
and emphysematous changes in the lung apices bilaterally.
Facia/sinus CT demonstrated post-surgical changes within the
bilateral maxillary sinuses with mucosal thickening and
opacification of the left maxillary sinus. No air-fluid levels
identified. He was made NPO, continued on IV fluids, and
continued on antibiotic therapy with IV Clindamycin, Vancomycin,
and Zosyn. Otolaryngology was consulted related to the facial
swelling and erythema; HEENT and fiberoptic exams were
unremarkable. Later on [**2151-5-16**], the patient underwent incision
and drainage of left arm and counterincision for fascial
exploration, drainage and debridement, which went well without
complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). Patient was extubated in OR and returned to the ICU
NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and
Morphine IV PRN for pain control. The patient was
hemodynamically stable. Later on [**2151-5-17**], the patient was
transferred to the inpatient floor.
.
Neuro: The patient received Morphine IV PRN with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications. Patient was started
on Dilaudid and Tylenol for pain control with good result. On
discharge, patient was started on PO Vicodin. He remained
neurologically intact.
.
CV: When triggered on POD#2 for shortness of breath, EKG was
performed and cardiac enzymes were sent. EKG revealed sinus
tachycardia, and enzymes returned normal. The patient denied
experiencing any chest pain. Th
