History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20816**] is a 64 yo female with COPD, schizophrenia,
psychogenic polydipsia who presented to the ED today with
dyspnea. Per her boyfriend she was in her usual state of health
until the day prior to presentation. He recalls that she wasn't
taking any of her medications and he asked her to restart them
approximately 24 hours ago. She was not experiencing any fevers,
chills, cough, nasal congestion or in general having any
complaints. On the evening of presentation she had acute onset
shortness of breath which worsened over approximately an hour.
She was taken to the emergency room.
.
On arrival to the ER her initial vitals were T: 98.1 HR: 105 BP:
182/100 RR: 50 O2: 98 % on RA. She stated that she couldn't
breath but denied chest pain, recent cevers or chills. She did
note a mild cough which was not worse than usual. She was noted
to be extremely aggitated. She received nebulizer treatments,
steroids but despite this showed no signs of improvement. ABG
was 7.30/56/145. She became more agitated and began trying to
pull her mask off and became more tachypneic. Given her
worsening respiratory status, she was intubated without
difficulty. She was continued on nebulziers and steroids and was
started on levofloxacin. She also received 3 L of normal saline
and magnesium 2 gram. CXR did not have any acute consolidations
but did show hyperexpansion. She had an arterial line placed.
She was conitnued on propofol for sedation. She was transferred
to the ICU for further management.
.
Upon arrival the ICU, patient is intubated and appears
comfortable. Cannot confirm further clinical history.

Echo ([**2123-8-14**]) - The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild to moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with past medical history of COPD and
schizophrenia presented with severe COPD exacerbation leading to
respiratory failure and intubation.
.
1. Respiratory Failure - On admission, based on the patient's
history, arterial blood gas, and chest x-ray the most likely
etiology for the patient's respiratory failure was likely a COPD
exacerbation. The patient was intubated in the emergency
department secondary to worsening respiratory status and
increased agitation. She was initially placed on Solumedrol,
Ipratropium/albuterol, and Levofloxacin.  Blood, urine, and
sputum cultures were all negative. She was tapered from
solumedrol and since no source of infection was found, the
Levofloxacin was discontinued. She was extubated one day into
her admission without incident, and transferred from the
intensive care unit to the medical floor. She continued on
Spiriva, Albuterol and Iprotropium and was successfully weaned
off of her supplemental oxygen to her baseline saturation of the
low 90s. While her oxygen saturation during exertion would
qualify her for supplemental home oxygen, she cannot qualify due
to her heavy smoking. She will follow-up with her outpatient
primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 766**].
.
2. Hyponatremia - The patient's hyponatremia was likely related
to her known psychogenic polydipsia, but an underlying component
of SIADH could not be ruled out.  On admission, the patient was
placed on free water restriction, and the hyponatremia resolved.
She was maintained on 1000 mL/day of fluid restriction and her
serum Na was stable at 138 on the day of discharge.
.
3.  Atrial Fibrillation - On the second morning of her
hospitalization, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with
a rapid ventricular response. Old discharge summaries makes note
of history of multifocal atrial tachycardia, but no atrial
fibrillation was noted. This arrythmia was thought to be due to
her high stress response in the intensive care unit. She was
given 5 mg IV metoprolol which maintained her rate at an
appropriate level and started on 25 mg of oral metoprolol three
times a day. Given her COPD status, she was appropriately
transitioned to 120 mg of Diltiazem extended release once a day.
She is to follow-up appropriate titration of this medication in
the outpatient setting.
.
 She was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and
prepartion for possible cardioversion if she did not
spontaneously convert to a sinus rhythm. Her telemetry readings
through the course of her admission showed a paroxysmal type of
atrial fibrillation. Since she did not persisantly stay in this
irregular rhythm, she was not cardioverted. The heparin drip was
stopped.
.
 The patient's CHADS2 score was 1, so Aspirin 325 mg was
initiated without the need for warfarin therapy. Of note, a
concern for medication compliance also prevented the team from
aggressive treatment with warfarin. Further management of
anti-coagulation will be deferred to the outpatient setting.
.
4. Schizophrenia - The patient's boyfriend stated she recently
stopped her anti-psychotic medications and re-started the day
prior to presentation. Through the course of her admission, she
maintained her home psychiatric medications and was stable
