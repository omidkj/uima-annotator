Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo male with a h/o CAD, afib on coumadin,

[**7-15**] with fever to 103.6, complaining of shakes. Patient states
that he was previously feeling well and had taken care of his
grandkids and went swimming earlier in the day. On the night of
presentation, he developed chills, rigors x 1 hour, and a fever
to 103.6. On arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 **], a CXR was interpreted
to show a RLL infiltrate, and he was started empirically on
levofloxacin. Patient was witnessed to rigor again and become
very hypoxic and cyanotic with SpO2 in 50's, improved with 100%
NRB. ABG at that time 7.34/39/100. He was transferred to the ICU
at [**Hospital1 **] for closer monitoring, and antibiotic coverage was
broadened to Vanc and Zosyn. On the morning of [**7-16**], a d-dimer
returned at 472.5; a CTA chest was performed and was reported as
negative for PE. He was noted to have elevated troponins and
thus was transferred to the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. As above, ROS is notable for recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Microscopic polyangiitis: Pt with BAL positive for blood and
macrophages consistent with flare of his pulmonary vasculitis.
Rheumatology consulted. Pt was given 1g solumedrol per day for
three days and then planned for steroid taper. Azathioprine was
held. Pt did extremely well on this regimen and was transfered
off of the MICU service for further management and steroid
taper. Pt was restarted on cyclophosphamide per rheumatology
recs. It is worth noting that the Pt has some blood and protein
in his urine with R CVA tenderness for the past few weeks, the
same timeframe in which this flare occured. This raises the
concern for renal involvement by his disease, but there is no
clear evidence for renal vasculitis at this time. Pt was
discharged on cyclophosphamide and prednisone.  Pt will follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2087**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], Rheumatology at [**Hospital1 18**], and Pulmonology
at [**Hospital1 18**].  He will be monitored with weekly CBCs and UAs.
.
# Pancytopenia: leukopenia and anemia seemingly a sequelae of
azathioprine use. Given the pancytopenia and the polyangiitis
flare while on this drug, azathioprine was held. Pancytopenia
resolved and pt was restarted on cyclophosphamide per
rheumatology.
.
# Fevers: An extensive fever work up was undertaken before the
etiology of his symptoms and signs were clear. As of transfer
off of the MICU service all cultures, serologies, and test were
negative. Fever likely secondary to alveolar hemorrhage.  Fever
resolved and did not return during hospitalization.
.
# A-fib: Stable; Pt was continued on home meds for rate control.
 Coumadin was held in setting of alveolar hemorrhage. Will be
restarted in one week under the supervision of his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
