History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 58650**] is a 60 year old woman with past medical history
significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension and schizophrenia, presenting with a
5-day history of worsening dyspnea and fear of falling.
.
Over the past few days (since [**3-19**]), patient has noted
increasing dyspnea both at rest and on exertion. She uses a
cane. She is unable to provide a clear history regarding
baseline ability to walk without dyspnea.  However over the last
few days her dyspnea has worsened to the point where it is
difficult for her to get dressed in the morning.
.
During this time she has noted a worsening cough, productive of
green non-bloody sputum. She denies fever or chills. She also
notes feeling "flushed in the face" over the past several weeks.
She uses two pillows to sleep. She denies peripheral edema or
increasing abdominal girth. She endorses chest pain for three
days which is sternal, constant, and exacerbated with palpation.
She has no recent travel history and is not able to describe
sick contacts. She denies nausea or vomiting. Of note, the
patient is a resident at [**Doctor Last Name **] House and was not able to provide
a reliable history.
.
The patient also reports fear of falling over the past few days.
She feels somewhat unstable and is afraid of falling
unsupervised. She has not fallen yet. She denies headaches,
light-headedness, blurred vision, or feeling faint.
.

given aspirin and nitroglycerin, albuterol and ipratropium
bromide nebs x2 and methylprednisolone, and started on
azithromycin and ceftriazone for community-acquired pneumonia
coverage. Her saturation was 92% on 3L nasal cannula after
nebulizer administration. Pt was admitted to the medicine floor.

Imaging:
CXR (admission):
 An endotracheal tube has been placed in the interval with the
tip of the tube lying 4.9 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube
has been inserted in the interval with the tip below the
diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. The heart is
enlarged. There is continued perihilar haziness and vascular
engorgement consistent with congestive heart failure which is
slightly improved in the interval. A more focal opacity is seen
in the right lower lobe likely representing pneumonia, which
appears slightly improved in the interval. There is no
pneumothorax. No effusions are seen.

IMPRESSION:

1. Satisfactory placement of endotracheal tube and nasogastric
tube.

2. Minimal improvement in congestive heart failure.

3. Slight interval improvement in right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CXR ([**2130-3-27**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Widening of the left mediastinal contour lateral to aortic
knob calcification, concerning for aortic dissection. CTA of the
chest is recommended for further evaluation. Differential
diagnosis includes lymphadenopathy and mediastinal lipomatosis.
2. Improving CHF and resolving right lower lobe process.
.
CTA chest/abd/pelvis ([**2130-3-27**]):
1. Consolidative opacities in the lower lobes dependently are
suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary
nodules. This could represent metastatic disease (possibly
breast cancer given the patient's mastectomy), lymphoma, or an
inflammatory process such as sarcoid. Comparison with prior
studies would be helpful for further evaluation.
3. Splenic artery aneurism.
.
Echo ([**2130-3-27**]):
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is at least mild
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is at
least mildly depressed but images are suboptimal and EF could be
lower.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation
is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation
is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN.
Ms [**Known lastname 58650**] is a 60 year old woman with history of COPD,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus and schizophrenia who was
initially admitted to the medicine floor with a 6-day history
dyspnea, cough and fear of falling. On admission to the floor,
pt developed hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
intubation and transfer to the MICU.
.
1. Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to COPD exacerbation and
bilateral lower lobe pneumonia. Pt's oxygenation and dyspnea
initially improved with nebulizers, steroids, and antibiotics
given in the ED.  On arrival to the floor, pt was noted to
somnolent and barely able to open eyes to verbal stimuli. Pt was
noted to be in respiratory distress with O2 sats 83-89% on 6L nc
and RR of 51. She was tachycardic with HR 90-100s and BP
120-130s/60s. Given albuterol/atrovent nebs. ABG was 7.17/96/63.
Pt was transferred to the MICU. Brief trial of bipap for
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure was unsuccessful and pt
was electively intubated. In the unit, pt was continued on
around the clock albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. Pt was given
IV solumedrol. Pt was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for treatment of CAP/atypical pneumonia. Pt received IV lasix
for diuresis, for possible component of CHF. Echocardiogram
revealed mildly depressed EF of 40-45%, but not other
abnormalities. While intubated, pt's pulse O2 sats ranged from
90-94%, with paO2 range from 72-100; her hypoxia was consistent
with underlying COPD and new pna. On [**3-28**], pt had a bronchoscopy
for pulmonary toilet, because of secretions. Bronchoscopy was
normal without any secretions. Pt was successfully extubated on
[**3-28**]
