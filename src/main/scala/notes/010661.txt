Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation


History of Present Illness:
28 yo male with a history of left ventricular non-compaction,
ADHD, asthma, anxiety, allergic rhinitis, and FH of sudden death
at 47 who presented s/p VF arrest, down for estimated 6 minutes
at home prior to EMS arrival.

At outside hospital, there was some question regarding whether
or not patient might have had massive PE, so he was given bolus
of 10,000u heparin plus drip.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via
helicopter, intubated on epi + dopamine drips.

Patient was last hospitalized in [**10/2129**] at [**Hospital1 18**] when he
presented for increased DOE and was diagnosed by cardiac MRI
with left ventricular non-compaction, noted to have EF=20-30%.


Past Medical History:
 1. CARDIAC HISTORY:
Left Ventricular Non-compaction
Systolic Heart Failure (EF 20-30%)
.
2. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
-asthma
-ADHD
-dyspepsia
-allergic rhinitis


Social History:
(Per OMR records, could not confirm)
-Tobacco history: None.
-ETOH: None
-Illicit drugs: None
-Lives with mother and two cats. Works as a dishwasher.


Family History:
(Per OMR records)
His maternal grandmother died suddenly of "rheumatic heart
disease," though his mother questions the diagnosis since she
never had rheumatic fever. No family members have structural
heart disease. His mother endorses palpitations at times and had
a recent normal cardiac stress test. One of his aunts fainted in
church at 16.

Physical Exam:
Intubated and sedated.

Unable to examine, as patient arrested immediately upon transfer
to CCU.

Pertinent Results:
STAT LABS send during CPR on admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
28M with hx of left ventricular non-compaction transferred via
helicopter from outside hospital, intubated on heparin, dopamine
and epinephrine drips, for induced-hypothermia protocol s/p VF
arrest at home.

Immediately upon arrival to CCU, patient was noted to have
bradycardia and PEA arrest.  CPR was initiated immediately with
administration of epinephrine and atropine.  He went into VF and
was shocked a few times, then became asystolic.  Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation continued with chest compressions and
administration of epinephrine, atropine, calcium, magnesium.
Femoral venous and arterial lines were placed into right groin
emergently.  Lactate was 7, noted to be improved from 11 at
outside hospital s/p initial VF arrest.  CPR was continued for a
total of about 50 minutes, and patient was pronounced dead at
10:45am.  His mother was in the waiting room and aware.

Arterial blood gases were very abnormal, suggesting very little
possibility of regaining brain function should patient have
survived the resuscitation: PaO2 was <30 and PCO2 was >100,
similar to values at the outside hospital.  Difficulty with
oxygenation and ventilation suggested to medical team that
patient may have experienced a massive Pulmonary Embolism at
home which could have caused his initial arrest rather than his
LV non-compaction, which was presumed to be the cause of his
initial arrest.  He had been started on heparin drip at the
outside hospital after a 10,000u bolus.  Patient was seen by
medical examiner for a post-mortem.
