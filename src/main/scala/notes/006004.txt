malaise and abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
79 yo F end stage renal dz, htn, hypothroid, hld who presents
with 5-6 days of N/V and diarrhea. Per daughter pt is not at
baseline and has been having hallucinations "someone trying to
shoot her." She also decribed increasing cough above her
baseline that is non-productive. She has also been feeling that
she is weak all over and more confused with some difficulty
walking. She also complains of whole body aches. She was unable
to go to dialysis today (usually TThSa) because she felt too
weak. Her daughter is a nurse and provides most of the history,
she lives with her son and is normally very indepdent. She
continues to make some urine. Subjective fevers at home. She has
been having increasing difficulty swallowing per family and
coughs frequently when taking PO. She denies any current CP, HA,
brbpr, or hemetemesis, difficulty swallowing/difficulty taking
PO.

In the ED, initial VS were: 19:30 98 78 154/82 18 99% RA. The
patient remained afebrile with HR in the 60s-70s. Her Blood
pressure emained elevated around 150s/80s. She remained >97% O2
saturation. One 18g and one 22g were placed. She remained alert
and oriented x3. She has a fistula in her L arm.

Her initial exam was reportedly notable only for crackles in the
lungs, but a repeat exam revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Thus, the patient underwent CT abdomen and pelvis, which did not
reveal acute pathology. She also was felt to have a swollen leg,
and so underwent CTA, which did not show PE. Her CXR did not
show a clear source of infection. Bedside echo was reportedly
without signs of cardiogenic shock.

The patient received Vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl, 500ml NS,
[**Doctor Last Name **]-dextro, thiamine.

Nephrology was consulted for HD, and were aware of dye load
given with CTA.

She was found to have an elevated lactate in the ED, which
increased to 5.6 but then began to trend down to 5.0 with IVF
(she got 1800cc total). She also had a gap of 18. The patient
was noted to also have a normal chemistry otherwise except for
her elevated creatinine. She had a slight leukocytosis with
normal differential. Her hematocrit and platelets were normal.
She did have a slight elevation in her ALT and AST, her INR was
elevated to 1.4. Her troponin was elevated to 0.04 with normal
CK/MB. UA was obtained.  A RIJ was placed and was oozing.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient says that she feels well,
she says that she feels much better than prior.

In speaking to her daughter, she brought her into the hospital
for concern for weakness, deconditioned. Unable to eat.
Forgetting her dialysis day. Hallucinating. The patient is in
the middle of moving from one apartment to another. The cough is
nagging and constant, the daughter says that this interferes
with her sleep. She endorsed coughing to the point of vomiting.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
ECG: NSR @ 67 bpm, leftward axis and LAFB, LAA, LVH, TWI
laterally, flattened Ts II, poor R-wave progression. Compared to
ECG from [**2134**], appears similar.

[**2136-10-2**] CHEST X-RAY:  Consistent with pulmonary vascular
congestion.
Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged.  Prominence of the pulmonary
arteries is stable.  There is mild left base streaky
atelectasis/scarring.  There is minimal pulmonary vascular
congestion.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  No large pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

[**2136-10-3**] CHEST X-RAY:
IMPRESSION:  Status post right IJ central line placement without
evidence of complication; worsening heart failure.

[**2136-10-3**] ECHO: Mildly dilated LA and moderately dilated RA.
Estimated RA pressure at least 15 mmHg. LV size borderline
dilated. LV systoli function severely depressed (LVEF 20%) with
akinesis of the apex and distal LV segments and moderate
hypokinesis remaining seg. Moderate LV thrombus seen. RV mildly
dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis. Mod-severe MR and
mod-severe TR. Severe PA sys
