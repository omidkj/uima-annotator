Brief Hospital Course:
Since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she developed a fever on [**4-3**] so her
a-line and central line were replaced.  She went to the OR for
stenting on [**4-4**].  A Y-stent was placed to her trachea at the
carina and the end of the trach was placed into the end of it.
On [**4-5**] she [**Hospital **] transferred to the Medical ICU for further
management.
.
# Respiratory failure/Tracheobronchial malacia: s/p y-stenting
[**4-5**], although there is some remaining segments proximally and
distally that have malacia.  She was switched from PCV
ventilation to pressure support on [**4-6**].  She tolerated this
well and was slowly weaned.  On transfer to MICU for patient was
on four agents (ativan, phenobarb, fentynyl and propofol) for
sedation.  Propofol and ativan were discontinued.  Fentynyl
patch was applied with goal of decreasing the fentynyl gtt.
Phenobarb was also decreased with goal of using fentynyl or
versed for sedation.  Phenobarb was at 60mg IV BID on transfer
and was weaned slowly with goal of decreasing 10mg per day. On
[**4-9**] however, pt was tachypneic and did not tolerate PS
ventilation which was thought to be secondary to too rapid of
weaning of sedatives.  Pt was placed back on AC and increased
fentanyl patch to 100mcg and restarted Versed.  On discharge,
she was on Fentanly 50mcg and Versed 2mg. Plan was to continue
to wean down with addition of Halidol 2.5mg TID for agitation.
.
# Fevers/bacteremia:  Pt had history of MRSA and klebsiella
pneumonias.  While in the SICU she had temperature spike she was
pancultured and central line was changed.  One sputum culture
with showed MRSA.  She also had blood cultures with enterococcus
(sensitive to vanc) and coag negative staph. These were thought
to be contaminants. She was started on Vancomycin [**2168-4-2**].  She
remained afebrile in the medical ICU with ocassional low grade
temp.  Her Arterial line was discontinued.  She should be
treated for total 10 days with Vancomycin and the last dose to
be on [**4-12**]. She continues to have a left subclavian.
.
# h/o DVT: on coumadin at home, unclear when the DVT was
diagnosed.  She had a upper extremity DVT on [**4-6**] which showed
no growth.  She was continued on heparin gtt and this was
maintained with goal PTT 60-85.  She should be restarted on
coumadin.
.
# Pulmonary nodules: CXray showed mediastinal mass and so had a
Chest CT which showed Right lobe pulm nodules and mediastinal
LAD. Needs further w/u with PET/CT, FNAC. PPD placed on [**4-11**] @
2:30PM - needs follow up.
.
# Endocrine: Sliding scale insulin.
# Access: Left subclavian central line
# PPX: PPI, on heparin gtt.
