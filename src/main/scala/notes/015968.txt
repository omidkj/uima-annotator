Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 38208**] COMPLAINT:  Weakness

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   76-year-old white male with a
history of symptomatic bradycardia status post pacemaker,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease,
weakness over the last three to four weeks.  The patient has
a complicated cardiac history.  He was hospitalized in
[**2144-10-28**] for an acute thrombosis of the left anterior
descending.  The patient was seen earlier that week for an
episode of near-syncope, was seen the following week in
clinic by his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] in the clinic,
he stated that since his pre-syncopal episode, he had felt
fibrillation arrest and was resuscitated and brought to the
Coronary Care Unit.  While in the Coronary Care Unit, his
enzymes were positive and, shortly afterwards, he was taken
to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  The
catheterization revealed near-total occlusion of his proximal
left anterior descending and thrombus at the site of
occlusion.  The lesion was successfully stented with 0%
residual stenosis.  There were no other identifiable lesions
in the left anterior descending.  There was 50 to 60%
stenosis of the obtuse marginal I.  The right coronary artery
showed minor irregularities in the proximal third.

Shortly after catheterization, the patient suffered from
another episode of ventricular fibrillation, and then was
successfully cardioverted, but then developed respiratory
distress and was intubated for cardiogenic shock.
Echocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of
25% with anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis.  He was
intubated for over a month and required a tracheostomy.
While intubated, his pacemaker was replaced with an ICD
[**Company 1543**] Model #7273.  Eventually, after a prolonged
hospital Coronary Care Unit stay, he was extubated and
underwent intensive cardiac rehabilitation.

Since his Coronary Care Unit admission, he has suffered from
the following events:  In [**2146-9-29**], while in [**Location (un) 86**],
he had an episode of ventricular fibrillation for which he
was shocked.  His defibrillator detection rate was
reprogrammed from 188 to 167 beats per minute.  He has lost
70 or 80 pounds, and continues to lose weight.  He went from
247 to 170 pounds.  His ACE inhibitor was discontinued for
suspected cough, and his beta blocker discontinued for
asymptomatic hypotension.  Over the last three to four weeks,
he has noted increased weakness.  He has been playing golf
fairly recently, but is no longer able to play.  He becomes
short of breath after walking a quarter of a mile, according
to him.  He denies any chest pain.  He also has been having
pain in his left shoulder, left upper chest, which was
attributed to him lying in bed on that side.  He notes that
he has awakened in the middle of the night short of breath.
He has also required a variable height of pillows on which to
sleep.  He denies any fevers or chills.  He denies any nausea
or vomiting.  He has had problems with constipation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, possibly Type 2
diabetes.  Since his myocardial infarction, he reports that
his glucose is on the low side, and he has not required any
insulin.  His fasting glucose has been around 120 to 130.
Last hemoglobin A1c was 6.16.
2.  Coronary artery disease as above
3.  Symptomatic bradycardia; pacemaker was placed in [**2122**] and
was later replaced in [**2130**], which was then replaced with a
[**Company 1543**] ICD Model #7273.
4.  Hypothyroidism, previously on Synthroid, reason for
discontinuing it is not known
5.  Hyperlipidemia, last profile in [**2146-7-30**] with
LDL 93, HDL 53, triglycerides 135
6.  Gout
7.  Small bowel obstruction from previous hernia repairs
8.  Peripheral neuropathy
9.  Glaucoma
10. Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.3

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Denies smoking.  Occasional ethanol.  He
lives in [**State 108**] with his wife, visiting the [**Name (NI) 86**] area
because granddaughter is graduating.  He has 2 sons and 1
daughter, and 10 grandchildren.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died at 51 from a myocardial
infarction.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin, dose regularly adjusted for atrial
fibrillation, receives 2.5 mg for five days, then 1.5 mg for
two days, specifically on Monday and Wednesday
2.  Prilosec 20 mg by mouth once daily.
He has been discontinued from many medications, including
Lanoxin, Vasotec, Atacand, Synthroid, lasix, Toprol XL,
Claritin and Singulair.

ALLERGIES:   Questionable Tequin reaction.  Additionally, he
was stopped also from amiodarone and Lipitor because of
elevated liver function tests but unclear which medication
caused the reaction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   General:  Elderly gentleman with cardiac
cachexia and obvious volume overload.  Dyspneic with speaking but
able to
complete sentences.  Heart rate 60, blood pressure 128/60,
respiratory rate 20.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact,
pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation,
moist mucous membranes.  Neck supple without thyromegaly, jugular
venous distention to angle of jaw. no lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary:  No wheezes or crackles appreciated.  Cardiac
displace PMI
S1, split S2, S3 and systolic murmur.  Abdomen:  Normal bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, palpable liver edge.  His abdomen was
distended in the
lower portions.  He has a history of hernia.  Extremities:
2+ lower extremity pitting edema up to thighs and presacral
edema. Neurological: Alert,
awake, oriented x 3.

LABORATORY DATA:   White count 5.5, hematocrit 42.7,
platelets 146, MCV 89, neutrophils 65.3, lymphocytes 25.4,
monocytes .8, eosinophils .6, basophils .4.  INR 1.4, PTT
31.2. Cholesterol 141, triglycerides 72, LDL 88, HDL 39, TSH
43.7, free T4 1.3.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 29, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose 119.  ALT 10,
AST 19, albumin 3.7, phosphate 3.8, alkaline phosphatase
________, total bilirubin 1.0, calcium 9.1.  Helicobacter
pylori negative.  Urinalysis with trace blood, greater than
300 protein, 1.025 specific gravity, pH 5.  Troponin was less
than .3.  Magnesium 1.9, phosphate 4.1, calcium 9.1.

Chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with slight upper zone
redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature, without evidence
of interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema.  Mild blunting
of the left costophrenic angle and increased densities within
both major fissures on the lateral view, indicating pleural
thickening in these areas.  Small pleural effusions present.
These findings were consistent with chronic congestive heart
failure.  There was demineralization of the osseous
structures, but no evidence of compression fractures within
the thoracic spine.  Dual lead defibrillator/cardiac pacer is
seen with the generator overlying the left hemithorax.

Electrocardiogram shows paced rhythm with a left bundle
branch block pattern.  Echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 15%.

Stress Thallium showed moderate defect involving the anterior and
septal walls.  There was severe perfusion defect involving the
cardiac apex.  However, the test was stopped because of Thallium
pickup in the lungs.  No exercise stress test was done.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   76-year-old white male with a history
of coronary artery disease, symptomatic bradycardia status
post pacemaker, ventricular fibrillation arrest, now comes
with progressive deterioration of exercise tolerance and
increase in dyspnea on exertion plus symptoms of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema and was found to
be in decompensated heart failure.  He was admitted for
treatment of his congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Cardiac ischemia:  The patient was felt to be in
decompensated heart failure secondary to a discontinuation in his
medications as well as possibly from an ischemic event.  His
troponin was negative,
therefore he didn't have any event in the last week or so.  He
was not started on a beta blocker because he
