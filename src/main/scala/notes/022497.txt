Date of Birth:   [**2132-7-11**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 27-year-old
female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I x18 years
and hypercholesterolemia who presented with chest pain.  The
patient reported that one week ago she started experiencing
epigastric pain after eating which she thought might be
indigestion.  A few days prior to her admission, the patient
reports pain changed in quality from burning to pressure or
tightness in the chest.  She had this at rest and was worse
with inspiration and exertion.  She is experiencing shortness
of breath, but denies any nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
She also denied any recent fevers or upper respiratory tract
symptoms.  She went to [**Hospital **] Clinic for her routine diabetes
follow up and she was then sent to the Emergency Room for
further evaluation.  In the Emergency Room, electrocardiogram
showed ST depressions and T-wave inversions in 1, 2, F, V4
through V6.  She received aspirin, Lopressor and intravenous
nitroglycerin GGT.  A transthoracic echocardiogram showed
ejection fraction of 25% with global hypokinesis, troponin of
3.2, CK of 275 and an MB of 5.  She was admitted to the
cardiac service for work up of her cardiac event.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type I x18 years
2.  Hypercholesterolemia

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin U-500 20 units q a.m., 26 q p.m.
2.  Sliding scale with U-100
3.  Glucophage 500 mg po bid
4.  Lipitor 20 mg po qd
5.  Zestril 40 mg po qd

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco, alcohol, or
drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's grandmother died at age 64
from coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's temperature is 98.9??????, heart rate
87, blood pressure 112/54, respiratory rate 12, O2 saturation
95% on 2 liters.  The patient weighs 93 kg.
GENERAL:  The patient is in no acute distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  No jugular venous
distention.
LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Obese, soft and nontender with no masses.
RECTUM:  Heme negative.  There is 1+ edema at the ankles.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  White count of 7.4, hematocrit 40.2,
platelets 297.  PT 12.7, PTT 22.4, INR 1.1.  Sodium 142,
potassium 3.9, chloride 104, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14,
creatinine 0.8, glucose of 118.  CK 275, MB 5, troponin I
3.2.  She was beta HCG negative.

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a
rate of 110 with inferior lateral ST changes suggestive of
myocardial injury.  Chest x-ray showed heart size upper
limits of normal, otherwise normal.  Echocardiogram on [**2160-4-29**]
significant for severe global hypokinesis, mild mitral
regurgitation with ejection fraction of 25%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiology
service.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
hospital day #1.  This was significant for RCA stenosis of
70% and LAD stenosis of 90% and OM1 stenosis of 80% and OM2
stenosis of 60%.

The patient tolerated this procedure well, was stabilized on
aspirin, nitroglycerin drip, Zestril and a heparin drip.
Hospital day #2, the patient was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] for elevated
blood glucose level resistant to insulin sliding scale.  The
patient was started on insulin drip for better glucose
control.  The patient was then seen by cardiothoracic surgery
and evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting.

On hospital day #3, the patient was taken to the Operating
Room where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and the cardiothoracic team.  The grafts were
left internal mammary artery to LAD, left radial to OM,
supraventricular tachycardia to AM and supraventricular
tachycardia to diagonal.  The patient tolerated this
procedure well.  She underwent an EVH on the right thigh with
hybrid skip of the right calf.  She was transferred to the
cardiothoracic surgery Intensive Care Unit stable on propofol
and nitroglycerin drip.  The patient postoperatively has
remained stable.  The patient was extubated without incident.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable although the
first postoperative night remained tachycardic.  The patient
was managed with intervascular expansion with Hespan and
heart rate responded appropriately.  The patient was weaned
of all drips.  Hematocrit was stable at 22.  The patient had
episode of chest tightness on postoperative day #1.
Echocardiogram was performed which was significant for
improvement in inferior wall motion compared to the previous
study on [**2160-4-29**].  The patient continued to remain
hemodynamically stable.  Electrocardiogram showed no
significant changes.

On postoperative day #3, the patient continued to remain
afebrile and hemodynamically stable and was transferred to
the floor for the remainder of her recovery.  The patient was
seen by physical therapy and this is currently a level 5
activity.  Hematocrits remained stable with the last
hematocrit being 24.  The chest tube, wires and Foley were
discontinued without incident.  Her blood glucose levels have
been followed by the [**Hospital **] Clinic, has remained in the 100s
to 200s.  The patient has been restarted on her fixed U-500
insulin dose in a sliding scale [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  The patient is
tolerating a cardiac diet.  Wounds remain clean, dry and
intact.  The patient stable, now ready for discharge home
with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks and follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

bypass graft x4
