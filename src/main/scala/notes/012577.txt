Hematemesis

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 78W with history of MPD, HTN, DM2, ESRD on HD, depression,
and AF on anticoagulation who presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
w/large UGIB but has designated code status as DNR/DNI.  The
patient was admitted to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**2166-3-31**] following an
admission to [**Hospital1 882**] for left leg hematoma with INR 19 s/p
fasciotomy [**2166-2-22**] which was c/b DVT in hematoma for which she
was restarted on coumadin and underwent repeat surgery [**2166-3-24**].
Since discharge she had been doing well until this morning when
noted to have 200cc bright red emesis with blood clots. She has
noted at the Rehab to have poor po intake for days without a
bowel movement in five days. In the ED, she dropped her sat sto
84%, was put on high flow O2.  [**12-26**] large amt of hematemesis, she
received 2-3L of fluid in the ED.
.
She says that she has been sick long enough and does not wish
escalation of care.  She specifically refuses cpr, intubation,
EGD, interventional lines, embolization but does want dialysis
and blood-products in the short term.  If her GIB does not
resolve quickly, she wishes to have comfort the main goal of
care, including discontinuation of HD and blood products.  Two
sisters are present at interview who agree, but express concern
about the patient's son or husband interfering with her wishes.

Pertinent Labs/Studies:
.
Imaging:
[**2166-4-7**]: Portable Chest - 1.  No significant change in the upper
lung zone pulmonary vascular redistribution and slight perihilar
haziness which is consistent with mild congestive heart failure.

2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
.
[**2166-4-9**]: Portable Chest - IMPRESSION:  Resolved pulmonary edema.
.
[**2166-4-11**]: Portable Chest - IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation and
placement of PICC.  Atelectasis at the right lung base and right
middle lobe.  Aspiration cannot be excluded.
.
[**2166-4-11**]: RUE US - IMPRESSION:  No DVT in right upper extremity.
.
[**2166-4-12**]: Portable - IMPRESSION:  Possible early failure.
.
[**2166-4-14**]: FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a
left-sided dialysis catheter with the tip terminating just below
the cavoatrial junction. A left-sided PICC is in stable
position.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is worsened
pulmonary edema.  There has been development of a right-sided
pleural effusion and a tiny left-sided pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
2.  Worsened pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions,
greater on the right side.
.
[**2166-4-18**]: There is continued mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.  There is
slight improvement of the bibasilar patchy atelectasis.
The left-sided PICC line and left jugular IV catheter remain in
place.  No pneumothorax is identified.
There is continued tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with
calcification.
.
[**2166-4-20**]: CT lower extremity - There are two large heterogeneous
fluid
collections with areas of high attenuation involving the
anterior and medial thigh consistent with hematomas.  The
largest collection involving the anterior medial thigh located
in or just deep to the sartorius muscle measures 17 x 8 x 5 cm
(craniocaudad, transverse, AP).  The collection more superiorly
centered within the tensor fascia lata measures 6 x 5 x 3 cm.
(craniocaudad, transverse, AP).  There are no air bubbles in the
collection or other specific CT signs to suggest superinfection
though this cannot be excluded. Surrounding osseous structures
demonstrate no evidence of destruction or secondary signs of
osteomyelitis.  The bones are normally mineralized.  There is
mild subcutaneous edema diffusely.  Incidental note is made of
rectal tube. The visualized pelvic contents are unremarkable
with the exception of sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis. Diffuse vascular calcification is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:  Two large hematomas as described above centered in
the left
tensor fascia lata and just deep to the sartorius muscle.  No
air is seen in these collections, however superinfection is not
excluded.
.
[**2166-4-23**]: Portable Chest - IMPRESSION:  No change in pulmonary
vascular congestion.
.
[**2166-4-24**]: Successful placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter
