.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The inferior vena cava is
dilated (>2.5
cm). The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Tissue
velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include with
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-21**],
left ventricular function now appears improved. Of note, patient
in sinus rhythm for the current study (in aflutter with rapid
ventricular response in prior study).
.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old M with CAD, CHF, polysubtance abuse and prior GI
bleed presents with 3 days of melena, BRBPR, hematemesis
associated with chest pain and shortness of breath.  Hospital
course by problem:
.
# Hypertensive emergency: Patient came in with SBP in the 200s.
This was thought to be [**2-15**] poor med compliance and cocaine use
recently.  His blood pressure was initially controlled with a
labetalol drip but he was switched to his home regimen shortly
into his stay.  We treated him with isosorbide dinitrate 10mg
TID and carvedilol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  His SBP was 120-140 throughout
the rest of his stay.
.
# Anemia: Patient had a HCT of 20 on admission in the setting of
hematemesis.  He received 2 units of PRBCs in the ED then was
transferred to the MICU.  He never experienced hypotension.  He
received another 3u PRBCs and his HCT stabilized between 27-30.
He had an EGD which showed no active bleeding but multiple AVMs.
 We controlled his blood pressure and the patient did not
experience any further drop in his HCT.  He was placed on an IV
PPI [**Hospital1 **] and was switched to PO BID upon discharge.  We also
started sucralfate and continued it upon discharge.
.
# Cards Vascular: The patient experienced chest pain during his
stay.  His troponins trended as above with a peak of 0.15.  His
CKMB remained flat and in the setting of acute renal failure we
did not believe he was undergoing ACS.  His chest pain was
nonexertional and it was associated with point tenderness.  It
was primarily located on the right side of his chest without
radiation.  We treated him with dilaudid and switched him to
tylenol upon discharge.  An echo done on [**10-3**] showed resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include with
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis and an EF of 40-45%.  We
continued to control his blood pressure, started aspirin, and
treated him with a beta blocker and a statin.  We encouraged the
avoidance of cocaine upon discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure:  The patient has a baseline Creatinine of
2.5-2.7.  His Cr was 3.2 on admission and was 3.6 upon
discharge.  His ARF was thought secondary to
hypoperfusion/ischemia/intrinsic renal disease.  We hydrated him
without much improvement in his Cr.  We continued to treat with
PhosLo and calcitriol during his stay.
.
# Diabetes type II.  The patient was hyperglycemic in the ED.
We resumed his home doses of NPH and used humalog sliding scale
for breakthrough.  He was seen by the [**Last Name (un) **] team who made some
recommendations to his management.  He has followup with [**Last Name (un) **]
soon after discharge.
.
# Alcohol abuse/substance abuse: We started a CIWA scale and
counseled the patient on the importance of changing his habits.
We consulted the social worker but the patient refused the
intervention.
.
# Left eye vision changes: Unclear etiology. Patient has known
DMII and this may represent some microvascular disease.  The
ophthmo team was consulted and recommended followup through
[**Last Name (un) **].
