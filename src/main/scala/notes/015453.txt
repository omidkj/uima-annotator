Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68548**] is a 68M with h/o COPD (on 3L home O2), CAD,
hepatitis B&C, and an FDG avid RLL mass concerning for
malignancy who presented to the ED from Stone [**Hospital **] Rehab on
[**6-30**] with mental status changes.  Specifically, it was reported
that the patient has been becoming more lethargic over 3 days.
The patient's HCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2563**] [**Name (NI) 1661**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 68549**]) was contact[**Name (NI) **]
who given a history that the patient has had an increasing
number of falls at his rehab facility recently.  She does not
know the cause of the falls or if there have been complications.
 Further, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital
on [**2155-6-14**] with PNA and bacteremia Tx'ed with levaquin and
course ended [**2155-6-26**]. During this hospitalization, he was
found to have a LLL infiltrate thought to be consistent with
pneumonia. He was started on vancomycin and zosyn since he
described a history of aspiration and had multiple pulmonary
co-morbidities. Blood cultures yielded gram positive cocci in
clusters that later grew out coagulase negative staph that
speciated as Staph hominus. He was switched to levofloxacin with
end date of [**2155-6-26**]. In addition, he had altered mental status
on admission, which rapidly improved to his baseline with
administration of Narcan in the ER. He continued on a pain
regimen.

In addition, ECHO showed diastolic heart failure (EF 60 %).

.
In the ED, the patient was unable to provide a history and was
noted to be mumbling and unable to state his own name.  Sats
initially in the low 80s on RA and improved to 93% on non
rebreather. CXR showed large left sided consolidation on CXR.
Labs significant for WBC 7.3, Hgb 10 (down 11.8), Cr 4.9
(baseline Cr 0.7). His mental status and oxygenation
deteroriated prompting intubation. After intubation, he became
hypotensive to 77/40. A CVL was placed in R IJ. He was given 5L
of fluids and started on vanc/zosyn/levofloxacin. Neosenephrine
was started. He was transferred to the MICU for further
management of ? sepsis. He received a total of 5 L NS.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient's intial vitals were 98.1
110/54 79. He remained intubated on neosenephrine. He was
sedated and unable to provide further history.

On Discharge:

Studies:
[**6-30**] CT Chest-1. Multifocal opacities with air bronchograms,
including complete consolidation/atelectasis of the left lower
lobe. Differential considerations include pneumonic
consolidations or extensive atelectasis. 2. Mass in the right
lower lobe, compatible with known suspected malignancy. 3.
Similar slight left adrenal thickening without discrete nodules.


[**6-30**] CT Head. IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial
process. Scattered periventricular white matter hypodensities,
grossly unchanged, which most likely represent sequela of mild
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. MR would be significantly
more sensitive for detection of intracranial metastases, if
clinically indicated.

[**7-1**] Echo. The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets are not well
seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen but cannot exclude (views are suboptimal).


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68548**] is a 68 y/o male with PMH COPD, CAD, hepatitis B&C
and questionable lung cancer presents with altered mental status
and hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of PNA

# PNA
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on
[**2155-6-14**] with PNA and bacteremia (Staph hominus). Tx'ed with
levaquin and course ended [**2155-6-26**].  On [**2155-6-30**] he presented
to this hospital with AMS and lethargy. In the ED, the patient
was unable to provide a history and was noted to be mumbling and
unable to state his own name. Sats initially in the low 80s on
RA and improved to 93% on non rebreather. A CXR revealed a LLL
consolidation in addition to known right sided lung mass. His
mental status and oxygenation deteroriated prompting intubation.
After intubation, he became hypotensive to 77/40. A CVL was
placed in R IJ. He was given 5L of fluids and started on
vanc/zosyn/levofloxacin. Pressors were started.  A CT C/A/P
showed the left sided consolidation and a right sided mass
measuring 30 x 22 mm.  He was transferred to the MICU where he
was slowly weaned from pressors.  A TTE done showed an EF of 55%
and no vegitations although was a suboptimal study.  A
bronchoscopy was performed and cultures taken which grew MRSA.
Antibiotics narrowed to just vancomycin. On [**7-2**], the patient
passed an SBT and was extubated w/o complications.  A PICC was
placed on [**7-5**], with plan for 14 days of antibiotic therapy to
end on the night of [**2155-7-13**]. Patient back to baseline and doing
well on Vancomycin.

# Hypotension
The patient was initially normotensive in th ED.  Following
intubation, his BP fell to the 70s/40s and he required pressors.
 On transfer to the MICU, his pressors were able to be weaned
off slowly.  Most likely etiology of hypotension is sedating
medications for intubation. Vasodilation from sepsis also a
possible expla
