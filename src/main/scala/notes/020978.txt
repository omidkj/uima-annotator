ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Abdominal pain

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Mitral valve regurgitation
2.  Congestive heart failure
3.  Status post mitral valve repair

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year old
black woman who reported sudden onset of abdominal pain
approximately one week ago.  Abdominal pain has been steadily
worsening and the patient reports no change in bowel
symptoms.  The patient has had a decrease in appetite and
sudden increase in shortness of breath.  The pain is
epigastric in nature and crampy.  The patient was admitted
for workup of her abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Morbid obesity; 2.  Asthma; 3.
Hypertension; 4.  Heart murmur; 5.  Myocardial infarction in
[**2098**]; 6.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of 35
to 40% by echocardiogram in [**2105-8-26**]; 7.  Irregular
menses.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Iron supplement.  2.  Flovent
2 puffs b.i.d.; 3.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.; 4.  Univasc 15 mg
q.d.; 5.  Medroxyprogesterone approximately one month ago for
uterine bleeding.

ALLERGIES:  Ibuprofen causes dyspnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is a middle-aged black
woman in no acute distress.  Vital signs are as follows -
Temperature 96.7, heartrate 96, blood pressure 155/91, 99% on
room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat is atraumatic,
normocephalic.  Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light.  Anicteric.  Throat is clear.
Neck, supple, midline without masses or lymphadenopathy.  The
chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular,
regular rate and rhythm with Grade II/VI holosystolic
ejection murmur.  The abdomen is soft, mildly distended,
nontender, with no masses or organomegaly, obese.
Extremities are warm, noncyanotic, with 2+ lower extremity
edema, prominent chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally.
Rectal examination is guaiac negative per Emergency
Department staff.  Neurological is grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed
complete blood count 5.9/39.2/223.  PT was 12.7, INR 1.1, PTT
23.5.  Urinalysis was negative.  Chemistries,
142/4.0/109/22/20/0.9/115.  ALT 178, AST 91, alkaline
phosphatase 115, total bilirubin 0.6, amylase 53, lipase 40.
Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase 110, troponin less than
0.3.

Admission electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 95.
No significant abnormalities.  Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly
with prominent interstitial markings, no free air in the
diaphragm.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound shows grossly
normal liver with no ductal dilatation, no stones.
Gallbladder wall is slightly edematous, but there were no
other overt signs of cholecystitis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for evaluation of
her vague abdominal pain as well as worsening of her
shortness of breath.  The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial cardiac enzymes.  Evaluation of her
shortness of breath with her history of congestive heart
failure eventually yielded catheterization.  Cardiac
catheterization showed an ejection fraction of approximately
35% with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.  There was
also noted to be a right coronary artery system with only
mild disease of the left anterior descending and left
circumflex.  The patient did also have an elevated left
ventricular end diastolic pressure.  Thoracic Surgery was
called to evaluate the patient and per the patient's severe
mitral regurgitation the patient was taken to the Operating
Room on [**2107-3-9**].  At that time she had a mitral
valve repair which she tolerated well.  In the postoperative
period she was taken to the CSRU for closure monitoring.  The
patient was extubated on the evening of postoperative day #0.
The patient was begun on Amiodarone drip for some occasional
ectopy.  The Heart Failure Service was consulted for the
patient's congestive heart failure.  ACE inhibitor was
increased as tolerated and the patient was actively and
aggressively diuresed.  Milrinone was weaned off.  On
postoperative day #3, the patient's chest tubes were
discontinued and invasive monitoring was also discontinued.
The patient otherwise had a fairly unremarkable course and
was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #6.  Her
main issues again remained active diuresis as well as
increasing of her ACE inhibitor.  The patient was begun on
Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d. but did not tolerate this over a 24
hour period with worsening of shortness of breath.  This is
felt to be likely due to her underlying asthma.  Lopressor
was discontinued and Captopril was again increased.  The
patient was then subsequent transfused 1 unit of blood on the
evening of postoperative day #7.  This was done for a
hematocrit of 28.8 and congestive heart failure.  Ultimately
the patient was discharged on postoperative day #8 tolerating
a regular diet, adequate pain control and p.o. pain
medications and having been cleared for home discharge by
Physical Therapy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIET:  Cardiac and diabetic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. times seven days
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. times seven days
3.  Percocet 5/325 one to two q. 4 hours prn
4.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
5.  Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d.
6.  Albuterol 1 to 2 puffs q. 4 hours prn
7.  Flovent 110 mcg  2 puffs b.i.d.
8.  Captopril 75 mg t.i.d.
9.  Niferex 150 mg b.i.d.
10. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is sent home with
[**Hospital6 407**].  She is encouraged to continue
working actively with physical therapy at home.  She should
follow up with her cardiologist in one to two weeks time to
adjust diuresis as well as adjustment of cardiac medications
at that time.  The patient should follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks time.
