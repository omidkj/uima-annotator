History of Present Illness:
78 year-old Mandarin-speaking female with history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, amiodarone induced pulmonary fibrosis
and CHF (EF on [**First Name3 (LF) **] 55% with apical hypokinesis and 2+ MR in
[**2-16**]) who presented to the ED with diarrhea for 8 days. She
noted a sudden onset of the diarrhea with no inciting events.
She made no recent dietary changes and had no recent sick
contacts. She had no nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills. She
noted blood on the toilet tissue but none in the bowl. Her VNA
found her to be hypotensive and sent her to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 98.3, HR 76, BP 94/57, RR
18, O2 Sat99. She received 3L of NS. A CT scan revealed mild
colitis. She received Flagyl and Ciprofloxacin in the ED. (*Of
note, an incidental pulmonary nodule was detected at the right
lung base.*) A reaction developed at the site of Ciprofloxacin
infusion and she was switched to Ceftriaxone upon transfer to
the MICU. She was still hypotensive in the MICU and received
further IVF.
.
The patient was transfered to the medicine team the following
day ([**8-23**]). On transfer, the vital signs were T:97.0, HR:95,
BP:108/60, RR:18, SO2:96% on RA.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old Mandarin-speaking female with CHF,
amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and AF on coumadin
admitted with colitis and hypotension.
.
1. Colitis: A bacterial etiology was assumed on admission given
the duration of the diarrhea. Empirirc antibiotics, Ceftriaxone
and Metronidazole, were initated with coverage for C. diff.
Blood, urine and stool cultures (including C. diff toxin) were
sent. Patient was C. diff toxin negative. In the initial course
of her illness she reported close to 10 bowel movements per day.
On admission she was only have 3 per day. Antibiotics were not
continued upon transfer from the MICU to the medicine floor. The
patient had one bowel movement per day while on the medicine
service but no further diarrhea. ** A repeat C. diff toxin and
stool cultures were pending at the time of discharge. Blood
cultures were negative to date. Patient has GI follow-up as she
has never had a colonoscopy.**
.
2. Hypotension: Patient received approximately 3.6L NS in the ED
and MICU. Patient was normotensive on transfer to the medicine
service and required no further intravenous fluid resuscitation.
.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 2.1 on admission but returned to
baseline of 1.0 following intravenous fluid resuscitation. No
urine studies were pursued given fluid response and likelihood
of prerenal etiology in the face of severe volume depletion.
.
4. Heart Failure with Preserved EF: EF 55% in [**2-16**]. Patient's
Furosemide, Metoprolol and Valsartan were held in the setting of
hypotension and acute kidney injury. Patient was euvolemic at
discharge and restarted on home medications.
.
5. Anemia: Baseline hematocrit mid- to high-30s in months prior
to admission. Patient has never received colonoscopy. No
evaluation pursued during this admission but patient was
scheduled with gastroenterology follow-up.
.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on Coumadin for anticoagulation
and Metoprolol tartrate for rate  control. Metoprolol was
initially held in the setting of hypovolemia and rate remained
within normal limits. Metoprolol was restarted once euvolemic.
INR 3.4 on admission. Coumadin was held until INR less than 3
and was reinitiated. Patient followed by [**Hospital 197**] clinic as an
outpatient.
.
7. Solitary Pulmonary Nodule: 5-mm pulmonary nodule in the right
lung base detected on abdominal CT. Patient was a smoker at one
point in her life but reported different pack-year histories. Of
note, patient was reported to have Amiodarone-induced pulmonary
fibrosis. ** Patient will need follow-up as an outpatient. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines, a followup chest CT at 12 months is
recommended if there are no risk factors. If there are risk
factors, then initial followup CT at 6 to 12 months is
recommended. **
