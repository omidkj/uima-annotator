Pertinent Results:
[**2183-1-13**] PORTABLE CXR:  0.89 cm opacity overlying the lower
medial right lung zone.  This finding could be external to the
patient and could be reevaluated on followup chest radiograph.
Left lower lobe linear atelectasis.
.
[**2183-1-13**] EKG: v-paced at 69 beats per minute, left axis, ST
depressions in I and avL, (no comparisons)
.
CT chest:
IMPRESSION: 1) 8.0cm right lower lobe mass or abscess. Although
the associated small to moderate pleural effusion is mobile, the
presence of pleural thickening both close to and remote from the
mass as well as extensive mediastinal adenopathy and a 1 cm left
adrenal nodule are suggestive of malignant spread. 2) Moderate
to severe emphysema. 3) Severe atherosclerosis, coronary, aortic
and abdominal. 4) Chronic cholelithiasis.
5) Small, hypervascular left renal lesion. 6) Interatrial
lipoma.
.
CT Chest FNA:
IMPRESSION: Successful CT guided FNA of right lower lobe mass.
Core needle biopsy was not performed at this time due to the
patient's recent aspirin use and elevated INR. If clinically
indicated, this can be performed once the patient's coagulopathy
has resolved.

The attending Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was present and assisted
throughout the procedure.
.
FNA lung mass:
 POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
  Consistent with poorly differentiated, non-small cell
  carcinoma with sarcomatoid features.

  Note: Immunohistochemical studies performed on cytospin
  preparations reveal immunoreactivity for keratin MNF-116.
  No immunoreactivity is seen for S-100 or HMB-45.
.
CXR PA and Lat:
Right lower lobe lung mass status post biopsy. No pneumothorax.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: appears lower and secondary to supratherapeutic INR. Per
family, had colonoscopy in [**2181**]. Given vitamin K and FFP. Plan
for no scope at this time. No further coumadin given difficult
to control INR and GIB. Hct remained stable.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR: likely due to poor po intake in setting
of being on coumadin. No further coumadin.
.
# Lung Mass: Found to have RLL mass on CXR which was confirmed
on CT with malignant appearance. CT guided FNA revealed poorly
diff NSCLC. Oncology was consulted and recommended outpatient
staging PET/CT (which was scheduled on [**2183-2-3**]) and follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the 11th in oncology clinic for possible
palliative chemotherapy if he is interested in this.
.
# Urinary tract infection: Patient with leukocytosis, dirty UA,
hypothermia, hypotension, and lactate of 3.0. finished 7 day
course of zosyn for E. coli UTI [**Last Name (un) 36**] to zosyn. Initially treated
with a few days of vanco when concern for epsis with unclear
source, this was discontinued.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG several years ago and pacer placement in
[**Month (only) **].
TTE showed preserved EF with severe pulm htn. Continued on
ASA/BB/ACEI. Family to review meds with PCP in light of recent
malignancy diagnosis and utility of multiple meds.
.
# ARF: Improved with volume resucitation and treatment of
infection. Restarted ACEI after hydration.
.
# DM: Patient with hyperglycemia. Continued on glargine with
sliding scale insulin.
.
# Depression: Social work consulted, started on mirtazepine.
.
# HTN: Held norvasc given hypotension. Restarted coreg.
.
