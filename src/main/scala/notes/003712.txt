Imaging:
CARDIAC CATH [**2143-3-9**]:
1. Coronary angiography revelaed a right dominant system. The
LMCA
showed no significant stenoses. The LAD showed a smooth 60%
midsegment
stenosis and a smooth 50% distal segment stenosis. The LCX
showed no
significant stenoses with minimal luminal irregularities. The
RCA showed
serial 60% mid and 60% distal stenoses which appeared irregular
and
potentially consistent with resolution of previously ruptured
plaques.
2. Hemodynamic studies demonstrated normal filling pressures
with
severely reduced cardiac index initially measured at 1.6
L/min/m2, which
was likely altered by falsely elevated initial hemoglobin
measurement.
3. Left ventriculography was notable for symmetric
anterolateral,
apical, and inferior wall akinesis suggestive of apical
ballooning
syndrome. The anterobasal and inferobasal regions were
hyperkinetic with
estimated ejection fraction of 40-50%. There was no evidence of
mitral
regurgitation.
4. Successful placement of two overlapping Cypher drug-eluting
stents
(3.5 x 28 mm proximally with 3.5 x 23 mm distally) in the
mid-RCA. Final
angiography demonstrated minimal residual stenosis in the
proximal
stent, moderate disease in the jailed acute marginal, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA
Comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease in setting of possible RCA
plaque
rupture.
2. Normal filling pressures suggestive of normal diastolic
function.
3. Severely abnormal systolic function suggestive of apical
ballooning
syndrome.
4. Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in mid-RCA.
.
ECHO [**2143-3-12**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricle appears
hyperdynamic in all segments except for the apex, which is
hypokinetic (but not akinetic or dyskinetic) relative to the
rest of the left ventricle. The overall left ventricular
ejection fraction is approximately 70 percent. No left
ventricular aneurysm is seen. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Impression: apex is hypokinetic relatiive
to the rest of the left ventricle (hyperdynamic).


Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo F, with no previously known CAD, here for CP, ECG changes,
and troponin leak - ? STEMI vs Takatsubo.
.
# Ischemia - Mrs. [**Known lastname 3068**] was taken straight to the cath lab and
her cath showed RCA & LAD lesions, but nothing that looked
suspicious for the cause of her acute chest pain. A DES was
placed in her RCA, but then hemodynamic measurements were taken
and were significant for a depressed cardiac index. A subsequent
LV-gram showed apical akinesis consistent with Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy. The PA catheter was left in overnight so that
her PA pressures could be monitored. She was continued on
aggrestat until the morning after her catheterization. She did
well overnight, her PA catheter was pulled the next morning, and
she was transferred out to the floor. Daily ECGs were checked
and Mrs. [**Known lastname 3068**] had resolution of inferior ECG changes but
persistent lateral ST elevations and deepening T wave
inversions. She was started on ASA, plavix, bblocker, ACE-i and
a statin. Her lipid panel was checked and was significant for an
LDL of 105 so she was kept on high dose lipitor. Her cardiac
enzymes were cycled x2 after her catheterization and were
trending down. On arrival to the OSH, she already had a troponin
leak so it was unclear if her infarction happened earlier than
the actual onset of her pain. She had no further episodes of
chest pain during her admission, but it was recommended that she
have a stress test as an outpatient to look for other areas of
ischemia.
.
# Pump - Mrs. [**Known lastname 3068**] had a depressed EF and CO by LV-gram, with
apical akinesis being the most prominent finding. This was felt
to be more consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy than MI, but
an exact etiology was not able to be determined. By exam, she
remained euvolemic and her cardiac function improved. Prior to
discharge, an ECHO revealed a restored EF (LV was hyperdynamic
w/ EF of 70% and only hypokinetic apex). She will continue the
bblocker and ACE-i until she follows up with her new outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**], at [**Hospital 5164**] Medical
on [**2143-3-22**].
.
# Rhythm - She was monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospital stay and remained in NSR. Her daily EKGs showed
persistent ST elevations in the lateral leads with deepening T
wave inversions but she remained chest pain free.
.
# Glycemic control - She was started on HISS on admission for
tight glycemic control during her acute coronary syndrome, but
since she has no h/o DM and her cardiac function was improving,
the HISS and fingersticks were discontinued after 48 hours. She
only had one elevated serum glu throughout her stay (glu was 118
on admission).
.
# FEN - She was given a regular, low sodium, cardiac, heart
healthy diet. She received no IVF. Her electrolytes were checked
daily and were repleted prn to keep K >4 and Mg >2.
