Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
diarrhea, weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male with a history of AML, MDS,
and probable invasive aspergillosis of the right lung who is
currently being treated with Azacitidine chemotherapy.  He
presented to the ED with one day of diaphoresis, diarrhea, and
hypotension.  He had been seen in Heme/[**Hospital **] clinic yesterday, at
which time he reported feeling well.  He had a new PICC line
placed and received platelets for a count of 20, increasing to
40 after the transfusion.  He was on C3D5 of his Azacitidine
treatment and received two Azacitidine 75 mg SC injections in
his abdomen.
.
After his clinic visit, he developed diaphoresis, diarrhea, and
hypotension.  He called EMS and was brought to the ED. His
initial vitals were BP 88/50 and HR 90.  He was alert and
oriented, afebrile, and satting well.  On exam, he had slight
oozing at his new PICC site and had guaiac positive stool. A
right IJ line was placed.  He was noted to be neutropenic with
an ANC of 900.  He was given Vancomycin and Zosyn.  His CXR was
unremarkable and CT abdomen did not show any acute
intraabdominal process.  He was given 2 L of fluids and
transfused 2 units PRBCs for a Hct 23.8 down from 30.1 the prior
morning.  His diaphoresis resolved and was no longer having as
much diarrhea.  He was transferred to the ICU for further
management.  Vitals on transfer were T 96.5, HR 87, BP 102/43,
RR 19, and SpO2 100%.
.
On reaching the ICU, the patient reported continued abdominal
discomfort, which he described as a diffuse crampy, bloated
feeling.  He continued to have loose to liquid stool with
visible blood.  He denied any chest pain or pressure.  He
reported SOB, which has improved somewhat since ED arrival back
to his baseline.  He denied any fevers or chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 75 year old male with a history of AML, MDS,
and probable invasive aspergillosis of the right lung who is
currently being treated with Azacitidine chemotherapy.  He
presented to the ED with one day of diaphoresis, diarrhea,
hypotension, and significant Hct drop with guaiac positive stool
felt to be [**12-26**] a rectus sheath hematoma

# Hypotension: Possibly due to hypovolemia or early sepsis
physiology.  Rapid recovery with IVF suggested hypovolemia, but
patient is severely immunocompromised and at risk for infection.
 He had a positive blood culture from [**2137-2-16**] that grew GPCs in
clusters. Possible sources include GI, pulmonary, UTI, and line
infection. His abdomen was significantly tender and copious
loose stools likely secondary to irritation from hemoperitoneum.
He was started empirically on meropnenem, voriconazole,
vancomycin (IV and PO) and flagyl. Flagyl was discontinued on
[**2-17**] w continued po vancomycin. He had a negative C. Diff but
given moderately high suspicion prior to positive blood culture,
a C diff PCR was sent and it was negative.
