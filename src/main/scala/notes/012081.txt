History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 55 y/o male with AML who presented to clinic on [**10-15**] for
a scheduled blood transfusion and was found to be satting 62% on
room air and febrile to 100.6.  He had been more SOB over the
prior few days but denied f/c. A CXR showed LLL colapse with
mediastinal shift to the right and multifocal cavitary lesions.
He got meropenem and hydrocortisone and was admitted.

He has a history of pulmonary aspergillus infection as well as
multiple bacteremic episodes (staph epi, stenotrophomonus, staph
aureus, micrococcus).

Past Medical History:
1. MDS:  Patient's MDS was diagnosed in [**6-/2180**] and initially
treated with danazol and aranesp. In [**6-/2181**] he was hospitalized
for bilateral lung aspergillus infection and enterobacter
bacteremia. A Port-o-cath was placed [**8-/2181**] with three
subsequent hospitalizations for line infection. He was again
admitted from [**Date range (1) 34838**]/05 with pneumonia and bacteremia with
Stenotrophomonus treated with a course of bactrim and
port-o-cath removal. During this course, pulmonary nodules were
visualized and he was treated empirically with voriconazole. He
was again admitted to the hospital on [**2182-4-27**] with febrile
neutropenia and coag(+) staph blood cultures, micrococcus
species, requiring transfer to the ICU for increasing
respiratory distress and multi-focal pneumonia.
2. Hypertension
3. Remote history of kidney stones
4. Hx Sweet's syndrome
5. History of infections with enterobacter, staph epi,
Stenotrophomonus, micrococcus.


Social History:
He lives with his wife at home.  Prior history of smoking 15
years ago - 1 [**12-16**] ppd x 20 years. No EtOH since [**2159**].  No drug
use.

.
Chest CT [**10-15**]: 1. Interval progression of extensive bilateral
pulmonary consolidation, most prominent within the left upper
and left lower lobe but also involving the remaining lobes
centrally, consistent with worsening infectious process. There
are several areas of cavitation in the left upper lobes.
2. Increase in moderate left pleural effusion.
3. Stable appearance of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Additional
numerous nodes within the neck, not meeting criteria for
pathologic enlargement.
.
CXR [**10-18**]: As compared to [**10-16**], there is persistent diffuse
opacification of the left lung, consistent with extensive
consolidation as well as component of pleural fluid. There is no
associated mediastinal shift to indicate volume loss. Stable
moderate pulmonary edema within the right mid lung as well as
improving right basilar subsegmental atelectasis are noted. PICC
catheter remains in stable position.
.
CXR [**10-22**]: Multifocal consolidation remains present bilaterally,
affecting the left upper lobe and lingula to the greatest
degree. There is some associated mild volume loss in the left
upper lobe as well. Additionally, there is vascular engorgement
and perihilar haziness suggesting a component of mild fluid
overload. Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted, left
greater than right.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a 55 y/o male with history of recurrent
pulmonary infections, presenting with LLL collapse and febrile
neutropenia.  Differential Diagnosis included recurrent
pulmonary infection, new pleural effusions, or extrinisic
compression.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with increasing O2
requirement, work of breathing, and tachycardia.  He was treated
empirically with meropenem, vancomycin, acyclovir, bactrim
(stenotrophomonus), and ambisome.  There was significant concern
for fungal infection like mucor.  Due to his and his wife's
wishes, intubation was avoided for as long as possible.  He was
finally intubated and had an increasing oxygen requirement.
Attempts to extubate were unsuccessful.  At the request of Mr.
[**Known lastname 34834**] and his wife, and extensive discussion with his
oncologist, Dr [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1557**], he was switched to comfort measures.
He was extubated and died quietly with his family at the bedside
on [**2182-10-23**].
