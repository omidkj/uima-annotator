Cardiac Catheterization showing lesion in left circumflex artery


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of "benign"
colonic neoplasm, h/o positive PPD, bronchitis, HTN and
hyperlipidemia who was transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] hospital s/p
tamponade with large pericardial effusion s/p pericardial drain.
Prior to admission, the patient had visited the ER with flu-like
symptoms and placed on Zpack and advair. He also initially
reported noticing a swollen right ankle that was later described
by [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] +1 pedal edema. He denies any arthralgias
or rashes. He denies any contact with TB, recent travel or sick

with rusty sputum for the past few weeks with increased
shortness of breath and orthopnea, no chest pain. He denies any
recent weight loss and denies ever having a colonic neoplasm,
benign or malignant, with a recent colonoscopy at [**Hospital 1263**]
hospital 1 month ago. He does admit to having smoked 1 ppd for
5-7 years but quit 20 years ago. He also admits to having been
exposed to asbestos as a former shipyard worker for 10 years 20
years ago.

His first troponin was 0.02 and then 2.8 at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**]. Echo was
positive for tamponade with a negative CT for dissection. On
[**2187-5-9**], underwent pericardiocentesis with 1800 cc fluid
obtained with negative cytology with cell block pending. Opening
wedge was 28 and final wedge 12.

Pericardial fluid:

protein 7.7

WBC 7
Hct 21%
Amylase 63
AFB pending, fungal pending, culture pending, GS pending

EKG [**2188-5-8**]:
Electrical alternans, normal axis. low voltage.

Bronchitis
HTN
s/p MVA
Hyperlipidemia

h/o "benign" colonic neoplasm? -documented by MDs at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**]
where colonoscopy was performed but denied by patient
hemorrhoids
diverticulosis
h/o positive PPD - born in the US, likely exposed as child in
[**State 3908**]

Social History:
The patient works for [**Company 2318**]. He is married. He is a former smoker
having smoked 1 ppd for 5-7 years in the past. He admits to
occasional EtOH. He also admits reluctantly to a history of
cocaine use but will not elaborate. He admits to having tested
for HIV in the past. He was formerly exposed to asbestos as a
former shipyard worker from [**2153**]-[**2163**].

Family History:

Father - Alcoholic, deceased at young age from alcoholism

Physical Exam:
  P=112  BP=130/94  RR=28  95%

Gen- Mildly anxious, appears upset, AOX3
HEENT - PERLA, EOMI, positive nontender submandibular [**Doctor First Name **] with
palpable, nontender thyroid, no supraclavicular,
anterior/posterior cervical [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3495**] - Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs/rubs or gallops
Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Abdomen - Pericardial drain in place with clean, intact site
with no pus, Soft, no hepatosplenomegaly, active bowel sounds,
nontender/nondistended
Ext - No C/C/E


Pertinent Results:
 Echo [**2188-5-11**]:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions:
1. LV function is moderately depressed with an estimated
ejection fraction of
35-40%. There is akinesis of the mid to distal septum. Due to
poor apical
windows, other focal wall motion abnormalities cannot be
excluded.
2. There are no hemodynamically signficant valve abnormalites.
3. There is a small pericardial effusion with some pericardial
thickening.
There is no RV or RA collapse. There is no echo evidence of
cardiac tamponade.
4. The RV appears at least mildly dilated with at least mildly
depressed
systolic function.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2188-5-10**] 7:02 PM
 IMPRESSION: [**Month/Day/Year **] small pleural effusion. Enlarged cardiac
silhouette consistent with the patient's history of pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 58 year old African-American male with a
history of positive PPD, ?colonic neoplasm who presented to
[**Hospital 1263**] hospital with large pericardial effusion s/p
pericardiocentesis on [**2188-5-8**] with pericardial drain transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for medical management.

1. Pericardial effusion: He had a pericardial drain in place on
transfer.  This was pulled out 1 day after admission when output
had decreased to a minimal amount of serosanguinous fluid.  All
cultures of fluid from [**Doctor Last Name **] hospital were negative (AFB,
fungal, aerobic), and cell block/cytology was also negative.  He
had multiple repeat echos while in-house to assess for
reaccumulation or change.  There was no reaccumulation, and
effusion was trivial at time of discharge.  Given that he had a
positive PPD (placed while in-house), sputum was sent x 3 for
AFB smear and was negative.  Although the cause of his effusion
was still unclear at time of discharge, it was likely a viral
myocarditis/pericarditis (given malignancy and TB virtually
excluded).  Given his positive PPD, the decision was made to
treat with Isoniazid (and vitamin B6) prophylactically).  He
will have his LFt's checked monthly through his PCP while on
this therapy.  He was also instructed no to drink alcohol while
on this medication.

2.  CAD: He was noted to have a depressed EF (to 30-35%) on TTE.
 He underwent a ETT-MIBI that showed EF=35% with global HK, no
fixed/reversible defects.  The decision was made to take him for
cardiac catheterization (?3vd or other balanced lesions
contributing to global HK).  Catheterization showed 70% lesion
of left circumflex.  No stent was inserted, for patient had a
?[**Doctor Last Name **] allergy.  He was desensitized for [**Doctor Last Name **] prior to discharge
and will return for stenting of left circumflex.  He was started
on a beta blocker, ACEI, [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lipitor prior to
discharge.  Of note, TTE on the day prior to discharge showed an
improved EF of 40%.  He never had any anginal symptoms while
in-house.

3. Hypertension: He was on HCTZ on admission.  This was stopped,
and he was maintained on ACEI/BB and discharged on these
medications.  His bp remained under good control throughout
hospitalization.

4.  Tachycardic: He was tachycardic to 100-110's.  This
persisted even after removal of the pericardial drain.  He was
started on a beta blocker with some improvement in the
tachycardia

6.  Dispo: He was discharged after [**First Name3 (LF) **] desensitization and will
return for cardiac catheterization 2-3 days after discharge.  He
was instructed about the importance of taking his [**First Name3 (LF) **] and [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**]
daily to avoid in stent thrombosis (and to avoid resensitization
to [**First Name3 (LF) **]).
