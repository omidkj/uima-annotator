Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2144-12-8**]  9:57:04 AM

Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T
wave changes, although ischemia or infarction cannot be
excluded. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2143-4-20**] there is no
significant change.

FINDINGS: A small amount of linear opacification at the left
base likely
reflects atelectasis. No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is
seen. There
may be a trace right pleural effusion or pleural thickening at
the right base. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is seen.
There is tortuosity of the aorta. The heart size is within
normal limits.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.





Brief Hospital Course:
#Advanced dementia - Held multiple discussions about goals of
care and code status. Patient's daughter and healthcare proxy,
[**Name (NI) 71549**], speaking on behalf of her many siblings, decided that the
patient would remain a full code and return home with VNA
services. She declined hospice services but may reconsider in
the future. She prefers to continue giving the patient food and
drink by mouth, despite acknowledging the risks of aspiration,
pneumonia, and even death.
.
#Hypovolemic hypernatremia - Corrected with free water
repletion. Discussed with patient's daughter that it is likely
that this problem will recur given the patient's poor oral
intake.
.
#Acute uncomplicated cystitis - Pan-sensitive E. Coli treated
with ceftriaxone (last day [**12-13**]).
.
#Sacral decubitus ulcer - No evidence of superinfection.
Followed wound care nurse recommendations while in house, then
communicated those recommendations to the patient's VNA.
.
#Hypertension - Well-controlled on clonidine patch and
hydralazine IV prn while in house. Continued preadmission
medication regimen at th
