Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
decompensated heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-5-3**]: Right heart catheterization
[**2146-5-6**]: Left PICC line insertion


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 71180**] is a 68y/o lady with a history of a nonischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 10-15%) originally diagnosed at age 49
(possibly related to a viral cardiomyopathy) s/p BiV ICD
placement, PAF s/p ablation and severe asthma who was admitted
to the Cardiology floor yesterday from Cardiology clinic for
right heart catherization and is transferred to the CCU for
milrinone initiation.

She has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for perhaps 20 years and
during this time her LV contractile function has been
persistently and severely reduced. She received cardiac
resynchronization therapy in [**2141**] which resulted in a transient
marked improvement in her functional status. However, during the
past year or so, there has been a progressive and severe decline
in her functional status, accompanied by the development of
significant mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and
tricuspid regurgitation. She is now at the point where she is
unable to function. She is in [**State 531**] Heart Association class
III (borderline stage IV), with dyspnea during any physical
activity including ordinary activities of daily living. She does
have occasional orthopnea but in general sleeps on two pillows.
She denies chest pains, palpitations, lightheadedness,
dizziness, presyncope, and actual syncope. Yesterday's
echocardiogram shows an even further deterioration of both left
ventricular and right ventricular contractile dysfunction. She
now has a severely dilated and severely hypocontractile right
ventricle.

On right heart cath today, procedure went well per attgs, pt had
excellent response to milrinone. PICC placement failed due to
?sclerosed veins.

Upon arrival to the CCU, Ms. [**Known lastname 71175**] was feeling "OK". She
denies HA, SOB, CP, abdom pain; only feels slightly tired.

[**Name2 (NI) 14595**]-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

IMAGING:
Echocardiogram [**2146-5-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(quantitative biplane LVEF= 20 % ) secondary to severe global
hypokinesis with the basal infero-lateral and antero-lateral
segments contracting best. A left ventricular mass/thrombus
cannot be excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully
coapt. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study dated [**2146-5-2**] (images reviewed),
LVEF has improved slightly, mainly due to more vigorous
contraction of the basal lateral segments. Other findings are
similar.

Bilateral Upper Extemity Ultrasound [**2146-5-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Patent internal jugular, subclavian and axillary
veins
bilaterally. Patent right upper extremity veins. The SVC cannot
be seen with ultrasound. Imaging assessment of the SVC, if
indicated, could be performed with contrast-enhanced CT (it is
reported to us by the clinical team that the patient would
require premedication for such due to contrast allergy).

Procedures:

[**5-3**] Cardiac Catherization:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed modereately elevated
right and
left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 24mmHg and LVEDP
of
29mmHg. There was severely elevated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure
at rest of 78mmHg. At rest there was severely depressed cardiac
index of
1.39L/min/m2. Patient was infused with Milrinone, first bolused
with
50mcg/kg over 3 minutes then 0.375mcg/kg/min over 15 minutes.
With
milrinone infusion there was a significant improvement in
cardiac index
from 1.39 to 2.22L/min/m2. There was a significant reduction in
PASP
from 78 to 58mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe reduction in cardiac index and elevation in PASP at
baseline.
2. Marked hemodynamic response to milrinone therapy.
3. Will admit to CCU for monitoring.
4. Likely left sublclavian vein stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71175**] is a 68y/o lady with nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF 10%), PAF s/p ablation and severe asthma who has had a
marked progressive decline in functional capacity over the past
year with worsened MR/pHTN/TR/RV function, directly admitted
with cardiology clinic for initiation of milrinone infusion.

Active Issues:

# Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Now end-stage CHF, NYHA class
III/IV.  Right heart cath showed excellent response to
milrinone.  Main options for symptomatic improvement include
heart transplant (though she is at the upper limit of age for
this) or PDE inhibitor in order to reduce her pulmonary
hypertension and improve right ventricular function. Patient
admitted to CCU for Milrinone infusion given good CO and PAH
response to Milrinone. She was maintained on Milrinone 0.38
mcg/kg/min which she tolerated well. In terms of rest of her
heart failure
