History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10166**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of SBO and
hyponatremia who presents with LLQ pain, found to have
hyponatremia.
.
Recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 75462**]) with SBO and pulmonary edema and
aspiration. Also noted to have new afib during this admission
with aspirin started. Iron was also started for a diagnosis of
iron deficiency anemia. Both lisinopril and HCTZ were stopped
and her metoprolol dose was increased.
.
Since discharge she has generally been feeling well. Was seen by
her PCP who restarted both lisinopril and HCTZ given LE edema;
metoprolol was also decreased in dose and ASA was stopped. Given
new "severe depression", her outpatient psychiatrist started
sertraline on [**2-12**].
.
On the day of admission she experienced burning in her left
inner thigh; this resolved in 1 hour. Soon thereafter she
experienced LLQ pain not associated with nausea or vomiting.
Given that this did not resolve, she was taken to the ED. By the
time she arrived the pain had resolved (lasted ~1 hour total).
.
In the ED, T 97.8, BP 184/112, HR 92, RR 14, 98% on room air.
She was given metoprolol 25mg, potassium and IVF.

Urine culture
**FINAL REPORT [**2145-2-21**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2145-2-21**]):
      GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha
streptococcus or
         Lactobacillus sp.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with history of SBO and SIADH, presented with abdominal pain
and hyponatremia.
.
1. Hyponatremia. PMH indicates prior history of SIADH with
sodium values as low as 115 in the past. Urine sodiums have been
elevated during some of these episodes which is consistent with
SIADH ([**9-24**]) though it also appears that she has had episodes
which improve with IVF ([**2-27**]). Has history of hypothyroidism
which could also contribute. TSH and T4 are not markedly outside
of normal limits. Also of note, sertraline was started 5 days
prior to admission. HCTZ was also recently restarted. She has an
outbreak of Zoster, and complains of severe pain.  She did
improve slightly with IVF in the ED.  Serum and urine osms
consistent with SIADH. Patient remains asymptomatic without
mental status changes.
Sertraline and HCTZ were discontinued, and patient was kept on a
750cc fluid restriction.  Pain was controlled with standing
tylenol and tramadol. On discharge, sodium was 126. She was
instructed to have this rechecked 2 days after discharge at her
appointment with her PCP.
.

2. Abdominal pain, resolved on arrival to the floor. Patient
with history of SBO, felt to be secondary to radiation therapy.
This episode was short-lived and is now resolved. KUB did not
show obstruction. + BMs.  Pain was mainly LLQ. Of note, Zoster
extends over left lower back and extends into L groin. This may
be the source of her pain.
.
3. Herpes Zoster: Patient has painful zoster over L lower back,
wrapping around into L medial thigh. This could certainly be
contributing to SIADH. Was taking tylenol, tramadol, and
capsaicin cream at home. This regimen was continued in the
hospital

.
4. Urinary tract infection: Urine culture grew >[**Numeric Identifier 4856**] gram
positive bacteria. Patient was asymptomatic, however this may
have contributed to her initial abdominal pain.  She was
discharged with a 7 day course of Bactrim.
.
5. Normocytic anemia. HCT 35, which is about her baseline. Felt
to be iron deficient on last admit though ferritin >200.
Currently above prior value.  No active signs of bleeding.

.
6. Atrial fibrillation. Rate controlled. Not on aspirin as
history of  GI bleed.
