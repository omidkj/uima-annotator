History of Present Illness:
77 yo male with transfusion dependant MDS, moderate AS and dCHF
per echo in [**2145**], CAD s/p 2 stents [**2139**] and HTN who presented to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, as well as
two episodes of chest pain last night.  Pt awoke this morning
was still having lightheadedness, nausea, chest pain and
shortness of breath.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] he was found to
have a SBP 60, WBC 17,500 (normally 1,500), lactate 7.4,
troponin 0.462, BNP 5641 and Cr 3.0 (baseline creatinine 1.0).
CXR: showed signiifcant pulmonary edema, placed on BiPAP for
respiratory status with good relief and increase in saturation
to 100%. Pt was tried on dopamine but developed chest pain and
ishemic EKG changes (ST depressions) so was transitioned to
phenylephrine at [**Location (un) 620**] ED. Got vanco, zosyn, one unit of
PRBC's and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED by [**Location (un) **] ground.
There was discussion of intubation but was not initiated
secondary to concern for further BP drop and improvement with
BiPap.

In the ED labs were notable for a WBC of 25.9 with 41% bands,
BUN/Cr 55/3.0, troponin of 0.83, initial lactate of 2.9.  He was
given cefepime and flagyl in the ED.  A central line was placed
and levophed was continued.  In addition, there was initial
concern for carotid injury, which was subsequently ruled out by
bedside ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo male with transfusion dependant MDS, severe AS and dCHF
per echo in [**2145**], CAD s/p PCA X 2 in [**2139**] who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) **] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, as well as two
episodes of chest pain, found to be in septic shock with MSSA
bacteremia.
.
# Septic Shock: Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with
systolic blood pressure in the 60s.  He was given Vanc, Zosyn,
fluid resuscitated, started on pressors, and medflighted to
[**Hospital1 18**].  He was subsequently transitioned to a levophed gtt and
given Vanc, Cefepime, Levaquin and flagyl given his
immunocompromised state.  His blood cultures from [**Location (un) 620**] and
[**Hospital1 18**] on admission grew out MSSA. Infectious disease service was
consulted. The presumed source was pulmonary as there was
evidence of possible pneumonia on chest CT. The other potential
source considered was skin entering through his port-a-cath. The
port-a-cath was removed by general surgery on hospital day 1.
His antibiotics were narrowed to Nafcillin (initially) and
levaquin (covering for pneumonia). Pt also presented with [**Last Name (un) **],
transaminitis and an NSTEMI, all felt to be secondary to sepsis.
 With agressive care his creatinine returned to baseline and
LFT's and troponins downtrended.  He had a PICC line placed on
[**2-20**] for long term antibiotics. Will need repeat TTE at end of
course of therapy per ID recommendations (to be arranged by ID).
He will also need repeat blood cultures following his antibiotic
course prior to replacing his port ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] RN).
Nafcillin was stopped on [**2-20**] due to concern of
thrombocytopenia, and he was instead discharged on cefazolin 2gm
q8hr to complete a 4 week course.
.
# Afib with RVR:  Pt was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with
rates in the 120's-150's on the first night of the
hospitalization in the setting of sepsis.  He was trialed on
metoprolol and esmolol gtt, but both caused profound hypotension
and bradycardia and were therefore discontinued.  Cardiology was
consulted and recommended not treating his atrial fibrillation
given his hemodynamic stablility and in the setting of acute
illness.  He was not considered to be a candiate for
anticoagulation given his severe MDS.  On the medicine floor he
converted to sinus rhythm, where he remains at discharge.  His
aspirin was continued and a beta blocker was restarted.
.
# dCHF and severe AS:  In the MICU pt had hypoxia with bilateral
crackles with a chest x-ray consistent with pulm edema.  We
restarted lasix 40 mg po on transfer to medical floor and at
times gave him additional PO/IV lasix for goal net negative 1L
per day. His oxygen requirement improved by the day of discharge
and currently is satting 88-92 on room air and 97% on 1L nasal
cannula. The patient takes shallow breaths and O2 sat improves
with deep breaths. We encouraged incentive spirometry. He
continues to have bilateral crackles 1/3 up from bases. Would
recommend daily weights. We have increased his lasix to 40mg
twice daily and would recommend this dose for the next several
days. At that time, please reassess and if appears euvolemic
consider down-titrating dose to 40mg daily (home dose prior to
hospitalization) and may consider uptitrating as well if still
volume overloaded. Creatinine and lytes should be checked
regularly and lasix dose adjusted accordingly.
.
# Chest pain/dyspnea
While on the floor, he had intermittent brief episodes of chest
pain and dyspnea, particularly when receiving anitbiotics. This
was short lived and resolved spontaneously. ECG was checked
during and post chest pain, without any noticeable changes. He
reports that this has been a long-standing issue and takes
nitroglycerin PRN at home. The chest pain is thought to be
stable angina or possibly anxiety. While he was never given SLNG
in the hospita
