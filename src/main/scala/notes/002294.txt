.
P MIBI [**7-/2189**]:  No anginal symptoms or ECG changes
from baseline. Fixed perfusion defects predominantly involving
the inferior and inferolateral walls. No evidence of reversible
perfusion defect. Mild LV hypokinesis, including likely akinesis
of the basal inferior wall, with a moderately depressed EF of
37%.
.
Echo [**7-/2189**]
Prominent symmetric LVH (septum 1.7 cm) with mild global
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process. Moderate MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 16631**]
hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation. No valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] or
resting LVOT gradient is identified.  Findings are suggestive of
a primary cardiomyopathy (HCM) or possibly an infiltrative
process.
.
Bedside echo: no focal wall motion [**Last Name (LF) 16632**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] about 45%.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47 yo F with h/o HTN, schizoaffective disorder,
cardiomyopathy who presented with SOB, diaphoresis, hypotension,
respiratory distress and was subsequently intubated. The
following issues were investigated during this hospitalization:
.
CARDIAC
#Ischemia: Presenting symptoms were not likely due to ischemia
as CKs were flat and the Troponin elevation was minimal.
However, because the patient has CAD risk factors (HTN, DM), she
was maintained on her outpatient cardio-protective meds (ASA,
and Ace inhibitor) and a low dose statin was added.
.
# Pump: Pt. has a history of diastolic heart failure and can
thus benefit from beta blockade with resultant increased filling
time. She was started on Labetalol as an in-patient to control
both her hypertension and her heart rate. However, in an effort
to encourage medication compliance given the patient's history
of non-compliance, Labetalol was switched to QD Atenolol.
.
# Rhythm: Pt had atrial bigeminy on admission, but shortly
thereafter converted to normal sinus rhythm without further
incident.
.
# HTN: Pt. has poorly controlled HTN as an outpatient (200/100
daily, per caseworker) with known medication non-compliance. No
renal artery stenosis by imaging. During this hospitalization,
her goal SBP was 150-160, achieved with Labetalol gtt and
Labetalol PO. She was even found to sustain SBPs in the 130s.
The patient tolerated this lower BP well and was discharged on a
QD regimen of BP meds for better compliance.
.
# SOB: Likely flash pulmonary edema secondary to hypertensive
crisis on admission. Pt was intubated in the ED and extubated
the following day in the CCU without incident and continued to
saturate well on room air.
.
# Psych: Pt. has a history of schizoaffective disorder. She did
not give permission for her psych history to be disclosed so she
was only maintained on her outpatient regimen of Geodon and
Depakote with no other intervention. She also receives 100 mg
IM of Haldol every 3 weeks and received her scheduled injection
on discharge.
.
# Decreased UOP: Patient had a brief period of decreased urinary
output during the hospitalization, approximating 10-15ccs/hr.
Her creatinine also increased. She received a fluid bolus and
her I&Os were monitored with a goal of even fluid status.
Eventually, she began to autodiurese and her creatinine trended
downward. She was discharged on her outpatient dose of Lasix.
.
# DM: Patient was maintained on a RISS.
.
# Anemia: Pt. has a history of iron deficiency anemia and takes
iron as an outpatient. She was found to be guaiac positive on
NGL and rectally. Her Hct was at baseline during the
hospitalization. She was started on Pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] and
continued on iron. Pt. will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
