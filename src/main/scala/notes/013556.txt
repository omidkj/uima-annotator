[**2129-1-21**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Right colectomy and end-to-side ileocolostomy, with free
fluid and
surrounding inflammatory changes, the latter of which may be
post-surgical.  Foci of extraluminal air extending anteriorly
from colonic pouch to fascial flap are noted, and a repeat CT
study with oral gastrografin contrast can be performed to assess
for residual fistula formation or leak.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
atelectasis.
3. Renal atrophy

[**2129-1-22**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. No extraluminal oral contrast identified though majority of
contrast is
still within small bowel and has not passed the anastomosis. If
indicated,
delayed examination may be performed to allow time for contrast
to reach the large bowel. Locules of air in the anterior abdomen
with surrounding
inflammatory stranding and fluid could indicate residual
postoperative changes and inflammation.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis as
previously
seen.

[**2129-1-23**] CXR :
The wire in the left PICC ends in the mid SVC. Moderate
bilateral pleural effusions have increased and there is still
pulmonary edema, difficult to assess given the obscuration by
pleural fluid, but not likely to have improved. Severe
cardiomegaly is chronic. No pneumothorax

[**2129-1-24**] Cardiac echo :
 Rigth ventricular cavity enlargement with preserved free wall
motion. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation. Normal left
ventricular cavtiy size and regional/global systolic function.
Biatrial enlargement.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic.  She
was admitted to the ICU for further management with a working
idagnosis of possible sepsis. Her O2 sats improved with a non
rebreather and her blood pressure responded to volume.  She was
cultured and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics and her
central line was removed as possibly a source of sepsis.

Her oxygenation improved and she was weaned quickly to a nasal
cannula at 2L, although she had bilateral pleural effusions on
her chest xray, right > left. On [**2129-1-25**] she underwent placement
of a pigtail catheter in the right chest which drained one
liter.  Her blood pressure remained stable and her rhythme was
atrial fibrillation rate 70-100.  All cultures were negative
except for yeast in her urine.
Due to problems with access a PICC line was placed in the left
arm on [**2129-1-23**].

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to
improve.  Her tube feedings were resumed and well tolerated and
she underwent a Swallow test and was cleared for ground solids
and thin liquids.  She remained afebrile and her antibiotics
were discontinued.  Her abdominal wound is healing well with the
VAC dressing and it was last changed on [**2129-1-27**]. Her pigtail
catheter was removed on [**2129-1-28**]. She remained hemodynamically
stable. Her follow up chest x ray four hours later did not show
a pneumothorax.

After slow improvement she is being transferred back to rehab
for further Physical Therapy, wound care and nutrition. She had
a picc line for access and a foley in place. The patient was
cared for by the rotating attending services of the Acute Care
Surgical Service.

Discharge Instructions:
* You were admitted to the hospital with an infection possibly
