Pertinent Results:
[**2163-5-16**] DIFFICULT CROSSMATCH AND/OR EVALUATION OF IRREGULAR
ANTIBODIES: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a new diagnosis of an anti-E antibody.
E-antigen is a member of the Rhesus blood group system. Anti-E
antibody is clinically significant and is capable of causing
hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the future Ms. [**Known lastname **] should
receive E-antigen negative blood products for all transfusions.
Approximately 70% of otherwise ABO compatible units will be
E-antigen negative. A wallet card and a letter stating the above

information will be sent to the patient.
.
[**2163-5-17**] CXR: 1. Diffuse interstitial abnormality, whose
chronicity is unclear without comparison to old films.

2. Diffuse bony demineralization with possible compression
deformities of several thoracic vertebral bodies, chronicity
indeterminate.

3. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
.
[**2163-5-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm @ 81
Nonspecific precorial/anterior T wave abnormalities - cannot
exclude in part ischemia - clinical correlation is suggested
No previous tracing available for comparison
.
[**2163-5-17**] ERCP: Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus
was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla
Cannulation: Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was successful
and superficial with a sphincterotome. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in partial opacification. The partial
pancreatogram was normal in appearance. Cannulation of the
biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
Biliary Tree: Many irregular stones ranging in size from 2mm to
6mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the
common bile duct.
Procedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Many, many pigmented gallstones were extracted successfully from
the CBD using a balloon catheter. The duct was clear at the end
of the procedure on occlusion cholangiogram.
Radiologic interpretation:  Fluoro time: 8.1 min. The CBD
measured approx. 8 - 16mm. Filling defects in CBD were noted.
The intrahepatic ducts were normal.
Impression: Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was successful
and superficial with a sphincterotome. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in partial opacification. The partial
pancreatogram was normal in appearance. Cannulation of the
biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
The CBD measured approx. 8 - 16mm. Filling defects in CBD were
noted. The intrahepatic ducts were normal.
Many irregular stones ranging in size from 2mm to 6mm that were
causing partial obstruction were seen at the common bile duct.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o CAD, HTN, CHF, hypercholesterolemia,
pernicious anemia, depression/anxiety, and dysphagia.  She
initially presented with r-sided abd pain and diarrhea, and
underwent ERCP/sphincterotomy on [**5-17**] for CBD stone.  She was
then transferred to the MICU for chest pain and afib with RVR.
Pt noted to be in clinical heart failure with BNP noted >70,000.
 Seen by cardiology who recomended med mgt.  Diuresed and
converted to NSR with dilt, beta blocker.  She was transferred
back to the floor for further diuresis on [**2163-5-20**], and completed
a 7-day course of levo/flagyl post-ERCP. She remained stable in
NSR until [**5-24**], when she again went into Afib with RVR with
hypotension to the 80s, and was transferred back to the ICU.
She spontaneously converted into Sinus w/i 8 hours and BP
stabilized.
.
Problem list:
.
# Afib: Recurrent episodes, s/p two ICU admissions.  Pt need
atrial kick to maintain BP.  She was started on digoxin 0.125
every other day, as well Metoprolol for rate control. Metoprolol
was titrated up to 25mg TID.  Of note, she was on Correg as an
outpatient (3.125 [**Hospital1 **]), and can discuss changes in her b-blocker
with her outpatient physicians.  She should discuss long-term
anti-coaggulation with her physician.
.
# CHF - EF 35% and Echo was suggestive of diastolic dysfunction
as well. BNP was >70,000 and exam revealed volume overload.  She
was diuresed with IV lasix.  Her final lasix dose is 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was placed on metoprolol as above.  ACE-I causes fatigue per
family report, but she should discuss starting an angiotensive
receptor blocker with her outpatient physician.
.
# Ischemia/Chest Pain - Medical management recommended by
Cardiology.  She was continued on aspirin, b-blocker, and
statin.  She should consider [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.
.
# Biliary obstruction/CBD stones: ERCP performed on [**2163-5-17**] (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] w/ sphincterotomy and removal of multiple pigmented
stones.  Completed 7 days of levo/flagyl.
.
# Chronic lung disease: nature unclear, but on 2L O2 at baseline
at home. CXR here with diffuse interstitial process.  After
diuresis, she was satting well (>98%) on rooom air.  She may
require home O2 in the future.
.
# Post-herpetic neuralgia (chronic right arm pain): On fentanyl
TP (changed every FIVE days), dilaudid prn, and  Cymbalta.
.
# PPx: hep sq
.
# Code: DNR/DNI

Medications on Admission:
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Fentanyl patch 25 mcg changed subcutaneously q 72 hr.
According to the dtr, she has been changing it q 5 days because
it was making her sedated and confused.
2. Cymbalta 3
