Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, bradycardia, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89M w/ COPD, Afib on coumadin, moderate dementia and urinary
retention with an indwelling foley, admitted with altered mental
status, admitted to MICU for fever, new complete heart block and
question of sepsis. The morning of admission, patient noted to
be fatigued and unable to walk. At baseline, he lives at [**Hospital1 100**]
and generally is oriented to self and can answer basic
questions, and walk with a walker. On exam at rehab, he had
bradycardia to 40s, BP 154/64, O2 sat 94% RA, temp 99.3. EKG
showed complete heart block. He was transferred to the ED for
further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were: 101.3 44 155/37 32 87% RA. Hypoxia
improved with 2L nasal cannula. UA sig for UTI (>182 WBC, lrg
leuks, pos nitrates, many bacteria). CXR concerning for ?
infiltrate. Pressures stable with SBPs 120s-130s. Got 2L IVF,
ceftriaxone and azithro. Confirmed 3rd degree heartblock on EKG.
Labs showed acute renal failure (Cr 1.6, baseline 1.0), lactate
2.7, and there was concern for mild sepsis. An 18G and 20G
placed. A&O&1. Patient confirmed DNR, but would consider a PPM.
His foley catheter was replaced.

On arrival to the MICU, patient resting comfortably. On
questioning by his daughter he denies pain. She felt that he
appeared better than this morning. On further discussion, they
would like temporary pacing if necessary. They would like their
father to be DNR/DNI, but would be okay with reversing that
status during a pacemaker placement.

IMAGING:
[**2162-6-3**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with high grade A-V block. Baseline
artifact obscures interpretation but it appears that complete
heart block is present with a junctional escape of approximately
40 beats per minute. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-5-29**]
heart block is now new. High grade A-V block is new. TRACING #1


[**2162-6-4**] EKG: High grade A-V dissociation with junctional escape
at approximately 34 beats per minute. What appear to be
conducted P waves are likely isorhythmic dissociation. There is
variation in P-P interval which may be due to ventriculophasic
affect. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-5-29**] heart block
persists. TRACING #2

[**2162-6-3**] CXR: Low lung volumes.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis
but aspiration is difficult to exclude.  Possible trace
bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2162-6-4**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspi
