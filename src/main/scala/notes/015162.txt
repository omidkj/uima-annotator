Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72 yo man with h/o esophageal CA, COPD,
multiple aspiration PNA in the past, currently NPO with g-tube
who lives with family and presents with cough and difficulty
breathing since this morning, associated with sore throat, nasal
congestion.  Per his family, he was also noted to be somnolent
this morning and not at his mental baseline.  They feel that he
has been weaker than usual over the last 2-3 days.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 101.6, P 128, BP 90/63, R 30, O2
93% on RA.  He initially triggered for tachycardia, fever, and
hypotension, and he was given 1L of NS.  He had a CXR, which
showed likely PNA in the left lung base, as well as abnormal
densities in the right apex concerning for mass lesion. He was
given Levoquin and Ceftriaxone for PNA.  His EKG showed sinus
tachycardia.  His VS at the time of admission were P 120, SBP
110, R 30, O2 96% on 2L.

On the floor, he notes continued difficulty breathing, although
he is on his home oxygen regimen. Per his daughters, he is more
alert than earlier today, but is still "slower" than his mental
baseline.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI; family notes bilateral foot swelling/pain x 5 days,
now resolved
(-) Denies fever, chills (although he has been taking tylenol
for bilateral foot pain). Denies headache, visual changes.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations. Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in
bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

[**2136-2-21**] CXR - Limited study due to low lung volumes. Relative
increased ill-defined density at the left lung base which may
represent early developing pneumonia or possibly aspiration,
although atelectasis remains a consideration. The abnormal
densities in the right apex are atypical for infectious foci.
Further evaluation with chest CT after acute presentation
subsides is advised due to the possibility of underlying mass
lesion in patient with history of prior malignancy and risk
factors for primary lung cancer (emphysema)

[**2136-2-22**] RUQ US: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound with no
etiology for fever of unknown origin identified. Prior
cholecystectomy with unchanged mild extrahepatic biliary
dilation likely related to postcholecystectomy state.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with esophageal cancer, COPD, multiple
aspiration pneumonia who presented on [**2136-2-21**] with productive
cough, tachycardia, relative hypotension and altered mental
status.

1. Pneumonia: Presented with fever, tachcardia, productive cough
and LLL infiltrate on CXR concerning for pneumonia.  Empirically
started on Vancomycin/meropenem due to history of ESBL and MRSA
in the cough in the past.  He was also started on prednisone 60
mg daily steroid burst for presumed COPD exacerbation.  He had
systolic blood pressure in 90s on admission which responded to
three liters of normal saline bolus. On the floor, his
antibiotic regimen was narrowed to levaquin. He went discharged
with instructions to complete a 7 day course of levaquin.

2. Altered mental status: Likely in the setting of infection.
No report of fall or other reason to suspect intracranial
pathology.  Mental status improved with fluid resuscitation and
antibiotic treatment.

3. RUQ tenderness: Patient did not complain of abdominal pain
but did have tenderness on initial exam without rebound or
guarding.  Liver enzymes were normal normal except for minimally
elevated AST @ 55.  Has history of gallstone pancreatitis s/p
cholecystectomy.  RUQ US showed normal pathology.

4. Diastolic heart failure: Was noted to have significant
crackles on exam on day 2 likely from fluid resuscitation.
Restarted on home lasix 60 mg po qam and 30 mg po qpm with good
response in urine output and improvement in exam.

5. R apex lung lesion: Concerning for malignancy in the setting
of cancer history and risk factors for primary lung CA
(significant smoking history).  Per heme-onc note in [**Name (NI) 205**], pt
has many waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] lesions in his lungs (c/w
aspiration). They have discussed with the family that even if
this were recurrent cancer, there is no treatment that would be
reasonable to pursue, given that he would be unlikely to
tolerate chemo, radiation, or even biopsy (risk of PTX).
