Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75yoF with h/o RA, Zenker's diverticulum, diverticulitis s/p
colostomy, breast ca s/p mastectomy presents with 6-day history
of cough, pleuritic CP, chills, SOB, and low-grade fever. She
was seen by her PCP 2 days prior to admission who prescribed
Azithromycin after CXR showed pneumonia. She did not improve
with this and continued to have cough productive of clear sputum
and low-grade fevers - highest temp at home was 99.5. She also
reports increased stoma output and abdominal pain after starting
the Zpak as well as one episode of urinary incontinence this
morning.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.0 P 103 BP 115/61 RR 24 O2 sat
95-97% on RA. CXR showed bibasilar opacities and pleural
effusions suspicious for pneumonia as well as diffuse
hyperinflation and subcutaneous air along the R chest wall vs.
overlapping fat. She was given 1L NS as well as IV levofloxacin
750 mg. Labs revealed Na 127, Cr 0.4, WBC 13.6, Hct 34.8, and
mildly elevated AlkP at 208. Blood cultures were sent. The
patient was initially called out to the floor but had an episode
of hypotension to the 80s systolic. One liter NS was given with
improvement of SBP to the 90s. She reportedly has difficult
access and fluid was administered through 1 PIV. She was then
admitted to the ICU.
.
Of note, the patient has had a recent liver ultrasound as
outpatient to evaluated elevated alkaline phosphatase and CEA of
9, but no abnormalities were noted on ultrasound aside from
liver hemangiomas.
.
On the floor, VS are 97.8  90  104/64  25  92% on RA. She
appears anxious but is breathing comfortably. She coughs
frequently during the interview. On lung exam, transmitted upper
airway wheezing and diminished breath sounds at the bases. She
reports that at baseline she is able to walk gingerly without
assitance. She has been having slightly decreased PO recently
since starting the antibiotics.

blood cultures: No growth to date at time of discharge.
Urinary legionella negative

EKG: NSR, Nl axis and intervals; RBBB, TWI in V2
CXR [**2186-1-12**]
FINDINGS: There are bibasilar opacities and pleural effusions,
right greater than left. Fluid is seen in the right major and
minor fissures. Although these opacities appear to include
atelectatic changes, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
The mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is diffuse
hyperinflation suggestive of emphysema.
.
Note is made of diffuse osteopenia. The cortical contour of the
left proximal humerus is irregular but incompletely visualized
due to overlying external hardware.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar opacities and pleural effusions; pneumonia cannot
be excluded.
2. Hyperinflation, likely secondary to COPD.


Brief Hospital Course:
75yoF with h/o RA, Zenker's diverticulum, diverticulitis s/p
colostomy, breast ca s/p mastectomy presents with 6-day history
of cough, pleuritic CP, chills, SOB, and low-grade fever
.
# Bronchitis: On presentation was 95-97% on RA. CXR showed
questionable bibasilar infiltrate with R > L pleural effusions.
She was started on levofloxacin 750 mg IV for presumed community
acquired pneumonia. Urinary legionella was negative, sputum
culture grew yeast which is a contaminant. On reconsideration,
cough and dyspnea are better explained by bronchitis than
pneumonia given absence of radiographic or physical examination
findings consistent with pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension: Blood pressure was 100s/60s on initial
presentation to the ED but dropped to the 80s/50s. Blood
pressure  was fluid responsive and remained in the 100s/60s in
the ICU for one night. Hypotension is related to reduced PO
intake and loose stools and transient sepsis related to urinary
tract infection. PO intake was encouraged she remained
normotensive in the 100/50's throughout the remainder of her
hospital stay. Amoldipine was held on admission and was not
resumed on discharge as patient remained normotensive.
.
# Urinary tract infection: UA performed after admission was
leukocyte esterase positive with many white blood cells and
bacteria. Though epithelial cells were isolated in the UA
suggesting that the speimenm was not a clean catch, the high
number of whites and bacteria suggested that there may have been
a true urinary tract infection. She denied dysuria however she
is not a reliable historian. She had been started on
levofloxacin as above and this was continued for a total of 5
days of treatment for urinary tract infection.
.
# Hyponatremia: Na 127 on admission. Thought to be [**2-15**] poor PO
intake. Corrected to 133 on morning following admission.
.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: Patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis
with significant deformities of her phalanges bilaterally. She
had decided against DMARD therapy in the past and her disease
has been managed symptomatically with tylenol and ibuprofen
which was continued while in the
