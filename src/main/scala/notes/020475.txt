History of Present Illness:
    55 yo female w/ hx of asthma, COPD, restrictive lung dz,
demyelinating syndrome and adrenal insufficiency p/w SOB,
increase wheezing, and cough.  She initially had noted blood on
the toilet paper and undewear for a few days.  Started with
spotting, but they next day she reported increased bleeding (but
not enough to fill a pad).  Did not notice blood while she
straigh cathed herself but not in the tube.  Reported discomfort
with urination.  Talked to her PCP who recommended she follow-up
with gynecology for evalaution of post-menopausal beelding.
     However, during conversation with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2125-1-23**], she was
noted to be short of breath and audibly wheezing.  Asked to come
to emergency room for evaluation.
     Upone presentation to emergency room, she had reported a
four-day history of SOB.  Also with two episodes of severe
substernal chest pain. She also had epigatric discomfort. Each
episode lasted for about 5 minutes.  No radiation to arm, neck,
or jaw.  Had audible wheezing.  Reported using albuterol
nebulizers on the morning of admission with moderate relief.  In
addition, she has reported rhinorrhea, feeling achey.  Cough
with yellow sputum for three days.  She has been taking
increased amounts of percocet because of a fall she sustained
weeks ago.  She also has risk factors for infection: age, IgG
deficiency, restrictive lung dz, asthma, chronic demyelinating
dz promoting weakness.
     In the ED, initial vital signs were Temp=98.2, HR=102,
BP=156/106, RR=36, 02 sat=89% RA.  Found to have ABG of
7.27/58/180 on 50% FM. CTA was negative for PE but showed [**Date Range 25730**]
PNA. CT head negative for bleed. Pt was given continuous alb
nebs, methylprednisolone 125mg IV, levofloxacin 500mg IV and
transferred to the MICU overnight.
     In addition, patient reported right thigh pain.  Described
as [**2130-5-22**] pain.  Sleeps with her leg on a pillow.  In the ED,
she was ruled out for MI and placed on telemetry until the
second set returned.  Also described low back pain.  Denies
currently any diarrhea, constipation or changes in bowel
pattern.  Has been slightly improved since a recent fall at the
end of [**Month (only) 404**] where she had slipped on some ice but refused
admission or evaluation.  Of note, she also had a fall in [**9-18**]
and had been noted to have a right hip hematoma.

CT head W/O CONTRAST  [**2125-1-23**] 7:07 PM
56 year old woman with possible PE, also recent fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ICH in case of anticoagulation
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Possible PE, recent fall. Evaluate for intracranial
hemorrhage prior to anticoagulation.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head was obtained, compared
with examination dated [**2124-10-21**].
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally mid-line structures. There are foci of
hypodensity in the left parietal lobe, as well as in both
frontal regions, which have an unchanged appearance since the
prior examination. There is also diffuse mild periventricular
white matter hypodensity, associated with chronic microvascular
angiopathy. Osseous and soft tissue structures remain
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Stable
appearance since [**2124-10-21**].

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2125-1-23**] 5:21 PM
INDICATION: Shortness of breath and chest pain. Evaluate for
pulmonary embolism.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was performed before and after the
administration of IV contrast using the CT pulmonary angiography
protocol. 100 cc of Optiray non-ionic contrast was administered
for this examination. Non-ionic contrast was used given the
rapid bolus required for CT angiography.
CTA: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The aorta and
great vessels appear within normal limits.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. Examination of lung
windows demonstrates non- dependent consolidation of the left
lower lobe, with slightly bulging fissure, consistent with left
lower lobe pneumonia. There are no pleural effusions or evidence
of pneumothorax. The central airways appear patent to the
segmental bronchi bilaterally. Coronally and sagittally
reformatted images were also reviewed, which do not show
significant abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Left lower lobe pneumonia.

CT ABDOMENT WITH IV CONTRAST
CONTRAST: Oral and intravenous nonionic contrast were
administered due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required
for this examination. Of note, the patient developed hand and
foot itching shortly after contrast administration, without
respiratory difficulty. The patient's vital signs remained
stable. She was given Benadryl following the acute incident.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are atelectasis
changes at the
left lung base. Minimal atelectasis within the right middle lobe
medially.
The visualized portions of the heart and pericardium appear
unremarkable.
Multiple small, hypodense liver lesions are seen, unchanged from
the previous examination, and too small to accurately
characterize. There is stable appearance of mild intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. The common bile duct is decreased in size from
the previous examination. The pancreas, spleen, and ad
