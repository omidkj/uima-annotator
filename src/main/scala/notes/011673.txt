Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21571**]
Chief Complaint:
Pain, poor PO.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a a 76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed
metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents with failure to
thrive.
.
Recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2191-3-25**] - [**2191-4-3**]) with abdominal
pain and constipation. An abdominal CT showed a 28 x 53 mm mass
in the body and tail of the pancreatic as well as multiple
hepatic lesions, the largest measuring 19 x 21 mm, peritoneal
implants, and omental caking. She underwent diagnostic
paracentesis on [**2191-3-28**] with left groin lymph node biopsy.
Cytology of the peritoneal fluid was positive for
adenocarcinoma, and the left groin biopsy showed metastatic
adenocarcinoma staining positive for CK7, CK20, and CEA,
negative for mammoglobin and GCDFP. She also underwent bone
scan, which showed likely metastases in T6-T7 vertebral bodies.
CA [**02**]-9 on [**2191-3-27**] was 2483. She then underwent therapeutic
paracentesis with a total of 5 liters ascitic fluid removed.
.
She was then seen in oncology clinic on [**4-6**] at which time she
reported having a low appetite, taking three small meals per
day.
.
Since that visit, she has been "dramatically worse" with little
to no PO intake. This is partly due to poor appetite and partly
due to inability to keep down significant PO. She has also been
delerious, "talking to people not there" and quite disoriented.
The family reports very poor urine output and no bowel movements
since Sunday. Her pain has been minimally controlled and is
focussed in the back and right chest area. Given these
constilation of symptoms, the patient presented to the ED for
further care.
.
In the ED, initial T 97.3, HR 102, BP 115/56, RR 24, 92% on NRB.
She was given IV morphine for pain control and Levofloxacin,
Flagyl and CTX.

Blood Cx NGTD
.
ECG #1 ([**2191-4-8**]) - Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2191-3-25**] the rate has increased.
.
ECG #2 ([**2191-4-8**]) - Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous
tracing no change.
.
V/Q Scan ([**2191-4-8**]) -
INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images of the lungs were obtained in
8 views following the administration of 43.5mCi of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m DTPA
aerosol. Perfusion images in the same 8 views were obtained
following the intravenous administration of 5.8mCi of Tc-99m
MAA. The results were compared with the chest x-ray done
[**2191-4-8**].
There is mild decreased activity in the posterior perfusion and
ventilation images of the right lung that likely corresponds to
atelectasis/ effusion on the chest x-ray. There are small
matched perfusion and ventilation defects in the lung periphery.
Overall, findings are consistent with a low likelihood ratio for
recent pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION: Mild decreased activity in the right lung on
posterior views likely corresponds to the effusion on the chest
x-ray. Findings are consistent with a low likelihood ratio for
recent pulmonary embolism.
.
Abdomen X-ray ([**2191-4-8**]) -
FINDINGS: There are some gas filled loops of centrally
positioned large bowel. Stool seen in the ascending colon and
air seen in the rectum. Bowel gas pattern is nonspecific and
does not suggest ileus or obstruction. There is evidence of a
spinal fusion likely at L4 and L5. There is degenerative disease
in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
.
CXR ([**2191-4-8**]) -
FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis. There is no definite evidence of pneumonia. The
aorta is somewhat tortuous and calcified. There is no overt
congestion. The heart is again at the upper limits of normal
size.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral atelectasis and pleural effusions which
are not appreciably changed from prior study.
.
CT Head ([**2191-4-8**]) -
FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally
midline structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major
territorial infarct is apparent. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The major intracranial cisterns
are preserved. There is a linear region of hypoattenuation
within the anterior limb of the internal capsule on the left and
in the periventricular deep white matter adjacent to the
anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle on the right consistent
with old lacunar infarctions. There is mild periventricular
hypoattenuation consistent with chronic microvascular
infarction. There is mild prominence to the bifrontal extra-
axial spaces bilaterally most consistent with atrophy. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Old lacunar infarcts and mild bilateral frontal lobe atrophy.

.
CT Abdomen / Pelvis ([**2191-4-8**]) -
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate pleural
effusions bilaterally with associated relaxation atelectasis,
increased from previous. Evaluation of intra-abdominal and
intrapelvic organs is quite limited given lack of intravenous
contrast administration and moderate-to-large amount of ascites
within the abdomen. However, numerous metastatic lesions within
the liver are again noted, many of which have increased in size
over the short interval of time. The gallbladder, spleen, and
visualized large and small bowel appear within normal limits. A
gastric hiatal hernia is again noted. The kidneys again
demonstrate numerous cystic lesions and other lesions not well
characterized on this non-contrast study. There is dense
calcified atherosclerotic plaque throughout the abdominal aorta.
There is no hydronephrosis. The adrenal glands appear within
normal limits. Given lack of IV contrast administration, the
exact boundaries of the pancreatic mass within the body and tail
is difficult to adequately measure; however, it appears grossly
unchanged. No free air is identified within the abdomen.
CT PELVIS: A large amount of ascites is present within the
pelvis, limiting evaluation. Several soft tissue nodules are
again identified to the right of the bladd
