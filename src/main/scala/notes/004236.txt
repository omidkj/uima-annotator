Service:  CCU SERVICE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old female
with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, status post prior
ablation and cardioversion with a recent recurrence of her A
fib who is admitted for a reablation procedure.  She had
hypotension during the procedure to the 60s systolic.  She
was found to have a hematocrit drop from 41 to 29 at this
time and was found to have a retroperitoneal bleed and a
rectus sheath bleed on CT scan done emergently.

The patient was transfused two units of blood and placed on a
Dopamine drip with good blood pressure response to the 120s
to 150s and was transferred to the CCU for her critical care
intubated.  The patient had been intubated electively prior
to the procedure.  Her Heparin was reversed with Protamine
after her drop in hematocrit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
starting in [**2133**], status post ablation in [**9-/2152**],
cardioversion in 12/[**2151**].  She has been treated in the past
with Sotalol and Cardizem.

Echocardiogram on [**2152-11-28**] showing an ejection fraction of
greater than 55%, mildly dilated left atrium and a small
secundum atrial septal defect.  Also a history of
hypertension, dyslipidemia, mitral valve prolapse, status
post hysterectomy, appendectomy, right leg vein ligation.
Also status post a recent left eye hemorrhage and a right
ankle fracture.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Accupril 10 p.o. q d.
2.  Propafenone 300 mg q a.m., 225 mg q noon time and q p.m.
3.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q hs which was stopped two days
prior to admission.
4.  Multivitamin.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a part time teacher.  No
tobacco, no alcohol.  No drug use.  She is divorced.  She has
four grown children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CCU:  Temperature,
94.8; pulse, 87; blood pressure, 130/76; saturation, 100% on
ventilator of AC, 614; PEEP, 5; FIO2, 0.4.  General, she is
intubated and sedated on Propofol.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat, pupils were mid size and sluggish.  Anicteric
sclera.  Mucous membranes, dry.  Left subconjunctival
hemorrhage.  Neck, without jugular venous distention.  Chest,
clear to auscultation.  Vented breath sounds anterolaterally.

or murmurs.  Abdomen, soft, hypoactive but present bowel
sounds.  Left rectus abdominal mass.  No ecchymoses.
Extremities, there is a cast on her right lower extremity.
Pulses are 1+ in the left dorsalis pedis with good capillary
refill.  Extremities are cool.  No edema.   Mild cyanosis of
her nail beds.  The patient had a left femoral A line and two
right groin venous lines and one femoral venous line.  Her
popliteal pulse on the right leg was intact.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO THE CCU:  Show a white blood count
of 12; hematocrit, 32; platelets, 173.  INR, 1.3; PTT, 30.
Sodium, 143; potassium, 3.7; chloride, 112; bicarbonate, 20;
BUN, 17; creatinine, 0.7.  Glucose, 219.  Calcium, 6.8.
Magnesium, 1.3.  Free calcium, 0.98.  Initial blood gas,
7.28/41/473.  Lactate, 3.0.  Subsequent blood gas of
7.48/26/200 on FIO2 of 40%.

CT of abdomen shows left rectus sheath hematoma 4.9 x 7 cm.
Pelvic CT shows 5.5 x 4.7 right pelvic and 7.8 x 6 cm
hematoma which is likely bleeding from the left common
femoral vein.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 66 year old female with
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which is recurrent, status
post past ablation procedures in cardioversion and trials of
antiarrhythmics, now with large retroperitoneal bleed status
post atrial fibrillation ablation with hypotension.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a demand
ischemic event to her myocardium with elevation in her CK and
troponin, a right common and superficial femoral deep venous
thrombosis with subsequent multiple small pulmonary emboli
and urinary tract infection.

1.  Hypotension - The patient was hypovolemic status post
large bleed with good response to Dopamine and blood, status
post a bleed.  Her blood pressure normalized after this
volume repletion and the patient actually became hypertensive
later in her hospital course.

2.  Atrial fibrillation - The patient had a history of
recurrent atrial fibrillation with completed ablation this
admission.  She did have brief episodes of atrial
fibrillation and atrial tachycardia on one to two occasions
during this hospital admission.  She was started on
Flecainide which was discontinued status post her myocardial
infarction and started on Sotalol which was also
discontinued.  She will just be continued for now on
Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. for rate control.  She will
follow up with the EP Service with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further
management of her atrial fibrillation.

3.  Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary
embolus - The patient began having increased right lower
extremity edema after being transferred to the Floor from the
Unit.  This is the leg in which she has a cast for her right
ankle fracture.  Lower extremity ultrasound showed a common
femoral and superficial femoral deep vein thrombosis in her
right leg.  Because the patient was still showing evidence of
decreasing hematocrit at this time and had a contraindication
to anticoagulation initially with this decreasing hematocrit,
an IVC filter was placed.  This was placed through the left
femoral vein without rebleed.  The patient tolerated this
procedure well.

One day after placement of the IVC filter, the patient
started to complain of feeling short of breath and began to
require O2 via nasal cannula to keep her sats in the 90%,
with her room sat being in the high 80 percents.  A trial CT
scan done at that time showed multiple small pulmonary emboli
in the second and third order pulmonary arteries.  At this
time her hematocrit had been stable and she was started on
Heparin with a goal PTT of 50 to 60.

After 72 hours of a stable hematocrit on the Heparin GTT, she
was started on Coumadin for her deep vein thrombosis,
pulmonary emboli and atrial fibrillation.  She was given 5 mg
q d and finally reached therapeutic Coumadin level on the
26th.  She will be discharged on her former Coumadin dose of
2.5 mg p.o. q hs with follow up of her INRs with her Primary
Care Physician in [**Location (un) 3844**].

4.  Myocardial ischemia - The patient did show evidence of
myocardial infarction in the setting of her bleed.  This was
most likely a low flow demand infarct rather than an acute
coronary syndrome.  Her peak CK was 300 and she did rule in
by index.

5.  Pump function - An echocardiogram done after her rule in
showed a decrease in her ejection fraction from 55% to 50%.
She had normal PA pressures of 18 mm of Mercury.  She did
have evidence of global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis which was most likely secondary to her multiple
small pulmonary emboli.

6.  Urinary tract infection - The patient was found to have a
urinary tract infection after complaining of abdominal pain.
She was started on a three day course of Ciprofloxacin and
tolerated this well.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient was discharged after
demonstrating a stable hematocrit while being therapeutic on
her Coumadin for 24 hours.  She will follow up with her
Primary Care Doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 766**], which is in 24 hours after
discharge, for checking of her INR.  She will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to follow up on her atrial fibrillation and
ablation this week.

She has decided to keep her IVC filter in place.  It had the
option of being a removable IVC filter, however, she felt
that she would feel more comfortable leaving the IVC filter
in place and remaining on her anticoagulation as she would
need to anyway.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism.
3.  Urinary tract infection.
4.  Hypertension.
