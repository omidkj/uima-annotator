Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary artery bypass grafting times four with left internal
mammary to left anterior descending, right saphenous vein
grafting to diagonal, obtuse marginal, posterior left
ventricular [**10-28**]


History of Present Illness:
54 yo M w/ h/o CAD s/p PCI (DES to ostial Cx and DES to OM1 in
[**2192**]), DM type 2, HTN, and HLD presenting with intermittent DOE
and chest pressure over the past month. Per patient report, had
negative stress test at [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]two
weeks ago, which showed fixed lesion. Returned home and symptoms
persisted so went to [**Hospital6 3105**] for evaluation on
[**10-16**]. Per report, EKG there was at baseline and enzymes
negative, BNP not elevated, Ddimer negative. They gave him 150mg
of Plavix and nitropaste. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work
up as patient's prior stenting was done here.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 96 60 159/76 16 100% 2L. Patient
described continued low level chest pressure in the center of
his chest w/ leftward radiation. Described SOB, worse w/
exertion; unable to walk a block because of SOB. Also notes h/o
diaphoresis with pain and SOB. No recent fevers or chills.
Endorsed swelling in legs. No N/V/Abd pain. No changes in bowel
or bladder habits. Reports took aspirin today, but has not been
taking plavix for the past 7 days, and he does relate the
increasing chest pain and DOE with this noncompliance with
Plavix. Labs in ED were notable for negative troponin x1. EKG
was at baseline- sinus in 60s w/ RBBB. Patient was admitted to
[**Hospital1 1516**] for further work up. VS on transfer: HR 65 BP 120/67 RR 13
O2 sat 100% on 2L.

Pertinent Results:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45% to 50%  >= 55%
Findings

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 - 50 %). Inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn. Inferior wall remains
hypokinetic.
Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. 1+ TR. Aorta intact.

CXR: [**2193-11-1**]: Top normal heart size is unchanged since
preoperative study. The mediastinum is no longer widened. Aside
from minimal left basal atelectasis, the lungs are clear and
very small pleural effusions are probably decreasing
postoperatively. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the
mid SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1071**] was admitted with 1 month of worsening chest pain.  He
underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**10-21**] which revealed
severe three vessel disease.  He was referred for coronary
artery bypass grafting, but as he was given Plavix at the time
of the catheterization he underwent a Plavix washout.  He was
seen by a dentist for tooth pain and a Panorex and exam revealed
the need for full mouth tooth extraction, which was deferred
until cardiac surgery was complete. Blood sugar was not
well-controlled at home with HgbA1c of 8.4%. [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted to help in the management of diabetes and the patient
was placed on an aggressive sliding scale with glargine as well.
He also underwent teaching for improved dietary control of his
diabetes.

On [**10-28**] he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting times
four with left internal mammary to left anterior descending,
right saphenous vein grafting to diagonal, obtuse marginal,
posterior left ventricular.  Please see the operative note for
details. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in
critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care
unit.  On post-operative day one he was extubated and weaned
from pressors.  By the post-operative day two he was ready for
transfer to the floor.  His chest tubes and wires were removed
per protocol.  The sleep service was consulted for sleep apnea
they felt he should be seen in their clinic as an out patient in
[**3-7**] weeks. Beta-blockers were titrated.  Plavix was restarted.
He was diuresed toward his preop weight. He followed by [**Hospital **]
Clinic. He transitioned to his home PO diabetic medications. He
was followed by physical therapy. His pain was well controlled
with PO narcotics. He ambulated in the halls, continued to make
steady progress and was discharge to home with All Care VNA.  He
will follow-up Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his PCP and cardiologist as an
outpatient.
