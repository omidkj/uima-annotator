Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1070**]
Chief Complaint:
Clotted AV graft

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral hemodialysis line placement
Left femoral line placement
Incision and drainage of abscess x2
Revision of AV graft
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
63 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems including
HIV, HCV, ESRD on HD, who presented to the emergency department
with clotted left sided AV graft, resulting in inability to
receive HD. Patient otherwise at baseline, denying systemic
complaints of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or
shortness of breath. Patient was afebrile in the ED. IV access
was difficult to obtain, and patient refused femoral stick. Labs
were obtained through ABG, which revealed K 5.2, for which
patient received [**Doctor First Name 233**]-exalate. Transplant surgery consulted in
ED, plan for intervention in AM. Admitted to medicine given
complicated medical history.
.
Of note, patient recently discharged on [**2125-1-12**] after admission
for leukocytosis. He was found to have an anterior chest wall
abscess at the site of a previous HD fistula with subsequent
incision and drainage of the abscess by surgery. The patient was
discharged to finish a 14-day course of vancomycin (started
[**1-4**]), last received dose on [**2125-1-17**].

.
Chest CT ([**1-22**])
New 2.5 x 2 cm fluid collection with air-fluid level consistent
with an abscess along the course of a resected segment of the
right dysfunctionalized loop catheter. There is evidence of
infection tracking along the residual loop catheter superiorly.
The entire extent may not be accessed on this study. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
.
Left Arm AV Fistulogram ([**1-25**])
Left AV fistulogram and ultrasound Doppler showed completely
thrombosed AV fistula.
.
Fluoroscopy Guided Placement/Replacement/Removal of Central Line
([**1-26**]):
Uneventful exchange of a short temporary, for a long permanent /
'tunneled' femoral hemodialysis catheter, as above. The catheter
is ready to use.
.
Tunneled Cath Placement ([**2-2**]):
1. Successful exchange of previously placed right femoral
catheter for a new 55 cm 14.5 French dual lumen tunneled
hemodialysis catheter via the right common femoral vein with
termination in the upper IVC at the T11/12 interspace level.
2. Unable to perform AV fistulogram and thrombectomy
intervention at this time, as above.
3. Left IJ vein small in caliber with apparent occlusion
inferiorly, thus tunneled neck line not placed.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Previously seen small abscess in the right subcutaneous
tissue appears smaller on today's study, with small amount of
residual stranding.
2. Loop graft in left subcutaneous chest with surgical staples.
3. No focal consolidation seen within the lungs. No masses
identified. Small amount of extrapleural fat seen in the right
side. Bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Interval worsening of previously described destructive
changes within the spine.
5. Large hiatal hernia.
.
CT Head:
FINDINGS: Image quality is slightly degraded due to patient
motion. Allowing for this, no intracranial mass lesion,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures is apparent.
There is a chronic left pontine lacunar infarct. Mild mucosal
thickening in the posterior aspect of the sphenoid sinus is
present. There is bilateral atherosclerotic calcification of the
cavernous carotid arteries. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are within normal limits. There is thickening of the
posterior pharyngeal soft tissues, possibly secondary to
increased lymphatic tissue, but infectious etiology cannot be
entirely excluded, as opposed to a neoplastic process. Osseous
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Chronic left pontine lacunar infarct.
3. Thickening of the posterior pharyngeal soft tissues, which
could be secondary to increased lymphatic tissue. An infectious
etiology cannot be discriminated from a neoplastic disorder.
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular
systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2125-2-7**], no major change is evident.
