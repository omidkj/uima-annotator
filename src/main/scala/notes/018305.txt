History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is an 85 year-old gentleman with a history of
Parkinson's disease who presented to the ED after a fall.

The pt was not able to give a history at the time of my
encounter. Therefore, the following is per the ED staff.

Apparently, the pt was last seen well around 11pm. His wife
found
him at approximately 3am in the bathroom lying on the floor with
a laceration above the left eye. EMS was called and he was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation. No EMS trip sheet was
left in the ED.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2201-6-28**] 2:47 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: worsening sputum production

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old man with SAH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
worsening sputum production
ADDENDUM:

Findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the phone by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of dictation.
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Increased sputum production in a patient
with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH WAS COMPARED TO [**2201-6-26**], AND
CHEST CT FROM [**2201-6-26**].

The heart size is normal. There is no change in mediastinal
contour. There is also unchanged appearance/mild improvement of
lingular consolidation, but new opacity in the right lower lobe
is demonstrated, which might be consistent with developing
infection/aspiration. The known right upper lobe spiculated
lesion is again demonstrated suspicious for pneumonia as well as
the right apical lesion, which was described on the recent CT
torso but not optimally visualized on the current radiograph.
The retrocardiac atelectasis is again noted.

The ET tube tip is 8 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in
the proximal stomach.

IMPRESSION:

New right lower lobe opacity, which might be consistent with
developing pneumonia/aspiration.

Unchanged lingular consolidation.

Known right upper lobe lesions concerning for neoplasm.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2201-6-27**] 11:08 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: assess for interval change.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old man with SAH, SDH.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for interval change.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 85-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural
hemorrhage. Assess for interval change.

COMPARISON: [**2201-6-26**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained
without IV contrast.

FINDINGS: There has been no significant interval change in the
diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage seen within the cortical sulci
as well as a layering hemorrhage within the lateral ventricles
bilaterally. No new foci of hemorrhage are identified. The
ventricular system is unchanged in size from the prior study.
There is no edema, shift of normally midline structures, or
acute major vascular territorial infarction. Again demonstrated
is a small amount of prominent right extra-axial space, which
could represent a small subdural hygroma on the right, similar
in appearance to [**2201-6-26**]. Visualized paranasal sinuses
demonstrate fluid within the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally, as
well as mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus. Osseous
structures are unremarkable. There is soft tissue hematoma
overlying the left frontal region.

IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the subarachnoid and
intraventricular hemorrhage compared to [**2201-6-26**] at 2:15
p.m.
2. Stable small right frontal extra-axial fluid collection,
likely reflecting a hygroma.
3. Left soft tissue hematoma overlying the left frontal region.
4. Mild sinus disease as noted above.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2201-6-26**]  3:44:54 AM


Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior
fascicular
block. Baseline artifact makes interpretation difficult. No
previous tracing
available for comparison.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2201-6-26**] 3:46 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: FOUND DOWN, LAC ON FOREHEAD. ? BLEED.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old man with found down in bathroom with lac on
forehead, increasingly unresponsive.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
bleed?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 85-year-old male found down with laceration on
forehead.

COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the brain
without intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were
performed.

FINDINGS: Rounded hyperdense material is seen along the right
frontal falx, and right tentorium consistent with subdural
hematoma. There is linear high- attenuation material tracking
within sulci in the bilateral frontal lobes and right sylvian
fissure consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is
prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with
age-related involutional change. There is no shift of the
normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarct. Periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensities consistent with sequela from chronic microvascular
ischemia. There is a moderate soft tissue hematoma along the
superior margin of the left orbit. No radiopaque foreign bodies
are seen. Multiple hyperdense fluid levels are seen within the
sphenoid, ethmoid and left maxillary sinus likely representing
blood products. Small amount of fluid is also noted within the
frontal sinus. Findings are concerning for underlying fractures
and a facial bone CT is recommended for further
characterization.

IMPRESSION:
1. Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage as above. No evidence
for shift of midline structures or hydrocephalus.
2. Moderate left frontal soft tissue hematoma and multiple fluid
levels in the paranasal sinuses, concerning for underlying
fractures. A facial bone CT is recommended for further
characterization.
3. Atrophy.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2
