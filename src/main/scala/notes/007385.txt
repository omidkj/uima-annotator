History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old woman with DM2, ESRD on HD, CAD who
presents with dypsnea and worsening epigastric pain and is
admitted to the MICU for hypoxia. She was recently discharged on
[**2114-2-8**] after presenting similarly with dyspnea. During that
hospitalization, she underwent aggressive HD and was treated for
a COPD exacerbation with a 5 day course of levoflox and
prednisone.

She was doing well until yesterday when she developed acute on
chronic worsening of nausea and epigastric pain thought to be
related to chronic pancreatitis and possible mesenteric ischemia
in the setting of vascular diseae. This progressed overnight and
this morning she developed dsypnea and presented to the ED. She
denied fevers and chills. +"Chest pain" as she points to her
epigastrium. Also with a a chronic cough productive of yellow
sputum that is unchanged x weeks. She had [**Date Range 2286**] last on
Saturday, [**2114-2-10**], and 1L was removed, compared to 2-3L, the
volume typically removed at [**Hospital1 18**]. She also reported a few loose
nb bowel movements yesterday.

In the ED, vital signs were initially: 98. 164/77 84 16 79%ra.
She was placed on NRB and reportedly was satting 88%5L. CXR was
consistent with pulm edema/volume overload and renal saw her
with a plan to dialyze tomorrow. She was put on 100%NRB and
started on a nitro gtt; aspirin 325, levoflox 750, and dilaudid
were given. A right EJ was also placed. She was then admitted to
the MICU.

On arrival to the floor, ultrafiltration was initiated. She also
requested dilaudid for her abomdinal pain. O2 sat was in the 90s
on 4L.

Studies:

[**2114-2-12**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial
abnormality. Inferior (question posterior) myocardial infarction
of indeterminate age but may be old. ST-T wave changes. Cannot
exclude myocardial ischemia. Since the previous tracing [**2114-1-27**]
the rate is faster. Otherwise, there is probably no significant
change but baseline artifact makes comparison difficult.

[**2114-2-12**]: Chest Xray: Cardiomegaly, new mid-to-lower lung
pulmonary opacities may represent pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia.
Correlate clinically and follow up as indicated.

[**2114-2-13**]: Chest Xray: Patchy band-like opacities bilaterally as
well as prominence of the septae shows moderate improvement
compared to yesterday's examination consistent with fluid
overload improvement. Heart is enlarged. Minimal patchy
retrocardiac opacity is without change.

[**2114-2-15**]:
EGD: Enlarged gastric folds (biopsy taken), abnormal mucosa in
the stomach, normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy taken),
otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Colonoscopy: There was diffuse spasm of the colon throughout
colonoscopy making the procedure very difficulty. (biopsy taken)
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

[**2114-2-16**]: MRCP: 1. Pancreatic divisum, unchanged. No definite
evidence of acute pancreatitis. However, exam is limited as
there is no intravenous contrast administered.  2.
Hemosiderosis.  3. Bilateral renal cysts and atrophic left
kidney, similar in appearance.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old woman with DM2, ESRD on HD, CHF,
and CAD who presented with dypsnea and worsening epigastric
pain.

#. CHF exacerbation: She originally presented with dyspnea,
oxygen requirement, markedly elevated BNP, and evidence of
volume overload on physical exam and chest xray.  It was felt
that she had an acute exacerbation of her chronic systolic and
diastolic CHF.  She had been receiving outpatient [**Known lastname 2286**] and
likely needed more fluid removed per session.  She had
significant improvement after ultrafiltration.  She was
initially admited to the MICU and then subsequently transferred
to the floor after improvement in her respiratory status.  She
was continued on her home Lasix dose and additional doses of IV
Lasix were given with little effect as she is mostly anuric.
She was weaned off oxygen and her respiratory status remained
stable.

#. Abdominal pain: She has had an extensive workup for
epigastric pain in the past with no obvious cause.  She has
known pancreatic divisum and her pain on admission was
originally thought to be due to chronic pancreatitis.  She
continued to have epigastric pain that did not improve with NPO
status and IV fluids and she was seen by the gastro
