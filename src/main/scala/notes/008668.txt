History of Present Illness:
80 yo F with gastric adenocarcinoma which was found after she
was hospitalized for a COPD flare and was found to have iron

a 4cm malignant appearing mass on the ant antral wall.  The mass
was biopsied and was poorly differentiated adenoscarcinoma.

It was decided that her gastric cancer was likely resectable and
she was seen in consultation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as by her

intestinal and diffuse types with focal signet ring cell
morphology.
-[**1-7**] lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinom

Brief Hospital Course:
OPERATIONS DURING ADMISSION
[**2-2**] Subtotal gastrectomy

CONSULTATIONS DURING ADMISSION
Infectious Disease
Gastroenterology

PERTINENT PATHOLOGY
I.  Distal stomach, partial gastrectomy (A-Y):  Invasive
adenocarcinoma, mixed intestinal and diffuse types with focal
signet ring cell morphology; Chronic inactive gastritis with
intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia; Margins of excision are
free of invasive carcinoma
II.  Unremarkable duodenal segment.
III.  Omentum with no carcinoma seen.
IV.  Lymph node, left gastric (Z): Two of twelve lymph nodes
positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma

V.  [**2-14**] Stool - Salmonella enteriditis

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY DATES/MAJOR EVENTS
[**2-2**] The patient was taken to the OR for a subtotal
gastrectomyl; she tolerated the procedure well.  She was then
taken to the SICU, extubated postoperatively in SICU.  She
developed slight post-op delerium that resolved upon her
transfer out of the SICU.  She maintained her fluid status well
- no hypotension or signs of overload in spite of AS.
[**2-3**] On POD 1 her cordis was removed.  In her post-op delerium
the pt removed both NGT and PIV; the PIV replaced but the NGT
kept out given the fresh anastomosis.
[**2-4**] Unfortunately, the patient developed emesis and was then
noted to desaturate to the 80s - likely aspiration - CXR was
unremarkable.  Her O2 sats eventually recovered to RA without
antibiotic intervention.
[**2-6**] She was started on her home meds - nifedipine, valsartan,
hydrochlorthiazide, nebulizers for COPD.  She was transferred to
the floor.
[**2-8**] She was started on clears and the foley discontinued.
[**2-9**] Her diet was advanced as tolerated; nutrition consulted for
post-gastrectomy diet.  Unfortunately, that evening after eating
the patient developed nausea and emesis and profuse diarrhea;
she was made NPO with IVF; her symptoms thought to be secondary
to advancing her diet.
[**2-10**]  A KUB was taken given her symptoms that was unremarkable.
Unfortunately, she developed profused diarrhea - up to 16
BM/day, without fevers, and intractable nausea/emesis requiring
anti-emetics throughout the day.
[**2-11**]  The diarrhea continued; C diff stool samples sent during
the prior days were neagtive x3.  Ova, parasites, and multiple
other
[**2114-2-11**]  Given her symptoms and inability to tolerate PO intake,
a PICC was placed for TPN, and she was started on TPN.  She
underwent an UGIS that revealed no leak.  The diarrhea started
to slow up, but she was still having [**6-2**] loose green BM/day.
Gastroenterology was consulted for the diarrhea; they felt that
this was secondary to an infectious etiology or a
post-gastrectomy syndrome.
[**2-14**] The fecal stool sample grew out Salmonella species!
Infectious Disease was consulted; ID suspected that the patient
was likely a carrier prior to surgery and that the stress of
surgery/intraop abx had allowed for growth of the bacteria.
They recommended bld clx, TEE for concern with salmonella
bacteremia, and they recommended starting the patient on
ceftriaxone given her age.
[**2-15**] The TTE done for Salmonella bacteremia (without
vegetations).  The diarrhea began slowing up though the patient
was without significant rx yet.  The patient's diet was
advanced.
[**2-17**] ID recommended discontinuing the ceftriaxone and starting
cipro 500 [**Hospital1 **] x through [**2-21**] (7 days total); they signed off
given that her diarrhea was resolving.  Unfortunately, the
patient once again developed recurrent emesis after eating
meatloaf, and so her diet was decreased to clears.
[**2-18**] The Salmonella speciated to S. enteriditis.  The patient
was given [**Location (un) **] crackers, which she tolerated well.  She
tolerated bland foods in the postgastrectomy diet; she was
started on calorie counts.  She underwent a rehab screen given
PT recs, but case management discovered that her insurance did
not cover rehab.  She developed soft stool again, and her stool
was sent for C dif.
[**2-19**] The patient began walking more.  She tolerated her diet,
though was still eating little.  She was diuresed x1 given the
volume of TPN.  Her stool more solid; the C dif was negative.
The patient was also seen by OT, who actually recommended that
she go home with family helps w/ADLs.
[**2-20**]  Her TPN was cycled.  Once again the patient amulated well,
multiple times.  Calorie counts still only 600/day.  The patient
and her family once again counseled on PO intake,
post-gastrectomy diet.
[**2-21**] TPN cycled again and the volume halved.  The patient
continued to ambulate well.  Calorie counts improved.  Meds all
changed to PO.  The patient was noticed to become more anxious
and was treated with low dose ativan.
[**2-22**]  Pt had nausea responsive to Zofran sublingual.
[**2-23**] PICC removed and pt was discharged home with services

The patient was kept on DVT prophylaxis (SQH) and PPI throughout
her stay.
