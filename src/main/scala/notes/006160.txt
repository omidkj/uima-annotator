Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
A.C.E Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 72F with Afib, asthma, CHF, pacer, diverticulitis, BIBA
after falling on her R leg in the bathroom. No LOC. Did not hit
head. Also, c/o 6 days epigastric abd discomfort, 1 day SOB, and
6cm R leg laceration.
.
In the ED: Initial vitals: 96.5, 80, 126/94, 21, 98% on 2L. Had
Lac repair. CT abdomen concerning for ischemic colitis but
surgery opting for medical management. They asked for ICU
admission to optimize her hemodynamics for a concern for
alow-flow state. Cardiology did not think she has a low-flow
state given normal renal function. Given Cipro/flagyl for
empiric coverage. Nebs, morphine. HD stable the entire ED stay.
Admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of hemodynamics as
recommended by surgical consult.
.
On arrival to the ICU, it was difficult to obtain a history
through a phone translator. The patient was tearful,
increasingly anxious and confused. Did not complain of any
abdominal pain, CP, SOB. On further questioning she admitted
that she had abdominal pain previously, but not during time of
interview. Did complain of pain at laceration site.
Her son phoned the ICU and was able to provide more information.
Stated his mother usually received her care at [**Hospital1 2177**], that she was
hospitalized there recently and had been quite ill, requiring
intubation for "water in her lungs...a problem with her
pacemaker." She was there for ~2.5 weeks, discharge about 2
weeks ago. He thought that since then she had been complaining
of abd pain, no associated n/v/d, no fevers. She had presented
to [**Hospital1 2177**] ED several days ago with same and was discharged from the
ER. DPTA she had gotten OOB to BR during the night and had
falled and cut her leg which precipitated this presentation.
.
ADDENDUM: per conversation w/ [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP on [**2-15**]: Pt had ICD
placed at end of [**Month (only) 359**], presented mid/end of [**Month (only) 1096**] w/
SOB/CP - found to have pericarditis [**2-6**] to procedure, put into
right heart failure (most recent ECHO EF 30%) intubated for
several weeks. Had enlarging pericardial effusion which resolved
w/out window. She was d/c-ed to [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (son works
there), there for 11 days, went home this past Weds; at home
visit Thurs/Fri was fluid overload, got 40 lasix those two days.
Saturday was seen at [**Hospital1 2177**] ED for abd pain (has been c/o abdominal
pain for years), neg ABD CT, had O2 sats in 93-95%.
.
Of note, pt very anxious at baseline. Doesn't use O2 at home but
is on CPAP set @17-18. Med list and recent D/C summary will be
faxed to SICU (CC6C) but [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] pt is on Cozar 50,
Lopressor XR 100, Synthroid, Clonopin 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **], ASA, Zoloft 50.

Pertinent Results:
Chest U/S [**2-15**]: Small fluid collection in the region of left
chest wall
pacemaker.
CXR [**2-15**]: Slight increase in right hazy lower lung zone opacity
representing pleural effusion.  Similar appearance of remainder
of chest since yesterday.
R LE tib/fib [**2-15**]: Very limited assessment of the right ankle
joint is grossly unremarkable.  No subcutaneous emphysema is
seen.  No soft tissue loss is identified.  No abnormal
periosteal reaction is evident.
Echo [**2-15**]: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated right ventricular
cavity with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-2-12**], the left
ventricular systolic function is slightly improved. Right
ventricular cavity size, systolic function and estimated PA
systolic pressure are similar.
CT head [**2-14**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift
of
normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarct. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent
with age-related involutional changes.  There is no calvarial
fracture or soft tissue abnormality. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
CT abd/pelvis [**2-14**]: CT OF THE PELVIS:  Sigmoid colon and rectum
are decompressed, with sigmoid diverticulosis.  The distal
ureters, bladder, and adnexae are normal. Patient appears to be
post hysterectomy.  An unusual clustering of left inguinal lymph
nodes (2:93) is unchanged from comparison of [**2176-4-10**]. There are
no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.  Multilevel
degenerative changes involving the lower thoracic and lumbar
spine are noted. CT ABD: Nonspecific colonic wall thickening
involving the splenic flexure, raising the possibility of
ischemic colitis from a low-flow state in this watershed region.
Infectious etiologies are possible, though less likely given the
focality of this finding. Marked cardiomegaly with distention of
IVC and reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins
suggesting elevated right heart pressure. Increasing small
bilateral pleural effusions, with partial loculation of the
right-sided effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis. Diverticulosis of
the right, left, and sigmoid colon.  No diverticulitis.
CXR [**2-14**]: No definite areas of consolidation, although if
indicated right
lower lobe opacity may be followed with repeat PA and lateral
chest x- ray.
