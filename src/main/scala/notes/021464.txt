History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53 yo male with history of depression who presented to
[**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2187-7-3**] after overdosing on 2 weeks worth of
a multitude of drugs including celexa, wellbutrin, ativan,
gabitril, concerta (ritali) in addition to drinking EtOH all
night. Pt was found lethargic at home and was taken to [**Hospital1 3325**]. At the OSH, pt was able to give history. He was then
given charcoal, had a changing mental status, and was intubated
for airway protection. He was also started on amiodarone/
lidocaine/ bicarbonate after going in to a wide complex
tachycardia. Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] was then sent by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**]. On
arrival to [**Hospital1 **], pt had a  wide complex tachycardia (V-tach vs.
SVT with BBB). Attempt x 3 was made on cardioversion which did
not work. Pt was given bicarbonate and then the QRS narrowed and
he spontaneously went into sinus tachycardia. Serum toxicology
was (-) and negative for TCA. Urine + benzos. In MICU, pt was on
bicarb drip which was eventually d/cd and he was extubated on
[**2187-7-4**]. Toxicology and MICU feel as though concerta was the
culprit of the cardiac rhythm. Pt was febrile to 102 on [**2187-7-4**]
and CXR showed LLL effusion vs. consolidation. Pt was started on
levaquin.
*
On further history, pt says that he was suicidal that day. It
was "semi-planned" in that he "knew what was going to happen."
He says that he had been thinking about suicide for months, and
that things were not going right. Adding to this was patients
increasing debt and he felt like he could not take care of
things as he should. He is seen by a psychiatrist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 62984**] 1-3 times a month mainly for pharmacologic treatment of
anxiety and depression. On admission to the general medicine
floor, he denies SI or HI.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Drug overdose
-Toxicology believed that ritalin was the most likely cause of
pt's wide complex tachycardia. Methylphenidate labs were pending
when this was written. In the MICU and on transfer to general
medicine floor, pt was monitored on telemetry and there were no
events. Telemetry was d/cd on [**2187-7-6**]. Toxicology and cardiology
were heavily involved in patient's care until he was stable and
transferred from the MICU.

2. Psychiatry
-Psychiatry evaluated patient and believed that he has major
depressive disorder, severe without psychotic features. Pt was
kept on 1:1 sitter and his psychotropics were held. After pt was
not requiring oxygen anymore, he was transferred per psychiatry.

3. Pneumonia
-Pt spiked a fever on [**2186-7-3**] and CXR showed a LLL pneumonia. He
was started on Levaquin and will continue it PO after d/c from
medicine floor for a total course of 7 days (last day [**2187-7-10**]).
Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] required nasal cannula oxygen to maintain his oxygen
saturations in the low-mids 90s. The oxygen was weaned down over
the first 3 days and then pt tolerated room air. He was satting
in the mid-upper 90s on ambulation upon discharge.

4. Asthma- Continued albuterol, salumetrol, and fluticasone
inhalers. Also continued singulair.
