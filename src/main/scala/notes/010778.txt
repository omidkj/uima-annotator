NCHCT [**2154-1-1**]:
large left and smalle right cerebellar hemorrhages of unclear
etiology, though
underlying mass cannot be excluded. Edema cause mass effect on
the 4th
ventricle, though it remains patent without frank hydrocephalus
though there
are no priors for comparison. Chronic small vessel ischemic
changes with old
left temporoparietal infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 M, transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for L cerebellar
hemmorrhage as outlined in the HPI. He was monitored overnight
in the ICU, where his neurological exam remained unchanged (mild
dysarthria, LUE and LLE ataxia, and mild L tricep weakness). His
SBP was controlled in the 130 to 160 range. He was then
transferred to the floor.

His neurological exam remained stable.

His course was complicated by UTI and he was treated with
bactrim. He also went into slight CHF exacerbation but recovered
with a dose of IV lasix.  His mental status and overall clinical
picture has continued to improve.  He should be kept at a
balanced fluid status in order to avoid further CHF
exacerbation.    He was started on a full aspirin and should
continue this indefinately.
