Admission Date:  [**2110-11-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-11-13**]


Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old lady
with a history of COPD, congestive heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea who was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2110-11-10**] with a COPD
exacerbation and CHF exacerbation.  The patient reports some
dietary indiscretions in the week prior to admission.  She
reports eating out at both Chinese and Italian restaurants.
However, the patient denied weight gain or lower extremity
edema during this time.  She does note that she was having
increasing shortness of breath, lethargy, and tremor over
this time.  In addition, the patient has felt increasingly
"groggy" over the week prior to admission with the increased
need to take naps.  The patient reports that she has baseline
exertional dyspnea, becomes short of breath after walking
only a few steps.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient denied
any chest pain, worsening cough, fevers, chills, nausea, or
vomiting.  She did report that she had stopped using her
Albuterol inhaler approximately two weeks prior to admission
as she felt that it was making her vision blurry.  The
patient reports that she does not use home oxygen although
her physician had recommended it.

The patient's daughter attributed the patient's symptoms of
increasing lethargy, shortness of breath, and tremor to
worsening hypercapnia and brought her mother to the Emergency
Department for further evaluation.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient was initially saturating 43% on room
air.  She received Lasix 20 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, and
levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. times one.  The patient was placed
on oxygen with a goal to keep her oxygen saturation between
90 and 92%.  Her arterial blood gas in the Emergency
Department was 7.28/77/51.  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.

During her admission in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient was diuresed to be 1 liter negative each day.  She
was continued on oxygen.  She was started on antibiotics and
a steroid taper for COPD exacerbation.

On [**2110-11-11**], the patient was transferred to the floor for
further treatment.

1.  COPD.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Diastolic congestive heart failure.
4.  Grave's disease, status post x-ray therapy.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Sleep apnea.
7.  Right breast cancer, status post radiation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her daughter.  She
had an 180 pack year history of smoking.  She reports that
she quit several years ago.  The patient does not currently
use alcohol but has drank approximately two to three drinks
per week in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99, blood pressure 157/50, heart rate 73, respiratory rate
34%, oxygen saturation 78%.  General:  The patient was a
comfortable appearing elderly lady in no acute distress,
speaking in full sentences.  HEENT:  The pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  Clear oropharynx.  JVP approximately 11 cm of water.
Lungs:  Bilateral crackles approximately two-thirds of the
way up the lung fields.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  There was 1+ bilateral lower extremity
edema.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 10.8,
hemoglobin 13.1, hematocrit 40.8, neutrophils 73.2,
lymphocytes 21.9, monocytes 4.6, eosinophils 0.1, basophils
0.2, platelets 192,000.  PT 23.5, PTT 36.4.  INR 3.6.
Glucose 128, sodium 142, potassium 4.7, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 35, BUN 35, creatinine 1.1.  CK 83.  Troponin T
0.07.  Calcium 9.5, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 2.0.  TSH 1.4.

Chest x-ray:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal.
The mediastinum was otherwise unremarkable.  There was a
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  Bilateral pleural
effusions were present.  There were faint opacities at each
lung space, most likely representing atelectasis.  The
osseous structures were unremarkable.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm with atrium premature beats and a
first-degree AV block.  Marked left axis deviation, left
ventricular hypertrophy, most likely no change since the
previous tracing of [**2109-9-16**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient
was with probable diastolic congestive heart failure
exacerbation most likely secondary to dietary indiscretion.
Throughout the admission, the patient was aggressively
diuresed with IV Lasix to be 1 liter negative per day.  In
addition, she will be discharged on IV Lasix at a dose of 20
mg p.o. on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.  The
patient was continued on oxygen to maintain her oxygen
saturation between 91 and 93%.  She will need to be
discharged on oxygen.

The patient was continued on her calcium channel blocker.
She was prescribed a low-sodium diet with a 1,500 cc per day
fluid restriction.  The patient's shortness of breath
improved symptomatically throughout admission.  In addition,
her oxygen requirement decreased dramatically.

2.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION:  The
patient received IV Solu-Medrol during her stay in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Upon transfer to the floor, the
patient was started on a prednisone taper.  She was started
at 80 mg p.o. q.d. and will be tapered to 10 mg p.o. q.d.
over the next several days.  In addition, the patient will
complete a seven day course of azithromycin.  The patient was
continued on her Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers during the
admission.

3.  PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient was in
normal sinus rhythm during most of the admission. She was
continued on her calcium channel blocker for rate control.
Initially, on admission, the patient's INR was elevated so
her Coumadin dose was held for the first several days.  She
was restarted on her Coumadin 2.5 mg on [**2110-11-12**].  Her
coagulation levels continued to be monitored.  The patient
will be continued on Coumadin following discharge with close
follow-up of her INR.

4.  HYPOTHYROIDISM:  The patient was with normal TSH on
admission.  She was continued on her home Synthroid dose
throughout the admission.

5.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
continued on a low-sodium diet with a fluid restriction of
1,500 cc during admission.  Aggressive electrolyte
replacement as needed.

6.  REHABILITATION:  The patient was evaluated by Physical
Therapy who believed that rehabilitation would be helpful for
her.

7.  CODE STATUS:  The patient is full code.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility on oxygen where she can receive
physical therapy.
