Aside from several regions of subsegmental atelectasis at the
right base, lungs are clear, though low in volume. There is no

gastrointestinal gaseous distension present in the upper abdomen
raises concern for small-bowel obstruction.

In the interval there has been improvement in the degree of
vascular engorgement with the lungs appearing clear.
Nasogastric tube has been removed. Right-sided jugular central
venous catheter is in unchanged position.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on
[**2184-12-24**] for prophylactic operation to prevent recurrence of
diverticulitis. The patient underwent laparoscopic sigmoid
colectomy, splenic flexure takedown, rigid sigmoidoscopy, which
initially went well (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor NPO on IV fluids, with a foley
catheter in place, and a Dialudid PCA and Toradol IV for pain
control. The patient was hemodynamically stable.
.
Postoperatively, initially he did well, but he began spiking
fevers.  His white blood cell count dropped, his urine output
dropped, and he began to have a septic etiology.  He was
pan-cultured, started on empiric antibiotic therapy, and given
aggressive IV fluid rescusitation. Concern for an anastomotic
leak was raised.  A chest x-ray showed evidence of
pneumoperitoneum. The patient was [**Last Name (un) 4662**] back to the Operating
Room on [**2184-12-28**] and underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesions,
omentectomy, washout of abdomen, drain placement and abdominal
closure, which went well without complication (see Operative
Note). After a prolonged PACU stay where he was extubated, he
was transferred to the TICU. He arrived NPO with an NG tube, on
IV fluids and IV Zosyn and Vancomycin, a foley catheter and 2 JP
drains to bulb suction were in place, and he recived Fentanyl
for pain control with good effect. Post-operative fluid overload
and associated hypertension was treated with IV Lasix for
diuresis as well as Metoprolol and Hydralazine with good effect.
He was transitioned back to home Labetolol and Clonidine was
started. The NG tube was removed. While in the TICU, he began to
notice some (L) ankle pain.
.
On [**2184-12-31**], the patient was transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9. Pain
was initially well controlled with a Dilaudid PCA, which was
converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The patient was started on sips of clears upon transfer, which
was progressively advanced as tolerated to a low fat, heart
healthy regular diet by [**2185-1-3**] with good tolerability. The
foley catheter was discontinued the morning of [**1-2**]. The patient
subsequently voided without problem. IV antibiotics were
discontinued on [**2185-1-1**]. Both JP drains were discontinued on
[**1-4**] as their output was low. The incision with staples remained
clean and intact. He was transitioned back to his home
anti-hypertensive medications with good BP control.
.
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive
spirrometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were
used during this stay. The patient's blood sugar was monitored
regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale insulin was
administered when indicated.  By discharge, he was started back
on home Metformin for diabetes. Labwork was routinely followed;
electrolytes were repleted when indicated.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating his diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  He was discharged home wihtout services. The
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions
with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge
plan.
