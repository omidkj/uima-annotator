Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
ilesotomy takedown

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2159-2-27**] A ileostomy closure with lysis of adhesions and
ileocolonic anastomosis
[**2159-3-6**] Placement of PICC line


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82-year-old
female with stage IIA (T3, N0, M0) cecal carcinoma status
post right hemicolectomy and end ileostomy on [**2158-12-8**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 853**] who presented with worsening of ileostomy
retraction, stenosis and skin breakdown.  She was seen by
stoma nurses at home who expressed concern that there was
nothing to be done to further prevent leakage and undermining
of her stoma.  She denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
had just a pulling feeling on her skin near her ostomy and
was still having ostomy output 8 times in 24 hours.  After
review of the risks and benefits with the patient regarding
an ileostomy closure, she gave her consent and she was
brought to the operating room.

[**2159-2-27**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. There is a late transition which is probably
normal. There are small R waves in the inferior leads consistent
with possible infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-12-7**] ST-T wave changes
are no longer present and inferior R waves are smaller.

[**2159-2-28**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2159-3-4**]
CT abd and pelvis:
1. Status post recent ileostomy takedown with right lateral
abdominal wound and underlying subcutaneous fluid collection,
which could be a postoperative seroma, given timeframe.

2. Right hemiabdominal enterocolonic anastomosis without
definite evidence of leak. However, oral contrast has not yet
reached the anastomosis, limiting assessment. Consider delayed
exam. Small amount of associated
pneumoperitoneum and fluid are likely postoperative.

3. Small fat-containing incisional hernia.

[**2159-3-5**]
CT abd and pelvis:
1. No extraluminal oral contrast identified; however, there is
increased
extraluminal gas compared to next preceding study suggesting an
anteriorly
located bowel wall leak given the intraluminal air-fluid level
seen at the
anastomosis and continuation of extraluminal gas with small
bowel loop.
Surrounding inflammatory changes evident though no focal fluid
collection
identified.
2. Stable trace perihepatic ascites.
3. Stable small right pleural effusion with compression
atelectasis.

[**2159-3-8**]
CXR
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next
preceding similar
study of [**2159-3-6**]. The left-sided PICC line has been
pulled back by a few centimeters and is now seen to terminate
just below the level of the
carina. This implies a pull-back by approximately 5 cm. The
present
termination point corresponds to the mid portion of the SVC and
excludes the possibility of mechanical contact with cardiac
structures. No other new cardiopulmonary vascular abnormalities
are identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room electively for
ileostomy takedown and subsequently admitted to the surgical
floor. Intra-operatively extensive lysis of adhesions was
performed to take down the Hartmans. She tolerated the procedure
well, was extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.
In the PACU her UOP was noted to be marginally low and she was
sent to the floor NPO and with IVF. She was started on
Clindamycin post operatively.

On POD 1 she was transferred to the ICU with Acute Kidney
injury. Pre renal according with FENA, creatinine 1.9 from 1.3
[**Year (4 digits) 5348**]. Patient was given IVF resuscitation with crystalloids
and Albumin. U/o increased to 30-40 cc/h. Creatinine remained
stable. She had an ECHO performed that showed EF >55% but severe
pulmonary HTN. At this time she was on PCA for pain control and
her abdominal incision dressings were dry. She was restarted on
steroids, which she had been taking every other day, at her home
dose. On POD 2 and 3 she continued to have marginal but improved
UOP and was given boluses intermittently and 1 unit of pRBCs for
hct 22.3. Her respiratory status remained stable on exam and by
CXR and she was transferred back to the floor on POD2. She was
advanced in her diet and was switched to PO medications. On POD
4 her wound developed some erythema and a few staples were
removed and swab was done and small amount of fluid expressed.
This swab was sent for micro and eventually grew Proteus and
Enterococci. At this time the clindamycin was stopped and she
was started on Vancomycin and cefpodoxime. Through POD 4 into 5
she had an acute increase in oxygen requirement that responded
well to nebulizer treatment but in this setting her wound was
noted to have more induration and most of the remaining staples
were removed. The fascia was intact on exam but more murky fluid
was expressed and the wound was packed. At this point her
antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. She had
a CT scan done on POD 5 that showed no evidence of contrast
extravasation at the anastamosis however ther
