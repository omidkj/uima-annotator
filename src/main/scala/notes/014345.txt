NYHA II, AF with PPM insertion, no hx of CAD who presents from
[**Hospital3 1196**] with chest pain and elevated TnT in
the context of an admission with acute cholecystitis.
.
Patient had 1 week history of RUQ pain whcih was severe and
intermittent. This began on [**5-28**] when she had RUQ pain for 2
days and this spontaneously resolved. Patient then had no pain
until [**6-2**] when RUQ pain into back returned. Pain waxed and
waned until becoming progressively severe over the last 48 hrs.
She complained of nausea but denied vomiting, fever, chills, or
diarrhea. She then presented to NWH on [**6-3**] for her pain.

for acute cholecystitis discovered on U/S with gallstones,
sludge (ultrasonographic [**Doctor Last Name 515**]) and no significant bile duct
dilatation. Patient was started on Pip/Tazo, IVF and had pain
control with Dilaudid. Overnight the patient did well but had
chest pressure at roughly 0500 (per daughter) this morning
([**6-4**]) with no ECG changes. Chest pressure was without radiation
and this was in the context of feeling hot, there was no SOB,
sweating or radiation. Labs drawn at the time of chest pain
showed a troponin increase from 0.01 to 0.78 (Troponin I: 0.01
-> 0.78 -> 0.59). The chest pain resolved with dilaudid and
patient continued to have no ECG changes. An urgent cards
consult was obtained and they requested a cath procedure prior
any intervention for the cholecystitis. The patient remained
chest pain free for the entire morning and received a full dose
Aspirin this AM.
