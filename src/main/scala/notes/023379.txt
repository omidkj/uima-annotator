by her pulmonologist for hypoxemia and somnolence.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 2450**] [**Known lastname 6930**] has a long history of respiratory failure,
stemming from her underlying disease as well as previously

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for OSA,
CHF, HTN admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure, left
against medical advice after evaluation by psychiatry.
.
#  HYPERCAPNIC RESPIRTORY FAILURE:  Patient with chronic
hypercapnia due to untreated OSA and COPD (increased v/q
mismatch) as well as hypoxia from volume overload.  Altered
mental status in setting of hypercarbia.  Unclear precipitant
for this acute episode, though CHF was likely playing a role.
Patient has a history of non-compliance with medications (i.e.
diuretics) and her dietary history is not known.  Unlikely to be
PNA without a fever, white count, or sputum production.  COPD
exacerbation is likely also contributing, though patient does
not sound that tight or wheezy on exam.  In the ICU, Ms. [**Known lastname 2450**] [**Known lastname **] was diuresed with good effect.  She was continued on
steroids and frequent nebuilizers.  Ms. [**Known lastname 2450**] [**Known lastname 6930**] was
encouraged to use BiPap but she refused.  She also refused ABGs
in the ICU.  She was transferred to the medicine floor, and
agreed to wear bipap overnight.  On the second day on the
medical floor, she insisted on leaving "AMA."  Psychiatry was
called to reassess capacity.  She was determined to have
capacity after it was confimred with [**Hospital3 **] that she
does have a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1023**] [**Last Name (Titles) 99971**] medications.  She left with
instructions to take lasix 60mg twice daily and prednisone
taper.  She was encouraged to stop smoking and wear nicotine
patch.  She was aware of the risk of recurrent hypercarbic
respiratory failure and possible death if she did not stay in
the hospital to continue therapy.
.
# CHF, acute diastolic:  Preserved EF with evidence of diastolic
dysfunction.  Likely volume overload contributing to this
current presentation.  It's unclear how compliant patient has
been with current cardiac medications and/or heart failure diet.
 Patient was continued on [**Last Name (Titles) **], ACE-I, BB, statin, diuretics, and
imdur.  She was given lasix boluses while in the ICU.  She was
discharged with instructions to take lasix [**Hospital1 **].
.
# HYPERTENSION:  Patient was continued on ACE-I, BB, diuretics,
and lasix.
.
# DM2, uncontrolled with complications:  Insulin sliding scale
during admission, discharged with metformin only.  Patient may
benefit from insulin upon discharge.
.
# DEPRESSION:  Fluoxetine and aripiprazole were continued.
.
# GERD:  Omeprazole was continued.
