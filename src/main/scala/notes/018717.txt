tendo-achilles lengthening.  Pt has history of a R third
metatarsal head resection in [**Month (only) 404**] and additional debridement

40
years ago (5 pack-year history), drinks wine occasionally

Family History:

Physical Exam:
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no nuchal rigidity
Respiratory: CTAB, no wheezes/rhonchi/rales - coarse
upper airway sounds
Cardiovascular:	 RRR
Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, + BS
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally. Right foot is post-op without
any noted discharge or blood on
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.


Pertinent Results:
CT SCAN OF THE RIGHT ANKLE AND DISTAL LOWER LEG WITH CONTRAST.

INDICATION: 76-year-old man status post right transmetatarsal
amputation with
poor healing and wound drainage. Persistent fevers.

TECHNIQUE: CT scan of the right lower leg and ankle was
performed with
intravenous contrast. Images were acquired in the axial plane.
Coronal and
sagittal reformats were created and reviewed. No comparisons.

FINDINGS: Post-surgical changes of the mid foot are seen
following
transmetatarsal amputation. At the distal aspect of the foot,
there is a
large rim-enhancing fluid collection that represents either
postoperative
seroma or abscess. There is extensive rim enhancement and
reticular edema of
the residual mid foot as well. Evaluation of the underlying
osseous
structures is suboptimal but no definite evidence of frank
erosion is seen
apart from the post-surgical changes following previous
osteotomy. Osseous
alignment is preserved.

There is lucency at the medial aspect of the talar dome that
could reflect
overlying osteochondral abnormality. There is edema along the
medial aspect
of the ankle. Dense atherosclerotic vascular calcification is
seen. Within
limits of technique, the tendons are grossly intact. No
additional loculated
fluid collection is identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large loculated, rim-enhancing fluid collection in the foot
adjacent to
the metatarsal amputation sites. The possibility of infection
must be
excluded.
2. No definite evidence of underlying osseous abnormality to
suggest
osteomyelitis, although evaluation is severely limited by the
previous post-
surgical changes in this area.
