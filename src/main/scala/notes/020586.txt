Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, nausea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] YO F HTN, HLD with 3 weeks of abdominal pain and 1 day of
nausea and weakness who was found to have anterior ST elevations
[**Hospital 90006**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for possible
cardiac catheterization. The patient presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on
[**3-27**] at which time she was found to have a narrow complex
regular tachycardia with rate in the 130s-140s and SBP in the
80s. The patient was also noted to initially be "non-verbal".
Due to concern for SVT, the patient was given 6mg IV adenosine
as well as IV metoprolol. She "converted" to sinus rhythm with
SBP in the 130s. An EKG was done and showed ST elevations in
V2-V4 so IV heparin was started (guiac + brown stool), rectal
aspirin was given and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
possible cardiac catheterization.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, a code STEMI was called. Her initial VS
were 134/85  RR 17  100% on 2L NC. She was alert and oriented.
Her labs were quite concerning given pH reported as 7.05 with
lactate of 7.9, leukocytosis to 22K. Trop 0.07. Her u/a showed
>100 WBCs and + leuk esterase. Two 18g PIVs were placed and she
was given 2L NS. Interventional cardiology declined urgent cath.
The CCU fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt the patient was more
appropriate for MICU admission.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient denies complaints. Her
nausea has abated and she denies any abdominal pain today. She
denies fevers, cough, dysuria or rashes. She only endorses
"post-nasal drip." She has had several days of diarrhea for
which she believes her doctor gave her a "purple pill."

Past Medical History:
hypertension
hyperlipidemia
hypothyroidism
left hip replacement

right tibial plateau fracture


Social History:
The patient lives alone. She ambulates with a walker. She denies
tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.

IMAGING:
[**3-27**] CRX: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. P-R interval
prolongation. Left axis deviation. Consider left anterior
fascicular block. Small R waves versus Q waves in leads V1-V2.
Consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction, especially with
mild ST segment elevation in leads V1-V2. Other ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2169-3-27**] CXR: Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal
in size given the portable AP technique. There is mild
tortuosity of the aorta. Lungs are essentially clear.
.
[**2169-3-27**] KUB: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern. No free air.
.
[**2169-3-27**] RUQ U/S: No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Cholelithiasis without definite evidence of cholecystitis.

[**3-28**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**3-27**], there is little
overall change. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of
normal without vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Mild
tortuosity of the descending aorta with calcification in its
wall is again seen.

[**3-28**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 75%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild-to-moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline/mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal (normal pulmonary artery pressure in the
presence of right ventricular pump dysfunction should not be
taken to indicate normal pulmonary vascular resistance). There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

[**3-28**] LENIS:
1. 4.1 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm right [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
2. No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremities
.
[**3-28**] CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral acute pulmonary emboli with mild straightening of
the
intraventricular septum suggesting right heart strain.
2. Right lower lobe consolidation which in the setting of acute
pulmonary
embolism could represent infarction.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta
which is
normal in caliber.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with HTN, HLD, presenting with abdominal pain, nausea and
weakness found to have anterior ST elevations, leukocytosis, and
transaminitis. Her CTA demonstrated bilateral pulmonary
embolisms.
.
#. Pulmonary embolism: The patient found to have bilateral PEs
on CTA chest, and had evidence of RV dilation and free wall
hypokinesis on TTE.  She was continued on heparin gtt, and it
was felt that patient's hypoxia was likely secondary to PE and
possible RLL infarct seen on chest imaging. The patient's INR
was not therapeutic on the day of discharge, so she will
continue Lovenox at the rehabilitation facility until her INR is
therapeutic.
.
# ST elevations: ST elevations in V1-V3, ST depressions in
V5-V6, with troponin leak were concerning for STEMI. Troponin
peaked at 0.6 and was downtrending. Patient was continued on
ASA, metoprolol, and heparin gtt. Echo showed a dilated RV
cavity with severe global free wall hypokinesis. Cardiology was
consulted and felt EKG changes more suggestive of RV strain than
STEMI.  CTA chest confirmed presence of bilateral PEs.  Patient
continued on heparin gtt, though given lower concern for ACS,
plavix was not started.  Patient remained CP free, and ST
elevations on EKG resolved.
