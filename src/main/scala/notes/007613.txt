HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 31394**] is a 53-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, type 2
diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
pulmonary embolism, obesity, and sleep apnea who was admitted
to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2184-6-25**] complaining a
week-long history of shortness of breath, a cough productive
of greenish sputum, and intermittent chest tightness.

Of note, the patient also has a history of chronically
elevated creatine kinases, as well as a history of numerous
prior admissions for chest pain.  A cardiac catheterization
in [**2182-7-11**] revealed middle left anterior descending
artery stenosis of 80%, for which the patient underwent
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting.
Subsequent catheterizations have revealed this and other
major coronary vessels to be patent.

Shortly after arrival at [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2184-6-25**], the patient's chest pain recurred and he was found to
be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response,
a rhythm that the patient reported was unprecedented for him.
The patient was given a beta blocker, diltiazem, and heparin.
The patient was found to have a troponin of 0.2 at the
outside hospital and reportedly, on the basis of this finding
(and the [**Hospital 228**] medical history), he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization on [**2184-6-26**].

Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm.

Following admission to [**Hospital1 69**],
the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed
n significant obstructive coronary artery disease, though
markedly elevated pulses and elevated right-sided and
left-sided filling pressures were found.

Status post catheterization, the patient was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit Service due to concern regarding his
hemodynamics.  Subsequent echocardiography did not reveal any
evidence of pericardial effusion.  The patient's brief
Coronary Care Unit course was uncomplicated, and he was
called out to the Medicine Floor on [**2184-6-27**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease;  cardiac catheterization in
[**2182-7-11**] revealed a middle left anterior descending
artery stenosis of 80%, status post percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stenting to this stenosis.
Subsequent cardiac catheterizations have shown patent
vessels.
 2.  History of elevated creatine kinase in the absence of
cardiac ischemia; troponins were normal.
 3.  Pulmonary embolism "years ago."
 4.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
 5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 6.  Obesity.
 7.  Sleep apnea.
 8.  History of chronic elevated creatine kinase and CK/MB.
 9.  Hyperlipidemia.
10.  Carpal tunnel syndrome.
11.  Barrett esophagitis.
12.  Status post cholecystectomy.
13.  Status post ventral hernia repair.
14.  Status post back surgery.
15.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking and drinking.  He
is married.  His wife works at [**Hospital6 33**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease and diabetes
mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  (Per admitting
Coronary Care Unit resident)  Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 96.9, heart rate of 97, blood pressure
of 101/54, respiratory rate of 21 per minute, saturating 95%
on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed
oropharynx was clear.  Cardiovascular revealed distant first
heart sound and second heart sound.  No murmurs.  Chest
revealed decreased breath sounds, prolonged expiratory phase,
clear.  Left chest wall pain on palpation.  The abdomen was
obese and soft.  Liver edge palpable 4 cm to 5 cm below the
right costal margin, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities revealed trace pitting edema posterior
tibialis bilaterally.   No clubbing or cyanosis.  Pedal
pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Complete blood
count revealed a white blood cell count of 9.2, hematocrit
of 34, platelets of 369.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 136,
potassium of 3.6, chloride of 93, bicarbonate of 33, blood
urea nitrogen of 46, creatinine of 1.4, blood sugar of 68.
Calcium was 10.4, magnesium was 1.6, phosphorous was 6.1.
Albumin of 3.1.  Liver function tests revealed an AST of 32,
ALT of 27, LD of 23; creatine kinase was 606, with a MB
fraction of 28; alkaline phosphatase of 77, total bilirubin
of 0.4, troponin of less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital
revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 149 beats per
minute with poor R wave progression.  Subsequent study on
[**2184-6-26**] revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of 95 beats per
minute.

Other laboratory data of note included cardiac
catheterization on [**2184-6-26**] which revealed no significant
obstructive coronary artery disease, moderate-to-severe
pulmonary hypertension, severely elevated biventricular
filling pressures, low cardiac output (cardiac index of 1.6).

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As described above, the patient was
initially admitted to the Coronary Care Unit following
cardiac catheterization.  He did well there and remainder
hemodynamically stable.  Thus, he was transferred to the
Medicine Floor on [**2184-6-27**].

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was fairly
uneventful.  He was maintained on a heparin drip while
beginning long-term anticoagulation with Warfarin for his
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Because of the patient's occasionally elevated blood sugars,
the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Service was consulted; and on [**2184-6-29**], they recommended starting NPH and changing his regular
insulin sliding-scale.

On the morning of [**2184-6-29**], the patient was noted to be
somewhat somnolent.  For the latter part of the previous
night he had not slept with his BiPAP; the patient reported
that he is often "groggy" when he misses his BiPAP.  An
arterial blood gas revealed the following:  A pH of 7.35,
PCO2 of 53, PO2 of 65, with lactate elevated at 4.5.  The
patient was placed back on BiPAP and subsequently felt (and
was noted to be) much more alert.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Vital signs were stable.  He had
some mild chest wall tenderness to palpation; unchanged from
baseline.
