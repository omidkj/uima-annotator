HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 3315**] is a 40
year-old man with a past medical history of greater then two
month of lower extremity swelling and chronic shortness of
breath for which he has not received medical attention who
presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Room on [**6-2**] with progressive increasing shortness
of breath with exertion over time and marked weight gain
greater then 50 pounds in the months prior to admission.  The
patient denied any specific trigger for worsening weight
gain.  Review of systems was significant, however, for
snoring, question of some apnea at night.  The patient does
sleep during the day.  He denies paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea or chest pain.  He does state that he has
a "mild cough" for two months that is nonproductive.  He does
have dyspnea on exertion after one block whereas at baseline
approximately on year ago he was able to walk extended
periods of time for extended distances without similar
discomfort.  The patient does states that he has had nocturia
approximately once per night, but this was continued for some
time.  The patient also states he had some subjective fevers
or chills, but it did not measure his temperature at home.

In the Emergency Room the patient's pulse oxygenation was
noted to be 70% on room air, which went to 99% on 12 liters
by nasal cannula and arterial blood gas was a pH of 7.28,
PCO2 78, PO2 176.  A chest x-ray showed mild to moderate
pulmonary edema.  In the Emergency Department the patient was
diuresed with Lasix times 700 cc after receiving 20 mg of
intravenous Lasix.  At that time the patient was refusing a
Foley.  Additionally, the patient does endorse drinking three
to four drinks of hard alcohol a week having previously had
five to six drinks a night of alcohol approximately one year
ago.  He has also been taking in unknown over the counter
diet drug.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Obesity, parents describe a question
of congenital heart abnormality or slightly large heart at
birth.  Congenital left eye abnormality with a left eye
prosthesis, eczema, gout involving her toes several years
ago, alcohol abuse.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  No medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3315**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13419**] from college.  He
runs a company.  He is still living with his parents.  He
denies a history of sexual activity or tobacco or drug use,
but does endorse alcohol use as described in the history of
present illness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile 98.0.  Pulse
102.  Blood pressure 150/96.  Respiratory rate 24.  Pulse
oxygenation 100% on nonrebreather after 70% on room air.  In
general, the patient is sitting up in no acute distress,
breathing with a face mask speaking in full sentences.
Extraocular movements intact with a left eye prosthesis.  The
patient was noted to have jugulovenous distention to his ear
with positive hepatojugular reflex.  Cardiac examination was
unremarkable with a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Normal S1 and S2.  The patient was noted to
have bilateral wheezes inspiratory and expiratory on lung
examination with occasional scattered crackles.  On abdominal
examination he was noted to be obese with pitting edema
throughout the abdomen.  The abdomen was nontender and it was
markedly distended.  On extremity examination the patient had
bilateral 4+ pitting edema with weeping of the edema.  His
legs were erythematous bilaterally and he also was noted to
have erythema on his legs, abdomen and back.

DATA:  CBC at the time of admission revealed a white count of
11.3, hematocrit 51.7 with a differential of 74% neutrophils,
13% lymphocytes, 12% monocytes, platelets 287.  Coags on
admission PT 14.3, INR 1.4, PTT 32.5.  Chem 7 sodium 142,
potassium 6.7, although this was hemolyzed.  Chloride 100,
bicarb 36, BUN 32, creatinine 1.4, glucose 102, ALT 28, AST
43, amylase was 75, total bilirubin 0.6.  Repeat liver
function tests on [**6-8**], ALT 18, AST 23, alkaline phosphatase
64, total bilirubin 0.5.  Calcium at admission was 8.7,
phosphate was 6.8 and magnesium was 1.9, albumin of 3.3.
Total iron binding capacity was 321, ferritin 170,
transferrin 247.  TSH was measured at 2.8 and 1.6 on [**6-3**] and
[**6-4**] respectively.  Tox on [**6-2**] was negative for alcohol.
Lactate on blood gas on [**6-3**] was 0.9.  Free calcium on [**6-3**]
was 1.13.  Blood cultures were sent on [**6-5**] and have shown no
growth to date.  Urinalysis on [**6-5**] showed greater then
100,000 organisms of staphylococcus aureus and 10 to 100,000
organisms of Enterococcus pan sensitive on both accounts.  A
chest x-ray was performed on [**6-3**] and showed mild evidence of
congestive heart failure.  The lennies were performed on [**6-3**]
and showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

A repeat chest x-ray was performed on [**6-6**], which was the
most recent at the time of this dictation demonstrated poor
lung expansion, right zone infiltrate could not be excluded
at that time.  An electrocardiogram was performed on [**6-2**],
which showed marked left axis deviation possible old septal
infarct, sinus rhythm.  An echocardiogram was performed on
[**6-3**] and was suboptimal in quality, because of the patient's
body habitus and subcutaneous edema.  The conclusions were
image quality limited, left atrium normal, mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular cavity size
normal, overall left ventricular systolic function normal
between 60 and 70% LVEF.  Aortic valve not assessed.  Mild
systolic doming and borderline diastolic prolapse of the
aortic valve leaflets raises a strong possibility of a
bicuspid or other nontrileaflet aortic valve.  Mild aortic
regurgitation was seen, small pericardial effusion.  No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  Right ventricular was
not optimally visualized, but appears dilated and
hypocontractile on very limited views.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the above
history directly to the Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit
on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] on [**6-2**] where the patient was continued
with diuresis and arterial line was placed for monitoring of
systolic blood pressure in the left radial artery without
incident.  The patient did receive lennies, which were
negative to rule out deep venous thrombosis as noted above.
Echocardiography though limited by pronounced edema did
appear to show evidence for right heart failure.  The
patient's right heart failure was attributed to a combination
of alcohol use and/or sleep apnea and an abbreviated sleep
study was performed in the Intensive Care Unit and the
patient was begun on BiPAP overnight for presumed sleep apnea
after apneic periods were noted.  The patient continued to be
diuresed and gradually required increasingly lower amounts of
oxygen until at the time of transfer to the floor.  On [**6-5**]
he was sating in the low 90s on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula.  Chest x-ray as stated above was noted to be
improved with respect to pulmonary edema at the time of last
study.  Although the possibility of right middle lobe
pneumonia could not be excluded the patient is currently
afebrile.

At the time of transfer to the flor on [**6-5**] the patient was
still noted to have pitting edema to the flanks bilaterally
with tense edema in the legs bilaterally and diuresed several
liters a night on his current regimen of Lasix 40 mg
intravenous b.i.d. prior to the time of this interval
dictation.

The medical team consulted the Congestive Heart Failure
Service on [**2128-6-8**].  Preliminary recommendations at this
time include sleep study, pulmonary function tests, weight
loss, complete abstinence from alcohol, blood pressure
control with ace inhibitor or beta blocker, consideration of
Digoxin for heart failure, consideration of Aldactone and
continued cautious use of Diamox.  Also under consideration
is the possibility of setting the patient's heart with
ca
