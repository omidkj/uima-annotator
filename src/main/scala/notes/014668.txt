History of Present Illness:
72 year-old female with past medical history of idiopathic
pancreatitis, asthma, T2DM, hyperlipidemia, HTN, recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-7**] after being tx'd from OSH for
further evaluation of pancreatitis. Per her last discharge
summary, she had a CT scan at the OSH on [**2-19**] which demonstrated
new pancreatitis. On [**3-12**] a CT of thorax demonstrated multiple
low density lesions in the pancreas suggestive of pancreatic
pseudocysts, and a f/u CT on [**3-15**] revealed phlegmon like changes,
particular to the head of the pancreas. The final CT on [**3-22**] at
the OSH showed worsening cystic changes. There was no elevated
in amylase and lipase and her biliary ducts were normal. CA [**58**]-9

was normal from her last admission. There was concern for
autoimmune pancreatitis given her history of asthma and a IgG4
level is pending. CFRT mutation was negative.
.
She was transferred from rehab the day of admission with
abdominal pain. The patient describes her pain as a pressure
throughout the abdomen, [**9-20**], non-radiating. The pain is
similar to her prior episode of pancreatitis. The pain occurred
acutely and awoke the patient from sleep. The pain is now 0/10
after receiving morphine in the ED. The patient states she has
baseline abdominal pain, [**2-18**], relived by percocet. She denies
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, BRBPR. Her last bowel
movement was the day prior to admission. She complains of
subjective fevers. She last ate the evening prior to admission.
Of note, the patient was to have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the day after admission. The patient also complained of SOB and
wheezing relieved by combivent nebs.
.
In the ED, VS 100.6 119 134/69 25 93%RA. In the ED she received
levofloxacin 750 mg x 1, flagyl 500 mg x 1, 2 L NS, morphine 4
mg x 1, tylenol 650 mg x 1, combivent nebs x 3.
.
ROS: As above. Denies CP, cough, dysuria. Review of systems
otherwise negative in detail.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2147-4-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Distended gallbladder that contains sludge. No evidence of
cholecystitis is noted including no gallbladder wall edema, wall
thickening, pericholecystic fluid.
2. Complex cystic structure is seen medial to the gallbladder
arising from the pancreatic bed. This corresponds to the
pseudo-cysts that were seen on pancreatic bed. However the
suspecious focus of air mentioned on CT was not seen on the this
cystic structure.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2147-4-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. The pancreas has been replaced by innumerable pseudocysts
that extend beyond the pancreatic bed as above. The foci of air
in some of these pseudocysts and within the remnant uncinate
process, along witht he peripancreatic stranding, suggest acute
on chronic pancreatitis. Air also may be introduced by
instrumentation (ERCP), but unlikely in this case. Correlate
with history of such procedure. The presence of innumerable
cysts may also be due to underlyng IPMN, and workup to exclude
it may be pursued once acute presentation resolves.
2. Findings at the lung bases appear new compared to CT from
[**2147-3-31**] and are suggestive of either multilobar pneumonia versus
aspiration. Close clinical correlation is recommended.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2147-4-13**]
IMPRESSION: Stable left pleural effusion with left basilar
atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation or superimposed
edema. Limited examination due to positioning. If clinically
feasible, consider PA and lateral views in the radiology suite
for better evaluation.
.
[**2147-4-21**]: Colonoscopy:
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
There was liquid stool throughout the colon. There was no fresh
or old blood seen in the colon.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: Repeat screening colonoscopy as an outpatient
to look for small polyps that may have been missed.
.
[**2147-5-1**] right upper extremity ultrasound:
REPORT: There is normal compressibility, augmentation, and
respiratory variation within the deep veins of the right upper
extremity. It should be noted that the patient's PICC line is
within the cephalic vein and there is definitely thrombus
surrounding the cephalic vein, but this does not appear to
extend proximally into the axillary subclavian region. It does
not appear to be entirely occlusive.
CONCLUSION:
PIC in right cephalic vein with surrounding clot, which does not
appear to extend proximally into the axillary or subclavian
regions. Small amount of flow is identified surrounding PICC.
.
[**2147-5-2**] CT Pancreas:
CT ABDOMEN: Few images through the lung bases demonstrate
bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions,
relatively unchanged from [**2147-4-26**].
There has been near total replacement of the pancreas by
multiple cystic collections. These extend inferiorly along the
mesentry, as well as via the foramen of [**Location (un) 45041**] into the
retroperitoneum on the right. Some of these cystic collections
have foci of air, and some have areas of mixed attenuation (4,
25), which could represent hemorrhage and/or infection. However,
the amount of air in this collection is unchanged from the prior
study.
There is no ascites. Spleen, liver, gallbladder are normal in
appearance. The parenchyma of both kidneys enhances
symmetrically. Small stone is seen in the right kidney,
unchanged.
CT PELVIS: Foley catheter is present in the bladder. A small
amount of free fluid is seen within the pelvis. There is
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without diverticulitis.
Degree of anasarca is unchanged, and there is increased
subcutaneous edema in the left flank.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Multiple cystic lesions in the pancreas are
relatively unchanged in size. Some of these have foci of air.
This finding too is unchanged from the prior study. There is no
free air in the abdomen.
.
[**2147-5-3**] Right upper extremity ultrasound:
FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, there has been interval removal of
the
right-sided PICC line.  The previously described right cephalic
vein clot is not visualized on the current study.  Evalu
