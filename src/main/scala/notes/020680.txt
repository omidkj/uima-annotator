Admission Date:  [**2166-12-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2166-12-11**]


Service:  CCU

She was transferred for a valvuloplasty.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman with a history of aortic stenosis, presented to
[**Location (un) 11790**], [**Hospital 792**]hospital on [**12-3**], with acute
onset of shortness of breath.  She was found to be in new
onset atrial fibrillation with resultant CHF.  She given
Diltiazem for rate control and Lasix for diuresis.  An echo
at the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 53%
and aortic valve area of 0.3 cm with a peak gradient of
approximately 130.  She was transferred on [**12-8**], to
the CMI service in preparation for catheterization and
possible valvuloplasty on [**12-9**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic stenosis, 17-18 mmHg gradient by echo with a valve
area of 0.3.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Retinal detachment.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol use.
She is a widow and lives alone.  Her daughter lives nearby.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and shellfish.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs - temperature
97.6, heart rate 87, blood pressure 102/54, breathing 21,
satting at 92% on room air.  She is an elderly woman in no
acute distress.  HEENT - moist mucous membranes, pupils are
equal and reactive to light, extraocular muscles intact.
Neck exam - no JVD.  Cardiovascular exam - irregularly
irregular, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper
sternal border, harsh in character, also a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur, blowing in character at the apex.  Lungs
were clear bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities - 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally without edema.  She is
alert and oriented x3.

EKG prior to procedure normal sinus rhythm at 90, normal
intervals, ST elevations in V1 and 3, ST depressions V4
through V6, 1, AVL and lead 2.  T-wave inversions V4 through
V6, 1 and AVL, no significant changes compared with the
prior.  The patient has LVH with re-polarization
abnormalities and ST segment changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**12-9**], the patient was taken to
the cardiac catheterization lab, there was no significant
coronary artery disease on the catheterization.  The peak
gradient across the aortic valve was 86 with a calculated
valve area of 0.32 cm2.  After the intervention, which was a
balloon valvuloplasty, the peak gradient was 39 with a
calculated valve area of 0.66.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was then admitted to the CCU for close
monitoring of her hemodynamics and for complications after
the procedure.  The patient did extremely well after the
procedure.  Within 24 hours the patient was up and moving
around.  She had no complications from the procedure.  She
had no pain or ecchymoses in her groin

Physical therapy saw the patient and deemed her safe for
discharge to home.  During this time repeat EKGs demonstrated
that the patient was in normal sinus rhythm.  Lab data was
significant for a hematocrit of 33.6, platelets of 211, BUN
and creatinine of 16 and 0.5 after the procedure.  Her
coagulation studies were within normal limits.  The patient
was discharged on [**2166-12-11**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin 0.125, she was on this
medicine on admission.  The patient was also discharged on
Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  She was
instructed to start this medicine the evening of [**12-11**].

Sh[**Last Name (STitle) 37242**]a follow up appointment with her cardiologist on
[**12-19**].  She will also call his office on [**12-14**] for
an INR check.  Finally the patient was given the phone number
of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and instructed to make an
appointment with him to discuss possible valve replacement
within the next two months.  The patient initially expressed
great reluctance about her valve repair, but she was
encouraged to see Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to discuss her options.
