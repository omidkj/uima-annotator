Brief Hospital Course:
59yo male with multiple medical problems was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
for heparin bridge before and after R foot charcot joint
revision.
.
1. RLE Charcot joint
Patient had successful charcot joint reconstruction on [**2187-8-28**].
His post-operative course was complicated by transient
hypotension and was monitored in the ICU overnight after his
procedure. This was thought likely related to prolonged
sedation. Blood cultures were sent and are negative. Wound
cultures were also sent and are preliminarily no growth to date.
He was treated with IV vancomycin while hospitalized and can be
transitioned to PO linezolid for two weeks upon discharge. His
vancomycin dose was titrated to 1250mg IV bid, and his most
recent trough on that dosage was 13.6. He should follow-up with
podiatry as an outpatient on [**2187-9-3**] (appointment already
scheduled).
.
2. Chronic systolic heart failure EF 25%
He remained asymptomatic throughout his hospital course. His
antihypertensive and diuretic medications were briefly held with
his brief post-operative hypotension but most were restarted.
His creatinine increased slightly from 1.3 to 1.5. Due to this
slight creatinine bump, his lisinopril and spironolactone have
been held and his torsemide dose was decreased to 20mg [**Hospital1 **] from
40mg [**Hospital1 **]. His lisinopril and spironolactone should be restarted
and his torsemide should be increased back to his home dose when
appropriate.
.
3. Chronic atrial fibrillation
Due to his high risk of blood clots with CHADS-2 score of 3, he
was kept on heparin bridge prior and post-podiatry procedure.
His coumadin was restarted on the evening of his surgery, and
his dose was increased from 12.5mg daily to 15mg daily due to
difficulty achieving therapeutic levels. Please continue the
heparin bridge until his INR is therapeutic. He is not an ideal
candidate for lovenox due to his renal insufficiency and his
obesity. His heparin drip was at 3550 units upon discharge from
[**Hospital1 18**] and his most recent PTT at 7am on [**2187-9-2**] was 87.2.
.
4. Diabetes Mellitus
He was discharged on his last hospitalization with lantus 75 U
[**Hospital1 **], but now has increased to 85 units [**Hospital1 **] with home dose
sliding scale. HbA1C was checked to be 6.9. Sugars were
adequately controlled during the hospitalization.
.
5. OSA - patient on home CPAP machine.
.
6. Hyperkalemia
Patient's potassium was slightly elevated on the morning of
transfer at 5.3. We would recommend rechecking potassium on the
evening of transfer. Spironolactone can be restarted once
potassium levels are stable.
