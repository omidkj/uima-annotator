History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 yo male with a past medical history significant for
diabetes, hypertension, question of sarcoidosis who presented to
the Emergency Department with fever, chills, and back pain.
Patient states that he has had the back pain for months but now
the pain is more localized to his midline.  The patient states
that he has had diarrhea for the last couple of weeks but in
combination with constipation.  Pt denies any dyspnea,
diaphoresis, melena, hematuria, dysuria.

In emergency department, Mr. [**Known lastname 32118**] was febrile to 102.9.  He was
initially worked up for aortic dissection and had a CT of the
chest and abdomen.  An EKG was done after he returned from CT
and he was found to have ST elevations, .5-1mm in I, AVL and 2
mm in V2.  He was urgently taken to the cath lab where he was
found to have a 90% ostial lesion of the left anterior
descending artery, 50% stenosed circumflex artery and an 80%
stenosed right coronary artery.  Hemodynamics showed a cardiac
output of 5.76, an index of 2.44 and a sytemic vascular
resistance (SVR) of 444.  No intervention was made as patient's
left anterior descending artery lesion was near the circumflex
and there was concern for blocking left coronary ciculation as
patient was left side dominant. An intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed and Mr. [**Known lastname 32118**] was transferred to the floor for
stabilization with antibiotics for infection, and potential
evaluation for surgical revascualrization when stable.  Upon
leaving the cath lab, he became hypotensive.  He was started on
low dose dopamine but then he became tachycardic so pt was
switched to neo-synephrine with good relief.  Upon arriving to
the floor the patient had a white cell count of 25.  He was
started on empiric coverage of vanomycin, levofloxacim and
flagyl.  The white cell began trending up from 23.4 on admission
-> 26.5 -> 36.8 -> 46.1.  Later Linezolid was added when it was
found that he had a history of methicillin resistent staph aurea
(MRSA) and vancomycin resistent enterococcus (VRE) from past
wound infections.  Pt [**Name (NI) **] on the floor trended upwards from 259
-> [**Numeric Identifier 32119**] -> 3352.  Cardiology fellow called about possibility of
taking patient to cath lab in light of continued ischemia.  It
was deemed that due to pt anatomy, he was not a candidate for
peructaneous intervention.

When Mr. [**Known lastname 32118**] initially came to the floor his blood gas (ABG)
was 7.34/28/94 with a lactate of 1.4.  He was found to have a
non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. He was on a nonrebreather and
then transitioned to CPAP. A 3AM gas showed 7.25/47/131 w/
lactate of 2.1.  He seemed to be tiring and anesthesia was
called to intubate Mr. [**Known lastname 32118**]. Chest x-ray showed bilateral
patchy infiltrate. He was transitioned to low volume to mimize
barotrauma for suspected acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Other issues included a rising creatinine of 2.3 (baseline
1.5-1.8)on [**12-5**] and a question of vertebral osteomyelitis. ID
consult was obtained and the abx recommendations were followed.
He also developed hyperkalemia  and was seen by renal service
for ARF. Pt. also had a small GI bleed with NGT coffee grounds
emesis on heparin. IABP was removed [**12-6**] and treatment
continued for LLE cellulitis. He also continued lasix duresis
with periodic neosynephrine support. He was extubated on [**12-8**].
Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of CT surgery. He recommended infectious
issues be competely resolved before CABG and a myocardial
viability study. Patient contnued to have episodes of diarrhea.
He continued his courses of vanco and zosyn.CABG was scheduled
but then postponed for a rising creatinine again (2.2). Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] reviewed the high risk status of his surgery with the
patient (10-15% mortality). CABG performed on [**2160-12-18**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] with a LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM and SVG to PDA. He was
transferred to the CSRU on epinephrine, levophed, milrinone and
insulin drips.He was extubated on [**12-20**]. Pressor wean was begun
and epinephrine and levophed were off later in the day. Pt.
remained on lidocaine, milrinone, and neosynephrine drips.
Chest tubes were removed. Creatinine was 2.9 on [**12-20**]. He had an
episode of VT and had cardioversion on [**12-21**]. He was also
transfused and started on a natrecor drip. Swan was exchanged to
a triple lumen catheter on [**12-21**]. EP was consulted for recurrent
VT. Amiodarone drip was started. He also had episodes of rapid
AFib. On [**12-22**] , he had a vfib arrest and was shocked x 4. Cath
was considered but his creatinine was at 3.0 at the time and
cardiology felt it best to monitor him closely. Ischemia was not
suspected given the large area of his anterolateral
infarction.The following day it was 3.2. He continued to receive
SQ heparin for his mobility status. He remained on amio,
natrecor, and lidocaine drips and continued with zosyn. He was
diuresed with lasix drip for volume overload. On the afternoon
of [**12-23**], the pt. was reintubated for respiratory distress. He
went to the cath lab for IABP and swan placement. Heparin was
switched to IV dosing. Milrinone and neo drips were restarted.
On [**12-24**] , a Quinton cath was placed in the left femoral vein to
allow for the institution of CVVHD. He remained sedated with
propofol. TEE was performed on [**12-24**] which revealed severely
depressed LV function with EF 20-25%.A small pericardial
effusion was noted and there were multiple wall motion
abnormalities including anterolateral akinesis.  On [**12-25**], he had
a run of Afib, torsades and a 23 beat run of VT with poor
perfusion and severe hypotension. He was cardioverted and then
paced. He had 4+ BLE edema. Right DP pulse was not dopplerable
at this time, and toes were cyanotic, but warm. IABP was pulled
at 4:30AM by cardiology for the compromised circulation in that
leg.
He remained somewhat hypotensive at this time (SBP 70-80's).
Vascular surgery was called when the pulse did not return in
this foot. He continued to be severely acidotic with base excess
of minus 4 to minus 16. There was slight improvement in his
doppler signal, but ischemia with ?thrombus was considered.
Platelet count was 69K at that time with an INR of 2.3. At this
time, there was concern for his bowel circulation given his
acidosis that was not responding to therapy.

The patient remained critically ill and ischemic mesentery was
suspected by the transplant service. Mr. [**Known lastname 32118**] was seen and
evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of general surgery. He had
requested correction of the coagulopathy and additional LFTs in
preparation for emergency exploratory laparotomy. The patient
was taken to the OR on the morning of [**12-26**] and had an emergency
lap  by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  During the attempted bowel resection for
mesenteric ischemia, the patient suffered VTach and a VFib
arrest that did not respond to multiple shocks, CPR, and ACLS
protocol meds. He was pronounced expired at 10:24 AM by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] of transplant surgery.
