Chief Complaint:
Left shoulder pain
Dyspnea on exertion

Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4509**] is a 70M with hx of metastatic prostate cancer with
known metastases to the lung and thoracic/lumbar spine with
progression on multiple lines of prior therapy who presents with
left shoulder pain. Patient reports that he was attempting to
elevate himself from his wheelchair on the day of admission when
he felt a "[**Doctor Last Name **]" in his L shoulder. He developed worsening pain
in this region and an obvious deformity over his clavicle.

The patient also endorses worsening shortness of breath with
exertion over the past 2-3 days. He states that previously he
was able to walk throughout his home without significant
breathing difficulty, though has not been able to do so
recently. He is short of breath with telephone conversations and
minimal movement. He denies any associated cough, sputum
production, fevers/chills, chest pain, palpitations. He does
endorse increased leg swelling and [**1-12**] lbs weight gain.

With respect to his end-stage prostate cancer, the patient
recently discontinued treatment with XL184 ([**Hospital1 4601**] clinical
trial) on [**2194-12-11**] due to extreme fatigue. He has remained
transfusion dependent, receiving 2U PRBCs on a weekly basis over
the past two weeks. Most recently, patient received 2 units of
PRBCs for HCT 21.9 on [**12-23**]. Recent oncology notes document a
recent improvement in energy level since discontinuing XL184,
attributed to participation with physical therapy, transfusions,
and an increased dose of steroids (dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]). The
patient is aware of his end-stage status, and has expressed
interest in hospice care per heme-onc notes.

In the ED inital vitals were, 97.8 78 95/58 18 88% ra. CXR
revealed evidence of multifocal PNA vs interstitial edema
(prelim report). X-Ray of his clavicle revealed a fracture. Labs
were significant for lactate 2.5, HCT 17.8, plt 20, and INR 1.2.
He was given vancomycin X 1 and piperacillin/tazobactam X 1. VS
on transfer were: 77 104/57 27 100% on 4 liters. He was
transferred with 18G PIV X 2.

On arrival to the MICU, VS: afebrile 85 101/60 19 92%4L NC. He
has no acute complaints.

Imaging:
CXR [**2194-12-29**]:
1. Displaced left clavicular fracture, as described above. No
pneumothorax.
2. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.

L. clavicle xray [**2194-12-29**]:
IMPRESSION: Displaced distal left clavicular fracture in patient
with diffuse osteoblastic metastases. No evidence of
pneumothorax.

CT chest w/ contrast [**2194-12-30**]:
IMPRESSION: As compared to the previous CT examination from
[**2194-11-11**], there are newly appeared bilateral multifocal diffuse
parenchymal opacities. The morphology of these opacities
suggests multifocal pneumonia. The morphology is neither typical
for pulmonary edema nor for metastatic disease. No pleural
effusions. No other relevant change as compared to the previous
examination with regard to size and distribution of visible
lymph nodes and the appearance of the heart and the large
mediastinal vessels.
Diffuse metastatic bone disease that is, overall, stable, with
the exception of a newly evident displaced left clavicular
fracture.
