History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 61671**] is a 71 year old man with a past medical history
significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2150-9-25**] with a chief complaint of loss
of consciousness. Earlier that day, the patient was getting up
from a chair to get a drink when he felt faint. He states that
he fell to his knees and lost consciousness. He does not think
that he sustained trauma to his head. When he awoke, the patient
felt confused. In association with this event, the patient
denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea though he
did report significant diaphoresis and a few minutes of shaking
chills. He denies having any bowel or bladder incontinence. The
patient returned to his chair and EMS was called. EMS found the
patient to be diaphoretic with a HR in the 40's, BP 80/palpable.
He was given atropine x 2 without effect.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient's heart rate was 43 and his SBP was
105. He was started on calcium gtt and his symptoms resolved
spontaneously before he could receive glucagon for suspected
beta blocker toxicity. His SBP returned 120-130 though his heart
rate continued to be in the 40's. As such, the patient was
transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and treatment.
.
On review of systems, the patient denied any recent chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, change in appetite,
or weight loss. He denies any recent weakness, change in vision,
or change in hearing. He does note occasional spells of
"dizziness" every week or so. He has not had any recent changes
in medication. In particular, his atenolol dose has not been
changed for at least one year.
.
Of note, the patient has been taking 75 mg of atenolol for the
last year. He was told by his new PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**9-7**] to stop taking the
medication because of "low potassium" but continued to take it.
.
While in the MICU, the patient ruled out for MI with tropnin T
negative x 3. His HR initially ranged 39-46. His atenolol,
terazosin, and timolol eye drops were held. His blood pressure
was controlled with IV hydralazine. The patient developing
wheezing and was started on nebs and then advair. His
bradycardia resolved (HR 59 on leaving the MICU) and was felt to
be due to beta blocker toxicity. His work-up included an
echocardiogram which showed left atrial dilation and normal LV
function (LVEF >55%) as well as a TSH that came back as high
with a normal total T4. Based on the resolution of his
bradycardia, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 139**] B general
medical service. His terazosin and timolol were restarted and
the patient was started on a regular dose of lisinopril.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 61671**] is a 71 year old man with a past medical history
significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2150-9-25**] following a syncopal event.
.
#Bradycardia: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 61671**] was evaluated in the ED and the MICU
and his syncopal event was felt to be due to bradycardia. The
patient had negative cardiac enzymes and ruled out for MI while
in the MICU. After holding his atenolol, his bradycardia
resolved and the patient was transferred to the general medical
floor. His work-up also included an echocardiogram which showed
only left atrial dilation and normal LV function (LVEF >55%) as
well as a TSH that came back as high with a normal total T4 and
free T4. Based on the resolution of his bradycardia, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 139**] B general medical service. His
terazosin and timolol were restarted and the patient was started
on a regular dose of lisinopril. His bradycardia was attributed
to the atenolol that he was taking so he was not discharged on
this medication. The patient was recorded on telemetry as having
a run of approximately 10 PVC's twice one evening. Given his
bradycardia and recorded telemetry events, the patient was
discharged with a 24 hr holter monitor. His primary care doctor
will follow-up on the results of that study. He should also have
follow-up thyroid function tests in 6 weeks as an outpatient,
given elevated TSH, although free T4 normal.
.
#Hypercholesterolemia: The patient was maintained on his home
regimen of Atorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY as well as aspirin while
in-patient.
.
#Asthma: The patient's asthma was managed with advair and PRN
nebs. He was discharged on flovent 110 mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **] as well
as PRN albuterol nebs for wheezing.
.
#BPH: The pateint's terazosin was held while he remained
bradycardic, but was restarted when his heart rate returned to a
normal range. He was discharged on his home dose of this
medication.
.
#Hypertension: Patient was started on 5mg of lisinopril and
re-started on hctz 25 which he was already on.  He was given
explicit instructions not to take a beta-blocker (atenolol)
until instructed by a doctor to do otherwise. He will need
electrolytes and renal function checked in the next week to be
followed up by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was given prescription for this. He
reported prn use of 40mg of lisinopril. We explained that he is
not to take prn lisinopril, but rather 5 mg everyday.
