History of Present Illness:
59 year old male admitted to OSH with
chest pain. He was also drinking heavily (app. 9 beers). When he
arrived to the ED he went into Vfib arrest and was resuscitated
with compressions and shock. He converted into sinus rhythm but
was confused, agitated and combative. EKG showed ST elevation.
He
was urgently taken to cath lab, where he was found to have
complete LAD occlusion and was stented. He was intubated and
sent
to CCU. He complained of chest pain on [**7-2**] and was brought back
to the cath lab where the LAD stent was found to be occluded and
unable to wire lesion. IABP placed and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
CABG.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 - 40 %). There is apical akinesis,and HK of
the septum and anterior and inferior walls.
There is normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an IABP positioned 2 cm distal to the left subclavian
artery.

Post-CPB:
The patient is in SR, on no inotropes.
Biventricular systolic fxn is slightly improved, with an EF = 40
- 45%.
1+ MR, no AI. Aorta intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room on
[**2150-7-2**] where the patient underwent Emergent CABG x 3.   He
received Vancomycin and Cefazolin perioperatively as he was
inpatient for greater than 24 hours.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.   The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Intra-aortic Balloon Pump was discontinued
without complication.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  EP was consulted for pre-op VFib arrest and it was
decided that the patient did not require an ICD, as his arrest
was likely due to ischemia, his EF is good and he has been
successfully re-vascularized. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.   Blood pressure would not tolerate initiation of ACE
Inhibitor, but this should be considered in the outpatient phase
of recovery.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
