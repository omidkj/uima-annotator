-Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 y.o. male with history of adrenal insufficiency,
hypothyroidism, paranoid schizophrenia, and DM II presenting
with sepsis of unclear etiology.

On the day prior to admission the patient's family reports he
had decreased PO intake as well as congestion symptoms. Last
night his family noted that he was a little weak and put him to
bed. Although he did not complain of any fevers his family noted
that he was extremely cold to the touch and gave him several
blankets and heating blankets to help him stay warm. The next
day they noted that he was awake but was not verbal. Given this
he was taken to [**Location (un) **] ED. At [**Location (un) **] he was noted to be very
hypotensive to 40s-50s. He was given Solumedrol 125mng x 1, he
was also noted to be bradycardic to 40s and received Atropine.
Azithromycin, Zosyn were initiated and a HeadCT was performed
which was negative. He was also intubated and started on
Dopamine, Levophed and Neo.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was given 2gm of Vancomycin and 750mg of
Levofloxacin. He was also given stress dose steroids of
Hydrocortisone 100mg IV x 1, PEEP was increased to 10 and pt was
set on ARDSnet protocol. He also received a total of 8L of NS.
His labs were notable for leukopenia, thrombocytopenia 116,
creatinine 3.7, BUN 93. Troponin was noted to be 0.06 with a CK
of 1836 and CK-MB that was pending. Urine and serum tox were
negative. ABG obtained after intubation noted to be pH 7.28,

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 74 y.o. Male with h.o. hypothyroidism p/w septic
shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia with suspected pulmonary versus urine
source.

##. Septic Shock: Pt noted to be in septic shock on admission to
the ED on multiple pressors. Per family pt has a history of PNA
versus aspiration PNA, hospitalized three times over the past
year and also had dirty UA and ?pna on cxr from ed. Pt was
initially started on zosyn, cipro and vancomycin for broad
coverage in this frequently hospitalized pt in addition to
pressors and xygris given pt's high apache score. Stress dose
steroids were also started as pt was on dexamethasone as outpt
per his med list. Influenza antigen and legionella antigen were
sent and were negative. Pressors able to be weaned and
antibiotics switched to linezolid for VRE in urine and meropenem
for acinetobacter in sputum. Antibiotic course was completed on
[**9-26**].

##. Respiratory Failure: Pt arrived intubated in ventilatory
failure believed to be [**1-20**] pna versus ards from urosepsis. This
was complicated by fluid overload in the setting of volume
repletion. Pt's infections were treated and pt was diuresed
aggressively with resolution of pulmonary edema at time of
discharge.  Tracheostomy tube placed on [**9-26**].  Secretions
continued to be a problem so t-tube kept in place.

# [**Last Name (un) **]:  baseline Cr of 1.8-2, which slowly rose to 4.6. Etiology
was believed to be ATN secondary to hypotension in setting of
septic shock. Renal functions improved with creatinines trending
towards baseline (baseline is 1.8-2.0, at time of discharge was
2.3).  Home lasix, glyburide, flomax, lubripristone,
fenofexadine, verapamil held.

##. NSTEMI: Pt showed no ischemic EKG changes in the ED but
cardiac enzymes were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836,
CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5, troponin 0.06. TWI in I, avL, q in Lead
III, small R-wave and aVF inferiorly. Pt ruled in, likely
ischemic from his prolonged episode of hypotension. Aspirin was
initially held as pt had been started on xygris, but asa was
restarted once xygris course completed.
In future could consider adding ace inhibitor as renal function
resolves.  Did not start beta blocker given episodes of
bradycardia.

##. Bradycardia: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring atropine
in the field for HR in the 40s. Bradycardia initially thought to
likely be due to his hypothermia. However, had additional
episodes of sinus bradycardia periodically, particularly in the
evening.  Improved during hospital course, with patient
maintaining normal sinus rhythm with regular rate at time of
discharge.

# Anemia: pt??????s hematocrit trended down throughout first few days
of admission. Likely [**1-20**] a
