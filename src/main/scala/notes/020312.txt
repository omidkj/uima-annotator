History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90885**] is a 62yo female with a PMH significant for Crohn's
disease who is transferred from an OSH for management of a GI
bleed. Per patient, she was in her usual state of health until
[**2-2**]. She typically wakes up at 4am to move her bowels. She woke
up that morning and passed BRBPR. It apparently filled up the
toilet bowel. Ten minutes later, she passed more BRB. There was
no associated pain, nausea, or vomiting. She presented to the
OSH and Hct was 36.8 (last Hct in [**11-2**] was 43.3). The next day
she underwent a colonoscopy which showed the following: left
sided diverticulosis, tortuous redundant colon with excessive
looping. Blood throughout the colon but no active bleeding seen.
Fresh blood from the rectum to the anastomosis. Per the OSH
gastroenterologist, she also had an EGD which was completely
normal. She continued to pass BRB and
proceeded to have several bleeding scans over the course of her
hospitalization. Two of the three bleeding scans showed
questionable activity in the left side of the GI tract and one
study was completely normal. She proceeded to have a mesenteric
angiogram which was negative. Per OSH records, she received a
total of 17 units pRBCs. Given the persistent bleeding, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up. On admission Hct was
28.5.

[**2141-2-8**]: CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or bleeding.
2. Multiple liver lesions, most of which represent simple cysts,
but the
largest lesion is ill-defined and incompletely characterized.
Dedicated MRI
is recommended for further characterization of this lesion.
3. Left adrenal adenoma.

[**2141-2-9**]: GI BLEEDING STUDY:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of active GI bleeding over 104 minutes.

[**2141-2-9**]: Mesenteric angiography and possible embolization.
IMPRESSION: Superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric
arteriograms showing no active contrast extravasation suggestive
of active bleeding at the time of angiography. Therefore, no
further intervention was required.

[**2141-2-10**]: LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY VEINS US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occlusive deep vein thrombus in the left subclavian
vein, with occlusive superficial vein thrombus in the left
basilic vein from the elbow to the shoulder.
2. Patent left internal jugular, axillary, brachial and cephalic
veins.
3. Normal respiratory variability in the right subclavian vein,
indicating
central patency.

[**2141-2-11**]: CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONSTRUCTION:
IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal progressive enhancement in the lateral wall of the
ileum could
represent bleeding in the wall of the ileum. Differential
diagnosis includes a vascular malformation.
2. Hemangioma and multiple cysts within the liver.
3. Distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid. Clinical
correlation is recommended.

[**2141-2-11**]: Mesenteric angiography to possibly embolization.
IMPRESSION:
1. SMA and a selective ileocolic artery arteriograms
demonstrating no
evidence of active extravasation or vascular malformation.
Therefore, no
embolization was performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
General Brief Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment. On [**2-10**] patient underwent mesenteric
angiography and possible embolization, which showed no active
contrast extravasation suggestive of active bleeding at the time
of angiography. On [**2-11**] patient underwent repeat mesenteric and
iliac artery angiogram, which was negative for acute bleeding.
On [**2-11**] patient underwent abdominal CTA which showed abnormal
progressive enhancement in the lateral wall of the ileum could
represent bleeding in the wall of the ileum. On [**2141-2-13**], the
patient underwent ileocecectomy which went well without
complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics,
with a foley catheter, and Morphine PCA for pain control. The
patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received Morphine PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications (Percocet) with
adequate pain control.

CV: On admission patient was hypotensive and tachycardic
secondary to active bleeding. Patient was placed on telemetry
monitoring while in ICU. After receiving fluid resuscitation and
blood transfusions, patient's cardiovascular status improved.
The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. EKG was obtained on
[**2141-2-12**] and was grossly normal.

Pulmonary: Patient was intubated on [**2-8**] for respiratory
compromise. Patient was extubated on [**2-10**] and started on
supplemental O2 via face mask. When respiratory status
stabilized, patient was weaned off from O2. The patient remained
stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely
monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive
spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Pre-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Post-operatively patient nutrition consult was obtained
and patient was started on TPN. Diet was advanced to clear
liquids on [**2-16**], which was well tolerated. On [**2-18**] diet was
advanced to regular, patient tolerated well. TPN was
discontinued on [**1-21**]. During hospitalization patient underwent
multiple blood/FFPs and aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient
developed signs of fluid overload including bilateral lower
extremities edema. Chest x-ray was obtained and was normal (no
pulmonary edema was revealed). Patient was
