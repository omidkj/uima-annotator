Surveillance blood cultures negative
.
Sputum [**2106-6-5**]: >25 PMN, sparse GNR
.
CXR [**6-1**]:
Patient is extremely kyphotic and patient's chin obscures left
hemithorax which limits evaluation of this film. An endotracheal
tube is
identified terminating above the carina. The right lung is
clear. A
persistent opacity in the left lung base is identified and
incompletely
evaluated. A PEG tube is noted in the left upper quadrant. The
osseous
structures are grossly unchanged.
.
CXR  [**6-4**]:
Mandible and head obscure the course of the endotracheal tube
which could end in the left main bronchus. Left lower lobe is
still collapsed. Heart size top normal. Right lung grossly
clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was
febrile, in respiratory distress, tachypnic and hypoxic. On her
prior hospitalization, her code status had been changed to
DNR/DNI by her HCP Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. However, in the ED, the
nursing home paper work indicated her to be full code; the ED
called her HCP who asked her to be intubated. The patient was
fiberoptically nasally intubated given her severe kyphosis. The
etiology of her respiratory distress was somewhat unclear
