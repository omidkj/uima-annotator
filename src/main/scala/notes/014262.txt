History of Present Illness:
59 yo M with PMH CHF Ef 35% p/w worsening shortness of breath
for several weeks.  States dyspnea is similar to prior episodes
before he had his pleural effusion drained.  Also with worsened
LE edema.  With h/o Afib and pleural effusion.  Denies
productive cough, sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] had fever and chills for
months.  Has not seen a doctor for this.  Also states has been
drinking 3 pints of Vodka daily and not eating for last several
days.  Endorses DOE and intermittent chest pressure, but none
currently.
.
Initial ED VS 98.2, 32, 88/47, 15, 96/5L.  CXR with increased
pleural effusions.  Looked fluid overloaded initially but
thought he was intravascularly deplete.  Recieved 500cc IVF and

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2200-6-1**] 6:47 PM
1. Interval increase in size of moderate left pleural effusion,
with
partially loculated component along the base.
2. Increasing bibasilar opacities which could reflect
atelectasis, but
infection or aspiration are not excluded.
3. Small right pleural effusion persists.

IMAGING STUDIES:

CXR [**2200-6-1**]:
1. Interval increase in size of moderate left pleural effusion,
with
partially loculated component along the base.

2. Increasing bibasilar opacities which could reflect
atelectasis, but
infection or aspiration are not excluded.

3. Small right pleural effusion persists.

4. No evidence for congestive heart failure.

ECG [**2200-6-2**]:
Irregularly irregular rhythm with a single wider complex beat,
probably
ventricular. The dominant population shows low voltage, leftward
axis and
ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-6-1**]
the ventricular
premature beat is new. The rate is faster. QTc interval is
shorter.

CT Chest [**2200-6-7**]:
1. Increase in volume of left pleural effusion compared to prior
study with
now moderate-to-large left pleural effusion.
2. Increase in left lower lobe atelectasis compared to prior
study.
3. Patchy airspace opacification in the upper lobes bilaterally
is
nonspecific but may represent evidence for infection or volume
overload.
4. Question tiny left sided pneumothorax, more likely to
represent small
focus of aerated lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Dyspnea/Systolic Heart Failure: Patient presented with
shortness of breath. On admission it was unclear whether he was
fluid overloaded so he was given a fluid challenge which
resulted in worsened pulmonary edema and more florid evidence of
heart failure exacerbation. He was admitted to the MICU where he
requried intubation given his decompensate repiratory status
related to his fluid overload. He was aggressively diuresed with
a lasix gtt and was able to be extubated on [**2200-6-11**]. He was
transitioned from lasix gtt to large IV boluses and eventually
transitioned to oral lasix. Patient's metoprolol was also
slightly increased from home dose of 300mg daily to 375 mg
daily. He was started on an ACE inhibitor. It is unclear what
led to heart failure exacerbation. Most likely etiology felt to
be medication non-compliance. Patient's volume status and
respiratory status stable at time of discharge. We recommend he
get an outpatient ECHO and that he follow up in heart failure
clinic. Both of these appointments have been scheduled.

2) Atrial Fibrillation - The patient has atrial fibrillation
with decreased ventricular response. In CCU, his rate
controlling agents given bradycardia. By time of transfer to
floor, the patient's HR was high 70-80s.  Coumadin was not given
secondary to patient preference (he is not on coumadin as an
outpatient).  Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was started
back on a lower dose of metoprolol.  While in the MICU, he had
some episodes of tachycardia, requiring his metoprolol to
gradually be increased to 125mg po TID. He has remained rate
controlled while on the medical floor and is being discharged on
Metoprolol succinate 375 mg daily.

3) Alcohol Dependence - Reported h/o DTs with seizures.?????? Patient
states seizures are unrelated and he gets them when he's 'hot
and cold'. Patient given MIV, thiamine, folate. Put in CIWA
scale with valium, requiring 4 doses in CCU. SW consulted.  In
the MICU, the CIWA protocol was discontinued secondary to the
patient's worsening respiratory status and ultimate intubation.
While on the floor Pt was not requiring valium per CIWA scale.
Recommend that patient be connecte
