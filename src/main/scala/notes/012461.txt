Brief Hospital Course:
As above, Mr. [**Known lastname 91245**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-2**] with exposed
PTFE graft from his femoral-femoral bypass on [**9-2**] in stable
condition.  He began to spike high fevers.  Cultures were
obtained which grew out Pseudomonas sensitive only to tobramycin
and Klebsiella sensitive to meropenem from his right groin
wound.  He was also found to have klebsiella and pseudomonas in
his blood.  The infectious disease team was consulted and he was
started on Tobramycin, Meropenem, and Vancomycin.  He would
remain on this antibiotic regimen for most of his hospital stay,
and he would remain in stable condition.  He continued with
dialysis three times weekly.  On [**9-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname 91245**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a
Placement of right axillary to right profunda to below-knee
popliteal vein graft bypass, excision of left-to-right
femoral-femoral polytetrafluoroethylene graft, patch angioplasty
of right common femoral artery using bovine patch, placement of
vacuum-assisted closure dressing in right
groin wound.  He tolerated the procedure well.  Post-operatively
he would remain in stable condition on the same antibiotic
regimen.  His wound vac was changed every three days and his
surgical wound sites were changed daily.  Culture of his graft
from the operating room grew out three different kinds of
pseudomonas- two of which were susceptible to tobramycin, and
one of which sensitive to zosyn, but resistant to tobramycin.
His antibiotic regimen was then adjusted to tobramycin, zosyn,
and vancomycin.  He will continue that antibiotic regimen for
six weeks from [**9-25**].  He was discharged to rehab on [**9-28**] in
stable condition.
