History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 83-year-old female who was
transferred to us from the [**Hospital6 8283**] with
approximately 28 hours of progressive worsening abdominal
pain, nausea and vomiting. She was seen at [**Hospital6 8278**] where she was noted to have significant tenderness
on exam of the abdomen and subsequent workup showed based on
a CT scan that there was evidence of portal venous air,
pneumatosis of the small bowel, the exact length of which was
not clear based on the imaging studies that was done there as
well as a lactic acidosis, leukocytosis size 26,000 and
progressively worsening abdominal pain since the initial
presentation to the emergency room. The patient had in the
prior 24 hours had had her scheduled hemodialysis as she has
multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease and
significant atherosclerotic disease. She had undergone her
scheduled hemodialysis and thereafter had progressive
abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis, which subsequently
required her to be taken to the hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was seen and a decision was made to proceed to the OR
for an exploratory laparotomy to try to salvage any remaining
non-necrosed small bowel.  During the operation it became
aparent that the entire length of the small bowel from the
ligament of Treitz to its termination at the ileocecal valve
appeared to
be completely non-viable and necrotic.  At this time, we
replaced the intestinal contents within the abdomen and felt
that this was a non-survivable insult. We then subsequently
closed the fascia and the skin and dressed it appropriately. The
patient
was then subsequently taken intubated in stable condition up to
the intensive care unit.  After a lengthy discussion with her
husband, it was decided to make the patient CMO and she was
started on a morphine drip, extubated and expired shortly
thereafter.  She was pronounced dead at 2350, and the chief,
attending and patient's family were all notified.
