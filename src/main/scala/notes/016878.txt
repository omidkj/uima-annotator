Admission Date:  [**2155-10-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-11-1**]


Service:  [**Hospital 11212**] [**Hospital6 733**] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
Italian gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease
and 3-vessel disease by cardiac catheterization, and
congestive heart failure with systolic and diastolic
dysfunction (last ejection fraction 20% in [**2155-6-8**]) who
had a recent Coronary Care Unit admission from [**9-15**]
through [**2155-9-24**] for a congestive heart failure
exacerbation requiring intubation.  This hospital stay was
complicated by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia and bacteremia, and the patient was discharged to
rehabilitation with six weeks of vancomycin treatment.

The patient presents today with diaphoresis and weakness with
shortness of breath.  He denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
or palpitations.  He was brought to the Emergency Department
from his rehabilitation facility.

As mentioned above, on his last admission the patient had
flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation and pressors with
a difficult extubation secondary to aspiration.  The patient
was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
in his sputum and blood and was treated with vancomycin for a
6-week course.

ALLERGIES:  ACE INHIBITORS.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 1268**] with his
wife; however, he has been in rehabilitation over the past
five weeks at the [**Hospital3 537**].  Occasional alcohol.  He
quit smoking 10 years ago.  No intravenous drug use.  The
patient is from [**Country 2559**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 121/39, his heart rate was
64, his respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation
was 100% on a nonrebreather.  His weight was 87 kilograms.
In general, the patient was an elderly gentleman in moderate
respiratory distress.  Neck examination revealed jugular
venous pressure at 8 cm while the patient was at 90 degrees.
Chest examination revealed rhonchorous breath sounds
bilaterally with rales one quarter of the way up from the
bases bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  A regular
rate.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdominal
examination revealed normal active bowel sounds.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination
revealed 1+ edema bilaterally to the tibias.  The extremities
were warm.  Neurologic examination revealed the patient was
alert, awake, and oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
upon admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 19.8, his hematocrit was 35.9, and his platelets were
1056.  His potassium was 5.1, his blood urea nitrogen was 36,
his creatinine was 2.8, and his glucose was 209.
Coagulations were normal.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed
cardiomegaly that was stable from the last study, moderate
interstitial edema, and mild pleural effusions, with
worsening congestive heart failure.

Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm, right axis
deviation, left bundle-branch block, atrioventricularly
paced.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care
Unit Service for careful management of this congestive heart
failure exacerbation with unclear precipitant.  He remained
in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for two days and was
transferred to the [**Hospital6 733**] Medicine Service on
[**10-28**] in stable condition.  Below, please find a summary
of the hospital course divided by issues/systems.

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was
diuresed with intravenous Lasix and metolazone with a good
response.

The patient was placed on intravenous nitroglycerin for the
initial 24 hours of his admission, and afterload was reduced
with hydralazine.  The patient was placed on [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure initially for respiratory management
but was quickly weaned to nasal cannula.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**10-28**] which showed no
dramatic change from last echocardiogram done in [**Month (only) **].  The
left atrium was moderately dilated as well as the right
atrium.  The left ventricular cavity was borderline dilated.
The overall systolic function was unchanged at 25% to 30%.
There were several wall motion abnormalities seen.

The patient diuresed very nicely and was stabilized on a by
mouth regimen that was continued on the regular medicine
floor of Lasix 40 mg by mouth every day, spironolactone 25 mg
by mouth once per day, isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg by mouth
three times per day, Toprol-XL 25 mg by mouth once per day,
and hydralazine 25 mg by mouth four times per day.

The patient remained with crackles during this admission and
did not develop any lower extremity edema.  He was weaned to
room air with ease and was maintained off of oxygen during
his Medicine Service course.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient with
3-vessel coronary artery disease.  The patient was continued
on the above regimen with the addition of aspirin by mouth
once per day, and atorvastatin, as well as his Plavix 75 mg
by mouth once per day.  The patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction as a precipitating factor.

3.  RHYTHM ISSUES:  The patient is atrioventricularly paced.
Amiodarone was continued.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient's cultures on
[**10-27**] were positive for coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus.  An Infectious Disease consultation was
obtained, and this was deemed to be a peripherally inserted
central catheter line contaminant.  The patient was
recommended to finish his complete 6-week course of
vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia and pneumonia that was started prior to this
admission.  The patient had surveillance cultures during this
admission which were negative.  Urine cultures were also
negative during this admission.  A midline intravenous line
was placed for antibiotic infusion upon discharge.  The
patient was to have five more days of vancomycin treatment
upon discharge.

5.  CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient remained
at baseline with good urine output during this admission.
Spironolactone was held near discharge due to a creatinine of
2.8.  This should likely be restarted in the future.

6.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit trended downward
during his admission.  The patient was found to be iron
deficient on laboratories, and oral by mouth supplementation
was started.  In addition, on [**10-27**], intravenous an iron
treatment was infused.  The patient has not had a workup of
this anemia and will need an outpatient colonoscopy.  He was
