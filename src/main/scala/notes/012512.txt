Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was protecting his airway
with no signs of impending seizures. He was continued on valium
per a CIWA scale. He was switched to an ativan drip on [**2193-9-21**]
for persistent CIWA scale from [**11-1**] and high valium
requirements. The drip was at 1.5 mg/hr with titration to CIVA
<8.  Patient was sedated on this drip and he was transitioned to
oral valium over the next few days. The drip was turned off on
[**2193-9-24**]. On [**2193-9-24**], he was noted to have increasing secretions
with elevated temp to 102.8 and a ?RLL infiltrate on xray. He
was cultured and thought to have a possible aspiration
pneumonia. He was started on empiric treatment with levofloxacin
and flagyl. Blood cultures have been negative to date, but his
sputum grew pansensitive Strep pneumo. Patient has been afebrile
since this initial spike. He was noted to remain drowsy and
confused during his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, but w/o hallucinations.
Initially, pt was NPO, given his change in mental status and
risk for aspiration. He was given IVF, banana bag for
supplementation, as well as thiamine, folate, and a
multivitamin.

Of note, he had a transaminitis on admission, which has slowly
improved during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.  Social work consultation was made
for addictions assistance. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] course continued
[**Date range (1) 56992**]/04, and then he was called out to the general medical
floor for the remainder of his hospital course. Please see below
for floor course.

1. Alcohol withdrawal:  No valium requirement for over 48 hours
per CIWA scale monitoring. He initially had a 1:1 sitter and was
in restraints [**2-18**] agitation and pulling lines, confusion.  All
of this agitation resolved within 24 hours of his stay on the
general medical floor. He was seen by the addictions consult and
given information on alcohol detox programs. He clearly stated
he was interested in remaining sober.

2.?aspiration: Pt thought to have ?RLL infiltrate on xray and
had temp x 1 in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. His sputum culture grew pan sensitive
strep pneumo. He is on levo/flagyl for coverage of aspiration as
well as community acquired pneumonia. He will be discharged with
a prescription to complete a 7 day course of levo.

3. tranaminitis: trended down to normal during admission. Likely
[**2-18**] alcohol intoxication.

4. FEN: continued thiamine, folate, regular diet (once mental
status improved).

5. ppx: bowel regimen

6. thrush: nystatin s/s during admission with improvement

7. anemia: slow trend downward during ICU stay to 30, then 32 at
discharge. Likely was [**2-18**] alcohol abuse vs blood draws vs
dilutional (received IVF upon admission) Borderline
macrocytosis, which likely points to alcohol as etiology. B12,
folate, fe studies all normal. No evidence of GI bleed. Should
f/u as outpatient to make sure count continue to normalize.

8. dispo: discharged to home to f/u in [**Company 191**] with new PCP (he did
not have one). To also follow up with social work (per
Addictions consult).
