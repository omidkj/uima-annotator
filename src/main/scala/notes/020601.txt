Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
HA x 2 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 year old man s/p renal transplant (06/??????03)
secondary to amyloid, who felt the onset of a frontal headache 3
days prior to admission. He also noted diarrhea, malaise, and
pains in his back and legs. He decided to come for evaluation
when he failed to improve at home. At the ED, he was seen by ENT
after his sinus CT showed chronic sinusitis. A chest x ray
showed RUL pulmonary consolidation. Chest CT showed no change
but confirmed changes from aspergilloma.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] received a renal transplant in ??????03 which was later
showing signs of rejecion and was diagnosed with collapsing
glomerulonephritis with worsening renal function. Over the last
few months, he was admitted several times for hyperkalemia,
acute renal failure with baseline creatinine [**5-6**], and acidosis.
Pt on admission noted feeling very fatigued which is the similar
complaint on previous admission with hyperkalemia. Patient is
also on immunosuppressant medications for his post renal
management. In the ED, the patient??????s potassium level was
recorded as 5.8; he received kayexalate. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted
to the floor for the further management of his infections and
electrolyte imbalances.

Head CT: No intracranial hemorrhage. Obviously, lumbar puncture
with cytological analysis is necessary to exclude microscopic
quantities of hemorrhage as well as to determine whether a
meningeal infection is present.

CXR: There has been interval development of a large area of
right upper lobe consolidation. The mediastinum also appears
more widened than on the prior examination. The right hilar
adenopathy and left apical pleural thickening and scarring are
again demonstrated Cardiac silhouette appears within normal
limits.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: At the left apex, again
seen are soft tissue density opacities with crescentic segments
of air with adjacent parenchymal reaction consistent with
semi-invasive aspergellosis, which is not significantly changed
from the prior study of [**2131-6-29**]. There are bilateral ground
glass opacities, with calcified mediastinal and bilateral
calcified lymph nodes, as well as fibrotic changes at both lung
apices consistent with patient's history or sarcoidosis. There
are no pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The airways
are patent at the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. No
paracardial effusions are seen. There are coronary artery
calcifications seen. A few images through the abdomen
demonstrate some calcifications in the left renal artery.

SINUS CT: Mucosal thickening and opacification of the paranasal
sinuses, with bony changes consistent with prior history of
chronic sinus disease and prior surgery. These findings are not
significantly changed in comparison to prior study.

CXR:  An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in
satisfactory position. Calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar
lymph nodes are stable. There has been interval increase in
right pleural effusion, which is freely layering on the supine
radiograph. Bilateral areas of apical pleural thickening appears
stable. A hazy area of pulmonary opacification in the right
upper lobe is considered stable allowing for differences in
technique, and has previously been attributed to an improving
area of pneumonia.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2132-3-25**]:
1) No definite intra-abdominal abscess.
2) Progression of the markedly abnormal small bowel and
ascending colon with dilatation and wall edema. There is no
definite transition point, and these findings are consistent
with peritonitis.
3) Decreased amount of the interperitoneal air and ascites makes
bowel perforation much less likely.
4) Gallbladder wall edema, which can be correlated with the
recent ultrasound.
5) Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
6) Low attenuation regions in the liver, which could represent
fatty infiltration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is 45 yo man with MMP including failed Kidney transplant
on HD [**3-5**] amyloid, h/o sarcoid, Hep B/C/D, h/o pulm
asperigillosis, HTn, chronic sinusitis and h/o IVDU who
originally presented on [**3-10**] with frontal HA times 2 days with
back pain, malaise and diarrhea originally admitted to medical
service with suspected PNA.

Pt with long and complicated medical course over 6 weeks
inculding being on medical service twice, surgical service and
SICU stay.  This discharge summary is being composed by the
second medical service and details his stay after being
transferred back from surgery.  Surgical course as per Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 33863**] and I will attempt to outline medical course on
admission as I was not the primary team; any questions may be
adressed to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 102810**].

MEDICAL COURSE

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted with fevers and cough  with
evidence of sinusitis and pneumonia.  His cultures eventually
grew Strep Pneumoniae and so he was initially treated with
Unasyn/Azithro and this was then tailored to levofloxacin for a
14 day course.  Since his cultures all remained negative for
MRSA his vancomycin was eventually discontinued.

Other issues included Atrial fibrillation with an echocradiogram
showing a preserved Lv but evidence of an enlarged atrium.  He
was rate controlled with a beta blocker and with diltiazem as no
other combinations appeared to work. He reverted to sinus
rhythm.  Attempts were made at starting heparin for
anticoagulation but he kept having significant nosebleeds and so
this was stopped with instead the plan to start low dose
coumadin as an outpatient. He was noted to be guiaic positive
before even teh noseblled started and so an EGD was done to rule
out PUD on chronic steroids. This did not reveal significant
disease.

With respect to his renal failure his renal function continued
to decline indicating failure of his transplant.  He has known
significant thrmobosis and narrowing of his chest vessels and so
we consulted IR to see if any access was left. They felt that
given the risk of sharp cannulation in teh chest we should
proceed with either a leg access catheter or a PD catheter and
arrangements were made for him to undergo PD catheter placement.
On day of surgery he was oxygenating well, felt well with a
normal exam, and was anxious to go home.
