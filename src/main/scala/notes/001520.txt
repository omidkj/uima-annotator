Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
fluid overload

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ultrafiltration
paracentesis
pleurocentesis


History of Present Illness:
46 yo F with history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, DMII, HTN who
presented to the ED with dyspnea.
*
Ms. [**Known lastname **] states that she was originally diagnosed with CHF, as
well as afib and DM while hospitalized at NEBH in [**2114**]. She
reports no prior ETT or catheterizations, though was begun on
beta-blocker and lasix. The mechanism of her CM is unknown, and
she denies any pregnancies, ETOH use, or IVDU. She is unsure of
her dry weight, though notes that she has weighed as little as
180lbs last fall. She has not weighed herself recently, though
believes that she has gained significant weight recently
(reports '[**63**] lb weight gain over 1 week', though has not weighed
herself). She noted increased abdominal girth approximately 2
months ago, and was seen by her PCP/cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9751**], who
doubled her lasix dose from 160 QD -> [**Hospital1 **]. However, despite the
increased lasix dose, she has experienced worsening dyspnea on
exertion progressively, with worsening abdominal distension, LE
edema and PND (has stable 2 pillow orthopnea), early satiety and
decreased PO intake. SHe has not experienced any chest
discomfort or nausea. She has noted LH recently, and self d/c'd
her atenolol several days ago.
*
ED course notable for administration of lasix IV, as well as
administration of nitropaste. She was also noted to have afib
with RVR, with rates in the 100-130 range, though was not given
beta-blocker out of concern for further decompensating her CHF

Past Medical History:
CHF - diagnosed [**2114**]
CM - RV/LV systolic dysfunction, etiology unknown. No prior ETT
or Cath.

occlusion of the distal vessel with the apical LAD filling by
left to left collaterals

Brief Hospital Course:
46 year old female with CHF, atrial fibrillation, DMII, HTN, and
asthma presents with CHF exacerbation (compaint of dyspnea in
the ED) refractory to increased home lasix dosages. Admitted to
the CCU for tailored therapy after failing nesiritide on the
floor.

Cardiovascular
     Echocardiogram revealed global chamber dilation with
estimated EF 20-30%. The apex was akinetic. Additionally, there
was severe hypokinesis of the midventricular segments and right
ventricular. Valvular abnormalities included 3+MR and 3+TR.
Persantine-MIBI stress testing reported left ventricular
enlargement with depressed EF calculated at 32%. Regional wall
motion abnormalities involved the septum, apex and inferior
walls. No reversible defects were noted. No angina or ECG
changes were seen.  Diagnostic cardiac catheterization showed
single vessel disease with a discrete distal LAD 100% lesion
with collateral supply.
     A large differential for dilated cardiomyopathy was
possible; includin
