History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year old male admitted to [**Location (un) **] with congestive
heart failure (acute systolic HF) and NSTEMI. New echocardiogram
showed LVEF of 43% with mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. He was stabilized on
medical therapy and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and treatment. Cardiac catheterization here revealed
severe three vessel disease. Given the severity of his disease,
he has been referred for surgical revascularization.

Findings
Due to severe global LV dysfunction and poor SvO2 (50%),
epinephrine infusion was started immediatey after inductioon
with significant improvement inLV function. The reoprted WMA's
are being reported with the epinephrine infusion
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA. Depressed LAA
emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) No thrombus in the LAA. All four
pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Severely
dilated LV cavity. Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Severe global LV hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic apex, iferior
wall and lateral wall. There is moderate hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF =20-25 %). . The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.

POST CPB:
1. Marginally improved LV global and focal systolic function
with backgeound inotropic support. EF= 30%.

2. Mildly improved RV globa;l RV systolci function.

3. Intact aorta and unchanges valvular structure and function
