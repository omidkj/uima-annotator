improvement in BP to 159/97. Pt developed progressive
respiratory distress with exam notable for crackles [**1-9**] way up
posteriorly. Patient received lasix 40mg IV x1 and was started
on BIPAP, which was d/c'd after patient vomited into the mask.
She was then placed on NRB. She also received zofran, ativan.
Initial labs notable for BUN/Cr 27/1.2, proBNP of 10,933, CK

Imaging:
Prelim MRI/MRA abdomen: No evidence of pheochromocytoma/
paraganglioma or renal artery stenosis.
CT Head:
1. Patent major intracranial arteries, without flow limiting
stenosis,
occlusion, or aneurysm.

2. White matter hypodense areas can be better evaluated with MR
[**Name13 (STitle) 430**] without and with IV contrast as these are less likely to
relate to chronic small vessel occlusive disease given the
patient's age.

3. Prominent plexus of veins in the region of the left pterygoid
muscles, with one of the tributaries having a varicose
appearance with a maximum dimension of 6mm but patent. Consult
with Interventional neuroradiologist would be helpful to assess
the significance of this findings and if any further work up is
necessary.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo W with no significant PMH presents with hypertensive
emergency and acute pulmonary edema

CV/HTN:
- Pt initially had evidence of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema
on physical exam and cxr as well as LVH on EKG. Cr was elevated
at 1.1-1.3. TTE showed moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, elevated left
ventricular filling pressures. Pt's BP was initially controlled
on labetolol drip and switched to PO labetolol. Control of BP
with PO meds required labetolol 800mg TID and lisinopril 10mg
daily. Workup for causes of secondary hypertension, including
MRI/MRA abdomen (preliminarily negative for RAS, Pheo, other
tumors), plasma metanephrines and renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] levels was negative
or pending at time of discharge. Urine studies showed Urine
protein of 18, CR of 60 for an elevated Up/cr ratio of .3.

Neuro:
- Pt complained of vertigo, nausea and vomiting shortly after
admission (immediately after begining CPAP), associated with any
movement. Physical exam was negative for any cerebellar,
vestibular or proprioceptive signs. CT head showed white matter
hypodensities and prominent venous plexus in the pterygoid
muscle, and follow up MRI showed no infarct, moderate small
vessel disease, and no signs of hypertensive encephalopathy; MRA
normal. Neuro consult found no neurologic cause for vertigo.

Medications on Admission:
ASA 81mg daily
Ibuprofen PRN
