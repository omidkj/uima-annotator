Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
85 y/o M with PMH of COPD, HTN and recent admission [**8-29**] to
[**2111-8-31**] with chest pressure (negative stress test) who
presents after 3-4 days of recurrent intermittent chest
tightness/pressure. The patient had returned home following his
prior admission and initially did well. Over the past week, he
has noted recurrence of his symptoms, along with some
dizziniess, lightheadedness and nausea associated with some of
these episodes. Saw his new cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who
repeated a nuclear stress test and echo which were reportedly
negative and given NTG for the chest pressure. The chest
pressure is associated with mild SOB and nausea. Previously
relieved by the NTG, although not entirely responsive on the day
of admission. Went to [**Hospital6 **], spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient had vitals Temp: 97.8 HR: 63
BP: 137/79 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 98. Was still c/o intermittent
chest discomfort. Troponin was negative. CBC and chem-7
unremarkable. ECG with prolonged PR but no e/o ischemia
otherwise. Seen by cardiology in the ED and sent for cath. Pt
was having chest pressure during and after the cath and was
started on nitro gtt during and post-cath.
.
Patient cath revealed 2-vessel disease. No interventions at that
time. CT [**Doctor First Name **] made aware and will decide whether patient is a
surgical candidate. Transferred to the floor on a nitro drip and
still with intermittent chest pressure. Pt was continuing to
have ongoing chest pain, initially [**2109-12-14**] that increased to [**6-21**]
despite treatment with imdur and IV morphine. He was also given
IV lopressor and started on heparin gtt. It was unclear if the
pt was going to have a CABG in the future as his PCP wanted him
to be evaluated by Csurg first.
.
Prior to arrival to the CCU, pt was chest-pain free. However,
within ~ 15min of being on the floor, pt became acutely
diaphoretic w/ chest pain [**6-21**] and hypotensive with SBP 56-60s.
His nitro gtt was shut off, he was put in trendelenberg and
given a liter of fluid, run wide open. His BPs responded
immediately. His oxygen saturation went to its lowest at 91% on
room air, increased to 95%, but then was put on a NRB, and had
100% saturations. BS checked at 119. EKG was unchanged from
prior. After a few minutes, SBP increased to 120s, pt regained
color in his face and his chest pain was much relieved. Unclear
as to the etiology of the acute hypotensive episode, but perhaps
likely [**1-14**] nitro gtt.

Studies:

Cardiac Cath [**2111-9-30**] - 1. Selective coronary angiography in
this right dominant system demonstrates two vessel disease.
There is an 80% lesion at the ostium of the left anterior
descending, and an 80% lesion in the right coronary artery
involving the bifurcation of the posterior descending artery.
The left main and circumflex contain mild disease only.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrate normal systemic
blood
pressure.

ECHO [**2111-9-30**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic and mitral
regurgitation.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY [**2111-10-1**] - The lungs
feature bilateral dependent atelectasis with possible
emphysematous changes, although extensive motion artifact limits
evaluation. There are no
concerning lung nodules or diffuse opacities identified. There
is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The airways are patent to
the segmental level bilaterally. There is a left periaortic
mediastinal lymph node which does not meet CT size criteria for
enlargement. No axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy
identified. There is minimal fusiform dilation of the ascending
aorta, with a maximal diameter of 4.44 cm x 3.69 cm occurring
just proximal to the origin of the innominate artery (Series
[**Numeric Identifier 34310**]:Image 7682). This is stable from the prior studies. There
is no dissection flap identified. Scattered atherosclerotic
calcifications are seen in the aorta with more extensive disease
of the imaged coronary arteries. The main thoracic branches of
the aorta are patent with incidental note of a tortuous
innominate artery that has a 180 degree hairpin turn (401b:24).
There is no pulmonary embolism. The imaged upper abdomen is
unremarkable. There are degenerative changes of the thoracic
spine but otherwise the imaged axial skeleton is unremarkable.

Cardiac cath [**10-2**]: final report is pending. A DES was placed in
the 80% RCA lesion.
