Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
acute epidural abscess, MSSA bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Total laminectomy of L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5.
2. Incision and drainage.
3. Debridement.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old male with medical history
significant for gout involving the left ankle for 8 years,
atrial fibrillation on warfarin, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia,
and gout, who presented in atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response on [**2143-1-18**], and was later found to have
MSSA bacteremia. During the admission, he required Medical ICU
monitoring for neurochecks and further evaluation of epidural
abscess.

Pt initially presented to his PCP with an erythematous, painful
left ankle, with concern for gout flare. When seen by his PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was SOB and found to be in afib with rapid ventricular
response. He was transferred to the [**Hospital3 2568**] ED, where the
patient was evaluated by orthopedics who felt that the patient
had a painful left ankle with somewhat preserved passive range
of motion, and that his exam could be consistent with cellulitis
of the lateral aspect of the ankle. Initial labs showed INR of
7.4, Lactic acid of 1, WBC 18, BUN and creatinine of 44 and 0.8,
AST and ALT of 108 and 127, respectively, Alkaline Phos 297, and
C-reactive of 348. He was started on Ampicillin/sulbactam for
antimicrobial coverage for possible cellulitis overlying gout.
However, on the night of [**1-18**], he spiked to 102.3 and prelim
cultures grew GPC's and Vancomycin was added. He had x-rays of
the left ankle that showed no acute fracture, and LENI was
negative for DVT. CTA was done at that time which showed no PE,
but showed pulmonary nodules.

Subsequently, blood cultures in [**12-29**] bottles grew out MSSA
bacteria, and she was switched to oxacillin 2g IV q4hrs. TTE was
done, which was poor quality, but showed no vegetations. For his
Afib, he was treated with IV diltiazem, and subsequently
switched to IV and then po dilt.  Imaging done at that time was
concerning for an epidural collection and possibly abcess in the
L2 , L3 and L4 level. The provisional report was reported by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4892**], radiologist at [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient was evaluated by the
Neurosurgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 3704**], who recommended that the
patient be transfered the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] as the patient
requires more MRI of the Spine (Thoracic and Cervical) and a MRI
brain to rule out any more extensive pathology.

On arrival to the MICU,  the patient was somnolent but
arousable. He has diffuse wheezing bilaterally. He endorses back
pain and neck pain. His vital signs are HR 111 BP 103/72 O2 96%
2L.

The patient was subsequently stabilized in the medical ICU and
later transferred to the hospital medicine service.

IMAGING:
[**Hospital3 **] RECORDS:
X-ray spine [**2143-1-19**]:
Findings:
     Lumbar vertebral heights are preserved.  Normal lumbar
vertebral alignment is maintained.  Minimal decrease in
intervertebral disc spaces noted, predominantly at the L1-L9,
[**12-28**] levels with anterior osteophytosis.  Posterior elements
and soft tissues appear unremarkable.
     Impression:
Lumbar spondylosis.

Ankle x-ray [**2143-1-18**]:
Impression:  Overlying cast obscures bony details.  Sclerotic
line of the medial malleolus may represent a nondisplaced
fracture if there is a history of trauma.  Slight widening of
the medial tibial talar joint space.  Soft tissue swelling.
