Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, hypercapnic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75 yo F with history of diastolic CHF, sleep apnea, CAD, DM,
CRI, 12 hospitalizations over past year, presented w/ dyspnea
and decreased mental status. Had just been discharged on [**4-21**]
after aggressive diuresis for acute on chronic diastolic CHF
during last admission and also tx for UTI.
.
Daughter called EMS this AM for progressive dyspnea and
difficulty ambulating. On arrival EMS found the patient to be
somnolent. FS 66. Per daughter, the patient had been at her
recent baseline the night before, however with some weight gain
and progressive dyspnea in last couple days. Patient on ativan
and percocet at home, per daughter, the patient not known to
have taken increased doses.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: P 73 BP 205/60 100% O2 sat on 3L NC.
Her ABG on arrival to the ED was 7.28/64/78. Her respiratory
rate peristed at 7-9. They pushed narcan 0.4mg x2 prior to
possible intubation with significant response. Pt then became
somnolent again. She was then started on a narcan gtt. Her BP
improved in the ED to 168/58 without any intervention. Labs in
the ED were notable for worsening renal function with creatinine
of 3.4 up from 2.9 on [**4-21**], WBC 12. Serum/urine tox postive for
benzos and tylenol. Her proBNP was mildly elevated at 1730. CXR
was unchanged from prior. EKG stable. The pt was repeated
falling asleep while being examined in the ED.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was arousable to voice,
delirious, not oriented, moving all extremities.

Head CT [**2142-4-25**]:
FINDINGS: Overall, evaluation is somewhat limited by motion,
even after
multiple attempts at acquisition, especially at the skull base.
Allowing for this, there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major
vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter differentiation
is preserved. Ventricular and sulcal size appears
age-appropriate. Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the
cavernous carotids and intracranial vertebral arteries
bilaterally. The surrounding osseous structures are
unremarkable. Many ethmoid air cells are opacified bilaterally
with small amounts of mucosal thickening noted in the maxillary
sinuses bilaterally. The mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**2142-4-25**]:
SINGLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lung volumes are low. The lungs
are clear,
with no consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Slight hazy
opacity at the left base likely reflects soft tissue shadow and
epicardial fat. Heart size is top normal, unchanged from prior
study, with no evidence for pulmonary vascular congestion.
Pleural surfaces are smooth. Visualized bony thorax and
surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged mild cardiomegaly with no evidence for
volume overload. There is no consolidation to suggest pneumonia.


[**2142-4-26**]: TTE - pending at time of transfer to the floor

Brief Hospital Course:
75F with diastolic CHF, sleep apnea, CAD, DM, CRI, RA with
multiple recent hospitalizations over past year who presented to
the ED with respiratory failure, ARF, volume overload (wt 246
lbs).  She was felt to suffer from encephalopathy from percocet,
gabapentin and uremia.  She received Narcan and was admitted to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU where she did well with conservative therapy.
She was called out of the Unit to the General Medical Floor.
.
# Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Hypercarbic on ABG and
decreased respiratory rate possibly related to narcotic usage
given pt was sedated but woke up with narcan. This was stopped
later the evening of admission. Pt did not show signs of opioid
withdrawal.  No opioids on tox screen but oxycodone does not
always show up on screen and tylenol level was elevated.
-renally dosing gabapentin.  Patient with inadequate analgesia
on tylenol alone.  Seems to do well with 1-2 Percocet per day.
She (and her daughter) have been counselled that she is not to
take more than prescribed due to possible grave side effects.
-continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN
-continue CPAP at night
-diuresed over her hospitalization with discharge weight 236 lbs
(dry weight 230 in the past)
-no ACE as history of hyperkalemia
-TTE --> preserved systolic function, moderate pulmonary
hypertension
- patient and her daughter report good home medication
compliance, and home situation.
.
# Constipation - Patient's daughter attributes much of the
patient's difficulties to chronic constipation with intermittent
diarrhea associated with loose liquid stools passing around
formed stool, leading to dehydration, pain and worsening renal
function.
--> continue Miralax as this seems to be the best medication for
this patient for prevention of constipation.
--prn dulcolax, senna
.
# Leukocytosis on admission --> resolved.  BCx and UCx
unrevealing
.
# acute on chronic renal insufficiency:
--likely secondary to acute prerenal azotemia
--improved with conservative treatment
--continue to renally dose medications
.
# CAD s/p MI and stent:  Pt CKs trended up and then down.
Troponin peak at 0.04.  MB index was positive. EKG was unchanged
from prior.  Likely elevated in the setting of renal impairment,
doubt acute cardiac ischemia.
No events on telemetry through [**4-28**].  Telemetry d/c'd.
-restarted ASA, statin, beta blockers
.
# anemia: HCT at baseline.
.
# DM2:
--On Lantus and ISS
.
# depression: continued on citalopram.
.
# hypothyroidism: Continued on synthroid.
.
# rheumatoid arthritis/neuropathy/shoulder pain:
-see above for pain control
.
# PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx and a PPI per home regimen.
