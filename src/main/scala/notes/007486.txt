Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
65M h/o esophageal dysmotility, aspiration PNA, G-tube, ?Churg
[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], COPD and MS presented to the ED with CP and SOB x 1
day. Of note, has had 4 admissions in the last 2 months, most
recently [**Date range (1) 107262**] for CP and SOB. His prednisone was
increased and he was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**].
.
On arrival to the ED, vital signs were T 101.9, HR 104, BP
134/59, RR 24, 86% on 10L. Sat remained < 90% on NRB. Pt
endorsed that his Sx were similar to prior flares but worse. He
c/o left-sided CP, but no radiation, nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis. No Hx of cardiac interventions, but pt does states
that he has nitro at home to use PRN chest pain. He was put on
BiPAP in the ED. No subjective improvement, but pt's sat did
improve. Prior to transfer, he was put back on NRB and was
satting 93%. he got 5mg IV morphine x 1 for CP which didn't
help. He then got SL NTg x 1, which relieved his CP. Of note,
first trop <0.01, no ECG changes. Given concern for new
infiltrates on CXR, he was given cefepime/levo/vanc.

Labs showed WBC 10 but 88% PMNs. Hct at baseline, lactate 1.0.
ABG on BiPAP 7.59/29/82/29.

CXR was conferning for increased infiltrate in the right base
compared to prior.

Pt ws given vancomycin, cefepime, and levoflox for HCAP
coverage. Also given solumedrol, 1L NS, and morphine for pain.

.
In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt arrived on NRB mask but was sating close to 100%
and mentating well.  He was switched to nasal cannula.  His
vitals were 119/65, 72, 20, 92% 3L NC

[**2171-6-23**] CXR
FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart size is
difficult to assess.  Multifocal opacities in the lower lungs
appear more confluent than on the prior study, particularly at
the right lung base.  The significance is uncertain since there
has been opacification in the area suggesting chronic scarring.
However, along the lateral right lung base, a new lateral
component was not clearly present on recent prior radiographs
and may represent superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting.

IMPRESSION: Patchy lateral right lower lung opacity for which
the possibility of pneumonia superimposed upon existing
atelectasis could be considered in the appropriate setting.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o M with h/o MS, G-tube for recurrent h/o aspiration PNA,
severe COPD, possible churg-[**Last Name (un) **]/eosinophilic pneumonia and
multiple recent admissions for SOB who presents from [**Hospital 7137**] with SOB and CP requiring BiPAP in the ED.
.
# Hypoxia/Aspiration Pneumonia - Pt was initially admitted to
the ICU due to BIPAP requirement, yet he did not need that by
the time he arrived.  He was placed on nasal cannula initially
at 4L and titrated down.  His symptoms and findings are most
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  He was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics and will continue HCAP coverage to complete
7 days. Pt has remained afebrile and improving clinically with
decreased oxygen requirement.
- PICC was placed to complete 7 days of IV antibiotics with
Zosyn for aspiration/hospital acquired pneumonia
-cont incentive spirometer, oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
and titrate as possible, at baseline uses 2L occasionally
-cont standing nebs, and prednisone for COPD/Churg [**Last Name (LF) 3532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
complete 5 days of prednisone 60mg then back to 10mg
- Bcx remain negative at time of discharge
- aspiration precautions as possible
- Recommend PT for pulmonary toilet
.
# Hypotension: resolved, was asymptomatic, and given 1L NS on
[**2171-6-25**].  He runs at low BPs at baseline.
.
# Back pain: stable on home morphine and fentanyl patch
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 25 mcg qday
.
# OSA:  will have repeat sleep study in [**Month (only) 205**] to reassess
.
# Esophageal dysmotility: Continue Reglan 5 mg QID

# HLD: on pravastatin
.
# Depression: continue celexa 30 mg qday
.
# Bipolar d/o: continue quetiapine 12.5 mg hs prn, trazodone 50
mg
hs prn
.
# Osteopenia: continue home Ca + Vit D
# Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 107263**] (partner, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107261**])

# Code: Pt wants intubation per discussions in ED. However, pt
is known to palliative care and their notes document DNR but OK
to intubate. He was seen by them here and they will continue to
follow whenever he gets admitted

Transitional:
- will need repeat sleep study in future to determine if his OSA
has really resolved
-Recommend PT for pulmonary toilet
