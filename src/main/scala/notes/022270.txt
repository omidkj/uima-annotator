BASIC COAGULATION (PT, PTT, INR)
[**2125-7-26**] 10:14   12.1 23.3   1.0

MRI Head [**7-8**]
Large heterogeneous, hemorrhagic right parietal mass, without
evidence of associated edema. This appearance is compatible with
an embryonal testicular carcinoma metastasis, though the absence
of surrounding edema is unusual. Other diagnostic considerations
in a HIV-positive patient include lymphoma, particularly given
the periventricular location, but the absence of associated
edema is also atypical for lymphoma.

CT head [**7-8**]
Right parietal parenchymal lesion abutting the lateral
ventricle, with
probable surrounding edema (versus cystic components). While
this is
concerning for a mass, infection is also possible, given the
patient's
immunocompromised status. Recommend contrast-enhanced MRI for
further
evaluation.

CT head post op [**7-8**]
1. Large right frontal epidural hematoma and subdural hematoma
with concern for active bleeding. Transtentorial as well as
subfalcine herniation with shift of normally midline structures
measuring approximately 1.7 cm. Edema within the right frontal
and parietal lobe is also noted.
2. Post-surgical changes including pneumocephalus and right
parietal
craniotomy.

CT head post epidural evacuation
1. Decreased pneumocephalus
2. Decreased shift from midline - now 5mm, previously 9mm,
3. Stable effacement of temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle

4. No new hemorrhage

[**7-9**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: 1. Post-surgical changes consistent with hematoma
evacuation, including partial craniectomy and extensive
pneumocephalus. Interval decrease in midline shift towards the
left, now measuring 9 mm.
2. Interval development of focal intraparenchymal small
hemorrhages in the
right frontal, parietal, and right cerebral convexity. Close
interval
followups CT scanning is recommended.

[**7-10**] Head CT:IMPRESSION: 1. Slight increase in right frontal
pneumocephalus. 2. Persistent leftward shift of normally midline
structures of approximately 6 mm.
3. Focal parenchymal hemorrhages in the right frontal and
parietal lobes,
overall similar in appearance, with no significant new
hemorrhage.

[**7-12**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Hypodense areas in the right
frontal and parietal lobes are more conspicuous than on prior
study and more extensive in location than the prior mass.
Another hypodense area on the anterior right frontal lobe is
more defined. This may represent edema, ischemia, infarct or
tumor infiltration.  Recommend MRI and follwo up(if not
contra-indicated) for better assessment of these hypodense
areas.
2. Decreased pneumocephalus.
3. Stable leftward shift from normally midline structures

[**7-13**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Since the previous CT of [**2125-3-1**]
both the intracranial pressure monitoring device has been
removed. There is craniectomy with multiple hypodensities in the
right cerebral hemisphere unchanged from previous study with
foci of hemorrhage and pneumocephalus. No new hemorrhage is
seen.

[**7-14**] Head MRI: IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive predominantly cortical
infarcts are seen in the frontoparietal and occipital lobes.
Given somewhat atypical vascular distribution, the infarcts
could be venous rather than arterial in origin. Petechial
hemorrhages are identified within the infarcts. 2. Status post
craniotomy in the occipital region with resection of the
previously seen enhancing mass. Subtle enhancement remains in
this region which could be postoperative in nature. 3.
Craniectomy identified as seen on the previous CT.

[**7-18**] Head CT:
1. Collection in right anterolateral aspect of the anterior
cranial fossa is now fluid-filled with minimal residual
pneumocephalus.
2. Overall, no significant change from [**2125-7-13**] study.

[**7-21**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall stable appearance of the brain status post right
parietal mass
resection and epidural and subdural hematoma evacuation with
stable 4-mm left shift, without new focus of hemorrhage. Small
anterior surgical bed
collection with a trace pneumocephalus is unchanged.
2. Paranasal sinus disease.

Chest XR [**7-24**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the
tip of the PICC line lies in the mid-to-lower portion of the
SVC. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
This information was discussed by the resident on call with the
IV access obtained.

Head CT [**7-26**]:
8mm increase in extra-axial fluid collection. No other
intracranial changes or findings


Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-8**] Pt is a 33m with previous history of testicular cancer s/p
orchiectomy and chemotherapy. He was intially diagnosed with
this in [**2114**] and had his procedure at that time. Pt has
complained of 2 weeks of headaches that have become
progressively worse over the last 3 days. CT of the head upon
admission showed a right parietal mass with surronding vasogenic
edema. There was minimal
