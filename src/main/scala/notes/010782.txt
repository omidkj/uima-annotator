[**2132-10-8**] Interventional Radiology : Coil and Gelfoam
embolization of two tertiary splenic branches which supplied AV
fistula and apparent intraparenchymal pseudoaneurysms as well as
Gelfoam embolization of the third branch supplying irregular
contrast collection in the subcapsular region of the spleen. A
large inferior splenic branch remains patent supplying
approximately 30% of remaining perfused splenic tissue


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1358**] was admitted to the TSICU for close monitoring,
serial hematocrits and blood pressure monitoring. His pain was
well controlled with a Morphine PCA. His hematocrit on admission
was 37 and after serial checks dropped to 33 and stabilized
there.

On [**2132-9-19**] he underwent arteriography and embolization of the
2nd and 3rd branches of the splenic artery.  He tolerated the
procedure well, continued to have his hematocrits followed and
they remained stable.

He was subsequently transferred to the Trauma floor for further
management where he continued to make good progress.  He
abdominal pain was minimal and generally relievewith Tylenol. He
was up and ambulating with the use of a cane.  The Physical
Therapy service recommended home physical therapy and
supervision at home over the first 24 hours.  His grandaughter
who is a nurse will be staying with him.

His blood pressure during his hospitalization was generally
lower in the 90-100/60 range. Therefore his pre admission
medications were adjusted and will have to be followed by his
PCP as he may require the full dose in time.

Pior to discharge he had a Pneumovax vaccine as well as
influenza. After an uneventful recovery he was discharged home
with VNA services for cardiovascular assessment and home
physical therapy.
