History of Present Illness:
Adapted form Dr.[**Name (NI) 32659**] note [**6-13**]:
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 66958**] is a 79 year old man with known severe AS, CHF, HTN,
Hyperlipidemia, pulmonary hypertension, CAD s/p CABG, carotid
stenosis, AFib, DM, CKD, COPD on home O2 who was being
transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] for evaluation for aortic stenosis
treatment options.  He has been on home oxygen therapy since a
CHF exaccerbation approximately one year ago.
.
Five months ago he underwent an emergent appendectomy secondary
to rupture ([**2140-1-31**]) followed by prolonged hospitalization
complicated by CHF and volume overload. Since then, he has had 7
readmissions for shortness of breath, CHF, ileus, and pneumonia.

.
On [**2140-4-10**] he was admitted to [**Hospital3 4107**] with CHF
exacerbation. He also complained of intermittent chest pressure
at rest and with exertion. He was diuresed and by report lost 10
pounds. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 2025**] for evaluation of AVR. At [**Hospital1 2025**],
he was noted to have severe aortic stenosis with a valve
area of 0.7cm2, peak gradient of 71mmHg, and mean gradient of
42mmhg, also LVH and LVEF 70% and pulmonary artery hypertension
at 63mmHg. He was evaluated for percutaneous aortic valve
repair, it was noted that his aortic valve area is 25mm which is
too large to accomodate the valves used by the PARTNERS [**Name (NI) **].
[**Name2 (NI) **] was evaluated by [**Hospital1 2025**] for surgical aortic valve replacement
and the mortality calculated was 14%, making him a candidate for
percutaneous aortic valve replacement.
.
According to the discharge summary, he also had a CT angiogram
which showed that his iliac arteries are too narrow to allow a
trans femoral approach using the [**Doctor Last Name **] device (6 mm). He
underwent cardiac cath which showed severe three vessel disease
with patent LIMA to LAD and SVG to Circumflex grafts but
severely diseased SVG to RCA that was not ameniable to
percutaneous intervention.
.
As part of his workup at [**Hospital1 2025**], he underwent carotid ultrasound
which showed patent [**Doctor First Name 3098**] s/p endarterectomy but the [**Country **] was
severely narrowed, he underwent carotid angiogram which
confirmed 80% stenosis of the [**Country **]. Vascular surgery was
consulted who recommended deferring endartectomy until after
aortic valve repair.
.
He complained of minimal shortness of breath at rest and is able
to ambulate around home slowly with mod DOE. He has not used his
O2 in about 1 month since furosemide dose increased and swelling
improved.  He is NYHA Class II.
.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denied
exertional buttock or calf pain. He had very itchy and burning
LE bilat that was keeping him awake at night. Also c/o "[**Last Name (un) 62001**]
horse" cramping in his right neck area, but has not taken any
pain medicine for this. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
