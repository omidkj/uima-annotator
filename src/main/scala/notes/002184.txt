HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 78-year-old female with
history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and history of
stroke was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU in
cardiogenic shock.  At home, the patient was found to be
unresponsive with vomitus on her pillow.  She was brought to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, where she was found to be in atrial
fibrillation at 150 beats per minute.  Initially she was
normotensive, but became hypotensive with systolic blood
pressures to the 60s.  At that time, she was successfully d-c
cardioverted into sinus rhythm in the 80s.  She remained
hypotensive and was therefore intubated for airway protection
and started on dopamine.

In addition, she was placed on Neo-Synephrine drip,
dobutamine drip, and nesiritide drip.  Prior admission to
[**Hospital1 18**], she was on dobutamine 2.5 mcg/kg/minute and 30
mcg/minute of Neo-Synephrine.  On those medications, her CVP
was 10, pulmonary artery pressure of 46/15, wedge of 14, and
cardiac output 3.5, and cardiac index 2.0, and SVR of 2514.

She had a myocardial infarction with troponin I 13.8 and a peak
CPK of 822.  She had an echocardiogram that was preliminary
read as an EF of 30%, apical hypokinesis, mild MR, TR, and
PR.  Prior to her transfer, she had a temperature max of
101.6, and was started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  Her platelets were
noted to decrease from admission from 148 to 90 prior to
discharge while on Lovenox.  This occurred over a two-day
period.

Patient arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] intubated, unalert, with heart rate
irregular with a wide complex on telemetry, MAP of 50s-60s on
Neo-Synephrine and dobutamine.  She was started on an
amiodarone, given 5 mg of Lopressor, and a heart rate
decreased to the 80s.
