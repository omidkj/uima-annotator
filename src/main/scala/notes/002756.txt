History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10523**] is a 74 y/o M with a h/o IPF, bullous emphysema
normally on home oxygen for exercise and a recent
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 10525**] for pneumonia, where he
was discharged on levofloxacin, cefpodoxime and flagyl and at
the time of discharge had an increased oxygen requirement to 1L
at rest and 3L with activity who presents from his
pulmonologists office with continued fever and hypoxia.  He went
to his regularly scheduled pulmonology follow up appointment
today, where he was found to be hypoxic to 75% on 4LNC after
walking in from the car.  After resting his oxygen saturation
improved to the high 80's, however when he walked around the
room he continued to desaturate to the 80's on 3-4LNC.  A CXR
was done that showed the known RUL PNA, and he continued to
complain that he felt "hot" at night, so he was sent to the ER
for further evaluation as his physician was concerned that he
could have an infected bullous.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 99.4, 84, 138/74, 20, 89% 4L.  In
the ER since he was desaturating with ambulation, a CTA of his
chest was done that showed multiple small pulmonary emboli,
worsening of the RUL pneumonia and fluid in the fluid in the
right upper lobe in bullae of unclear etiology.  He was given
vancomycin and zosyn (has a pcn allergy, although reportedly
tolerated ok), and started on a heparin gtt.  His labs were
notable for a white count of 13.3 with 78%N, no bands.  During
his ER course he continued to desaturate on 4LNC, and eventually
required a NRB to keep his oxygen saturation in the 93-96%
range, although he did not have any increased work of breathing
or any signs of respiratory distress.  VS on transfer were: 81,
131/70, 20, 93-96% on NRB.
.
On arrival to the MICU his initial VS were: 97.8, 80, 149/68,
16, 97% on 5LNC and 100% shovel mask.  He says that he has not
been coughing much, but every morning says that he does cough to
"clear his airways."  He currently feels well, denies any chest
pain, shortness of breath, n/v/d, abdominal pain, orthopnea or
LE edema.

IMAGING
CTA [**2137-8-8**]:
1. Multiple small pulmonary emboli involving the segmental and
subsegmental
arteries of the right lower lobe and lobar arteries of the left
lower lobe and
lingula. No evidence of right heart strain on this study.

2. Worsening pneumonia in the right upper lobe on a background
of severe
emphysema and known IPF. Fluid within bullae in the right upper
lobe is
thought most likely to reflect normal sequela from pneumonia,
but a
necrotizing component cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10523**] is a 74-year-old man with a history of IPF, bullous
emphysema and recent admission for presumed CAP, discharged on a
regimen of cefpodoxime, levofloxacin and metronidazole who now
re-presents with worsening RUL pneumonia complicated by possible
infected bulla and multiple small pulmonary emboli in the
setting of significantly worsened hypoxemia.
.
#) Pneumonia and possible infected bullae: The patient was
recently hospitalized for a presumed CAP but failed treatment
and re-presented with worsening hypoxia, continued fever and CT
findings of possible infected bullae vs. necrotizing pneumonia.
He was admitted to the MICU for close monitoring. For the HCAP
and infected bullous/functional lung abscess he needed coverage
for MRSA, pseudomonas and bacteroides and was placed on
Vancomycin, Meropenem, and levofloxacin. Multiple induced sputum
cultures were sent however all were contaminated with saliva.
Patients oxygen saturations were noted to improve, he remained
afebrile with a down trending WBC; therefore, he was transferred
to the floor. On the floor he was maintained on supplemental
oxygen as needed to keep oxygen saturations above 92%. Given his
umimpressive history o
