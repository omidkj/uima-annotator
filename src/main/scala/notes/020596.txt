Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
61 yo male transferred from [**Hospital1 6687**] with chest pain and
concern for STEMI, found to have depressed EF but no
intervenable acute coronary dz, transferred to CCU from cath lab
with hypotension.
   Per report, pt had normal day on [**7-18**], lifted weights in AM
hours - felt fine but admitted to sweating 'much more than
usual.'  After lifiting, had 10 minutes of chest discomfort, not
assoc with breathing, then went away.  Had stable day, no acute
issues, lied on beach and ate 'pounds' of licorice, then went
out with friends, drank 2 bottled Heinekens, went to bed.  Awoke
semi-acutely in AM on day of presentation with shortness of
breath.
   At [**Hospital1 18**], EKG notable for mild st-elevations in I, II, ?STEMI
vs. pericarditis, pt clinically SOB, taken to cath lab.  Cath
showed no acute coronary stenoses, bedside echo showed global
hypokinesis, apex>base, rvedp 12, pcwp 22, CI 1.6.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.  Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.

PMH:
1.  obsessive compulsive disorder
2.  cocaine abuse history (heavy 97-99, intermittemntly
currently)
3.  glaucoma

1.  Klonopin prn

ALLERGIES: seasonal allergies

Social History:
Significant for the absence of current tobacco use.  +EtOH hx of
'[**3-28**]' drinks per week, mostly beer, with red wine. Pt married,
has three high school/college aged children.  Pt former
emergency room physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 760**], 'retired' a >5 yrs ago,
moved with family to [**Hospital1 6687**].  Now currently works
construction intermittently, sometimes moonlights in ER.
Reports cocaine abuse issue in 97-99, then has used
intermittently.  On initial history today, reported cocaine use
10-14 days ago, ~'1 gram.'   Then on repeat questioning,
reported significant use the day prior to admission.  Pt also
sexually active with multiple female partners over past 2 years,
last tested >1yr ago, was (-).  Has never had STD.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. Father died at age 59 with "hypertensive
cardiomyopathy," reportedly had 'clean cath a month before'
passing.  Mother has no hx of coronary disease, alive, with
dementia.

Pertinent Results:
EKG on admission notable for mild st-elevations in I, II with
concern for STEMI vs. pericarditis.  A subsequent EKG showed ST
segment elevations in leads I, aVL and V5-V6 which were
consistent with acute lateral myocardial ischemic process. An
EKG with right-sided chest leads demonstrated no evidence of
right ventricular transmural ischemia. The final EKG done on
[**7-19**] showed persistent ST segment elevation in leads I and aVL.
The ST segment elevation previously recorded in leads V5-V6 had
resolved. EKG on [**7-20**] demonstrated prominent T wave inversions
in leads V4-V6 with
biphasic T waves in leads V2-V3 and T wave inversions in the
inferior leads
suggestive of anterior and inferior ischemia. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2142-7-19**] the anterior T wave abnormalities
are new.
.
ETT performed on [**2142-7-19**] demonstrated - The left atrium is
normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Echo on [**2142-7-21**]- Compared with the prior study of [**2142-7-19**]
showed left and right ventricular systolic function are markedly
improved. The left atrium is mildly elongated. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with very mild
hypokinesis of the distal septum and anterior walls. The
remaining segments contract normally and overall systolic
function is preserved (LVEF = 55-60 %). The estimated CI is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**7-19**] demonstrated:
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
nonobstructive coronary artery disease.  The LMCA and LCx were
without
angiographically evident flow limiting stenosis.  The LAD had a
40%
lesion after D1.  The RCA had a 30% mid vessel lesion.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and mean PCWP 22 Hg.  PASP was
elevated
at 42 mm Hg.  Systemic arterial pressure was low at 70-80 mm Hg
with MAP
46 mm Hg.  Cardiac index was depressed at 1.64 mm Hg.
.
HEMODYNAMICS:  elevated pcwp 20, CI 1.6
.
LABORATORY DATA:
CXR [**7-20**]: FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper
limits of normal. No convincing evidence of vascular congestion.
However,
there is some increasing prominence of the azygos vein region,
raising the
possibility of some right-sided heart failure.
