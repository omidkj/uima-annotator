History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old male with history of coronary disease s/p
CABG with a patent LIMA-LAD per cath [**2171**] on plavix, peripheral
[**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease s/p popliteal to posterior tibial graft on
right lower extremity, atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
presenting with new onset of bright red blood per rectum.  Mr
[**Known lastname 25280**] developed acute onset of bright red blood this AM prior
to making it to the bathroom - he had no abdominal pain or
cramping, but daughter reported that he felt weak and looked
pale.  He passed about 200 ccs of blood in the toilet. EMS
arrived on the scene and apparently had a difficult pressure to
appreciate; however consequently BP was noted in the 160s. He's
never had hematochezia before.  Does take plavix and coumadin;
INR was 3.9.  Usually INRs are within range of [**2-10**].  No recent
history of motrin, aspirin, ibuprofen.  Had colonoscopy in [**2174**]
which showed just external hemorrhoids with no other lesions.
Transferred to MICU for further workup.  GI evaluated and plan
on scoping in AM (endoscopy and colonoscopy).

EGD:
Excavated Lesions Five cratered non-bleeding ulcers, with clean
white base, ranging in size from 5 mm to 10 mm were found in the
duodenal bulb. No fresh or old blood was noted.
Impression: Ulcers in the duodenal bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Check H. pylori serology and eradicate if
positive.
F/U with inpatient GI team.

COLONOSCOPY:
Protruding Lesions: Small internal & external hemorrhoids were
noted.
Excavated Lesions: A few diverticula were seen in the whole
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
Other Semi-solid and liquid stool was noted scattered in the
whole colon. This was copiously irrigated and the patient was
re-positioned to improve mucosal visualization. Despite these
measures, small size pathology may have been missed.
Normal terminal ileum
No fresh or old blood was noted.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the whole colon
Bowel prep was fair.
Normal terminal ileum
No fresh or old blood was noted.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: F/U with inpatient GI team.

Brief Hospital Course:
Initial Presentation: 80 yo M with hx of CAD, PVD, HTN, HLD on
plavix and coumadin who presented with GI bleed found to have
drop in HCT and elevated INR.
.
# GI Bleed: Patient presented to the ED after found to have 1
episode of blood mixed with stool. In the ED he had stable vital
signs but was found to have a Hgb/HCT of [**9-2**] (down from 12/35
in [**9-19**], however was previously anemic with HCTs between 25-30),
and an elevated INR of 3.6. Patient was given 2 units of FFP and
subsequently developed hives. He was then given benadryl and
hives resolved. He was evaluated by GI with plans to do
EGD/colonoscopy the following morning. His ASA, plavix, and
coumadin were held. Patient was monitored overnight in the MICU.
He was given IVF but no additional blood products. HCT remained
stable around 24-25. He subsequently underwent an
EGD/colonoscopy and was transferred to the medicine floor.
Endoscopy was significant for duodenal ulcers, diverticulosis,
and small internal and external hemorrhoids. He was transfused
with 2 units of PRBC given demand ischemia (see below) and
responded appropriately. ASA, plavix, and warfarin were
restarted. H. pylori serology was ordered and patient was
started on omeprazole 40 mg po BID. Patient had no further
episodes of hematochezia or melana and HCT remained stable
through remainder of admission. He was discharged with plans to
follow up with his PCP and with gastroenterology.  After
discharge h.pylori serology were +, patient will need to be
treated by PCP as an outpatient.
