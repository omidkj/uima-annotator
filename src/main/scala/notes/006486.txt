History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] M with CAD s/p 4V-CABG [**2135**] and CRI had been doing well until
this AM when he was out walking with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] abruptly
syncopized and a bystander started CPR quickly.  The local fire
department delivered two shocks without success.  Then EMS came
and gave two more shocks and he went back into sinus.  It is
unclear whether he regained consciousness.  He was intubated but
the ET tube went into the esophagus.  It was repositioned to the
trachea, then brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, his intial SBP was reported to be 110.  Labs show K
2.7 and Hct 25.  He was given 40mEq of KCL.  On repeat labs, his
K normalized and his Hct was 33 without any blood.  It is
unclear whether one of the labs was erroneous.  NG lavage was
repeatedly grossly positive.  GI did not want to do EGD until
his hemodynamics were more stable.  With fluids, his BP
normalized and the vitals were recorded as: T=34.8, HR 62,
132/74, 18, 100% on AC 18x500, FiO2 100%.  He was briefly cooled
by Artic Sun protocol but given his GIB, this was stopped.
.
Now the patient is still intubated and hemoadynamically stable
and transferred to the CCU.  GI is currently doing EGD.
.
ROS: Per his wife, sons and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was apparently in good
health.  He does not have chest pain or SOB.  He can walk a few
blocks and up the stairs without symptoms.  Wife denies recent
fevers, abd pain, n/v, hematemasis, hematachezia or BRBPR.  No
orthopena, PND or peripheral edema.  No recent syncope or
lightheadedness.  No h/o stroke or bleeding disorder. The
patient denies any chest pain or pressure, new exertional
dyspnea, orthopnea, PND or leg edema, palpitations or syncope,
claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or
transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit
or urinary symptoms. No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias,
myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of systems
negative.

[**2-29**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 45-50 %). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly depressed global left ventricular function.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

[**3-1**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
septal hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-2-29**],
the findings are similar. Mild regional wall motion
abnormalities are present on both

[**2-29**] CXR IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral apical opacities, which are nonspecific but may be
related to
aspiration or infiltrate.

2. Distal tip of the ET tube 9 cm from the carina and may be
advanced up to 6 cm.

3. Distal tip of NG tube at gastroesophageal junction. Recommend
advancement.

4. Multiple left-sided rib


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with CAD s/p 4v-CABG, CHF, CRI admitted s/p vfib arrest with
GIB initially started on arctic sun cooling protocol.
.
# Vfib arrest. Unclear etiology for VFIb arrest since was
apparently well prior to this episode per family. Possibly from
scar since has h/o ischemia and MI in past. Less likely from
acute ischemia/ACS since no focal WMA on ech
