Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
This 71 yo female patient with history of mild COPD and current
tobacco use presented with a cough and hypoxia, and admitted for
COPD exacerbation.  She was observed for 48 hours in the MICU.
She did not require intubation; her vital signs were closely
monitored.  She received albuterol and ipratropium nebs Q2, as
well as advair inhaler. Prednisone 60mg daily for COPD
exacerbation was also started. She received azithromycin 250mg x
4 days. She was advised to stop smoking but refused a nicotine
patch. Her symptoms improved with this treatment. The patient's
symptoms were most likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation in
setting of URI in a patient with current tobacco use and
untreated COPD. She was transferred to the medicine wards in
stable condition.

MEDICINE [**Hospital1 **] COURSE:
On the wards, the patient was slowly weaned off of nebulizer
treatments of albuterol and ipratropium and changed to inhalers.
 Her Advair inhaler was continued. She was continued on
azithromycin to complete a 5 day course, she was also continued
on prednisone 60 mg po x 5 days and discharged on a prednisone
taper.  Her blood pressure remained wnl during admission, and
her home medications were continued.  She was found to have
acute on chronic renal failure, with Cr elevated from her
baseline of 1.5 to 1.8 on admission. As a result of her bump in
creatinine, the patient's home Metformin was discontinued
*******ADD LISINOPRIL IF D/Cd*****.  These will be restarted as
an outpatient only if advised by her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 410**].

On prednisone, the patient was found to have a leukocytosis and
elevated serum glucose levels, as expected.  Her high serum
glucose levels were treated on a regular insulin sliding scale.
Her glyburide, which was temporarily held in the MICU, was
restarted on the medical wards.

The patient was evaluated by PT and deemed stable for discharge
to home with services on [**2160-10-11**]. Her oxygen was found to
desaturate to less than 88% with ambulation and no oxygen on.
As a result, she was sent home with VNA and continuous home
oxygen.  In addition, blood glucose levels were found to be
elevated due to prednisone.  We started 5 units of NPH nightly
on [**2160-10-10**], and the patient was discharged on this medication,
after having teaching by nursing i
