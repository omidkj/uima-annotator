Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 88 y/o male with a history of 3VD (s/p CABG),
CHF, AF on coumadin, OA of hip s/p b/l replacements who presents
with complaints of LE swelling. Patient has noted worsening b/l
lower extremity swelling over the last month, which had
developed notable skin break down with weeping, erythema, and
pain. Patient feels that his weight is up 6lbs from his dry
weight of 185. The patient has not experienced any chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, or cough. He has no history
of PND, orthopnea, and has not experienced any abdominal
discomfort, early satiety, n/v. The patients legs have become
increasingly more painful, such that the patient could not walk.
He tries to walk 100 to 200 yards daily.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.1, HR 56, BP 123/53, 100% on
2L. Due to concern of cellulitis, the patient was given 1g of IV
vanc. He was noted to have a HR that dropped 40, during which he
was asymptomatic. An EKG showed a wideded QRS, loss of P waves,
and irrecular rhythm. He was admitted to the CCU for further
evaluation and monitoring.

Imaging/Studies:
.
ECG [**12-24**] - Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response.
Left axis deviation.
Intraventricular conduction defect. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-2-6**] atrial fibrillation
with
slow ventricular response has appeared and the QRS complexes are
now wider.
Clinical correlation and repeat tracing are suggested.

CXR [**2186-12-24**] -

PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lungs are clear with
minimal left
basilar atelectasis noted. The inspiratory effort is suboptimal,
limiting
evaluation for mild CHF. Cardiomegaly persists in this patient
status post
median sternotomy and CABG. Aorta is noted to be slightly
unfolded and
ectatic. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is identified.
There is left
basilar atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:

Cardiomegaly without overt CHF or pneumonia.
.
LENI [**2186-12-25**] - IMPRESSION: No left lower extremity DVT.
.
ECHO [**2186-12-25**] -

The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Free wall
motion could not be assessed. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No
aortic stenosis is suggested. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structures
