Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheobronchomalacia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-6-22**] Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage,
right thoracotomy, thoracic tracheoplasty with mesh, right main
stem bronchus and bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh,
and left main stem bronchus bronchoplasty with mesh.
[**2129-7-6**] Right thoracentesis 60 cc heme
[**2129-7-9**] Transthoracic ultrasound. Thoracentesis on the right
side. 750 mL of serosanguineous fluid removed.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old gentleman who has had severe
tracheobronchomalacia which has manifest with dyspnea, cough and
recurrent respiratory infections. His dyspnea was markedly
improved with a silicone
Y stent trial. The patient was evaluated by his cardiologist for
preoperative clearance for this arduous procedure and was
thought to be stable from a cardiac standpoint. Mr. [**Known lastname **] is
at high-risk given the nature of
the operation given his underlying significant lung impairment
with a DLCO of around 50% in addition to his cardiac
co-morbidity with questionable MI in [**2126**], [**2107**] and coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2120**]. He also had a history
of BOOP status post a VATS right lung biopsy nearly 4 years ago.
We did discuss that this diffuse parenchymal lung disease can
some times flare and hasten respiratory failure postoperatively.

CXR [**2129-7-16**] Since the prior study, there is no appreciable
change in the appearance of the chest. There are bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left and unchanged. There
are multifocal airspace opacities with bibasilar consolidation.
Heart is enlarged. Status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Total shoulder replacement on the left.

Echocardiogram [**2129-7-5**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2129-7-1**]: Nec CT
1. Multifocal airspace opacities in the lung, compatible with
multifocal pneumonia.
2. Right pleural thickening, with a trace right pleural
effusion.
3. Bow-shaped appearance of the trachea, with narrowing of the
right bronchus intermedius and the left basal trunk. Of note,
this study is not designed to elicit changes of
tracheobronchomalacia.
4. Right-sided subcutaneous emphysema, likely post-surgical.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 59821**] is a 62 yo male with PMH  : of bronchiolitis
obliterans with organizing pneumonia, TBM s/p Y stent
[**7-/2128**]-[**2129**] and repeat Y stent placement [**2129-3-7**] second
to severe dyspnea with the stent out. On [**2129-6-13**] Stent was
removed Id consult pt with recurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection.  On [**2129-6-21**] admitted pre-op for antibiotics.  On
admission found to have an old PICC line in placed.  Line
removed tip sent for culture and a # 20 g placed.  On [**2129-6-22**]
patient to the operating room for a right thoracotomy and
tracheo bronchoplasty.

Cardiac:  Admitted to ICU post op due to patients cardiac
history. R/O negative for MI. Developed atrial fibrillation
which was treated with Lopressor and amiodarone. he converted to
NSR. Cardiology consult for Afib/flutter-recommended
anticoagulation-digoxin and amiodarone.  He was cardioverted but
went back into atrial fibrillation/flutter.  Cardiology
recommends cardioversion in the future when patient can tolerate
anticoagulation.  He was discharged on Warfarin 2 mg with an INR
Goal of 2.0-2.5.

Respiratory: Admitted to ICU with face mask O2 40%  Developed
stridor and increased secretions on [**6-24**] I. P. performed a
bronchoscopy and BAL sent.  [**2129-6-27**] tran
