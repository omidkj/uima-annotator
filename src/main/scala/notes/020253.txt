Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
87 male with history of untreated colon cancer, PAF (not on
anticoagulation), recent hospitalization for hypoxia, weakness
and a UTI who presents with ongoing weakness and diarrhea. He
was noted to be weak at home, and a friend urged him to activate
his lifeline. He states that he has been having lots of
diarrhea, roughly every two hours, since his last discharge. He
has not been having any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, or bleeding.
.
His last hospitalization concluded that his weakness was due to
deconditioning, and his shortness of breath was due to fluid
overload. He was treated with flagyl for two days last
admission, and, and was discharged on Augmentin to complete a
course for a UTI. He had a positive c.dif toxin noted in the
computer last admission, but was not discharged on any
treatment.


Past Medical History:
Colonoscopy [**2184-3-25**]:
>Polyp in the transverse colon (polypectomy) - adenoma
>Polyps in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)- Colonic mucosa with
focal hyperplastic features
>Polypoid, ulcerated mass in the hepatic flexure (biopsy) -
Superficial fragments of colonic mucosa with ulceration, marked
acute inflammation, and highly atypical glands, suspicious for
carcinoma.


Past history:
# Colon mass during colonoscopy for guaiac positive stools in
[**2184**]. Pathology was worrisome for carcinoma. Although the
patient was offered resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he declined
# hematuria/BPH - traumatic foley insertion and manipulation
[**3-16**] lead to urosepsis and subsequent urinary retention
# sick sinus syndrome and bifascicular block s/p pacemaker [**2184**]

# PAF - on amiodarone, not on coumadin d/t concern for
malignancy
# H/O SVT
# Atrial flutter status post ablation [**2-/2186**] - not on
anticoagulation d/t concern for malignancy
# Anemia - on arenesp and iron
# Echo [**2186**]: mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, RA and LA
# BPH s/p TURMP [**2187**]
# b/l edema with skin changes
# hard of hearing
# hx of guiaic positive stools/GI bleeding
# osteoarthritis
# osteoporosis
# subclinical hypothyroid state as per record
# [**Year (4 digits) **] insufficiency
# right pleural effusion - Found on CT on [**2188-2-25**] for increasing
DOE. [**3-6**] and [**3-18**] thoracentesis c/w transudative. Workup during
last admission revealed RV diastolic dysfunction. Concern was
for PE as etiology, but unable to get CTA d/w ARF and V/Q not
helpful. Not anticoagulated due to h/o GIB, pleurodesis not an
option d/t transudative.
# Tibial talar dislocation with comminuted distal tib fib
fracture status post surgery [**2181**]
# hx syncope in [**2181**], unclear etiology

IMAGING

[**7-2**]-liver u/s-Gallbladder distension likely related to
patient's having been NPO for 48 hours, without evidence of
acute cholecystitis. These findings were posted to the ED
dashboard at 10:30 a.m. on [**2188-7-2**]
.
[**7-2**]-CT abdomen-1. New pancolitis with rectal involvement, with
"accordion"-like accentuated haustration, a marked change since
[**2188-3-5**], is highly suggestive of C. difficile colitis; given
the history of previous episode, this likely represents the
chronic "recurrent" form.
2. Infectious pancolitis (due to Campylobacter, CMV, parasitic
or staphylococcal infection) is a less likely consideration.
3. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
4. Congestive heart failure, with multi-chamber cardiac
enlargement and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left.
.

[**7-2**]-CXR-Portable upright chest radiograph is reviewed and
compared to [**2188-6-22**]. Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is
unchanged, with left pacemaker and two intracardiac leads. Right
pleural effusion is little changed, but there is still right
basilar consolidative opacity. Left basilar atelectasis is
unchanged. There is no left pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Little change in CHF, with slightly decreased right
pleural fluid. Unchanged right basilar atelectasis

[**7-5**]-CXR-Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions

[**7-9**]-CT abdomen/CT chest-1. Multisegmental bilateral pulmonary
emboli.
2. Atelectasis and aspiration/pneumonia of the lung bases
bilaterally, with aspirated barium seen within the left lung
base.
3. Fluid overload, with anasarca and moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.
4. Colonic wall thickening, also involving the rectum. Although
some of the wall thickening may be attributable to volume
overload, these findings are again compatible with a pancolitis
such as pseudomembranous colitis, improved from [**2188-7-2**].
5. Area of stricturing and narrowing of the hepatic flexure,
compatible with known colonic malignancy.
6. Perirectal abscess, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 male with history of colon cancer (untreated), atrial
fibrillation, recent UTI, and positive C.dif toxin assay who
presents with diarrhea, hypotension, and dehydration.
.
# Hypotension: On admission he was hypotensive to SBP 80's and
thus admitted to the MICU, this was likely in the setting of
profound dehydration from GI losses and poor PO intake. He was
fluid responsive thus far (a total of 5L of isotonic fluids).
Alternate etiologies, such as distributive or cardiogenic shock
at this point were considered less likely.  He received a total
of 4-5L and his BP improved such that he was transferred to the
medical floor.  His BP remained normal afterwards. Metoprolol
and terazosin were held throughout admission which patient
tolerated well.
.
# Diarrhea/C.dificile colitis. He has had several positive C
Diff toxin assays, and had one course of treatment after an
[**Month (only) 547**] admission. It is not clear that he was treated during his
past admission.  He was C diff toxin positive again and he was
treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin as his diarrhea was
severe and there was concern about the vancomycin working in the
setting of a rapid transit time.  Initially he did not have
abdominal pain, but began having lower abdominal pain and some
rebound tenderness on exam.  A CT abdomen showed improvement in
the colitis and a new perirectal abscess but no other
abnormalities.  At the time of discharge he was tolerating a
regular diet without difficulty and had improvement in his
abdominal pain and diarrhea.  Antibiotic
