CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2124-7-8**] 10:03 AM
CLINICAL HISTORY: COPD acute exacerbation.

CHEST:
There has been no significant change since the prior chest
x-ray. No areas of consolidation are seen. Emphasematous
changes, particularly in the left apex are again noted.

ECG Study Date of [**2124-7-8**]  11:22:58 AM
Sinus tachycardia. Possible right atrial abnormality. Compared
to tracing #1 anteroseptal ST-T wave changes have improved.
Clinical correlation is
suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o F with a history of COPD on home oxygen (3LNC) and
chronic prednisone, who initially presented to the hospital with
dyspnea and two days of chest pain along with a cough productive
of green sputum, diagnosed and treated for COPD exacerbation.

Active Issues:
# COPD exacerbation: She has severe COPD (stage III) on home
oxygen (3LNC) and chronic prednisone, who initially presented to
the hospital with dyspnea and two days of chest pain along with
a cough productive of green sputum. On admission she was
diagnosed with a COPD exacerbation, thought to be due to heat
exposure as this has happened in the past and there was no
evidence of pneumonia on her chest x-ray. She was treated with
prednisone 60mg and q2h nebulizer treatments however her
symptoms progressed over her first two days in the hospital and
she was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory
distress on [**2124-7-8**]. At that time her ABG was 7.33/86/171. In
the MICU she was initially treated on bipap for three hours with
significant improvement in her symptoms, and her pCO2 improved
to the 70's. She was diuresed with 120mg IV lasix with good
effect as she is -1.6L during her MICU stay.

She was continued on her steroids, azithromycin and duonebs. Her
hypoxia improved and she is currently on her home oxygen with
sats in the low to mid 90's. There was discussion about keeping
her in the ICU overnight for bipap titration, however as it was
thought that she likely had a complex sleep apnea, so will need
a full sleep study with titration prior to bipap initiation.

On transfer she is concerned that her lungs still feel tight,
but her work of breathing has signifi
