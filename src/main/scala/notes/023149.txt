CTA abdomen/pelvis:
1. No evidence of active contrast extravasation.
2. Marked atherosclerotic disease involving all major
intrabdominal vessels.
3. No intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
4. Duodenum mostly collapsed.
5. Fibroid uterus.
6. Renal cysts.

EGD:
Impression: Blood in the stomach
Scope traversed 100 cm likely to 4th portion of duodenum. Red
blood note starting at 90 cm with distal bleeding visualized
reflecting a potential distal small bowel source. No AVM or
active bleed visualized in duodenal bulb or 1st, 2nd portion of
the duodenum.  Otherwise normal EGD to 100 cm, likely 4th part
of the duodenum  Recommendations: Red blood noted distal small
bowel likely past 90 cm reflecting a distal small bowel source
of active bleed likely AVM. Recommend repeat discussion
regarding blood transfusion, tagged red cell scan vs CTA and
angio urgently. Continue PPI gtt in the interim




Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old woman with multiple medical problems presents with
dizziness after an episode of syncope and found to have a
significant drop in hematocrit (baseline 44--->25).  She was
hemodynamically stable and admitted to the ICU for monitoring.
During the night she became hypotensive with blood pressures
falling to systolic blood pressures in the 80s. Patient and
family repeatedly declined blood transfusions based on her
religious beliefs. GI team was notified adn urgent EGD was
performed at 1:00 am. Findings noted above identified source of
hemorrhage as distal duodenal but was unable to intervene.
Interventional Radiology team and surgical teams were notified.
CTA was performed in attempt to localize the bleeding vessel for
embolization. The CTA was negative and IR team saw no indication
for IR procedure.  Surgical service evaluated the patient and
found her to be a very poor surgical candidate given her falling
blood pressures and hematocrit.  The family was notified and
reported to her bedside.  The decision was made to change her
code status to DNR/DNI and to change goals of care to comfort
care only.  Patient was managed overnight in the ICU with IV
fluid boluses and a PPI IV drip.  The patient's blood pressure
continued to fall and she was found to be without a pulse at
10:00 am.  She was apneic, pulseless and without detectable
blood pressure or neurologic function.  Time of death 10:15 am.
Family was at bedside and declined post mortem exam.  Primary
care physician was notified.
