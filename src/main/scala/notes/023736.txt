Admission Date:  [**2193-12-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-12-31**]


Service:  NEUROLOGICAL MEDICINE

NOTE:  The following admission history and physical is as
noted by a Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10447**], M.D., PhD.

DIAGNOSIS:
Stroke.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year-old man with
a history of depression and anxiety who was in his usual
health until about 6:00 p.m. on [**2193-12-16**].  He had
dinner with his family as usual and at baseline was walking
with a walker.  At about 5 or 6:00 p.m. his family found him
sitting on the floor.  There was no witnessed fall according
to his son.  [**Name (NI) **] appeared generally weak.  He was walked over
to a chair, and as his family tended to him he became
progressively weaker and started to speak less.  According to
his son his words were understandable, but very sparse.

He was taken to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital Emergency Room
where a CT of the spine was concerning for a C2 fracture and
he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for stabilization.  He was given Solu-Medrol at 30 mg
per kilogram intravenous a 10:30 p.m.  At the [**Hospital1 346**] he was admitted to the Trauma
Service for presumed fall, however, with complete history of
the event there was no head trauma and no loss of
consciousness.  Further examination showed no evidence of C2
fracture.  While awaiting further evaluation Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] had
a rapid heart rate with a supraventricular rhythm and
cardiology was consulted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Per his son;  1.  Prostate cancer some
six years ago treated with hormones.  2.  Depression.  3.
Anxiety.  4.  Fracture and pin of the left hip two years ago.
He walked at baseline with a walker.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Ritalin.  2.  Celexa.  3.  Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 35.6.  Blood pressure 139
to 164/69 to 87.  Heart rate 80s.  General, well developed,
well nourished man in no acute distress.  Head and neck C
collar in place, clear dentures.  Cardiovascular regular rate
and rhythm.  No murmurs or JVD.  Pulmonary clear to
auscultation.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities, frozen left elbow
joint deformities in the fingers.  Neurological, mental
status, ones eyes to loud voice, vocalizes quietly, but
unintelligibly.  Does not follow commands.  Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  Does not respond to visual
threat.  There are dolls eyes.  The jaw is strong.  Face is
even.  There is no gag.  Motor very little spontaneous
movement, no tremor, increased tone in the legs, left elbow
is frozen.  Withdraws all extremities to pain.  Deep tendon
reflexes are nil in the left upper extremity, 2+ in the right
upper extremity, 2+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles.  Toes
are up going bilaterally.  Sensory grimaces and withdraws to
pain in all extremities.

STUDIES:  CT of the head with C spine revealing no fracture
and the parenchyma is grossly intact.  MR imaging reveals a
few small and bilateral diffusion slowing in the frontal,
parietal and occipital areas consistent with infarction.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.9, hematocrit 39,
platelets 282, PT 12.9, INR 1.1, PTT 29.7, sodium 136,
potassium 3.6, chloride 101, bicarb 22, BUN 16, creatinine
0.6, glucose 301, calcium 9.5, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.2,
AST 46, ALT 58, alkaline phosphatase 218.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] was subsequently transferred
from the Trauma Service to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit
after evaluation revealed no evidence of C2 fracture.  Given
Mr. [**Known lastname 46902**] rapid ventricular rate cardiology consultants
suggested the addition of Amiodarone to his regimen.
However, subsequent evaluation of the electrocardiogram
reveals that he had an episode of supraventricular
tachycardia, which converted to normal sinus rhythm with the
addition of Amiodarone.  They recommended continuation of
Amiodarone at this time.

Evaluation for his strokes revealed multiple infarctions as
noted above consistent with a water shed distribution
infarction perhaps in the setting of a rapid ventricular
rate.  Evaluation of his carotid arteries with ultrasound
revealed no evidence of significant disease in the cervical
potions of the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.  MR
of the cervical spine shows no soft tissue disease and no
evidence of fracture.

Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] was stable clinically and was transferred to the
Neurology Floor.  There is clinical course continued to
improve.  He was noted initially to have a right hemiparesis
and a right facial droop.  He remained mute for the first day
or so on the floor, however, he began to improve with more
verbal interaction.  He responded to his name appropriately.
Subsequently he followed simple commands and his aphagia
steadily improved.  By the time of this dictation Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**]
was alert and oriented to person and place.  He answers
simple questions appropriately.  He has a fluent speech.  His
right hemiparesis improved markedly and now he has only
moderate weakness of the right upper extremity with mild
weakness in his right legs.  His swallowing, however, was not
adequate to sustain safe oral intake and therefore a decision
was made to place a percutaneously inserted G tube for
nutrition and medication administration.  He tolerated this
procedure well without complications.  We anticipate as Mr.
[**Known lastname 46901**] continues to improve clinically from a neurologic
perspective he will be able to swallow and therefore it would
not be unreasonable to reevaluate his swallowing in one to
two months time and consider the removal of the PEG tube.

We note that while in house Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] had some evidence of
pneumonia and therefore he was started on a fourteen day
course of Levofloxacin.  He also had cellulitis on his right
arm and therefore was started on the first generation of
cephalosporin initially in the intravenous form and then
changed to po.

At the time of this dictation Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] is clinically
stable and appropriate for transfer to a rehabilitation
facility where emphasis could be placed on his continued
improvement given special emphasis on his strength and gait
stability.  We anticipate that this will continue to improve
as well as his aphagia.  Again his swallowing could be
reassessed in one to two months time and at that time perhaps
the PEG tube could be removed.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Markedly improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day.  2.
Lansoprazole 30 mg po q day.   3.  Amiodarone 400 mg po
t.i.d.  4.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day for eight more days
to complete a fourteen day course.  5.  Keflex 500 mg po q 6
hours for cellulitis for eight more days.

NOTE:  We should mention that Mr. [**Known lastname 46902**] sugar was high
while in house.  A hemoglobin A1C revealed that he had a
level of 13 suggesting underlying diabetes mellitus.  This
should be assessed at some point in the near future and an
oral hypoglycemic considered.

FOLLOW UP:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] will follow up with his primary care
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may also follow up with the clinic at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 541**] or he may follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1399**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1001**] from the
Stroke Service at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1694**].
