Brief Hospital Course:
[**6-4**] Patient was admitted after transfer from [**Hospital3 46817**], and taken emergently to the OR by orthopedics.  Please
refer to catalog of interventions that Mr. [**Known lastname 63895**] received
during this admission.  After surgery, he was admitted to the
TSICU.  Please refer to the medical record for the details of
his extended ICU stay.  Below is an organ system-based synopsis
of Mr. [**Known lastname 63896**] relevant medical issues during this admission.

NEURO: Mr [**Known lastname 63895**] had high pain medication requirements during
this stay, and was slow to awaken after his sedation was
discontinued after tracheostomy.  He is on a regimen of standing
methadone with PO Dilaudid prn for pain.  At the time of DC, he
was able to follow commands & to express himself through sign
language.  He is able to move his arms but movement of his legs
was not seen, likely because of transection of the spinal cord
at the level of T12.  However, he does appear to have retained
sensation in his legs.

CV: He has a high baseline heart rate, which has been controlled
with lopressor.  [**6-5**] Echo showed good retained LV function and
no valvular abnormalities.

RESP: He had bilateral pulmonary contusions on presentation,
which contributed to his ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **].  He had high PEEP
requirements early in his ICU course, which were gradually
weaned.  A chest tube was placed perioperatively around the 1st
operation, and was DC'd without complication.  After the
tracheostomy was performed, he weaned off the ventilator. 4 days
prior to presentation, the tracheostomy tube fell out post
coughing. The patient has tolerated breathing without the
tracheostomy.

FEN: He was sustained on enteral tube feeds via a postpyloric
dobhoff.  Prior to DC, he passed a swallow evaluation and has
been able to maintain nutrition on a PO diet.  He is on prevacid
as well.

HEME: He received multiple transfusions for blood loss anemia,
especially around the time of his 1st surgery, during which he
lost about 11 L of blood.  He has been prophylaxed against
DVT/PE with lovenox & an IVC filter. He has had a persistent
mild leukocytosis (15-18k), the etiology of which has not been
discovered despite triple antibiotic therapy and repeated
workups.

ID: He developed several line infections, with + blood cultures
with staph epidermidis.  After removal of the lines, he promptly
defervesced.  A sputum culture from [**6-25**] revealed pseudomonas
and he was started on levoquin & zosyn.  He then developed
copious diarrhea and was started empirically on flagyl while
stool cultures were sent. See above under heme for brief
discussion of leukocytosis.

ENDO: regular insulin sliding scale to FBS 80-120.

DISPO: full code, father [**Name (NI) **] is HCP (cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63897**], home
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 63898**])
