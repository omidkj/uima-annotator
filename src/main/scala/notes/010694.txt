History of Present Illness:
77YOM h/o DM, AS, dCHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, CKD, stable angina
referred in from [**Hospital **] hospital for CP. He has been having
increasing exertional angina over the last year, however was
hesitant to have a catheter due to concern about receiving
contrast in setting of CKD.  In lieu of this pt had a pMIBI
performed in [**Month (only) **] that showed moderate reversable defect in
distal anterior wall, unchanged from [**2138**].

CP has been worse over the last 2 weeks, and today was so bad
such that he was not able to vacuum his floor. He is to say that
he needs to have intervention. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 2 weeks
ago as well as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] who is his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a summer home in
[**State 531**], where he was today, went to the hospital was found to
have a troponin of 0.062 (normal for their lab <0.034). He was
given aspirin, nitro paste 1 inch, and 80 mg of Lovenox. Guaic
negative there.

On arrival to ED he was chest pain free.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath [**2143-4-14**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left-dominant system
demonstrated severe single vessel CAD. The LMCA was short
without
significant disease. The proxima LAD had a long lesion with 95%
stenosis. This lesion involved the origin of the D1 branch. The
mid-LAD
had 70% stenosis, which also involved a small D2 branch. The
dominant
LCX was a large caliber vessel without significant disease. The
nondominant RCA had 60% proximal stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated
left-sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP 15mmHg. There was no significant
AV
gradient on pullback. There was severe systemic arterial
hypertension
with a measured central aortic pressure of 181/68/96.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel CAD.
2. Recommend CABG for LAD/D1 disease given complex bifurcation
lesion,
DM, and CKD.
3. Will restart heparin gtt without bolus 4-6h post-sheath pull.
No plavix given.

Final Report
INDICATION:  77-year-old male post-CABG.

COMPARISON:  [**2143-4-20**].

CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL:  Again seen are changes of median
sternotomy, mediastinal clips, and coronary artery bypass
grafting.  Lung volumes remain low, with increasing discoid
atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  There is mild central
venous congestion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.


IMPRESSION:  Limited study.  Low lung volumes and small
effusions.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL COURSE:
77YOM h/o DM, AS, dCHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, CKD, stable angina
referred in from [**Hospital **] hospital for worsening NSTEMI, found to
have extensive LAD disease requiring CABG.

# NSTEMI: EKG with antero-lateral TWI (I avl v5-v6) and twd (I
avl v6) and elevation in III.  All of these changes were evident
on prior ekgs (last [**2143-3-6**]).  Pt was treated with heparin and
went for coronary angiogram on HD2 which revealed extensive LAD
disease extending into DM1, which was too extensive for stent.
Pt was continued on heparin drip and did not have any more chest
pain.  A pre-CABG workup was done and he was cleared for CABG.
Surgery occurred on [**2143-4-18**]

# h/o dCHF/AS: mild as on last echo.  Currently euvolemic.  will
continue with home medications.
- lasix, bb, [**Last Name (un) **]
- I/O monitor

# HTN: continue with home medications
- norvasc
- continue with [**Last Name (un) **]

# discordant blood pressures: R>L, would expect opposite if
aortic dissection, has been documented in past. likely
subclavian or distal lesion
- trend

# CKD: [**1-3**] diabetic nephropathy.  baseline cr is 1.8.  currently
at 1.7.

# DM: insulin sliding scale + glargine 20mg

# hypothyroidism: ccontinue with synthroid

SURGICAL COURSE:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2143-4-18**] where
he underwent CABG x 3 (left internal mammary artery graft to
left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal branch of the right coronary artery)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD # 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  He was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were removed (1 atrial lead was cut).
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD #6 the patient was stable but needed assistance with
ambulation, so it was recommended that he go to rehab. The wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**] on POD#6 in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
