Brief Hospital Course:
80yo F with h/o COPD who presented nausea and vomiting likely
due to progression of her known near-obstructing colon mass, for
which surgery was previously in the process to being scheduled.
She was dehydrated at presentation to the emergency department
and was admitted for volume rescusitation and was taken to the
operating room for a right hemicolectomy.  In the operating room
her blood pressure was low and she was admitted to the ICU
post-op.  She was placed on a phenylephrine drip, received
additional volume resuscitation with 4 L crystalloid and 750
cc??????s colloid and her epidural was discontinued.  Post-op EKG was
normal.  By post-operative day 2 her blood pressure was
stabilized but she experienced several oxygen desaturations
leading to increased oxygen requirement.  She was started on
albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, pulmonary toilet, advair and
her CXR suggested volume overload.  She was given several doses
of IV lasix and was subsequently placed on a lasix drip.  Over
the next 3 days several liters of fluid were diuresed off and
her oxygenation improved until she was able to be weaned down to
2 L O2 via nasal canula without subsequent desaturation.  On
post-op day 6 she was transferred out of the ICU to the floor.

In the ICU she ambulated daily and her diet was progressively
advanced from sips to clear liquids and to regulars, which she
tolerated well.  She began having flatus on post-operative day 3
and began having bowel movements soon afterwards.

A urine culture drawn in the ICU grew E.coli and she was treated
on ciprofloxacin.

At discharge her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air, she was
ambulating with some assistance from either nursing or physical
therapy, was tolerating regular diet and her pain was well
controlled.
