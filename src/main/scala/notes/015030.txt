HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old woman who
is status post coronary artery bypass graft times two by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] on [**2174-6-9**], who had been discharged from [**Hospital1 1444**]  to a rehabilitation facility
after a relatively uncomplicated postoperative course.  The
patient had been at rehabilitation until the day of
discharge.  One week prior to admission the patient had noted
pain and erythema of the left saphenous vein harvest site
with some minimal drainage of her sternal wound.  The patient
was started on Keflex and then switched to intravenous
Rocephin at the rehabilitation facility with worsening
erythema.  The patient was taken by her husband to a primary
care physician's office and subsequently sent to [**Hospital1 346**]  at the recommendation of her
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient also reports increasing
shortness of breath and fatigue with a pleural effusion on
chest x-ray and improvement in her symptoms with intravenous
Lasix.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Hypertension.

Arthritis.

Status post hysterectomy.

Status post coronary artery bypass graft times two.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. every day.
2. Lasix 20 mg p.o. every day.
3. Rocephin.
4. Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. twice a day.
5. Conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg p.o. every day.
6. Enteric-coated Aspirin 81 mg p.o. every day.
7. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
8. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. every day.
9. Albuterol nebulizer p.r.n.

The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Service where
she was noted to be afebrile, in sinus rhythm, breath sounds
with bilateral crackles, breath sounds decreased at left lung
base, a sternal incision with mild erythema at distal pole,
no drainage and no fluctuance.  Bilateral lower extremities
with 2 plus pitting edema left lower leg saphenectomy site
with erythema and areas of open incision.  Cultures from the
patient's sternal and saphenous vein sites subsequently grew
out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient
was started on vancomycin on hospital day no. 2.  The patient
was noted to have an INR of 14 on routine lab draws.  The
patient had a stat echocardiogram which showed an ejection
fraction of 25 to 30 percent with no significant pericardial
effusion, severe mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid
regurgitation.  The patient was administered 4 units of fresh
frozen plasma to reverse the INR.  A Hematology consultation
was obtained and it was felt that the supratherapeutic INR
was due to the recent addition of antibiotics and recommended
reversing the INR with FFP and vitamin K as needed.  By
hospital day no. 3, the patient's INR was down to 1.3.  The
patient was noted to be atrial flutter.  An electrophysiology
consultation was obtained to evaluate the patient for the
patient's atrial flutter as well as whether the patient
needed a biventricular ICD.  The patient was made n.p.o. and
was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where she
underwent an atrial flutter ablation.  The patient required
one unit of packed red blood cell transfusion and it was
decided that the patient would be discharged to home and
return for the ICD placement after the patient's leg had
healed.  The patient returned from the lab in sinus rhythm
with occasional premature ventricular contractions.  The
patient's respiratory status gradually improved with the
administration of aggressive diuretic therapy and returned to
sinus rhythm.  Chest x-ray gradually improved to a stable,
small to medium sized left pleural effusion with which the
patient is asymptomatic. On hospital day no. 5, the patient
had a PIC line placed for intravenous vancomycin.  The
patient had been started on heparin for anticoagulation.  The
patient was re-started on Coumadin as the decision had been
made to postpone the placement of the ICD.  The patient's
left leg required bedside debridement multiple times and by
hospital day no. 11, the patient's leg had improved
significantly and she had been cleared for discharge to home
with continued intravenous antibiotics and follow-up with the
Electrophysiology Service as an outpatient.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  TMAX 98.7 degrees, pulse 68, in
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 129/60, respiratory rate 14,
room air oxygen saturation 94 percent.  Neurologically, the
patient is awake, alert, oriented times three.  Nonfocal.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub and with III out
of VI systolic murmur.  Breath sounds are clear bilaterally,
decreased at the left base.  Gastrointestinal:  The abdomen
is soft and nontender, nondistended.  Sternal incision is
clean, dry and intact without erythema or drainage.  Chest x-
ray on [**2174-7-11**] showed a stable mild to moderate sized
left effusion without a pneumothorax or infiltrate.  Left
lower extremity mid calf incision is open approximately 1 cm
wide by 0.5 cm deep with a creamy yellowish eschar at the
base, with approximately 0.5 to 1 cm surrounding erythema.
The incision is mildly tender.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. every day.
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3. Enteric-coated Aspirin 81 mg p.o. every day.
4. Carvedilol 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
5. Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. four times a day.
6. Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
7. Zinc 220 mg p.o. every day.
8. Santyl ointment to left lower extremity twice a day.
9. Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
10.      Multivitamin 1 p.o. every day.
11.Vancomycin 1 gm intravenous twice a day times 10 days via
right antecubital PIC.
1. Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day times 10 days, then 40 mg
   p.o. every day.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. twice a day times 10 days,
   then 20 mEq p.o. every day.
3. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. on [**2174-7-11**] and [**2174-7-12**].  PT INR

   per Dr.[**Name (NI) 56122**] office.

The patient is to be discharged to home in stable condition.
She is to go to the Framington Emergency Room Access Clinic

These dressing changes are to be performed, cleansed with
normal saline and Santyl applied to the wound bed, covered
with dry sterile dressing.  This should be done twice a day.
