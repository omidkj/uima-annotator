Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Pollen/Hayfever

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, nausea/vomiting/decreased G tube intake.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-5-29**]: Thoracentesis with pigtail catheter placement.

[**2105-6-1**]: R lung decortication.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year-old male with a past medical history of
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck of unknown primary
site s/p radiation in [**2100**], emphysema, s/p PEG tube placement
who presented to the ED with worsening nausea/vomiting and
decreased ability to feed himself through the G tube for the
past several days. Per clinic notes, patient has been
experiencing increasing SOB and fatigue over the last several
weeks.  On questioning, he states that his SOB has actually not
acutely worsened, but he feels that his trachael "fibrosis" has
become worse.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 99.6 103 126/65 18 95% RA.  CXR
showed large loculated effusion on the right vs. consolidation.
He recived levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, 2 L of fluid for SBPs
90-95.  On transfer, he was 96% 2.5 L.
.
On the floor, patient is comfortable, sating in the high 90s on
2.5 L, answering questions appropriately.

.
[**2105-5-28**] CXR:
Large right hemithorax opacity which is presumably large at
least
partially loculated effusion with associated atelectasis.
Underlying
pneumonia or mass lesion is difficult to entirely exclude.
Consider CT scan for further evaluation.

[**2105-5-29**] (Pre-Thoracentesis) Chest CT:
1. Large loculated right pleural fluid collection, most likely
empyema, but incompleteley imaged, nodular right pleural
thickening and possible basal lung or pleural mass suggest
alternative diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion.
Thoracentesis should be diagnostic
2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
3. Right upper lobe posterior segment pulmonary nodule, stable
from
[**2104-12-1**] exam.

[**2105-5-29**] Abdominal XR:
A PEG tube projects over the right mid abdomen. Contrast is seen
in the renal calices without dilation. The bowel gas pattern is
nonspecific without evidence of obstruction or ileus. There is
no free air. Opacity at the right lung base is better assessed
on CXR [**2105-5-28**] and CT [**2105-5-29**]. Osseous structures are intact.
No evidence of obstruction or free air.

[**2105-5-29**] (Post-Thoracentesis) Chest Ct:
Large right pleural effusion is decreased in size from [**2105-5-28**] exam.
Pigtail catheter projects over right lower lobe hemithorax.
Right lung base opacity likely represents atelectasis. Left lung
is clear. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart size is
normal. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. Moderate-to-large
right pleural effusion, slightly decreased in size from [**2105-5-28**]
exam.

[**2105-6-5**] Videoswallow:
IMPRESSION: Gross aspiration of both thin and nectar thick
barium

[**2105-6-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION:

Stable mild-to-moderate right hydropneumothorax without
significant change
compared to most recent prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ED on [**2105-5-28**] with nausea and
vomiting, and cough, found to have a large right sided pleural
effusion. He was admitted to the MICU team and started on
levaquin, flagyl and ceftriaxone.  He was covered with
ceftriaxone/levofloxacin for CAP, flagyl for anaerobic coverage
for poor dentition. CT chest was performed on [**2105-5-29**] revealing
a Right locualted effusion and RUL stable lung nodule (from
[**11-28**]).  The loculated effusion was tapped by IP for 160 cc on
[**5-29**] and then put out 90cc from pigtail drain before transfer to
floor and grew GP
