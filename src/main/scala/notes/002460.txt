HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87 year old woman
with a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
urinary tract infection, history of aspiration, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, who is a nursing home patient
with a recent admission for presumed urosepsis roughly one
and one half weeks ago.  The patient was admitted under the
sepsis protocol and treated with Vancomycin once culture data
from her nursing home grew Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in her urine.  The patient defervesced
and was discharged home on Levofloxacin.  Two days after her
discharge, the patient started to develop nausea and vomiting
and abdominal pains.  The patient also noted a productive
cough of white sputum.  At her nursing home, the patient was
found to have desaturated to 82% in room air and was
transferred to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 346**].  On arrival, the patient was
normotensive, in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate
of 150 and temperature of 103.8.  The patient later became
hypotensive, systolic blood pressure in the 70s, requiring
fluid resuscitation.  The patient was given 1.5 liters of
normal saline, one gram of Vancomycin, 500 mg of Levofloxacin
and 500 mg Metronidazole in the Emergency Department.  The
patient was initially started on Levophed and Dobutamine
drips for hypotension.  The patient was subsequently
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

infection in [**2105-2-1**].

16. Senna twice a day.
17. Iron Sulfate 325 mg once daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident at [**Hospital3 14109**] Home.  She is DNR/DNI but pressors are OK.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 99.4,
pulse 117, blood pressure 98/45, currently on Levophed,
respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 96% on two liters of
nasal cannula.  Her CVP is 10.  On general examination, she
is in no acute distress, awake, alert and oriented and
responsive.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Mucous membranes are dry.  On lung
examination, she has crackles one third up bilaterally
without any evidence of wheezing.  Heart examination is
irregularly irregular, tachycardic.  Abdominal examination is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities show no pedal
edema and no cyanosis with occasional ecchymosis.  Neurologic
examination - The patient is alert and oriented times three,
grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, urinalysis was negative for
evidence of infection, less than one bacteria, no leukocyte
esterase, negative white blood cells.  White blood cell count
on admission was 16.2, with 17 bands.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrates but bilateral
basilar atelectasis.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation at a rate of roughly 120s.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit under the sepsis protocol.  The patient was given
aggressive fluid resuscitation and required Levophed pressor
for her hypotension.  The Dobutamine drip initially was
weaned off as the patient was tachycardic.

The patient was initially febrile.  The source was unclear
but thought to be partially treated Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection and the
possibility of tracheobronchitis/pneumonia.  The patient was
initially placed on Vancomycin and Imipenem for broad
spectrum coverage given that her blood pressure was low and
appeared to be septic.  The patient was pancultured.  Blood
cultures grew coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus in two
out of four bottles.  Urine culture was negative.  Sputum
cultures were inconclusive.  The patient was later switched
to                      , Tazobactam and Vancomycin
antibiotics for coverage.  The patient had defervesced soon
after antibiotic administration.  Echocardiogram was
performed to visualize evidence of vegetation and signs of
endocarditis.  The transthoracic echocardiogram did not show
evidence of vegetations.

The patient was tachycardic during hospital course with heart
rates into the 120s with evidence of heart failure.  Based on
prior echocardiograms, the patient had diastolic heart
dysfunction.  Controlling the rate was difficult as the
patient was hypotensive.  She was started on Digoxin.  She
was loaded and given daily doses of Digoxin with better rate
control.  The patient was also diuresed slightly with Lasix
given that she had mild oxygen requirement and evidence of
pulmonary edema.  For the patient's atrial fibrillation, she
was continued on Coumadin and her coagulation was monitored
daily.

Once tachycardia was improved, blood pressure became normal
and the patient was weaned off Levophed pressor.  The patient
maintained good urine output and mentation during her
hospital course.

At the time of dictation, the patient was being transferred
to a medical floor.  Please see discharge addendum for
further details of hospital course.
