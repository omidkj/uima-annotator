Brief Hospital Course:
** Note - this hospital course summary was completed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the attending Hospiatlist responsible for Ms. [**Known lastname **] care
from the time she left the ICU to the medical [**Hospital1 **] until
discharge (only from the night of [**2159-12-26**] until her discharge on
[**2159-12-28**]).  For details of her care prior to this point refer to
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (for admission until transferred to the ICU) and
then to Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of the Pulmonary Division (for
the details of her hospitalization in the ICU) - the following
represents the summary of the care for the dates that I was her
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 19007**]**

In brief (initial course obtained from [**Location (un) 1131**] the medical chart
for the dates prior to [**12-26**]): 51F with HIV on HAART, HCV,
bipolar disorder, and chronic pain, COPD v. Asthma initially
presented with pyuria and fever, coughing and dyspnea; this was
initially managed as a copd exacerbation with steroids and
antibiotics, and at some point she became progressively more
dyspneic and hypoxic, requiring transfer to the ICU where she
was found to have pulmonary edema, and underwent aggressive
diuresis for 14 litres of fluid.  She stabilized, and surface
echo was completed to evaluate the etiology of her pulm. edema.
Due to her obesity, echo images were of insufficient quality for
evaluation of possible pulm htn, or shunt.   Due to this, and as
pulm hypertension was felt to be likely either due to HIV
disease, copd, or obstructive sleep apnea, cardiology was
consulted in order to evaluate for the need for Rt. heart
catheterization to eval for pulm. htn.  She was then transferred
to me on the medical [**Hospital1 **].  At this time cardiology had not
given formal input re: this question.  Over a period of days,
and in discussion with psychiatry, the patients health care
proxy, the patient, and cardiology I managed to arrange for rt.
heart catheterization on [**2159-12-28**].  However, right before this was
to be done, the pt. refused.  She did not have capacity to make
this decision, however, as it was diagnostic, and non urgent,
and as she would have to comply for the proceedure to be safely
done, it was cancelled.

She was ambulatory, afebrile, and saturating 95% on room air, so
she was discharged home with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
pulmonary arranged; she should have rt. heart cath arranged as
an outpatient if Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (her PCP) agree with the
utility of this examination given her above mentioned episode of
pulm edema and hypoxia of unclear etiology.
