Chief Complaint:
Left groin wound infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incision and drainage of left groin wound.


History of Present Illness:
This 83-year-old lady has had an aortobifemoral
graft in the distant past. She clotted her left limb a few
weeks ago, developed left foot ischemia. On [**2126-6-1**], she
underwent a thrombectomy of the graft and revision with a
Dacron patch profundoplasty. She did well from this procedure
and was in rehab recovering. However, last night was taken to
a local emergency room with bleeding from the left groin. A
left groin cellulitis was seen and the patient was
transferred here urgently for further care. CT scan showed
some fluid around the graft, although was unclear as to
whether or not the infection involved the graft itself and
there was no pseudoaneurysm noted. Admitted for IV ABX and I&D

was normal with normal bolus control and formation. Although
there is a mild delay in swallow initiation palatal elevation,
laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure were within
normal limits. The patient had one episode of penetration with
thin liquid secondary to mild swallow delay. No aspiration was
