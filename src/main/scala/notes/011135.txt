Brief Hospital Course:
61 year-old male with past medical history of cocaine
abuse/narcotic seeking, asthma with FEV1/FVC 54% predicted and
multiple hospitalizations in the past for asthma exacerbations,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, who presents with
asthma exacerbation and likely RLL pneumonia. The patient was
initially admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous
nebulizers. The patient was transferred to the floor hospital
day 4 on nebulizers q4-6 hours and with improving lung exam. The
patient left against medical advice on transfer to the floor
after being refused escalated doses of narcotics for his chronic
rib pain. The patient demonstrated he was aware of the risks of
leaving against medical advice.
.
1. Shortness of breath/hypoxia: Likely secondary to asthma flare
in the setting of a possible RLL pneumonia. Patient received
solumedrol 125 mg IV x1 at OSH and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
intensive care unit. The patient left against medical advice on
transfer to the floor after being refused increased doses of
narcotics. The patient demonstrated he was aware of the risks of
leaving against medical advice. The patient received prednisone
70 mg po x 1 the day prior to discharge and prednisone 60 mg x 1
the day of discharge; the patient was discharged with a
prednisone taper. The patient was using nebulizer treatments
every four to six hours prior to leaving against medical advice.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
treatment of community acquired pneumonia and was given
levofloxacin prior to leaving against medical advice.
.
2. Chest pain/rib pain: Patient has a history of rib fracture in
the past. The patient has a history of chronic pain in this area
and narcotic seeking. EKG without changes and the patient ruled
out for myocardial infarction. The patient was given percocet
and morphine in the intensive care unit. The patient left
against medical advice on transfer to the floor after being
refused escalated doses of narcotics.
.
3. Hypertension: The patient's outpatient regimen included
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and lisinopril 20 mg daily. The
patient was hypertensive during admission, likely secondary to
high-dose steroids. Lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily
during admission; the patient was not given a prescription for
the increased lisinopril when he left against medical advice.
Further management deferred to the patient's primary care
doctor.
.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is
0.7-0.9 and was 1.3 on admission. The patient's creatinine
improved with fluid resuscitation, indicating a pre-renal
etiology. The patient's creatinine was 1.1 the day the patient
left against medical advice.
.
5. History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient was in
normal sinus rhythm throughout hospitalization. The patient is
not on anticoagulation at baseli
