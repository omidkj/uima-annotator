MRI spine:
IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate canal narrowing and intrathecal crowding at L3-4
with extensive
degenerative endplate edema.

2. Severe right foraminal narrowing at L3-4 with likely
compression of the
right L3 root.

3. Potential compression of the right L5 root secondary to a
right
paracentral disc herniation at L4-5.

4. Equivocal signal abnormality in the lower cervical spine for
which a
dedicated cervical spine MRI is recommended.

5. Additional degenerative changes as detailed.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 y/o F w/ chronic back pain s/p L4-5 laminectomy in [**2183**], HTN,
HLD, GERD p/w worsening low back pain, weakness and urinary
retention.

.
# Lower Back Pain/Weakness/Urinary Retention: Exam concerning
for cauda equina however, MRI w/o evidence of this.  MRI was
notable for spinal stenosis and in the setting of persistent
pain and urinary retention orthospine was consulted who
recommended decompressive surgery.  Patient underwent a
non-diagnostic MRI c-spine.  Pain services was consulted and
patient was pain controlled w/ dilaudid pca, valium, tazadine
and gabapentin.  Patient was transfered to the Orthopedic Spine
service and taken to surgery on [**2185-5-2**] for an L3-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU
in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for
postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were
given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled
with a PCA. On [**2185-5-3**] she returned to the operating room for a
scheduled L3-S1 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged
2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note
for further details. The second surgery was also without
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a
stable condition. Postoperative HCT was low and she was
transfused PRBCs with good effect. She was transfered to the
SICU for low oxygen saturation.  Chest x-ray showed a pneumonia
and she was started on antibiotics.  She intermittently spiked
fevers for which an incentive spirometer was encouraged.  A
bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at the time of the
posterior surgery remained in place until postop day one when it
was removed. She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then
diet was advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to
oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed
on POD#3 from the second procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital course was otherwise
unremarkable. On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile
with stable vital sign
