Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for fever, low Hct, new a-fib, CHF.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
CTA of abdomen/pelvix
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
89F s/p remote CABG underwent left main stent [**2196-11-21**] at [**Hospital1 18**],
then had a relook for atypical pain [**2196-12-8**] with patent stent
but c/b left femoral artery bleed, s/p balloon tamponade and
stablizied. Pt was D/C'd to [**Hospital1 **] rehab. Pt has a hx
of spinal stenosis and has been complaining of worsening back
pain since he could not get his pain shot due to [**Hospital1 **]. Per
Rehab, pt c/o worseing back pain and also DOE. EKG with
?ischemic changes; tx with nitro, morphine. Pt c/o abdominal
pain/ back pain since the cath. Pain and SOB got worse and
initially planned to tx to [**Hospital1 **] but re-reouted b/c pt unstable. On
arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be febrile T102, hypotension
70/40, new a-fib, CHF (+CXR, BNP 1220). Pt transiently on Neo
for hypotension, received PRBC + IVF. WBC noted for 21.3 and Hct
26.4 (31.6 on [**12-17**]). Pt was started on Digoxin and Amiodarone
for a-fib, received IV Lasix. BCx + UCx grew MRSA and was
started on Vanc, Timentin, and Levofloxacin. She was ruled out
by enzymes. Since she had severe back pain, worrisome for
worsening RP bleed given Hct and was transferred.

Past Medical History:
1) coronary artery disease
2) hypertension
3) dyslipidemia
4) hypothyroidism
5) dejenerative joint disease
6) h/o spinal stenosis - treated with epidural injections
7) COPD
8) hiatal hernia
9) s/p cholecystectomy
[**02**]) chronic renal insufficiency (crn. baseline 1.8)

Social History:
Quit smoking 30yrs ago. No alcohol. Lives alone in senior
houing.  Ambulates with cane.

Family History:
mother - ca
father - MI at age 60

Physical Exam:

GEN: Appears somnolent, on shovel mask, minimally conversant,
seems to be in pain.
HEENT: NC/AT, nl conjunctiva, anicteric sclera, neck supple, no
neck stiffness, mucous membrane dry

Lungs: decreased BS at the bases, +expiratory wheezes
bilaterally
Abd: +guiac, diffuse abdominal pain to palpation, non-focal, no
rebound.
Back: No spinal tenderness to palpation but pain at paraspinal,
cervical region
Ext: No edema, 1+ DP bilaterally, [**2-5**]+ carotids bilaterally, no
bruit
Neuro: somnolent, moving all 4 extremitities, no posturing,
PERRL, EOMI, tongue midline, symmetric facial expression.
Unable to assess higher cognitive function as pt was somnolent.

Pertinent Results:
ABD/PELVIX CT [**1-4**], [**1-6**] (from OSH): Stable L RP bleed [**1-6**]
slightly larger. +dilated intrahepatic and common bile duct.
adrenal gland atenuation, large umbilical hernia, multiple
diverticuli.

CXR [**1-4**]: c/w CHF

EKG: A-fib in 74 BPM, RBBB, nl axis, nl ST changes.

RUQ U/S: Status-post cholecystectomy. Prominent common bile duct
without evidence of stones or sludge within the bile duct.

CXR: Probable CHF with small pleural effusions. Small focal
ill-defined opacities in right upper lobe, right lung base, and
left lower lobe are consistent with multifocal areas of
pneumonia. No prior films for comparison. Correlate clinically
and with follow-up after therapy.

CTA ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2197-1-8**]):
1) Bilateral pleural effusions slightly increased from previous
exam.
2) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and
its major branches as described. However, normal appearing bowel
with patency of the mesenteric vasculature; no evidence for
bowel ischemia.
3) Uncomplicated anterior abdominal wall hernia
4) Interval mild decrease in size of left retroperitoneal
hematoma.
5) Persistent common bile duct dilatation and intrahepatic
ductal dilatation with no evidence for choledocholithiasis or
obstructing mass.
6) Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

Echo ([**2197-1-9**]): EF>55%, [**2-5**]+ MR; essentially unchanged from
[**2196-12-9**]

ERCP ([**2197-1-14**]): Five fluoroscopic spot film images were
obtained from ERCP. The images show cannulation of the common
bile duct with opacification with contrast. The common bile duct
is massively dilated. The films then show passing of a wire into
the intrahepatic ducts which are also opacified. Opacification
of the intrahepatic ducts show dilatation also. No filling
defects are identified.  Pt got stented in the common bile duct

CT ABD/PEVIS/THIGH: ([**2197-1-17**])
1) Interval development of a right thigh swelling consistent
with hematoma.
2) Interval placement of a PTCA catheter, with subsequent
decrease in intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The PTCA
catheter is seen extending from the right thorax through to the
second portion of the duodenum.
3) Interval decrease in size of left retroperitoneal hematoma.
4) Interval decrease in bilateral pleurarl effusions, with
compressive atelectasis.
5) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdomen aorta and its
major branches as described.
6) Uncomplicated anterior abdominal wall hernia.
7) Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
8) 2.4 x 1.9 cm right ovarian cyst, again noted. Ultrasound is
recommended for a patient of this age.
