Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: dyspnea, weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-15**]--cardiac cath with successful stenting of the LMCA, LAD,
and LCX, as well as IABP placement and removal.
[**10-21**]--re-look cardiac cath showing patent stents
[**10-24**]--PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
.
HPI: 87yo woman with a h/o HTN, dyslipidemia, mild
dementia/short term memory deficit, who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] for urgent cath after presenting there with SOB,
found to have NSTEMI. Pt was in her USOH until several days PTA
when she started "not feeling well." Denied CP, reported
progressively increasing SOB and lightheadedness. Was seen at
[**Hospital3 **] on DOA where she was noted to have an initial
SBP of 89, and had an initial EKG that was reported to show
sinus bradycardia to 51bpm, ST elev in aVR and V1, ST dep in II,
III, aVF. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cath, which
she received immediately upon arrival. Of note, she was without
symptoms of shortness of breath, CP, or any other complaints
upon arrival. The cath revealed significant CAD: LMCA clear; LAD
99% ostial with thrombus; LCx mild ostial, 100% occlusion of
bifurcating OM1 filling via L-to-L collaterals; RCA mod
calcified with 60% diffuse mid and 100% PDA disease, with PDA
filling via R-to-L collaterals. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of CT [**Doctor First Name **] was
consulted for possible CABG but felt pt was not a candidate
given her age, renal failure, dementia. After discussion with
the son/HCP, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] successfully placed one DES in the prox
LAD and one DES in the LCx, such that the stents each extended
to the LMCA ostium. An IABP was also placed prophylactically
prior to the stenting. The final result was LAD ostium 10%, LCx
ostium 0% stenosis. Pt was transferred to the CCU for management
of her IABP and remained asymptomatic.

ECHO:
[**10-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (20-25%)
with akinesis of the infero-lateral wall, mid to distal septum
and apex. The remaing segmetns are hypokinetic (basal septum and
anterolateral wall move best). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2176-4-11**], there are new regional wall motion
abnormalities involving the septum and apex. Severe pulmonary
hypertension is now detected.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

ECHO
[**10-21**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection
fraction 20 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the
midventricular segments and akinesis of the apex. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Mild
to moderate ([**1-5**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2177-10-15**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
somewhat further reduced (20%).
.
CXR: [**10-21**]: Comparison is made to prior study performed one day
earlier. There has been no significant interval change in
cardiomegaly, interstitial edema, small bilateral pleural
effusions, and left lower lobe atelectasis. Osseous structures
are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.
.
Cath report:
[**10-15**]:
COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system
with severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
no
angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions. The LAD had a
99%
ostial lesion with thrombus. The LCX had mild ostial disease
with a 100%
occlusion of a bifurcating OM1 that filled via left to left
collaterals.
The moderately calcified RCA had 60% diffuse mid vessel disease
with a
100% PDA lesion that filled distally via collaterals.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated right
sided
(mean RA 18 mmHg), pulmonary ([**Location (un) **] PA 36 mmHg), and left sided
pressures
(mean PCWP 30 mmHg) with a mildly depressed cardiac index (2.1
l/min/m2).
  3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
  4. A 30 cc 7 French intraaortic balloon pump was placed via
the left
femoral artery.
  5. Successful stenting of the LMCA into the LAD and LCX with
two
kissing Cypher DES (3.5 x 13 mm in LAD, 3.0 x 13 mm in LCX).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful placement of an intraaortic balloon pump.
4. Successful stenting of the LMCA, LAD, and LCX.

Cath [**10-21**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
demonstrated
two vessel coronary artery disease.  The kissing stents in LMCA
and
proximal LAD and LCX were widely patent.  The LAD had mild
luminal
irregularities.  Spasm was relieved from previous case.  The
ostial
diagonal disease was unchanged.  The OM2 was totally occluded
and filled
retrogradely via L
