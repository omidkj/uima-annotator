Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis with placement of a pericardial drain


History of Present Illness:
41 y/o woman w/type I diabetes, HTN, HL, dCHF, history of PE
([**4-12**]) s/p IVC filter and IVC filter clot who has been off
coumadin since [**11-13**] (patient says a doctor told her to but has
not been to see her PCP) who presents with 3 days of increasing
lower extremity edema and 3 days of sharp left-sided substernal
chest pain that radiates to the back which is the same as her
previous chest pain. Patient also reports shortness of breath,
mild cough, nausea and one episode of emesis. Patient denies
dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, vision change, headache,
palpitations, radiation of the pain to her jaw or arm,

Of note she had an admission in [**2105-3-8**] for LE edema (at
this time patient had also stopped taking her coumadin) and was
found to have a IVC filter clot, IR attempted thrombectomy but
the patient developed respiratory distress thought to be due to
anaphyaxis vs. PE despite being premedicated with steroids and
benadryl and she was d/c'd on lovenox bridge to coumadin. During
that admission she was evaluated by heme/onc and had a negative
hypercoagulable work up. She has also had multiple previous
admissions for similar chest pain, work ups unrevealing and the
patient has left AMA due to not receiving IV dilaudid. It is
documented in OMR that she has multiple hospital admissions in
the [**Location (un) 86**] Hospitals but has DNKd multiple PCP in our system.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4 110 175/72 22 96%on RA. On
labs troponin 0.03, INR 1.2. EKG looks like left bundle,
consistent with past. T max 100, got levaquin b/c ?consolidation
on CXR. Also could not get CTA due to dye allergy and can't do a
VQ scan logistically. So she was started her on heparin gtt.
Guaiac positive brown stool. Also got lasix 100mg po daily and
1mg Dilaudid. Current VS, HR 104, on 2L02 (for chest pain).

On the floor the patient reports severe chest pain, unrelenting,
and nausea. No reported improvement in the ED with pain meds,
patient requests phenergan.

the attempt to clear the blockage, she arrested and died. She

blood clot to his heart and died. She has one cousin who died of
a stroke at age 47. She does not know any medical history about
her grandparents on either side.

REPORTS:

LE U/S BL [**2106-1-31**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities within
limits of exam.

CXR [**2106-1-31**]:
1. Patchy opacity at the lung bases may represent atelectasis or
infection.
2. Stable cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.

ECHO [**2106-2-1**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right
atrial [**Month/Day/Year 7216**] collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion
without evidence of tamponade. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Probable [**Month/Day/Year 7216**] dysfunction. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-4-16**],
the size of the pericardial effusion has increased.

MRI CHEST/ABDOMEN [**2106-2-1**]:
Limited examination as the patient was not able to hold her
breath.
1. No central pulmonary emboli, however, segmental PE cannot be
excluded.
2. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with
atelectasis in the
lower lobes. Moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.
3. No evidence of an aortic dissection.
4. Susceptibility artifact is seen from the IVC filter. No
thrombus seen in the visualized IVC below and above the filter.
A wet read was placed in the CCC at the time of the MRI
examination on
[**2106-2-1**].

CXR PA/LA [**2106-2-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiac enlargement, most likely
representing
pericardial effusion, mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions regressing. No new infiltrates.

ECHO [**2106-2-3**]:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular [**Month/Day/Year 7216**] collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-2-1**],
right ventricular collapse is now present.
