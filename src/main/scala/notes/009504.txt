Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Lisinopril / Iodine-Iodine Containing

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, orthopnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-9-2**] - Coronary bypass grafting x5 with the left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and reverse
saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery, obtuse
marginal artery, ramus intermedius artery, and first diagonal
artery.
[**2135-9-2**] - Cardiac Catheterization with placement of an
intra-aortic balloon pump.


History of Present Illness:
51 yo man with DM, HTN, LE claudication, presenting with
worsening dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea for approximately 2
weeks, found to have elevated BNP and TropT 0.4 with CXR
suggestive of pulmonary edema in ED, who developed worsening
dyspnea after receiving contrast for CT to r/u PE.

For two weeks, patient had 3-4 episodes of difficulty breathing
and chest tightness at night, some dyspnea on exertion, and
general malaise.  The chest tightness at night was diffuse with
no radiation, diaphoresis, or nausea, and resolved along with
the difficulty breathing when he stood up and used his inhaler.
He has also noticed productive cough with clear non-bloody
sputum for the past two weeks which has been worsening.

Went to PCP after sx acutely worsened and was found to have low
sats and sinus tach, for which he was sent to ED for PE work up.
 In the ED, EKG wnl, trop 0.4, CXR showed pulmonary edema but he
was persistently tachycardic so CT PE was done. After lying down
and getting contrast for the CTA, he developed worsening dyspnea
with desatting to 80s.
.
He received nitro gtt and 60 of lasix for concern of flash
edema, and benadryl/solumedrol for questionable allergic
reaction. He continued to have SOB so he was put on CPAP/100%
FiO2.  He was satting 100% and feeling much better, so FiO2 was
weaned to 40%. He was put on heparin gtt for possible NSTEMI.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He endorses
calf pain bilaterally when walking for more than half a mile,
which resolves with rest, and has been present for approximately
6 months.

infarction

3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: asthma, present since [**2119**], has

[**2135-9-2**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had a 60% ulcerated
mid
vessel lesion. The LAD had diffuse disease with subtotal
occlusion
after D1. There was slow flow throughout the LAD system.
The origin of the D1 had an 80% stenosis. The Cx system had a
mid vessel
ulcerated 80% stenosis before OM2. The OM1 had diffuse disease
throughout and a proximal 90% stenosis. The RCA had an ostial
80%
stenosis and was a small vessel with diffuse disease throughout.

2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 18 mmHg and a PCWP of 35
mmHg. The
pulmonary pressures were elevated with a PASP of 62 mmHg. The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.6 l/min/m2. The central aortic pressure
was
125/90 mmHg.
3. An intraortic balloon pump was placed sheathed via the right
femoral
artery with diastolic augmentation from 72 to 110 mmHg, with a
MAP of 90
mmHg on [**1-28**] counterpulsation.

[**2135-9-3**] ECHO
The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior and septal
walls and hypokinesis of the inferior and lateral walls.
Ejection fraction of 15-20%. Depressed right ventricular
function. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Views performed with the
ballon pump on 1:4 showed worsened LV function, compared to LV
function with the balloon pump on 1:1.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular dysfunction with
akinesis of the anterior and septal walls. Ejection fraction
15-20%. Severe right ventricular dysfunction. Mild mitral
regurgitation.


Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-9-11**] 1:29 PM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with cabg
Final Report
PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were compared to [**9-9**], [**2135**].

The appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
including
moderate cardiomegaly and mild dilatation of the mediastinum.
There is
interval improvement of the vascular congestion which is
currently minimal.
Bibasal atelectasis is re-demonstrated. Small left pleural
effusion is
present, most likely minimally increased compared to prior
radiograph. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The
post-sternotomy wires appear intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9975**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-9-2**] for workup of
his shortness of breath and chest discomfort. He had evidence of
pulmonary edema with elevated BNP at 2164 and TropT 0.4, most
suggestive of acute heart failure likely secondary to recent
ischemic event. Troponins downtrending on admission.  Pt started
on aspirin, statin, lasix diuresis, and heparin trip.  ECHO was
done and demonstrated extensive left ventricular regional
dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname 9975**] was taken for a cardiac catheterization which
revealed severe left main and three vessel disease. An IABP was
placed and the cardiac surgical service was consulted. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was taken urgently to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels.
