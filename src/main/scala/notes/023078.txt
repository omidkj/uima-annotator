Falls, weight gain, dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
56 yo F with chronic hep c and cirrhosis, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, h/o bowel obstruction, asthma, ascending
aortic aneurysm, who is admitted directly from [**Hospital 6435**] clinic
after presenting today weight gain, frequent falls, increased
dyspnea on exertion, and LUQ pain, found to have new renal
failure.  She relates that she has been experiencing general
decline over the past few months, but has been having more
symptoms in the past 2 weeks.  Has slowly gained about 30 lbs
(unsure over what time period) in the form of worsening LE edema
and increasing abdominal girth to the point that her pants no
longer fit.  Over this same time period, she has started falling
more because she feels like her legs feel heavy and weak, and in
the past week or so has fallen almost every day.  Yesterday she
had a fall where she scratched her leg on the metal of her car
door, which subsequently bled profusely ("at least a pint") and
required a two-layer stitch closure.  Has also been having
diarrhea for the past few months, feels like food "goes right
through" her, small liquidy stools without associated abdominal
pain.
.
Now over the past few weeks, she has been feeling nauseated and
vomiting nearly every AM (clear, non-bloody).  She also has been
experiencing worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past few
weeks, limiting her to [**11-7**] feet walking and [**5-24**] steps at a
time on stairs.  She doesn't think its her asthma, doesn't feel
wheezy.  No chest pain or orthopnea. Has been very thirsty and
drink 2L H2O per day, but has been urinating less. Now in the
past few days, started having LUQ pain that is worse with
breathing, feels like it radiates to the back, cannot
characterize the quality further.  Given all of these worsening
symptoms, she finally presented today to her PCP.
.
At her PCP's office, her exam was notable for [**3-22**]+ pitting edema
of the lower extremities and a laceration on her left leg.  Peak
flow was 355, and CXR was normal.  Labs revealed Cr elevation to
2.6 from baseline 0.6 in [**Month (only) 1096**], macrocytic anemia with hct of
26 (from 37), alb 2.1, and plts 145.  Given her new acute renal
failure and all these worrisome symptoms, she was directly
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
.
Currently, she is sitting in bed comfortably and can relate her
story.  She appears chronically ill, but she can easily give her
history and cooperate with exam
.

Imaging:
[**2172-4-7**]
- Liver/Gallbladder U/S:
Liver has a coarsened echotexture and nodular contour consistent
with provided history of cirrhosis. No discrete lesion
identified. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation present. The gallbladder is not distended and without
gallstones. Gallbladder wall
thickening is evident, likely due to chronic liver disease. The
common bile duct is not dilated, measuring 5 mm. The pancreas is
not well evaluated due to overlying bowel gas, though
demonstrated portions are unremarkable. The spleen is not
enlarged, measuring 11 cm. Demonstrated portions of the right
kidney, inferior vena cava and aorta are unremarkable.
Moderate-to-large amount of ascites identified in all four
abdominal quadrants.
DOPPLER: Doppler assessment of the main portal vein shows
patency and
hepatopetal flow. Normal waveforms are identified within the
right middle and left hepatic veins and main hepatic artery.
IMPRESSION:
1. Coarsened echotexture consistent with provided history of
cirrhotic liver.
2. Hepatic vasculature is patent with appropriate directionality
of flow and waveforms.
3. Ascites.
4. Thickened gallbladder wall. In absence of gallbladder
distention or
gallstones, this is most consistent with sequela of chronic
liver disease.

[**2172-4-8**]
- Renal U/S:
The left kidney is 10.6 cm and the right kidney is 11.2 cm.
Subtle details of both kidneys are obscured by patient habitus.
Within that constraint there is no hydronephrosis or
nephrolithiasis. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. There is
moderate ascites.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.

Interventions:
[**2172-4-8**]
- U/S guided paracentesis by IR
Uncomplicated diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis yielding
950 mL of clear yellow fluid.
