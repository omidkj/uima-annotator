Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Oxycodone / hydrochlorothiazide / trazodone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, back pain, elevated trops, transferred for cardiac cath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4; left
    inframammary artery to left anterior descending artery
    and saphenous vein grafts to obtuse marginal, diagonal,
    and posterior descending arteries.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.


History of Present Illness:
60 yo female with hx CAD (no interventions), bicuspid aortic
valve, peripheral arterial disease and cerebrovascular disease
with recent outpt abnormal ST presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] via
EMS with SOB, and R sided scapular back pain. Her shortness of
breath has been progressive over the past week. Today, had
associated back pain for which she took total of 8 sublingual NG
today with no relief prior to arrival at ED. Her pain was
associated with diaphoresis and was noted to have RR of 30 by
EMS. At [**Hospital1 46**], her initial EKG showed ST depressions in leads
I, avL, and V5-V6. Her first troponin was 0.6 with repeat of
3.26. She received morphine, lasix 40mg IV, aspirin, nitro
(which was then held for hypotension), and plavix. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath. VS prior to transfer:
104./20, hr 70 sr, resp 16, sat 97% on 4L nc, afeb, 0/10 pain.

.
In the cath lab, pt noted to have severe 3VD not ammenable to
intervention. Pt was hypertensive so started on nitro drip.
However, after sheath was pulled, BP dropped to 60s systolic for
which she got atropine, fluids and dopamine. Within a few
minutes, pt was feeling well again.
 .
At baseline, pt avoids strenous activity because of claudication
in her R leg. Her back pain has been considered her anginal
equivalent and she experiences this intermittently when exerting
herself (ie doing laundry, grocery shopping), usually resolves
with rest or SL NG. Pain is occasionally associated with
bilateral arm pain.
.
