HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old
ambidextrous woman with history of untreated hypertension,

asthma attack last month with frequent coughing after which
she noticed to be gradually more fatigued and lacking
interest in daily activities.  In the last 5 days, she had
been having headache (bilateral, the left greater than right
squeezing pain associated with nausea and worse in the
morning).  She has had several vomiting episodes in these
days and was taken to a clinic yesterday, where her blood
pressure was 180/130.  She received a prescription for
antihypertensive medications but did not want to take the
drug because of bad experience with past antihypertensive
medications.  Last night she could not sleep because of a
headache and today felt worse.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where a non-contrast head CT showed some bleeding.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

vomiting, weakness, and weight loss greater than 10 pounds in

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Non-contrast head CT showed right
periatrial intraparenchymal hemorrhage and intraventricular
hemorrhage with some blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given her hemorrhage, her
blood pressure was controlled for goal of systolic blood
pressure of less than 140.  She had an MRI of the head that
was done showing many areas of microbleeds in the right lateral
ventricle, cerebellum, pons, and basal ganglia.  These other
microbleeds are suggestive of amyloid angiopathy.  She was ruled
out for myocardial infarction.  Lipid panel was obtained and
found to be normal with cholesterol 180, triglyceride 133,  HDL
70, and an LDL of 83.  Repeat head CT was done several days in
the hospital course given continued headache and was found to
be unchanged.  Her blood pressure was finally controlled on a
triple therapy of beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and
hydralazine.  She did have anxiety in taking medications, so
Celexa was started.
