Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male with a history of  DM2, pericarditis (known since
[**2170-5-16**], CAD presenting from cardiologist visit with pleuritic
chest pain worse when lying down, SOB. O2 sat 92% (nml 96%)
worsening over two days. Complaints of pleuritic chest pain and
shortness of breath beginning one week prior led to echo [**7-9**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which demonstrated an EF of 40%, trace regurg,
thickened mitral valve,  increasing pericardial effusion
circumferential, no evidence of tamponade. Office visit this AM
due to increasing sob leading to inability to sleep, chest pain.
Echo demonstrating 3 cm anterior effusion with RA inversion and
no signs of tamponade. Pt sent to ED.
 In ED, vitals 97.1, Hr 58, BP 150/76, RR 20. Hydral was given.K
repleted 40 mg. Nurse found patient stupurous, FBG noted to be
23. Given 3 amps of D50, rose to normal. Pt continued to be
sleepy but gradually increasing in alertness. Head CT non
contrast demonstrating lacunar infarcts in the past.
Admitted to CCU for hemodynamic monitoring, setting of
pericardial effusion, obtundation, possible hx of CHF. Blood
pressure elevated to systolic 200.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
Echo [**2170-7-9**]
infero posterior thinned scarred and akinetic LV, EF 40%.
Thickened mitral valve with trace regurgitation. Persistent
circumferential pericardial effusion slightly increased since
[**2170-5-25**], no evidence of tamponade.
.
Head CT [**2170-7-13**]
Stable appearance of the brain from [**2169-11-21**], without
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic lacunar infarcts
within both basal ganglia, unchanged.
.
CXR [**2170-7-13**]: A/P. No blunting of costophrenic angles. Moderate
cardiomegaly. No evidence of florid pulmonary edema.
.
[**7-14**] TTE
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral wall. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a moderate
sized pericardial effusion (1.5-2.0 cm). There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2170-1-8**], the effusion may be slightly bigger
but there is no signs of tamponade.
.
[**7-16**]- TTE
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. LV systolic
function
appears depressed with lateral wall hypokinesis. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion (small anteriorly; moderate inferolaterally). There is
brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-7-14**],
the effusion appears similar in size.





Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, stents, CHF EF 40% presented
to PCP with shortness of breath pleuritic chest pain, referred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Known 3 cm pericardial effusion, echo in ED with no
evidence of tamponade. patient became unarousable in ED with
blood sugar 28, given 3 AMPS D50 and admitted to the CCU.
.
# Pericardial effusion: has known h/o pericarditis with
worsening chest pain and SOB. Pulsus currently approx 10 cm.
Echo shows evidence of RA collapse. Monitored with serial pulsus
checks. Increased to 14 several hours into admission and then
regressed to 10. Considered related to infectious, viral or
autoimmune causes.  Repeated echo in preparation of possible
pericardiocentesis given extent of effusion and concern for
tamponade. TTE [**7-14**] with no evidence of significant worsening
effusion of tamponade. 1.5-2 cm pericardial effusion. Continued
to monitor. Treated pain with cochicine [**Hospital1 **], per PCP pt did not
achieve any relief from NSAIDS. Rheumatology consult to
determine treatment options for symptomatic pericardial effusion
unable to be managed surgically. Obtained RF, histone, [**Doctor First Name **] and
UA for possible drug induced lupus or other cause of
pericarditis. Also considered hydral as possible cause. Patient
was discharged in stable condition with follow up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# CAD: s/p CABG and stents: ECG unchanged. No current s/sx
ischemia . Continued ASA, [**Last Name (un) **], BB, statin, zetia. Started
norvasc 5 mg and increased hydralazine to 50 TID to stabilize BP
regimen, discharged on [**Hospital1 **] dose. Did not feel as though hydral
likely cause of pericarditis and subsequent effusion.
.
# Pump: EF 40%. Clinically appeared relatively euvolemic, though
difficult to ascertain. CXR with no remarkable pulm edema. BP
markedly elevated, likely in setting of med non-compliance.
Acutely controlled BP with nitro gtt on admission. Restart po BP
meds - carvedilol, hydral, losartan, with subsequent holding
hydral and also held imdur while on nitro gtt.
.
# Rhythm: NSR to brady currently. Monitored on tele. Carvedilol
with holding parameters.
.
# altered mental status: likely [**2-22**] hypoglycemia in setting of
pt takes large dose of lantus usually, decreased po intake on
day of admission. Has signs of prior lacunar infarcts on head
CT. Likely pt is slow to improve mental status from
hypoglycemia. Head CT did not show acute bleed.  Followed FS q2
hrs treated FS>200 with insulin. Held lantus. LFT's with no
evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Pt became alert and
oriented, talkative within one day and was stable to discharge.
.
# DM: hypoglycemia a
