CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-5-28**] 8:09 AM

Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angles are again
seen with minimal atelectasis in the lower lobes. The heart size
is moderately enlarged status post cardiac surgery. The
pulmonary vessels are slightly indistinct reflecting minimal
pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION:

1. Small bilateral pleural effusion.

2. Scattered atelectasis in the lower lobes.

3. Probable early edema.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Symmetric LVH. Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with RV
pressure overload.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Moderate AS (AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2) No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Suboptimal image
quality. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). A focal wall
motion abnormality can not be fully excluded to to suboptimal
image quality.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 1 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

POST CPB

1. Grossly normal biventricular systolic function though poor
image quality prevents complete exclusion of a focal wall motion
abnormality.
2. Bileaflet mechanical prosthesis in the aortic position. The
valve is only very poorly seen but it does appear well seated
and both leaflets appear to be moving normally. Aortic
regurgitation can not be apppreciated secondary to poor image
quality. The maximum gradient across the valve is 64 mm Hg with
a mean of 31 at a cardiac output of about 6 liters/min. The
effective orifice area is about 1.1 cm2.
3. The mitral regurgitation remains mild.
4. The thoracic aorta appears intact.
5. No other cahnges from pre-bypass study.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] informed of all findings in the operating room
at the time of the study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**5-21**] where she underwent
an AVR. She was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She
was extubated post operatively. She was transfused for HCT 20.
She was transferred to the floor on POD #3. She was started on
heparin gtt and coumadin for her mechanical valve. She continued
to use nasal CPAP at night as prior to surgery. On Dc her INR is
2.0. She is off the heperiin drip. Pt foley, PW , CT were all
DC"d without sequele. She did work with PT. They recommended
rehab.

Pt top have INR folowed at rehab. Rehab to set up INR draws with
PCP on her discharge from rehab.
