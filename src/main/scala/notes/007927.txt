Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia, dehydration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line

History of Present Illness:
37M 5 days s/p uncomplicated left L5 MDFH and left L4
foraminotomy for L4-L5 radiculopathy/herniation, discharged
[**2155-6-13**], presents to [**Hospital3 4107**] with 3 day h/o fevers and
chills to 103.7 as well as cough.

On arrival to [**Hospital3 **], Pt was febrile to 103.7, with
initial SBP of 77/43, not responsive to 3L bolus of
crystalloids.  His lumbar incision was noted to be clean and
dry.  A chest xray obtained revealed RLL PNA.  His WBC was 12K,
with lactate of 2.1.  After additional L of NS, L of LR and
initiation of phenylephrine low dose, pt became normotensive
(100's/60's) and was mentating normally.  He was treated with
500mg PO flagyl, and 1 gm CTX at [**Hospital1 **].  He was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Pt reports that his radicular symptoms
have completely resolved s/p surgery.

ED Course:
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 72 104/63 20 98%
- trigger for transfer; 89/60 with neo gtt turned off
- EKG: Non-specific ST-T changes.  No significant change from
previous tracing of [**2155-6-9**].

CXR [**2155-6-17**]
Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous
outside
exam performed earlier the same day at 6:54 a.m.  There is new
right internal jugular venous catheter whose tip projects over
the upper SVC.  There is no visualized pneumothorax on this film
noting significant rotation.  Right lower lung consolidation is
again seen but better characterized on previous exam suspicious
for pneumonia.  Left lung is grossly clear.

IMPRESSION:  New right IJ line with tip in the upper SVC.  No
visualized
pneumothorax.  Persistent right lower lung consolidation
compatible with
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
37M 5 days s/p uncomplicated left L5 MDFH and left L4
foraminotomy for L4-L5 radiculopathy/herniation, discharged
[**2155-6-13**], presents to [**Hospital3 4107**] with 3 day h/o fevers and
chills to 103.7 and cough.

# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  Pt recently underwent spinal
surgery and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with post-op fever and septic
shock.  His CXR showed a new RLL infiltrate and he complains of
cough, making pneumonia most likely diagnosis.  His U/A was
clear, surgical site is clean and he does not have any focal
neuro deficits.  Pt was recently intubated for his procedure,
and as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] notes, it seems that he was over sedated at
one point requiring narcan, so the possibility of aspiration is
quite high.  Given that he was only intubated for procedure we
treated his pneumonia as a hospital acquired pneumonia, rather
than ventilator acquired pneumonia.  He was initially covered
with vancomycin and levaquin, and on HD2 he was narrowed to po
levaquin.  Pt remained afebrile without o2 requirement and his
leukocytosis resolved.  He was discharged with a 7 day
antibiotic course for hospital acquired pneumonia.

#Septic Shock:  secondary to pneumonia as above.  On
presentation, pt was febrile to 103F, with leukocytosis and
hypotensive to 70s systolic.  He had evidence of end organ
ischemia with lactate of 2.1 and acute kidney injury with
elevated BUN and cr.  He was treated with early goal directed
therapy and initially volume resuscitated with a total of 7
liters of crystalloid.  Initially his blood pressures did not
respond adequately, so he was started on phenylephrine and after
a central line was placed, he was started on norepinephrine.  By
the time he reached the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] MICU, his blood pressure was
normotensive and vasopressors were discontinued.  His CVP
remained >10 so aggressive volume resuscitation was stopped.
His lactate came down to 0.9 and his acute kidney injury
resolved.  Pt remained normotensive for remainder of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
course.

# s/p Laminectomy - currently no neurological deficits,
radiculopathy is actually improved since surgery.  Incision site
was cdi and his dressing was changed as needed.  At time of
discharge, pt still had staples in place and will need to follow
up with his neuro-surgeon for post-op check and staple removal.
He was continued on post-surgical ppx antibiotics
(dicloxicillin) as pres
