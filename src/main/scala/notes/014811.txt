Pertinent Results:
[**2-27**] CXR: Two views. Comparison with [**2163-2-25**]. A small right
pleural effusion and moderate left pleural effusion are again
demonstrated. There is consolidation in the left lower lobe as
noted previously. The patient is status post median sternotomy
and CABG as before. Mediastinal structures are unchanged in
appearance. The bony thorax is grossly intact. A right internal
jugular catheter remains in place.
Echo [**2-18**]: PREBYPASS: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesia of the inferior and
inferoseptal walls.. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). 2. RV shows mild global free
wall hypokinesis. 3. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. 4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Post
Bypass: 1. Patient is being a- paced and receiving an infusion
of Norepinephrine and Milrinone.
2. LV function slightly improved. RV function slightly improved.
3. Aorta intact post decannulation.
[**2163-2-18**] Carotid Ultrasound and Vein Mapping: 1. No significant
right ICA stenosis (graded as less than 40%). 2. 40-59% left ICA
stenosis. 3. Bilateral greater saphenous vein harvest, lesser
saphenous veins appear patent.
[**2163-2-18**] Aterial Upper Extremity Study: Radial artery
compression eliminates all waveforms on both the right and the
left, i.e., at the first and fifth digit. Compression of the
ulnar artery on both the left and right failed to have any
effect on the waveforms of the first or fifth digit. IMPRESSION:
Findings as stated above which indicate bilateral radial artery
dominance.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 55810**] was admitted under cardiac surgery and underwent
preoperative evaluation. Carotid ultrasound revealed mild to
moderate carotid disease while vein mapping showed patent lesser
saphenous vein(see result section). Arterial upper extremity
study indicated bilateral radial artery dominance. Other than
his chronic renal insufficiency, preoperative evaluation was
otherwise unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. On
[**2-18**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see separate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He was
intermittently transfused to maintain hematocrit near 30% and
was slow to wean from inotropic support. He temporarily required
a Lasix drip for effective diuresis. He was noted to have
episodes of atrial fibrillation and was started Amiodarone and
beta blockade. He had further decline in renal function. His
creatinine peaked to 3.3 on postoperative day three. He
otherwise made gradual improvements and eventually transferred
to the SDU on postoperative day five. His renal function
gradually improved. He remained in a normal sinus rhythm without
further episodes of atrial fibrillation. He was started on
antibiotics for urinary tract infection on post-op day ten. He
appeared to be doing well and on post-op day eleven was
discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
