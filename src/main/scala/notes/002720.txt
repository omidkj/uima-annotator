Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with 2 drug-eluting stents to
Right Coronary Artery

History of Present Illness:
55 year old male with history of Hypertension who presented to
ED with 2hrs of sudden onset crushing 10/10 chest pain radiating
to left arm while vacuuming at work, also with diaphoresis.
Initial EKG in the ED showed ST changes in leads II, III, aVF,
and he was given morphine, aspirin.  Second EKG showed ST
elevations in leads II, III, avF with reciprocal T wave
inversions, and STEMI pager was activated.  Patient was started
on heparin drip and integrilin and was sent for emergent Cardiac
Catheterization. Patient continued to have 10/10 chest pain
until end of catheterization procedure.  Two drug eluting stents
placed in mid RCA, where 100% occlusion was found.  Had
percutaneous closure right groin.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient was chest pain free with no
other symptoms.
.
Patient notes that he has been having similar chest pain, though
significantly more mild, while in bed resting about 2 nights per
week for the past two years.  He describes the pain as very mild
and often radiating to his right arm, slowly increasing in
frequency and intensity.

.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
pulmonary embolism.  He has had history of GI bleeding [**Month (only) **]
[**2169**].

Cardiology Report	Cardiac Cath	Study Date of [**2172-1-30**]

1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one
vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease. The
LAD had mild diffuse disease but no angiographically significant
stenoses. The LCx had no angiographically apparent disease but
had a
small aneurysmal segment in mid-vessel. The RCA was occluded in
its
mid-portion.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate systemic
arterial
hypertension with SBP 162 mmHg and DBP 106 mmHg.
3.  Successful PCI of the RCA with overlapping 3.5x28mm and
3.5x15mm
Promus DES, post-dilated to 3.75mm in the proximal and
mid-segments.
4.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a
Perclose device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
3. Successful PCI of the RCA with DES.

FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
The
mediastinum demonstrates mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
The cardiac
silhouette is within normal limits for size. No effusion or
pneumothorax is
noted. There is mild gaseous distention of the stomach
incidentally noted.
Mild degenerative disease is seen throughout the thoracic spine.
No displaced
fractures are evident.

IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the
basal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 55 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Very mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation with
normal valve morphology suggestive of underlying papillary
muscle dysfunction. Mild thoracic aorta dilation.

hours of substernal crushing 10/10 chest pain and evolving ST
elevations.
.
# s/p STEMI:
Patient had 2 hours of chest pain by time of arrival in ED,
continued chest pain through Catheterization until end of
procedure, found to have 100% occlusion mid RCA. Two
drug-eluting stents placed in mid RCA.  ST elevations in
