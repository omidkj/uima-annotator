Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8-1.0cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known lastname 39363**]
before bypass..

POST-BYPASS:

Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Trace MR>
The aortic prosthesis is stable and functioning well with a
residual mean gradient of 12 mm of Hg.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2195-12-28**] for heparin bridge from coumadin and
preoperative workup for aortic valve replacement.  On [**2195-12-29**] he
was brought to the operating room for aortic valve replacement,
see operative report for further details.  He received cefazolin
for perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the
intensive care unit in stable condition. Extubated that evening
and remained in ICU for BP mgmt. Coumadin started for mechanical
valve. Transferred to the floor on POD #2 to begin increasing
his activity level. Gently diuresed toward his preop weight.
Creatinine was at baseline at the time of discharge.  Lopressor
was titrated up to 75 [**Hospital1 **] for hypertension and he was to resume
his home dose of Metformin for mildly elevated blood sugars.
Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol. On POD 7 he
continued to make good progress - his incisions were healing
well, he was ambulating with assistance and he was tolerating an
oral diet.  His INR was 2.1 at the time of discharge.  He was
cleared for discharge to [**Hospital3 30191**] Rehabilitation & Nursing
Center - [**Location (un) 22287**] on POD #7. Target INR 2.5-3.5 for mechanical
valve - Coumadin 5 mg to be given [**1-5**]. All f/u appts were
advised.
