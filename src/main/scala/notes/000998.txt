History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with COPD, CAD, CHF sent in from [**Hospital **] rehab, russian
speaking only.  History from daughter and [**Hospital 100**] rehab notes.
Per the daughter she was called by [**Hospital 100**] rehab with concerns
about her mother.  [**Name (NI) **] mother's urine output had decreased she
had a new oxygen requirement, low blood pressures and poor oral
intake.  The note from [**Hospital 100**] rehab is confusing as to what
exactly was going on in terms of blood pressure however it does
state that her lisinopril was stopped and she was started on
IVF.  A CXR was checked which revealed a new right sided pleural
effusion.  Labs at [**Hospital 100**] rehab were notable for a potassium of
6 without peaked T-waves, an increase in her creatinine from 2.2
on [**1-27**] to 4.0 on [**2-2**] with an associated drop in her bicarb
to 18.  She received a kayexalate enema for her hyperkalemia.
.
She was also started on imipenem for a presumed ESBL UTI.  The
patients daughter initially wanted to keep her out of the
hospital, however she asked the patient
.
In the ED, initial vs were 96.6 58 97/67 16 94% 4L.  She
received vancomycin, levaquin and flagyl for initial presumption
of sepsis NOS.  She received 2L of NS with no improvement in her
lactate.  She was intermittently hypotensive to the 80's and
responded to a second 2L of NS.  An EKG revealed AFIB without
significant changes.  She had a non-contrast adbdominal CT to
look for a source of infection which was unrevealing.  CXR
revealed the aformentioned new right pleural effusion.  Of note
her UE BPs were unreliable in the ED, and the ED resident
attempted to check them via doppler, he was unable to find them
and bedside ultrasound revealed no radial pulses despite warm
well perfused hands.  Several attempts were made at placing a
right femoral a-line which failed and finally a left femoral
a-line was placed. Two 18 gauge peripherals were placed as the
patients daughter was refusing central line.  Peripheral
levophed was started prior to leaving the ED.
.
On the floor, she remained unresponsive to a 250cc NS bolus with
MAPs in the low 60's.

IMPRESSION:
1. Partially imaged moderate right and small left pleural
effusions with
overlying atelectasis. Cardiomegaly, in conjunction with diffuse
subcutaneous
edema and mesenteric haziness suggests volume overload. Small
amount of
perihepatic fluid. Presacral edema.
2. 2 to 3 small fluid density rounded structures along the
inferior medial
border of the right lobe of the liver, of unclear etiology.
Recommend
clinical correlation with history of malignancy, superinfection
cannot be
excluded.
3. Extensive colonic diverticulosis, without evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
[**2-2**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of moderate-to-large right pleural
effusion with
overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be
excluded.
2. Persistent cardiomegaly. No overt pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, this is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who was transferred from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of
hypotension, hypoxia, and acute on chronic kidney injury
secondary to urosepsis.  She was admitted to the MICU and
despite pressor support, fluid resuscitation, and appropriate
antibiotics, it soon became clear that the patient's clinical
status would not recover as evidenced by increasing lactate and
worsening acidemia.  The patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) 2951**], was
informed of the patient's worsening clinical status and given
her poor prognosis, it was decided to change her code status
from DNR/DNI to CMO. The patient passed away shortly after
institution of a morphine drip and withdrawal of pressors.  The
patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) 2951**], was present at bedside and refused
autopsy.  Time of death was 4:45AM.  The following summarizes
her hospital course:
.
#. Urosepsis: The patient presented with a floridly positive U/A
in the setting of gross pyuria, hypotension, hypothermia,
leukocytosis, and increased respiratory rate all c/w infectious
etiology.  UTI with sepsis is the most likely source. Lactate
was initially 3.3 and the patient was fluid resuscitated. Blood
and urine cultures were drawn and pending at time of death. CT
scan was unremarkable. She was started on pressors.
Meropenem/Vancomycin were started out of concern for ESBL UTI
given history of same. Levophed was changed to phenylephrine out
of concern for tachycardia. CVP was 20 in setting of 4+ TR. On
HD #2, lactate began trending up and phenylephrine was again
changed to Levophed in addition to vasopressin. She was
administered additional fluid boluses, but her lactate trended
up to 7.5 and she was acidemic with a pH of 7.05.  Her daughter,
[**Name (NI) 2951**], was informed of her worsening clinical prognosis and it
was decided to change to patient's code status to CMO.
.
#. Acute on Chronic Renal Faillure:  Cr was initially 4, up from
baseline of 1. Thought to be [**3-10**] ischemic ATN in the setting of
septic shock. On HD #2, Cr improved to 3.5 with IVFs.
.
#. Lactic acidosis: 3.3 on transfer to ICU. Likely [**3-10**] to septic
shock.  Initially, lactate improved with IVF but on HD#2 it
began rising and peaked at 7.5. Pressors were administered as
described above.
