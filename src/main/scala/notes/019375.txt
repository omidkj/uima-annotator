Admission Date:  [**2160-12-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-12-15**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 77 year old woman
with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, NSVT, hypertension, high cholesterol and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who was admitted to the
Service with a right MCA stroke.She was originally on the
Neurology Service for treatment of an acute stroke with severe
left hemiparesis.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
and the Medicine Service when the patient was found to be
tachypneic, hypoxic, and tachycardic.  The patient was found
to have aspiration pneumonia with heavy growth of Methicillin
Soon after admission, the
patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response and  Cardiology/ Electrophysiology was consulted.  The
patient was started on Amiodarone.Anticoagulation was deferred
initially because of possible neurologic risk.
The patient failed a swallow evaluation on [**2160-12-5**], and
subsequently had PEG
placement  by the Gastrointestinal Service.
  The patient stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit,
and never required intubation..
The patient was given Flagyl, Levaquin and Vancomycin for
aspiration pneumonia and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus. The patient also received chest PT, suctioning and
frequent nebulizers.  The patient continued to improve and had
decreased secretions.  The patient also continued to have
periods of atrial fibrillation.

Throughout the hospital stay the patient also had an
echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 30 to 35%.
She did have a non- ST elevation myocardial infarction with a
peak component of 38 and CK of 5653 on [**2160-12-5**].  The
patient was also at risk for NSVT and electrophysiology
considered her not a candidate for an AICD should she have
NSVT due to her acute infection and poor status at the time.

Per report, the patient was taken to the Emergency Department
on admission on [**2160-12-4**] after being found down at her
house.  The patient was found between the floor and her bed
and is unknown how long exactly the patient was in there.
The son suspected about 24 hours according to the notes on
admission.  Prior to the incident, the patient was
independent with her activities of daily living and did the
cooking.

use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to the Medicine Service,
afebrile.  Blood pressure 116/50; heart rate 73; respirations
22; O2 saturation 91% on room air.  In general, the patient
was in no acute distress, comfortable.  Has a right gaze
preference.  HEENT unremarkable.  Lungs with no wheezes but
coarse breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly and decreased
breath sounds at the bases.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1, S2.  Soft systolic murmur at left sternal border.
Abdomen soft, with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities warm
with no edema bilaterally.  Bruises on dorsum of the foot and
right hip from falling.  No erythema.  Neurological:  Alert
and oriented times three.  Left neglect in shin on left
although can identify left arm.  Unable to test strength
because the patient is not following commands.  Reflexes
symmetrical bilaterally.  Left facial droop.  Tongue deviates

LABORATORY:  On admission to Medicine, white blood cell count
17.3, hematocrit 35.4, potassium 3.8, creatinine 0.7, BUN 24,
calcium 7.9, phosphorus 3.1, magnesium 1.9.  The patient's
INR was 2.5 on [**2160-12-14**].  Triglycerides 122, HDL 35, LDL
89.  S-PEP negative.  Clostridium difficile toxin assay sent
on [**2160-12-12**], was positive for Clostridium difficile.
Sputum grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Urine cultures negative.  Blood cultures negative.

Carotid Doppler showed minimal plaque to the right and 40%
carotid stenosis on left.  No evidence of obstruction.

Lower extremity non-invasive showed no evidence of deep vein
thrombosis.

CT scan of head on admission showed a large area of low
attenuation involving [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter in the
distribution of the right MCA with effacement of the adjacent
sulci and mild mass effect in the adjacent basal ganglion.
No evidence of hemorrhage. No shift of midline structures.
Ventricles symmetric and not enlarged.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
summarized as above in the HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS up
until admission to the Medicine Service on [**2160-12-10**].  After
admission to Medicine, the patient continued to do well and
was weaned off her oxygen completely and on [**2160-12-14**], the
patient's O2 saturation on room air was 98%.

The patient had a successful PEG placed and began to receive
tube feeds as per the Nutrition recommendations.  The patient
also became much more alert and awake throughout the
admission and knew that she had pneumonia and that she had a
stroke.  The patient was also continued on her amiodarone
taper.  The patient had no runs of NSVT that were appreciable
on Telemetry on the Floor.

The patient did have copious diarrhea.  Stool was sent for a
Clostridium difficile assay and the patient did have positive
Clostridium difficile. The patient will be continued on
Flagyl for two more weeks.  After two weeks, another
Clostridium difficile assay should be checked and if positive
she should be continued for two weeks after that.

The patient is also on Vancomycin intravenously for
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus sputum and she
needs another week of treatment for that.  The patient has
been on Levaquin and received the full course of seven out of
