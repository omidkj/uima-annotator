Diagnostics:
CXR [**2183-3-17**]: IMPRESSION: Interstitial prominence which could
reflect edema or atypical infection. Correlate clinically
CXR [**2183-3-18**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the patient has made a lesser inspiratory effort. As a
consequence, the lung volumes have decreased. Borderline size of
the cardiac silhouette. No overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of
pneumonia or pleural effusions. Retrocardiac atelectasis. No
pneumothorax.
CT abd/pelv [**2183-3-17**]:  IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process.

2. Incompletely characterized 15 x 11 mm splenic hypodensity. In
the absence of a history of malignancy, incidental splenic
lesions are typically benign.

3. Pancreatic calcifications, some may be vascular, but raising
concern for chronic pancreatitis. No CT evidence of acute
pancreatitis.



Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo F h/o alzheimers dementia, COPD, Bipolar d/o presenting
with fever, tachycardia, and an elevated lactate.
.
Sepsis: With fever, tachycardia and elevated lactate and
possible PNA and cellulitis consistent with sepsis. Patient was
started on vancomycin and cefepime.  She was switched to
bactrim/doxycycline PO. Her blood pressure was low on night of
admission and received a total of 8 liters of IVFs over
approximately 16 hours. Her blood pressure then normalized after
this intervention. Patient was called out of the MICU within 24
hours of admission. On arrival to the medicine floor, patient's
antibiotics were switched to augmentin/bactrim for cellulitis
and azithromycin for questionable atypical pneumonia.  Knowing
that patient had recent urinary tract infection, urine culture
results were obtained form [**Doctor First Name 1191**] which showed sensitivity to
nitrofurantoin, which patient had been treated with prior to
admission. AVSS throughout stay on medicine floor.
Her rash was not classic for cellulitis given the
vesiculo-pustular appearance and symmetry; it appeared more like
a contact dermatitis, although without known exposure. We
unroofed a vesicle and sent for HSV/VZV DFA which is pending at
time of discharge. Also would consider medium potency topical
steroid cream.
Patient will be continued on augmentin/bactrim x 5 more days and
azithromycin x 3 more days.
.
Goals of Care: ICU attending held discussion with HCP regarding
goals of care and it was decided that patient would not benefit
from escalation of care.  This included NO central line or
pressors.  Patient would likely benefit from DNH (do not
hospitalize) order.
.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Elevated at 1.7 from baseline near 1.0. After IVFs, patient
CR decreased to 1.5 and stabilized at 1.3.  PO fluid intake was
encouraged throughout the hospital stay.
.
COPD: Currently not on any inhalers, however has been in the
past, ordered combivent nebs prn.  Did not require any PRNs
while in house.
.
Dementia: Reportedly due to alzheimers and with recent
aggressive behavior. Continued donepezil 10 mg daily. Patient
did not require PRN medications and remained calm and oriented
throughout her stay on the medicine floor
.
Bipolar d/o: Recent medication adjustment at [**Hospital 1191**] Hospital.
Continued [**Hospital3 4107**] regimen of Seroquel 12.5 prn,
citalopram 20 mg daily, Divalproex and gabapentin as well.
Patient did not require any PRN medications for agitation while
on the medicine floor
.
Anemia: Stable. No transfusions in the MICU.  Remained stable on
emdicine floor
.
Splenic hypodensity: CT scan showed splenic hypondensity, given
history of malignancy, could be followed up with further
evaluation although may not be compatible w/ goals of care.
.
Code: DNR/DNI
.
Transitional issues - HSV/VZV DFA pending at time of discharge;
topical steroid cream not yet started
