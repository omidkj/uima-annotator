Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with a history of dementia who
presented with R sided weakness and falls. His brief hospital
course is as follows:
.
1. Falls, Subdural Hematoma. He was found to have bilateral
subdural hematoma at the OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
monitoring. He was initially admitted to the ICU. His neurologic
status declined and he was taken to the OR where under MAC
anesthesia he underwent left and right bilateral burr hole
evacuation for worsening mass effect from subdural hematomas. He
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the PACU
and then to neuro stepdown unit. He was followed with CT of head
which showed slightly less blood and less mass effect.
.
His post-operative course was complicated by poor recovery. He
showed some neurologic improvement 3 days post-op, opening his
eyes to command. However, he deteriorated again from that point,
becoming unresponsive on POD#5. He was transferred to medicine
at that point as there was no further indication for
neurosurgery: his Head CT was stable and he was no longer a
surgical candidate. Many discussions were held with his family
that culminated in the decision not to transfer him to the ICU
and to avoid any invasive maneuvers but to continue managing him
medically. His mental status waxed and waned slightly over the
next three days, but his peak functioning was to open his eyes
on command. Without evidence of significant progression and with
a poor overall prognosis even with optimal medical care, the
decision was made to change his status to comfort measures only
(CMO). This decision was made by his son in consultation with
the medical team; his son felt that he would not have wanted
further intervention. At this point, his NG tube was removed, no
further labs were checked, and the only medications administered
were those aimed at improving his immediate comfort. He
subsequently died comfortable.
.
2. Hypervolemia. On transfer from the Neurosurgery service to
the Medicine service, the primary assessment was a volume
overload impairing his respiratory status. He was consequently
diuresed with Lasix with good effect on his breathing, although
minimal effect on his mental status.
.
3. Hypernatremia. His sodium peaked at 150 after diuresis. This
improved with a small return of free water. Labs were no longer
followed after he was made CMO.
.
4. Nutritional status. Albumin 2.7. An NG tube was placed for
tube feeds. However, shortly after that, the family decided that
they definitely did not want him to receive a PEG tube and
instead would prefer to focus on comfort measures only.
.
5. UTI. Although there was some concern for infection and sepsis
at the time of transfer to Medicine, a urine culture positive
for pseudomonas was the only sign of a localizing infection. His
vitals were stable over the last several days. Therefore,
empiric antibiotic coverage was no longer indicated, and since
the pseudomonas in culture was sensitive to ciprofloxacin, he
was switched to this. Once the CMO status was established,
antibiotics were stopped. He received a total of three days of
Vancomycin and Zosyn and one day of Cipro.
.
6. Acute Renal Failure. This improved with diuresis and was
likely the result of decreased ECV. His labs were no longer
followed after CMO status was established.
.
7. DM2. He had reasonably good control with NPH and HISS.
Fingersticks were no longer checked after CMO status was
established.
.
8. HTN. His antihypertensive medications were held given
concerns of hypotension and an uncertain intracranial pressure.
.
9. Communication: His son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 70358**]) was the
primary contact and decision-maker.
.
10. CODE: CMO. This was discussed many times at length.
Ultimately, the family decided to have comfort measures only.
.
11. Dispo: Transferred to a long-term care facility close to his
home in [**Hospital1 1559**] for palliative end-of-life care.
