Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation
Bronchoscopy x2
Internal jugular central line placement
Swan Ganz catheter placement
PICC line placement, removal and replacement

History of Present Illness:
66F with morbid obesity, COPD on 2-3L at baseline, OSA, obesity
hypoventialtion, recurrent aspiration PNA initially presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with SOB and s/p fall and now transferred here in shock,
intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, with A flutter with
RVR.
.
Pt intubated prior to admission so history obtained mostly from
medical records and confirmation with sister. She had been
having SOB x2-3 days. Unclear if she had also been having cough
or fevers. [**3-26**] she had an unwitnessed fall with associated
dizziness and then called out to her [**Age over 90 **] y.o. mother whom she
lives with for help. She appeared to have hit her head though it
was unclear if she had LOC. She was brought to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by
EMS. Prior to arrival she was noted to be tachycardic to 150s
which was felt to be SVT. She received adenosine 6 mg then 12 mg
with little effect. In [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] she was started on dilt drip
and digoxin 0.5mg without effect. She was also quite dyspneic
and she was started on BiPAP. She clinically worsened and was
noted to be altered so she was intubated. Pt was a difficult
intubation d/t size, anatomy, was successfully tubed w/ 2nd
attempt. She also uncerwent head CT and C-spine CT for her fall
which were negative except for old C2 fracture and cervical
stenosis/DJD. Her pupils unequal in size, both reactive, R->3 to
2, L->5-3/4. Because of the unequal pupils her head CT was
repeated which again did not show ICH or mass effect. There was
also concern for PE so she received one dose of lovenox and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial VS were: Pulse: 150, RR: 24, BP: 142/75,
Rhythm: Atrial Fibrillation, O2Sat: 89, O2Flow: 100 fio2. Her
initial ABG was 7.32/51/72/27. Her lactate was normal and her
first set of troponins was normal. Cardiology performed a
limited bedside echo which showed small RV with good
contractility, no suggestion of PE per report from ED. She was
given Vanc/zosyn and admitted to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. HR150 BP 120/102. Shortly
after admission her BP dropped to systolic in 60s with HR
persistently 150s. EKG showed ventricular rate of 150, rhythm
appeared either sinus tach or flutter with 2:1 conduction. She
was given 6mg IV adenosine which slowed the vent rate and
demonstrated flutter waves.
She received 1L NS bolus and digoxin 0.25. Her blood pressure
repsoned well and slowly her HR decreased to 90-100s.
.
Of note she has been hospitalized twice ([**Month (only) 404**] then [**Month (only) 958**])
this year for falls complicated by hypoxia. The most recent time
she was treated with levo/flagyl for presumed aspiration PNA.
