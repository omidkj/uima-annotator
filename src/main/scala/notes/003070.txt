History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28983**] is a 65 year old man with a history of CLL and
pulmonary embolus. He has been off of treatment for his CLL
secondary to complications from the chemotherapy. He has
required frequent transfusions for his anemia (last transfusion
of 2 units of pRBC's on [**5-21**]). He is neutropenic and has been on
valacyclovir, pentamidine, and voriconazole.
.
He reports a dry cough starting about one month ago. Two weeks
ago he began having a cough slightly productive of whitish
sputum. The cough was at night and would occasionally wake him
up. He did not take any medication for the cough and it was not
made better or worse by anything that he noticed. At his
oncology appointment on [**5-21**] he reported worsening of this
cough. A chest xray showed a right sided infiltrate with concern
for a fungal process. He was started on Augmentin and
azithromycin. He felt febrile last evening, but did not have a
thermometer. He took Motrin and drove back from [**Location (un) **] to his
regular home. His temperature this AM was 98.7. By noon his
temperature was 102.5. He called his oncologist and was sent to
the ED for further evaluation and workup of his fevers.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 102.5 130 113/58 26 100 on 4L. He
was given a total of 2 L of normal saline and 1000 mg of
acetaminophen. His blood pressures were in the low 90's during
most of his stay in the ED. His respiratory rate increased to
the 30's, but improved after treatment with a nebulizer. His
heart rate improved to the 110's after fluids. He also received
100 mg of hydrocortisone. After discussion with the onc fellow,
the patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime. His
antifungal coverage was not increased.
.
Vital signs on transfer were: 102.8 98/43 112 22 99 on 4L.
Initially on presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he reported being
relatively comfortable, but tachypneic. Afterwards he developed
on ongoing cough that was improved with guafenesin and a
nebulizer. He stated that his breathing felt more comfortable
than yesterday.
.
Review of sytems:
Reports recent constipation, but now having regular bowel
movements. He reports having a few episodes at home where he
will not be able to get to the bathroom quick enough. He had
some incontinence of urine last night, but denied dysuria or
hematuria. He reports last night using the urinal and having a
bowel movement at the same time on the floor. He reports being
able to sense the bowel movement, but not being able to get to
the toilet quick enough. Reports little appetite over the last
day. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Oncology History:
SUMMARY OF CLL HISTORY:
1) He developed herpes zoster of the right cheek in [**2143**],
treated with Valtrex. In [**2143**], he had recurrence of a
cutaneous eruption involving the right cheek, but evaluation was
felt inconsistent with recurrent herpes zoster and biopsies
supported a clonal low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferation, perhaps
"marginal zone B-cell lymphoma," reviewed by dermatologist Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28984**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
(2) This right face cutaneous eruption waxed and waned in early
[**2144**], extending to involve the right nostril and skin to the
left of midline underneath the nose. In follow-up evaluation a
CBC showed leukocytosis (WBC = 22.7K), but differential was not
obtained. He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28984**] in follow-up who performed skin
lesional punch biopsy of the superior nasolabial crease on
[**2145-4-7**]. This showed skin involvement by CLL, without evidence of
transformation.
(3) Subsequently, he saw Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Company 2860**], and flow
cytometry of peripheral blood on [**2145-4-28**] confirmed a lymphocyte
predominance by CLL; 3% of cells were positive for CD38. On
[**2145-4-28**], torso CT scan at [**Hospital1 112**] showed extensive lymphadenopathy
at multiple sites throughout the upper neck, chest, abdomen and
pelvis, as summarized in my [**2146-2-25**] note.
(4) Repeat CBCs in [**5-11**] again showed leukocytosis with
lymphocyte
predominance on differential. He saw hematologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**]
for a second opinion. At [**Hospital1 18**], WBCs = 13.6 and 17.9K with 76%
and 66% lymphocytes on [**2145-5-26**] and [**2145-5-31**], respectively. Flow
cytometry at [**Hospital1 18**] again confirmed CLL; however, 50% of B cells
were CD38 positive.
(5) In [**5-11**], he developed fevers and constitutional symptoms
with
marked fatigue and weight loss. On evaluation by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
at [**Company 2860**], concern was raised regarding transformation of his CLL,
and repeat torso CT scan was obtained on [**2145-6-3**], showing
interval increase in some but not all areas of lymphadenopathy,
as summarized in my [**2146-2-25**] note. However, subsequent evaluation
by infectious disease specialist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**] at [**Hospital1 18**]
disclosed erlichiosis, and therapy with doxycycline was begun.
By
[**2146**], he had noted marked improvement in his constitutional
symptoms with resolution of fevers and stabilization of his
weight, having had a 15-pound weight loss during his summer
illness.
(6) In [**12-12**], he developed bilateral otitis media, worse on the
right, complicated by tympanic membrane perforation. Throughtout
[**Month (only) 404**] and [**2146-1-6**] he noted progressive DOE. He saw Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Company 2860**] on [**2146-1-13**] who noted 2 cm submandibular and
inguinal lymph nodes, in addition to small anterior and
posterior
cervical and bilateral axillary lymph nodes. Chest exam was
clear. WBC was now 60K, representing a tripling in WBC over 4
months. Peripheral blood FISH analysis on CLL cells was obtained
showing abnormalities for the D13S319 13q14.3 and P53 17p13.1
probes in 4/100 and 70/100 nuclei, respectively.
(7) In [**2-9**], he met pulmonologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2168**] and
cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**], who diagnosed and managed CHF. On
lasix, he felt improved shortness of breath. However, on [**2146-3-28**]
and [**2146-4-11**] he experienced "crashing" fevers and sweats. With
progressive dyspnea, he was found to have markedly increased
left
pleural effusion and posterior pericardial effusion with RV
collapse. Admitted to hospital on [**2146-4-27**], he ultimately
underwent placement of a pericardial window, with drainage of
left pleural and pericardial fluid, both showing CLL cells.
However, evaluation of pericardial tissue showed organizing
fibrinous material with entrapped mixed inflammatory cells,
including numerous small lymphocytes consistent with CLL cells.
However, there was no evidence of [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation or
otherwise, and CLL cells were regarded as "bystanders." The
overall findings were those of an "organizing pericarditis, the
cause of which is unclear." Of note, multiple specimens for
various infectious diseases (see OMR) were negative except for
[**Location (un) **] B4 and B5 antibodies which were "8" rather than "less
than 8."
(8) On [**2146-5-12**], he was admitted to hospital from [**6-2**] to [**2146-6-9**]
with progressive dyspnea related to worsening bilateral pleural
effusions. Left thorascopic pleural biospy and talc pleurodesis
were performed on [**2146-6-6**]. Pleural biopsy showed: "Extensive
granulation
