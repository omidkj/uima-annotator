CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old female
with a history of COPD requiring home oxygen.  EMS were
called this morning due to her increased dyspnea.  The
patient has been complaining of increasing dyspnea, cough
with productive sputum for the last three days with increased
frequency of home 02 use.  The patient was started on
Levofloxacin on [**2174-12-15**] by her primary care physician without
improvement in her symptoms.  Also complaining of mild
intermittent fevers and chills without nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea or abdominal pain.  She did have decreased po intake
per daughter who lives with her.  No change in status when
she went to bed last night.  This morning the patient awoke
and was markedly worse.  At that time EMS was called and they
found the patient to be tachycardic at 122 with a blood
pressure of 140/40 with an oxygen saturation of 85% on four
liters nasal cannula which improved to 100% on 100%
nonrebreather.

On arrival in the Emergency Room, the patient's blood
pressure was elevated.  She was tachycardic and mildly
tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 79% on room air and
99% on 100% nonrebreather.  She was diffusely wheezy on
auscultation.  She was given back to back nebulizer
treatments, briefly placed on BiPAP with no improvement in
her clinical status.  Thus she was intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  She received 1 gram of Ceftriaxone and
125 mg of Solu-Medrol.  She also received intermittent IV
boluses of normal saline for blood pressure support.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  COPD, on home 02.
2.  History of DVT treated in the past with Coumadin.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  History of pneumonia in [**2174-8-30**].
6.  History of tachyarrhythmia.
7.  Transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2173-12-31**] showed
ejection fraction of 70% with mild to moderate right
ventricular dilation, marked right atrial dilation with a PEA
pressure of 70, 2 to 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+ aortic
insufficiency and 1+ mitral regurgitation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Diltiazem extended released 120 mg po q day,
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day, calcitrol 0.25 mg tid, Protonix 40
mg po q day, home oxygen, Albuterol, potassium chloride 10
mEq po q day, prednisone 10 mg po q day.  It is not known if
this is part of a taper or if the patient is on this
chronically.  Calcium 500 mg po q day, Lasix 40 mg po q day,
Flovent 220 q day, Combivent two puffs [**Hospital1 **].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with husband and daughter,
denies recent tobacco use but does have a 25 to 30 year
history of remote tobacco use, reportedly heavy tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.0 F, pulse 96, blood
pressure 99/47, respiratory rate 15.  Vent settings:  AC
14/400/0.5.

Neurological:  The patient is intubated and sedated.  HEENT:
No icterus, no pallor.  Mucous membranes are moist, no
pharyngeal lesions or exudates.  Neck:  Supple, no
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, regular
rhythm, no rubs, gallops or murmurs, no jugular venous
distention, no peripheral edema.  Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to
auscultation with expiratory wheezes and decreased breath
sounds throughout.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended
with positive normal bowel sounds.  Extremities cool with 1+
dorsalis pedis radial pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 17.3,
hematocrit 48.4, platelets 354, 59% neutrophils, 20%
lymphocytes, 17% monocytes.  INR 0.9, PTT 26.7, sodium 137,
potassium 3.3, chloride 93, bicarbonate 35, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.6, glucose 168.  Blood gas upon presentation
prior to intubation was 6.99/198/109.  Post-intubation the
patient's blood gas was 7.34/71/229.  Urinalysis showed [**5-9**]
white blood cells with occasional bacteria and no epithelial
cells.

Chest x-ray showed patchy right middle lobe density.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 103 with nonspecific T wave
changes in V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was advised to the Intensive
Care Unit with initial vent settings of AC 16/400/40%/5 with
a peak inspiratory pressure of 37.5.  She was started on IV
Solu-Medrol, q six hour Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer
treatments, Ceftriaxone and Levaquin and was sedated with
Ativan while on the ventilator.  She remained hemodynamically
stable throughout hospitalization.  She was given maintenance
IV fluids.  Her Digoxin was continued.

On hospital day two the patient was switched to pressure
support which she tolerated well and on hospital day three
the patient was extubated.  She tolerated extubation well.
Per the patient's daughter, she gets very anxious and
claustrophobic relatively easily.  On several occasions
post-extubation the patient became acutely tachycardic,
mildly hypertensive and tachypneic without significant
changes in her oxygen saturation or in her arterial blood
gas.  She was placed on BiPAP briefly for two of these
episodes and was eventually treated with IV Ativan for
anxiety.  She did not require BiPAP support for greater than
24 hours prior to discharge.  She had a triple lumen catheter
as well as an arterial line in place during this
hospitalization.

Blood cultures, sputum cultures and urine cultures failed to
show any growth.  After extubation the patient was restarted
on her daily Diltiazem and Lasix at her prior outpatient
doses for blood pressure control.  At the time of discharge
and for the 24 hours prior, the patient was breathing
comfortably on a nasal cannula of 2 to 3 liters.  The patient
was also provided with DVT and GI prophylaxis while in the
Intensive Care Unit with subcutaneous Heparin and IV Pepcid.
Her arterial blood gas on the morning of [**2174-12-21**] was
7.42/66/97%. The patient is a chronic CO2 retainer.

Both antibiotics, Ceftriaxone and Levaquin, were started on
[**2174-12-18**].  The Levaquin is to be continued for at least 10
days.  The patient's arterial line and triple lumen catheter
were also both placed on [**2174-12-18**].  The patient was kept on a
regular insulin sliding scale, given that she was on a
significant dose of steroids.  She does not have a prior
history of diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable for transfer to
pulmonary rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Heparin 5000 units subcu q 12 hours.
2.  Pepcid 20 mg po bid.
3.  Albuterol nebulizers q 6 hours prn.

10. Lasix 40 mg po q day.
11. Diltiazem extended release 120 mg po q day.
12. Flovent 220 mcg two puffs [**Hospital1 **].

7.  History of tachyarrhythmia.
8.  Echocardiographic findings consistent with hyperdynamic
left ventricular function, mild to moderate right ventricular
dilation, marked right atrial dilation, elevated pulmonary
arterial pressures, 2 to 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+
aortic insufficiency and 1+ mitral regurgitation.

On the day of discharge, the patient's white blood cell count
