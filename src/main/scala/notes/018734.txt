Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered MS - found to have several ICH at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old right-handed man with multiple medical
problems including seizures, melanoma, afib on Coumadin and a
pacer. He was transferred this evening from [**Hospital3 19345**]. I contact[**Name (NI) **] the [**Hospital3 **] where he lives however
there was only limited documentation regarding the events
of this evening, therefore the majority of this history is from
the transfer records as the patient is unable to provide
details.

Per report, this evening he had "metal status changes"
howeverdetails of this are not available. He did not have a
history offalls. He was therefore transferred to an OSH. There
he was found to have multiple ICH, largest on the R parietal
region with a fluid level. His INN there was 3.6 and he was
given vitamin K and 2 units of FFP.

Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 79921**] for medical management of a L hip
fracture which occurred on [**7-24**] in the same rehab parking lot -
he was visiting his wife who was admitted after stroke. Since
his admission there he has been noted to have baseline dementia
and a history of intermittent delirium, especially at night
("looking for the shot gun" the night prior).

ROS: limited, but pt denies HA, dizziness, vision changes, N,
SOB or CP.

difficulty. Language is fluent with intact repetition and
comprehension. Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors.
Pt. was able to name high frequency objects. Unable to read (but
does not have his [**Location (un) 1131**] glasses). Speech was not dysarthric.

CN
I: not tested
II,III: unable to cooperate with formal VF testing; pupil
1.5-.1mm bilaterally, unable to visualize fundi due to myosis
III,IV,V: EOMI aside from decreased upgaze; no ptosis; R
esotropia; No nystagmus
V: sensation intact V1-V3 to LT
VII: L NLF flattening
VIII: decreased hearing to voice bilaterally
IX,X: palate elevates symmetrically, uvula midline
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: SCM/trapezeii 5-/5 bilaterally
XII: tongue protrudes midline, mild tongue atrophy

Motor: diffusely decreased bulk throughout; motor impersistence
and paratonia; pt does not sustain elevated arms long enough to
test pronator drift. Antigravity in arms and has 5- finger
flexion; the R leg is antigravity, but the left is not. He is
able to flex and extend without at the knee. Further testing
against resistence of the L leg was deferred given his recent
hip
fracture

TTE: The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

CT HEAD [**8-30**]: Multiple round, hyperattenuating supratentorial
lesions,
including one with hematocrit level, likely related to
anticoagulation.
Underlying hemorrhagic metastases cannot be excluded, and close
correlation with available clinical data is imperative; if
warranted, enhanced MRI could be obtained for further
characterization.


Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old RH man with melanoma and multiple
metastasis, an extensive PMH including afib on Coumadin,
seizures, and a pacemaker. He was transferred from an OSH after
an episode of altered
mental status at the OSH and found to have multiple ICH with no
history of trauma.  He was given FFP and vitamin K at the OSH to
reverse his INR.  Additionally, his labs were remarkable for a
significant anion gap of 21 and a leukocytosis with L shift. He
also has Pseudomonas UTI plus positive C.diff for which he was
started on Flagyl 2 days before admission.

His brain hemorrhages were attributed to be due to metastatic
melanoma.

He was admitted to ICU and underwent TTE which showed intact
LVEF but significant AS with area < 0.8cm2.

As for his Pseudomonas UTI, he was started on Zosyn and for his
Cdiff, he was maintained on contact precautions and treated with
PO vancomycin.

On HD #3, he was transferred to neurology floor.

head CT: No change in the appearance of multiple
intraparenchymal
hematomas.
The CTA demonstrates narrowing and irregularity of the distal
left vertebral
artery, the basilar artery, and the right middle cerebral
artery, with a
pattern that suggests atheromatous disease. There are no
vascular
abnormalities associated with the hematomas.

His family has decided to focus on comfort, no resuscitation
(DNR/DNI) and their priority now is to facilitate his return to
[**Hospital3 **] where his wife is also a patient.  Son is HCP and
is in the [**Hospital3 **] area today.
