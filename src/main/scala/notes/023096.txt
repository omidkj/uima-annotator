History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 31169**] is a 71 y/o man with PMH notable for PSC
complicated by cirrhosis with known gastric varices who
presented to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED earlier this evening with diarrhea
and maroon stools after taking a laxative earlier today. He also
reported vomiting "cranberry juice" earlier today as well. He
reported no chest pain, difficulty breathing, or abdominal pain.
Of note, recent EGD (last admission, done [**12-28**]) demonstrated
esophageal varices and amotility of the esophagus.
.
In the [**Location (un) 620**] ED, vitals were HR 60, BP 70/40, RR 12. He
received 4 L NS. He was found to have a hct down to 29.1 (35.1
on [**12-31**]). His INR is 2.1. He also had a potassium of 6 (not
hemolyzed) which was treated with calcium gluconate, kayexalate.
He received 40 mg omeprazole IV X 1. He was transfused with 1 U
PRBCs prior to transfer. Repeat BP prior transfer not
documented. In the ambulance, the patient's blood pressure is
documented as 77/46 and then up to 160/133 (?). His FSBS was
110.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is without complaint. He
denies any nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, or abdominal pain. He
denies any dizziness or lightheadedness. He had a frankly
melenotic stool on arrival to the ICU and BPs down to the 70s.
Attempted to place arterial line but unsucessful. Contact[**Name (NI) **]
Liver team to evaluate for EGD tonight given likelihood of
variceal bleeding.

Studies:
Echo: [**1-4**] The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears depressed
(ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis (and
dyssynchrony) of the interventricular septum. The right
ventricular cavity is small (extrinsic compression cannot be
ruled out). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
US abd: Moderate ascites.
.
CXR: Lungs low in volume, aside from small region of atelectasis
at the left base, clear. Probable small pleural effusions. Upper
lungs clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette unremarkable. Right upper quadrant
drains noted. No pneumothorax.
.
Para US guided: PFI: Uneventful ultrasound-guided paracentesis.
Approximately 3 liters were removed. Samples were sent for
laboratory analysis as ordered by the referring team.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known
esophageal varices and multiple epidoses of UGIB and banding
this admission, polymicrobial SBP, now with recurrent UGIB.
.
# GI bleed: During his initial presentation, he had a large
amount of melena and vomitted "cranberry juice" EGD performed on
arrival to the ICU demonstrated cherry red spots (stigmata of
recent bleeding). Two varices were banded during EGD. Bleeding
could have also been secondary to recent biopsy. Treated with
octreotide and IV protonix. Transfused 1 U PTA, 2 U pRBC, 2 U
FFP. No evidence of bleeding after banding. Covered with Cipro
for SBP in setting of GI bleed. Biliary drain in place PTA,
significant drainage of ascites from around drain. Culture of
fluid from biliary drain grew polymicrobials but no polys making
infection less likely. Given uptrending WBC GI wants para to r/o
SBP. Given unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4394**] pockets of US to be done by IR this
afternoon. To check bili on ascites as well to check for leak
from biliary tree. IR evaluated billiary drain, said ok.
Continued to leak large amount of ascites from around the site.
Per GI and IR no other intervention for leak.  The patient was
transferred to the floor, but ultimately returned to the ICU
after a subsequent episode of UGIB.  At that time, it was
determined to reverse his DNR/DNI status and pursue endoscopy
which required intubation.  He was transfused an additional 3
units PRBC and 2 units FFP.  The patient was continued on PPI
and octreotide gtt.  It was apparent that the patient had
aspirated blood given it was suctioned from the ET tube after
intubation.  The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the decision was made
to make the patient DNR again, with comfort being the goal.
Mechanical ventilation was discontinued.
.
# Hypotension: Related to blood loss as above. Received a total
of 6 L NS (4 l at [**Location (un) 620**] and 2 L here on arrival) in addition
to total of 3 U prbcs. Arterial line placed by Liver team prior
to endoscopy with SBPs ~ [**11-8**] points higher than cuff
pressures.  The patient was maintained on pressor support on
transfer back to the MICU.  After discussion with the family,
and the patient was made comfort measures only, the pressors
were discontinued.
.
# SBP/Leukocytosis: Diagnosed [**2185-1-5**], patient was on Cipro ppx
as outpatient and recently increased dose due to variceal bleed.
Placed on Aztreonam [**2176**] mg IV Q8H 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] -
[**2185-1-10**]) due to Cipro resistance and pt's allergies. WBC count
kept rising, leading to repeat tap - SBP w GNR. Started on
Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] [**1-11**].  No other evidence of infection causing
leukocytosis, Cdiff negative, blood and urine cultures negative,
no PNA seen on CXR.  The patient was continued on vanco/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] to
cover for aspiration pna and peritonitis as well as caspofungin
for esophagitis and peritonitis with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
.
# Hypernatremia:  Consistent with poor PO intake.  Improved with
fluid challenge therefore most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
No flu
