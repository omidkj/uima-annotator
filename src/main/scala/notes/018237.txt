History of Present Illness:
HPI: This 77 year old male patient with non ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%, a fib (on warfarin at home),
DM, HL, prior CVA, s/p BiV ICD re-placement for VT 6 weeks
prior, who originally presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for
ICD firing.  Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Per OSH, family reports that after starting metolazone and lasix
(once 6 weeks ago and once last week),he developed several
shocks from AICD which he has never had before.  With firings,
has brief loss of consciousness lasting less than one minute.
He was noted to fall in the bathroom with injury to his right
knee and shoudler.  Was brought to [**Hospital3 417**] ([**6-6**]), where
he had several episodes of VT on presentation where his device
fired several times converting him to AV paced rhythm.  Blood
pressures were reportedly stable. However he did have 1 episode
on that admission where he became [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and had diffuculty
repiratory effort and was slow to recover.Pacer interrogation
demonstrated eight shocks delivered since [**2145-6-5**] due to VT with
rates from 180-250, fourteen VT since since [**2145-5-16**] treated with
ATP.  2 AT/AF episodes noted. Lidocaine bolus at 80mg IV
followed by gtt,  Given IV lopressor and 1L fluid bolus, and 2 g
magnesium sulfate.  Continues on PO amiodarone from recent
admission to hospital.  Per OSH records, echo with EF <20% and
global hypokinesis, mod MR/TR, mild pulm HTN.  Cardiac enzymes
negative times three.
.
Given diuretics and fluid alternating for few rounds with
diuretics finally held because of creatinine 2.1 and SBP in the

Final Report
INDICATION: Insertion of biventricular pacemaker, decline in
cognitive
function, cardiac arrest with subsequent intubation and frank
hemoptysis.
Supratherapeutic INR.

FINDINGS: Comparison made with a radiograph dated [**2145-6-8**] at
01.47 hours
(pre-cardiac arrest). There is new asymmetric opacity in the
right lung and
new bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities in both lungs
on a
background of moderate cardiomegaly. No rib fractures or
pneumothorax. An
endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been inserted since
the previous
radiograph and are in satisfactory positions. The positions of
the right
atrial, right ventricular and epicardial pacing wire are
satisfactory and
unchanged. Moderately severe bilateral glenohumeral subluxation
is
incidentally noted.
IMPRESSION: Alveolar and interstitial pulmonary edema, worse on
the right.
The diffuse ground-glass opacity in the right lung may be
attributable in part
to pulmonary hemorrhage, which would fit with the
