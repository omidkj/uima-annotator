Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2176-10-1**] - Minimally invasive mitral valve repair through a right
axillary thoracotomy with resection of posterior leaflet P2 and
mitral valve annuloplasty with a 32mm Future CG annuloplasty
ring.


History of Present Illness:
55 year old gentleman with a history of mitral valve
regurgitation followed by serial echocardiogram. His most recent
transesophageal echocardiogram showed a partially flail
posterior
leaflet (P3 and P2) with a highly eccentric, severe jet of MR.
There was evidence of a torn chordae of the posterior leaflet.
The ejection fraction was normal, there was no LV dilatation and
left atrial enlargement with normal PA pressures. Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6955**]
is
asymptomatic of his mitral valve disease. He has been referred
by
his cardiologist for minimally invasive mitral valve repair.
Cath
showed nl.cors and 4+ MR.

Pertinent Results:
[**2176-10-1**] ECHO
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe
mitral valve prolapse.( anterior leaflet - A2 portion ) There is
partial posterior mitral leaflet flail. (P2 and P3 portions)
Torn mitral chordae are present. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2176-10-1**] at
900am.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is normal.
Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. It appears well
seated and there is mild mitral regurgitation seen in the
posteromedial commissure. The mean gradient across the mitral
valve is 5 mm Hg. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware of post bypass findings

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6955**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2176-10-1**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve regurgitation. He was taken to
the operating room where he underwent a minimally invasive
mitral valve repair. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next few hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. On postoperative day one, he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. On POD3 he had
a brief episode of NSVT in the setting of a large amount of
diuresis.  His electrolytes were repleted. He continued to be
monitored with no further ectopy. He continued on beta-blockers.
 His pain was controlled with motrin and hydromorphone.  He
continued to make steady progress and was discharged to home
with his wife and [**Name (NI) 269**].
