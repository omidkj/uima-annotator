Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Called by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Neurosurgery to evaluate for
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old right-handed woman who presentswith
headache. She was in her USOH until Sunday (5 days prior) when
she developed a severe, acute onset, pounding headache. A
headache of any sort is unusual for her. This was associated
with some nausea but no vomiting and no other symptoms. She took
frequent Tylenol and went to bed early. There was some
improvement by the next day, and it had resolved within 24
hours. She did see her PCP on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she had a recurrence of this headache. Again a
sharp pain bifrontally maximal at onset that then spread to the
back of her neck and eventually became a severe pounding
throughout her head. Tylenol provided little relief. She had
nausea, but no other symptoms, including no frank vertigo or
disequilibrium, no focal weakness, no dysphagia, no diplopia.
When the headache persisted through the next day, she called her
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] referred her to the [**Hospital3 417**] ED. There, a head CT
revealed an intracerebral hemorrhage in near the cerebellar
vermis, 1 cm in diameter. As her INR was elevated due to her
Coumadin, she was given 2 units of FFP there. She was then
transferred here.

After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], her INR was 2.0. She was given 2 more
units of FFP and 10 mg of SQ Vitamin K. She was admitted to the
neurosurgical service, but as there is no surgical intervention
warranted, they have consulted us for further recommendations on
management and for possible transfer to our service.

On neuro ROS, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] headache now, as well as loss of
vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia,
lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**]
difficulties producing or comprehending speech.  [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**] focal
weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**] difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, she [**Last Name (Titles) **] recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**] cough,
shortness of breath.  [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**] chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**] nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
 No dysuria.  [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**] arthralgias or myalgias. [**Last Name (Titles) 4273**] rash.

Laboratory Data:

Ca: 9.7 Mg: 2.2 P: 2.7

WBC: 7.9; Hct: 30.7; Plt: 237

PT: 16.0  PTT: 29.0  INR: 1.4

EKG: Paced

Radiologic Data:
NCHCT: Small, 11 mm hyperdense lesion in the superior
cerebellum adjacent to the tentorium in the midline. This should
be a very
unusual location for isolated subdural hemorrhage. As this
lesion
appears extra-axial, it most likely represents a mass lesion
such
as meningioma. Less likely consideration would be a metastatic
focus. MRI may be helpful for further characterization.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a small region of
hypodensity in the vermis adjacent to this lesion. This may
represent edema, which would argue for an intra axial
abnormality. I agree with the recommendation of an MR exam, but
I
raise the possibility that this may reflect an intra axial
lesion, perhaps hemorrhage. Unfortunately, I do not have access
to the outside study, so I cannot comment about any changes
since
the prior study.

REPEAT HEAD CT w/wo CONTRAST: In comparison to the non-contrast
head CT, there is no definite change in size of a
well-circumscribed focal hyperdensity in the superior aspect of
the cerebellum measuring 14 x 7 mm. The difference in
measurements are within the possible difference due to slice
selection. There is a small region of hypodensity in the vermis
adjacent to this lesion, which likely represents a small amount
of edema. Therefore, an intra-axial location is likely. This
lesion does not demonstrate enhancement on contrast-enhanced
imaging, and the density is unchanged on delayed images.
Therefore, a small focus of hemorrhage is the likely etiology.

EKG: A-V sequential paced rhythm. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2146-11-23**] there is no significant diagnostic change.

CXR [**6-21**] Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and there is
persistent pulmonary vascular engorgement. Bilateral diffuse
interstitial opacities have improved, consistent with improving
interstitial edema. However, more confluent airspace opacities
in the lower lungs have slightly worsened, particularly in the
left lower lobe. Although possibly due to dependent areas of
edema, superimposed process such as a pneumonia should be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small right
pleural effusion has decreased in size, but a small-to-moderate
left effusion is slightly larger.

KUB [**2150-6-21**] Non-obstructed bowel gas pattern is visualized.
Surgical clips are noted within the pelvis. Examination was not
obtained in upright or lateral decubitus view; thus, free
intraperitoneal air cannot be assessed. Right hemidiaphragm is
moderately elevated.
