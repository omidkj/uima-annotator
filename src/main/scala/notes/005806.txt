Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5749**] is an 81F h/o dermatomyositis, HTN, dCHF, COPD presents
with SOB. Her daughter notes that she had developed a URI 2 days
ago w/ rhinorrhea and mild cough. She was sent from nursing home
for evaluation as today at 10am developed SOB and desats to the
70s. No documentation in chart from nursing home.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 99.6, 95, 160/85, 87% on NRB.
Exam with decreased bilat breath sounds with basilar rales. ABG
7.3/86/199. Labs notable for WBC 73 (no bands), K 2.8, lactate
2.4, CK 81, TnT 0.03. U/A negative. Blood cultures sent.
Initially thought CHF exacerbation. BiPAP, lasix 40mg, and nitro
gtt with good urine output response but decrease in SBP to 50s
that improved to 90s after nitro discontinued. Decadron 10mg IV
also given as on chronic prednisone. Review of CXR then did not
appear to be CHF but rather possible infiltrate consistent with
pneumonia so gave ceftriaxone 1g, vancomycin 1g, and
levofloxacin 750mg. Finally, they did not believe that the
pneumonia on CXR could explain her hypoxia, thus a CTA chest was
performed to r/o PE which showed no PE but multifocal PNA. After
some discussion, the family decided to reverse DNR status and
therefore she was intubated for respiratory distress and
hypercarbia, with post-intubation ABG 7.62/38/487
(550x18/5/1.0). Admit ICU.

Studies:
[**2111-12-1**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No displaced rib fracture. Right lower
hemithorax opacity with unusual configuration. Findings do not
suggest atelectasis. There may be a component of pleural
effusion, and if present, likely loculated. Recommend repeating
the study with PA, lateral and decubitus views, if patient can
tolerate.
.
[**2111-12-1**] CTA chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Left lower lobe consolidation, right upper lobe bronchiolar
pattern and
peribronchial opacity in the posterior segment of the right
upper lobe suggest multifocal aspiration or multifocal
pneumonia. Collapse right middle/lower lobes without obstructing
mass.
3. Main pulmonary artery enlargement, suggesting pulmonary
hypertension.
4. Aortic, mitral annulus, and coronary artery calcifications.
Aortic
valvular calcifications, of unknown hemodynamic significance.
.
[**2111-12-3**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic left ventricle with significant
diastolic dysfunction; mild aortic stenosis
.
[**2111-12-5**] CXR: Limited assessment of left lower lobe - left lower
lobe consolidation cannot be excluded. Bibasilar atelectasis.
Doubt CHF.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5749**] is an 81 F w/ pmh of dermatomyositis (on steroids), HTN,
AS (unknown valve area), presents w/ hypoxic, hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Initially thought to be secondary to
bilateral LL PNA seen on CT scan, and given
Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin in the ED, however the patient did
not have clinical evidence of pneumonia.  She did not have a
cough, leukocytosis, increased sputum production.  More likely
the etiology of the respiratory failure was multifactorial with
underlying low lung volumes from elevated hemidiaphragm, URI,
respiratory muscle weakness and +/- aspiration pneumonitis.  The
ICU team decided to hold antibiotics on [**12-2**] given negative
sputum and blood cx.  She was extubated after two days on the
ventilator without difficulty.  Her breathing has remained
stable since that time.  She was afebrile without cough or
sputum production.  The patient explicity reported that she does
not want to be reintubated.
.
# Dermatomyositis:  Diffuse muscle weakness contributing to
respiratory failure.  Most likely worsened by deconditioning.
She received decadron 10 mg IV X 1 in ED and was continued on
prednisone 15mg (home dose).  Both rheumatology and neurology
were consulted in house.  Aldolase level was checked which was
normal.  Both teams recommended intensive physical therapy but
no other changes in her regimen.  Neurology did not feel EMG
would be helpful with management.  Continue PPI given steroid
use.
.
# Left Hip Dislocation:  The patient does not have pain from her
hip dislocation that has probably been present for at least
months.  Attempted to get x-rays however the patient refused.
The patient refused ortho consult.  She was continued on calcium
and [**Month/Day (4) **] D and instructed to follow up with her primary care
doctor regarding this.  [**Month (only) 116**] benefit from bisphosphonate.
.
# Urinary tract infection: Positive UA with catheter in place.
Foley changed.  Urine culture pending at time of discharge.
Plan for 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin.  UA also notable for
large blood with no RBCs - this was attributed to underlying
dermatomyositis.
.
# Diastolic CHF:  The patient did not require diuresis.
Continued lisinopril, metoprolol initially at lower doses, but
eventually titrated up to home
