[**8-17**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Asymmetric pulmonary edema superimposed on severe,
bullous emphysema
.........
[**8-17**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Other than a more rapid rate, no diagnostic
change from the
previous tracing of [**2177-3-16**]. The tracing continues to show right
axis
deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in the
precordial leads,
and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
..........
[**8-20**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (anterior wall appears
slightly more
hypokinetic). The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2177-3-17**], the
overall LVEF has significantly decreased and the degree of
aortic stenosis
detected is now severe.
................
[**8-22**] CT Head
Today's examination is compared to the prior from [**2177-6-13**].
Again, there are small areas of periventricular white matter
hypoattenuation, which likely relates to chronic microvascular
ischemic changes. However, there is no evidence of an
intracranial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
is otherwise preserved. There is no midline shift, mass effect
or hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION: Chronic microvascular ischemic changes without
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. No midline
shift.
..........
[**8-23**] MRI
FINDINGS: The diffusion images demonstrate multiple small foci
of slow diffusion involving the left frontal and both
parietooccipital lobes. Small foci of slow diffusion are also
seen in both cerebellar hemispheres. Several of these foci are
also visualized on T2 and FLAIR images. Findings are indicative
of multiple acute small cortical and subcortical infarcts. There
is no mass effect or hydrocephalus. A small focus of low signal
on susceptibility-weighted images in the left corona radiata
basal ganglia region indicate a small area of chronic blood
products from previous hemorrhage. There is no hydrocephalus or
midline shift seen.

IMPRESSION: Multiple small areas of acute infarcts in both
cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres as described above. No mass
effect or hydrocephalus. Other changes as above


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
1.)Respiratory failure - Patient presented with SOB and
respiratory failure and was found to have PNA on CXR with
bilateral lower lobe opacities, as well as mild CHF,
superimposed on severe emphysema.  The patient was intubated and
ventilated.  Empiric antibiotics were started to cover community
acquired PNA and sepsis.  Once blood, urine, and sputum cultures
were obtained antibiotics were tailored appropriately.  Attempts
at weaning the patient were unsuccessful.  The patient also had
severe AS and mild CHF contributing to the respiratory picture,
and she was gently hydrated in the setting of sepsis.
Albuterol, atrovent, and solumedrol were given for treatment of
COPD.  However, once the patient suffered a CVA (see below),
goals of care were reassessed and the patient was extubated,
became apneic, and passed away from respiratory distress.
.
2.)Sepsis - Patient was hypotensive and tachycardica.  Blood
cultures grew MRSA in [**3-3**] bottles.  GPC were found on gram stain
of the sputum, but nothing grew, and MRSA grew in the urine.
She was treated with broad spectum empiric antibiotics but
eventually tapered to vancomycin, as staph aureus was sensitive
to this.  Hypotension was also treated with gentle fluid boluses
in setting of AS.  There was a concern for endocarditis with her
valve, and a TTE was done that showed worsening AS and EF, but
no vegetations.  However, the suspicion for endocarditis
remained high, especially after her CVA that showed evidence of
multiple acute emboli.   The patient required pressors
throughout her hospital stay to maintain pressures.  Once it was
determined that recovery from CVA would be minimal, it was
decided to withdraw all artificial support and the patient
passed within one hour of extubating and removing pressors.
.
3.) R-sided paralysis - No evidence of ICH on CT, but MRI showed
multiple areas of acute infarct, thought to be d/t endocarditis
in the setting of a dilated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/t severe AS.  Neuro was
involved and made recommendations to start ASA, maintain
pressures 140-160, and obtain carotid U/S.  While these
maneuvers were attempted, it was difficult to maintain SBP in
setting of sepsis.  Ultimately it was decided that the multiple
new acute infarcts would be detremental to the patient's quality
of life, and that she would not wish to live in such a
compromised state, and pressors were withdrawn.
.
4.)ARF - Initially was prerenal, but evolution led to muddy
brown casts on sediment, suggestive of ATN, likely d/t
hypotension in setting of sepsis.  UOP markedly improved and Cr
normalized.
.
5.)CAD - CK and troponins elevated and peaked.  Elevated enzymes
represented demand ischemia in setting of critical AS,
infection, and hypotension.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiology saw the
patient and determined that cardiac cath was not indicated at
the time.
.
6.) Hyperglycemia - Insulin gtt with good control
.
7.) Thrombocytopenia- stabalized at 65, [**12-1**] normal.  HIT Ab was
negative.  Meds such as vancomycin and protonix were likely
contributors.
