vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16115**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left internal jugular central line placement

History of Present Illness:
 75-year-old male with history of stage IV NSCLC with metastases
to his brain and liver s/p craniotomy on
gemcitabine/carboplatin, brought in from [**Hospital3 **] for
lethargy. He has been on antibiotics since recent discharge from
[**Hospital1 18**] for lung abscess (cefepime, linezolid, and metronidazole).
 He was noticed to have increasing lethargy today, only able to
open his eyes and not speaking at all.  His wife notes that he
has been speaking less over the past few days and is no longer
tolerating PO antibiotics that he should be taking.  They were
held the day prior to admission.

He was previously admitted in mid-[**Month (only) 216**] after an outpatient CT
scan of his chest showed a large right lung abscess and a small
pulmonary embolism.  He had been started on anticoagulation, but
this was held due to occurence of hemotypsis.  Bronchoscopy was
performed but no drainage of the abscess was attempted due to
perceived high risk of seeding, and he was initiated on
broad-spectrum antibiotics for likely post-obstruction pneumonia
complicated by an empyema in the hopes they would keep the
infection at bay.  He was discharged on linezolid, cefepime, and
metronidazole due to a questionable drug rash from vancomycin.
Swallow evaluation was performed here and he was recommended for
thin liquids and regular consistency solids, safe to take whole
meds with water.   Cardiology was consulted for tachycardia of
multifactorial etiology and he continues on metoprol for rate
control.  Gemcitabine/carboplatin was started during this
hospitalization with the understanding that he is a borderline
candidate, complicated by fatigue, mild neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia, currently C1D20.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.3 103 101/68 16 100% 2L NC.
Central access was obtained due to difficult access and just in
case he gets sicker. Midline does not draw back.  CXR was
repeated and showed worsening effusion and consolidation in LLL,
with a cavitary mass in upper lung, as well as the known right
lung findings.  Though there was some volume overload, he was
only given 1L NS.  RUQ was tender on exam with ultrasound with
only hepatic masses, no cholecystitis.  Lactate of 7.2.  He was
given the dose of linezolid that he missed at rehab.  CT torso
w/contrast was not performed secondary to his renal failure
(creatinine of 2.8 from baseline 1.2-1.4)

On arrival to the MICU, he is barely responsive, opening his
eyes slowly after awakening from sleep.  He does not respond to
commands.

Increased
bronchial compression and invasion by right hilar adenopathy,
nearly occluding
right main bronchus contributing to increased right lung

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male with stage IV NSLC s/p craniotomy and
initiation of systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine/carboplatin
with recent hospitalization for empyema treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics, returning with altered mental status
and acute kidney injury.

# Altered mental status/sepsis: thought to represent a
recrudescence of his pulmonary infection that could not be
optimally treated with drainage.  Since he has been on
broad-spectrum antibiotics, it seems less likely that other
sources of infection would be causing this new clinical state
(i.e. CNS, GU, blood cultures), so it does not seem worthwhile
to [**Male First Name (un) **] other sources at this time.  Also, this would indicate
highly-resistant organisms elsewhere.  It is more likely that
these antibiotics are not penetrating his empyema and his new
leukocytosis with a small bandemia may be a reaction to this.
He does fulfill SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, tachycardia,
and mild hypothermia so we can classify this as sepsis, given
our presumed pulmonary source (BPs stable).  Unclear at this
time what might be contributing to an elevated lactate, but
should consider bowel ischemia in addition to impaired breakdown
of lactate due to declining liver function.  Neurosurgery was
contact[**Name (NI) **] about his new SDH and they believed that this was
age-appropriate and likely not contributing to this picture.
Uremia should also be considered in his altered mental status.
He was continued on linezolid, cefepime, and metronidazole by IV
(not reliable enough to take POs) for coverage of his lung
abscess, as per prior to this admission.  He was started on IV
fluids without any real improvement in his kidney function,
despite low CVPs ([**3-5**]). Blood, urine, and PICC tip (pulled on
admission) cultures did not show any growth.  No further
invasive studies were performed (i.e. LP and paracentesis).  TSH
slightly elevated with borderline low free T4, but CT chest
showed worsening lung parenchyma and the decision was made to
hold off on further treatments until palliative care and
transition to hospice was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the
Oncology team on transfer.  Prior to transfer from the ICU to
floor, the patient's mental status had not improved over the
hospitalization, only grunting occasionally and not engaging in
any meaningful conversation, unable to follow commands.

# Acute kidney injury with anion gap metabolic acidosis:
Creatinine has been on the rise, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] records, with
last creatinine of 2.2 on the day prior to admission.
