History of Present Illness:
54 year-old Spanish speaking female with a history of HTN who
was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with a leukocytosis of 194K
concerning for acute leukemia.
.
The patient reports 1 week of fevers, sore throat, nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain. She also endorsed body aches,
headache, dizziness, nightsweats and SOB. She presented to
[**Hospital3 **] ED and was diagnosed with pharyngitis and given
antibiotics & pain meds and d/c'd home. She continued to feel
ill and presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. There she was noted to
have a WBC count of 194K. Her potassium was 1.6 and she reportly
had runs of monomorphic narrow complex tachycardia at rates ~250
that lasted less then 10s. She was given 150mg IV amiodarone
bolus. She had a fever to 103 so was started on zosyn
empirically. She had a positive d-dimer and was started on a
heparin gtt. A right IJ CVL was placed. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial VS: Tm:102, HR:120, BP:120/75, RR:20,
95% 5L NC. Labs were remarkable for WBC 185 with 83% blasts, Hct
32.6, Plt 103, K 2.8, Ca 8.3, Phos 2.3, uric acid 5.9, LDH 1052,
and fibrinogen 319. The heparin gtt was stopped. Bedside U/S
showed a grossly enlarged spleen. Peripheral smear showed large
amount of blasts. She underwent a bone marrow biopsy in the ED
and was started on hydroxyurea. She was given 1g vancomycin and
1 set of BCx were sent. Additionally, her trop came back 0.28
with flat CK. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU.

PATHOLOGY:
[**2179-2-8**] Bone Marrow Biopsy:
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for
evaluation. It consists of several hypercellular spicules. The
vast majority of the marrow cellularity is comprised of blasts
and promonocytes morphologically similar to those described
above. Maturing erythroid and myeloid precursors are rare.
Megakaryocytes are present in markedly decreased numbers. Based
on a 500 cell Differential: 91% Blasts and Promonocytes, <1%
Promyelocytes, <1% Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, 1%
Bands/Neutrophils, 1% Lymphocytes, 2% Erythroid, 5% Monocytes.
.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate
for evaluation, and consists of fragmented trabecular bone,
which appears osteopenic. The marrow cellularity is 80-90% and
comprised mainly of sheets of large cells with abundant
cytoplasm, vesicular and folded nuclei, and prominent nucleoli.
Maturing erythroid and myeloid precursors are markedly
decreased. Megakaryocytes are rare. Marrow clot section is
similar to the biopsy.
.
Cytogenetics: No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified
in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen. This
normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable
using the standard methods employed.
Note: FISH was performed on a concurrent sample of neoplastic
blood assessing for rearrangements of 15;17, 8;21, and 16q22.
All results were normal.
.
[**2179-2-8**] Peripheral Blood Flow Cytometry: Three color gating is
performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast and
lymphocyte yield. B cells com
