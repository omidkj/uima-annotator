CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old
woman with Type 1 diabetes, hypertension and chronic renal
insufficiency who presented with shortness of breath times
four days.  The patient reports that she awoke from sleep
with shortness of breath, orthopnea which has been getting
progressively worse.  At baseline she has some dyspnea on
exertion with mild to moderate exertion.  It occurs with one
flight of stairs.  She now is complaining of shortness of
breath at rest.  She reports she also is having increasing
lower extremity edema for the last several weeks which had
responded to increasing doses of Lasix orally, initially 40
mg p.o. b.i.d., then 60 mg p.o. b.i.d., however, this was no
longer helping.  She was also complaining of fatigue and
several weeks of difficulty sleeping secondary to orthopnea.
She denies chest pain, cough, fever and chills.  She has had
no other change in medications recently, no change in her
diet, no history of coronary artery disease.  The patient
reports decreasing urine output for over the last four days.
No hematuria or dysuria.  No calf pain and no upper
respiratory symptoms.  In the Emergency Department the
patient was noted to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation in
the mid 80s on room air.  She was 94% on 100% nonrebreather.
Her chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
She was given Lasix 100 mg intravenously with clear urine
output around 280 cc and no change in symptoms.  She was also
found to have a hematocrit of 22.  Her baseline is about 28,
however, she had no recent evidence of bleeding.  The patient
was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for treatment
of her congestive heart failure and acute renal failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 1 diabetes times 40 years
complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy,
hypertension, depression, chronic renal insufficiency with
baseline creatinine around 4.8, history of diabetic
ketoacidosis as a child, however, no recent episodes.  Denies
history of coronary artery disease, history of chronic anemia
with a baseline hematocrit of around 28 to 30, history of
carpal tunnel syndrome status post release in [**2155**], and
history of hospitalization in [**2159**] for hypotension and
hyperkalemia secondary to Atenolol and Capoten, history of
cervical polyp as well as a history of fibrocystic breast
disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her home medications include Lasix
60 mg p.o. b.i.d., Cardura 6 mg p.o. b.i.d., Niferex 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day, Insulin NPH 22 units
q. AM, 2 units q. PM and a regular insulin sliding scale.

ALLERGIES:  The patient reports having had reaction to
Capoten, Atenolol, Cozaar, Labetalol and Verapamil which have
all caused hypotension in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is single and lives in the [**Location (un) 86**] area
alone.  She does have a sister in the area.  She denies
tobacco, alcohol and intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  She has a mother with diabetes, hypertension
and myocardial infarction at age 65 and sister with
hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of
admission revealed her temperature was 98.6, pulse 103, blood
pressure not noted on her initial note.  Respirations are 25
and sating 92% on 100% nonrebreather.  Generally, she was in
moderate respiratory distress, speaking in full sentences.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, extraocular
movements were full.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive
to light, anicteric sclera, moist mucous membranes.  Neck was
supple with jugulovenous pressure of about 12 cm.
Cardiovascular examination, her heart was tachycardiac but
regular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.  Chest
examination showed she had diffuse inspiratory and expiratory
rales.  No wheezing, no dullness to percussion.  Abdomen was
soft, moderately distended, nontender with normoactive bowel
sounds.  Rectal examination, she was guaiac negative in the
Emergency Department.  Back, she had no cerebrovascular
accident tenderness.  Extremities, she had 2+ bilateral pedal
edema to the mid calf with warm feet, 1+ posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at the time of admission
revealed white count 7.1, hematocrit 22.8, platelets 288.
Coagulation screen was all within normal limits.  Her sodium
was 138, potassium 4.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 17, BUN 65,
creatinine 4.8 and glucose was over 400.  Anion gap was 16.
Urinalysis, urine was clear, specific gravity of 1.010, small
blood, negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites, 100
protein, 500 glucose and no ketones.  Initial CK was 344 with
an MB of 14 and index of 4.2.  Calcium was 6.6, potassium
4.7, phosphate 5.0, magnesium 2.3.  Chest x-ray is consistent
with pulmonary edema, borderline cardiomegaly and small right
pleural effusion.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia
at a rate of 105 with normal axis and intervals, no acute ST
changes or T wave inversions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by enzymes.  She was continued on 100%
nonrebreather.  She was diuresed with intravenous Lasix.  She
was transfused several units of blood for her anemia and iron
studies were sent.  It was felt that her anemia was
consistent with chronic disease most likely due to her renal
insufficiency.  She was seen by the Renal Service who
recommended starting Epogen as well as Calcium Carbonate.
She was continued on her home insulin regimen and covered by
a regular insulin sliding scale.  She was also seen by the
Heart Failure Service throughout the course of her admission.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service out on the floor on
[**2163-6-11**].  At that time she had significantly diuresed.
Her jugulovenous pressure was about 8 cm and her lung
examination was significant only for bibasilar rales.
However, her creatinine increased, eventually reaching a peak
of 7.0 at which time her Lasix was discontinued.  She had an
echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 65%, a
mildly dilated left atrium, normal valve.  Her phosphate
continued to remain high and she was also started on RenaGel.
Several days prior to discharge it was decided that the
patient would benefit from stress echocardiogram to assess
for any ischemia.  She exercised on a brisk protocol at 3.25
minutes.  Her heartrate maximum is 59%.  She stopped
secondary to inability to keep up with the treadmill.  There
were no ischemic electrocardiogram changes.  The
echocardiogram showed a small fixed anterior septal defect.
She had an ejection fraction of 44% and a moderate global
hypokinesis.  Her Metoprolol was increased to 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and her creatinine continued to come down.  On the day
of discharge she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and had an
arteriovenous fistula placed in her left upper extremity.
The procedure was uncomplicated and the patient was
discharged to home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  RenaGel 800 mg p.o. t.i.d.

4.  Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q. day
