with IPH.

She presented to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] [**12-5**] with right leg pain, numbness, and
coldness, found not to have distal pulse, and with occluded R
fem-AK [**Doctor Last Name **] graft.  She underwent RLE angiogram with TPA infusion
(3mg bolus then 1 mg/hr) and heparin 500 units/hr IA starting at
2:30 PM.  At 8:30 PM she was found to have L facial droop, L
hemiparesis, and was lethargic.  A CT head revealed a large
right
IPH (approximately 5.5cm x 2.5 cm x 4 cm) with 5mm midline
shift.
Heparin and TPA were discontinued.  She was intubated, received
lasix 20 mg IV, mannitol 60 g and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo F with hx COPD, HTN, HLD, PVD s/p R CFA to AK [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
with graft [**8-15**], found to have thrombosed graft at OSH and
receiving TPA and heparin drips, complicated by
large R IPH with 5mm midline shift, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation. Bleed likely due to aggressive
anticoagulation possibly contributed to by hypertension.

Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the neuro ICU under attending [**Doctor Last Name **]. A
repeat head CT the morning after admission on [**2152-12-6**]
demonstrated Evolving right frontotemporal parenchymal
hemorrhage with interventricular extension, similar in size and
distribution compared to most recent prior. With some Subfalcine
herniation with trapping of the left lateral ventricle, similar
compared to most recent prior, but new compared to study dated
[**2152-12-5**]. Patient was kept with -HOB > 30 -SBP < 160. She
received mannitol at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] and in TSICU, switched to 3% NS once
CVL (0.5ml/kg/hr w/ q6h serum osmol and Na checks -- hold for
osmol >320 and Na >155) A follow up head CT on [**12-7**] demonstrated
the right parenchymal hemorrhage, slightly larger compared to
prior.
QUALITY OF CARE:On [**2152-12-7**] two family meetings were held and
family made patient DNR/I with poor prognosis. They held off on
any interventions and patient was made CMO.  And passed on
