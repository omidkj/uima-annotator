REPORTS AND STUDIES
[**2168-2-12**] CXR: New interstitial edema, worsening LLL atelectasis
and adjacent effusion.
[**2168-2-12**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process.
[**2168-2-12**] Abd U/S w/ dopplers: Patent TIPS with no significant
change in velocities when compared to [**2167-12-18**].  Small amount of
ascites, right pleural effusion.

[**2168-2-13**] CXR: emlarged heart. Increased interstitial markings
throughout both lungs likely due to CHF.
[**2168-2-15**] CXR: Slight reduction in size of the cardiac silhouette.
Unchanged signs of interstitial fluid overload.  No pneumonia
[**2168-2-16**] CXR: Markedly improved pulm edema. emphysema. Bibasilar
atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions improved
[**2168-2-20**] CXR:  Persistent pulm vascular congestion. Unchanged left
basilar atelectasis/consolidation and small left effusion.

[**2168-2-16**] EGD for feeding tube placement: No varices.normal
esophagus, stomach and duodenum.

[**2168-2-17**] Nasointestinal tube:  Nasojejunal tube placement under
fluoroscopic guidance as described.  The tube is ready for use.
Covered TIPS stent in place following previous TIPS procedure.

[**2168-2-17**] KUB: Despite lack of evidence for SBO, lack of contrast
passage into the more distal small bowel represents slow
emptying.  This may indicate mech or functional (e.g.
med-induced) obstruction.

[**2168-2-23**] Limited abdominal ultrasound:
FINDINGS:  Grayscale and color ultrasound imaging of the abdomen
reveals no significant ascites; however, there is a
peri-incisional fluid collection, which has an inverted
T-shaped, occurring alongside the vertically oriented incision
but widening at its base, to extend approximately 10 cm in width
at the caudal aspect of the incision.  It is approximately 2 cm
deep, and there does not appear to be extension to the abdominal
cavity.  The underlying rectus muscles appear intact.
IMPRESSION:  Subcutaneous, peri-incisional fluid collection as
described.

[**2168-3-1**] CTA HEAD FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage,
midline shift, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular
territorial infarction.  With the administration of intravenous
