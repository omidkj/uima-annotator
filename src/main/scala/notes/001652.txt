[**6-17**] Renal U/S
TECHNIQUE: Son[**Name (NI) 493**] ultrasound was performed at the bedside.
Limited imaging, two images, were obtained due to patient
combative state.

FINDINGS: Only two transverse views of the right kidney were
obtained due to patient's combative state. The submitted views
demonstrate no evidence for hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
.
[**6-13**] CXR
CHEST, SUPINE AP: Comparison made to earlier on the same day.
There is a new endotracheal tube, terminating 4 cm above the
carina, beyond the thoracic inlet. A PICC line is unchanged. A
nasogastric tube has also been introduced. Its distal course is
not well delineated, but it appears to terminate near the
gastroesophageal junction. Advancement of the tube further into
the stomach is recommended.

The heart is enlarged. There is persistent congestive heart
failure and right basilar effusion. There are bibasilar
opacities, which may reflect atelectasis. The left costophrenic
angle is excluded.

IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory positioning of endotracheal tube.
2. Nasogastric tube appearing to terminate near the
gastroesophageal junction. Advancement into the stomach is
recommended.
3. Persistent congestive heart failure, right effusion and
non-specific bibasilar opacities.
.
[**6-22**] CXR
Since most recent film, there is improved aeration at both lung
bases with persistent left-sided pleural effusion. The right
costophrenic angle is not included on current radiograph.
Additionally, right infrahilar density appears stable and may
represent either superior segment atelectasis versus aspiration
in supine patient. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax, and tip of endotracheal
tube terminates approximately 7.5 cm from the carina in a
chin-up position. A right central venous catheter and orogastric
tube remain in stable position.

IMPRESSION:
1. Decreasing lower lobe atelectasis with persistent left-sided
pleural effusion and right infrahilar opacity that likely
represents atelectasis versus aspiration.
2. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 69 yo m with COPD, CRI, DM, pAfib, who
presented from rehab w/ SOB.  Hospital course complicated by:
.
# Toxic megacolon: Stool cx positive for cdiff.  Initially
treated with IV flagyl but it continued to get worse so po vanc
was added but this progressed to toxic megacolon.  Abd XR c/w
very dilated loops of lg intestine. Per surgery, would need
surgery for colectom/ostomy but per family mtg, he would not
want surgery.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: He was intubated for
hypercarbic resp failure after admission.  Likely
multifactorial, including COPD flare [**3-12**] ? PNA. Started on abx
at [**Hospital1 **] for presumptive nosocomial PNA and CAP. Also
recently finished a steroid taper on the day PTA. SOB may also
be complicated by element of CHF, given increased BNP. Baseline
O2 requirement 3L NC. Extubated on [**2179-6-16**] and tolerateding BiPAP
w/ CO2 in 80's which may be close to baseline but then was
re-intubated given rising CO2.  Continued on
nebs/solumedrol/vanc/zosyn/ but continued on vent until his
death with unsuccessful weaning, likely [**3-12**] volume overload from
renal failure.
.
# ARF on CKD: He progressed to ARF during his hospital course
and was anuric prior to his death.  Bladder pressure 28
indicating abd compartment syndrome. Likely a combination of
pre-renal azotemia +/- septic ATN +/- compartment syndrome.  He
progressed to hyperkalemia but per family wishes CVVHD was not
initiated.  Hyperkalemia likely was ultimately the proximal
cause of his death.
.
# Afib: Developed a-fib w/ RVR on [**6-16**] s/p extubation. Rate
controlled with diltiazem drip initially but continued to flip
in and out of RVR. EP followed and amio load and amio gtt
started. Pt unable to take PO beta-blocker. Per EP, held off on
starting dilt. Also, has been shocked several times when
hypotensive in afib/RVR and only briefly stays in sinus rhythm.

.
# CHF: With increased BNP from previou
