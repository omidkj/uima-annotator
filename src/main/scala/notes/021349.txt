Chief Complaint:
palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.

History of Present Illness:
83 yo female with history of HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV CKD, COPD,
dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple recent admissions for CHF last
discharged [**2187-10-23**] who developed palpitations while being
dialyzed and was found to be in rapid afib.  Patient does not
have a prior history of afib.  At dialysis, EKG revealed afib to
140.  She was given Cardizem bolus then gtt and her pressure
"tanked" to SBP 80-100.  She had an episode of hypotension
followed by nausea and vomiting, but denied CP, SOB, F or C.
She reported posterior neck pain but noted this was chronic and
related to positioning.  A left femoral central line was placed
in the field and she was started on neo.  Two peripherals, 24
and 20 were placed in her feet.
.
In the ED, vitals upon admission were 97.9 120 121/72 22 100%
2L.   She arrived from OSH off neo in rapid afib to 140 with
systolic bp over 100.  Cardiology consult was obtained and
recommended CCU admission with cardioversion.  V/S prior to
transfer: 100/61 148 97% on 3L.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo female with history of HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV CKD, COPD,
dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple recent admissions for CHF last
discharged [**2187-10-23**] who developed palpitations while being
dialyzed and was found to be in rapid afib.
.
# AFib w/RVR. Had hypotension (SBPs 80-100) after diltiazem
given in field. Unclear etiology of new onset Afib. Most likely
cause is worsening CHF with atrial distension. Spontaneously
converted to NSR and started on admiodarone with approx 5 gram
load (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week). Metoprolol was also increased to
100 mg daily. Will need to follow HR and decrease metoprolol as
needed as amiodarone load cont. CHADS score 3 so started on
warfarin at 5mg x 2 doses, [**Month (only) **] to 4mg on [**10-30**] and will
discharge on 3mg [**10-31**] and thereafter. Please follow INR closely
as amiodarone will cause higher INR on lower dose. Holding
albuterol to prevent tachycardia but may restart if pt becomes
wheezy now that she is rate controlled.
.
#Hypotension: Related to rate especially in setting of dCHF.
continued to be an issue during dialysis but treatment today was
tolerated well. Diltiazem caused briefly depressed BPs.
Transiently required pressor support. Now with SBP 93-115 on
metoprolol. Home dose of Lisinopril 5mg was not continued [**1-10**]
low blood pressure but should be considered in the setting of
CHF.
.
# Acute on chronic Diastolic Congestive heart failure: Recent
admission (DC [**10-23**]) for dCHF in setting of elevated BP and
flash pulm edema. DC at 53 KG though dry weight was 51KG she had
hypotension during dialysis so her dry weight was not achieved.
She is 49.0 KG at discharge and this should be considered her
new dry weight. Fluid management per dialysis. She is on long
acting beta blocker but no ACE inhibitor as noted above, this
should be considered.
.
#ESRD: on HD. Sevelamer d/c'ed as phosphorus low. Cont on
nephrocaps and calcitriol. Receives epogen in HD. Noted Vitamin
D deficiency in PMH but did not have supplement on her home
medicaton list. Vitamin D 25 Hydroxy is pending at discharge but
would suggest vitamin D as per nephrology.
.
#Hyperlipidemia: Cont atorvastatin
.
#Depression: Cont Venlafaxine
..
Transitional Issues:
#1 Pt will be discharged with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts event monitor and
will need to send transmissions to the [**Hospital1 18**] Holter Lab as
directed
#2 consider Vitamin D supplementation as per nephrology
#3 Follow heart rate and decrease metoprolol for low HR or BP
#4 check INR with labs on [**11-1**] and adjust warfarin dose,
continue frequent monitoring as amiodarone interaction can occur
late
#5 Please make primary care appt at discharge from
rehabilitation
