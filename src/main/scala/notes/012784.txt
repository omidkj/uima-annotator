HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
86-year-old gentlemen with a history of recurrent
pancreatitis secondary to gallstones, who transferred from
[**Hospital3 22439**] for further evaluation and treatment of a
new episode of pancreatitis.  The last episode was in [**Month (only) **] of
this year.  During this episode, he presented with worsening
epigastric pain.  During the previous episode in [**Month (only) **], MRI
was performed, which revealed acute pancreatitis, multiple
liver cysts, gallstones, bilateral pleural effusions, and a
4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The patient did
have a peak amylase of 7800 during this time, but the amylase
and lipase did return to normal values prior to discharge.
During this more recent episode, a CT scan was performed on
[**2154-8-13**], which revealed progression of the previous
pancreatitis with a new inflammatory mass, as well as a thick
area of pancreatic collection.

One radiopaque stone was seen in the gallbladder with
probable intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.  KUB:  Dilated
bowel loops suggestive of ileus.  The patient did not have
any elevations in amylase or lipase at [**Hospital3 **].
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2154-8-16**], where he presented with right
upper quadrant and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness.
He did have a bowel movement on the morning of admission.  He
denied any nausea, vomiting, or blood stools.  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] has
noted a 30 pound weight over the past several months, as well
as decreased PO intake.

shortness of breath, or cough.  He has also noted a 30-pound
weight loss.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Temperature 98.6, blood pressure 148/80, pulse 62,
respirations 16.  He is in no acute distress.  HEENT::
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Sclerae were anicteric.  HEART:  Heart was regular with no
appreciable murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  LUNGS:  Lungs were
clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds at
the left base.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended with mild
diffuse tenderness on the right.  He had hypoactive bowel
sounds.  RECTAL:  Examination was guaiac negative.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
WBC 14.7, with 86% neutrophils, hematocrit 27.8, platelet
count 247,000, BUN 25, creatinine 1.2, amylase 52, total
bilirubin 0.6, lipase 64, ALT 21, AST 28, LDH 215, alkaline
phosphatase 156, albumin 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was admitted for further
treatment and evaluation of the pancreatitis.  On admission,
he was give a trial of clear liquids, which he did not
tolerate.  He was subsequently placed on bowel rest and NPO.
Ampicillin and Flagyl were begun for coverage of possible GI
infection.  MRI revealed focal pancreatitis with marked
inflammation involving the pancreatic head and neck.  There
were no appreciable fluid collections that could be drained
at that time.  The MRI also revealed cholelithiasis without
choledocholithiasis, multiple liver cysts, bilateral pleural
effusions and ascites and no evidence of pancreatic or ductal
dilatation.

Chest x-ray was suggestive of possible left lower lobe
pneumonia and Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was subsequently started on Levaquin.
PIC line was placed so that Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] could receive total
parenteral nutrition.

On [**2154-8-23**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] complained of worsening abdominal
pain.  Noncontrast CT was performed at this time, which
revealed interval enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions
with associated atelectasis.  It also showed increase of
ascites.  There were unchanged low attenuation areas of the
liver.  There was worsening stranding around the pancreas,
which was consistent with pancreatitis.  Abdominal tenderness
did improve over the next several days.  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was kept
NPO with TPN supplementation.  Vitamin K was also added to
the TPN to increase INR of 1.8 to 2.  Ascitic fluid was
tapped, which revealed white blood cells of [**Pager number **], RBC 899 with
56% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, total protein 3.5, amylase
15, albumin 1.3, triglycerides 18.  Cultures of the fluid
revealed no growth.

Surgery consultation was obtained on [**2154-8-26**] due to
increased size of fluid collections/phlegmon/question of
pseudocyst, for further evaluation and management.
Triglycerides levels were checked in case TPN with fat was
causing elevation.  The value was found to be 69.

Echocardiogram was performed on [**2154-8-28**], which revealed
mildly dilated left atrium and severe left ventricular
hypokinesis, mild AR, and mild-to-moderate MR with an EF of
less than 20%.  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was tried on small amounts of oral
intake, not noted increasing abdominal pain immediately
afterwards.  He was then placed back NPO except for oral
medications.  Rectal tube was placed on [**2154-8-30**] to assist
in decompression of the abdomen.  On [**2154-9-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was
transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for hematocrit
of 26.5.  The abdominal distention was felt to be improving
and Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was again slowly advanced in diet.

On [**2154-9-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was noted to have some increasing
confusion.  Head CT was performed to rule out a stroke.  This
examination was negative.  On [**2154-9-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was
transferred to the Blue Surgery Service.  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was again
transfused for decreased hematocrit.  The mental status
progressively improved over the next several days.

On [**2154-9-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was noted to have tachypnea and
shortness of breath.  Chest x-ray revealed increased pleural
effusion.  This effusion responded to Lasix therapy and the
pulmonary status improved.  PO intake was encouraged.
Mr.  [**Known lastname 40378**] abdominal status improved.  TPN was cycled.

On [**2154-9-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was noted to have a temperature of
101.3 with respiratory rate in the 40s.  Blood cultures were
sent and chest x-ray revealed left pleural effusion versus
left lower lobe pneumonia.  Due to the poor pulmonary status,
Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.  In the ICU, the atrial fibrillation was controlled
with Digoxin and Tylenol.  He was diuresed with Lasix and
Diamox and he received aggressive pulmonary toilet.
Thoracentesis on the left was performed and 1200 cc fluid
were removed.  At this time, the bursa was also aspirated
with 5  cc fluid.  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was started on Ciprofloxacin and
elbow bursa and sputum cultures were followed.  Vancomycin
was added on [**2154-9-13**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 40378**] pulmonary status
improved with diuresis and he was unstable for transfer back
to the floor on [**2154-9-14**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was continued on TPN
for the next several days and encouraged to increase the oral
intake.  However, he was una
