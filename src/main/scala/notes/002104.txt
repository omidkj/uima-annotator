Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2184-8-31**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
left internal mammary to left anterior descending, and vein
grafts to obtuse marginal and posterior descending artery
[**2184-8-26**] Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This 83 year old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia was
recently seen in consultation for progressive dyspnea on
exertion. He is normally quite active and up until a few months
ago was able to walk [**3-17**] miles per day without difficulty.
Several months ago he began to notice progressive dyspnea. It is
now occurring with walking about a half a block. He denies any
past or current history of chest discomfort. Stress testing on
[**2184-8-9**] showed 2mm ST depression in the inferolateral leads.
Imaging revealed mild to moderate reversible defects in the LAD
and PDA territories. His LVEF was estimated at 36% with diffuse
hypokinesis. Based on the above results, he was admitted for
elective cardiac catheterization. Of note, prior to
catheterization, he received several days of Plavix in
anticipation of PCI.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Dyslipidemia
Prostate cancer, diagnosed approximately 10 years ago, s/p
radiation

years ago)
Left eye cataract
Surgery for a right undescended testicle as a child
Remote right knee injury

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68726**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization.
Left ventriculography revealed [**1-16**]+ mitral regurgitation and an
LVEF of 38% with severe inferior and anterior hypokinesis, and
apical dyskinesis. Coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system with 80% left main stenosis, 30% proximal LAD lesion, 30%
obtuse marginal stenosis and a totally occluded proximal right
coronary artery with excellent left to right collaterals. Given
coronary anatomy and possiblity of mitral intervention, cardiac
surgery was consulted and further preoperative evaluation was
performed. Plavix was discontinued. An echocardiogram showed
only mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic
insufficiency. The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened
and no aortic stenosis was present.  The mitral valve leaflets
were mildly thickened and there was no mitral valve prolapse.
The aortic root and ascending aorta were mildly dilated,
measuring 4.0 - 4.1 centimeters. The left ventricular cavity
size was normal and the overall left ventricular systolic
function was moderately depressed with global hypokinesis and
akinesis of the inferior wall. Right ventricular systolic
function was borderline normal. To further evaluate his
ascending aorta, a chest CT scan was obtained. This was notable
for the ascending aorta at upper limits of normal in size
measuring 3.7 centimeters. It also showed mild emphysema.
Further evaluation included dental consultation, pulmonary
function tests and carotid non-invasive studies which found no
significant disease of his internal carotid arteries. After
thorough evaluation and allowing the effect of Plavix to wear
off, he was eventually cleared for surgery. He remained pain
free on medical therapy which included intravenous Heparin for
his dyskinetic left ventricle.

On [**8-31**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting. Mitral intervention was not performed at time of
surgery as an intraoperative TEE showed only mild mitral
regurgitation. Surgery was otherwise uncomplicated. Following
surgery, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. For
further surgical details, please see separate dictated operative
note. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He maintained good hemodynamics and remained in a
normal sinus rhythm. His CSRU course was uneventful and he
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one. ACE inhibitor
added for low ejection fraction and beta blockade titrated. He
went into AFib and was treated with amiodarone.Pacing wires
removed on POD #3.His QTc was prolonged and repeat EKG done.
Cleared for discharge to home with VNA on POD #5. Pt. is to make
all follow up appts. as per discharge instructions.
