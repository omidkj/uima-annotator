Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Left subclavian central line placement


History of Present Illness:
62 yoF w/ h/o asthma, morbid obesity prior MRSA pneumonia
presents s/p fall. She has had 2 falls within the last week. 6
days prior to admission, she was unable to get up off the toilet
and fell forward on her knees. She required assistance to climb
to her feet. The day of admission, she again was unable to get
off the toilet, because her legs "felt numb" she fell forward
onto her elbows. No LOC, no associated CP, shortness of breath,
head trauma, palpitations. She presented to the ED and, given
concern expressed by family members that she was not receiving
apppropriate care at her current [**Hospital3 **] facilities, she
was admitted to the medical service for PT evaluation and
placement. Of note, she developed a cough, rhinorrhea, and sore
throat last week, at which time her PCP placed her on
levofloxacin. She was also started on Prednisone 10 mg PO daily
as she was unable to use her steroid inhaler adequately.
Currently, she reports bilateral shoulder pain with movement.
She also notes non-productive cough, chills last night (no
fever). Pt is very sedentary at baseline, walking with a walker
from one room of her apartment to another. Sleeps on 2 pillows
at night, no recent change. No PND.
.
ROS: No headache, myalgias, recent change in appetite, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain. (+) chronic diarrhea, no BRBPR/melena.

EKG: NSR 68 bpm. diffuse TWF, no sig change from prior
.
CXR [**1-3**]: Limited study. Stable cardiomegaly, mild/mod CHF
.
Head CT w/o contrast [**1-3**] : No acute intracranial process
.
Bilateral shoulder films [**1-3**]: Exam is limited by patient body
habitus. Mild to moderate degenerative change, including
marginal osteophyte formation is evident about the glenohumeral
joints, bilaterally. There is anatomic alignment of the humeral
head in the glenoid. The acromioclavicular joint is
unremarkable. Visualized lung and ribs are unremarkable
.
CXR [**1-8**] The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the
aortic knob. There is a left-sided central venous catheter with
the distal tip in the junction of the SVC and left
brachiocephalic vein, unchanged. The nasogastric tube is within
normal limits for placement. There are markedly low lung volumes
due to poor inspiratory effort. There is again seen opacity at
the left retrocardiac region, which has not significantly
changed since the previous. There is some mild prominence of the
pulmonary vasculature, also unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
A: 62 yoF w/ morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea,
restrictive lung disease presents s/p fall

P:
1) Recurrent falls: The patient had 2 falls within the week
prior to admission. These falls are most likely mechanical,
secondary to deconditioning in setting of morbid obesity. There
was no evidence of syncope/presyncope to suggest orthostatic,
vasovagal, or cardiogenic etiology. Plain films of shoulders
showed no fracture/dislocation. Physical and occupational
therapy were consulted, who recommended placement at a
rehabilitation facility.

2) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: On [**1-4**] a.m., the patient
was found to be hypoxic - 87% 2L NC, with diffuse wheezing,
congestion and non-productive cough. There was no improvement
with alb nebs/oxygen, or nasal BiPAP (ABG: 7.21/89/141). She was
transferred to MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She
was initially placed on BIPAP 15/5 with improvement in PCO2s to
62. However, ~ 30 minutes after it was discontinued, she became
more somnolent, with repeat PCO2 of 93. She was intubated on
[**1-4**] at 9 p.m and started on
vancomycin/levofloxacin/metronidazole for presumed aspiration.
MICU course notable for multiple temperature spikes attributed
to aspiration pneumonia for which abx were broadened to
ceftazidime/vancomycin [**1-9**].  She was extubated [**1-10**] without
complication. Her hypcarbic respiratory failure wasm most likely
secondary to aspiration pneumonia superimposed on underlying OSA
and obesity/hypoventilation syndrome.

a) aspiration pneumonia (MRSA): The patient was continued
ceftazidime/vancomycin for 14 day course (to complete [**2146-1-18**]).
Fiberoptic endoscopic swallowing evaluation [**1-11**] showed a
functional oral and pharyngeal swallow mechanism without
evidence for aspiration. The patient should be maintained on
strict aspiration precautions.

b) OSA: The patient will be continued nasal BIPAP 15/5 with 4L
NC from 8 pm to 8 am. Pulmonary service was consulted, who
recommended follow-up in sleep disorder clinic, and goal O2 sat
no higher than 92% during the day.

c) COPD: The patient carries this diagnosis, although PFTs [**6-22**]
more c/w restrictive physiology (nonoptimal study). She will
continue on flovent (to be changed to budesonide nebs on
discharge), albuterol/atrovent, and singulair.

2) Congestive heart failure: [**5-23**] TTE (suboptimal) showed a
presumed preserved EF. She was continued on an ACE inhibitor.
Her home dose of furosemide was resumed following transfer back
to the general medical floor. She was continued on a 1.5L fluid
restriction. Her weight should be monitored daily, to ensure
stability.

3) Hypotension: Following transfer to the MICU on [**1-4**], she was
noted to be hyp
