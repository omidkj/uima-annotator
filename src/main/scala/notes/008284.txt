Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for evaluation for CABG versus high-risk PCI.
angina for 4-6 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
OPCABG x3  [**2139-4-29**]  (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM to PDA)


History of Present Illness:
74 y/o with hx. DM2 on insulin, morbid obesity (380 lbs), PVD
s/p Rt. [**Name (NI) 6024**], CRI (unclear baseline but renal consultant at
[**Hospital 1514**] Hospital felt that her baseline was likely around 1.8
but Cr. now approx 2.4 down from peak of approx 3.6), emphysema,
who presented to [**Location (un) 11248**] [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-10**]
complaining of [**5-1**] weeks of exertional chest pain. She was found
to have bilateral DVT's and bilateral pulmonary emboli at that
time. She was heparinized. Her Troponin T was 0.11 at this time,
but rose to 0.91 - she was then noted to have recurrent chest
pain and inferior ST elevations with antrolateral reciprocal
changes. She was then given integrelin in addition to the
heparin and aspirin. She was transferred to [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital for
cath.
.
Cath [**2139-3-12**]: Lt. main: clean; Lt. Circ: 40-50% stenosis near
branch of OM2; LAD: subtotal occlusion near take-off of a diag
branch; RCA (dominant) focal 95% senosis at mid-vessel. POBA
completed with "moderate success" - 40% residual.
.
She subsequently demonstrated peak CK of [**2132**], and peak Troponin
of 234.
.
She was discharged to [**Hospital3 245**] Rehab from there [**3-26**]. She
continued to have difficulty with fluid management, and with
dyspnea. On the night of [**4-2**], she had recurrent CP alleviated
with SL NTG times two, she also complained of SOB, so she was
transfered back to [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital. She was felt to be in
congestive heart failure. Warfarin was held and she was given
heparin and integrelin again to "temporize" until transfer could
be arranged to tertiary care - she was also started on IABP on
[**2139-4-11**] due to hct drop to 24 (guaiac pos, felt to be due to
GIB associated with anticoagulation), relative hypotension and
decreased urine output; amiodarone gtt was also started because
of runs of atrial fibrillation and ventricular ectopy which made
synchronization with the IABP difficult.
.
Repeat c. cath was undertaken on [**2139-4-17**]: RCA site of
intervention appeared patent with a slight dissection at the
proximal portion of where angioplasty had been completed, but
this was not flow limiting at all. There was a tight, sub-total
occlusion of the mid LAD seen. It could not be crossed with
multiple attempts and wires. Her hct. rebounded to approx. 30
with transfusion, and at the time of transfer, her GIB seemed to
have resolved. She was additionally started on Dopamine for
"renal perfusion".
.
Prior to transfer the Heparin gtt was stopped due to falling
platelets and concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and
lepirudin was started instead. Her platelets were approx 100 at
the time of transfer.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain;
she endorses dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA; she has the hx. of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use, although she has hx. of this and resultant emphysema. There
is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 163/90 mm Hg while supine. Pulse was 73
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 14 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was obese and in no acute distress. The
patient was oriented to person, place and time. The patient's
mood and affect were appropriate.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple;
there was no JVD cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was
no thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft and
diffusely tender and slightly distended. The extremities had no
pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal,
femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin
and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers,
scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral- did not palpate due to IABP site
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 1+ Popliteal 1+ DP 1+ PT 1+
