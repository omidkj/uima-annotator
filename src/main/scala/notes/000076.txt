Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
increased lethargy, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1932**] is a 49-year-old right-handed man with a history of
[**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome with intractable epilepsy and
intellectual disability who presented as a transfer from [**Hospital 7912**] due to increased lethargy. The staff at his group
home reported that he had been very somnolent over the last few
days. They also reported a cough and some congestion and think
he might have had a fever. He has not had any increase over his
baseline seizure frequency (usually has 1-2 drop attacks per
day). On the morning of admission he was eating breakfast when
he reportedly fell forward and hit his head on the table:
unclear if he fell asleep or had a drop attack. There was no
evidence of convulsive activity. EMS was called and he was taken
to [**Hospital6 33**]. Upon arrival his vitals were within
normal limits (99.1F  77  102/65 16). He received aspirin 81mg
and 1L NS and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be somnolent and
inattentive, not answering questions appropriately and had
difficulty following commands.
Otherwise there were no focal neurologic deficits noted. ROS is
positive for recent cough/congestion, negative for headache,
chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, abdominal
pain, changes in bowel/bladder habits.

Past Medical History:
1. [**Location (un) 849**]-Gasteau syndrome; refractory seizure disorder with
baseline [**1-6**] seizures per day (drop attacks per group home
assistant, [**Male First Name (un) 17661**]) despite multiple AEDs and vagal nerve
stimulator. VNS was implanted in [**2187**]; staff swipes with magnet
on wrist after drop attacks. Followed in clinic by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

Imaging:
CHEST X-RAY ([**2200-3-4**]): As compared to the previous radiograph,
there are newly appeared bilateral parenchymal opacities. These
are better seen
on the lateral than on the frontal radiographs and are both
located in the lower lobes. The opacities are ill-defined and
show multiple air bronchograms as well as bronchocentric
predominance. In the appropriate clinical setting, the opacities
are highly suggestive for pneumonia.
.
CTA CHEST ([**2200-3-6**]):
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the distal left main
pulmonary artery and bilateral segmental and subsegmental
arterial branches. Mild contrast reflux into the IVC suggests
mild right heart strain.
2. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis, worse at the left lower lobe,
with superimposed pneumonia and/or aspiration.
3. 4 mm right minor fissure nodule, which may represent
inflammatory focus. No dedicated followup is required if there
are no higher risk factors such as malignancy.
4. Small left pleural effusion.
.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO ([**2200-3-7**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness
