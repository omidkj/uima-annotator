CTA chest - large bilateral pulmonary emboli

Echo:
  1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
  2. The right atrium is dilated. The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is severe global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. There are no masses/clots in the right
ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli:  On am of [**2122-8-29**] patient was
stabilized in the ED. Patient w/ persistent tachycardia, EKG
changes showing S1Q3T3, and CTA showing lg bilateral pulmonary
emboli.  Source likely from lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.  Was started on gentle fluid bolus for hypotension,
which quickly resolved.  Heparin gtt and coumadin were started
for anticoagulation.  ECHO done in ED showed RV global
hypokensis but no clot.  Decision was made not to start
thrombolytics due to vital sign stability.  He was monitored on
telemetry throughout his admission, displaying sinus rhythm with
occasional sinus tachycardia into the 130s in response to
minimal physical activity.  His BP remained stable throughout
admission; he did not experience chest pain, palpitations, or
other symptoms during his hospital stay.  He was given [**Male First Name (un) **] hose
to wear, which resolved his LE edema.  He was maintained on
heparin gtt and coumadin until INR climbed to >2, at which time
the heparin was DC and he was maintained on coumadin 5mg per
day.  He was evaluated by PT before DC, and was found to be
tachycardic on activity, but was able to climb a flight of
stairs without significant symptoms.  At DC, he has no symptoms
and his INR is therapeutic at 3.4.  He was DC with instructions
to follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 3 days for INR check and to
evaluate his hemodynamic function.  He will require repeat
echocardiogram in [**3-17**] weeks, along with workup for possible
hypercoagulable state when anticoagulation has been stabilized.

2.  Guiaic +stools:  he was found to have guaiac positive stools
on admission, likely [**1-12**] iron supplementation.  HCT remained
stable despite anticoagulation therapy during his
hospitalization.  He was DC with recommendation for follow-up
with PCP to check HCT and repeat colonoscopy in 1 year.

3. Crohn's dz:  he had no symptoms of Crohn's on admission, but
was on 10mg prednisone daily as part of a long-standing taper
for Crohn's flair since [**11-13**].  He was continued on his outpt
sulfasalazine and prednisone 10mg per day during his admission.
He was DC with sulfasalazine and prescription for slow
prednisone taper over 7 weeks, with follow-up with his PCP.

4. Anemia:  history of iron deficiency anemia, with stable HCT
on ferrous gluconate supplements during admission.
