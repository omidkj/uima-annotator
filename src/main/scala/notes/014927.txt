Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old Caucasian
male with a history of schizophrenia and aspiration
pneumonia, who was transferred from his nursing home with
hypoxic respiratory failure after a witnessed aspiration
event.  Per the nursing note, the patient choked on honey
thick [**Location (un) 2452**] food at lunch with moderate amounts of food
suctioned from his mouth.  The patient subsequently became
hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on a 100%
nonrebreather mask.  Patient's heart rate at that time was
154, and his blood pressure was 150/90.  He was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially
thought to be in CHF and was given Lasix 40 mg IV.  He then
was given Morphine 2 mg and started on a nitroglycerin drip.
His heart rate increased to the 180s and it was thought the
patient was in atrial fibrillation.  Diltiazem was given.
Patient then became hypotensive to a blood pressure of 70/65
and was intubated with plans for cardioversion.  The
patient's blood pressure subsequently increased to 122/65 and
cardioversion was aborted.  At this time, the MICU was called
for evaluation.  Also in the Emergency Department,
ceftriaxone and Flagyl were given for presumed aspiration
pneumonia.  Albuterol inhalers were given and sedation was
increased to a Versed drip.  The patient was then transferred
to the MICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. History of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Question of mitral valve regurgitation, echocardiogram in
[**2123**] revealed normal left ventricular function and no
evidence of valvular disease.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Prostate cancer status post TURP.
5. Schizophrenia.
6. Status post right total hip replacement.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Trihexyphenidyl one b.i.d.
5. Paroxetine 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Depakote ER 1000 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 537**] and is
dependent on staff for all activities of daily living and is
noted at times to be agitated.  The patient currently has a
corporate guardian who makes all of his medical decisions.
The patient's alcohol and tobacco history is unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.8, heart rate
120, blood pressure 88/52, respirations 24, and 100% on 100%
FIO2, pressure support of 20, PEEP of 10, tidal volumes
around 580 with a respiratory rate of 22.  General:
Intubated, sedated, and moving all four extremities.  HEENT:
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Jugular
venous pressure could not be assessed.  The patient has no
teeth.  Lungs:  Diffuse wheezing and rhonchi in the anterior
lung fields.  Heart:  Tachycardic, irregular, no murmurs, but
very suboptimal examination.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
nontender.  Extremities:  No evidence of edema, warm, and
well perfused.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cells 15.1, hematocrit 38.3,
platelets 226, MCV 89.  INR 1.2.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.3,
chloride 103, bicarb 30, BUN 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 133,
anion gap of 10.  CK 1012, MB 7, troponin less than 0.01.
Preintubation ABG:  7.44/45/105.  Post-intubation ABG:
7.27/57/110.

Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe atelectasis with a small left
effusion and possible CHF.

EKG:  MAT with a heart rate in the 140s to 150.  Q waves
evident in III and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE DURING MICU STAY:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  The etiology of the
patient's hypoxic respiratory failure was likely secondary to
his witnessed aspiration event, and the patient was intubated
in the Emergency Department and placed on clindamycin and
ceftriaxone for empiric coverage of his pneumonia.  The
patient was initiated on assist control ventilation, and was
eventually weaned to pressure support ventilation, and given
several spontaneous breathing trials.  The patient required
frequent suctioning during his initial days in the MICU.

In addition, the patient's abdomen was noted to be markedly
distended secondary to obstipation, and the patient was
disimpacted and maintained on an aggressive bowel regimen.
As the patient's abdominal distention resolved and his
secretions lessoned, his respiratory status improved.  The
patient self extubated on [**3-9**], and was immediately
placed on a high flow mask with a nasal cannula.  The patient
was continued on aggressive chest physical therapy and
suctioning, and did quite well after self extubation.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient's heart rate was noted to
convert to multifocal atrial tachycardia in the Emergency
Department in the setting of overdiuresis for presumed CHF.
The patient was started on a diltiazem drip and his
multifocal atrial tachycardia spontaneously resolved.
Several days later in the ICU, the patient's multifocal
atrial tachycardia resumed and was somewhat resistant to a
diltiazem drip, and eventually was controlled with a
beta-blocker.  The etiology of the patient's MAT was
considered likely related to his respiratory failure and it
is notable that the patient's MAT resolved with improvement
and resolution of his pulmonary disease.

The patient also was noted to be hypotensive on admission in
the Emergency Department in the setting of overdiuresis for
presumed CHF.  He became normotensive after aggressive fluid
resuscitation.  His blood pressure was monitored in the
Intensive Care Unit with an A line, and the patient was noted
to be normotensive throughout his stay in the Intensive Care
Unit.

3. Altered mental status:  The patient was noted on admission
to be minimally oriented and somewhat confused.  This was
considered likely secondary to the patient's underlying
schizophrenia as well as possibly related to his aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient was treated for his aspiration
pneumonia with ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  Once the patient
self extubated, he was agitated and abusive to staff members.
A Psychiatry consult was obtained and the Psychiatry consult
service felt that the patient was somewhat delirious,
although found it difficult to assess given the patient's
trouble communicating.

The patient was weaned off all sedation and was maintained on
valproic acid and paroxetine, his outpatient regimen.  His
mental status improved dramatically throughout the remainder
of his stay in the ICU.

4. FEN:  The patient was on tube feeds while intubated
through an OG tube, but once he was self extubated, a
nasogastric tube could not be placed.  A speech and swallow
evaluation was obtained, and patient did not demonstrate
clear signs or symptoms of aspiration at the bedside with an
adequate cough.  The speech and swallow consult service
recommended starting the patient on puree solids and thin
liquids with assistance with feedings and aspiration
precautions.  Patient's electrolytes remained normal
throughout the remainder of his stay in the ICU and he was
scheduled for a video swallow study after transfer to the
medicine floor.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course and discharge
medications, follow-up appointments will be dictated at a
later time on discharge from the hospital.
