Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s)

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A
catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the
RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. The IVC is dilated (>2.5cm)
Prominent Eustachian valve (normal variant).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. No thoracic aortic dissection.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**11-30**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.


PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). There
is systolic blunting of pulmonary vein flow, suggestive of
elevated LA pressure.

The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. A prominent thebesian valve is
noted. There is systolic reversal of hepatic vein flow,
suggestive of elevated RA pressure. The IVC is dilated with
spontaneous echo contrast noted.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed,
estimated LVEF=30-35 %. There is global hypokinesis with
regional wall motion abnormalities noted in the inferior,
inferoseptal and inferolateral segments.

No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There is occasional
intimal thickening noted in the descending aorta.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

There is a small pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB:
Left ventricular systolic function remains unchanged, estimated
EF 30-35%, with regional wall motion abnormality again noted in
the inferoseptal, inferior and inferolateral walls. There is
trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and hepatic [**Last Name (Titles) **] flow patterns have
normalized. There is no evidence of dissection. There is no
pericardial effusion.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
