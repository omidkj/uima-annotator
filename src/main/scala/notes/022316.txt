Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for cath for ST elevation, elevated
[**First Name3 (LF) **] concerning for STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization - [**2170-6-12**]

History of Present Illness:
65 yo female with PMH of CAD s/p DES to LAD in [**2167**], squamous
cell lung carcinoma s/p left lobectomy, chemo, and XRT,
complicated by laryngeal paralysis, COPD on 2L home O2,
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization.  Patient
originally presented to her PCP office with respiratory
distress, SOB, and chills.  PCP thought her to have a pneumonia
given her symptoms of fever, cough, and SOB, found that she was
having O2 saturation of less than 88%, and sent her to the
emergency room for possible pneumonia.  At the ED, she was
started on IV vanc/zosyn and steroids for pneumonia because of
fever to 101 and leukocytosis.  CXR with small amount CHF and
possible LLL consolidation.  She was initially treated with
lasix, IV Nitro but became hypotensive so nitro was stopped.
She was admitted to the ICU for poor respiratory status.  In the
ICU, they noted ST elevations on EKG in inferolateral leads, and
a troponin of 4.84 and 6.75.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac catheterization for concerns of STEMI.
.
Cardiac cath was performed which showed that her prior LAD stent
was patent, LCX with 50% proximal stenosis, and RCA with 50% mid
segment stenosis.  Also noted to have pulmonary hypertension.
Patient was subsequently transferred to the CCU for closer
monitoring given tenuous respiratory status.
.
On arrival, patient feels that she is short of breath.  Having
difficulty speaking full sentences.  Not having chest pain, no
pleuritic chest pain.  Overall feels very uncomfortable and
anxious.

Past Medical History:

- uterine fibroids
- laryngeal paralysis
- s/p partial hysterectomy

Social History:
Patient is married.  Quit tobacco in [**2159**], admits to occassional
alcohol use.  Has good family support.  Retired from [**Hospital1 **] where she used to work as a financial coordinator.

Family History:
father - CAD in 50s

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2170-6-12**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD was a large tortuous
vessel
with widely patent stent.  The LCX was a large tortuous vessel
with
proximal 50% stenosis.  The RCA was a large tortuous vessel with
50%
stenosis at the mid segment.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 12 mm Hg, elevated left sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP 29 mm Hg and PCWP 22 mm Hg.  There was pulmonary
artery
hypertension with PA  72/28 mm Hg, mean 43 mm Hg.  The cardiac
index was
2.2 l/min/m2 which gives a calculated PVR of 9 [**Doctor Last Name 6641**] units.
3. Careful pullback across the aortic valve revealed no
significant
gradient.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
3. Diastolic dysfunction with elevated left sided filling
pressures.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2170-6-12**] at 3:48:03 PM
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with extensive severe
hypokinesis to akinesis of the septum, anterior wall, distal
third of the left ventricle (including the apex). Ejection
fraction is difficult to assess in setting of marked tachycardia
but appears severely depressed (EF 25). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis and distal dyskinesis of the apex. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or stress-induced cardiomyopathy
(or focal myocarditis). Distal right ventricular dyskinesis.
Marked tachycardia. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Chest CT:
Lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and right hilum extending
along the
bronchovascular structures in the right lung could be reactive
due to
infection, but is concerning for neoplasm given the patient's
previous history of lung neoplasm and should be followed up with
repeat CT thorax in 2 months to ensure resolution.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo female with PMH of CAD s/p DES to LAD in [**2167**], squamous
cell lung carcinoma s/p left lobectomy, chemo, and XRT,
complicated by laryngeal paralysis, COPD on 2L home O2,
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization.
Transferred to CCU post-cath for poor respiratory status
.
#. Hypoxia- shortness of breath is likely multifactorial, a
combination of multifocal pneumonia superimposed on underlying
poor pulmonary reserve in setting of cancer with resection and
XRT with new development of acute systolic heart failure.
Patient has a history of largyngeal paralysis, making her more
likely to aspirate.  During her stay in the ICU she was found to
have a pneumonia.  She was covered for both CAP and aspiration
pneumonia with ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.
Discharged on Flagyl and Levofloxacin for total of 14 day
course. Spiriva and Advair were continued. CT of Chest report
read: PE was of concern given tachycardia and SOB, however
patient was ruled out with CTA. Lymphadenopathy in the
mediastinum and right hilum extending along the bronchovascular
structures in the right lung could be reactive due to infection,
but is concerning for neoplasm given the patient's previous
history of lung neoplasm and should be followed up with repeat
CT thorax in 2 months to ensure resolution.
.
Systolic and Diastolic congestive Heart Failure: EF 25%:
It is possible that her elevated [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] changes, and TTE
findings of apical hypokinesis represents stress induced
cardiomyopathy. It may have been caused by stress of pneumonia
on top of already compromised lungs. viral cardiomyopathy is
also a possiblility. Patient was diuresed with IV lasix with
improvement of respiratory symptoms. She also received scheduled
nebulizer treatments and had gradual resolution of her symptoms.
Her pneumonia was treated as above.

[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to LAD in [**2167**]. TTE at OSH showed LVEF of 30% which is
decreased from a reported 50% in [**2167**].  TTE on this admission
shows EF of 25% with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the
septum, anterior wall, distal third of the left ventricle. Given
these focal wall motion abnormalities she was taken to cath
which showed patent LAD stent with 50% prox LCx lesion and 50%
mid RCA lesion, and given these findings of non-flow limiting
CAD in the setting of focal wall motion abnormalities, the pt
was felt to
