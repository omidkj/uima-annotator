Imaging:
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2185-6-14**] 6:54
IMPRESSION:
1. Disc herniations from C5-C6 through C7-T1. Severe spinal
canal stenosis
with spinal cord compression at C5-6, and moderate spinal canal
stenosis with spinal cord deformation at C6-7. Evaluation for
spinal cord edema or
myelomalacia is limited by motion artifacts.
2. Globally narrow spinal canal from L3 through L5 due to short
pedicles.
This is further exacerbated by degenerative disease at L4-5
where there is
moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis with crowding of the
cauda equina.  An osteophyte arising from the right L4-5 facet
joint impinges the traversing right L5 nerve root in the
subarticular recess.
3. Moderate bilateral L4-5 neural foraminal narrowing and severe
bilateral
L5-S1 neural foraminal narrowing, with impingement of the
exiting L4 and L5 nerve roots, respectively.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2185-6-14**] 11:41 PM
FINDINGS:
There is mild cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion. There
is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. An external
line/tube is projecting over the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly and vascular congestion. No
pneumonia.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2185-6-15**] 2:52 PM
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common
femoral and
left-sided superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins were
evaluated. The calf veins demonstrated normal compressibility.
Remaining vessels
demonstrated normal flow, compressibility and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
