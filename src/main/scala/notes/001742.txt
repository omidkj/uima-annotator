Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, mental status changes, headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, lumbar puncture
lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
57 yo M with PMHX of nonischemic CM, CRI, anemia [**1-4**] plasma cell
dysplasia who presents today from OSH with fever and mental
status changes and transferred from OSH.
.
Unable to obtain hx from patient. History obtained from OSH
records and his girlfriend.
.
Per the girlfriend who is his HCP, yesterday at 9am he was
coherent and conversing normally. He became confused transiently
while going to the donut store and didn't remember the day of
the week. However, he was conversing normally. He then around
11am was in the bathroom and came out short of breath and in
abdominal pain, throwing up "coffee material". He was sitting on
a chair bent over secondary to pain. He also complainted of a
terrible headache and light was bothering him. He also had a
stomach ache at the same time. Her girlfriend waited for about
1/2 hour and then called the ambulance yesterday around 1pm and
he was taken to [**Location (un) **] ED.
.
At [**Location (un) **], his initial vitals were noted to be 101.0, 59,
157/71, 15, 98% on RA. His initial complaints to the OSH ED per
their records were abdominal pain [**7-12**] and vomiting with
questionable blood in vomit. Head CT was showed right
mastoiditis but no ICH. CXR showed multifocal PNA and slightly
increased effusions from [**3-10**], cardiomegaly. CT abdomen with
po/IV contrast showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, CHF.
Also showed an inflammatory process in left posterior pararenal
space with mild sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
His labs were remarkable for WBC 28.9 and BUN 40/cr 1.4 and BNP
1870. He also grew gram positive cocci [**3-6**] blood cultures -
alpha hemolytic strep. He was given ceftriaxone 2g IV x 1,
azithromycin 500 mg IV x 1, vancomycin 1g IV x 1, hydrocortisone
100 mg IV x 1. Ativan 1mg IV x 1 for agitation. and then
transferred here for further care.
.
Of note, he was d/c'd from [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2-21**] for new diagnoses of
nonischemic dilated CM and kappa light chain gammopathy/plasma
cell dyscrasia - monoclonal. He had a renal and BM bx this
admission which are pending, had a SPEP/UPEP, and flow cytometry
confirming these diagnoses and started on prednisone for concern
of a vasculitic process.

Past Medical History:
1. Nonischemic dilated CM - EF 47%
2. CRI
3. light chain gammopathy/plasma cell dyscrasia - monoclonal via
SPEP/UPEP - had renal bx/BM bx
4. Anemia with baseline hct 28
5. Alcohol abuse - while back
6. HTN
7. MVA with trauma to the right leg with back flap to right
anterior calf. Also with right radial artery to right leg. On
chronic narcotics including methadone and percocet
8. Hyperlipidemia


Social History:
No EtOH since [**2116**], but heavy use prior. No cigarettes.
Occasional cigars. Motorcycle driver. On disability s/p MVA. Had

worked in the iron industry and as a carpenter.


Family History:
Mother with CHF. No premature CAD/sudden death.

Physical Exam:
98.3,  101,  137/98,  16,  97% on 2LNC
GEN- lying in bed at 30 degrees extremely agitated, moving all 4
extremities, keeping eyes shut majority of time, not following
any commands
Neck - stiff but unclear if not cooperating and pushing back or
truly stiff
Chest- bilateral crackles R>L
Abd- soft, NT/ND, +BS
Ext- no edema, right leg skin grafts
Neuro - PERRL 3->2 mm, neck stiff, not following any commands,
moving all 4 extremities, withdrawing to pain, bilateral upgoing
toes, hard to assess reflexes as trying to kick physicians and
nurses
rectal - OSH - black, guiac positive

.
CXR showed multifocal PNA (LUL, RLL, ?RML) and slightly
increased effusions from [**3-10**], cardiomegaly.
.
EKG - LAD, sinus tachy @ 120, nl intervals, LVH,
.
CT abdomen with po/IV contrast showed bilateral lower lobe
infiltrates, CHF. Also showed an inflammatory process in left
posterior pararenal space with mild sigmoid diverticulosis
without diverticulitis. (of note, last CT at [**Hospital1 2177**] with pararenal
hematoma after biopsy, lung bases pneumonitis)
.
CT head at OSH: possible R mastoiditis, otherwise unremarkabel
awith no intracranial mass or hemorrhage

ABG - 7.55/32/79 at OSH on RA -> 7.51/34/73 few hrs later ->
7.55/29/69 this AM
.
UA large blood, 100 protein, neg nitrites/LE
.
Influenza test negative.
.
CK 5, Trop I 0.25 ((0.1-1.5 - borderline on OSH labs)
.
TTE:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis with inferior wall akinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is  severely
depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely  more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No aortic  regurgitation seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is  seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION:  Compared with the findings of the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2124-12-29**],  the LV function has decreased
substantially with now global hypokinesis with  inferior wall
akinesis. There is no echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis
 seen.

MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2125-3-16**] 6:24 PM

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN

Reason: Evaluate for mastoiditis, mass lesion, possible
vasculitis/a
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with possible mastoiditis, recently dx'd with
bacterial meningitis, continues to have mild confusion. Is
currently getting worked up at OSH for vasculitis.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for mastoiditis, mass lesion, possible
vasculitis/amyloid
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAM: MRI brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with possible mastoiditis with
bacterial meningitis continues to have mild confusion, for
further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before
gadolinium. T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained
following the administration of gadolinium. There are no prior
similar examinations for comparison.

FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow
diffusion to indicate acute infarct. There is evidence of slow
diffusion within the posterior portion of both lateral
ventricles as well as in the fourth ventricle and cisterna magna
indicative of cellular debris possibly related to meningitis.
Following gadolinium administration subtle meningeal enhancement
is seen. Meningeal enhancement is predominantly seen along the
superior aspect of the right petrous temporal bone. There are
soft tissue changes within the right mastoid air cells which
could be related to the history of mastoiditis. No evidence of
cerebritis is seen in the right temporal lobe or cerebellum.

There is moderate ventriculomegaly which indicates a
communicating hydrocephalus. No evidence of periventricular
edema is seen.

IMPRESSION:

1. Increased signal within the posterior portion of both lateral
ventricles, fourth ventricle and cisterna magna indicative of
cellular debris possibly related to history of meningitis. 2. No
ev
