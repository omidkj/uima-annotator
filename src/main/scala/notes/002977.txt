HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year old woman with
a history of end stage renal disease secondary to polycystic
kidney disease on hemodialysis, also with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, pneumonia,
congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recurrent
line sepsis, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 10377**]
Hospital to [**Hospital1 69**] for
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.

On arrival to the surgery floor, she was found to have a
blood pressure of around 60 to 80 over 30 to 50 with an
altered mental status.  She was then transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and
treatment.

The patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 10377**]
Hospital on [**2116-1-24**], from [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital **]
Hospital with suspicion of line sepsis.  She had been febrile
and had her permacath removed that same day. The catheter was
placed in her right groin and then her left groin
temporarily.  She then had a permacath placed in her left
subclavian on [**2116-2-7**].

Culture data showed coagulase negative Staphylococcus in
blood cultures from [**2116-1-11**], gram positive cocci in clusters
from [**2116-1-21**], in a blood culture, and Serratia marcescens
sensitive to Amikacin, Imipenem, Bactrim, and Levofloxacin
from a right femoral line on [**2116-2-1**], and finally coagulase
negative Staphylococcus on blood cultures from [**2116-2-6**].  She
was treated with Amikacin and Linezolid between [**2116-2-2**], and
[**2116-2-16**].

She was also seen by neurology for an altered mental status.
It was believed that her altered mental status was due to a
metabolic encephalopathy.  This was determined by an
electroencephalogram on [**2116-12-19**], and [**2116-1-24**], as well as a
magnetic resonance scan which was reportedly negative.
Because she was somnolent and had difficulty eating, it was
believed that she may be at serious risk for aspiration.
Gastroenterology consultation was obtained for percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement as her nutritional
status was poor as evidenced by an albumin of 1.8.  The
outside records document that she is DNI.

After being transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] Medial Intensive Care Unit, a left femoral arterial
line and right femoral central venous catheter were placed.
She was given approximately three liters of normal saline
which did not improve her hypotension or mental status.  She
was then started on Levophed, which subsequently improved the
above.

An arterial blood gas was obtained while on ten liters face
mask and that revealed the following values:  7.26/56/109.
Because she was DNI, a trial of BiPAP was performed and she
was not intubated.  However, this was discontinued because
she could not tolerate BiPAP secondary to discomfort while
wearing the mask.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not obtained.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with her
husband and two daughters.  She also has another daughter.
She has no alcohol history.  She smoked thirty-five plus
years but stopped smoking three years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature
97.0, pulse 89, blood pressure 82/42, oxygen saturation 96%
on ten liters cool nebulizer.  In general, the patient is
oriented times two in moderate respiratory distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - Mucous membranes
are dry.  No jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular is
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Distant heart sounds.  Respiratory - Decreased breath sounds
throughout, crackles at the left lung base greater than
right, scattered wheezes.  Abdomen reveals mild epigastric
tenderness and no rebound, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA AND DIAGNOSTICS:  On admission,
electrocardiogram showed an atrial fibrillation at a rate of
66 beats per minute and normal axis, Q wave in V1, diffuse T
wave flattening and inversions in V4 and V5, but no change
compared to that done at outside hospital.

Chest x-ray revealed a right lower lobe opacity and a
retrocardiac density.

White blood cell count was 7.5, hematocrit 29.7, platelet
count 162,000.  INR 1.6, partial thromboplastin time 36.4.
Normal chemistries with the exception of a potassium of 3.5,
blood urea nitrogen 8 and creatinine of 3.0.  Normal liver
function tests.  Cardiac enzymes revealed a CPK of 19, CK MB
of 3.0 and a troponin of 0.5.  The patient's magnesium level
was low at 1.5.  Her calcium was 7.9, phosphate was 3.5.  The
patient's blood gases on 100% nonrebreather mask were
7.29/57/113.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 60 year old female with a
history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, also with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recurrent line
infections, admitted to the outside hospital for treatment of
permacath line infection.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube.  On arrival, the patient was found to be
hypertensive along with an arterial blood gas consistent with
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for aggressive treatment of her
hypotension with pressor support, management of possible
pulmonary edema, management of overwhelming sepsis, and
monitoring of her electrolytes and mental status.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The following is a summary of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course by systems:

1.  Respiratory - The patient was diagnosed with acute
hypercarbic respiratory failure likely triggered by
pneumonia, all this on top of a setting of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  BiPAP was attempted at the
time of hospitalization, however, the patient could not
tolerate the mask.  The patient was maintained on ten liters
face mask during which her saturation was satisfactory.  The
patient remained tachypneic throughout her hospital stay.
Serial chest x-rays continued to reveal bilateral pleural
effusions and congestive heart failure.  The patient
continued to receive nebulizer treatments throughout her
hospital stay for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She was continued on her face mask for noninvasive
ventilation, and towards the end of her hospital stay, she
was switched to BiPAP which she, unlike during the beginning
of her hospital stay, began to tolerate.  She was treated for
possible pneumonia, the treatment of which is further
delineated under the infectious disease section.  She
received respiratory therapy in the form of nebulizer
treatments and chest physical therapy and suctioning
throughout her hospital stay.  The patient's wish to remain
DNI was honored throughout her hospital stay.  When the
patient was made comfort measures only, she was taken off her
BiPAP and once again placed on a comfortable Venturi mask.
Respiratory cultures were obtained in the form of sputum
samples an
