Chief Complaint:
Fever + not acting like himself

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with COPD, CAD and admission for aspiration
pneunonia in [**1-/2108**] who was doing well at his senior nursing
home facility until about lunch today. He was noted to have
fever, rigors and "not acting like himself" which is why EMS was
called to transfer him to the unit. Of note, his daughter last
saw him two days ago when he was fully functional with good
appetite and no fever, chills or cough. She reports he had
problems with aspiration pneumonia at his old nursing home which
is why he was transferred to his current nursing home where he
had not had any aspiration pneumonia for a year.
.
Patient through his daughter reports doing well today with good
breakfast and lunch. He does not report much after that.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 100.0 rectal 114 180/92 30 98% NRB.
CXR showed infiltrate at right base. He was given
vancomycin/cefepime/levaquin for healthcare associated
pneumonia. He was given 1LNS. Labs significant for normal WBC,
HCT, platelets, electrolytes but creatinine of 1.6 and lactate
of 2.9. He was transferred to MICU due to elevated lactate in
setting of pneumonia.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he reports having right lower and upper
teeth pain. He reports having tooth extraction on his right
upper tooth two weeks ago and had his sutures removed yesterday.

[**11-29**] CXR- FINDINGS: AP portable view of the chest demonstrates
bibasilar opacities, new since prior exam, right > left. Left
costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of trace pleural
effusion. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. The
aortic arch calcifications are again noted. Mild cardiomegaly
persists. There is no pneumothorax. Partially imaged upper
abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower love opacities concerning for
pneumonia. Trace
left pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with PMH of COPD, h/o aspiration
pneumonia, CAD, diastolic heart failure, HTN, CKI with baseline
creatinine around 2, and DM2 who was admitted on [**11-29**] to the
ICU from his nursing facility for concern of aspiration
pneumonia low grade fevers, altered mental status, and lactate
of 2.9.
.
#. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's low grade fevers,
hypoxia, and altered mental status are likely secondary to an
aspiration pneumonia as he has had a history of aspiration in
the past and it appears the his PNA is developing in the RML on
CXR which is suggestive of aspiration.  Per report, he was also
on a regular diet with thin liquids per his preference when it
had been recommended in the past that he be on a soft diet with
nectar thickened liquids.  He was initially started on
Vancomycin/Zosyn in the ICU on [**11-30**] which was transitioned to
oral Augmentin 875mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-2**] to complete a 7 day antibiotic
course scheduled to end [**12-7**].  If he develops any diarrhea or
abdominal pain prior to [**12-7**], the antibioitcs should be stopped
altogether and his stool should be checked for C. diff.  Speech
and swallow re-evaluated him prior to discharge and once again
recommended a soft diet and nectar thickened liquids with 1:1
supervision.  His home Advair was continued and he will be given
an albuterol inhaler to use PRN.
.
#. CAD: Per prior history, the patient has suspected LAD
involvement but it is unclear whether there was an intervention.
 He was continued on his home regimen of aspirin, Plavix,
simvastatin, isosrbide, and metoprolol.
.
#. CKI: Creatinine at discharge was 1.4 which is below his
recent baseline of 2.
.
#. Type 2 DM. Patient was initially hypoglycemic to the 50s
requiring amps of D50 and D10 drip in setting of being NPO and
receiving glipizide prior to admission.  He was given one dose
of octreotide to reverse the glipizide effect.  Therefore, his
home metformin and glipizide were held throughout the admission.
 His sugars ranged from 170s-300s after his initial hypoglycemia
and were covered with an insulin sliding scale.  An A1C was sent
but pending at time of discharge.  Given his elevated
creatinine, his metformin will be discontinued altogether.  His
home glipizide will be restarted but the dose will be decreased
to 2.5mg of extended release daily from his previous dose of
10mg given his unreliable PO intake.  His sugars should be
monitored on this regimen and the dose should be escalated as
tolerated.
.
#. Gluacoma: Continue home eye drop regimen of
dorzolamide/timolol and latanoprost.
