Allergies:
Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath
Hypoxia
Hypercapneic respiratory failure
Pulmonary hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2133-7-6**] Cardiac Catherization

History of Present Illness:
67yo male with h/o liver transplant [**2126**], severe OSA, pulmonary
hypertension, and progressively worsening dyspnea over the last
two weeks, admitted for diuresis after elective cardiac cath
revealed biventricular elevated filling pressures, and now
transferred to CCU in setting of acute on chronic respiratory
acidosis requiring treatment with BiPAP.
.
Patient has had mild dyspnea on exertion at baseline for approx.
last 1-2 years, but over past several weeks has noted
progressively worsening dyspnea.  He has been unable to eat for
the last few days seocndary to dyspnea while eating. Recent
work-up by his pulmonologist, including PFTs, indicated severe
restrictive pulmonary dysfunction with reduced lung volumes, but
normal DLCO when calculated for lung volumes.  His pulmonologist
also felt there may be a component of diastolic heart failure
contributing to his worsening dyspnea, and he was referred for
an elective right cardiac cath which was performed earlier
today.  Cath revealed severely elevated biventricular filling
pressures, as well as severe pulmonary arterial hypertension
with only moderate elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance.
PCWP was 38, PASP was 96.

After cath, patient was admitted to the cardiology service for
diuresis, as it was felt his dyspnea was primarily related to
cardiac etiology vs. a pulmonary etiology. He received
furosemide 40mg IV once (home dose furosemide 20mg PO daily).
On arrival to floor, he appeared lethargic and was difficult to
arouse. An ABG revealed a respiratory acidosis: 7.23/70/73/31.
Of note, he had taken Benadryl 75mg PO at home prior to the
procedure, and also received Fentanyl 25 mcg while in the the
cath lab.  Respiratory therapy [**Name (NI) 653**], and patient
transferred to CCU for BiPAP.  On arrival to CCU, vitals were:
95.5 100 176/86 32 100% on 5L NC.  He had been started on a
nitro gtt in the cath lab after SBPs noted to be elevated to
200s, and after arrival in CCU his nitro gtt was titrated to
keep SBP <160.

Patient denied any chest pain, abdominal pain or nausea.  He was
unable to fully answer questions secondary to his lethargic
state, and a full review of systems could not be obtained.  Per
medical records, no prior history of stroke, TIA, DVT, or known
PE.  No recent fevers, chills, or rigors. No history of asthma
or COPD, but patient does have h/o smoking 1-1.5 PPD for 45
years.  He has a h/o OSA and has been non-adherent to using CPAP
in the past.  However per family report he has been using CPAP
consistently at night over past several months, and has also
been using for several hours a day.
.
Of note, patient has hematoma in right neck after failed right
IJ placement for procedure; procedure performed through left
femoral.

EOMI.
NECK: Right sided hematoma at site of attempted right IJ,
dressing stained with blood but no evidence of active bleeding,
hematoma has not increased in size since markings previously

difficult to assess as heart sounds distant
LUNGS: Slightly labored breathing, but no significant accessory
muscle use. Poor airmovement bilaterally with decreased breath
sounds at bases. ?Scattered crackles.

Reports:
TTE [**2133-7-7**]
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2132-10-2**].
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
CONCLUSIONS:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2132-10-2**], there is no definite change.
Unable to compare pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimates.

.
[**2133-7-6**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**6-8**], the patient
has taken a
somewhat better inspiration. There is again enlargement of the
cardiac
silhouette with worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and
bilateral pleural effusions. Atelectatic changes are seen at the
left base, and the possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot
be definitely excluded (especially in the absence of a lateral
view).
.
[**2133-7-8**] CXR:
1. New right lower lobe and middle lobe atelectasis.
2. Improvement of degree of vascular c
