History of MVR.

Status post MVR. There has been no change in heart size or
mediastinal width since the prior film of [**2132-4-30**]. There
are bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar
atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Allowing for technical
differences, no significant change since prior film other than
removal of left jugular Cordis catheter.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by
2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Normal
regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No
resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mildly
thickened aortic
valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate/severe MVP.
Severe mitral annular calcification. No MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] vena contracta is
>=0.7cm
Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.

2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).


3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear mildly thickened with
good leaflet
excursion and trace aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic
valve stenosis.

5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral
annular calcification around the posterior annulus. The mitral
regurgitation
vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

POST-BYPASS:

On the first two attempts to come off bypass a perivalvular leak
was seen
posteriorly. Moderate in nature. 3D echo helped delineate the
exact location
of the perivalvular leak. Third attempt at coming off bypass was
successful.
Patient is receiving an infusion of phenylephrine and
epinephrine and is being
AV paced.

1. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

2. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position. Leaftlets
open well and
the valve appears well seated. There is trace mitral
regurgitation which is
central.

3. Aorta intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71197**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission he
was brought to the operating room where he underwent a Mitral
Valve Replacement. Please see op note for surgical details.
following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-op day one his chest tubes were removed and he was weaned
off of any Inotropes. He was started on beta blockers and
diuretics and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On
post-op day two he was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. He continued to progress and had brief runs of AF.
 He was
started on coumadin on discharge as he had been on it
previously, but had d/c'd it for a prostate biopsy.  His INR and
coumadin dosing will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5057**].  He was
discharged to home in stable condition on POD#5.
