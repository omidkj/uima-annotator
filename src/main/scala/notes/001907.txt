Service:  CSU


SERVICE:  Cardiac Surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old woman with
a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus,
asthma and hypertension who presented to an outside hospital
with six hours of chest pain that woke her up at night,
occurred at rest and continued.  At the outside hospital, the
patient was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.  She
was treated with 25 mg of intravenous Diltiazem.  She
converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes were
negative.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Diabetes mellitus.

Obesity.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Lyme Disease.

Pulmonary nodules.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to ACE inhibitors which give her
a cough and she is allergic to codeine which causes shortness
of breath.

MEDICATIONS:  Preoperative medications include:
1. Adalat 60 mg p.o. q day.
2. Diovan 80 mg p.o. twice a day.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.o.d.
4. Flovent 110 micrograms, two puffs twice a day.
5. NPH insulin 14 units subcutaneously q a.m. and 20 units
   subcutaneously q p.m.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken for a cardiac
catheterization on [**7-14**] which showed three vessel coronary
artery disease.  The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
consultation and the decision was made to take the patient to
the Operating Room for a coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**7-17**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a coronary artery bypass graft times four,
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending;
saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery;
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein
graft to ramus as well as a RF Maze procedure which included a
radiofrequency ablation of the pulmonary vein.  Please see
Operative Note for full details.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and she was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on the evening of postoperative day zero,
required moderate amount of aggressive pulmonary toilet
initially.  On postoperative day number one, the patient was
started on beta blockers and remained hemodynamically stable.
The patient was noted to have an elevated white blood cell
count of 20 postoperatively.  This subsequently decreased to
11 the day prior to discharge.  The patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the
hospital on postoperative day number two.

In the evening of postoperative day number two, the patient
was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient
received intravenous Lopressor and Amiodarone and
subsequently converted into sinus rhythm.  The patient
remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of her hospital
stay.

The patient began working with Physical Therapy.  It was
decided that the patient would benefit from a stay at a short
term rehabilitation facility.  The decision was made by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] not to place the patient on any anti-coagulation for
the atrial fibrillation as she had been in continued sinus
rhythm since her one postoperative event.  The patient's
chest tubes were removed without incident.  The patient was
tolerating her Lopressor and by postoperative day number
four, she was cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation
facility by postoperative day number five.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature max 98.7 F.; pulse 56 in
sinus rhythm; blood pressure 119/50; room air oxygen
saturation 95 percent.  Neurologically, the patient is awake,
alert, and oriented times three with a nonfocal neurological
examination.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub or
murmur.  Respiratory:  Breath sounds are decreased at
bilateral bases.  Gastrointestinal:  Positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended, tolerating a regular diet.
The extremities are warm and well perfused with one to two
plus pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities.  Right
lower extremity vein harvest site is clean, dry and intact.
Sternal incision with staples are intact.  The incision is
clean and dry.  The sternum is stable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.0, hematocrit
29.1, platelet count 251.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.5,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 28, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6 and
glucose 135.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
2. Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice a day times ten days.
3. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. twice a day times ten days.
4. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
5. Zantac 150 mg p.o. twice a day.
6. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. twice a day.
7. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q day.
8. Valsartan 80 mg p.o. twice a day.
9. Flovent MDI, 110 micrograms, two puffs p.o. twice a day.
10.      Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o. q four to six hours p.r.n.
11.      Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q day times one month.
12.      NPH insulin 14 units subcutaneously q a.m. and 14
   units subcutaneously q p.m.
13.      Regular insulin sliding scale.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:

   stable condition.
2. The patient is to followup with her Cardiologist, Dr.
