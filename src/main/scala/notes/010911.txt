Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Demerol / Vicodin / amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Afib with RVR and hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
76F with Afib on warfarin s/p DCCV in [**2116**], h/o rheumatic fever
s/p AVR and MVR, h/o strep endocarditis, systolic CHF (EF=30% in
[**2117**]) and interstitial lung disease who presents to the ED after
she was noted to have a heart rate in the 130s at her PCP's
office.

The patient reports feeling generally unwell for the past [**4-14**]
days. She has had symptoms of worsening DOE with walking from
room to room in her home. She has had these symptoms several
times. Often associated with atrial fibrillation. She has noted
that her appetite has decreased lately and she has been
experiencing diarrhea for the last three days. She decribes the
stool as loose to liquid, no blood, no melana, or mucous. She
had seen her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week prior, who noted 'fluid in her
lungs' and her lasix dose was increased.

She has chronic 1+ orthopnea, no PND, no fluttering in her
chest, no chest pain/pressure, or dietary indiscretion. She
admits to decreased PO intake and appetite, she also states she
has a small amount of peripheral edema which is chronic.

She was at her PCPs this morning who noted a rapid heart rate.
EKG at the time reportedly, revealed atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response without evidence of ischemic changes
and she was referred to the ED.

Upon arrival to the ED, her initial vitals were 96.0, 128 99/59
20 96%.  Her labs and imaging significant for therapeutic INR of
2.8, Cr elevated to 4.2.  She was given diltiazem 10mg IV
followed by diltiazem 30mg PO with an SBP drop to the 70s.  She
has receieved a total of 1.5 liters of fluids and her SBPs have
slightly improved to the the 80-90s.  Her HR has remained in the
130s after dilt.  Given her borderline blood pressures, she was
admitted to the CCU for further management.  Her vitals on
transfer were 97.4, 91/62, 130, 99% 3 L NP.

Of note she has had several admissions to NEBH with hypovolemic
ARF and heart failure exacerbations. Most recently she had an
admission in [**2119-10-12**] for ARF with hyperkalemia. Her
Creatinine was 5.5 on admission, was treated with hydration and
her creatinine improved to 2.1

On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling well.  No
CP/pressure, no abdominal pain, no HA, no N/V.  She is breathing
comfortably and able to speak easily in full sentances.  Her LBM
this am.

[**2120-5-30**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25 %) with akinesis of the inferior segments and at
least hypokinesis of the remaining segments. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, additional focal wall motion abnormalities
cannot be fully excluded. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] A mechanical mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargment. Mildly dilated left ventricle
with severely depressed global left ventricular systolic
function with regional wall motion abnormalities as described
above. Mildly dilated ascending aorta and aortic arch.
Well-seated, normally functioning aortic and mitral mechanical
valve prostheses. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared to the previous study of [**2117-11-24**], the global left
ventricular sytolic function is slightly worse; LVEF previously
30%, now 20-25%. The left ventricle has minimally decreased in
size; previously 6.2 centimeters, now 5.9 centimeters.


Brief Hospital Course:
76F with Afib on warfarin, h/o rheumatic fever s/p mechanical
AVR and MVR in [**2098**], systolic CHF (EF=30%), interstitial lung
disease (question of amio toxicity), and h/o strep endocarditis
who presents with SOB and diarrhea x3 days, noted to be in afib
with RVR.
.
# AFib/RVR:
Patient presented in Afib with RVR in the setting of recently
increased Lasix dose, and as such volume depletion may have
precipitated her worsening RVR and tachycardia.  She is s/p
multiple DCCV in the past for her afib and has presumed
amiodarone toxicity.  She became hypotensive after receiving
dilt in the ED for rate control. She was mildly hypotensive on
admission to the CCU, and given her vital signs, it was decided
that she should be cardioverted to normal sinus. This was
performed successfully and she remained in sinus with good rate
control. Warfarin was continued and her INR was maintained at
goal 2.5-3.5. Carvedilol was increased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].

# Chronic systolic CHF
TTE showed EF 20-25% with TR and mod PHTN. Appeared somewhat dry
on exam on admission. Received some IV fluids with improvement
of blood pressures and heart rate. Lasix was held, then
restarted at a lower dose of 40mg daily PO. Lisinopril was also
held indefinitely given her low blood pressures. Carvedilol was
increased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
