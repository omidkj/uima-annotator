Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38616**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 84 yo man with a past medical history of HTN,
HL and recent diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma s/p four
weekly doses of Rituxan in [**7-/2119**] with repeat bone marrow in
[**Month (only) 205**] which revealed improvement in his disease burden who p/w
dyspnea. The patient was last seen in his usual state of health
9 days ago by the patient's nephew [**Name (NI) 382**]. Today, the nephew
picked up the patient for a routine visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**], his
Oncologist where it was noted that the patient was having
increased dyspnea on exertion and new bilateral ankle swelling.
At the visit, the patient was noted to be mildly hypoxic to the
mid 90s and abnormal lung sounds. A CXR was obtained which
showed a new moderate right pleural effusion.  Per report, an
EKG was unremarkable from clinic. The patient was admitted for
further workup of this new pleural effusion and bilateral ankle
swelling.
.
Currently, the patient feels well. He states his breathing has
been bothering him for the past "couple weeks." He denies
orthopnea, PND, fevers, chills, cough. States the leg swelling
has been ongoing for about the same amount of time.
.
Of note, did have mechanical fall in early [**Month (only) 359**] that caused a
non-operative subdural hemorrhage and a left wrist fracture
which is currently splinted.


Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:

pancytopenia and progressive fatigue. In the last year fatigue
has reached the point that the patient has difficulty with some
activities of daily living such a shoveling snow and ambulating
outside of his house. Patient also reports a recent weight loss
but denies fevers, chills or night sweats. Given the progression
of symptoms and counts a bone marrow biopsy was performed which
demonstrated a monoclonal B cell population consistent with a
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Patient started on Rituximab

.
[**2120-1-29**] TTE:
IMPRESSION: There is a circumferential pericardial effusion
which is relatively small. There is probably
tamponade/near-tamponade physiology. Reduced LVEF with
inferolateral and probable septal hypokinesis.
Comparison to echo of [**2120-1-24**], the right ventricle appears
smaller and there is probable tamponade physiology. The patient
is more tachycardic and in atrial fibrillation. Wall motion
abnormalities could not be compared as the current study was
limited.
.
[**2120-1-30**] TTE:
IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized pericardial effusion without evidense
of tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-29**],
the patient is no longer tachycardic. Short of a very brief
diastolic RV "dip", there are now no clear signs of impaired
ventricular fillling.
.
[**2120-1-30**] pCXR:
FINDINGS: One portable AP upright view of the chest. Moderate
right pleural effusion is new. Moderate left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.
Pulmonary edema has increased. Heart size may be slightly
increased which may represent slight increasing pericardial
effusion. No evidence of pneumonia.
IMPRESSION:
1. New right moderate pleural effusion. Left moderate pleural
effusion is
unchanged.
2. Heart size slightly bigger which may indicate a slight
increase in
pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, can correlate
with
echocardiogram.
3. Increased pulmonary edema.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT torso:
CHEST: Unenhanced images of the chest demonstrate
atherosclerotic
calcifications within the normal-caliber aorta. There is no
intramural
hematoma. On contrast-enhanced images, there is no evidence of
pulmonary
embolus or aortic dissection. The moderate pericardial effusion
has minimally increased in size. Left greater than right
moderate pleural effusions have also increased in size. There is
adjacent compressive atelectasis on the left. Patchy areas of
consolidation at the right base are new. The airways are patent
to the subsegmental levels. In addition to patchy right basilar
opacities, there are scattered ground-glass opacities in the
left and right upper lobe, lower lobes and middle lobe, mostly
dependent posteriorly. The heart is at the upper limits of
normal in size. Coronary artery calcifications which are
moderate to severe are noted. There is also atherosclerotic
calcification throughout the thoracic aorta.
ABDOMEN: There is periportal edema. The hepatic and portal veins
are patent as is the splenic vein. The spleen has increased in
size when compared to prior PET-CT, now measuring 17.0 cm in AP
dimension (previously 15.9 cm). In addition, there are multiple
peripheral hypodense regions (3B:95, 3B:108, 3B:112) which may
relate to splenic infarctions. The pancreas and right adrenal
gland are within normal limits. The left adrenal gland is
difficult to visualize. A small gastric diverticulum is noted
(3B:88-92). The kidneys demonstrate symmetric uptake and
excretion of contrast. There is no hydronephrosis. Bilateral
simple cysts
