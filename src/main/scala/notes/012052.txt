History of Present Illness:
 year-old male with HCV/ETOH cirrhosis, HCC with diuretic

clear yellow fluid. He has reported a slight re-accumulation of
fluid since his last paracentesis. Attempt was made at
radiofrequency ablation and CyberKnife therapy, which was
unsuccessful. He was given sorafenib in [**2139-2-3**], but
could not tolerate this.  He underwent chemoembolization of the
right lobe of the liver on [**2139-5-13**]. Last afp=17.7.
Currently, he reports ascites has progressively worsened over

mild
low back pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 y/o male with ESLD due to Hep C/ETOH cirrhosis and HCC now
with diuretic resistant ascites who presents for liver
transplant. Of note he was called in several times previously
over the last few weeks.  He was taken to the OR on [**8-7**] by Drs
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed an orthotopic liver
transplant with duct-to-duct anastomosis. The patient tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the SICU, stable,
intubated. He received protocol induction immunosuppression
which included Solumedrol, and Cellcept, and started Prograf on
pos op day 1.

He was extubated on POD 1. In the post op period he required
transfusion of 5 units RBCs and 3 units platelets. Over the
course of the hospitalization the platelet count increased and
the HCT remained stable.
He was transferred out of the SICU on POD 3. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
evaluation of the liver revealed normal vasculature except the
right hepatic artery. This was possibly a technical difficulty
due to large abdominal size. A repeat U/S done on [**8-14**] showed
all patent vasculature including the RHA. There was some concern
due to velocities in the main portal vein ranging from 109 to
149 cm/sec, which was similar to the previous study. An MR was
initially suggestive of a Portal Vein stenosis and the patient
was initiated on a heparin drip. Portal venography was performed
on [**8-15**] showing discrepancy in size between the native and donor
portal veins with relative stenosis, but no significant pressure
gradient across the anastomosis. No interventions were performed
after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**].
Drain Bili measured on [**8-16**] was 8.1. The patient had one
remaining JP at the time of this test which was putting out
about 1-1.2 liters of ascitic fluid tinged with bile daily.
Liver enzymes (AST and ALT) which had briefly elevated at the
time of the portal venography trended back to normal. Alk phos
remained slightly elevated in addition to serum bilirubin of
5.9.

On [**8-19**], an ERCP was performed for concern for bile leak as the
JP bili was 25.7. This revealed biliary narrowing at the site of
duct to duct anastomosis. No extravasation of contrast was noted
- high pressure cholangiogram was not obtained given recent
transplant. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and a biliary
stent was inserted. Recommendations included repeating an ERCP
in 2 months. LFTs trended down and the JP drainage decreased. A
CT without iv contrast was performed on [**8-20**] to assess for a
perihepatic collection. A collection was noted and this was
drained in CT for 260cc of serosanguinous fluid. A pigtail drain
was left in place. Culture of this fluid was negative. The
perihepatic drain and JP were left in place at time of discharge
from the hospital. VNA services were arranged to assist with
this at home. The JP drainage was ~700-1400cc/day.


On [**8-17**] (pod 9), the apex area of the incision was opened due to
inadequete approximation of the incision and fluid noted at the
site. A gram stain and culture were submitted and he was started
on Ancef. Gram stain had 1+pmns without growth on the culture.
Two 2x2 gauzes were placed at the apex.

Immunosuppression consited of cellcept, prednisone and prograf
titrated to  2mg [**Hospital1 **].

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtain for assist with insulin management
of hyperglycemia. Initially, he was on an insulin drip in the
SICU, but this was switched to humalog sliding scale and
glargine insulin. He did well with insulin teaching and
experienced no low blood sugars.

He was ambulatory, vital signs were stable and he was tolerating
a regular diet when discharged home.
