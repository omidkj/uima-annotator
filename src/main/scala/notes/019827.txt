palpitations

EP study


History of Present Illness:
75yo female with h/o multiple PCI's (LAD stent; 70% OM stenosis
and RCA occlusion medically managed), ischemic heart failure
with EF 35-45% with posterobasal aneurysm, s/p ICD after VTach
during NSTEMI for which she received a DDD/ICD, s/p VTach
ablation [**6-/2163**] who initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**]
with palpitations and a shock from her ICD within the last few
weeks. Per report, she had recently been admitted in [**Month (only) 547**] and
[**6-29**] with firing of her defibrillator. On [**2164-7-8**] she was
feeling unwell on newly started flecanide with intermittent
nausea/vomiting. Additionally was suffering from lightheadedness
and falls without LOC. She denies firing of her AICD at that
time. On initial evaluation she was found to be dehydrated with
hyponatremia of 126. Her felcanide was decreased from 100 to 50
mg po BID as she was having nausea. She was admitted for
evaluation. Sodium corrected daily to greater than 135. Per
verbal report and telemetry strips, the patient had episodes of
wide complex tachycardias. Per OSH [**Month (only) 16**] review, procainamide was
started on [**2164-7-16**]. Per verbal report and review of EKG's from
the OSH, a coronary catherization was performed apparently to
assess for an ischemic source of her VT. No documentation of the
catherization is provided with the patient on transfer. No
discharge summary accompanies the patient on transfer.
In the CCU, patient is fatigued but otherwise without
complaints.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90719**] is a 75 year old female with history of hypertension
(HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD) and difficult to control
Ventricular tachycardia (VT) status post implantable
cardiodefibrillator (ICD) who presented with recurrent VT.  She
underwent ablation of [**8-5**] VT tracks in the cath lab but
continued to have VT afterward, necessitating continued therapy
with mexilitine.
.
# VT: Patient has complicated history of VT s/p ICD placement
and continues to have bouts of VT despite
flecanide/procainamide.  Spontaneously resolves on telemetry.
Patient is symptomatic, feeling unwell and nervous.  She was
maintained on procainamide to reduce the duration of VT until
taken to the ablation by the electrophysiology team.  On [**7-17**]
she underwent VT track ablation of [**8-5**] different tracks but
continued to have VT aferward.  She was hypotensive after the
case and was on pressors for 24 hours.  She was also intubated
for the ablation and was electively maintained on mechanical
ventilation and sedation for the full night of the 19th to let
her sympathetic drive resolve in hopes of reducing her VT
episodes.  She was sucesfully extubated on [**7-18**] and her pressors
were weaned off on [**7-18**] with a 500 cc bolus of NS.  Her
hematocrit dropped and she did recieve 2 units of packed RBCs as
well as a CT abd and pelvis which was negative for
retroperitoneal hematoma.  She was taken off procainamide after
the case and started on mexilitine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **].

# CAD: Had a stent in LAD from prior. No chest pain during
admission and EKGs were not consistent with ischemia.  She
underwent a cardiac cath at th
