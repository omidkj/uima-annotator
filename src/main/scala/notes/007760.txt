History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67 yo m with ESRD (on HD MWF), ESLD [**2-8**] polycystic liver
disease who presented to [**Location (un) **] after 3 days of myalgias,
cough, SOB, and not able to get out of bed. He had been in his
USOH prior to this. At OSH, T 101.3, he was noted to have CXR
with LLL pna and received levaquin and 250cc IVF. At that time,
SBP 70-90's with normal BP 100's.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to bed shortages at OSH. In [**Hospital1 **]
ED, T98.7; HR 120-130's; BP 63-77/50's; RR89% RA and 100% NRB.
Lactate 1.3. Given low BP, a CVL was sterilely placed and he was
started on levophed. CVP was 15 once levophed on board. EKG with
afib and lateral ST depressions. He also received a dose of
clindamycin in ED.
.
Upon arrival to ICU, he is currently feeling comfortable in no
distress. he denies any chest pain, SOB, pleuritic pain,
abdominal pain, or any other symptoms. He does note that for
past few days he had orthopnea, which is new for him. Per his
wife, last week he also had one episode of severe lower
abdominal pain. he went to HD at that time and there was some
concern for a ruptured liver cyst; however, his wife does not
think he had any imaging at that time. This pain has since
resolved.

RADS

TTE [**4-6**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function appears mildly depressed (LVEF= 50%), but
could not be fully evaluated because of technical limitations.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe RV systolic
dysfunction. Probable mild left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Heavily calcified valves.

If clinically indicated, a full transthoracic study with Doppler
is recommended.
.
TTE [**4-7**]
The left ventricle is not well seen. The left ventricular cavity
is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50
%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-4-6**],
the image quality is no better. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is slightly lower but is probably unreliable
given poor image quality. The other findings are similar.
.
CTA [**4-7**]

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Cardiomegaly with prominence of the right heart and
enlargement of the
main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
3. Right lower lobe consolidation/volume loss. Left lower lobe
with
consolidation or volume loss and occluded left lower bronchus.
4. Diffuse emphysematous changes.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Ascites. Anasarca.
6. Massively enlarged multicystic liver. Status post bilateral
nephrectomy.
7. Cystic changes in both femoral heads and acetabula.
Differential includes
changes secondary to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Comparison
is recommended
with old studies if available.
8. Mediastinal nodes, largest measuring 16mm.
9. Sigmoid diverticulosis without definite evidence of
diverticulitis.
10. Cholelithiasis without definite evidence of cholecystitis.
11. Right lower quadrant diverting ileostomy. No evidence of
obstruction.
12. NG tube and ET tube in proper placement.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 67 y/o M hx of ESRD on HD and ESLD [**2-8**]
polycystic liver/kindey disease who presented after 3 days of
myalgians, fever, cough, new infiltrate on CXR and hypotension
requiring pressors.

Brief Course:

He was transferred here on [**2200-4-6**] [**2-8**] bed shortages at OSH. He
arrived and was
stable but developed A fib to 140s and decompensated requiring
intubation, his AF was eventually controlled with amiodarone
bolus and drip as well as esmolol. Pt was found with influenza
A, c/b VAP. He was successfully extubated, but had persistent
oxygen requirement.  He was continued on broad spectrum
antibiotics for possible VAP. He was found to have severe RV
dilation and hypokinesis.  He was initiated on CVVH for fluid
overload which resulted initially in improved blood pressures.
He tolerated weaning from three pressors to one.
Throughout his hospitalization he had persistent pressor
requirement despite negative blood and sputum cultures.
In setting of patients grim overall prognosis a palliative care
consult was initiated to assist the family with end of life care
and transition to CMO status.  The patient was made CMO on [**4-17**],
pressors and CVVH were discontinued and expired shortly
thereafter.
