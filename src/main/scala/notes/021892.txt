Imaging/Studies:
CXR: Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is unremarkable. This
study neither
confirms nor excludes the possibility of non-radiopaque foreign
body in the esophagus and if clinically warranted, further
correlation with CT or barium swallowing (upper GI study) should
be considered.
Lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Multiple osteophytes of the thoracic spine are demonstrated on
the lateral
projection.

EGD: Impression: Food in the lower third of the esophagus
(foreign body removal)
Erythema and congestion in the lower third of the esophagus
Erythema and congestion in the whole examined stomach
No esophageal stenosis or stricture
Diverticulum in the upper third of the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to stomach body
Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms, and the
residual food bolus in the esophagus is known to be
non-obstructing.
No esophageal stenosis or stricture noted, so symptoms are
likely due to an esophageal dysmotility issue.
NPO for now, trial of clear liquid sips in AM. If does not
tolerate sips, will need repeat endoscopy in AM.


Brief Hospital Course:
66F with HTN, asthma, recurrent food impactions requiring
endoscopy now presenting with likely food impaction.
.
1. Esophageal food impaction: Pt has h/o recurrent food
impactions requiring endoscopy although none in our system.
Given inability to control own secretions, she is being admitted
to MICU for endoscopy. Differential diagnosis of recurrent food
impaction includes mechnical obstruction such as stricture or
ring or eosinophilic esophagitis.   GI was consulted who
performed the EGD on [**2174-2-21**] which showed no stricture or mass,
just erythema. After EGD, pt's symptoms improved and per their
recs, pt's diet was advanced as tolerated.  Pt was then
discharged home with outpt GI f/u appt and a esophageal
dysmotility study in 2 weeks.
.
2.  Chest pressure: Has had intermittent chest pain last [**4-19**]
days associated with viral symptoms and worse with laying flat.
Differential diagnosis includes pericarditis, bronchitis.
Unlikely secondary to  or [**Location (un) **] related to food impaction and/or
recent cough/cold symptoms. CXR without acute infiltrate or e/o
perforation and ECG WNL.  Pt was ruled our for MI with neg CEs.
The chest pressure resolved.
.
3. HTN: Pt was continued on home HCTZ
.
4. Asthma: Pt was continued on flovent, albuterol prn
.
5. BRBPR: Likely secondary to hemorrhoids given symptoms
occurred with strained BM in setting of constipation. Hct
remained stable requiring no transfusions and pt was
hemodynamically stable throughout hospital stay.
.
6. Chronic pain: Pt was continued on home percocet
.
Pt was initially NPO, then advanced diet after EGD.  Pt was on
Heparin SC for DVT ppx.  Pt was full code.
