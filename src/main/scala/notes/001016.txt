Chief Complaint:
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old gentleman with recent CABG x 2 and
MVR (OnX mechanical valve)/ MAZE/PFO closure admitted for
hypotension and bradycardia s/p DC cardioversion for
aflutter/atach. Per [**Name (NI) **], pt was recently admitted in [**2149-4-5**]
for subtherapeutic INR. During that admission, he was found to
be in aflutter. At that time he was on Toprol Xl and amiodarone.
Per the patient, amiodarone was then discontinued. Given his
multiple recent surgeries, DC cardioversion was thought to be
the best option for rhythm control. The patient himself has not
had symptoms of tachycardia, no CP, no SOB.
.
The patient underwent DC cardioversion with sedation. He then
became hypotensive and was bradycardic in a junctional rythm. He
was placed on dopamine and recovered his blood pressure. He was
subsequently admitted to the ICU for observation. Currently he
states that he felt dizzy after cardioversion, but now feels
well.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 69 year old gentleman with a history of afib, COPD and
endocarditis underwent CABG x 2, mechanical MVR, closure of
patent foramen ovale, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] ligation and MAZE procedure
on [**2149-1-13**] s/p DC cardioversion with subsequent hypotension and
bradycardia.
.
# Rhythm: The patient was admitted with afib/flutter for DC
cardioversion. After cardioversion the patient was hypotensive
to SBp 80's and bradycardic with a junctional rhythm of 40's. He
was placed on dopamine. Just after cardioversion, he felt dizzy
but was assymptomatic from then on. He was weaned off the
dopamine. Intially, he remained in a junctional rythm but he
sinus node then recovered to a sinus bradycardia with occaisonal
pauses. He was able to increase his HR to 60's with walking and
did not feel lightheaded or weak with excercise. Pacemaker
implantation was discussed with the pt who declined and strongly
desired to avoid device implantation.  His beta blocker was
stopped.
.
# Valves: Prosthetic Mitral Valve, no acute issues. His goal INR
is 2.5-3.5. Heparin gtt was started with a low INR and coumadin
held in setting of possible pacemaker placement. Coumadin was
restarted when it was decided not to place a pacemaker. He was
kept in hospital on heparin until his INR reached 2.5; it
reached 2.6 on the day of discharge.

statin. BB was discontinued.
