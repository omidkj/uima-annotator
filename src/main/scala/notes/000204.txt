Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L Burr holes for SDH

History of Present Illness:
84 year old male s/p recent burr holes for Right SDH presents
from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with several days of progressive right-sided
weakness. His son also noted that he was speaking less than
normal. That patient does not report any pain at this time. He
was initally seen as a Code Stroke in the ER today because of
the
right-sided weakness. Then he had a CT scan which showed an
enlargement of the previous SDH and neurosurgery was called to
evaluate him.

Pertinent Results:
CT BRAIN PERFUSION [**2162-8-23**] 2:04 PM
FINDINGS: As compared to CT head from [**2162-8-12**], there has
been
interval increase in size of left cerebral subdural (air and
fluid) collection measuring 3.2 cm in thickness, previously
measured 2.2 cm. The fluid portion of this collection appears
more dense with layering hyperdensity which may represent acute
hemorrhage. There is increased mass effect on the left cerebral
hemisphere and approximately 7 mm shift of midline structures
(compared with 4-mm on prior CT). There is no definite [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-
white matter differentiation abnormality. Dilatation of the
ventricles corresponds to sulcal prominence, likely secondary to
age- appropriate involution. Periventricular and subcortical
foci of hypodensity are likely related to microvascular ischemic
changes. Left- sided skull defects representing location of
prior drainage catheter are noted. Right- sided craniotomy
defect is also noted. There is no depressed skull fracture.
There is right nasal septum deviation with small right-sided
spur.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of left subdural air and
fluid
collection with increased mass effect on the left cerebral
hemisphere and
midline shift.

CTA HEAD W&W/O [**2162-8-23**] 2:04 PM
FINDINGS: As compared to CT head from [**2162-8-12**], there has
been
interval increase in size of left cerebral subdural (air and
fluid) collection measuring 3.2 cm in thickness, previously
measured 2.2 cm. The fluid portion of this collection appears
more dense with layering hyperdensity which may represent acute
hemorrhage. There is increased mass effect on the left cerebral
hemisphere and approximately 7 mm shift of midline structures
(compared with 4-mm on prior CT). There is no definite [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-

defect is also noted. There is no depressed skull fracture.
There is right nasal septum deviation with small right-sided
spur.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of left subdural air and
fluid
collection with increased mass effect on the left cerebral
hemisphere and
midline shift.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2162-8-23**]
FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained.
There is a new left frontal/parietal craniotomy, as well as
preexisting
calvarial postsurgical chagnes. The left subdural hematoma has
decreased in size, now measuring 1 cm in greatest diameter, with
evidence of new acute blood products. There is a small left
epidural collection underlying the craniotomy. In addition to
left-sided pneumocephalus, there is a small amount of
right-sided pneumocephalus and a small right parafalcine
isodense subdural collection, not seen previously.
There is diffuse sulcal effacement in the left cerebral
hemisphere. There is mass effect on the left lateral ventricle
which is improved compared to the prior study. The right lateral
ventricle is stable in size. There is
approximately 5 mm of left to right midline shift on the current
study
compared to 8 mm previously.
There is stable prominence of the extra-axial space in the left
posterior
fossa without evidence of acute hemorrhage.
There are periventricular white matter hypodensities which are
most likely
related to chronic ischemic microvascular disease. Age-related
cerebral
atrophy is again noted.
There is polypoid mucosal thickening in the lateral recess of
the right
sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:
1. The left subdural hematoma has decreased in size but
demonstrates new acute blood products, which could be related to
recent evacuation or post-operative bleeding. Partial
improvement in associated mass effect. These findings were
communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2162-8-23**] at 11:50 p.m.
2. New small right parafalcine isodense subdural collection.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2162-8-25**]
FINDINGS: Pneumocephalus has slightly redistributed, though with
overall
volume appearing similar to study from 1 day earlier.
Heterogeneous subdural collection layering over the left
convexity is stable in size with similar hyperdense hemorrhagic
component. There is associated right deviation of normal midline
anatomy of approximately 7 mm, unchanged, resulting in mild mass
effect on the left lateral ventricle. Overall, the ventricles
and sulci are unchanged in size and configuration. There is no
new focus of hemorrhage. Bilateral craniotomy changes are also
stable. Subcutaneous gas overlying the left frontotemporal
region is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Minimal change from one day prior, with
redemonstration of left subdural hematoma, pneumocephalus, and
7mm rightward shift of midline
structures with probable trapping of the contralateral ventricle
(based on
comparison with [**2157**] studies).

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2162-8-26**]
Overall unchanged study from prior of [**2162-8-25**]. Stable
rightward shift and stable appearance of subdural hematoma.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2162-8-30**] 2:05 PM
Bilateral areas of pulmonary edema appear relatively unchanged;
however, there is an area of increased density within the right
upper lobe which might be related to asymmetric pulmonary edema
or aspiration. Increasing small left pleura
