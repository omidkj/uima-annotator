Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5378**]
Chief Complaint:
Baclofen Overdose.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year-old female who is a pathologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] with a
history of worsening MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presents to the ED
with Baclofen overdose. The history was obtained from the
patient's husband. The patient has relapsing progressive
multiple sclerosis that has been worsening over the last two
years and has been wheelchair bound. The husband states that she
has had [**Last Name (Titles) **] for years, but seemed more depressed over the
last week. He could not identify a particular trigger, but
thought that the holidays had made things worse. The patient was
at home alone when the husband got a call from his wife who was
tearful and said she had taken "20 tabs" of baclofen, but the
husband thought she had taken more. Per ED they had estimated
~80-170 pills equaling 3400mg) He called EMS and on arrival they
cound her "sleepy" and tachycardic to the 120-140's.
.
In the ED she was 97.6 98 158/78 14 100% RA. She became more
somnolent then unresponsive and was intubated for airway
protection. She was started on a propofol gtt in the ED. Initial
vent settings were Tv: 500, PEEP: 5, RR: 12 and FiO2: 50%. CXR
showed right main-stem intubation and tube was withdrawn 3 cm.
Her ABG was 7.32/45/132/24. She was given 25g of charcoal. Her
labs were significant for a tox screen positive for opiates and
amphetamines. She had a mildly positve UA and was give cipro.
She was seen by Tox in the ED who recommended supportive care,
tachyarrhythmias per ACLS and bradydysrhythmias with atropine.
.
On arrive to the ICU the patient was intubated and sedated.
.
ROS: unable to obtain

and FFs slightly weak (5-/5). Elsewhere mostly [**4-8**]. Tone
relatively normal in UEs but prominent spasticity bilaterally in
LEs with only trace IP movement, [**4-8**] quads, 2-3/5 foot DFs. Toes

Imaging:
[**2160-1-11**] CXR: OGT in stomach. RUE PICC stable. Lungs remain clear
without effusion or pneumothorax.
[**2160-1-8**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This tracing gives evidence for a severe
diffuse
encephalopathy with periods of runs of what looks like
relatively
sustained epileptiform activity over both central regions and
also
occasional multifocal independent interictal epileptiform spike
wave
discharges seen on the spike detection algorithm only. It is
also noted
that the frequency of the sustained epileptiform activity seemed
to
decrease during the course of the study.
[**2160-1-7**] CXR: The ET tube tip continues to be relatively low, 2 cm
above the carina. There is progression of the left lower lobe
opacities, still most likely represent atelectasis, but should
be further followed to exclude the possibility of developing
infection. Otherwise, no significant change has been
demonstrated.
[**2160-1-6**] CXR: The patient is intubated with the tip of the ET tube
in the
proximal aspect of the right main stem bronchus. If the tube is
withdrawn
approximately 3 cm, it would be appropriately positioned. There
is left
retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
present.
There is an OG tube within the stomach. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  IMPRESSION: Right
mainstem bronchial intubation. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year-old female pathologist with history of worsening MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34499**] admitted with Baclofen overdose.  Hospital course
complicated by seizures and delirium.
.
#Baclofen overdose: Husband reports that she took 70 Baclofen
pills. Tox screen was negative for coexisting substances.  She
was intubated for airway protection given sedation in the ED.
She was seen by toxicology in the ED who recommended supportive
care.  On the first hospital day, she had brady and
tachyarrhythmias.  In addition, she had two seizures that day-
the first of which was self limited and the second which did not
respond to IV Ativan.  She was started on a midazolam drip for
seizure prevention.  She was subsequently loaded with Dilantin
and then midazolam was weaned once Dilantin was therapeutic.
She was also hooked up to cEEG. The seizures were beleived to be
due to Baclofen withdrawal. Her Baclofen was restarted at half
dose 36 hours after intoxication taking the half life of
Baclofen into consideration.  It was subsequently increased to
home dose. Her EEG improved after she was restarted on her home
dose of Baclofen. Her Dilantin was then stopped as she does not
have an underlying seizure disorder but rather had seizures as
she was withdrawing from thr Baclofen.
.
#Respiratory Distress: She was intubated for airway protection
in the setting of sedating overdose with Baclofen.  Initial CXR
showed right main stem intubation with subsequent LLL
atelec
