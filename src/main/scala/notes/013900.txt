History of Present Illness:
75 yo F w/ severe 3vd s/p multiple stents on recent admission
p/w chest pain, s/p NSTEMI from OSH. SHe was woken from sleep
with 8/10 chest pressure similar to prior angina and presented
to [**Hospital1 1774**] w/ SOB, nausea and chest pressure. She was initially in
heart failure and hypoxic to 80% and was given lasix 40mg IV en
route to hospital. On arrival she was placed on Bipap, got
another 50mg IV lasix and put out 1200mL urine within 3 hours
and her respiratory status significantly improved. Her chest
pain resolved after several nitros but returned this morning
prior to transport and then again resolved with nitro. Heparin
drip was started. Trop I was elevated at 0.96 then peaked at
2.95 with but CK 133. BNP was elevated at 959. There were no new
ST -T wave changes. She was continued on ASA, plavix,
metoprolol, statin.
.
She was admitted last month with cath x 3 and several stents
placed. It was thought that she may have had an LMCA dissection
but on review of imaging it appears that this is not true. Her
plan had been a staged procedure consisting of CABG (LIMA-LAD)
and stenting but unclear what the [**Name (NI) **] plan would be now if she
is a candidate. She was a high risk surgical candidate for poor
sternal wound healing She went to [**Hospital1 **] then Home and then
right back into local hospital with Pulmonary Edema. She was not
intubated, diuresed, no unstable EKG changes, no evolving
changes. Got blood transfusion 1 Unit for for HCT 26.5 and SOB
again occurred but resolved prior to transfer. FAMILY requested
the transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
HCT 25.4 without source of bleeding, receiving blood today
.
She is on tele, IV Hep, O2 via NC, IV Bumex, groin site fine
Was on Bipap in ER and responded??????.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F with severe 3VD s/p multiple stents, [**Location (un) 3484**] disease
s/p laser removal of pituitary adenoma now on chronic steroids,
HTN, HLD p/w chest pressure and new O2 requirement likely in the
setting of demand with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
.
# Chest pain/PUMP: Chest pain was most likely due to demand
ischemia in the setting of acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure.  Presented with STE initially, which resolved and pain
resolved with nitro. Elevated trop, which was elevated prior,
but no elevation of CK/MB. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], who did her prior caths,
was consulted and recommended not doing a cath again unless
intractable chest pain as it may not have improved her sx and
she has known cardiac disease with multiple stents.  On initial
exam, appeared overloaded with lower extermity edema and had
crackles on exam.  Diuresis with IV bumex was initiated.  She
was transferred to the CCU on day of admission, where diuresis
was continued with IV bumex and lasix volume status improved and
recurrent chest pain resolved. She was also put on stress dose
steroids for her h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3484**] disease, s/p laser ablation of
pituitary, as described below.  She was transitioned back to her
home dose of PO bumex
.
# CORONARIES: Has known 3vd as described above, and chest pain
thought to be [**2-26**] demand ischemia from CHF exacerbation rather
than from ACS.  Initially was started on heparin gtt, but was
dc'ed.  No cath was done, likely not a candidate for surgery so
she was medically managed with her regimen of aspirin, plavix,
simvastatin 80, metoprolol, lisinopril, and imdur was started.
.
# CCU Course: On HD2, patient developed fever to 101.7 with new
infiltrate on CXR. She was started on vancomycin/cefepime for
empiric HCAP. Over the course of the day, her mental status
declined and she became difficult to arouse and she was
transferred to the CCU. She was observed in the unit overnight
where her respiratory status remained stable and her mental
status improved. After a one day stay, she was returned to the
general medical floor.
.
#RHYTHM: NSR, was monitored on tele with no events.
.
#RLE cellulitis: had painful, erythematous, well defined skin
lesion on RLE and fever at OSH so was started on vancomycin, for
MRSA considering history, and cefepime, considering h/o DM. Was
transitioned to PO abx of levofloxacin and keflex for total 10
day course.
.
# Cushings: Is on chronic steroids for panhypopituitarism s/p
laser ablation of pituitary in the setting of [**Location (un) 3484**] Disease.
 Dose was doubled in thes etting of illness and infection.  On
discharge, was transitioned back to home dose.
.
# DM:  home regimen of glargine 48U qAM and 15U qPM  continued,
home pioglitizone was discontinued, with well controlled FS on
insulin.
.
# Hypothyroid: continued synthroid
.
# Depression: continued escitalopram
