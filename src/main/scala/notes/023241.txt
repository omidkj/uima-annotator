Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for possible trach by thoracics.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 **] intubated

History of Present Illness:
73 year old man with history of obesity, diabetes, unspecified
chronic lung disease who initially presented to [**Hospital3 12594**] on [**5-22**] with acute respiratory distress. Prior to
presentation he was reportedly sick for a couple of days and
became short of breath on [**5-21**] almost to the point of developing
stridor. Also complaining of pain with swallowing, right ear
pain and right neck pain.

In the ED ENT performed an indirect laryngoscopy which revealed
edema and exudate of the posterior trachea. In the ED he was
placed on BiPAP. He was given Unasyn and Ceftriaxone in the ED
for swelling and crusting of his right ear, and started on
steroids for concern of laryngeal edema.

The patient was admitted to the ICU. He had warmth and edema on
the right side of his face and neck along with induration that
obscured the angle of the mandible. A gram stain revealed +1
WBC, +1 GPC, +1, GNR and +1 Yeast; throat Cx returned positive
for group A strep. He was felt to have acute pharyngitis with
angioedema, right external cellulitis (sparing ear canal and
TM), right upper cervical lymphadenitis, right supraglottitis
with a probable soft tissue infection of the right neck. Needle
aspirate was attempted of right soft pallate without any pus.
His antibiotics were changed to Vanc/zosyn and for a time
clindamycin IV ([**Date range (1) 82121**]) and bactroban to right ear; IV steroids
were continued. Initial labs were significant for a WBC of 24
and a HCT of 43; ABG: 7.29/56/78 on 30% BiPAP. A CT scan on [**5-22**]
revealed swelling in the retropharyngeal area. At that time
there was a concern for a LLL infiltrate on CXR. On [**2177-5-23**] he
began to retain C02 and later had an ABG of 7.11/144 (attributed
to underlying lung disease and increased amounts of morphine);
at that time he went to the OR for an ET tube placed by ENT. A
trach was attempted but his trachea was in his thorax so an ET
tube was sutured into his retropharyngeal area. A repeat CT on
[**5-24**] showed extensive infiltrate and/or hematoma in the
retropharyngeal area. CT on [**5-26**] showed decreased swelling.
During his MICU stay he underwent acute renal failure (Cr to
3.5). Renal was consulted and it was felt to be dehydration. Cr
resolved to 1.4 with fluids. The infiltrate in the LLL was
resolving per CXR on [**5-29**]. ENT felt that he was ready to be
extubated with anesthesia present in case of stridor. He was
attempted to be extubated twice but was unable to do so.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for thoracics surgery consult for
placement of a tracheostomy as he had been intubated for 7 days.

Imaging Studies:

CXR ([**5-29**]):
The OGT shows a normal course, the tube is visible distally into
the lower third of the esophagus. More distally, the tube is not
visible. The endotracheal tube also shows normal course, its tip
appears to project approximately 3.5 cm above the carina, the
definite tip position is difficult to determine because of
projection effects. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac
atelectasis. Suspicion of moderate left sided pleural effusion.
No evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No evidence of pneumothorax.

MRI Neck ([**5-30**]):
Diffuse oropharyngeal mucosal enhancement and subcutanous edema,
consistent with cellulitis with a 1.6 X 1.0 cm right mylohyoid
muscle collection and other smaller microabscesses. Incidental
note of partially imaged right pleural effusion.

CT [**2177-6-3**]
1. Abscess adjacent to the right mylohyoid muscle is not clearly
defined on this noncontrast study. Extensive edema centered in
the right submandibular space is similar to [**2177-5-30**].

2. Opacification and air-fluid levels in all sinuses may
represent sinusitis in the correct clinical context.

3. Borderline enlarged cervical nodes are likely reactive.

4. Saber sheath trachea, possibly secondary to collapse of the
tracheal
cartilage, as there is no evidence of COPD on CT chest performed
concurrently.

MRI [**2177-6-10**] (follow-up)
FINDINGS: Again soft tissue edema is identified in the right
side of the oro- and hypo-pharynx. A 14 x 11 mm hyperintense
area on T2-weighted images is seen in this region indicative of
a small fluid collection. Since the previous study, the
endotracheal tube has been removed and the soft tissue edema is
considerably decreased with slight decrease in size of a fluid
collection. No new fluid collections are seen in the neck. There
is no lymphadenopathy or new mass lesion identified. Soft tissue
changes are seen in both mastoid air cells.

IMPRESSION: Gadolinium-enhanced imaging could not be performed.
Compared to the previous MRI of [**2177-5-30**], there is considerable
decrease in swelling of the oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal
soft tissues with slight decrease in size of the previously
noted fluid collection. No significant new abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 73 yo man with history of obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who developed respiratory distress
and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection now transferred
to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
thoracics.

# Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  He received 7-days of broad
spectrum antibiotics at an outside hospital prior to transfer.
Per ENT notes his infection was improving. Although S. aureus
and Group A strep grew from culture data, the referring
hospital's ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial
infection that required broad spectrum coverage. From an ENT
stand point they had wanted to extubate him and were considering
changing him to oral antibiotics.  On admission to our hospital
and ICU, he was seen by ID who recommended continuing vancomycin
and Zosyn. Cultures were sent from sputum, ear discharge, blood
and urine. No microbe was isolated. An MRI of the neck
