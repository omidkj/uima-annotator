Date of Birth:  [**2085-4-21**]             Sex:   F

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarch [**2164-3-1**]

History of Present Illness:
78 yo F with HTN began to have URI-like symptoms approximately 2
weeks ago with runny nose, cough, but no fevers.  She
subsequently developed mild dyspnea both at rest and with
exertion that has persisted for the past two weeks. She
completed a Z-PAK earlier this week. Given her continued
complaints of dyspnea, her PCP referred her to an OSH ED to rule
of pulmonary embolism. CTA did not show a PE, but was notable
for a  6.7 x 7 x 13.9cm ascending aortic aneurysm.  She was
given IV lasix and propanolol and referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further management.
.
In the ED, she was evaluated by cardaic surgery recommendation
made for  initiation of beta-blockade for better BP control and
further evalaution of dyspnea. EKG showing AFIB of which she
denied any history. Vitals on transfer were 96.0, 115/77, 15,
99%RA. Symmetric BP noted in both arms.
.
She noted that she has not been able to lie flat cecause of SOB
for quite some time, usually sleeps on 3 pillows.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Physical Exam:
VS: T=98.2 BP=141/89 HR=90 RR=16  O2 sat=97%2l
GENERAL: NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with JVP 2cm above clavicle at 45 degrees.
CARDIAC: irregular,  S1/S2. early SM II/VI at RUSB, no diastolic
murmur, no r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.

ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+  DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+  DP 2+ PT 2+

Pertinent Results:
Carotid U/S:
Standard Report Carotid US

Study: Carotid Series Complete

Reason: 78 year old woman with aortic aneurysm, pre-op study.

Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On the right there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen
in the ICA. On the left there is mild homogeneous plaque seen in
the ICA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 46/27, 42/18,
43/23cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 43/23 cm/sec. ECA
peak systolic velocity is 55 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.06.
These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 44/18, 52/29, 58/29 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic velocity is 46/21 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is
57 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.26. These findings are
consistent with <40% stenosis.

Right antegrade vertebral artery flow.
Left antegrade vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
.
ECHO: Poor image quality. The left atrium is elongated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
severely dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Large ascending aortic aneurysm.
.
C cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrate no flow limiting lesions. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a 30% proximal tubular stenosis as
well as
a 30% mid vessel stenosis just after S2. The distal LAD wrapped
around
the apex of the heart. The Cx had a 30% proximal stenosis. The
Ramus
Intermedius was a largve vessel with mild plaquing throughout up
to 20%.
There was a hairpin turn present in the mid vessel. THe RCA gad
mild
plaquing throughout as well as a modest RPDA, a tortuous RPL1
and RPL2.
There was slow flow present in the LAD, Cx and RCA consistent
with
microvascular dysfunction.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left
sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 15 mmHg. The central aortic
pressure
was 152/100 mmHg. There was no transvalvular gradient on
pullback of the
catheter from the LV to the aorta.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries have no flow limiting lesions.
2. Mild left diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate systemic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2164-3-1**] Ms. [**First Name (Titles) 14675**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an ascending aorta and hemiarch
replacement performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see the
operative note for details.  She tolerated this procedure well
and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit. She was extubated and weaned from
pressors.  Her chest tubes were removed.  She was transferred to
the surgical step down floor and was seen in consultation by the
physical therapy service.  She was started on coumadin and
amiodarone for post-operative atrial fibrillation.  She was
noted to have acute renal injury (ATN) with creatinine up to 2.5
which improved to her baseline of 1.2 as lasix was decreased. By
post-operative day #8 she was ready for transfer to [**Hospital1 14676**] in [**Location (un) 4310**].
