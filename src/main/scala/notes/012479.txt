Fever, hypotension

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 951**] is a 62 year-old male with a history of aortic
coarctation status post homograft repair at age 13, recently
status post ascending to descending aorta bypass graft with 18
mm Gelweave [**2110-1-29**] complicated by sternal wound dehiscence and
graft infection (CNS, non-hemolytic streptococcus), RV
laceration requiring repair, VRE bacteremia, candidemia ([**3-26**]
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis), VAP (MRSA in sputum [**3-6**], then ESBL
Klebsiella and yeast), HIT, with two recent admissions for
fever, most recently discharged on [**2110-5-9**] following admission
for fever attributed to UTI (Pseudomonas at [**Hospital1 **]).
*
He now presents from [**Hospital3 105**] with a 2-day history of
recurrent fever while on Bactrim (for ESBL in sputum [**5-13**]),
Ciprofloxacin and Doxycycline suppressive therapy. Per nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 31242**], he was pancultured. This AM, he was tachycardic,
hypotensive (BP 70/44), and was given Vancomycin 1 gm IV and
Amikacin 450m mg IV X1. He was given about 2 L of IVF, and
started on Levophed for persistent hypotension. His Hct was also
23, but no transfusion was administered. Per nursing notes, ?
black stools. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further
care.
*
On ROS, patient reports abdominal pain. Review of records
reveals a KUB performed at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2110-5-14**] that revealed an
ileus, but no definite obstruction or free air was noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Sepsis:  Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and underwent
agressive fluid resuscitation.  He required pressor support with
levophed.  Patient has a very complicated history of multiple
infections by multiple organisms including MRSA, VRE, and ESBL
klebsiella.  He has a chronically infected intra-thoracic graft
for which he is on chronic suppressive therapy with doxycycline.
 He had a PICC line which was discontinued as a possible source
of infection.  Multiple cultures were sent, including blood,
urine, sputum, and the PICC tip.  Patient was started on
Linezolid and meropenem, and on HD#3, his blood cultures from
[**5-15**] drawn at [**Hospital3 105**] came back positive for ESBL
klebsiella.  A sputum culture from [**5-16**] from here grew resistant
Acinetobacter and ESBL Klebsiella.  IV Bactrim was added to help
cover the MDR Klebsiella and Acinetobacter.  Given his
complicated hx, ID was consulted to assist with management of
his chronic infections.  ID recommended continuing the
Linezolid, Bactrim IV, and Meropenem as we were doing, and
discontinuing the suppressive Doxycycline therapy.  ID
recommended draining R pleural effusion that was seen on a Chest
CT that had been obtained during this admission.  U/S guided
drainage of the effusion did not grow any bacteria, although
this was after 5 days of Abx therapy. Blood cx's drawn here
remained negative to date.  The left effusion was felt to be too
small to tap per IR.  In addition,
In summary, after speaking with our infectious disease
colleagues, they recommended the following.
1) Lifelong Linzeolid with weekly CBC monitoring
2) A total of 4 weeks of IV Bactrim; if patient remains stable
clinically, ok to d/c
3) Would continue the Meropenem for at least a month as well.
If able to d/c the Bactrim because of clinically stability, OK
to d/c Meropenem a few days afterward.  Would also consult ID at
[**Hospital1 **] on a as-needed basis.
.
2) Ventilator-dependence:
Given his lack of sternum, it was felt that likely would not be
able to wean off the ventilator.  Thoracic surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **]
and felt that the patient was not a candidate for further
surgical interventions for his ventral hernia or chronic
mediastinitis.  Patient was left on his settings as from OSH,
and he was transferred back to [**Hospital1 **] for long term vent
management.
*
3) Adrenal Insufficiency:
Patient with a hx of adrenal insufficiency and arrived on
chronic Hydrocort 25 mg PO qD.  He was placed on IV stress dose
steroids on arrival which were slowly tapered over the ten days
of his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission.  On discharge, his steroids were
converted back to his standing PO dose.
.
4) Anemia:
Anemia of chronic disease, hct at baseline (20-24).  Transfused
prn during this admission to maintain hct >21.
*
5) FEN:
Continued on TFs by PEG tube to maintain nutrition. He was
diuresed with lasix as needed.
*
5) Ppx: No heparin products given history of HIT. Pneumoboots.
