Allergies:
Zosyn / ceftriaxone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
slurred speech, left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation and removal

History of Present Illness:
64F with hx Multiple Sclerosis with chronic foley catheter, PVD,
diplegia of lower extremities, presenting with abrupt change in
mental status noted by staff at nursing home around 9am,
including increased slurred speech, L sided weakness today as
well as episode of emesis en route by EMS.  Patient had received
AM meds at nursing home, at which time she was noted to be at
baseline blood pressure and mental status.  Soon afterwards, she
complained to another staff member that she was hot and wanted a
drink; when nurse returned with a drink, she was more lethargic
with elevated BP 180/90. In the ambulance, patient was noted to
not be withdrawing to pain on the left side.

Of note, per nursing home staff, patient's foley [**Last Name (un) **] has been
changed about 3 times since [**2118-3-24**] because it has either fallen
our or was noted to have increased urine sediment.

In the ED, initial vs were: 101.9 92 152/72 16 100% 4L NC. Both
eyes were deviated downwards, and patient was not following any
commands.  She was agitated and had another episode of emesis in
the ED in setting of altered mental status.  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note, she
was noted to be 83% on ?room air, presenting with some
difficulty breathing. Patient was intubated for airway
protection with etomidate and succynlcholine, pretreated with
lidocaine 100mg x1 IV.  ETT was initially placed in Right
Mainstem Bronchus, pulled back about 4-5cm with bilateral breath
sounds noted on exam.  She dropped BPs initially on propofol, so
she was switched to midazolam and fentanyl for sedation.
Patient was previously DNR/DNI, but husband revoked this and
made her Full Code in the ED.  Code Stroke was called in the ED
at 12:45pm.  CTA and CT-perfusion unremarkable.  On Neurology
team exam post intubation, patient was moving all extremities.
She was noted to have significant UTI and was given a dose of IV
ciprofloxacin 500mg x1. Given fever and hx of UTIs, Neurology
team suspects that symptoms were secondary to UTI rather than a
central neurologic process.  Vitals in ED prior to ICU transfer
were as follows: 65  127/62  100% on AC FiO2 100%  RR 15  PEEP
5.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated and sedated,
appearing comfortable, unable to provide further history.
