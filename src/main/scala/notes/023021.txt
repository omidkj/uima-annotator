History of Present Illness:
57 y/o man with a history of aoritc valve replacement [**2102**] [**2-24**]
congenital bicuspid valve, copd, HTN, prior alcohol abuse, who
is admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU with dyspnea and transient
hypotension.
.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2110-1-28**] to
[**2110-2-2**] for dyspnea and was treated for a COPD excaerbation with
steroids and azithromycin. An echocardiogram performed during
the admission was normal, without significant impairment in
relaxation. He completed his course, but continued to have
symtpoms. In fact, VNA contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP (who had not yet met
him), on [**2-13**] with concerns that included continued dyspnea, a
reported 20lb weight gain, and lower extremity edema. The
patient began 20mg lasix at that time.
.
On presentation to his new PCPs office [**2110-2-21**], he had a
continued oxygen requirment of 3L at rest, sating 95% and 90%
with ambulation. The patient endorsed dyspnea walking even 30
feet. He was sent to the ED for a rule out of PE. per reports,
he was moving air well at that time and did not have wheezing.
He had just completed his prescribed steroid taper on [**2-19**] which
was a total of 14 days.
.
On arrival to the ED he was 96.9 124/59 91 24 95%on 3L
In the ED he was given lasix 40mg IV x 1 and a CTA was obtained.
The CTA was negatvie for PE. The lasix dropped his blood
pressure transiently to 75/40 which was response to a total of
2L normal saline challenge. He was not given steroids or
nebulizers. Despite resolution of his hypotension, he was sent
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Further review of systemts notable for minimal cough, no fever,
and no chest pain. He does not occasional paroxysmal abdominal
pain for which a RUQ u/s on [**1-28**] was negative for acute
pathology. He notes leg swelling, for which tight socks have
helped. He also reports difficulty sleeping, requiring 3 pillows
at night. He reports that he did not feel completely better
during his hospitlization at [**Hospital1 18**], notable that he did not try
and walk around much. He thinks that his shortness of breath has
been much worse since [**2109-12-23**], allthough clearly he must
have marked dysfunction given disability [**2-24**] dyspnea. Former
patient of [**Hospital1 2177**], and a comprehensive review of old records is not
available at this time.

[**2-21**] CXR: No evidence of congestive heart failure. Lung
hyperinflation. Questionable left hilar mass. Evaluation with CT
chest with contrast is recommended for precise characterization.


[**2-21**] CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolus, no evidence of aortic dissection.
2. Small nodular densities in left lower lobe, with secretions
in the
trachea, likely small foci of aspiration.
3. Emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 y/o man with long smokign history admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
makred dypnea and lower extremity swelling likely due to a COPD
exacerbation.

# Dyspnea: Likely COPD exacerbation with recent overall decline
given new O2 requirement this month. Also likely has an element
of OSA given his inability to sleep laying down (3-pillow
orthopnea) as COPD alone would not cause this.   CHF essentially
ruled out by normal BNP and hypotension after lasix.  Echo was
normal 2 weeks prior. Given wheezing and marked smoking history,
it seems that this is a continued presentation of a partially
treated, severe COPD exacerbation. PE was ruled out with CTA. He
was started on a prolonged prednisone taper: start at 60mg po
for 1 week and will be discharged on a slow taper.  He was also
restarted on advair, spiriva, singulair, and albuterol.   He
will need outpatient [**Hospital Unit Name 1570**] evaluation.  He is already scheduled in
pulmonary clinic for a complete evaluation.
.
# Likely obstructive sleep apnea:  Patient was tried on CPAP
overnight, and had one successful night, and a second without
relief.  His settings were 3 L of oxygen and pressure of 11 and
a formal sleep study for treatment of his suspected OSA.
.
# Lower Extremity Edema: Appears consistent with chronic venous
insufficiency, not CHF as above.  Could have some element of cor
pulmonale, but echo 2 weeks ago inconclusive though showed mild
RV dilation but no TR.  He was encouraged to wear compression
stockings and elevate his legs.  He was also continued on a
higher dose of lasix.
.
# RUQ abdominal pain: The patient has intermittent sharp, RUQ
abdominal pain as an outpatient and had an episode overnight
which resolved within 30 minutes.  Not related to food intake,
however the sharp quality and location raise concern for
cholecysistis.  Had a RUQ US recently which was unremarkable.
LFTs this revealed only a slightly elevated ALT. His repeat
abdominal ultrasound was negative for gall stones.  He will need
abdominal CT if the pain persists.  It was relieved with low
dose oxycodone, and he was discharged on percocet.
.
# Hypertension: The patient was continued on his home regimen of
lisinopril and extended release diltiazem.
