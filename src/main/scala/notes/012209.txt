Service: NSURG


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
gentleman who initially presented to the ER on [**2132-7-31**] with
one month history of lower extremity weakness, right greater
than left.  He stated that the weakness developed slowly, but
progressed to the point where he had difficulty climbing a
flight of stairs, or rising out of a chair.  He saw a
neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] approximately 1 week prior to
admission, and it was felt that the leg weakness was mostly
proximal and possibly related to statin use.  The patient was
asked to discontinue the medication at that time.  Of note,
CK at that time was normal.

He presented to the ED on [**2132-7-31**] for evaluation of his
lower extremity weakness and had not improved since his
office visit.  He was admitted to the Neurology Service.  He
was noted to have dysuria in the emergency room, and a Foley
catheter placement was attempted, but resulted in trauma with
bleeding of the urethra and Urology was consulted who
recommended continuous bladder irrigation.  Over the first 24
hours of hospitalization, the patient's blood pressure was
noted to drop from 160s/80 over 100 systolic, and he became
febrile at 101.2.  The patient also experienced increased
white blood cell count from 8 to 13 and an increased
creatinine of 1.7 to 2.4.  He was therefore transferred to
the Medical Service for further workup of fever and possible
sepsis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Right rotator cuff tear.
6. Transient ischemic attack.
7. Recent urinary tract infection treated with Bactrim.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature was 101.2 degrees,
heart rate 76, respiratory rate 18, BP was 88/40, currently
104/51, and saturation was 95 to 99 percent on room air.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  EOMs
full.  No nystagmus.  Neck was supple.  Chest was clear to
auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1
and S2.  No murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.
Extremities:  A 2 plus pitting edema of bilateral lower
extremities and 2 plus pedal pulses.  Neurologically, the
patient is alert, and oriented in all 3 spheres.  Answers
examiners questions appropriately.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are intact.  His motor strength, deltoids are 4 plus
bilaterally, biceps 5, triceps 5, wrist flexion 5, finger
flexion 5, interossei 5 on the right and 2 on the left,
quadriceps 5 on the right and 4 on the left, hamstrings 4
bilaterally, anterior tibialis 5 on the right and 4 on the
left, and gastrocnemius 5 on the right and 4 on the left.
Reflexes were 2 plus in the right side, 3 plus in the biceps,
triceps in the left and brachial radialis is 2, patellar 1,
on the left ankle was 1 on the left, and he had a positive
Babinski on the right and the left.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted initially to the
Neurology Service and then transferred to the Medicine
Service for workup of sepsis.  On [**2132-8-2**], the patient was
transferred to the ICU for decreasing neurologic status after
an MRI showed bilateral subdural hematoma with midline shift.
On [**2132-8-2**], the patient went to the OR, and had right burr
hole craniotomy with subdural drainage, and placement and
drainage of the subdural by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**].  There were no
intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively, the patient
was awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  He underwent right
parietal burr hole drainage of chronic subdural hematoma with
no intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively, he was
monitored in the ICU.  His vital signs were stable.  He was
awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  Speech was fluent.  EOMs
full.  Pupils of right 4 down to 3, left 3 down to 2.5.  His
upper extremity strength was 4 out of 5 in the left, 3 out of
5 in the lower extremity in the left, 5 and 5 out of 5 in the
right.  He was continued on Dilantin.  He had his JP drain
discontinued on [**2132-8-3**].  Head CT showed decreased right
subdural hematoma and stable left subdural hematoma.
Transferred to the regular floor on [**2132-8-4**] followed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy.  Continued to be
followed by Urology for hematuria.  The patient continued to
remain stable and continued to have some left-sided weakness.
Foley began draining clear yellow urine after several days of
irrigation.  The patient was sent for rehabilitation and
discharged to rehabilitation on [**2132-8-7**] in stable condition
and he is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in 2 weeks with a
repeat head CT.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Folic acid 1 p.o. q.d.
2. Insulin sliding scale.
3. Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q. 4h. p.r.n.
4. Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
5. Famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Dilantin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
