History of Present Illness:
57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
transferred from [**State 1727**] after being found unresponsive at home on
[**2169-3-7**]. She was found to be in acute hypercarbic and hypoxic
respiratory failure and was intubated on [**2169-3-7**]. She was
initially hypotensive, requiring fluid resuscitation and
pressors for the first 24 hours. She was found to have a
possible LLL pneumonia, received 10 days of moxifloxacin, as
well as empiric vancomycin for the first 4 days. On [**2169-3-17**] she
was diagnosed with a UTI, with culture pending, and was started
on ceftriaxone. Also had elevated transaminases in the 6000s
which gradually normalized, thought to be due to shock liver.
She had [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved after IVFs and was also felt to be
from low blood pressures. Per OSH records, she was "ruled in"
for NSTEMI--CK 368, trop (unclear if I or T) 0.54--with "limited
management" given her other critical issues. The patient's
hypercarbia and hypoxia quickly resolved with mechanical
ventilation. Her ET tube was withdrawn over bronchoscope on
[**2169-3-17**], but almost complete airway collapse was witnessed so she
remained intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. She had been receiving tube feeds and these have
been continued. By discharge from OSH, her labs were: WBC 15,
Hct 31, plts 125, Cr 1.1; ABG 7.45/35/83. CXR on [**2169-3-20**] showed
elevated R hemidiaphragm and bibasilar atelectasis. All cultures
have been negative to date.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was awake, alert, with ET tube in
but not connected to ventilator; patient was breathing room air.
Her vitals were stable, and patient denied any pain.
.
ROS: limited as patient was intubated
.

=================
IMAGING:
[**3-20**] MR HEAD:
1. No acute intracranial pathology. There are no imaging
findings to suggest
anoxic brain injury or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, although
given that the
possible anoxic brain injury event might have been a few weeks
ago, imaging
findings can be subtle in these cases.2. Nonspecific areas of
white matter signal abnormality may reflect the
sequela of chronic microangiopathy.
.
[**2169-3-20**] CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**2167-10-28**], the respiratory tube
tip
lies approximately 3 cm above the carina. Retrocardiac
opacification is
consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe in this
patient with low lung volumes. No definite vascular congestion
or acute focal pneumonia on this technically limited study.
.
[**2169-4-2**] CXR : As compared to the previous radiograph, the
monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
Tracheal wire stent is also unchanged.  Minimally increasing
left pleural effusion with minimal increase of left basal
opacity. Small area of either atelectasis or small intrafissural
effusion at the right lung base. No evidence of pneumothorax. No
other relevant changes.
.
[**2169-4-5**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to intermittent
sharp
waves in the L>R mid to posterior temporal regions suggestive of

cortical irritability and potential for epileptogenesis. The
background
rhythm is slow and disorganized consistent with a moderate
encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances and
infections are common causes. Anoxia is also a possible
etiology. If
still clinically indicated, would consider 24 hour continuous
EEG for
further evaluation of the above findings.
.
[**2169-4-6**] UE ULtrasound: Deep venous thrombosis of the left
subclavian, axillary, and basilic veins surrounding the left
PICC

.
[**2169-4-6**] CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Bilateral lower lobe
collapse with narrowing of left lower lobe and collapse of the
right lower lobe bronchus. Overall findings are probably due to
known tracheobronchomalacia and mucous secretion plugging.
Status post tracheostomy. Slight increase in mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.  Mild splenomegaly. Trace free air adjacent to
the gastrostomy, presumably related to recent
PEG placement.
.

[**2169-4-17**] CT Abdomen IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis with no signs of cholecystitis.
2. Limited study for evaluation of mass lesion due to lack of IV
contrast.
However, no definite liver lesion was visualized to explain the
transaminitis
on the non-contrast study.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Unchanged wedge compression deformity of the lower thoracic
vertebra
.
[**2169-4-19**] CXR:
CHEST, AP: Lung volumes are low, but stable. Increased linear
opacities at
the right lung base may represent atelectasis or consolidation.
Left lower
lobe atelectasis is unchanged. Tracheostomy and tracheal Y stent
are in
standard position. A right PICC again terminates in the right
atrium. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The
cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. IMPRESSION:
Increasing right basilar atelectasis or consolidation.
.
[**2169-4-23**] EKG - HR 80s. Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm with first
degree A-V block. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared
to the previous tracing of no diagnostic change. No QT
prolongation.
