Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted [**3-23**] following a negative urinalysis at
his PCP's office.  An ID consult was initiated and a repeat
complete ua and culture was negative.  He was therefore cleared
for surgery by ID.
On [**2162-3-24**] he proceede dto teh OR and underwent a redo
sternotomy, PVR, TV repair, ventricular outflow tract patch.
Please see op note for full details.
He had a tough post-op course with initial VTah off bypass and
vent arrythmia post-op.  he was also found to have hemiparesis
when first weening from sedation.  A neuro consult was obtained
with recs for head CT when stable.
On POD two a head CT demonstrated no infarct.
On POD three he was febrile and an ID consult was obtained while
he was continued on vanco, levo, and astreonam.
PODs [**3-22**] were significant for ongoing hemodynamic management in
the CSRU.  ID, neurology, and EP continued to follow pt.  Some
improvement in left sided weakness.
On POD 8 he proceeded to the cath lab for pacer placement.
On POD ten he was successfully weened and extubated.
On POD 15 Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to be febrile with rising WBC.
ID continued to follow pt with recs for checking blood cultures,
checking for C.diff., us bilateral legs, and restart
levofloxacin, aztreonam, and vanco.
POD 16 was significant for ongoing LE cellulitis for which a
derm consult was obtained.  They recommended increased dose of
topical steroids, [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings, leg elevation, and diuresis
with ongoing abx per ID and follow-up appointment outpatient.
The avscular surgery servoce was also consulted with very
similar recommendations.
POD 18 his amylase and lipase were found to be elevated and a
general surgery consult was obtained without much concern for
acute surgical issues.  Over the next several days his amylase
and lipase continued to trend upwards.  On POD 23, his
amiodarone, lipitor, and levo were discontinued -- general
surgery still had little concern for surgery with asymptomatic
pancreatitis.  On POD 25-26, his lipase/amylase were
significantly lower.
On POD 19 he proceeded to the cath lab for planned elective PCI
to the LAD.
On POD 21 it was felt that pt was stable for transfer out of the

treatment with increased physical therapy.
