Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22401**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for evaluation of elevated troponins, renal
failure and acidosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Echocardiogram
Cardiac catheterization- no obstructive CAD


History of Present Illness:
73M w/ history of HTN, type 2dm, hyperlipidemia, COPD and PVD,
initially admitted to OSH on [**4-10**] following reported respiratory
arrest after eating pizza now being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further evaluation of ventilator management, worsening renal
function, and elevated troponins.

History limited but initially admitted to OSH on [**4-10**] following
respiratory arrest after eating pizza. [**Month (only) 116**] have lost pulse
during initially during EMT evaluation and received CPR.
Transferred to OSH ED where was emergently intubated and noted
to have difficult airway. Was afebrile and hemodymically stable
at this point and initial ABG on 100% FiO2 was 7.38/43/541 and
CXR reported to be unrevealing for infiltrate. Initial labs
notable for wbc to 10.9 (w/o left shift) with crit of 35, a
creatinine of 2.1, with a CK of 656 and troponin of 0.02. ECG
with wavy baseline but no significant ischemic changes.

During ICU stay at OSH, was treated for presumed COPD
excerbation with steroids, nebulizers, and abx - Levaquin and
Linezolid. It appears that pt may have been taking oral
linezolid for cellulitis prior to admission. His insipired
oxygen was decreased to 0.30 and he continued to oxygenate well.
He was difficult to sedate and required escalating levels of
versed and fentanyl. It does appear that he developed a
worsening metabolic acidosis with last ABG on [**4-13**] 7.24/33/113.
Meanwhile, his creatinine was noted to increase from 2.1 at
admission to 2.5 at time of transfer with a bicarbonate of 17.
Labs also indicate less than ideal glucose, although hemoglobin
A1c was 6.8. Pt was noted to be fairly hypertensive and norvasc
initiated for control. Finally, on [**4-13**], ECG noted to have ST at
100 with new diffuse st depressions throughout precordium and
I/AVL/II/AVF. Troponin also noted to be elevated to 1.30
(unknown normals). Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

BRIEF HISTORY:   73 year old male with previous history of
diabetes,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for
non-ST elevation MI in the setting of acute respiratory failure
due to
COPD/asthma.  Previous echo demonstrated preserved LVEF with
moderate
aortic stenosis and calculated aortic valve area of 1.0 cm2.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class II,  stable.

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 6 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
 1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.  The
LMCA
showed no angiographically apparent stenoses.  The LAD showed no

significant stenoses. The LCX showed no significant stenoses.
The RCA
showed a mild 20% stenosis in its proximal segment without other

significant lesions.
 2. Hemodynamics demonstrated moderately to severely elevated
filling
pressures with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary
artery pressures were 70/30mmHg, with mean pulmonary capillary
wedge
pressure of 30mmHg and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
of
42mmHg.  Cardiac output was preserved at 2.5L/min/m2.  There was
no
mitral valve gradient.  The aortic valve showed a mean gradient
of
7mmHg, which is consistent with an aortic valve area of 1.8cm2,
which is
suggestive of minimal to mild aortic stenosis.  There was
moderate
systemic hypertension with blood pressures of 170/68.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Mild aortic stenosis.
3. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension
