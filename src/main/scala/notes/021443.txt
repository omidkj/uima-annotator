Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**]
Chief Complaint:
Speech difficulty and seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stereotactic brain biopsy


History of Present Illness:
73F with h/o breast CA who presented to OSH on [**2158-9-8**] with
sudden onset of difficulty speaking.  Head CT there showed some
effacement of left temporal and parietal lobes, suggestive of
MCA
occlusion per OSH radiology read.  She was transferred here to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, and en route, had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure,
which resolved within 1 min after Ativan was given.  She was
intubated here for airway protection.  OSH CT was reviewed with
[**Hospital1 18**] radiology, and there was concern that the findings could
in
fact be a left post-parietal area mass lesion, as opposed to
early infarct.  MRI was obtained here, which showed several
enhancing masses of L parietal lobe (mets vs. primary glial
tumor) and T2 hyperintensity of medial L temporal lobe (caused
by
seizure vs. involvement of glial tumor).  Consulted now for
evaluation of brain masses.  Per the pt's family, prior to this,
she has been very active, driving herself, and functionally
independent.


Past Medical History:
Breast CA, dx'd in [**2148**], s/p lumpectomy and chemo/radiation (in
remission per pt's family report), DM, Depression, L wrist
fracture 2 weeks ago.  No hx stroke, seizure, HTN,
hyperlipidemia

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-9-9**] 2:39 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Several oval 1 cm enhancing masses of the left parietal lobe
with surrounding T2 hyperintensity involving both the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and
white matter. This may represent primary glial tumor vs
metastasis.

2. T2 hyperintensity of the medial left temporal lobe without
abnormal enhancement. This may be related to the recent seizure
or may represent involvement by a glial tumor.

POST-OP CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-9-15**] 4:31 PM

IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative appearance of the brain
following stereotactic biopsy of the left frontoparietal mass.
No enlarged brain hematoma or mass effect seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **] was admitted to neurology ICU on [**2158-9-8**] for
workup of speech difficulty and new onset seizure. Her brain MRI
+/- gado showed left parietal and temporal lesion and she was
transferred to neurosurgery service and out of ICU to stepdown
on HOD#2. Her speech has improved significantly since she
started on decadron 4mg q6hrs. No recurrent seizure during her
hospitalization.

On [**9-15**] she underwent stereotactic brain biopsy, pathology
report - Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Her post-op recovery was
uneventful.

Physical therapy was consulted and recommended pt to be
discharged home.

Occupational therapy was consulted regarding fracture of
****right wrist/fingers*** and recommended outpatient OT/PT to
improve ROM.

Radiation oncology was consulted and recommended cyberknife
protocol, and family had decided to call brain tumor clinic on
[**2158-9-20**] for further planning.

Neuro oncology was consulted and family will make decision
[**2158-9-20**] regarding type of radiation and/or chemotherapy

During this admission, the patient's daughter reported family
issue that patient is unsafe to be discharged to home with
husband. Social worker has been working with the patient and
family, also contact[**Name (NI) **] elderly protective service which will
follow up on this issue within 5 days as of [**2158-9-19**]. Patient is
recommened to be discharged to her daughter's home until the
family issue is resolved.

Neuro exam on [**2158-9-19**] without any deficits. Upon discharge, the
patient is neurologically stable, on regular diabetic diet and
ambulating independently. She is discharged to her daughter's
home, and family will contact brain tumor clinic on [**2158-9-20**] for
further treatment planning.
