HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old man
with a known history of congestive heart failure secondary to
ischemic cardiomyopathy status post PTCA and CABG and EIV
pacer.  Patient has past medical history significant for type
2 diabetes and chronic renal failure.

Patient was in his usual state of health (stable NYHA Class
IIIb) until [**2151-10-26**]
when he underwent surgery for incarcerated ventral hernia.
He was D/C'd on Prandin 0.5 t.i.d. with meals.  On
[**2151-11-16**], the patient had an episode of hypoglycemia
requiring admission to [**Hospital3 **], and was D/C'd from [**Hospital3 9717**] off all glycemic agents.  Patient's PCP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**]
started Glipizide 2.5 for consistently elevated serum glucose
levels.

On date of admission, the patient awoke diaphoretic with
shortness of breath.  His finger glucose at that time was
measured to be 50.  In the [**Hospital1 188**] ED, he received 3 amps of D50 with symptomatic
improvement.  The patient was without chest pain, headache,
nausea, vomiting.  He did have increased shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for increased ascites over
the past five months with no pedal edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
4. PTCA and SVG to LAD on 10/[**2149**].
5. Status post CABG in [**2135**].
6. Type 2 diabetes.
7. Chronic renal failure.
8. Status post incarcerated ventral hernia and repair.
9. Status post biventricular pacer and ICD placement on
09/[**2151**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
2. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg q.d.
4. Lipitor 30 mg q.d.
5. Tylenol #3.
6. Toprol XL 100 mg q.d.
7. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Glipizide 2.5 mg q.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with diabetes and coronary artery
disease.  Father with coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol
consumption.  The patient lives with his wife and two
daughters.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  WBC 6.6, hematocrit 30.3, platelets
192.  Chem-7 is significant for hyponatremia and hypoglycemia
with sodium 129, potassium 4.7, chloride 95, bicarb 23, BUN
60, creatinine 1.6, and glucose 43.

Prior studies include an echocardiogram on [**2151-10-20**] showing
an ejection fraction of 15-20%, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation,
and dilated right ventricle.  ETT MIBI on [**4-/2151**] shows
moderate septal fixed defect, moderate inferior defect which
was reversible.

EKG was paced at 70 beats per minute.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally admitted to the
Medicine service with heart failure, Cardiology, and [**Last Name (un) **]
consults.  After much discussion, a consensus decision was
made to take the patient for cardiac catheterization with an
attempt to minimize contrast dye load.  It was also suggested
that the patient be started on milrinone given his
decompensated CHF at the time of admission.  Thus, the
patient was taken on milrinone for cardiac catheterization.

The findings were three vessel native coronary artery
disease.  Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular
dysfunction with elevated right and left sided filling
pressures and preserved cardiac index.  It was found that the
cardiac index, which was depressed, increased significantly
with milrinone.  There was total occlusion of the SVG to LCX
graft.  Total occlusion of the SVG to RCA graft.  There was a
patent SVG to LAD graft.  In addition, a patent LIMA to
diagonal graft. PA pressures were markedly elevated.

The patient was then admitted to the CCU for tailored CHF
therapy, and initiation of evaluation process for potential

and outputs as well as his daily standing weight was obtained.
The patient, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recommendations was started on
nateglinide for his management of his diabetes.  In addition,
a discussion for transplant was initiated with the patient and
family.  The patient also underwent precardiac
transplant testing
which included hepatitis, HIV, and CMV serologies.  Carotid
and abdominal ultrasounds.  Peripheral noninvasive studies
and pulmonary function tests.

The patient was carefully diuresed in the CCU.  A Swan
catheter had been placed for monitoring of the patient's
pulmonary artery pressures and hemodynamics.  On [**2151-12-2**],
the patient underwent biventricular lead placement through a
left thoracotomy for cardiac resynchronization therapy in
setting of chronic NYH  He tolerated this procedure well, and
[**Doctor Last Name **] of chronic NYHNYHA class IIIb status despite optimal drug
therapy. He was successfully extubated without
difficulty.  Patient was then transferred to the Medicine
floor and was seen by Physical
Therapy.  He reported some subjective improvement.
Physical Therapy was able to clear him for discharge home as
he was able to perform activities of daily living.

Upon discharge, extensive follow-up appointments were made
for the patient.  These included follow up with the Heart
Failure Clinic, Device Clinic, [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center, and
metabolic ETT appointment.  He was instructed to call the
Heart Failure program if his weight increased by more than 2
pounds or if he experienced any other worrisome symptoms.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. End-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. SP biventricular DDD pacer for cardiac resynchronization
therapy
Medications and addendum will be made with the patient's
medications on discharge.
