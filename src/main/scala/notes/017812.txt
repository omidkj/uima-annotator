Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
53yo F with diabetes type 1 c/b neuropathy w/chronic foley in

place, morbid obesity, wheelchair-bound, hypertension, coronary

artery disease s/p CABG, diastolic CHF, recent admission for
flash pulmonary edema, and sarcoidosis complicated by chronic
tracheostomy on 2.5 L/[**First Name3 (LF) **] trach collar at home who p/w shortness
of breath. The pt reports her sxs began abruptly this morning at
home. She noted shortness of breath with associated HA and
nausea (vomited several times) but no chest pain, palpitations,
fevers, chills, cough or wheezing. The pt presented to the ED
where initial vitals were HR 100, 181/105, 97% on 10L. She was
given morphine, Zofran, NTG and a single dose of Lasix.
Consideration to a CTA of the chest was made however the pt
declined because she did not feel she could lie flat and did not
want to be placed on a vent. She was then admitted to the MICU
for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo female with MMP admitted with increasing SOB and oxygen
requirement.



#Shortness of breath/Hypoxia: DDx includes dCHF in setting of
elevated BP, cardiac ischemia, PE or asthma/sarcoid flair. On
admission was satting adequately on 10L, however pt is at clear
risk for respiratory decompensation. In ED and on arrival to
MICU, importance of CTA was discussed with pt, however she
refused because she stated she could not tolerate the nausea
with IV contrast administration. She was admitted to the ICU for
further care. A heparin drip was started given suspicion of
pulmonary embolus vs cardiac ischemia. Patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction and lower extremity DVT's were ruled out
with bilateral ultrasound. Heparin was discontinued. No evidence
of fluid overload on clinical examination and shortness of
breath resolved without diuresis. Patient was discharged on home
dose of oxygen at 2.5L delivered by trach mask during the day
and 10L at night for comfort due to sleep apnea. The etiology of
these symptoms remains unclera, however they had completely
resolved with minimal intervention.

#HTN: Pt hypertensive at admission with systolic blood pressures
in the 180's yet is on a minimal antihypertensive regimen at
home. Attempt to gain better BP control with IV meds (hydral)
while uptitrating home regimen. Held [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of possible
CTA. Blood pressures remained low after hydralazine with
systolic pressures in the 90-110 range. All home meds were
reinitiated with BP's in the 110 systolic range.

#ARF: Pt with mildly elevated Cr from baseline (1.0->1.3) on
admission. Suspect pre-renal etiology given pt??????s nausea and poor
PO intake. Consider gentle hydration if no improvement, although
some reluctance to do this in setting of acute lung process.
Patient was given gentle fluid resuscitation and renal function
improved.


#Sarcoid: Pt may have sarcoid flair, although acute onset argues
against this. For now, continue home inhaled steroids and
bronchodilators.

#UTI:Patient has indwelling Foley for urinary retention with
frequent urinary tract infections with multi drug resistant
organisms in the past. She was initially started on zosyn and
the Foley was changed. Urine culture revealed similar resistance
profile to prior infections and she was started on macrobid once
renal function improved.
