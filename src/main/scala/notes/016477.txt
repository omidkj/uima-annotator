Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
Prebypass
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and lateral
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Postbypass
Improved wall motion in the lateral and somewhat in the inferior
wall. LVEF 50%. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at the
time of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2196-4-14**] where the patient underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to three vessels.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for invasive
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically itact and was extubated. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blockade was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] had some mild sternaL drainage and levfloxacin was
started. An ace inhibitor was also started given his ejection
fraction of 45%. By the time of discharge on postoperative day
five the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged home with physical therapy in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
