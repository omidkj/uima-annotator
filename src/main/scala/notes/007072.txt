Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 61 year old gentleman with a history of
active/untreated CLL/AML and disseminated fusarium on therapy
with ambisome and voriconazole admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-27**] with
fever and abdominal pain.
.
On presentation to the ED, initials vitals were 103.5 113 136/72
18 100% 4L Nasal Cannula. A CT scan of the abdomen was negative
and he was started on vancomycin and cefepime. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he
was switched to Daptomycin from Vanco due to his history of VRE
and also started on empiric C. Diff treatment with PO Vanco and
IV Flagyl as well as continued on his Fusarium treatment.
.
TTE showed a small effusion. CT Chest showed a bilateral,
moderate on the right and small to moderate on the left pleural
effusions, associated with bibasal consolidations. Repeat TTE on
[**7-29**] showed a stable effusion. Voriconazole and metronidazole
were discontinued. On [**7-30**] Daptomycin was also discontinued. He
was started on decitabine on [**7-30**].
.
Currently, he is resting comfortably. Denies chest pain or
shortness of breath. Denies abdominal pain, N/V/D.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologist History:
Biphenotypic Leukemia - Initially prsented with "autoimmune
pancytopenia" treated with steroids and IVIG. In [**3-/2157**] his
cytopenias worsened and he was noted to have about 90% blasts
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Preliminary bone marrow biopsy
was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia and therapy was
initiated with hyperCVAD. His day 14 marrow showed persistent
disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3. Day 14 and two
subsequent marrows all continued to show persistent involvement
with leukemia. Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to
have disseminated fusarium infection in the setting of prolonged
neutropenia. He was ultimately discharged on G-CSF and daily
Ambisome.

Other PMH:
Disseminated Fusarium - [**5-14**] - treated with Ambisome and
Voriconazole
h/o hepatitis B - on lamivudine
s/p appendectomy
s/p umbilical hernia repair

Social History:
Currently on disability. Wife is a retired physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
from [**Country 5976**]. Nonsmoker.


Family History:
One brother died of ALL.

IMAGING:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2157-7-27**] AT 18:01 HOURS.
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are profoundly diminished. There is
accentuation of
vascular markings and new bilateral pleural effusions and fluid
tracking
within the fissures. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
exaggerated by the low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax.
The osseous structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with apparent superimposed
interstitial edema.  Repeat radiography after appropriate
diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.

CT ABD PELVIS [**2157-7-27**]
1. Increased bilateral pleural effusions, new moderate
pericardial effusion,
and new small volume ascites, all suggestive of fluid overload.
2. No evidence of colitis, intra-abdominal abscess, or other
acute process toaccount for patient's pain and fever.
3. Stable splenomegaly and left renal cyst.

TTE [**2157-7-28**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the septum and mid-distal inferior/infero-lateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45
%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at least
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential but predominantly located along the
infero-lateral wall of the LV. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.

IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with mildly
depressed LVEF. Small-moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology. No evidence of
vegetations or abscesses.

ABDOMINAL US [**2157-7-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. No ascites.
4. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
5. No cholelithiasis.

CHEST CT [**2157-7-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate pericardial effusion. No definitive evidence of
tamponade
physiology, but correlation with echocardiography is required.
The amount of
effusion appears to be slightly increased even compared to prior
CT abdomen
from less than 24 hours ago.
2. Bilateral, moderate on the right and small to moderate on the
left pleural effusions, associated with bibasal consolidations
that potentially might represent atelectasis, although infection
cannot be entirely excluded. No focal consolidations within the
upper lobes of the lungs noted.
3. Severe splenomegaly.
4. Unchanged left renal cyst.

TTE [**2157-7-29**]
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). RV
with borderline normal free wall function. There is a small
pericardial effusion. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is
seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic invagination
consistent with elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-7-28**], no
major change (no RV diastolic collapse was seen on review of the
prior study).

IMPRESSION: Small, circumfirential pe
