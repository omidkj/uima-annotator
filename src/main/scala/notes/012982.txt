CT A/P ([**8-11**]): The lung bases demonstrate dependent atelectatic
changes bilaterally. More focal patchy consolidation at the left
base may
represent infection, however. Atherosclerotic calcification of
the coronary arteries are noted. There is no evidence for
pericardial or pleural effusion. The liver is diffusely
hypodense which may represent fatty infiltration. No focal
hepatic lesion is observed and there is no biliary ductal
dilatation. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The
spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete contrast normally and there is no
evidence of hydroureter or hydronephrosis. There are innumerable
hypodense renal cystic lesions bilaterally, many of which are
exophytic. The largest of these appear to represent simple
cysts. The pancreas demonstrates diffuse fatty atrophy. A G-tube
is present within the stomach and terminates near the gastric
antrum. Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable, though evaluation is limited without intraenteric
contrast. There is no free air or free fluid. No pathologically
enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are
identified. Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta
and its branches are observed though the aorta is of normal
caliber. The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable. The
bladder is collapsed. Multiple prosatic seeds are identified and
surgical clips are noted along the pelvic walls bilaterally. No
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are
identified. Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic
lesions. A small sclerotic lesion in the T12 ve
