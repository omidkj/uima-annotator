History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 69 year old male with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia and recently diagnosed RLL NSCLC
who initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**12-19**] with
a few episodes of teaspoon sized hemoptysis that resolved
quickly. He was admitted to the [**Hospital **] hospital from [**2140-12-24**] to
[**2140-12-26**] with recurrent hemoptysis and profound hypokalemia and
was treated briefly with potassium replacement and supportive
care.  He represented again from home on [**2140-12-27**] with recurrent
hemoptysis at home.  He was observed overnight in the CCU and
had no further episodes of hemoptysis on hospital day one and
was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  The patient
was taken to the [**Location (un) 538**] campus the morning of [**2140-12-28**] for
mapping for radiation therapy.  He had a
planning CT scan at that time which showed a mass vs. a clot in
the right bronchus intermedius.  He began to experience
hemoptysis again while traveling back from the [**Hospital 12162**] campus.  The
initial episode of hemoptysis lasted for approximately 20
minutes and he reports couging up bright blood and blood clots.
The medical team and MICU team was called to assess the patient
when he experienced a second episode of hemoptysis on arrival to
the floor- approximately [**12-14**] cup total of hemoptysis (bright
blood mixed with clots).  Patient's oxygenation saturations
stable on floor in high 80s to low 90s on 3 L nasal canula. He
had no documented hypotension during the acute episode of
hemoptysis and was transferred to the MICU for closer
observation. On [**2140-12-29**] he was transported back to the JP VA and
received one dose of paliative XRT.  In the early morning of
[**2140-12-30**] he suffered an acute STEMI with 12 lead EKG revealing ST
elevations in II, III and aVF.  This was associated with a
polymorphic VT arrest which decompensated to Vfib.   He was
shocked x 1 and went into sinus tachycardia for a few beats and
became asystolic.  He received atropine x 1 and then went into
atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates in the 190s to 200s for
which he received lopressor 5 IV x 3 and diltiazem 5 IV x 2 and
then a diltiazem drip.  He was given ASA 325 mg po, Beta Blocker
as above, Pravastatin 80 mg po for AMI.  He was also started on
an amiodarone drip for his arrythmia.  Cardiology was consulted
who recommended no further intervention. Per report, during the
code bright red blood was suctioned from the patient's mouth.
Following this event he was monitored closely.  He did not have
any further arrhythmias.  His respiratory status continued to
decompensate following his cardiac event.  Prior to his initial
presentation to the VA, he was breathing in the low 90s on room
air. During his VA admission, prior to cardiac arrest he was
breathing in low 90s on 3L and following the event he was
satting in the high 80s to low 90s on 100% NRB.  His CK MB
peaked at 170 and his MB-I at 22.4.  His troponins unfortunately
were not trended to peak but peak value noted was 6.14. On the
day PTA to [**Hospital1 18**], he was started on ceftriaxone out of concern
for pulmonary infection on [**2140-12-31**] with leukocytosis but no
fevers and no clear change in sputum production.  On the morning
of [**2141-1-1**] the patient was noted to have increasing oxygen
requirment.  Blood gas in the morning was 7.504/22.7/42.5 on
100% NRB. He had hemoptysis and was intubated for airway
protection.  Bronch was performed, and large clot was seen
obstructing R main stem bronchus.  Large clot was aspirated.
.
Per report, the patient's prognosis was discussed repeatedly
with the family and intubation was decisively not recommended by
the medical team.  The family persistently wanted everything to
be done and he was intubated.  Blood pressures post intubation
were in the 70s systolic which improved to mid 80s with fluid
boluses.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional
pulmonology evaluation and radiation therapy.

Admission CXR [**2141-1-1**](wet read):ETT is situated 6 cm above the
carina.  Right lower lobe density is visualized which probably
represents a combination of mass and some post-obstructive
atelectasis.  That appears to be subsegmental.  There is a
right effusion as well.  No pneumothorax and the remainder of
the lungs is clear.

MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is a 3-mm enhancing lesion within the
right frontal lobe cortex versus in a leptomeningeal location
within a sulcus without surrounding edema. No other areas of
pathologic enhancement are identified within the brain. There
are a few foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the
periventricular and subcortical white matter in the cerebral
hemispheres bilaterally, most suggestive of small vessel
ischemic disease in a patient of this age. There is no evidence
of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or territorial infarct. The major
intracranial flow voids are intact. A retention cyst is seen in
the left maxillary sinus measuring 2 cm. Scattered fluid versus
mucosal thickening is noted within ethmoid air cells. The signal
of the bone marrow appears normal.

IMPRESSION: Three-mm enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe
cortex versus in the adjacent leptomeninges. This is highly
suspicious for a metastatic focus. Findings discussed with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

ECHO
Conclusions
Subcostal views only obtained.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic
