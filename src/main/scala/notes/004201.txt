No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
lung nodules

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-12-1**]
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, left upper
lobe wedge resection (lingular wedge resection), and
mediastinal lymph node dissection

[**2162-12-2**]
Right chest tube thorocostomy for hemothorax


History of Present Illness:
67 year old female with two right apical lesions and one left
lingular lesion that have grown substantially in size over the
past year and were shown to be FDG avid on PET scan. Due to the
inconsistent growth rate of left lingula versus
right apical lesions, they are believed to be separate
processes. She is s/p mediastinoscopy complicated with
mediastinal hematoma s/p evacuation and electrocautery control
of a bleeding lymph node vessels as well as a right sided
hemothorax s/p pig tail placement and removal with pathology of
all lymph nodes negative for carcinoma.  Her right sided pleural
effusion is small and stable on chest radiograph from [**2162-11-29**]
following removal of the pig tail catheter.

Currently she states she is without any new symptoms.  She has
baseline SOB and wheezing consistent with her known emphysema.
She continues to complain of shortness of breath unchanged. Sent
on home oxygen but currently doesn't needed based on good o2
sats.  Mild cough in the morning.  Denies erythema around
mediastinoscopy site. Sore throat is intermittent. Hoarseness is
the same. No chest pain. Overall tired. Denies any headache,
weight change, or any new bony pain. No other complaints.

Past Medical History:
PMH: Breast Ca s/p lumpectomy and 35 rounds of radiation in
[**2138**], hypertension, tobacco abuse.

PSH: Mediastinoscopy and takeback for bleed [**2162-11-24**], lumpectomy

Pertinent Results:
[**2162-12-1**] Pathology
1.  Lingula, left, lingulectomy (A-E):
Squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, see synoptic
report.
2.  Lymph node, level 5, excision (F):
No malignancy identified.

[**2162-12-1**] CXR: New moderate enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette, mediastinal widening,  large right pleural effusion,
haziness of the hilar contours and vessels is consistent with
moderate pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe opacities are
consistent with atelectasis. There is a left apical chest tube.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

[**2162-12-2**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF ?60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are grossly normal. The aortic valve is not well seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.
IMPRESSION: very suboptimal image quality. Ventricular function
appears grossly preserved

[**2162-12-2**] EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. RSR' pattern in lead V1.
Within normal limits. Compared to tracing #1, except for the
decrease in rate, probably no other diagnostic interval change.

[**2162-12-2**] CXR: Comparison is made with prior study performed the
day earlier.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. Widened
mediastinum is unchanged. Large right pleural effusion with
adjacent atelectasis has increased. Left pneumothorax is very
small. Left chest tube is in place. Patient has known emphysema.
Mild vascular congestion has worsened. Left chest wall
subcutaneous catheter is new.

[**2162-12-2**] CTA Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary
embolism.  2. Moderate, nonhemorrhagic posteriorly layered right
pleural effusion with associated right lung atelectasis. 3.
Post-wedge resection changes in the left lung including small
loculated pneumothorax, minimal atelectasis of the left anterior
lung, subcutaneous air, and mediastinal hematoma. 4. Dominant
right lower lobe nodule is stable whereas a 11-mm spiculated
right upper lung nodule has been slowly increasing in size and
is concerning for neoplasia.

[**2162-12-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate left and mild right pleural
effusion with adjacent lung atelectasis is stable. No
pneumothorax.

[**2162-12-3**] CXR: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is again increased opacification in the left mid and lower
zones consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. The
right effusion appears less prominent, though this could relate
to patient position.
Left chest tube is in place and there is no definite
pneumothorax. Central
catheter again extends to the right atrium. Right chest tube is
also seen and there is no definite pneumothorax.

[**2162-12-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval repositioning of the right subclavian central line
which now has its tip in the mid-to-distal superior vena cava in
satisfactory position.  Right basilar and left apical chest
tubes remain unchanged in position.  Bibasilar opacities are
seen, with
