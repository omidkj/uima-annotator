Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
56 year old Portuguese male with 1 day history of chest pain and
dizziness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AVR(27mm valve) Homograft/Ascending aorta tube graft [**2105-12-8**]
Tracheostomy
Percutaneous feeding tube placement


History of Present Illness:
56 y.o. male, Portugese speaking, with history of AS/AI who
presented to an OSH with CP and dizziness after walking up a
[**Doctor Last Name **]. Pt reports that he had been experiencing chest pain with
heavy exertion for quite some time. Pt presented to [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital for evaluation. Per OSH records, the pt described the
pain as substernal in nature with radiation to the shoulders
R>L. Pt had subjective palpitations and dizziness with the pain
but no fevers, chills, diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting. On
arrival to the OSH, the pt's pain was relieved with tylenol.
However, he was found to have a fever of 101 so was admitted to
the ICU for further evaluation. On workup, pt's CXR was
significant for a sidened mediastinum with a tortuous aortic
shadow. CT with contrast revealed a ascending aortic aneurysm of
6.5 cm with a normal descending aorta. Pt was ruled out for MI.
Five sets of blood cultures were drawn. There was a concern for
endocarditis so the pt was started emperically on rocephin,
gentamicin, and nafcillin. The pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for CT surgical evaluation for repair of his aneurysm.

3. Right VP shunt s/p trauma approximately 30 years ago

Social History:
Pt is married and lives with his wife and children. He works as
a mechanic. He is Portugese speaking. No tobacco, ETOH, or
drugs.

Family History:
[**Name (NI) 1094**] father had DM. No history of CAD or hypercholesterolemia.

PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Endocarditis.  Evaluation for abscess.  Prosthetic
valve function.
BP (mm Hg): 105/85
HR (bpm): 85
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2105-12-28**] at 11:20
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full doppler and color doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2005W065-0:25

Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 60% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2105-12-21**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast in the
body of the
LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous
echo contrast
in the body of the RA. No mass or thrombus in the RA or RAA. A
catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and/or RV. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the
RAA. Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV
systolic function.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Normal AVR
leaflets. No masses or vegetations on aortic valve. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on
mitral valve. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. No mass or
vegetation on tricuspid valve.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient
was sedated for
the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information
section). Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine topical
spray. No TEE
related complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial
fibrillation. Compared
with the findings of the prior study, there has been no
significant change.
Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the
houseofficer
caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium or right atria.
2. A pacing wire is visualized in the right atrium and is free
of masses or
vegetations.
3. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and wall motion are normal.
5.The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in
diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
6. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic aortic
leaflets appear normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid
valve has no masses or vegetations.
8.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2105-12-21**] there
is no
diagnostic change.

CT HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2105-12-27**] 2:53 PM

CT HEAD W/ CONTRAST; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: needs IV contrast to identify signs of infection w/in
fronta
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57M s/p AVR, with persistent sepsis & CNS fluid collections
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
needs IV contrast to identify signs of infection w/in frontal
collections. last noncontrast study was inadequate
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Status-post aortic valve replacement with persistent
sepsis and CNS fluid collections.

COMPARISON: Same day approximately one (1) hour prior.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the head were obtained
following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray.

CT HEAD W/IV CONTRAST: No enhancing intracranial collections
identified. Again seen, are bifrontal chronic subdural
collections, unchanged. There is a ventricular drainage catheter
via the right posterior approach, unchanged in position. There
is no shift of normally midline structures. No enhancing masses
are seen. There is no hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of bifrontal chronic subdural
collections. No enhancing masses or enhancing collections
identified. Please note if meningeal infection is a concern, the
most sensitive test would be CSF analysis.





Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2105-11-22**].On [**2105-11-23**], the pt was
also noted to be in new onset atrial fibrillation. He was loaded
with 200 mg of amiodarone and started o
