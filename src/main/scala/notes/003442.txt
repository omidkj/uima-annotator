Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2962**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD Firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation


History of Present Illness:
67M PMH DCM--EF 25%, BiV-ICD implantation, who presents from
[**Hospital6 33**] with recurrent ICD firing. Apparently,
yesterday morning, the patient's ICD fired. He reportedly only
felt some SOB, but no CP other than when the ICD fired. Prior to
this event, he only noted a few occasional "extra beats." He
went in and saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45945**], who noted upon device
interrogation that the patient was being appropriately shocked
for VT. He adjusted the settings to attempt ATP for these
episodes. Later that evening, while the patient was watching TV
at home, when he received 4 shocks by his ICD. About an hour
prior to these episodes, he said he felt decreased appetite and
"not himself," consistent with symptoms he had prior to having
the ICD placed during VT. He denied any symptoms of SOB or CP
prior to these episodes. He was brought to [**Hospital1 34**] by EMS after
being started on a lidocaine gtt. CXR performed there showed
"worse congestion." The case was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
who recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Lidocaine gtt was d/c'd
there, and he was noted to have several runs of VT. Amiodarone
was bolused and then a drip was started, lasix 80mg IV was
given, and he was transferred here. According to EMS, on the way
here he had multiple runs and apparently was shocked at least
once.
.
While on the floor, he was noted to have several runs of NSVT,
during which he was less responsive, but did not receive any
shocks and was not unconscious. He was noted to have put out
615cc of urine since leaving [**Hospital1 34**].
.
Pt was admitted in [**1-7**] for VT ablation, and had no events
until [**Month (only) 404**], when he received a shock. He was started on
mexilitine by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45945**], and was without events until
mid-[**Month (only) 547**], when he was again shocked. No changes were made at
that time, and this was the last time he was shocked prior to
this event.

Pertinent Results:

Inferior-Right axis with RBBB morphology. Both at rates of
120-130.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: Continued runs of NSVT.

Radiology:
[**7-1**]: CXR: Moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure
[**7-4**]: CXR: Moderately-severe pulmonary edema has worsened and
severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased.
Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer,
defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective positions.
Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2172-7-3**]: Echo: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-10-28**] ,
left
ventricular systolic function appears similar. Mitral and
tricuspid
regurgitation is now more prominent. Estimated pulmonary artery
systolic
pressure is now higher.
.
[**7-10**]: LENIs: no dvt
.
[**7-12**]: CT Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffusely increased ground-glass opacity, throughout the
lungs. This is a nonspecific finding seen in many etiologies of
pneumonitis, but drug reaction, particularly with amiodarone
should be considered. Fibrotic changes at the lung apices could
also be related to amiodarone use, although they could also be
related to underlying chronic lung disease and mild
emphysematous changes. Although there is marked cardiomegaly,
the absence of pleural effusions and a significant amount of
interlobular septal thickening make pulmonary edema less likely.
Atypical infections, particularly viral infections should also
be considered.
3. Marked cardiomegaly and coronary artery calcifications.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
.
[**7-15**]: CXR: CHEST AP: There is stable mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly. Diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities are
not significantly changed from prior examination. No pleural
effusion is identified. Pacemaker/ICD leads are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Stable radiographic appearance of the chest with
diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities.
.
[**7-14**]: Echo: No definite atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers (however, image quality suboptimal).  The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. LV systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic  stenosis is not present. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.  Compared with the findings of the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-7-3**], the findings are
similar.
