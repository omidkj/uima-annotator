Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
RLE pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac and right lower extremity catheterization and

Right common femoral artery arteriotomy and embolectomy with
arteriotomy closure with saphenous vein patch.


History of Present Illness:
68M with h/o hypertension, symptomatic SVTs controlled on
metoprolol, EtOH abuse, 80 pack year smoking history, presented
to [**Location (un) 56335**] Comm. Hosp in [**Location (un) 3844**] yesterday morning with
RLE pain, numbness to the toes, parasthesias, and pale/[**Doctor Last Name 352**]
appearing leg.  He denies any hisotry of PAD, claudication, or
rest pain.  He had no palpable pulses upon arrival to ED and his
leg was cold.  Patient had no chest pain, SOB, or palpitations.
Initial ECG showed SVT to 180s, broke with adenosine and 25 mg
diltiazem.  Subsequent ECG showed concerning STe in V3/V4, Trop
was .06 (indeterminate).  He was started on a Heparin drip and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 97.4F 76/53, 84 16 96% on 2LNC.
Patient's pain was much improved.  ECG showed SR w/ RAD, < 0.5mm
STe V3-4 and new TwI in AVL, V2-6.  CT abd/pelv. with contrast
showed short segment occlusion of the right common femoral
artery but distally patent femorals. He was given 2L NS w/ SBP
increasing to mid 90s. He was continued on heparin gtt, received
Plavix 300mg, ASA 325mg, Levofloxacin 750mg, and zofran IV x1.
He was seen by vascular, felt to have acute RLE ischemia in
setting of "evolving MI", but since "the leg appears to be
improving clinically with the heparin drip...and foot does not
appear to be acutely threatened" recommended conservative
approach (heparin gtt).
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was afebrile with BP 98/60, HR
80, leg pain much improved.  He did not complain  of any chest
pain, SOB, palpitations.
.
On review of systems he reports chills. Pt denies any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism.
No excessive bleeding at the time of surgery.
No myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools.
.
Pt denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Pt denies exertional buttock or calf pain, although does not
exert himself normally.
.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

DISCHARGE LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the cardiac suite on [**2161-9-3**] to assess for
acute cardiac issues and was found to be negative for coronary
artery disease.  Cleared from a cardiac standpoint, he was taken
to the operating room on [**2161-9-4**] for a right common femoral
artery arteriotomy and embolectomy with arteriotomy closure with
saphenous vein
patch.  The operation proceeded without complication and Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was admitted to the floor thereafter.

His post-operative course was relatively uncomplicated.
Pertinent details, by system:

Neurologically, considering his heavy drinking history (up to 1
pint of hard liquor daily, as per patient and wife) he was put
on a [**Name (NI) 60563**] scale.  His vitals remained stable throughout his
hospitalization and showing only mild agitation which included
him attempting to climb out of bed at night in the first few
nights after his operation.  These episodes and his agitation
was treated at appropriate moments with ativan.  He was also
given a low-bed to prevent fall risk.  The [**Name (NI) 60563**] scale was
discontinued on POD 6 after several days of low score ratings,
no further episodes of agitation or acute symptoms of
withdrawal.

Cardiovascularly, he remained stable post-operatively.
Cardiology continued to follow his rythym abnormalities which
consisted of episodic runs of asymptomatic SVT.  They
recommended beta blocker therapy with metoprolol 25 mg daily.
He was also kept on heparin therapy post-operatively for a
bridge to coumadin.  This was eventually discontinued on POD 6
after TTE was negative for cardiac embolic source and patient
was deemed very high risk for anticoagulation therapy
considering his history of drinking and falls.  He was started
on high-dose aspirin daily.

From a rehabilitation standpoint, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was unsteady with
poor balance and a high fall risk during ambulation sessions
with physical therapy.  PT regarded it necessary for him to have
inpatient rehabilitation at a rehab hospital.  He was discharged
to rehab on POD 7 afebrile, vitals stable, in NAD, AAOx3 and
tolerating PO intake.
