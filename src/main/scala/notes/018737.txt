Pneumonia: Pt was treated empirically for CAP with levofloxacin

transferred to the MICU after an episode of hypoxia to 50% on RA
during chest PT.  Pt was placed on NRB with improvement of O2
Sat to 95%.  Sputum cultures were contaminated x 2 and thus
levofloxacin was continued.  Pt was continued on chest PT with

swallow for possible aspiration.  He was cleared by speech and
swallow, however pt may benefit from further work up with outpt
video swallow to evaluate for possible microaspiration.   Pt
should be continued on levofloxacin for a full 10 day course
