Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with a h/o symptomatic
bradycardia s/p recent pacemaker placement, COPD, A.fib on ASA,
vascular dementia who presented from rehab with a complaint of
worsening cough throughout the day, shortness of breath, chest
pain and increasing confusion per her home health aid. She
denied any n/v, diaphoresis. Upon arrival to the ER, her initial
VS were: 96.9, 100, 100/56, 18, 96%. CXR was done with no
evidence of infiltrate, EKG with A.fib in the 100's, however
given her symptoms she was empirically treated with ceftriaxone
and azithromycin. Later during her course in the ER she became
hypotensive with a temperature of 100, had a CTA that ruled out
a PE, at CT head that did not show an acute process, an
abdominal ultrasound was done that did not show any
intra-abdominal pathology, but did show a pericardial effusion.
As a result cardiology did a bedside echo, which showed a small
pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade. Blood and urine
cultures were also sent. She then had a right IJ placed for SBP
low of 65, and then persistent SBP's in the 70's, and was
started on levophed at 0.03, with an improvement in her blood
pressures to a systolic in the 100's. Her antibiotic coverage
was also broadened to vancomycin and zosyn. For fluid
resuscitation she received a total of 2LNS during her stay in
the ER.
.
On the floor, initial VS were: 98.3, 127, 128/55, 21, 95% on
3LNC. She is currently denying any pain, denies any CP, SOB,
n/v/d, dysuria, back pain or palpitations. She does say that she
continues to have a cough, that is sometimes productive. She was
oriented times [**2-16**], and somewhat lethargic, falling asleep
during the examination.
.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain a full ROS due to mental
status
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, congestion. Denies nausea, vomiting,
dysuria.

Studies:
[**2171-9-25**] CXR: Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.
.
[**2171-9-25**] CT Head W/Out Contrast: 1. No acute intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect. 2. Extensive encephalomalacia in the
right frontal and left parietal lobes,compatible with old
infarcts. Comparison with prior studies would be helpful. Given
the lack of priors and presence of pacemaker, consider followup
CT without and with contrast to exclude mass lesions
.
[**2171-9-25**] CTA Chest: 1. No acute pulmonary embolism or aortic
pathology. Small right-sided pleural effusion. 2. Severe
anterior wedge T6 compression fracture, chronic in appearance.
3. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
.
[**2171-9-26**] TTE: Small LV cavity size with mild symmetric LVH and
hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Mild resting LVOT gradient.
Probable diastolic dysfunction. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Calcified mitral and aortic valve. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
[**2171-9-29**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
and ventricular paced beat. Left axis deviation may be due to
left anterior fascicular block and/or possible prior inferior
myocardial infarction. ST-T wave changes are non-specific. Since
the previous tracing of [**2171-9-26**] atrial fibrillation has replaced
sinus tachycardia.
.
[**2171-10-2**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation and paced beats at 71 beats per
minute. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-9-29**] the patient
is now in a paced rhythm at 71 beats per minute. The atria
remain in fibrillation.
.
[**2171-10-2**] CXR: There is opacification at both bases consistent
with
moderate pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. Fullness
of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary
venous pressure in patient with some enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. Pacemaker device remains in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with h/o A.fib on ASA,
tachybrady syndrome s/p PPM placement, COPD, hypothyroid who
presented with hypotension, cough, chest pain and worsening
mental status. Her hospital course by problem is as follows:

# Hypotension: Patient was admitted to the medical intensive
care unit. She was initially started on levophed but weaned off
without difficulty shortly after admission.  Her stool was
guaiaic negative and transfusion was deferred as the patient was
asymptomatic from her anemia.  TSH and cortisol were within
normal limits.  She was ruled out for MI.  She did not appear
septic as there was no identifiable infectious source- blood and
urine cultures from [**9-25**] were negative. Blood cultures from [**9-29**]
and [**9-30**] were pending on discharge. While in the MICU, the
patient went into afib with tachycardia and developed transient
hypotension - possibly this was a contributing factor to her
initial presentation. There was no evidence of heart failure on
her initial CXR and no discrete cause for her hypotension on
ECHO.  Patient's hypotension was responsive to fluid boluses and
she was transferred to the floor where she did not require any
further pressure support or fluid boluses, maintaining pressures
in the 130s-140s.

# Shortness of Breath: Upon admission, patient was maintained on
O2 and nebulizers, and it as thought her symptoms were most
likely [**3-19**] volume overload.
