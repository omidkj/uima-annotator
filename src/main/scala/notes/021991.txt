Enalapril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, melena, hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transfusion 2u pRBC

History of Present Illness:
74 yo F with h/o atrial fibrillation on coumadin, s/p MVR, HTN,
PUD, and diverticulosis who presents with lethargy, melena,
blood oozing from her mouth and ? hematemesis. Per pt, has had
epigastric pain for several days and vomited up "small" amount
of dark colored blood for past 3 days. She later denies this and
states that she only vomited up dark blood on one occasion on
the day PTA. Per daughter, noted dried, dark blood around pt's
lips on Saturday. Denies hematochezia, BRBPR but does report one
episode of melena the night PTA. Per husband, he noted that pt
was much more fatigued and tired yesterday and was unable to
climb up a flight of stairs. He also noted "dark colored spots"
over her legs and arms and dark blood oozing from her mouth
after removing her dental plates. No coughing or vomiting up of
blood per husband. This morning, she was found to be very hard
to arouse from bed and again noticed dark, dried blood around
her mouth and clothes. Upon EMS arrival, FS reportedly wnl, BP
60/palp. She was given IVFs during transport to ED.
.
In the ED, initial BP 80/palp [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] RN. Given 500 cc bolus and
BPs improved to 103/56. She continued to be fluid resuscitated
with a total of 4L NS. NGL lavage performed with return of dark,
coffee-grounds. Labs significant for Hct 29.8 (baseline mid
30's), INR 21.2, venous lactate 10.7, Cr 3.6 (baseline 1.4 -
1.9), troponin 0.02, CK 81. The pt was given 2 units pRBC, 2
units FFP, panoprazole 40 mg IV X 1, and vit K 10 mg IV X 1.
Given elevated venous lactate, a CTA abd/pelvis was performed
that showed no signs of mesenteric ischemia, bibasilar lung
opacities, non-specific bilateral perinephric stranding possibly
related to renal failure, and ascites, pericholecystic fluid,
and RV enlargement suggestive of R sided heart failure. She was
seen by GI consult and admitted to the MICU for further care.

[**7-4**] CXR
SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There has been previous
sternotomy, with
midline sternal wires and prosthetic mitral valve again
identified. Marked
cardiomegaly is again noted with bilateral peripheral
interstitial opacities.
Findings may be related to chronic interstitial lung disease
though
superimposed mild congestion is also probable. There is no
pleural effusion.
The bony thorax is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Cardiomegaly with probable mild congestion.
.
[**7-4**] CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
2. New bilateral perinephric stranding, a nonspecific finding.
This may be
related to medical renal disease.
3. Reticulonodular opacities at the lung bases likely reflect
edema
superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease.
4. Cardiomegaly with right heart failure.
5. Small volume ascites.
.
[**7-4**] CT head
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage, allowing for the
presence of
intravenous contrast from the preceding abdominal/pelvic CT.
.
[**7-7**] CT head
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage or acute large
vascular territory
infarcts. Prominence of the ventricles slightly out of
proportion to
prominence of the sulci is unchanged compared to [**2146-7-4**].
Periventricular
hypodensities may represent chronic small vessel ischemic
disease,
transependymal migration of CSF, or a combination of the two;
comparison with
earlier prior imaging, if available, may be helpful in assessing
change over
time.
.
[**7-8**] CXR
The heart is enlarged. Mitral valve replacement is present. The
interstitial
failure present on the prior chest x-ray of [**7-7**] appears
less marked but
this could be due to technical differences and I suspect that
some
interstitial failure is still present. Atelect
