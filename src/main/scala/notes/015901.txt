Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: muscle weakness, hypotension, renal failure.
Reason for ICU Admission: hypotension with pressor requirement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-10-6**] Lumbar puncture
[**2154-10-17**]: Median sternotomy, open removal of old automated
implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads and removal of
automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
[**2154-10-21**]: Right Basilic Vaxcel PICC line 50 cm


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with history of arrhythmogenic
right ventricular dysplasia s/p ICD placement, complicated by
ICD pocket infection (MSSA) s/p removal and reimplantation in
[**Month (only) 547**] of this year, who is admitted to the ICU for hypotension.

Per patient, he was in his usual state of health until six days
prior to admission, when he developed sore throat, subjective
fever, muscle weakness, and headache. He went to see his primary
care physician who diagnosed him with likely flu-like illness.
Patient then began to feel better for 1 to 2 days. However,
three days prior to admission, he awoke feeling profoundly weak
in both his arms and his legs, hardly able to get out of bed. He
also endores muscle pain at this time, and he noticed that his
urine was darker. He may have had some mild dysuria at this
time. Thinking that the symptoms were part of the flu-like
illness, he remained at home for two days before presenting to
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital, one day prior to admission.

At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, he was found to be hypotensive with blood
pressure of 70/40 with lactate of 3.4 and new acute renal
failure. He was fluid resuscitated, a right IJ was placed, and
he was started on Levophed. Labs showed a positive urinalysis,
so he receieved one dose of Zosyn and then was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T 98, HR 66, BP 100/57, RR 18,
sat 96% on 2L nasal cannula. Exam was notable for hyporeflexia
at the patellar and achilles reflexes, with significant upper
and lower extremity motor weakness. Sensation was intact.
Patient with no other focal complaints for infection. His labs
were notable for lactate of 3.2 and creatinine of 5.4 (up from
baseline 1.0), ALT and AST of 47 and 55, with TBili of 6.7
(predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia), albumin of 2.7 and
INR of 1.2. His platelets were 63 and hematocrit was 37.9
(hematocrit was at baseline, platelets were down from ~200
previously). Differential revealed occasional schistocytes.
Notably, CK was normal. There was concern of GBS as well as
TTP-HUS, and both neurology and hematology were contact[**Name (NI) **].
Neurology has preliminarily recommended lumbar puncture for
diagnosis of progressive peripheral neuropathy. Hematology will
take a look at the peripheral smear, although they felt that
TTP-HUS was unliklely given the normal LDH. Patient then
underwent RUQ ultrasound that showed no acute right upper
quadrant process, and CXR with no acute infiltrate. He was
continued on norepinephrine drip and was admitted to the ICU for
further treatment.

Review of systems: currently, patient endorses muscle weakness
in his legs and his arms; the weakness does not spare his distal
muscle groups. He denies respiratory complaints. He denies
gastrointestinal complaints. His headache has resolved. He
denies nausea or vomiting. With respect to infectious risk
factors, he lives on [**Hospital3 **], plays golf and is frequently
outdoors, although he denies known tic bites. There is recent
travel history to [**Country 6607**] and no sick contacts at home.

Past Medical History:
-Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia c/b sustained
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, s/p single chamber ICD in
[**2139**]
-ICD Hx:
[**2139**]: Initial single chamber device placement at [**Hospital 71571**]
Hospital in [**State 18250**] in [**2139**]. The following month his lead
dislodged resulting in inappropriate ICD therapy. The lead was
removed with a new ventricular lead.
[**2145**]: Generator change for depleted ICD battery. Developed
insulator breech on this lead in [**2146**], necessitating lead
revision. Old lead was capped and abandoned at that time.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2139**]: Diagnostic. Per
patient, coronary arteries were clean.
-Hypertension


Social History:
Patient lives in [**Hospital3 **] with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] is a consultant for
mid-sized companies. He has two children. Remote history of
smoking, quit in [**2116**]. Drinks two glasses of wine/night. Denies
illicit drugs

Family History:
Sister: ARVD as well and has an ICD in place. Father also has
disorder, never had ICD in place. He died at 82 d/t CHF. There
is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or
sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: afebrile, BP: 113/69, P: 61, R: 24 O2: 97% 2L
General: well-appearing man, no acute distress
Neurological: patient able to lift arms and legs against gravity
but not against force; hand grip and intrinsic finger muscles
are weak in proporation to proximal muscle weakness; reflexes
are absent at the patella and
HEENT: subtle sclear icterus, pupils equal and reactive
Neck: supple, RIJ in place without evidence of infection
Lungs: clear bilaterally anterior fields
Cardiovascular: RRR, normal s1/s2, no murmurs; area over right
chest over ICD is intact, non-erythematous, not tender and not
warm
Abdomen: soft, non-tender
Genitourinary: foley catheter in place, draining dark urine
Extremities: without rashes, warm, well perfused, non-edematous

Imaging Data:

Liver/gallbladder ultrasound ([**10-6**]): No acute right upper
quadrant process detected. Small gallbladder polyp. The study
and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Abdominal ultrasound ([**10-6**]):
1. Splenomegaly (17 cm).
2. No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones bilaterally.
3. 2.1 cm hypoechoic lesion at the left kidney, likely
representing a cyst.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**10-7**]): The left atrium is mildly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic and mitral leaflet thickening, but no
focal vegetations or pathologic valvular regurgitation. Normal
