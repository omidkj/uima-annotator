Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
Paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
83 y.o. male with h/o CHF EF = 40% (RV hypokinesis), CAD, PAF,
HTN, AICD placement and recent admission to [**Last Name (un) **] VA ([**8-/2155**]
for CHF exacerbation) who present with increasing dyspnea on
exertion. Patient is a poor historian and thus most of the
history is obtained from his PCP who knows him well. Per PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] now has worsened edema and renal fxn. Patient was
referred by VRN service which stated that Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is unsafe at
home. Apparently, there is some indication of illicit activities
taking place there. He has had 3 VA admissions since this [**Month (only) 116**]
(and a stay at [**Hospital3 **]). Has responded well to diuresis
for volume overload previously. He was admitted to the floor
with COPD exacerbation vs. CHF. His BNP came back high >20,000.
CXR showed LLL pneumonia and mild CHF. He was treated with
aggressive diureses with Lasix 100 mg IV bid with Metolazone
without good response in urine output.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam on discharge

T:98.1   BP:110-130/60-80    P: 70s-80s   RR:16-20 O2 sats: 94%
on RA
Gen: Obese male sitting up in a chair . NAD.
HEENT: NCAT Oropharynx clear
Neck: Difficult to assess for JVD due to large neck
CV: +s1+s2 distant heart sounds
Resp: decreased breath sounds at bases with scattered crackles -
this is his baseline as per attending.
Abd: Distended and taut (baseline for him). There is no rebound
tenderness. No pain on deep palpation. No fluid wave. Ventral
hernia.
Ext: 2+ pretibial edema [**1-9**]+ ankle edema; has not rescinded
despite very aggressive diuresis.
Neuro: Alert and oriented. Conversant.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**9-10**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is an large (3x 3 cm) globular inferobasal
left ventricular aneurysm. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity
is markedly dilated. There is moderate global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial
effusion.
.
CXR: [**10-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Probable left lower lobe pneumonia with mild
congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly.
.
CXR: [**2155-10-7**]:
The heart remains markedly enlarged. A left-sided permanent
pacer is in place connected to a single intracavitary electrode
with two local enforcements representing an ICD device. The
pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution
pattern, but there is no conclusive evidence for interstitial or
alveolar edema. On the frontal view, the lateral pleural sinuses
are free; however, the lateral view discloses moderate degree of
blunting of the pleural sinuses indicative of mild-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions. The previously described
obliteration of the left-sided diaphragmatic contour consistent
with either left lower lobe atelectasis and/or pleural effusion
remains rather unchanged in comparison with the next preceding
portable examination of [**10-2**]. Observe that all preceding
chest examinations were obtained in portable AP single view
technique and no lateral views were ever obtained. Thus
comparison of the amount of pleural effusion accumulating in the
posterior sinuses cannot be evaluated and compared. Furthermore,
it may be pointed out that pleural effusions related to CHF may
take several days to disappear and may still be present as an
episode of acute CHF that has been treated successfully.
.
[**2155-10-10**]:CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No acute
intracranial hemorrhage is identified. There is diffuse
prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with
involutional change. Focal area of hypodensity within the right
cerebellar hemisphere likely represents a prior infarct. There
is additional focal hypodensity within the right occipital lobe,
also possibly indicative of prior infarct. There is diffuse
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic change. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation appears preserved, without evidence
of acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture in the
surrounding osseous structures. The mastoid air cells and
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are normally
pneumatized.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic change, involutional change of
the brain, and prior infarcts within the right cerebellar
hemisphere and right occipital lobe.
3. If evaluation for acute ischemia is of concern, MR is a more
sensitive test.
.
[**2155-10-16**]: RUQ US:
DOPPLER STUDIES OF THE LIVER: Doppler studies performed of the
liver vasculature. The hepatic veins are patent, widened,
demonstrate normal waveforms. The portal vein and its main
branches are patent, and demonstrate normal centripetal flow.
The portal waveforms are pulsatile, consistent with right heart
failure.
IMPRESSION:
1. Ascites.
2. Patent hepatic veins. Patent portal veins, with centripetal
flow.
3. A 6 mm simple liver cyst.
.
[**10-23**]: Abdominal Films:
SUPINE AND ERECT ABDOMEN: There is a nonspecific abdominal bowel
gas pattern with no evidence of acute obstruction. No evidence
of free air. Degenerative changes in the visualized spine.
Limited views of the lower chest demonstrate a pacer lead
terminating within the region of the right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute obstruction.
.
[**2155-10-5**]: ECG
Atrial fibrillation
IV conduction defect
Consider possible inferior infarct - age undetermined
Possible anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined
Lateral T wave changes are nonspecific
No change from previous
