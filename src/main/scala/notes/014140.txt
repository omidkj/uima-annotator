Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11344**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 55 M w/ hx GM seizures (followed by [**Hospital1 2025**] seizure service
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] at [**Hospital1 18**]), OSA, mental retardation p/w
typical seizure at home [**4-8**] at night and was taken to [**Location (un) 620**].
History is obtained from mother and chart. Per the mother the
patient has been well as of late. No recent complaints of
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He has been eating
well and taking his meds as instructed. This AM his mother heard
his foot banging against the wall and found him seizing with
eyes deviated to the right. His last seizure was about 4 months
ago. She called EMS. En route to [**Location (un) 620**], he was given valium
10mg, this aborted the seizure. He got an additional 5mg of
valium at [**Location (un) 620**]. On presentation to [**Location (un) 620**], was hypotensive
to SBP 90's and peripheral dopamine was initiated and also found
to have a trop of 0.4. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care. In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, still required dopamine. Also found to have
CHF on CXR, ? bilateral opacities, and was given levofloxain for
possible PNA.
.
On arrival to the MICU he was quite agitated. Asking the staff
to leave him alone. Denied any specific pain at this time.


Past Medical History:
1. seizures since age 4 years
2. h/o meningitis as an infant
3. OSA
4. mental retardation
5. hyponatremia, baseline serum sodium ranges 128-133
6. s/p transoral biopsy of right anterior tonsillar pillar ulcer
in [**12-25**]; pathology consistent with acute and chronic
inflammation


Social History:
The pt lives in a group home.  He smokes one pack of cigarettes
per day x roughly 30 years.  There is no history of alcohol or
illicit drug use.


Family History:
No other family members with seizures.

Physical Exam:
T 96.1 BP 97/76 HR 98 RR 18 O2sats 100% RA
Gen: Agitated, not answering questions or following directions
Heent: PERRL, anicteric, mmm
Neck: EJ on right side, no obvious JVD
Heart: RRR, no m/r/g
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at the bases with faint crackles,
otherwise good air movement
Abd: Soft, NT, ND + BS, no HSM
Ext: No edema, extremities are warm with 1+ DP/PT pulses
Neuro: Currently lethargic and unable to do exam as patient not
following commands. He does move all 4 extremities to pain.


Pertinent Results:
Chest X-ray on [**2143-4-9**]:
SINGLE AP UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been
resolution of mild interstitial edema, however bibasilar
consolidations persist and are
suspicious for pneumonia.  No sizeable pleural effusions and no
pneumothorax seen.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
normal.
IMPRESSION:  Improved volume status.  Persistent bibasilar
opacities
are concerning for pneumonia.

Echocardiogram on [**2143-4-9**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. A 2x1.5cm echogenic "mass" is
seen within  the wall of the right atrium c/w ? Hematoma vs.
intramural thrombus.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is  moderately dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the
inferior,  inferolateral and anterolateral walls. The remaining
segments contract well.  No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Transmitral and tissue  Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic function, and a normal left  ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is focal basal right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation.  The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral  regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.  There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with extensive
regional left  and right ventricular systolic dysfunction
suggestive of multivessel coronary  artery disease. Right atrial
wall thickening as described above.  If clinically indicated, a
chest CT may be able to better derine the  abnormality of the
right atrial free wall.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 year-old male with history of mental retardation, grand mal
seizures who presented with typical seizure, hypotension and
elevated troponin.
.
# Hypotension - Patient's normal systolic blood pressure around
120's. Presented to outside hospital with seizure, given valium
and then noted to be hypotensive requiring dopamine. Also noted
to have troponin leak of 0.4 and possible new CHF on CXR. Here,
ECHO showed evidence of global cardiac hypokinesis. Decreased EF
potentially contributing. Less likely ACS with downtrending
enzymes, asymptomatic, minimal ECG changes. Potential infectious
contribution with evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray. Also
potentially adrenally insufficient. However, lactate normal and
patient making excellent UOP (actually negative since
admission).  Hypotension could be due to excessive UOP from DI,
central salt wasting. Patient was successfully weaned off
dopamine drip.  Patient has low sodium but is high for his
normal range. No signs of bleeding and Hct stable. Patient
mentating well. He was given IVF boluses with goal of keeping
euglycemic. Patient was continued on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin
for 14 day course to cover for pneumonia. No growth to date on
blood cultures and negative urine cultures x2. Most likely
etiology of his hypotension from PO valium given for his
seizures given rapid resolution and negative lactate.
.
# Troponin leak - Pt with no recent chest pain, but had non
specific TW flattening in the lateral leads. Both CPK and trop
were elevated initially but CPKs could be elevated in setting of
seizure and all enzymes now trending down. Troponin leak likely
due to catecholamine [**Doctor First Name **] in setting of prolonged seizure,
although literature not consistent w/ troponin elevation in
seizure. Mother [**Name (NI) 382**] declined central line and cardiac
catherization at this time.  Per cardiology, held off on heparin
gtt or lovenox given downtrending cardiac enzymes. Patient was
continued on aspirin and plavix was discontinued. Followed
serial EKGs.  Patient will follow-up with Cardiology as an
outpatient and get an outpatient ECHO in [**4-26**] weeks and a cardiac
MRI.  He was also instructed to avoid QT prolonging medications
as this interval was borderline high on this admission.  Given
his depressed ejection fraction of 35% he would also likely
benefit from initiation of a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor once
he is further out from this episode of hypotension.
.
# pneumonia: patient had evidence of pneumonia on CXR. Afebrile
but elevated WBC. Potentially secondary to aspiration during
seizure vs. prior aspiration event. Initially started on
levo/flagyl now stopped because both lower seizure threshold.
Continued ceftriaxone and clindamycin as above.  Followed up
sputum/blood cultures.
.
# [**Name (NI) **] Pt with stable anti-epileptic regimen. Per discussion
with his mother as been taking his meds as prescribed. Given
extra dose of dilantin with low level yesterday. Neurology
evaluated and notes that patient at baseline. This am dilantin
and depakote levels in ideal range.  Continued dilantin and
depakote.  Diazepam PRN for seizures.  Magnesium repletion
keeping >2.  Follow-up appointment with his outpatient
neurologist was scheduled.
.
# [**Name (NI) 4964**] Pt with volume overload on initial CXR per radiology
however BNP <5 and repeat CXR had no further evidence of CHF
despite decreased EF on ECHO. Satting well on room air at 99%.
Well compensated currently. If needed can give lasix but held
for now.  Will need to follow weight as an outpatient and
reassess in follow-up regarding ability to maintain fluid
balance.  Advised a low sodium diet (2g) a
