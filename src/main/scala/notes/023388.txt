Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial flutter ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Atrial Flutter Ablation
Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 66 year-old male with pmh of DM, COPD, obesity,
and atrial flutter admitted from EP lab s/p atrial flutter
ablation complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure after inital
extubation.
.
Per OMR documentation, the patient had initially presented with
dyspnea on exertion in [**Month (only) 1096**] and was found to have atrial
flutter. He underwent an elective atrial flutter ablation today
and was initially extubated, however he was unable to lay flat,
became tachpneic and was eventually reintubated. He also had
hypotension (thought to be related to sedation) and was on ***
for pressure support. He was given 20 mg of IV lasix for
possible volume overload. CXR showed no evidence of pulmonary
edema, however did have changes at the lung bases concerning for
atelectasis versus aspiration.
.
Unable to obtain review of systems as the patient is intubated.

[**2200-2-14**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Right
ventricle with borderline normal free wall function. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There
is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the left atrium/left atrial appendage or
right atrium/right atrial appendage. Mildly reduced
biventricular systolic function in the setting of tachycardia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 66 year-old male with DM, COPD, obesity, and
atrial flutter admitted from EP lab s/p atrial flutter ablation
complicated by respiratory failure after inital extubation.
.
# Respiratory failure/COPD: The patient was unable to lay flat
after his initial extubation. He was reintubated due to hypoxia
and agitation. The patient has known COPD, however he does not
sound wheezy on exam. He was treated with 20 mg IV lasix in the
PACU, however he does not appear volume overloaded on exam.  He
was hypercarbic while intubated in the CCU.  To optimize
respiratory status, further IV duiresis was done given that he
had a positive fluid balance after the ablation procedure.  In
esscence, he had acute on chronic systolic CHF.  On hospital day
2, the patient self-extubated secondary to agitation.  He was
placed on a non-rebreather and Bipap, and his ABGs were
monitored closely.  These slowly improved with nebulizer
treatments and the patient did not require a 2nd re-intubation.
He was discharged on a prednisone taper.

# RHYTHM: The patient was in atrial flutter previously, and
after his ablation he remained in sinus rhythm.  However, after
self-extubation, he did have several hours of atrial
fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.  He was
continued on his home dosing of warfarin and was therapeutic on
his INRs.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**],
You were admitted to the hospital after a procedure to ablate
the tissue in your heart causing your atrial flutter. There was
difficulty taking you off the ventilator after the procedure and
you were admitted to the CCU.  It is likely that your COPD may
be causing your respiratory symptoms. You were examined by
pulmonary and they recommended a short course of PO steroids
over the next five days. If your symptoms do not improve, or
worsen, please contact your primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will
need a chest x-ray in [**4-1**] weeks to make sure your lungs look
better. You will need your INR checked in the next week. Please
contact your primary care physician to set this up.

The following medications were started:
- Prednisone 50mg (5 tabs) x1 days then 30mg (3 tabs) x 2 days
then 10mg (1 tab) x2 days by mouth
- Flovent inhaler 220mcg 1 puff by mouth twice a day - please
use this until your follow up appointment with pulmonary
medicine
Please discontinue the diltiazem 30mg by mouth twice a day. You
should continue your long acting diltiazem 180mg daily.

Please be sure to keep all of your fo
