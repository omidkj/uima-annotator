Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an
83-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was
admitted to an outside hospital on [**2101-10-23**] with the
diagnosis of pyelonephritis and developed hypoxia, was
intubated, sustained a non-Q wave MI in the setting of
urosepsis and was transferred for interventional cardiac
catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**].  She initially presented to the
outside hospital with complaints of left flank pain and was
found to have a low blood pressure of 99/53 and a positive
urine culture for E. coli.  The patient was afebrile.

After transfer to the floor, the patient developed dyspnea
and tachycardia and was found to be hypoxic on 100%
nonrebreather.  The patient was intubated, received an
echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 20% and
found to have an increased troponin of 6.2 and CPK of 250.
The patient became hypotensive at the outside hospital ICU
and was started on dopamine, Neo-Synephrine, IV Lasix, IV
heparin, IV Integrelin.  The patient had a CT which ruled out
PE, but later chest x-ray showed multilobar pneumonia.  Renal
ultrasound was negative.  The patient was started on multiple
antibiotics at the outside hospital including levofloxacin,
cefuroxime, Cefazolin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
4.  Osteoporosis.
5.  Kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Synthroid.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
3.  Miacalcin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature 98.4, temperature maximum 98.9, pulse 92-106,
blood pressure 99/51, respirations 24, pulse oximetry 96% on
40% 02.  Ventilator settings:  Pressure support [**10-8**], tidal
volume 400, respiratory rate 25, FI02 0.4.  The ABG was 7.44,
35, 74, 40% on 02.  The AA gradient was 167.45.  Drips,
dopamine 2 micrograms per kilogram per minute; heparin 1,100
units per hour.  In general, the patient was an elderly
intubated female who appears comfortable.  HEENT:
Extraocular movements intact.  The pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light.  The neck revealed no JVD, no carotid
bruits.  Cardiovascular:  Soft, S1, S2, no murmur
appreciated.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nondistended, nontender,
normal abdominal bowel sounds.  Pulmonary:  Clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Extremities:  There were [**1-5**] DPs
bilaterally, 1/2 PTs bilaterally, feet warm.  Neurological:
Alert and able to follow commands.

INITIAL LABORATORY RESULTS:  White blood cell count 25.4,
hematocrit 37.2, platelets 277,000, 88.5% neutrophils, 8.1%
lymphocytes.  INR was 1.4.  PTT 57.8.  Chem-7 revealed a
sodium of 143, potassium 3.0, chloride 105, bicarbonate 24,
BUN 34, creatinine 1.5, glucose 227, anion gap 14, ALT 24,
AST 70, CK 255, alkaline phosphatase 105, amylase 62, total
bilirubin 0.7, albumin 3.0.  Urine creatinine 72, sodium 32,
potassium 52.  Initial CPK 255, CK MB 36, MB fraction 14.1,
troponin greater than 50.

Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram done revealed an ejection
fraction of 20-25%, severe left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, akinesis of the distal one-half of the anterior
septum, apex, and distal anterior inferior wall.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is an 83-year-old female with a
history of hypothyroidism and hypotension who initially
presented to an outside hospital with pyelonephritis who
later became hypoxic, found to have multilobar pneumonia and
ruled in for MI, non-Q wave by cardiac enzymes.  The patient
required intubation and pressors and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was hypotensive and
tachycardiac, evidence of pneumonia on CT scan, evidence of
UTI on urine culture.  The patient was thought to have
probable urosepsis.  The outside hospital was called.  Blood
cultures done there were positive for E. coli which was
pansensitive.

The patient received intravenous fluids for hypotension and
was gradually weaned off dopamine.  The patient was started
initially on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone to treat underlying
infections empirically but was switched to just levofloxacin
once outside hospital blood cultures were known.  The patient
had subsequent blood and urine cultures during the hospital
course that had no growth.  The patient was afebrile by the
time of discharge.  The patient is to have a full ten day
course of levofloxacin.  The last day of levofloxacin on
[**2101-11-11**].

2.  CARDIAC:  A)  Pump:  The patient had severe left
ventricular dysfunction, EF 20% and a rule in for a non-Q
wave MI.  The MI is probably in the setting of sepsis due to
the heart not being able to keep up with increased demand.  A
poor ejection fraction on the echocardiogram may be
situational in sepsis and should be repeated when the patient
is out of the hospital for a couple of weeks at least.  The
patient was maintained on pressor support to keep a MAP above
60 with dopamine and Vasopressin.  The patient was gradually
able to be weaned off these medications.

As the hospital course progressed, the patient became
hypertensive and gradually ACE inhibitor, nitrates, and beta
blocker were started and titrated up as the patient
tolerated.  The patient had several episodes of flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension.  Future
hypertensive events were controlled with Lasix and beta
blocker ACE inhibitors.

B)  Rhythm:  The patient had right bundle branch block with
left anterior hemiblock which was reportedly old and had been
there for several years.  The patient had no other ectopy
during the hospital course while on telemetry.

C)  Coronary:  The patient was with a non-Q wave MI.  The
patient had a cardiac catheterization done once the urosepsis
picture had cleared.  Cardiac catheterization revealed LV
ejection fraction of 46%, hypokinesis of the anterolateral
and apical portions of the heart, normal mitral valve, normal
aortic valve, 60% stenosis of the proximal RCA, 50% stenosis
of the mid RCA, 80% stenosis of the mid LAD, 50% stenosis of
the distal LAD, 40% stenosis of the proximal circumflex
artery.

The stenosis in the mid LAD was crossed with a wire and
ballooned and stented with two stents.  Resting hemodynamics
showed mildly elevated right and left heart filling
pressures.  The patient was started on Plavix and aspirin
after her catheterization with stent placement.  The patient
should be on Plavix for at least 30 days since the stent
placement which was [**2101-11-7**].

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was presenting with multilobar
pneumonia.  Sputum was sent for Gram's stain and culture.
Respiratory culture was negative, but the patient had
received doses of levofloxacin before this was sent.  The
patient was successfully weaned off her ventilator within two
days and gradually weaned off of all oxygen requirements.

4.  RENAL:  BUN and creatinine stable at all times.

5.  LINES:  The patient had a subclavian triple-lumen placed
and a left wrist arterial line.  These were placed and taken
out without complication.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
4.  Status post stent placement to mid left anterior
descending artery.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Hypotension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metoprolol XL 150 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Losartan 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Synthroid 100 micrograms p.o. q.d.
9.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. on [**2101-11-11**] and then stop.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA and PT services.  The
patient was instructed to take daily weights and report them
to PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will receive a call from Dr.[**Name (NI) 10427**]
office, her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] an appointment.  The patient is to
follow-up with Cardiology with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1026**] [**Name (STitle) 1016**] on [**2101-11-15**]
