HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, dilated
cardiomyopathy, bradycardia status post pacemaker placement
in [**6-/2184**] and history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The
patient presented with a two-week history of nonproductive
cough.  The patient denied dizziness, light headedness,
fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other URI
symptoms.  She stated that she had had two days of nausea,
but no vomiting.  She went to her primary care physician's
office on the day of admission, where she was discovered to
be in rapid atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of
greater than 150.  Chest x-ray was performed, which was read
as negative.  The patient was advised to come to the
emergency department.  Upon arrival, the heart rate was 90
and the blood pressure was in the 100s/60s.  In the emergency
department she was given Lopressor IV, with subsequent
returned to a regular paced rate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Coronary artery disease with no previous cardiac
catheterization information.
3.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.

5.  Stroke in [**6-/2184**] with residual memory loss and
word- finding deficit.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Macular degeneration.
8.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
9.  Status post bilateral cataract surgery.
10. Arthritis.

1.  Lasix 200 mg p.o.q.o.d.
2.  Elavil 10 mg p.o.q.h.s.
3.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.
4.  Accupril 5 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Multivitamins.
7.  Ocuvite.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied alcohol, tobacco, and
drug use.  The patient lives in [**Hospital1 **] with her son.  a

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission showed a white count of
10.6, hematocrit 35.9, platelet count 335,000.  Chem 7 was
141, 3.9, 102, 29, 27, 1.1, and 127.  Chest x-ray showed no
congestive heart failure and no infiltrate.  The first EKG
showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response
at a rate of 101; right bundle branch block; left anterior
hemiblock; and lateral ischemia versus artifact.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8.  Pulse between 90
and 167.  Blood pressure 108/58.  Respiratory rate 14 and 97%
on room air.  GENERAL:  The patient is alert, pleasant, and
elderly in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils surgical.
Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx clear, neck
supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No jugulovenous distention.
PULMONARY:  Examination revealed bibasilar crackles,
otherwise, clear.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Examination was regular
with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.  GI:  Soft,
nontender, and nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema; 2+ dorsalis
pedis and radial pulses bilaterally.  NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination revealed the patient alert and oriented times
two.  The patient was confused about the date.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for rate control
of her atrial fibrillation and echocardiogram was planned for
the following morning.  The patient's heart rate was easily
controlled with IV Lopressor in the emergency department and
continued p.o. Lopressor on the floor.  Echocardiogram, on
the day after admission, showed an ejection fraction of 30%
to 35%; moderate left atrial and right atrial enlargement;
left ventricular hypertrophy; multiple wall-motion
abnormalities; mild aortic insufficiency; mild-to-moderate
mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Myocardial infarction was ruled by serial enzymes.

On the morning of [**2184-11-26**], the patient was found down in
her bathroom and she had had approximately 600 cc of bright
red blood per rectum.  The systolic blood pressure fell to
the 70s.  She was given blood and IV fluids emergently and
was transferred to the MICU.  In the MICU, nasogastric lavage
was performed, which was negative.  The patient continued to
have rectal bleeding and required a total of 12 units of
packed red blood cells and also briefly required pressors.
The patient was too unstable to have a bleeding scan, so the
bleeding source was localized by interventional radiology to
the hepatic flexure.  The bleeding stopped before
embolization could be performed.  Interventional radiology
left an intrasuperior mesenteric artery catheter and
Vasopressin was infused for a planned six-hour duration; 1.5
hours prior to the plan, discontinuation of the Vasopressin,
the patient removed the groin catheter.  The rate of the
patient's rectal bleeding decreased on [**11-27**], and by
the 4th it appeared to have stopped.  The hematocrit was
stable at approximately 29.  All the blood products, which
the patient received caused some mild congestive heart
failure and the patient was gently diuresed.  The patient was
then transferred back to the medical floor.

On the day after transfer back to the medical floor, the
patient had one further episode of bleeding per rectum with a
bowel movement.  The hematocrit, however, remained stable at
approximately 29.  The patient was tolerating a regular diet
at discharge.

During the last few days on the medical floor, the patient
had several episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.  Most of
these episodes resolved spontaneously without intervention.
The patient's Lopressor was restarted and titrated up during
this time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
2.  Multivitamin one p.o.q.d.
3.  Zantac 150 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d. Monday through Friday.
5.  Elavil 10 mg p.o.q.h.s.
6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.o.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable for discharge
to a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Lower GI bleed.
