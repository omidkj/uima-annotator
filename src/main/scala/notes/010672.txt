Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
Enterocutaneous fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2168-5-17**]: ex-lap, LOA, repair gastrotomy, take-down ECF;
ileo-colonic anastomosis, repair sigmoid perforation
[**2168-5-30**]: repair gastric perforation and gastric bleed

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68F who underwent coronary artery bypass graft
in [**2167-5-21**]. Her hospital course was long and complicated by
multiple chest re-explorations and washouts for bleeding. The
patient developed small bowel obstruction related to ischemic
stricture that required ex-lap and bowel resection. Her hospital
course was further complicated by an open abdomen and
enterocutaneous fistula. The patient is now approximately 9
months out for undergoing exploratory laparotomy and distal
small bowel resection for an ischemic stricture leading to a
complete small bowel obstruction.  Her postoperative course was
complicated by development of enterocutaneous fistula which has
been managed conservatively over the last 9 months as she
recovered from her acute event.  Unfortunately, we were unable
to get satisfactory control of the enterocutaneous fistula and
she was having significant skin breakdown. Additionally, she was
unable to take oral intake due to increase in the fistula output
and was maintained on parenteral nutrition. She satisfactorily
healed from the initial surgery, and is now taken to the
operating room for take down of the fistula.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2168-5-17**], at which
time an exploratory laparotomy, take down of enterocutaneous
fistula, resection of small bowel and colon,
repair of sigmoid colotomy and repair of gastrotomy, and ventral
hernia repair with Marlex mesh were performed. In the operating
room, she required 3 u pRBC and pressors, and was taken to the
surgical ICU post-operatively intubated.

While in the ICU, she had improved uop; TPN; echo improved;
fever 101 w/thick sputum, she was pan cultured. She was weaned
off her dobutamine and started on dapto. She was extubated on
[**2168-5-20**] and off pressors. She diuresed 1L negative, continued on
TPN, and started on zosyn. her PICC and a-line was discontinued
on [**5-22**]. Her sputum cultures grew staph and pseudomonas. She was
up and out of bed that day as well.

She was transferred to floor on POD 6. Abdominal wound opened
while in the SICU [**12-23**] erythema, with negative Wound Cx. VAC
placed POD6 to abdominal wound. The left JP was removed on POD9
for low output. Right JP removed POD10 for low output. A
flexiseal rectal tube was placed on POD7 given increased BMs,
and CDiff x 3 were sent and were all negative. The patient was
began on TF through her G-tube on [**2168-5-25**], and slowly advanced.
Nutrition service was consulted, and she worked with physical
therapy.

On [**5-28**], tube feeds were seen coming out of the upper part of the
surgical wound and on [**5-29**] a large amount of blood was found to
be coming through the ostomy site and she was transferred to the
TSICU. Was taken back to the operating room on [**5-30**] for repair
of gastric perforation. A drain was placed near the perforation.
She was transferred back to TICU post op. Tracheostomy was
performed. Her hct remained stable but her VAC had high
abdominal output on [**2168-6-1**]. Her ASA and plavix were
discontinued due to oozing from her wounds. On [**6-3**], her VAC was
changed for leakage and it was replaced. She was febrile to 102
that day and cultures were sent. She was restarted on her ASA
and plavix and a CT abd/pelvis was obtained due to her fevers.
ID was consulted and her linezolid was changed to vancomycin.
She had multiple cultures showing pseudomonas in her sputum and
she had MRSA. She was switched from zosyn to ceftaz. She was
transferred from the TSICU to SICU on [**6-8**] and continued to
spike fevers and remained tachycardic. On [**6-10**] chronic pain
service was consulted and she was started on a dilaudid drip.
She was started on inhaled tobramycin on [**6-12**] but that was soon
discontinued due to minimal response. A family discussion took
place on [**6-15**] and a decision was made to place Ms. [**Known lastname **] on CMO
status. She was transferred out of the ICU to the floor on [**6-17**]
and remained on morphine with valium and ativan prn, this was
then changed to dilaudid drip. She was transferred to
