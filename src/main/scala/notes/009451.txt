History of Present Illness:
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Known lastname 1124**] is an 82 YOF with a PMH significant for aggressive
metestatic breast cancer to liver, lymph nodes, and possibly
lung metastasis recently started on xeloda ([**2168-2-19**]) who has
been declining over the past few weeks with increased fatigue,
decreased PO, and weight loss, as well as ascites requiring Q 2
week paracentesis.  She was in her normal state of health until
last night when she had brown emesis x 2.  Early the morning of
[**2168-3-4**] she had emesis again and was dizzy and weak on her way
back from the bathroom.  Her daughter helped her to bed and
noted she was tachypneic so she called her brother who is a MD
and then ended up calling EMS.  When they arrived they noted her
O2 sats were in the 70s.  They brought her to [**Hospital3 **].
.
Of note, on [**2-19**] pt underwent paracentesis which revealed 145
WBC.  per OMR, on [**2-25**] Dr. [**Name (NI) **] documented that there was
1 positive ascitic fluid culture (coag negative staph) with plan
to monitor for possible evidence of infection and treat with
antibiotics if indicated.  The day prior to her presentation she
reportedly was feeling well.
.
At the OSH the patient had CXR and CT scan which revealed "acute
on chronic" PEs and probable aspiration PNA.  Hct 39.1 and many
bacteria and WBC on UA.  She was not started on heparin gtt
given concern for GI bleed with hemetemesis.  She was given
clindamycin and levoquin, 2 L IVF and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
where here care is.
.
In the ED, patient was found to be in respiratory distress with
tachypnea 36 and O2 sats 94% on NRB. Initially patient was DNI,
but conversation was held w/ oncologist, daughter, and son (on
phone) about end of life issues and per son, pt wanted to pursue
aggressive treatment so she was made full code. She was
intubated, R IJ placed, given 4 L NS, OG tube placed and
returned 600 cc of dark coffee grounds.  GI was called to see
her and recommended urgent EGD for risk assessment of starting
anticoagulation. CT scan showed large amount of stool in the
[**Hospital1 499**], mult liver mets, ascites, obscure known pulm lesions, but
no other pathology.  Pt was given vanc, Zosyn, and started on
levophed gtt.  Labs were significant for WBC 14, 25% bands, Hct
34.2 (down from 37), INR 1.3, elevated AST 120, trop 0.07,
lactate 2.2.  UA showed 20 WBC, 50 RBC, few bacteria, lg blood,
nitrite neg, mod leuks.  Urine and blood cultures were obtained.
 ABG 7.48/33/84.
.
On the floor in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was sedated and intuibated
and unable to answer ROS.  She had her right IJ pulled halfway
out and was not receiving her levophed gtt.  Her BP was in the
50s systolic.  She was started on vasopressin then levophed
peripherally until central access was reestablished.  She had
her right IJ replaced.  Her ventilator was set at Assist
Control, Fi)2 100%, 500 by 16.

2. Metestatic breast cancer - diagnosed [**2167-11-30**] after RUQ
U/S was obtained for abd pain and slight elevated LFTs, and pt
found to have lesions.  MRI confirmed new liver lesions in
addition to those that were previously seen on MRI in [**2166**] and
thought to be hemangiomas.  Biopsy [**2168-1-26**] revealed metastases
c/w the patient's previously resected breast primary, which was
strongly positive for estrogen receptor. [**2-12**] she underwent
brain MRI and PET-CT
which showed no evidence of brain metastasis, but multiple bone,
liver, lymph nodes and possibly lung metastasis.
3. Sarcoid with substantial parenchymal disease
radiographically, but had problems in the past tolerating
prednison so was followed twice yearly by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] twice a
year.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1124**] was an 82 YOF with aggressive newly recurrent breast
cancer who was initially transferred from OSH were she presented
with hematemesis and respiratory distress and was found to have
acute on chronic PE, likely aspiration pneumonia and UTI. On
admission to our ICU Pnt was intubated and sedated for resp
distress and  pressors were started for shock. Her hospital
course was complicated by septic and cardiogenic shock,
respiratory failure, GI bleeding and paroxismal atrial
fibrilation. On the evening of [**3-12**] after meeting with patient??????s
family, due to the patient??????s poor prognosis and the perceived
futility of further medical intervention and in accordance with
the wishes of the patient??????s HCP and family members patient??????s
goals of care were changed to CMO. She was subsequently
