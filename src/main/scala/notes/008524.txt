History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with a h/o CAD (s/p 3 NSEMI's medically managed), RV
failure/pHTN with preserved LVEF 50-55%, diastolic dysfunction,
moderate MR and severe TR, HTN, HL, AFib on Coumadin, PVD (L

common iliac/external iliac [**6-/2199**]), CKD, colon ca s/p resection
in the 80's and chronic GIB, who presented from cardiology
clinic today with increase in heart failure symptoms.
.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] have been uptitrating his outpt Lasix
regimen which the pt reports compliance with. He was recently on
Metolazone however this was stopped due to concern for rash and
increase in eosinophilia.
.
The pt endorses what sounds to be NYHA class IV heart failure
symptoms with SOB with very minimal exertion including getting
up to go to the bathroom. He is unable to walk at baseline and
only gets up from the bed to his wheelchair to get around. He
and his daughter endorse increased swelling everywhere in his
body including his abdomen, which he notes is distended more
than usual.
.
In the ED, he was noted to have increased WOB, tachypnic. 98.2
102   151/76   24   100%. Labs significant for Hct 27.9 (lower
than baseline), Cr 2.2 (baseline likely in the mid 1's but
appear to have been steadily rising over past year). BNP [**Numeric Identifier 78766**],
Trop 0.07 (CK and MB pending), lactate 2.4.
.
Was briefly started on BiPAP but is off by time he gets to the
CCU. Started on Nitro gtt, currently running. He got 40 mg IV
Lasix, ASA 325 PR x1.
.
No clear precipitant to this exacerbation, other than stopped
Metolazone recently. He endorses med compliance. No CP or pain
elsewhere. He describes baseline orthopnea and sleeps with a
couple pillows. Denies PND, but says he gets up a lot in the
middle of the night to go urinate. He has an off/on cough with
baseline phlegm production.
.
Otherwise, no f/c/ns, vision changes, n/v/d/c, abdominal pain,
dysuria, or any other symptoms for other organ systems.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with a h/o CAD (s/p 3 NSEMI's medically managed), RV
failure/pHTN with preserved LVEF 50-55%, diastolic dysfunction,
moderate MR and severe TR, HTN, HL, AFib on Coumadin, PVD (L
iliac thrombus s/p embolectomy, c/b dissection/stenting of L
common iliac/external iliac [**6-/2199**]), CKD, colon ca s/p resection
in the 80's and chronic GIB, who presented from cardiology
clinic today with increase in heart failure symptoms.
.
1. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Pt with low-normal
EF 50-55% on last echo [**3-/2201**] with evidence of R sided heart
failure and moderate MR, severe TR, and moderate-severe pulm
HTN. His heart failure is likely multifactorial from valvular
disease, diastolic impairment, and possibly a component of
primary pulmonary disease/HTN. Atrial fibrillation also likely
contributing.
.
Patient was started on Lasix gtt and aldactone.  He diuresed
well. He was continued on hydral/nitrate for afterload
reduction.  His home metoprolol was switched to carvedilol and
clonidine patch changed to po.  Lasix and aldactone were
subsequently transitioned to po torsemide and patient was near
euvolemic on discharge.
.
2. Chronic renal failure: Creatine remained stable between
2.1-2.5.
.
3. AFib: Patient remained rate controlled and continued on his
Coumadin.
.
4. CAD: He was continued on his statin, hydral, imdur, and
aspirin.  His clonidine patch was switched to po to be ultimated
titrated down, and metoprolol switched to carvedilol.
.
5. Anemia: Patient's hct slowly trended down from 27 to 23.  He
has a history of GI bleed, and on admission was guaic positive.
He was transfused one unit pRBC.  Patient will need to follow up
with GI.
