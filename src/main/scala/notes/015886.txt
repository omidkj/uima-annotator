Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is a  80 yo F with a hx of COPD and
lung CA s/p resection/chemo/radiation presenting with fevers,
leukocytosis, increased SOB, and productive cough suggestive of
PNA
.
# Resp Distress: Fever to 103.6, hx of worsening productive
cough, and leukocytosis highly suggestive of PNA in this elderly
female with severe underlying lung dz. That said, imaging
relatively unimpressive. Pt improved with nebs. Lasix given
emprirically given poor lung exam although fluid overload not
evident on exam or imaging.
- started empiric treatment of PNA with vanco/zosyn/azithro;
with pending Cx of blood and sputum; once ctxs unremarkable,
d/c'd Vanc/Zosyn [**8-17**], and planned for continued course of
Azithro
- albuterol and ipratropium nebs q4h (home regimen)
- solumedrol 125 q8 started to taper to Pred 60 [**8-16**] and cont.
taper over 10 days
- O2 NC to target sat in low 90s
- should have pulmonary consultant once on floor for COPD
.
#  Fever/leukocytosis: Although most likely source of infection
is lung as above, fairly unmpressive imaging begs further
consideration of infectious sources. Abdominal tenderness is
minimal with L>R. Will follow exam and abdomnial labs--no
indication for imaging at this time.
.
#  Interval progression of CT findings: minimal but need to d/w
rads whether this could be a recurrence of her malignancy
.
# Chronic Prednisone Use: may need continued solumedrol as
stress dose steroid as her adrenal  axis is likely shut down
with 15mg prednisone daily.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: [**Last Name **] problem. If drug induced, likely the
product of one of her outpt meds. Only culprit which stands out
on her list is PPI, will switch to sucralfate.
.
# SVT: given hx of SVT exacerbated by albuterol, will continue
AV nodal agents. Holding Lisinopril in MICU. Restarted on
discharge
