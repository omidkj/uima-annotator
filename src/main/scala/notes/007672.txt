Fall; GI bleed

None.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86418**] is a 78 year-old-woman with a history of MVR (in
[**8-26**]), atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presented to an OSH
from home with falls.  She reports that 8 days ago she got out
of bed to go to the bathroom and her left foot was asleep.  She
fell and landed on her L buttock without head trauma.  She
continued to have multiple falls per day (reported 15 on the day
of admission) and was brought to an OSH ED where head CT showed
a 2 mm left temporal SDH.  She does note a fall with head trauma
about 7 days ago when she hit her head on the "clothes horse."
She denies dizziness, lightheadedness or presyncope with the
falls. She denies chest pain or palpitations. She has shortness
of breath now but not in recent past.  At the OSH she had an INR
of 8.0 and received 10mg IV vitamin K and 2 units of FFP. She
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurgical evaluation.
HCT at that time was 26.8.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T102. 74 90/60 18 99. She had a
repeat head CT showing the 2mm left temporal SDH and
neurosurgical evaluation recommended reversing her INR, starting
keppra and following repeat head CT. Trauma was consulted for
her buttock hematoma and CT of the abdomen/pelvis was done which
showed a L buttock hematoma without other intra-abdominal
injuries. Her blood pressures transiently dropped to the 80s
systolic, down from 90s on arrival. She received 500ccs NS bolus
and BP improved to 100s. She was found to be markedly guaiac
positive and NG lavage was done which was negative.  GI was
consulted and recommended PPI [**Hospital1 **].  She was given 2 additional
units FFP for an INR of 2.8 and 2 units of PRBCs for a HCT of
23.5. She required 2L NC and desatted to 79% when off of oxygen.
She was also given Morphine 2mg IV x 3 for pain.
.
Patient was transferred to the ICU and was seen by neurosurgery
for subdural hematoma.  No surgical intervention was recommended
as bleed was small.  Patient underwent serial CT scans, which
were all stable.  Neurosurgy said it was ok to start heparin
drip (for MVR and afib) on [**3-10**] with goal ptt of 45-60.  Digoxin
was also held for a level of 3.1; it was restarted at low dose
on [**3-9**].  Patient was hemodynamically and neurologically stable
and was sent to the floor for further treatment and disposition.
.
On the floor, patient complained of a severe headache; this is
the same headache she states that she's had for 17 years.  No
visual changes.  No weakenss of tingling in extremities.  Also
complains of "full body pain" from her fall the other day.
Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.

================
IMAGING / STUDIES:

[**2124-3-7**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation. Low limb lead QRS voltage.
ST-T wave changes. Findings are non-specific. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

[**2124-3-7**] CT Head without contrast: IMPRESSION: Small subdural
hematoma overlying the left hemispheric convexity with more
acute component seen adjacent to the temporal lobe. No shift of
midline structures. No hydrocephalus.

[**2124-3-7**] CT C-spine without contrast: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute
cervical fracture or malalignment. 2. Heterogeneous right
thyroid lobe. Recommend clinical correlation with possible
ultrasound if indicated.

[**2124-3-8**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The t
