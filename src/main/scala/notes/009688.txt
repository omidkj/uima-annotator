Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to MICU intubated and sedated s/p sepsis protocol.
Serial CXR and a CTchest demonstrate b/l infitrates and
progressive pulmonary edema.  Serial enzymes demonstrate
decreasing cks/ckmb but slowly increasing trps.  Thought at that
time to be in septic [**Month/Day/Year **] with chf enzyme leak (EF 20%
admission echo). Started on vanco, azithro, ceftiaxone.  Day #1
Swan ganz catheter placed without complication, numbers appear
to be sepsis although unclear, EKG with flipped Twaves [**Name (NI) **] and V2
compared to previous.  Day 2: hx of mrsa osteo recently, pt
started on zosyn and ctx d/c'd, pt also develops hypotension
requiring dopamine.  Day #3 SG hemodynamics (low svr of ? sepsis
and high wedge and cvp of ? cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **]) combined with
increasing trp / change in ekg from ?st depression to flipped
twaves in V1 and V2 / afebrile / no growth from blood cultures =
likely more cardiogenic (from either new AMI or demand ischemia)
than septic [**Name (NI) **] although still mixed picture.  Pt started on
natrecor, continued on dopamine, in order to treat for
cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **].  Blood cultures remained negative. Over next
days pt diuresed well on natrecor and lasix, dopamine
successfully weaned off, and patient with improved clinical
status.  On HD #8 pt with increasing wbc and low grade fever,
lines changed and sent for culture.  HD #10, pt spiked first
fever since admission 101.5, culture of cordis catheter tip pos
from HD 8 for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans, blood cultures neg, pt started
on fluconazole for 14days.  HD#11 pt extubated and tolerated
respirations spontaneously quite well, however began to be
aggressive and inappropriate with the staff.  Apparently pt with
long psychiatric history and repeated AMA discharges in the
past; psychiatry consulted.  HD #12, pt is tolerating POs well
and is stable off of the ventilator, although severely
deconditioned.  Transfered to floor for further management.

1. Delirium - was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], but with CT results
Neurology wanted to investigate normal pressure hydrocephalus.
Consent was obtained for a lumbar puncture; 30 cc of CSF were
removed with the LP.  Pt's neuro status was monitored every 2
hours for the next 12 hours, without any marked improvement.
Neurology wanted to obtain a head MRI, but this was
contraindicated due to the patient's metal penile prosthesis.
Multiple attempts were made to obtain medical records from [**Hospital1 2025**]
and the patient's surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**], but these were
unsuccessful.  However, the patient's delirium had resolved or
nearly resolved by [**2108-10-27**], with the patient alert and oriented
x 3, attention good with ability to perform Serial 7's and MYOB.
 D/C 1:1 sitter on [**2108-10-28**].  Neurology signed off on [**10-29**],
determining that pts delerium had resolved.

2. ID - Patient's blood cultures remained negative, although 2
cultures (right arterial line catheter tip + left IJ catheter)
came back positive for enterobacter cloacae, sensitive to
meropenem.  The patient's initial regimen of vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin, Zosyn, and fluconazole was changed to include
meropenem (meropenem was substituted for Zosyn).  Given the
patient's history of osteomyelitis, ID recommended a full six
week course of antibiotics.

3. CV - echo initially with cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] = 20%, once
resolved, EF improved to 40%.  Echo also showed aortic valve
area = 1.0 cm, bicuspid aortic valve.  EKG with ST changes and T
wave inversions, with elevated CK-MB and troponins [**2108-10-10**].
Resolved during ICU stay.  Pt should follow-up with cardiology
once ID issues have resolved for possible cath/CABG/aortic valve
replacement, etc.  Pt continued on aspirin, beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor.

4. Hypercholesterolemia - patient's statin was held in setting
of elevated CK's, which eventually trended back to normal.
Restarted on pravastatin.

5. Diabetes - was managed on insulin sliding scale while in
house.  Added glipizide 5 mg PO BID.

6. Anemia - microcytic anemia, at baseline Hct in low 30s.  Iron
normal, TIBC low, ferritin normal, TRF low.  Thought to be
anemia of chronic disease.
