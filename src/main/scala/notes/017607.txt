Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 84 year old male with past medical history
significant for CAD, CHF, DM, and atrial fibrillation who
presents from home with one week of productive cough, decreased
PO intake, diarrhea, and N/V.
.
# Cough/N/V:
As the hospital course continued, we felt it most likely that he
had a viral syndrome that led to nausea, vomiting, decreased PO
intake, and cough. His productive cough with a leukocytosis was
initially concerning for pneumonia; however, his chest x-rays
were unrevealing. His vomiting by his history was actually
ambiguous and may have represented violently coughing up large
quantities of white sputum, according to his daughter's history.
.
Given the possibility of pneumonia, he was started on
levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia, which was
discontinued on the equivalent of day [**7-6**] of the course
(uncertainty based on changing renal function at the time of
discontinuation). Vancomycin was started as well for this, but
was discontinued given that patient lives at home and has not
had a lot of exposure to the healthcare system.  Vancomycin was
re-introduced for concern for septic joint (see below). Cultures
were unrevealing, influenza DFA was negative, legionella ag was
negative, and follow-up chest x-rays were unrevealing.
.
When on the medicine floor he continued to be afebrile. His
white count rose while on the medicine floor; given that his
respiratory status remained stable, this was judged unlikely to
be secondary to the respiratory infection, and ultimately, more
likely to be the result of a florid gout flare.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: In the MICU he was continued on sotalol,
dosed 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] in light of ARF; he is on 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] at baseline.
As his renal function improved he had an episode of afib with
RVR to the 150s, with hypotension (70s over palp), for which he
was triggered, given IV metoprolol and IV fluids; this
eventually resolved, and he was then continued on 80 mg sotalol
[**Hospital1 **] thereafter, and had no further episodes of RVR.
.
His anticoagulation was held, first because of supratherapeutic
INR, and then because of concern for hemorrhagic joint. He was
started on enoxaparin (Lovenox) on [**2124-12-17**]. He was then started
on warfarin on [**2124-12-18**].
.
# Hypotension: Appears to be at baseline at this time, mainly in
90s-100s, and his baseline SBP is 80's to 90's per OMR records.
He responded well to the fluids given during first day of
admission.  His lactate was 2.0 at admission, and he remains not
tachycardic.  Ultimately we felt that it was more likely that
his hypotension was due to low baseline BP and severe
dehydration in setting of poor PO intake and diarrhea/vomiting.
He had one other episode of hypotension, which was clearly
secondary to afib with RVR, described above.
.
# Knee swelling, likely gout: Patient has right knee that
appeared bruised on admission, with possible joint effusion
appreciated. Rheumatology was consulted, given history of gout
as well as history of septic joint in setting of gout infection.
