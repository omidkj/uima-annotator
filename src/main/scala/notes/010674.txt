Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
(STEMI)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cypher stent placement
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
59 y/o man with hx. LAD stent (? date) who apparently underwent
surgery at approx 1300 today at the VA for 'deviated septum'. He
had been off of his aspirin for the preceding 5 days (presumably
in anticipation of surgery). Per report, either after or during
surgery he was given some intranasal coacaine (for bleeding). In
post-op after the surgery, he got up to go to the bathroom, and
complained of acute onset of chest pressure (1.5 hours after
surgery). He appeared to be having acute, anterior, STEMI on ECG
so was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for emergent management. In the ED, his ECG
was consistent with anterior stemi, he was plavix loaded,
started on heparin gtt with 5000 U bolus, started on integrelin
with bolus, given aspirin, nitroglycerin gtt, and taken to the
cath. lab. There he was found to have LMCA patent, LAD with
proximal occlusion of previous stent, T.O of OM1 with distal
collateral perfusion, RCA dominant with moderate, diffuse,
disease and supplying collateral perfusion to the OM. His wedge
pressure mean was 24. He was given 20 of IV lasix times one. He
undewent cypher stenting of the in-stent thrombosis of his prior
LAD stent. About half-way through the procedure his nose started
bleeding. Integrellin was d/c'd; ENT was called, the
administered bilateral NC suction and "merocel" packing
bilaterally with control of bleeding. He is transfered to the
CCU for further management.

Past Medical History:
HTN, HCL, MI s/p LAD cypher stent [**2182**]

Social History:
rare etoh, last in [**December 2186**]. Ongoing smoking for past 45 y, 1
ppd.

Family History:
No family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden
death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 137/80 mm Hg while supine. Pulse was 84
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 14 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 7 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Cardiac catheterization on [**2187-3-7**]:

BRIEF HISTORY:   59 year old man with known CAD s/p stent
placement to
the pLAD in [**7-13**] stopped ASA for rhinoplasty for deviated septum
where
some intranasal cocain was applied for hemostasis. Shortly after
the
procedure, he developed chest pain.  EKG shows anterior ST
elevations
with reciprocal ST depression in I and slight ST elevation in
III.  He
was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac catheterization laboratory for
anterior
STEMI.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class IV,  unstable.

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French XB LAD guide and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

PTCA COMMENTS:     The angiogram showed occlusive stent
thrombosis in
the mid LAD. The strategy was to stent this lesion. We used
Heparin,
Integrilin, Aspirin and Clopidogrel prophylactically. A 6F XB
LAD 3.5
guide provided adequate support. A PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] Intermediate wire
crossed
in to the distal vessel easily. We then performed thrombectomy
with a
quick cat catheter with some resolution of thrombus. We then
predilated
the lesion with a 2.0 X 15 mm Voyager balloon up to 10 atm. We
then
deployed a 3.0 X 28mm Cypher stent in to the lesion at14 atm.
The stent
was post dilated with a 3.5 X 20 mm balloon up to 20 atm. The
final
angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no
dissection,
no perforation and no embolisation. The patient left the lab in
a stable
condition.
