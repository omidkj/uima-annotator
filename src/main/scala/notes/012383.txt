Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2139-6-15**] - Flexible bronchoscopy and 8-0 Portex tracheostomy
tube placement.
[**2139-5-21**] - Aortic valve replacement with a size 21 Magna tissue
valve, mitral valve replacement with a size 25 [**Company 1543**] bovine
tissue valve, and tricuspid valve repair with size 30 [**Doctor Last Name **]
ring.


History of Present Illness:
This 68-year-old patient with severe aortic stenosis, mitral
stenosis and mitral regurgitation plus significant tricuspid
regurgitation with normal coronary arteries with preserved
ventricular function was electively admitted for triple valve
surgery. The major significant history was history of cirrhosis
with the child B bordering on C calcification occasionally with
the prior gastrointestinal bleeding and esophageal varices and
splenomegaly and also idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Because of
the co-morbidities, she was optimized for surgery for quite a
few months where she underwent a recurrent tapping of the
ascites and also had treatment for the thrombocytopenia by
way of steroids and platelet infusion and immunoglobulin
injection. Once the liver function was optimized as best as
possible almost to a child A bordering on B status and some
response of the platelet count to hematological management,
further discussion was had with the patient about the high- risk
of the surgery. The patient was very keen to proceed with the
operation because of the recurrent admissions for congestive
cardiac failure and a very poor quality of life and was willing
to take the high risk operation. She was electively admitted for
surgery. On the day before surgery, she had further dose of
hemoglobin given to increase the platelet count to above
100,000. This was done successfully and the patient was taken to
operating room.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe valvulopathies, including at least moderate aortic
stenosis
with estimated aortic valve area of 1 cm2, mixed mitral valve
disease with moderate MR and mild MS (MVA 1.5-2.0 cm2), followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**]. Felt to be a poor candidate for a complex
multi-valve surgery.
2. Severe secondary pulmonary hypertension, on home oxygen
therapy at home 2.5 liters per minute. Her last pulmonary
pressures were 53/25/37 on catheterization in [**2138-9-21**].
Portopulmonary hypertension is felt to be a contributor.
3. Congestive heart failure, echo with preserved systolic
function in [**1-/2139**] albeit in setting of mitral regurgitation.
4. Longstanding diabetes type 2, last hemoglobin A1c 5.7 on
[**2138-10-7**].
5. Liver cirrhosis, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34448**], presumed
secondary to NASH with contribution from cardiac cirrhosis,
complicated by ascites, splenomegaly, and varices on EGD
[**2139-1-22**] (grade 2 and one grade [**12-23**] in the distal 3-4 cm of the
esophagus)
6. ITP, compounded by severe liver disease and splenomegaly,
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**]. No response to IVIG, low and high dose
Prednisone therapy, and life-threatening intravascular hemolysis
following WinRho. On no therapy at present.
7. Osteoporosis, on Fosamax.
8. Basal Cell Carcinoma.

Social History:
She lives alone at home, with extensive VNA services
(telemonitoring). Her daughter is very involved in her care. She
used to work in consumer services, has been unable to work in
recent months.

[**2139-5-18**] - Ultrasound and paracentesis
The liver is shrunken and slightly nodular in appearance
consistent with cirrhosis. No dilated ducts are noted. The left,
middle and right hepatic veins are patent. The IVC is patent.
The left main, right anterior and right posterior portal veins
are patent. Flows are in appropriate directions.
There is a moderate amount of ascites, and a spot was marked in
the left lower quadrant for a paracentesis to be done by the
clinical service.

[**2139-5-21**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe  mitral annular calcification. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the Aortic
position with
normal leaflet motion. Given suboptimal echo windows gradients
could not be obtained across the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
2. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral
position with
normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 9 mmHg). CO
was 8 l/min No mitral regurgitation is seen.
3. A well-seated Tricuspid ring is seen. Trace to mild TR was
seen. Mean
gradient across the valve is 5 mm of Hg.
4. LV function is unchanged.. RV function is mild to moderately
depressed.
5. Aortic contours appear intact post decannulation.

[**2139-6-11**] Head CT
No acute hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic lacune left
thalamus.

[**2139-6-10**] Chest/Abdomen CT Scan
1. Status post CABG for mitral and aortic valve replacements.
Moderate pleural effusion are present bilaterally. Compressive
atelectasis are also present at both lung bases.
2. Significant amount of ascites is noted within the abdomen.
There is hyperdense fluid within the pelvis suggesting the
presence of the hemoperitoneum. Left rectus sheet hematoma is
also noted.
3. Small liver and multiple collateral vessels and enlarged
spleen suggesting cirrosis.
4. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Pulmonary arterial hypertension with main pulmonary artery
measuring 4.2 cm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-5-17**] for surgical
management of her valve disease. After extensive discussion, Ms.
[**Known lastname **] agreed to surgery despite the fact that it would be a
high risk surgery. She was prepared for surgery by diuresis and
multiple ultrasound guided paracentesis by the Liver service.
IVIG was given prior to surgery given he history of ITP. The
