Pertinent Results:
[**8-11**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was noted to be a short almost cloacl vessel and was
heavily calcified. The LAD had diffuse disease proximally and a
70& proximal stent edge restenosis in the mid LAD. Septal
collateral were noted to the distal RCA. The LCX had a near
ostial heavily calcified 90% lesion with proximal 40% stenosis
before OM!. Diffuse palquing was noted in OM2 and a 50% stenosis
was noted near the takeoff of AV groove CX from OM2. OM
collaterals to distal RCA were noted as well. The RCA was small
and occluded proximally. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly
elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEPD of 16 mmHg.
There was moderate systolic arterial hypertension with an SPB of
176 mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.94 L/min/m2.o
evidence of aortic stenosis as there was no pressure gradient on
pullback from LV to aorta. There was no evidence of mitral
stenosis upon analysis of PCWP and LVEDP.
[**8-12**] CNIS: There is less than 40% stenosis within bilateral
internal carotid arteries.
[**8-12**] Vein Mapping: Lesser saphenous veins patent bilaterally
with diameters described as above and no visualization of the
greater saphenous veins bilaterally.
[**8-17**] Echo: Pre bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
inferior hypokinesis. The remaining left ventricular segments
contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are multiple severe complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
Epiaortic scans of the intended sites of proximal anastamosis,
cannulation, and cross clamp are clear. A long axis epiaortic
pull through from valve up confirms substatial plaque in the
arch, but not at the above mentioned sites..The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace eccentric
aortic regurgitation is seen. The annular portion of the
posterior leaflet of the mitral valve is partialy calcified but
the tip and central portion move and coapt well.. With
provacative manuvers and sbp 150's, Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Vena contracta meansures 4 mm at
worst. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
pericardial calcifications. Post Bypass: Patient is A paced, on
epinephreine, phenylepherine infusions. LVEF remains 50% with
mild inferior hypokinesis. Note is made of moderate anteroseptal
hypokinesis which improves with nitroglycerin. MR is now mild.
Aortic contours are intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**8-21**] Chest CT: 1. New tiny left anterior pneumothorax. 2. Small
bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
atelectasis. 3. Sub 5 mm pulmonary nodules. In the absence of
known malignancy or smoking, no further followup is necessary.
4. No retroperitoneal hematoma. 5. Prominent ovaries.
Questionable soft tissue nodule in the left ovary. Further
evaluation with pelvic ultrasound is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service on [**8-8**] )cardiology floor)
at [**Hospital1 18**] for work-up and treatment of CHF exacerbation, NSTEMI,
and her failing renal transplant.
.
Pt was found to be volume overloaded with bilateral pleural
effusions and peripheral edema.  The decision was made to not
continue levofloxacin since it appeared very unlikely to be
infection (afebrile, no cough).  CHF was treated with agressive
diuresis with Furosemide 120 mg IV BID as well as Metolazone 2.5
mg PO BID with the goal of diuresis of at least 1L/day which she
exceeded by about 1L on the first 2 days with decreases in her
weight by about 2kg per day as well (for 2 days). Clinically, pt
improved also coming off oxygen at then end of HOD#2.
.
Pt was admitted with what was thought consistent with NSEMI in
the setting of previously known CAD s/p MI, s/p LAD stents and
acute on chronic renal failure with failing renal transplant.
Pt was monitored on telemetry and cardiac enzymes were followed.
 The enzymes consistently trended downward indicating that pt
had an NSEMI prior to presentation to the OSH.  The initial
approach was medical management as there was an obvious concern
over the patients renal function.  A renal transplant consult
was placed; their recommendation was to initiate HD, as there
was no reason to delay (
