History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 y.o. woman with PMH of T1-T2 paraplegia,
frequent admissions for PNA and UTI, and COPD (on 1.5-2L NC at
home), who presented with acute mental status changes and
changes in her breathing status. She had dinner with her friend
and one of her primary caregivers, [**Name (NI) **]. She was having some
trouble eating - her friend notes chronic trouble eating/food
sticking in her throat. 45 minutes after eating, the friend went
back to her room where she found her vomiting and not feeling
well. She put her friend in bed and gave her 1.5 mg of
clonazepam. 30 minutes later she found her to be lethargic with
O2sat 83-84% on 2L NC (usually 90-92%).  Given this, her friend
drove her to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **] from [**Location (un) 1475**] while keeping her on
8L NC.

Her friend noted that she got poorer Chest PT over the weekend
and resumed smoking over the last two weeks. She denied noticing
any increase in cough, SOB, dysuria, incontinence, or cloudy
urine over the past few days.

She recently was given a narcotic agreement w/ her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 665**] who noted that he would not be prescribing her narcotics
anymore since he felt her burning lower extremity pain was
neuropathic in nature, not c/w her pain from her vehicle
accident, and would be better treated w/ gabapentin rather than
narcotics.

Upon arrival in the ED, initial VS were: T 34.6, HR 110, BP
128/102 or 156/108, RR 8, O2sat to 80s. She had blue lips and
was breathing at RR 8. She was given Narcan and became
arousable. However, 40 minutes later she became somnolent,
de-satted to the 80s, and was unresponsive to a 2nd dose of
Narcan.

She was intubated, which was reportedly difficult. Aspirate was
suctioned out. She was given a dose of levaquin. A U/A was
significant for negative nitrites, large leuks, negative blood,
negative glucose, negative ketones, 2 RBCs, 152 WBCs, few
bacteria, and 1 epi.  Utox was positive for benzos and
methadone, but she did get benzos with intubation. On an ABG
following her intubation, pH 7.28/pCO2 60/pO2 370/HCO3 29.

On arrival to the MICU, VS: T 96.8, HR 89, BP 141/106, RR 13,
100% on ventilator. She was started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] and given a 1L
NS bolus given that her BP fell to SBP 80s.

Past Medical History:
# T1 to T2 paraplegia status post a motor vehicle accident.
# Recurrent pneumonia (followed by pulm - Last [**2149-4-9**])
- Per pulm, recurrent pneumonia likely from pulmonary toilet
issues secondary to neuromuscular disease with improvement with
consistent and aggressive bronchopulmonary therapy.
- Prior sputum cultures + for MRSA, pan-sensitive Klebsiella,
and Pseudomonas.
# Recurrent UTIs in the setting of urinary retention requiring
straight catheterization
# COPD
# hepatitis C
# anxiety
# DVT in [**2142**] -IVC filter placed in [**2142**]
# Pulmonary nodules
# Hypothyroidism
# Chronic pain
# Chronic gastritis
# Anemia of chronic disease
# S/p PEA arrest during hospitalization in [**2147-10-3**]
