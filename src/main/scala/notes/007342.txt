CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2126-2-18**] 5:07 PM

IMPRESSION: Acute, extensive pulmonary embolus, including saddle
embolus and thombus within all of the lobar arteries and
extending into the segmental branches. There is CT evidece of
right heart strain. Correlation with echocardiography is
recommended.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2126-2-18**] 4:17 PM

IMPRESSION: Stable radiograph with no superimposed acute
process.
In comparison with earlier study of this date, there is little
change except for placement of a right IJ catheter that extends
to the mid portion of the SVC.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2126-2-18**]  4:01:34 PM

Sinus tachycardia. Modest right ventricular conduction delay.
Consider prior inferior myocardial infarction. Low precordial
QRS voltage is non-specific.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2125-11-15**] sinus tachycardia is now present.

IMPRESSION: Deep venous thrombosis of the right popliteal vein
extending to the right superficial femoral vein.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Done [**2126-2-19**] at 3:31:13 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility with apical sparing ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign). There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2126-2-21**] 12:13 PM

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-18**], there is little
change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Again there is
elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with meniscus
formation consistent with pleural fluid.

The right IJ catheter again extends to the mid portion of the
SVC. No evidence of acute pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 73566**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-2-18**] with acute
CP and SOB, found to have massive bilateral PEs on CTA.  The
remainder of his hospital course is broken down by system as
follows:

 Neuro
Pain reasonably well controlled on oxycodone and tylenol.
 Card
Chest pain resolving after PE treated. Pt placed on simvastatin.
CXR negative on admission as detailed in results section.
 Pulm
Pt was SOB from bilateral PEs.  His SOB decreased during
hospital course as his PEs were treated, and he was able to
ambulate to kitchen without becoming SOB on date of discharge.
 GI
min clear DM fluids, lytes repleted prn
 GU
no major issues, continued to void spontaneously
 Heme
A hep gtt started on arrival, cardiac enzymes were cycled, LENIs
performed which showed DVT as detailed in results section.  An
IVC filter was placed on [**2126-2-21**] which he tolerated well. Pt is
being discharged on coumadin 5 with lovenox bridge, to f/u
coumadin clinic Mon [**2126-2-25**] to maintain appropriate INR.
 ID
no major issues.
 Endo
Patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale during this
hospitalization.  He should resume his home medications
including glyburide and metformin on discharge.

Mr. [**Known lastname 73566**] is being discharged home today in stable condition.
He is being discharged on lovenox and coumadin, so he should be
closely followed in coumadin clinic/Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].
 He knows to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5695**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] to
confirm his follow-up appointments scheduled for [**2126-3-11**].  His
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 73567**] is aware that he is being discharged on
coumadin with a lovenox bridge.
