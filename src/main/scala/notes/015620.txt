Admission Date:  [**2143-6-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-6-11**]


Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is the fifth hospital
admission this year for this 79-year-old African American man
with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Patient noted worsened dyspnea for the week prior to
admission; nursing home M.D. noted that it was acutely worse
two days prior to admission, and at that time increased his
prednisone dose from 50-80 mg q day, and increased his
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments to 4x a day.
Patient also reported increased cough productive of yellow
sputum.

At baseline, he is not dyspneic at rest when wearing oxygen,
although he is dyspneic with even minimal ambulation.  He and
his family have noted a significant progressive decline in
his exercise tolerance during the past year.

On arrival, he appeared in respiratory distress.  Blood
pressure 113/83, pulse 102, respirations 22, O2 saturation
98% on 100% nonrebreather.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oxygen dependent.
Recent FEV1 of 0.62 which is 22% of predicted, FVC of 1.99,
total lung capacity 106% of predicted.
2. Prostate cancer with bone metastases.
3. Chronic atonic bladder and is chronically catheterized.
4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
5. Renal mass.  CT scan of the abdomen in [**2143-2-16**]
showed a large cystic mass with multiple septations and small
area of enhancement.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone 80 mg q day, day #3.
2. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers qid.
3. Atrovent two puffs q6h.
4. Ventolin 4 mg po qid.
5. Flovent two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
6. Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Divorced.  He has several children who live
in the area.  He quit smoking two years ago.  Does not drink
alcohol.  He has been living in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing
Home Rehabilitation since discharge from [**Date range (1) 107423**] [**Hospital1 1444**] admission for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  Before then, he had
been living alone at home.  He is a retired air conditioning
and heating plant operator.

creatinine 0.8, glucose 124, CPK 58, troponin less than 0.3.
Calcium 9.4, phosphorus 2.6, magnesium 1.9.  Arterial blood
gas on [**2143-6-7**]:  PH 7.38, pCO2 59, pO2 171.  Blood cultures
taken on [**2143-6-7**] had no growth as of [**2143-6-11**].  Urine
culture [**2143-6-7**] showed mixed flora.

Electrocardiogram:  Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute
with a normal axis, slight ST depressions in V5 and V6.

Chest x-ray showed large lung volumes, no infiltrate or
effusion.

IMPRESSION, PLAN, AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 79-year-old male
with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
presenting with respiratory distress.  Impression was chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare with possible upper
respiratory infection as precipitant given his reports of
increased sputum.

ISSUES:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation:  On
admission, he was started on high dosed intravenous steroids,
Solu-Medrol at 80 mg IV tid, and was given albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizer treatments every three hours.  He
experienced subjective improvement in his symptoms daily,
although he continued to have wheezing and dyspnea on minimal
exertion, which was his baseline even on discharge.

On [**2143-6-10**], he was switched from IV steroids to oral
steroids, which was prednisone 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], and switched from
beta agonist and Atrovent nebulizers to inhaler treatments,
additionally a steroid inhaler was started.  Subjectively
felt better over the next 24 hours, only requiring an
albuterol nebulizer treatment once.

Given his end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
his dyspnea with almost any activity, the Intensive Care
Unit's attending pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**]
suggested that the patient may benefit from opioid treatment
to blunt his sensation of dyspnea and to improve his quality
of life.  On discharge, the patient is to start MS Contin 15
mg [**Hospital1 **] and this can be titrated as needed.  Of note, he will
need to start on a laxative regimen after starting the opioid
treatment.

His prednisone dose was decreased from 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 60 mg q
day on [**2143-6-11**].  Given that patient has some wheezing even
with high-dosed steroids, we suspect that he may not be very
steroid responsive.  We will write for prolonged taper from
high-dosed steroids.  He will continue on the beta agonist,
Atrovent, and steroid MDIs as an outpatient, and will
continue nebulizer treatments as needed.

He developed mild tachycardia and anxiety, and were given
frequent albuterol nebulizer treatments.  As such, we did not
continue giving him oral albuterol as he had been receiving
prior to admission.

Patient is do not resuscitate/do not intubate.  As of now, he
is willing to try noninvasive ventilation.  Unfortunately,
given his end-stage lung disease, he is likely to have
recurrent hospitalizations in the future.

2. Urinary tract infection:  Started on levofloxacin 500 mg q
day on [**2143-6-8**]; will complete last dose on [**2143-6-14**].

3. Atonic bladder:  He remained on Foley catheter while
in-house.

4. Likely renal mass on CT scan in [**2143-2-16**].  The
patient would not be an operative candidate even if he had
renal cell carcinoma; no further workup is indicated at this
time.

5. Prostate cancer:  He sees an oncologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
at [**Hospital1 69**] for Lupron injections
q3 months; last given in [**5-21**].

6. Disposition:  To rehabilitation facility; will likely need
[**Hospital 4820**] nursing home placement thereafter as he is probably
too chronically ill to care for himself at home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2. Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levofloxacin 500 mg q day, last dose [**2143-6-14**].
2. Protonix 40 mg q day.
3. Prednisone 60 mg po q day x1 week, then 40 mg po q day x1
week, then 20 mg po q day x1 week, then 10 mg po q day
chronically.  The M.D. at the rehabilitation center will
likely need to titrate these doses based on the patient's
symptomatology.
4. Salmeterol discus one puff [**Hospital1 **].
5. Ipratropium MDI two puffs qid.
6. Flovent 110 mcg per puff two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
7. Albuterol nebulizer treatment q2-4h prn for worsening
dyspnea.
8. Ipratropium nebulizer treatments q4h prn for worsened
dyspnea.
9. MS Contin 15 mg [**Hospital1 **], hold for oversedation.
10. Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], hold for loose stools.
11. Senokot two tablets q hs, hold for loose stools.
12. Please continue on [**12-20**] liters nasal cannula oxygen for
goal O2 saturation of over 90%.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

FOLLOWUP:  Please [**Name6 (MD) 138**] primary M.D., [**Doctor Last Name 5717**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] to
schedule an appointment in [**10-7**] days.  The patient already
has an appointment with his oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
[**2143-8-19**].
