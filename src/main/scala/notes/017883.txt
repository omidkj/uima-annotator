Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p fall with large pannus hematoma.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
52yof w/CHF (EF 15-20%), AFib (s/p cardioversion x2, currently
on amio), presented to ED s/p fall. Pt. was home alone morning
of admission, fell forward while trying to get off of the
toilet. She broke her fall with her hands, and there was no LOC
or head trauma. She reports that her knees buckled and that
following the fall she could not get up, so she crawled to her
bedroom and called 911.
.
At baseline, she is ambulatory at home, but over the last
several weeks, she (and her sister) have noted increasing
SOB/DOE, leg edema, general malaise/fatigue, and a ?new fine
resting tremor involving her digits and lips. On ROS, she denies
HA, chest pain or pressure, cough, nausea/vomiting,
diarrhea/constipation, fever/chills, dysuria,
melena/hematochezia, recent illness.
.
Her only recent medication change was an increase in lasix from
40 to 80 PO BID on [**2187-10-19**].
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], Pt. found to have a Hct drop from baseline mid-30s to
27.8 to 20.8 and an INR of 5.7. She was initially admitted to
the floor but given her decreased hematocrit was transferred to
the CCU team.

Past Medical History:
1. non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 15-20%
2. hypertension
3. paroxysmal AFib (dx in [**2181**], s/p CV x2, currently on amio)
4. obesity
5. reactive airway disease
6. restrictive lung disease
7. bilateral knee surgeries
8. obstructive sleep apnea

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2187-10-30**]: LVEF=25%.  The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The aortic
valve is not well seen. There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at least
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the
prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2187-9-5**], left ventricular
systolic function appears slightly more vigorous now in the
setting of tachycardia. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
was elevated in the prior study (not noted in the prior report)
and remains significantly elevated.
.
CXR [**2187-10-30**]: Marked cardiomegaly. Absence of overt pulmonary
congestion and significant pleural effusion speak in favor of
appropriate clinical management.
.
CT abd [**2187-10-29**]: 1. More superior portion of large hematoma of
the right flank and anterior abdominal wall has become more
homogeneous in appearance on today's exam. This suggests further
interval bleeding. This portion of hematoma now measures 19.5 x
10.6 cm in greatest axial dimensions. 2. More inferior portion
of hematoma of the anterior abdominal wall measures up to 19.4 x
10.0 cm in maximum dimension on today's exam. It is difficult to
compare to [**10-23**], as the hematoma may have extended beyond
the Gantry on both of these exams, but this portion is likely
not significantly changed. 3. The liver appears dense on these
non-contrast images. This may reflect prior amiodarone use or
iron overload. Clinical correlation again recommended.
.
CT abd [**2187-10-23**]: There is a large soft tissue hematoma within
the right flank and anterior abdominal wall, measuring 17 x 11
cm in maximum dimension. 2. The liver appears dense on these
non-contrast enhanced images. This may reflect prior amiodarone
use or iron overload - clinical correlation is recommended.
.
CXR [**2187-10-23**]: Stable cardiomegaly. This may be consistent with
cardiomyopathy.
.
ECG [**2187-10-23**]: AFib with RVR (110s), nl. axis, low precordial
voltages, no ST-T changes.
.
Echo [**2187-9-5**]: 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. 2.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Severe
global hypokinesis. 3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 4. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. 5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At
least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 6. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 7. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. 8. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Cath [**2186-4-10**]: 1. Resting hemodynamics reveaeld elevated rigth
sided filling pressures (RA mean 11 mm Hg, RVEDP 14 mm Hg). The
PA pressures were significantly elvated (PA 62/30 mm Hg, mean PA
42 mm Hg). The PCWP was significantly elevated (mean PCWP 30 mm
Hg). 2. Left ventriculography revealed an EF of 30% with severe
global hypokinesis. There was no significant mitral
regurgitation. 3. Selective coronary angiography revealed a
right dominant system. The LMCA was angiographically normal. The
LAD had a 30% distal stenosis. The LCX was angiographically
normal. The RCA was the dominant vessel and was angiographically
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 52yoF with Afib, s/p fall with large abdominal hematoma and 10
point Hct drop.
.
On admission, Pt. was transferred to the CCU for management of
enlarging pannus hematoma, SOB/DOE, and anemia, all in the
setting of severe CHF, and AFib with supratherapeutic INR.  In
the CCU, the Pt. was transfused with FFP (6 units), pRBCs (12
units), and vit. K (10 mg x 2) and her blood counts slowly
stabilized (Hct 29.5, INR 1.3).  Surgery team was consulted and
agreed with reversing her coagulopathy and suggested applying an
abdominal binder. The Pt. did not tolerate the binder. The Pt.
was also evaluated by EP and was initially scheduled to have a
cardioversion but this was deferred given the reversal of her
anti-coagulation.  The current plan is to attempt cardioversion
after 1 month load of amiodarone, which the Pt. began on [**11-4**]
