History of Present Illness:
MR [**Known lastname 107214**] is a 63M who presented to the ED with
nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. CT was consistent with ischemia
and perforation. With his past history of artificial heart valve
requiring anti-coagulation, and extensive cardiac disease, he
was a high operative risk. However, as bowel ischemia would
proved fatal in this patient, it was decided to operate.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, his CT was consistent with ischemia and perforation.
He was emergently taken to the operating room for an ex lap with
small bowel resection. Due to his prosthetic aortic valve, it
was deemed essential to resume his anti-coagulation. He re-bled
and was taken back to the OR, after which his anticoagulation
was restarted. Although he at first stabilized, he eventually
needed 2 further emergent revisions for bleeding from the
anastomosis.

He was transferred to the SICU after his emergent surgical
issues had resolved. He was maintained on vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and fluconazole as empiric coverage for his
perforated viscus. He made slow gradual improvement. A Dobhoff
tube was palced and he started tubefeeds on [**2105-6-3**]. On [**2105-6-5**] he
passed copious old dark blood per rectum. His hematocrit
remained stable, and this blood was deemed to be old
intraluminal blood and not an indicator of new bleeding. He
continued to have sporadic respiratory difficulties while
intubated, with bilateral infiltrates seen on CXR that were slow
to resolve. However, it is unlikely that there is an infectious
process in the lungs.

Neurologically, he remained fairly heavily sedated while
intubated, although he remained responsive and was able to move
all extremities. After his trach placement, respiratory
stabilization, and weaning from sedation, he was doing quite
well neurologically and answered questions appropriately,
alhtough at times he seemed somewhat confused about the events
of the past few weeks.

He continued to tolerate his tubefeeds well, and gradually
improved. Although his anticoagulation continued throughout, he
did not re-bleed. He had some intermittent problems with
agitation, although this was managed with haldol, and pt's
sensorium gradually improved. By [**6-17**], he was tolerating
tubefeeds at 80cc/hr, and was respiring well on trach mask only,
without added ventilatory support. It is our opinion that he
will not need continued antibiotics. On [**6-22**] he underwent both
bedisde and video swallow eval. Per their evaluation, he can
tolerate thin liquids alternating with pureed solids,
alternating bite and sip, and needs to be supervised. Solid
foods are NOT advisable at present.
