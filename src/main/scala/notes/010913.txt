Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for CHF/NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stents x2 to left
anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
80 y/o M with PMH of DMII, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for
management of NSTEMI and CHF.  He originally presented to OSH
from [**Hospital3 **] facility with SOB.  His symptoms started on
Saturday when he was moving from his home to an [**Hospital3 **]
facility.  He started having chest burning heaviness lasting
about an hour associated with some SOB that eventually subsided.
 He thought that this was d/t GERD and took some tums.  On
Monday, he reported his sxs to the NP[**MD Number(3) 31663**] new [**Hospital3 **]
facility, who noted bilateral LE edema and advised him to sleep
on 2 pillows that night and she set him up for a EKG this
morning.  However, Monday evening he noticed he was SOB around
12am when he got out of bed to turn on the air conditioner.  He
went back to bed and at 3am he was still SOB, when his symptoms
persisted he called his daughter at 5am and took a baby aspirin.
 [**Name2 (NI) **] activated the help code at his assisted facility who called
the ambulance for transport to the OSH.  At OSH he was found to
have a troponin I of 0.38, CR 1.3, hyponatremia to 129, and CXR
showed infiltrative changes at both lung bases with minimal
fluid.  EKG showed NSR with RBBB, non-specific ST changes and
some ST depressions.  He was treated with DuoNebs, heparin gtt,
nitro gtt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.1 79 154/74 18 90% 4L
Labs and imaging significant for worsening interstitial edema
compared to OSH CXR. Patient given Lasix 20mg IV with 900cc
urine output.  He required bipap for RA sats in low 80s. EKG
showed RBBB and TWI precordially and <1mm STE in AVR. Repeat
troponin was 0.2.

Vitals on transfer were 96.6 ??????F (35.9??????C) (Axillary), Pulse: 54,
RR: 18, BP: 118/53,(nitro o.28mcg/kg)

On arrival to the floor, patient was resting comfortable in NAD.
He states that he endorses PND.  He sleeps on 1 pillow, although
he slept on 2 pillows last night on the advice of a NP[**MD Number(3) 31663**]
[**Hospital3 **] facility.  He has been using a cane to ambulate
over the last few weeks (more per his family) due to low back
pain and has a hx of arthritis.  In addition, over the last year
he has assumed full care of his wife who has worsening dementia
and has been eating microwaved meals with high salt content
since that time.

Of note, EKG from PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2122-7-14**] showed Sinus bradycardia (49),
normal axis, Q waves in II, III, aVF, and non-specific TWI,
RBBB.
