HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 year old gentleman
who is a patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with known coronary
artery disease.  The patient presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9920**] office
with progressive angina and abnormal exercise treadmill test.
The patient has a history of a silent myocardial infarction
with a previous cardiac catheterization in [**2125**].  The patient
has had stable angina over the years which was treated
medically but the patient reports a recent progression in his
frequency of angina.  Echocardiogram [**2152-6-1**] showed
ejection fraction of 30-35%, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, left ventricle mildly dilated, 1+ mitral
regurgitation.  The patient was referred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension; 2.  Noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus; 3.  Coronary artery disease; 4.
Remote tobacco history; 5.  Gout; 6.  History of
supraventricular tachycardia with frequent premature
ventricular contractions; 7.  History of a pulmonary nodule,
not felt to be significant; 8.  Status post silent myocardial
infarction; 9.  Thrombocytopenia; 10. History of left ulnar
nerve entrapment; 11. Cervical spine disease; 12. History of
Bell's palsy; 13. History of trigeminal neuralgia in [**2136**];
14. Obesity.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Preoperative medications include -

3.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.; 4.  Procardia XL 30 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; 5.  Isosorbide 20 mg p.o. q.d.; 6.  Allopurinol 300
mg p.o. b.i.d.; 7.  Glucophage 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.; 8.
Glyburide 1.25 mg p.o. q.d.; 9.  Niacin 500 mg p.o. q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative laboratory data revealed white
blood cell count 4.9, hematocrit 36, platelet count 91,
sodium 147, potassium 4.6, chloride 108, bicarbonate 25, BUN
23, creatinine 1.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2152-6-23**]
for cardiac catheterization which showed left ventricular
ejection fraction of 28%, left ventricular end diastolic
pressure of 36, 60% left main lesion, occluded left anterior
descending, 80% circumflex, 80% distal right coronary artery
lesion.  The patient was admitted to the hospital after his
catheterization for evaluation by Cardiac Surgery.  While the
patient was awaiting cardiac surgery the patient began
complaining of pain over his distal sacrum.  The patient was
started on antibiotics for a question of a pilonidal cyst.
On hospital day #3, [**6-25**] the patient was evaluated by
General Surgery for the lesion at his gluteal cleft.  General
Surgery felt that the lesion was an infected follicle which
was spontaneously draining and was not a pilonidal cyst.  He
did not require any surgical intervention but agreed with
antibiotic therapy.  The patient was taken to the Operating
Room on [**2152-6-26**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for a coronary artery
bypass graft times three, left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition.  Please see operative note for
further details.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on his first postoperative night.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable with adequate cardiac
index and blood pressure.  The patient was transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #1.  The patient
did well on the floor.  The patient's chest tubes, epicardial
pacing wires and Foley catheter were removed on postoperative
day #2.  The patient began ambulating with physical therapy.
On postoperative day #3 it was noted that the patient had a
moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage from his chest
tube sites, however, sternal incision was intact without any
drainage.  The patient had elevated blood sugars which were
covered with a regular insulin sliding scale.  The patient
was restarted on his oral hypoglycemic medications.  On
postoperative day #4 the patient worked with physical
therapy.  The patient was able to ambulate 500 feet and climb
one flight of stairs without difficulty.  The patient had
been weaned from his oxygen and has adequate saturations on
room air.  The patient was cleared for discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum 100.3, pulse 80,
regular rate and rhythm, blood pressure 128/66, respiratory
rate 20, room air oxygen saturation 93%.  The patient's
weight on [**2152-6-30**] was 106.7 kg, preoperatively the
patient was 104.6 kg.  The patient is awake and alert.  Lungs
are clear to auscultation.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen is soft, positive bowel sounds, obese.  Incision is
clean, dry and intact.  Extremities are with trace edema.
There is scant serosanguinous drainage from the patient's
mediastinal chest tube site.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glyburide 1.25 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Niacin 250 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Glucophage 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Allopurinol 600 mg q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
