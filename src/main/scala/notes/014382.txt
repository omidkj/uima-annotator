CT HEAD: IMPRESSIONS: No evidence of hemorrhage. There is
evidence of chronic small- vessel ischemic disease. If acute
infarction remains a concern, MRI would be recommended for more
sensitive evaluation.
.
CT CHEST/Abd/Pelv: IMPRESSION:
1. Evaluation for pulmonary embolism somewhat limited due to
timing of
contrast bolus, respiratory motion, and CT artifact. While no
large or
central pulmonary embolism is seen, linear filling defects in a
subsegmental branch in the left upper lobe, also involving
segmental branch in the right upper lobe, could represent small
pulmonary emboli or could be artifactual.
2. Small right and trace left pleural effusion with dependent
atelectasis
bilaterally. Small amount of fluid tracks along the inferior tip
of the liver and along the right paracolic gutter. Trace fluid
in left paracolic gutter. Small free pelvic fluid. Anasarca.
3. Cardiomegaly. Atherosclerotic disease.
4. Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Gallbladder is not
seen.
5. Atrophic pancreas with dilatation of the pancreatic duct
along the
pancreatic head, also with calcifications surrounding and within
this
pancreatic duct.
6. No definite bowel abnormality is seen despite lack of oral
contrast
administration.
7. Multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila,
retroperitoneum, measuring up to 11 mm in short axis. In
addition, soft tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.7 cm surrounding the
right external iliac artery, which likely represents a lymph
node or lymph node conglomerate.
8. 4-mm hypoattenuating endometrial stripe; correlation with the
patient's
hormonal status is recommended.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1557**]  was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-10-30**] for an elective
left ankle arthordesis. Pre-operatively, she was consented,
prepped, and brought to the operating room. Intra-operatively,
she was closely monitored and remained hemodynamically stable.
She tolerated the procedure well without any complication.
Post-operatively, she was transferred to the PACU and floor for
further recovery. On the floor, post operative day one hct 24.9,
post operative day 2 continued to be evaluated by physical
therapy whom recommended rehab placement.  She remained
hemodynamically stable.  Her pain was controlled. She progressed
with physical therapy to improve her strength and mobility.  She
developed diarrhea.  C-Diff culture was negative.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: Patient was coded on the floor for
unresponsiveness.  She had decorticate positioning with oral
tremors concerning for seizure.  Ativan did not break the
seizure and the patient was intubated, but otherwise
hemodynamically stable.  She was loaded with 1000mg IV phenytoin
which broke her seizure and Neurology was consulted.  She was
extubaed on the following morning, remained stable >24hrs after
extubation and was transfered to the floor.  CXR was concerning
for aspiration and patient complained of bladder spasms.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Issues:
#. MS change/Seizures: Possible post-ictal.  Patient's
electrolytes were corrected and Neurology was called for
possible etiologies of seizure.  Explained it was most likely
toxic metabolic, involving either electrolyte abnormalities or
medication changes, but cannot rule out watershed infarcts or
new stroke.
- Extubated >24hrs, doing well
- 100 mg phenytoin per day - redose based on level
.
# Likely UTI: patient with lots of bladder pain overnight.
Afebrile overnight but WBC slight increase and with symptoms,
would emperically treat.
- UA and Culture sent
- started oxybutinin for symptomatic bladder spasms
- Started Cefipime based on antibiotic resistances.
.
#  Pulmonary edema: Crackles throughout after large volume
resuscitation, only requireing 2L NC
- Lasix diuresis
.
#. Hyponatremia: resolved with fluid resuscitation
- NS bolus PRN
.
#. tachycardia, PVC: Corrected last PM
- electrolyte replacement PRN
.
#. Ankle fx: cont lovenox, ortho recs
.
#. anxiety: per family member pt with significant past panic and
anxiety attacs. perhaps contributed to patients situation
however doubt that this was a simple panic attact.
- sedation and proper treatment with haldol/ativan prn upon
extubation
.

On postop day #6, she was transferred back to the step-down
floor and remained stable.  She got a Bivalve short leg cast.
She completed a 3 day course of IV antibiotics for presumed UTI.
 She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on [**2199-11-9**] in
stable condition.
