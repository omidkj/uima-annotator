History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] is a 53 yo male patient who began feeling poorly 2
weeks prior to admission with fevers, neck pain, myalgias, and
arthralgias.  Laboratory work at his primary care provider's
office revealed a thrombocytopenia for which he was referred to
the oncology clinic.  Upon eval at oncology clinic, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**]
was confused and lethargic for 1-2 days and he was sent to an
OSH ED for evaluation.  Blood cultures at this OSH grew GPC for
which he was initially treated with vancomycin and clindamicin.
He later grew Group B Strep and his antibiotics were changed to
gentamicin and pencillin.  A tran-thoracic echocardigram
revealed a 1.5 cm vegetation on his aortic valve and at this
time he was transferred here for management of his endocarditis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] was transferred from an OSH on [**2146-1-30**].
He was initially evaluated by cardiology and neurology.  Head CT
and MRI rose question of epidural abscess and neuro-surgery was
consulted.  An infectious disease consult was also initiated
immediately with recommendation for ongoing gent and Pen G.
A C3-C6 epidural abscess was suspected with associated
meningitis and sepsis and he was taken emergently to the OR for
C3-C6 laminectomy on [**2146-1-31**].  Addional findings of "weak bone"
associated with osteo but no findings of focal abscess.
The cardiac surgery team was consulted on [**2146-2-2**].  TEE on [**2146-2-2**]
supported diagnosis or endocarditis.  Over the next several
days, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] went through a pre-operative evaluation and was
followed by neurology, neuro surgery, and infectious disease.
He continued to be in the ICU, intubated, and confused/agitated.
 It was felt that he was not ready for surgery and that the
longer antibiotics could be continued prior to surgery the
better Mr. [**Known lastname 58889**] outcomes would be.  He was also treated for
pneumonia.
He was successfully extubated on [**2146-2-7**] and remianed extubated
through [**2-11**] however he remained in the ICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.
Ongoing CHF with inability to obtain optimal hemodynamics pushed
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] to surgery emergently on [**2-14**].
On [**2146-2-14**] he proceeded to the OR with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm perimount
pericardial valve.  Please see OR report for full details.
On POD 1, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] failed to [**Doctor Last Name **] from the ventilator.
Infectious disease continued to follow Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] with ongoing
recs for vancomycin and levofloxacin.
On POD 2 he was succcessfully weened and extubated.  ID
discontinued his fluconazole.  He continued with an altered
mental status.
POD 3 through 7 he continued with hemodynamic monitoring and abx
administration.  He continued to be confused in the ICU.
A neuro consult on POD 7 stated significantly improved mental
status.  He was continued on haldol but began to [**Doctor Last Name **] from it.
On POD 9 he was transferred to the inpatinet floor for ongoing
recovery and rehabilitation.  His haldol was weened over the
next three days with ongoing dosing only at bedtime with
significant clearing of mental status to.  Neuro surgery was
again consulted to eval need for ongoing use of cervical collar
that Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] had been wearing since his laminectomy and it
was decided that he did not need to continue wearing it.
On POD 10 he was noted to have a worsening heart murmur and TTE
was obtained showing a ventricular septal defect.  Further
evaluation of this VSD (as a TEE) was declined as no surgical
intervention was felt to be necessary.
He continued with physical therapy through POD 15 and it was
felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] would benefit greatly from rehabilitation.
