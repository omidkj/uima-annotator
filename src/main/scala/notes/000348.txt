Service:  CARDIAC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncopal episode.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old female
with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, who presented to the
Emergency Department with three syncopal episodes.  The
patient reported that she woke up "feeling funny" the morning
of admission and then passed out.  This pattern was repeated
a total of three times while the patient remained at home.

The patient reported that before each episode, she felt as
though she was falling asleep.  She thought the room may have
spinning during one episode.  The patient denied chest pain,
dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, and visual symptoms in
relationship to the episodes.  She did note heart
palpitations after regaining consciousness, and she noted
that she became diaphoretic and lightheaded.

Noticeably, on the morning of admission, the patient reports
that her blood sugar was 400 and she had a systolic blood
pressure of 200, which was extremely unusual for her.  She
took her home medications including atenolol and presented to
the Emergency Department.

In the ED, the patient had four more syncopal episodes.
Telemetry during these episodes revealed complete heart block
with an atrial rate in the 60s and 70s.  There was no
ventricular response for up to nine seconds during these
episodes.  At other times, the patient had a [**2-6**] block, but
at other times was in [**1-6**] block with a heart rate of 90.  A
right internal jugular catheter was placed with a temporary
pacing wire in the Emergency Department.  The patient was
then transferred to the CCU for further care with a plan for
a permanent pacemaker placement on [**2140-8-6**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac:  Coronaries - No known history of coronary artery
disease, however, patient has multiple risk factors including
age and diabetes mellitus.  Was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction by cardiac enzymes. Patient was continued on
aspirin, ACE inhibitor, and statin.  Beta blocker was held on
admission.

Rhythm - Patient had episodes of complete heart block in the
Emergency Department.  A temporary pacing wire was placed at
that time, and she was in normal sinus rhythm throughout
admission.  On [**2140-9-6**], an ICD was placed by the
Electrophysiology service.

Pump - An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2140-9-6**].  The
echocardiogram revealed the left atrium and right atrium were
normal in size.  The left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function were normal with a left
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  Regional
left ventricular wall motion was normal.  Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion were normal.  The aortic
root was mildly dilated as was the ascending aorta.  The
aortic valve leaflets were structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion.  There was trace aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appeared structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.  There was mild mitral annular
calcification.  The tricuspid valve appeared structurally
normal with trivial tricuspid regurgitation.  There was
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There was
no pericardial effusion.

2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus:  Patient was placed on sliding
scale insulin during her stay in the Coronary Care Unit.  Her
oral diabetic medications were held on admission as she was
to be NPO for the procedure, and will not be eating her
normal home diet.

3. Hypercholesterolemia:  Patient was continued on her
statin.

4. Hypothyroidism:  Patient had normal TSH and free T4 on
admission.  She was continued on her home dose of
levothyroxine.

5. FEN:  Cardiac American Diabetic Association Diet.  Patient
has aggressive electrolyte repletion throughout the
admission.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient will be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Complete atrioventricular block status post ICD placement.
2. Syncope.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
4. Hypertension.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Hypothyroidism.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Levothyroxine 112 mcg p.o. q.d.
5. Percocet 1-2 tablets po q4-6h prn, 10 tablets dispensed.
6. Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. for three days.
7. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Metformin 1,000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn.
