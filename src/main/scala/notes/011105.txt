Chief Complaint:
bilateral complex cystic adnexal masses and thickened
endometrium

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p TAH-BSO [**2150-3-26**]

History of Present Illness:
58yo F with h/o DM2, obesity (270lbs), restrictive and
obstructive pulmonary disease on O2 at night and with exertion,
diastolic dysfunction with EF 65% (with 1+MR), renal
insufficiency, and OSA who underwent TAH for complex pelvic mass
and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for weaning of intubation. Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] had bilateral complex adnexal masses and a thickened
endometrium seen on pelvic ultrasound. She was evaluated by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5797**] and recommended to undergo a TAH and BSO for removal
and diagnosis of masses to r/o cancer. She underwent an
extensive pre-op evaluation, including evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
who recommended aggressive IS after the OR given her restrictive
disease. She underwent her TAH/BSO and was intubated in the OR
and because of her complicated medical status she was not
extubated post-surgery. Intraop pathology was benign.  She has
been admitted to the ICU for weaning off the ventilator.  On
arrival to the floor the patient wa intubated but awake and
initial risbi was <100 on PS 5/5. She complained of some pain at
the incision site which was relieved with IV morphine. She was
extubated and remained on 3L NC.
Review of sytems: As above.

PFTs [**2-18**]:
Her pulmonary function tests today continue to show moderate
restriction, albeit improved compared to her last visit.  Her
FEV1 is 61% of predicted at 1.32 liters.  Her FVC is 59% of
predicted, at 1.73 liters.  These values are actually up,
compared with the last two visits.

Brief Hospital Course:
58yo female with h/o restrictive (likely from obesity) and
obstructive pulmonary disease, diastolic CHF, OSA, morbid
obesity who underwent a uncomplicated TAH/BSO for intraoperative
benign disease on [**2150-3-26**]
.
# PostOp Care: The patient was initially transferred to the ICU
immediately post-operatively for monitoring of her fluid shifts
given her multiple medical co-morbidities.  She did well post op
and was transferred to the gyn floor on POD1.  The patient's
pain was initially controlled with a Dilaudid PCA until her diet
was advanced to regular.  At this time the patient was
transitioned to oral dilaudid.   The patient was ambulating
independently.  Physical therapy was consulted to assist the
patient with ambulation but she was doing well on her own.
.
# Restrictive Lung disease: The patient was extubated in arrival
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without complication.  She did well post-intubation
on O2 by NC. CPAP and 2L NC ordered for night per her home
regimen. Post-operative chest xray showed atelectasis vs.
aspiration, but no evidence of pneumonia. Home bronchodilators
were continued.  Respiratory therapy worked with the patient and
she received nebulizer treatments while in house.
.
#GU: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency.
I/O's were strictly monitored.  Fluid boluses were kept a
minimum.  Daily Cr was followed.  The patient's foley was
discontinued on post-operative day 5.  The patient voided
spontaneously.  Prior to discontinuation of foley catheter a
urine culture was sent.  The results of this are still pending
and will need to followed up on as an outpatient. At time of
discharge the patient's urine output was excellent and creatine
was at baseline.
.
# FEN/GI: Daily electrolytes and CBC were checked for the
patient.  Her electrolytes were repleated as needed.  Her diet
was gradually advanced to regular with passage of flatus.  At
time of discharge, the patient was tolerating a regular diet and
in good condition.
.
# CAD: Patient has a history of
