.
Cardiac cath showed left main disease (90% distal) that was not
intervened upon and poor LV function (EF 20%) and cardiac
surgery was consulted for CABG.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Moderate aortoiliac arterial disease.
.
ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include basal inferior akinesis and lateral
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT Chest
1. Heavy calcified aorta and its major branches including the
aneurysmatic dilatation of the brachiocephalic trunk.
2. Centrilobular emphysema, mild.
3. Subpleural areas of honeycombing suggesting long-standing
lung fibrosis such as IPF.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions right more than left, small.
5. Heavy coronary calcifications with insertion of the stent in
the LAD.
6. Status post cholecystectomy and gastroesophageal junction
surgery.
.
Abd Dopplers
1. Patent celiac and SMA arteries with slightly increased
systolic peak in the celiac axis. If there is clinical suspicion
for celiac axis stenosis, this could be better evaluated by MRA
or CTA.
2. Left-sided pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71M w/ CAD, DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, PVD p/w stuttering
CP, sent for cath and found to have left main disease. Carotid
u/s showed < 40% [**Country **], 50-60% [**Country **]. He underwent celiac and L
subclavian stenting on [**10-27**]. On [**2105-10-29**] he went to the
operating room where he underwent a CABG x 3. He was transferred
to the SICU in critical but stable condition. He awoke and was
extubated by POD #1. He was weaned from his nitroglycerine and
tansferred to the floor on POD #2. He did well post operatively.
He was seen by physical therapy. He was started on heparin and
coumadin for paroxysmal afib. He continued to have a sternal
click with no fevers, white count, drainage or erythema. He was
seen in consultation by cardiology for his continued bursts of
afib, they recommended continuing with lopressor,
anticoagulation, and increasing his ACE-I. He was ready for
discharge on [**11-8**].
