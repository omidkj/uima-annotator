Attending:[**Known firstname 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endograft repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 62-yo man w/ COPD and h/o PE presents from [**Hospital **]
hospital w/ abdominal pain and CTA suggestive of slight AAA leak
vs. mycotic anuersym. The patient was seen by his PCP [**2125-12-13**]
that started him on augmentin for cellulitis. He soon developed
right lower back/groin pain for 4 days. He was admitted to
[**Hospital3 10310**] [**2124-12-18**]. It was [**7-23**] started in the groin and
radiated to the back w/ burning with urination. He had a
non-infused CT that r/o renal stones but showed periortic
stranding around AAA. He was transferred to [**Hospital **] hospital.
Vascular surgeons there were not concerned for AAA leak and felt
that he likely had infection. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Of note one of his CTs also showed a perihilar mass that was
slightly enlarged from previous. (See Imaging section for
details)

On ROS, the patient denies
fevers/chills/CP/SOB/hematuria/melena/hematochezia. He still c/o
burning with urination.
.
On the floor, the patient had SBP 170s and [**7-23**] R back/flank
pain. He was treated with dilaudid w/ some relief and given
Metoprolol 25mg po. He was afebrile and blood cultures were
obtained.

Past Medical History:
- COPD, on 2L home O2
- frequent pneumonia
- h/o PE
- h/o EtOH dependence
- s/p RLL lobectomy [**2122**] for hamartoma

Social History:
Smokes [**12-15**] cigarettes / day currently, has >30-pack-year hx.
Also has remote h/o EtOH abuse, but does not drink currently.
Denies illicits.

Imaging:
[**2125-12-22**] CTA abd/pelvis:
1. Status post aortic stent placement in the infrarenal
abdominal aorta,
without evidence of active leak. 2. Periaortic inflammatory
changes surrounding the infrarenal aorta, similar in appearance
to prior study, could reflect infectious or inflammatory change/
vasculitis.
3. Mildly distended gallbladder, with either sludge or vicarious
excretion of contrast.  4. Severe emphysema within the
visualized lung bases.
5. Non-specific small free fluid in the pelvis, new from prior
study.
[**2125-12-21**] CTA abd/pelvis:
1. Interval progression of periaortic inflammatory change about
the
infrarenal aorta, now with perforation of the aorta and active
extravasation of contrast into an anterior area of leak.
2. Nasogastric tube terminating just beyond the gastroesophageal
junction,
this tube should be advanced. 3. Severe emphysema. 4. Biliary
sludge or vicarious excretion of contrast. 5. Intramuscular
lipoma.
[**2125-12-20**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded
due to suboptimal image quality. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations
seen
[**2125-12-20**] Abdominal x-ray: Dilated segment of small bowel. Review
of outside hospital CT shows fecalization of small bowel, as
well as possible transition points suggesting possible partial
closed loop obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62-M w/ COPD and recent exacerbation, recent RLE
cellulitis, p/w lower abdominal pain and right low back pain of
unclear etiology, txf to [**Hospital1 18**] given CT findings concerning for
slow AAA leak vs mycotic aneurysm.
.
#. Abdominal pain: The original etiology was mycotic aneurysm
vs. AAA leak. KUB was also concerning for partial SBO. An NG
tube was placed, but the patient's pain did not improve. On the
afternoon of [**2125-12-21**] patient developed worsening abdominal pain.
Vascular surgery was consulted, a CTA was obtained, and it
showed that the patient's AAA was leaking. He was taken
emergently to surgery.
.
# MRSA bacteremia: The patient was treated with vancomycin.
.
#. RLE cellulitis - seems resolved, on antibiotics.
.
#. COPD - On 2L home O2 via NC. Severe emphysema on OSH CT
scans. No acute pulm issues currently.
- albuterol / ipratropium nebs
- cont home Advair, Spiriva
- cont home supplemental O2

[**2125-12-21**] Patient had increased abdominal/back pain, stat
abdomen/pelvis CTA was done- showed interval progression of
periaortic inflammatory change about the
infrarenal aorta, now with perforation of the aorta and active
extravasation
of contrast into an anterior area of leak. Patient was pre-oped
and taken to endo suite and underwent EVAR. Patient tolerated
procedure, post-op patient was transferred to CV ICU intubated.
Was kept intubated and sedated overnight. Continued ABX.

[**2125-12-22**] POD1: Patient was weaned and extubated -> nasal
cannula. Nitro weaned off switched to Lopressor and Hydralazine.
Patient placed CIWA scale for hy of ETOH abuse, last drink 13
days prior. Transferred to the VICU [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 by the end of the
day. Continued ABX.

[**2125-12-23**] POD2: Remained in VICU, PO pain medicatios with decent
pain control. Continue CIWA scale. Repeat CT- showed no endo
leak. Low grade fever. Blood cultures came back positive for
MRSA, continued Vanco. ID consult placed-recommended IV Vanco
for 4 weeks. Tolerating POs and out of bed activity.

[**2125-12-24**] POD3: No acute events. Temperature now normalized.
Still having episodes fo abdominal/back pain that responds to
pain medication. Continued IV antibiotics. PICC line placed for
longterm antibiotics.
