History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95715**] is an 88 year old man with paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and atrial tachycardia which are now persistent,
coronary disease status post inferior MI in [**2092**], status post
dual-chamber pacemaker for impaired AV nodal conduction in [**Month (only) 116**]
[**2104**], and chronic kidney disease who presents today from
[**Hospital3 9475**] Care Center a HCT of 23.

HCT in the ED found to be 23*. EKG showed slow atrial
fibrillation without P waves, with atypical RBB, leftward axis,
and some T wave flattening in the precordium (normally has Twave
inversion across precordium). 2 large bore IVs placed. Guaiac
positive from below with black stool, assumed to be secondary to
the patient ingesting blood. The patient was consented for
blood, and a CXR showed a worsening and possibly loculated R
pleural effusion. He also received 1 U PRBC in the ED. At rehab,
his labs on [**11-19**] in the AM were notable for Cr 1.4, K 5, HCT of
23, INR 4.2

Of note, 3 weeks ago he was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital where
he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He was discharged to rehab
where he
has been for several weeks. While at rehab, he developed a
bloody nose from his right nares and has undergone packing which
needs to remain in place until Friday [**11-20**]. He had been
receiving amoxicllin clavulonic acid as part of his regime for
packing.

In the ED, initial VS: 99.3 95 123/62 18 99% 4L Nasal Cannula.
Labs were notable for: K 5.2, BUN 51, Cr 1.5 (baseline 1.6 since
[**2102**]), HCT 23.2* (baseline 34), MCV 99*, INR 4.5*. The patient
was given 1 g CeftriaXONE and 500 mg Azithromycin for a presumed
PNA. He was transfused 1 U PRBC, and sent up with a second unit.


Of note, for med changes, his Lasix has been decreased from 40
mg b.i.d. His metoprolol succinate 25 mg once a day is now
carvedilol 12.5 mg b.i.d. His lisinopril 2.5 mg was discontinued
recently as well.

He denies any lightheadedness or chest pain. No shortness of
breath. Does have a junky sounding cough.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for "chills" at night, a cough for
the past several days which has turned from dark red to a
tannish color, melena (black stool) for a week. Denies fever,
night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, sore throat,
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria. Denies dizziness or lightheadedness.

Past Medical History:
- Dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25% with chronic systolic
and
diastolic heart failure
- Mitral regurgitation status post bioprosthetic MVR,
- Persistent atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia
- Coronary artery disease status post IMI in [**2092**] with a most

[**2105-3-21**]
- Chronic kidney disease stage IV with baseline creatinine of
1.8
- Trigeminal neuralgia status post trigeminal nerve ablation
- Gastritis and duodenitis
- Orchiectomy for a testicular mass in [**2074**], and diverticulosis


Social History:
Social and family history were reviewed and remain unchanged. He
was living with his family, but is now at a rehab. He is a

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course .

88 year old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial
tachycardia which are now persistent, CAD s/p inferior MI in
[**2092**], status post dual-chamber pacemaker for impaired AV nodal
conduction in [**2105-3-21**], and CKD who p/w a GI bleed in the
setting of a supratherapeutic INR.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# HCT Drop/GI Bleed: Per pt report, has been having melanotic
stools over the past week. Also, due history of gastritis and
duodenitis, GI was consulted who performed an
[**Year (4 digits) 95785**] (EGD) once the patien was transferred
to the ICU so that he may receive MAC anesthesia. Pt is now s/p
4  units pRBCs and 2 units FFP. His aspirin and coumadin were
held for the duration of his hospitalization.  The EGD showed
gastritis and doudenitis with duodenal ulcer which was clean
based. H. Pylori serology was added and PPI continued.

# CAD: Patient denies any CP, but had elevated troponin at
0.14-0.16 x4, with a borderline normal CK-MB, although still
slightly elevated from prior. EKG shows some non-specific T wave
flatting, and patient denies chest pain, with troponemia
concerning for the demand in the setting of a low HCT. 2nd
troponin trending down. His home carvedilol and simvastatin were
continued, though aspirin was held.

# Elevated INR: Likely elevated in the setting of antibiotic
useage for Nasal packing as well as antibiotic usage for PNA as
treated at [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital 3 weeks ago. Antibiotics were held
during the admision, as well as warfarin.

# Hypoxemia: In the ED was treated as PNA, and has had PNA in
the past, but currently does not have WBC count or fever, but
does endorse productive sputum, though adequate sample was
unable to be obtained for culture. The Care referral form make a
note of an exudative R pleural effusion (possibly infectious,
now possibly loculated per report) at his OSH stay, which was
also found on chest x-ray here. Nasal packing that patient had
placed about 1 week prior to admission due to epistaxis was
removed on HD #1. Pt was also administered extra doses of lasix
due to the blood products he received so as not to fluid
overload him.

CHRONIC/INACTIVE ISSUES
# CKI: At baseline. No active issues.

# Dilated Cardiomyopathy with chronic systolic heart failure:
Not currently exhibiting signs of heart failure. Extra doses of
lasix given due to blood products he was supplied, as above. His
home carvedilol was continued.

# Nasal bleeding: Pt's nasal packing was removed on HD #1 prior
to t
