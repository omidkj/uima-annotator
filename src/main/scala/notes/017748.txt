MR Venogram:
1. Initial venogram demonstrated stenoses of the left
brachiocephalic vein. Based on the diagnostic findings, it was
decided that the patient would benefit from and was a good
candidate for angioplasty. The left brachiocephalic vein was
angioplastied to 10mm with acceptable angiographic result.
2. A 14.5-French 20-cm long cuff-to-tip tunneled dual-lumen
hemodialysis catheter was placed via the left subclavian vein
with tip in the right atrium. The catheter can be used
immediately.
3. Successful placement of a 8.5-French x 16 cm quadruple-lumen
central venous catheter with by way of the right common femoral
vein with tip in the right common iliac vein. The catheter can
be used immediately.
.
MR [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18371**]:
IMPRESSION: Large amount of subcutaneous and intramuscular edema
within the left [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18371**] as described, without drainable fluid
collection. Findings are nonspecific yet could be related to
postsurgical change, however superimposed infection cannot be
excluded.
.
Echo:
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation
present.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Bone marrow biopsy:
Non-specific lymphoid profile; no phenotypic evidence of
increased myeloblasts or of lymphoma is seen in this limited
panel.  correlation with clinical findings and morphology (see
separate report) is recommended.  Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect [**Doctor Last Name **] lymphomas due to topography,
sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.  Please refer to
S06-571.
.
MR Chest:
CONCLUSION:
1. Normal flow demonstrated in the right or left internal
jugular veins, moderate narrowing of the stented left
brachiocephalic vein, but the SVC and left subclavian veins
remain patent.
2. Thin linear potential filling defect within the left
subclavian vein could represent partially duplicated venous
system or non occlusive thrombus. Direct correlation with
ultrasound is advised.
.
CXR:
1. Clear lungs.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 45 yo m with type 1 DM c/b esrd on dialysis,
and mult other medical problems who presents with hyperglycemia,
and hyperkalemia.

# ESRD on HD:
ESRD with HD Tu, Th, Sat.  The patient was originally admitted
because of access issues w/ his AV fistula.  Venogram of the
fistula revealed significant stenosis of the fistula and
renal/transplant/IR have all been coordinating care to arrange
alternative access. A MR venogram was obtained to better
evaluate the central venous structures prior to planning his
access.  In the meantime, the patient had a tunnelled groin HD
catheter that was used.  However, on [**2158-11-24**] the patient became
acutely febrile to 104.  At this time, renal and IR were
consulted and the decision was made to remove his groin HD
catheter and to obtain only a temporary PICC w/out further HD
access.  Renal was comfortable with the patient missing his
scheduled Saturday HD session and planned to readdress his
access issue on [**11-27**].  Because of access issues, a L femoral HD
graft was placed.  This procedure was, unfortunately,
complicated by persistent fevers.  His blood cultures grew MDR
klebsiella only sensitive to meropenem from the 15-17th.
Despite abx he continued to be febrile for the next week.  An
MRI of the L [**Month/Day (4) 18371**] showed no abscess but a WBC scan showed
increased uptake at the site of the graft.  Because of this,
transplant removed the L [**Month/Day (4) 18371**] graft on [**12-15**].  He went w/out HD
for the week and then access was established with a new temp
cath triple lumen VIP line in the R groin on [**12-18**], and a triple
lumen catheter in the R groin on [**12-26**].  Patient has been
receiving meropenem through the triple lumen post-HD.  HD is
currently being done using the L subclavian HD tunneled
catheter.

# Klebsiella cellulitis:
Transplant surgery and wound care were following and caring for
L groin wounds inhouse.  The cellulitis over L groin has greatly
improved in erythema, edema
