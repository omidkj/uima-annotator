History of Present Illness:
61 yo M with hypertension, COPD, alcoholism (unclear if active),
possible schizophrenia was admitted overnight through the ED.
His ability to relate a consistent hx is currently impaired, but
per prior notes, it seems that he was told by his neighbor to
come to the hospital as he appeared short of breath.  The
initial assessment of ED staff was that the pt was massively
fluid overloaded in the setting of CHF and non-compliance with
lasix. He was treated with Lasix IV 40mg x 2, ASA 325 and nitro,
although no chest pain and EKG . Further review of OMR reveals
that the pt is no on lasix and has no clinical hx of CHF, last
echo in [**2119**] showed preserved LVEF of 55 with only mild Ao
dilation.
.
Initial labs were notable for Na of 116 with K of 6.6 (initial
7.8 was hemolyzed) and CR 2.7; no EKG changes. LFTs elevated AST
120, ALT 50, with bili 4.5, INR 1.6, albumin 2.6. With one dose
of kayexalate, potassium has trended down to 5.3. Serial
troponins 0.04. Initial CK 700 trending down with minimal MB
fraction.
.
In terms of his mental status, his PCP saw him one month ago at
which point he was at baseline A&OX3, independent for all ADLs.
MS not in ED not clearly documented. At 8AM this morning, he
trigerred for tachypnea with RR close to 30 and worsened MS
A&Ox1 only to self. [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU. On
arrival, pt was on 2L and confused/somnolent. His audible
wheezing, tachypnea, and hypoxia improved rapidly with
albuterol. MS improved slightly when taken off supplemental O2.
ABG on room air: 7.4/35/73.

ROS: Denies any pain but unable to provide detailed ROS.

IMAGING:
[**2124-12-5**]:
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Low lung volumes and
body habitus
limits the film. Heart size is probably top normal. There is
right hilar
fullness and a prominent azygous vein suggested volume overload.
Retrocardiac opacification may be dud to suboptimal film. No
pneumothorax. Recommend convention PA and lateral with
encouraged increased respiratory effort.

[**2124-12-5**]:
CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to patient motion without
evidence of
gross acute intracranial abnormality. Global diffuse atrophy

[**2124-12-5**]:
CT Chest Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited examination secondary to patient
body habitus
and lack of intravenous contrast.
1. Nodular liver suggestive of cirrhosis. Splenomegaly, likely
indicative of portal hypertension.
2. Mild intra-abdominal ascites.
3. Mild centrilobular emphysema.
4. Cholelithiasis.

[**2124-12-11**]:
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of bilateral lower lobe consolidations
with air
bronchograms concerning for aspiration pneumonia. Diffuse ground
glass
opacity throughout both lungs is also identified and may
represent
superimposed pulmonary edema.
2. Interval development of
