History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 24 y/o F with h/o ESRD, HTN who started
peritoneal dialysis during the week of [**2141-10-8**] and presented
with a 1 day history of acute onset N/V, sharp abdominal pain on
[**2141-10-13**]. (Of note, the patient had presented to the ED on
[**10-11**] with hypotension, SBPs in the 80s off after approximately
1.5L was taken off during dialysis in the setting of taking her
PO Anti-HTNs. On [**2141-10-11**] she received 0.5L IVF, labs WNL, and
was d/c'd home).  On the day of admission on [**2141-10-13**], the
patient reported that the previous night, she was awoken from
sleep with severe, sharp abdominal pain, 6 episodes of frothy
emesis, 10+ yellowish BMs without melena or BRBRP.She was
admitted for further work- up of this abdminal pain.
.
In the ED here vitals were as follows: T: 97.0 HR: 101 BP:
240/180 RR: 17 O2sat: 100%RA.  She received Labetolol 20mg IV
and was subsequently placed on a labetolol drip.  She also
received ceftriaxone 1gm IV, Flagyl 500mg IV, Dilaudid 0.5-1mg
IV q1hr and Zofran. Her abdominal CT showed multifocal areas of
small bowel wall thickening. Her peritoneal Cell count was
negtaive for SBP. She had some signs of peritonitis and thus
surgery was consulted. Her lactate was normal.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU the patient was mentating well with
complaints of diffuse sharp abdominal pain that radiated to the
back and diarrhea.  She had no headache or visual changes.

Blood cultures: all negative

EKG ([**2141-10-13**]): Sinus rhythm. Findings are within normal limits.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-10-2**] there is no
significant diagnostic change.

CXR ([**2141-10-13**]): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. No free
air under the diaphragms.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2141-10-13**]): There is a moderate-sized
pericardial
effusion, similar in appearance from [**2141-10-13**]. The great
vessels are normal in caliber, without aneurysmal dilatation.
Evaluation of the great vessels is limited without IV contrast.

Interstitial thickening, particularly within the perihilar
regions, is
suggestive of fluid overload. There is bibasilar atelectasis
with a small
focus of consolidation in the right lower lobe (2:35) unchanged
from [**2141-10-13**], and may reflect aspiration or pneumonia. Scattered
bilateral nodules are largely stable from as far back as
[**2139-10-9**]. Specifically, there is a 5 mm nodule in the right
middle lobe (2:25), two adjacent nodules in the right lower lobe
measuring 5 mm and 2 mm (2:24), and a 4 mm pleural based nodule
within the left lower lobe. A nodular density seen adjacent and
anterior to the right main pulmonary artery (2:23) may reflect a
vessel. There is a small right pleural effusion.

Axillary lymphadenopathy, with axillary nodes measuring up to
approximately 10 mm in short axis, is seen. Ill- defined soft
tissue thickening within the hilus bilaterally may reflect hilar
lymphadenopathy, but assessment is limited without IV contrast.
A catheter is visualized within the visualized right upper
extremity, which may reflect a PICC line that terminates within
the right subclavian vein.

The esophagus is distended and filled with contrast, with marked
wall
thickening and edema throughout its entire length, a new
finding. There is a moderate- sized hiatal hernia.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There has been interval
development of a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air,
that layers anteriorly and along the anterior abdominal wall.
Additional small clustered foci of extraluminal air is seen
adjacent to the proximal stomach and the gastroesophageal
junction, with a focus of air tracking into the fissure of
ligamentum venosum. Additionally, there appears to be air
tracking into the anterior subcutaneous tissues in the region of
the umbilicus. These findings are all new from the prior CT on
[**2141-10-13**], but free air was present on chest radiograph performed
[**2141-10-25**]. There is no obvious evidence of extravasation of oral
contrast into the peritoneum. Of note, a peritoneal dialysis
catheter is in place that could represent a route of entry of
intraperitoneal air.

The stomach, small bowel, and colon are filled with contrast,
without evidence of obstruction. Evaluation for wall thickening
is limited without IV contrast.

Limited non-contrast views of the liver demonstrates a rounded
1.6 cm x 1.2 cm hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver,
previously characterized as a hemangioma. The liver is otherwise
unremarkable. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
glands demonstrate no gross abnormality. Both kidneys are
atrophic. Evaluation of solid organs is limited by lack of IV
contrast.

There is a peritoneal dialysis catheter, coiled within the
pelvis, unchanged.  There
