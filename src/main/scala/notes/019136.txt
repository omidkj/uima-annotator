Pertinent Results:
Labs day of transfer to floor:
Microbiology Data:
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2179-6-12**]): >25 PMNs and >10 epithelial
cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2179-6-9**]): NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES
SEEN. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

Imaging:
CTA [**2179-6-12**]:
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
2. Increased patchy consolidation at the right lung base, with
small
bilateral pleural effusions, concerning for sequelae of
aspiration,
particularly given recent surgery.
3. Severe emphysema.
4. Pulmonary nodules noted on the recent chest CT are not
well-visualized
given new consolidation and pleural effusion, followup as
recommended by the prior CT.
5. Stable low-density lesions in the left adrenal gland.
.
Most recent CXR portable  [**2179-6-12**]: Patient is status post
sternotomy with intact wires. Patient is status post CABG
surgery. Epidural catheter is in place.  Severe emphysema
predominantly in upper lobes are unchanged. Unchanged appearance
of consolidation in the right lung base. Improvement of the left
lung base consolidation. Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
Heart size is within normal limits.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 1124**] is a 67M w h/o CAD with CABG, COPD, PVD, with a right
tibia sarcoma. He was electively taken to surgery and underwent
resection with press fit and cemented allograft prosthetic
composite.  He was imediately extubated but in the PACU
developed respiratory distress and was reintubated requiring
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission.   Etiology of respiratory failure most likely
underlying COPD (on home oxygen at home) and new aspiration
pneumonia. Treated COPD with standing nebulizers. Started
Levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia (Day 1 [**2179-6-12**]). Maintained
diuresis goal - 1 L daily (with lasix). Patient tolerated
extubation [**6-10**] and was weaned to NC 5 L at time of
transfer to floor.

An epidural was placed preoperatively and removed [**2179-6-13**]. At
discharge his pain was controlled on oxycontin 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
dilaudid prn for breakthrough. He did require 3 units pRBC
maintain a HCT > 30.
After transfer to the floor his drain was discontinued when it
was putting out minimal output and he was placed in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6587**]
brace and was allwoed to range the knee from 0-30*.  He recieved
physiotherapy and was up out of bed with a walker and mobilizing
well.  Prior to discharge his foley was discontinued and he was
voiding.
He recieved lovenox 40mg subcutaneously for DVT prophylaxis.
