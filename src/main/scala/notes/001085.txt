Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5037**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line [**2165-6-3**]


History of Present Illness:
77 y.o. female with PMHx of PCKD and PCLD (s/p bil native
nephrectomy and liver dissection) and s/p cadaveric renal
transplant in [**2155**] with past history of multiple abd surgeries
including rectopexy for irreducible rectal prolapse on [**2165-3-27**]
presented to the ED with increasing shortness of breath. Patient
reports becoming acutely short of breath on the night prior to
admission. On the following day, she was hypertensive to 199/90
with a mild headache and noted a temperature of 99. She also
noted profound weakness and thus came into the ER for further
evaluation. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, fevers,
recent sick contacts or travel.

In the ED, vitals were T 99.5, P 76, BP 183/75, RR 25, O2: 77%
on RA, 96% [**Date Range 597**]. O2 sats began to trend down on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was
eventually switched to CPAP. Given the hypoxia, a CXR was
ordered which showed bibasilar PNA and CHF. BNP was elevated to
53,163. Patient was also noted to have a distended abdomen,
concerning for SBO. KUB showed no ileus or obstruction. Surgery
was consulted and felt that there were no acute surgical issues
and that a CT scan of the abdomen could be performed if there
were increasing concern for obstruction. Given the CXR findings,
patient was started on Levofloxacin. She was additionally given
a dose of Flagyl for concern of an intrabdominal process. She
was then admitted to the ICU for PNA/CHF.

Pertinent Results:
[**5-22**]: Portable Abdomen:
FINDINGS: A single portable AP view of the abdomen is obtained
which excludes the upper abdomen. Multiple surgical clips are
again noted in the mid abdomen which are unchanged from prior
study. There has been interval removal of the skin staples. The
bowel gas pattern is nonspecific, though demonstrates no
definite evidence of ileus or obstruction. The abdominal aorta
is calcified and appears tortuous. Visualized osseous structures
are unremarkable.

[**5-22**]: Abdominal US:
FINDINGS: Limited four quadrant views of the abdomen demonstrate
large amount of simple-appearing ascites in all four quadrants,
including the right perihepatic space.

[**5-22**]: Chest x-ray
FINDINGS: Two bedside frontal views labeled "upright at 12:50,
1:00 p.m." with lordotic positioning, are compared with most
recent study dated [**2165-4-15**]. There is dense retrocardiac opacity
with air bronchograms and obscuration of that hemidiaphragm,
likely representing combination of consolidation and effusion,
new. There is also further patchy opacity at the right lung
base; this process is likely pneumonic. There is cardiomegaly
with pulmonary vascular congestion and blurring and small
bilateral pleural effusions. Noted are numerous surgical clips
in the upper abdomen, particularly on the right and a right
shoulder arthroplasty.

[**5-23**]: Chest x-ray
IMPRESSION:
1. Increasing right lung consolidation suggesting worsening
infection.
2. Increasing left basilar opacity possibly representing a
combination of atelectasis and effusion, although infection
cannot be excluded.

[**5-23**]: Abdominal US
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent hepatic vessels with normal directional flow.
2. Numerous cysts throughout the liver.
3. Dilated extrahepatic common bile duct measuring 16 mm in
greatest dimension.

[**5-23**]: ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-3-26**],
left ventricular diastolic function has worsened. The amounts of
mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and estimated
pumonary artery systolic pressure have increased.

[**5-27**]: CT Torso
FINDINGS: There is severe scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
Consecutive asymmetry of the rib cage. Multicystic liver
disease. In the thorax, the right-sided pleural effusion has a
diameter of 5.2 mm at its largest size. Considerably smaller
left-sided pleural effusion. The most remarkable finding in the
lung parenchyma is a right-sided extensive perihilar opacity
with air bronchograms and central consolidations. This opacity
has a subtle ground- glass halo and several satellite lesions.
At the apex and the base of the right lung, linear areas of
atelectasis are seen. _Areas of hypoventilation at the lung
bases. Calcification of the mediastinal vessels, no
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female with extensive PMH who was admitted with PNA
and pulmonary edema, requiring non-invasive ventilation.  She
was initially in the intensive care unit until her breathing
status improved.

In the ICU, the patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and received
antibiotics for her PNA. Initially, she was on BiPAP but
improved throughout her course of stay until she was saturating
comfortably on room air. On admission the patient had a surgical
eval for abdominal distention which resolved w/o intervention,
her imaging was negative for SBO. She was transferred to the
floor for further management.

On exam, the patient had dyspnea and fever felt most likely
secondary to a factor of both CHF and PNA noted on CXR.  The
patient was treated with levofloxacin for a likely community
acquired pneumonia.  She was also treated initially with IV
Lasix as her xray seemed consistent with a degree of heart
failure.

The patient has a history of multiple SBOs in the setting of
numerous abdominal surgeries. She denied any vomiting, though
she did have some mild nausea at the beginning of her
hospitalization.  Her last BM was the day before admission and
she denies passing flatus since. She says that her current
abdominal distention is not comparable to previous SBOs. Of
note, she was started on iron supplements approximately on
