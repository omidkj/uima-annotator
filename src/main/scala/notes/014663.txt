Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased ostomy output and worsening renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-2-21**]: lower extremity angiogram
[**2129-2-22**]: Right femoral endarterectomy with dacron interposition
graft
[**2129-3-2**]: Placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter


History of Present Illness:
67M with complicated GI history of peritonitis/volvulus
resulting in surgery with ileostomies who presented to OSH
([**Hospital1 **]) with dehydration from high ostomy output and was found
to be in acute renal failure felt secondary to dehydration.

[**Hospital3 **] course: Patient received aggressive IV hydration
with normal saline and then HCO3 gtt with improvement in his
HCO3 from 11 -> 18 and in BUN from 98 -> 79 (creatinine 7.1 ->
7.3). Seen by the renal c/s team and felt to have ATN secondary
to dehydration. UOP 300cc in 24 hours prior to transfer. U/A
showed E. coli and Proteus growing. Initally he was hypotensive
(lowest SBP in 80s), but BPs stabilized with hydration. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for acute renal failure and possbile
revision of ielostomy once stable.

On the floor, patient is feeling fairly well. He is on O2 but
denies SOB with the oxygen. Does not feel confused or tremulous.
No pain. No ostomy output since arrival. Has Foley in place.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Has lost about 50lbs
since the summer. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea
or congestion. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes. Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin breakdown. No
numbness/tingling in extremities. No feelings of depression or
anxiety. All other review of systems negative.


Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p MI in [**2111**], medically managed
- Systolic CHF (last echo 25% per OSH report)
- Pacemaker/AICD placed [**2124**]
- PVD s/p multiple arterial surgeries to lower extremities and
left great toe amputation
- Type II diabetes mellitus (recent weight loss has led to
greatly improved glycemic control)
- Hypertension
- Atrial fibrillation on warfarin
- Status post TURP for urinary retention


Social History:
Previously lived at home with his wife, but recently has been
living in [**Hospital1 1501**]. Has 3 grown children and 3 [**Doctor Last Name **] children who
were recently returned to their biological parents. Still smokes
(history of 1.5 ppd x many decades, but since moving to [**Hospital1 1501**] only
1 pack per week because it is hard to find time). No alcohol or
recreational drugs. Retired engineer.

Imaging:

CXR [**2129-2-7**]:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2128-11-1**]:
AP projection, comparable to [**2128-11-1**] shows new mild
cardiomegaly.  Lateral view shows small pleural effusions,
presumably new but too small to appreciate on single frontal
projection if present previously. There is no pulmonary edema.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead tip
projects over the apex of the right ventricle. The proximal
electrode spans the superior vena cava and right atrium.
Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, though normal caliber.
Lateral view shows longstanding calcification on the
diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle, probably a
postinfarction scar, conceivably pseudoaneurysm. Small pleural
effusions are comparable in size to the volume of pleural fluid
in [**Month (only) **]. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

ECG [**2129-2-8**]:
Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Intraventricular conduction defect. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2128-11-1**] demand ventricularly paced rhythm is no
longer present.

ECG [**2129-2-11**]:
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The axis
is indeterminate. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2129-2-9**] the rate is faster and left
bundle-branch block is new.

CXR [**2129-2-11**]:
FINDINGS: A defibrillator is unchanged in position. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are new. Bibasilar atelectasis has
increased. The
