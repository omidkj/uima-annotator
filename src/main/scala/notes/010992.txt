History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with PMH sig for COPD s/p recent intubation,
anxiety/depression, gerd, psorisasis presented to [**Hospital 16843**]
Hospital on [**2157-2-4**] with weakness, dehydration and nausea.
Prior to initial presentation, he was intubated at [**Hospital 16843**]
Hospital for COPD exacerbation/PNA. He had a Right SC line at
that time.  He was found to have MRSA sepsis requiring Levophed.
On [**2-7**] he was found to have staph endopthamitis. He underwent
vitreous injection with vanco and amikacin. Also noted right toe
pain thought to be secondary to  SBE.  Blood cultures postitive
for MRSA from [**2-4**] through [**2-12**]. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2157-2-12**] his Vanc level was noted to be 7.7 and he had initially
been admitted to the MICU at the [**Hospital1 18**].  In [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, he
initially required Epinephrine and NS boluses for pressure
support. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test WNL.  He was re-admitted to the ICU on
[**2-24**] after an episode of hypotension and rigors which had
responded to IVF and went to the CCU on [**2-25**] for concern of
endocarditis and abcess for further monitering.  On [**2-28**] he
underwent AV reconstruction, MVR and aortic arch reconstruction.
 His subsequent course has been complicated by right sided PNA
and hypotension.  He is being called out of MICU on [**2157-3-18**].

** Cardiac Studies **
TEE [**2157-2-14**]:
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed.
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
4.The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely
thickened/deformed. While the views are limited, there maybe a
small mobile (<0.3 cm) mass which may be a vegetations on the
aortic valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
TTE [**2157-2-14**]:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic
valve is not well seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trace mitral
regurgitation seen.
5.There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  No echocardiographic
evidence of endocarditis.
.
TTE  [**2157-2-24**]:
1. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. LV systolic
function appears depressed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. A
mobile, moderate sized mass is probably present on the aortic
valve with a possible aortic annular abscess. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5. There is a small pericardial effusion.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2157-2-14**], the aortic mass and possible abscess are new.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2157-2-25**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
single
vessel coronary artery disease. The left main coronary artery,
LAD, and
LCX had no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses. The
RCA
had a 60% stenosis in the mid vessel.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling
pressures
(mean RA pressure was 5 mm Hg and RVEDP was 7 mm Hg). Pulmonary
artery
pressures were normal (PA pressure was 27/16 mm Hg). Left sided
filling
pressures were low (mean PCW pressure was 5 mm Hg). Cardiac
index was
normal (at 4.8 L/min/m2). Central arterial pressures were low
(aortic
pressure was 84/53 mm Hg).
3. The aortic valve was not crossed secondary to the aortic
valve
vegetation.
.
TEE [**2157-2-25**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root, the ascending
aorta, the descending aorta, and the abdominal aorta. There are
complex (>4mm and/or mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed with
fusion of the left and right aor
