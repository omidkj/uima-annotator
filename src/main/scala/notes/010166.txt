Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective LN biopsy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EBUS tracheal lymph node biopsy


History of Present Illness:
80 yo M with h/o CAD s/p 3 vessel CABG, afib,
obstructive/restrictive lung dz presents to the medicine service
from the SICU after transbronchial biopsy for hilar mass
complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, SOB, and acute
hypertension. Patient originally presented for EBUS with
transbronchial biopsy of known hilar mass. The procedure was
performed without incident. However, the patient's
post-procedure course was complicated by hypercarbia and SOB,
which necessitated observation in the SICU. His pCO2 was 87 at
that time. He was oxygenated with BiPAP eventually weaning him
to to 1L NC. His pCO2 decreased to the mid 50s. He maintained
his oxygenation throughout. However, during this course, the
patient became hypertensive. Given his extensive history of
heart disease, the patient was ruled out for MI. The patient
also has known afib but had not been anticoagulated given the
recent procedure.
.
On transfer to the floor, the patient was in good spirits. He
did not complain of any residual pain, though he did have blood
tinged sputum. His BP was stable at 125/42.

CXR:
FINDINGS: Compared with 11/20, allowing for interval development
of atelectasis at the left base medially, no obvious significant
interval change in the small left pleural effusion is
appreciated. The right lung is clear. The right CPA is not
included on this film.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M with h/o CAD/CABG, afib, HTN, lung dz with perihilar
mass, s/p transbronchial biopsy complicated by hypercarbia and
HTN, who presented from the SICU for post-procedure management
and observation.
.
P:
Nodule s/p biopsy. A bronchoscopy was performed with sampling of
the mediastinal lymph nodes, and bronchial washings were
obtained as well. Patient's biopsy results were still pending at
time of discharge.
.
Anemia: Pt had acute hematocrit drop after the procedure, likely
secondary to acute blood loss anemia. He had an active type and
screen. His hematocrit stabilized two days after the procedure.
He was advised to restart his coumadin on discharge.
.
SOB/hypercarbia/s/p biopsy: Patient likely had hypercarbic
respiratory failure secondary to oversedation, initially but had
persistent hypoxia after discharge to the floor which was felt
to be secondary to baseline restrictive and obstructive lung
disease, with also component of anemia and recent bronchoscopy
with resultant atelectasis. This improved through the course of
the day, and on discharge, patient was oxygenating well on room
air on discharge, although had desaturation to 88-90% with
ambulation. Most recent ABG demonstrated CO2 in the mid 50's. He
had negative cardiac enzymes, and his EKG was unremarkable, as
was his repeat CXR. He was restarted on his home lasix dose on
discharge. He was ruled out for an MI in the SICU with negative
cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes. He was discharged to home
with home oxygen due to patient concern about hypoxia, despite
good oxygen saturations while in the hospital.
.
His atrial fibrillation was rate controlled and stable. His
coumadin dose was held during admission. For his CAD and
hypertension, his lisinopril dose was uptitrated.
.
He was discharged to home with followup.
