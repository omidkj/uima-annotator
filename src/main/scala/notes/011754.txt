Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44 year-old male
dentist with no prior history of cardiac disease who
presented to [**Hospital6 3872**] after approximately
one week history of dyspnea on exertion.  He experienced no
chest pain at that time.  His electrocardiogram on admission
to the outside hospital revealed some ST changes.  He ruled
in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes with a cardiac
troponin I of 13.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] where he underwent cardiac
catheterization, which revealed pulmonary artery pressures of
70/36.  He had a right coronary artery 100%, proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery lesion 100%, circumflex
lesion as well as a diffusely diseased obtuse marginal.  He
had left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%.  Intra-aortic
balloon pump was inserted at that time.

Cardiothoracic surgery consult was obtained and the patient
was taken to the Operating Room on [**2181-1-9**] by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Please see operative report for full details
of the surgical procedure.  The patient underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times four with a plication of his left
ventricular aneurysm.  The patient had left internal mammary
coronary artery graft to the left anterior descending
coronary artery, saphenous vein to the obtuse marginal and a
sequential saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery and the PL.  Chest was closed with attempted
chest closure.  In the Operating Room the patient became
profoundly hypotensive with systolic blood pressure dropping
to the 40s.  He did not have ST changes on the cardiac
monitor.  His pulmonary artery pressures rose.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed an akinetic left
ventricular with no response to epinephrine initially.  The
chest was reopened.  The patient was placed back on
cardiopulmonary bypass to stabilize him.  Attempt to come off
bypass pump three additional times were unsuccessfully due to
hemodynamic instability, elevated pulmonary artery pressures
and diminished systemic blood pressure.  The patient at that
time was on multiple inotropics and vasopressors as well as
an intra-aortic balloon pump.

The decision was made at that time to consult Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for placement of ventricular assist device.  An Aveomed
BVS left ventricular assist device was placed in the
Operating Room at that time.  The ventricular assist device
flows were fairly consistent at about 4.5 liters per minute.
His chest was left open at that time.  The patient separated
from bypass and transferred to the Cardiothoracic Care Unit
on low dose Levophed as well as Dobutamine at 2.5 micrograms
per kilogram per minute.  Over the course of the night the
patient had one episode where he had significant clot and
blood accumulation in the chest with bulging of his chest
dressing and hemodynamic instability with systemic
hypotension as well as significantly elevated right sided
heart pressures with a CVP up to the 30s.  He also decreased
VAD flows requiring correction necessitating opening of the
esmarch and evacuation clot and blood in the chest around the
heart.

During that time the patient had some hemodynamic instability
with hypotension and systolic pressure to the 60s.  It was
treated with very low doses of intravenous calcium chloride
and intravenous fluid boluses of normal saline as well as
packed red blood cells.  The patient subsequently recovered
fairly quickly from this episode after the chest was
reexplored.  The esmarch was then closed.  The patient was
briefly placed on intravenous nitroprusside.  Due to
hypertension with a mean arterial pressure of greater then
100, which caused decreased flows of the VAD to the 2.5 liter
per minute range.  The patient quickly responded to the
afterload reduction.  The VAD flows increased and the patient
became hemodynamically stable.  Throughout the course of the
night the patient remained hemodynamically stable with a
fairly high volume requirement as determined by the
assessments of the VAD bladders as well as the flow on the
ventricular assist device and systemic blood pressure.

The patient remains on Dobutamine at 2.5 micrograms per
kilogram per minute.  It was felt due to the patient's age,
patient's lack of comorbities and the patient significantly
decreased heart function that he be assessed at [**Hospital 8503**] for heart transplants.  During the course of
the night the patient had a left femoral arterial line
removed due to an enlarging hematoma in that area.  Manual
compression was felt for thirty minutes.  The hematoma was
significantly decreased in size at the end of this and the
patient has clear doppler signals both dorsalis pedis pulse
as well as posterior tibial in the left foot.  Also due to
inability to adequately time and trigger the intra-aortic
balloon pump, because of the left ventricular assist device,
the intra-aortic balloon pump was also removed, which was in
the right femoral artery as well as the right femoral venous
line were both discontinued during the night.  Manual
pressure was held to that groin as well for approximately
thirty minutes with no outward sign of bleeding and the
patient also continued with strong doppler signals in the
right foot as well.

The patient is presently hemodynamically stable.  He has also
evidenced that he has awoken up after his surgical procedure.
 He had followed commands.  He had moved all four extremities
to command.  Once his neurologic status was assessed he was
placed on intravenous cisatracurium to paralyze him to
decrease any work load on the heart as well as respiratory
effort and oxygenation need.  He was also placed on
intravenous morphine and intravenous propofol drips for
sedation while he was being paralyzed.

The patient's condition right now is as follows:  The
patient's blood pressure is running from 80 systolic to one
teen systolic.  He has ventricular assist device flows in the
4 to 5 liter per minute range.  Neurologically the patient is
completely sedated.  His pulmonary status is stable on full
ventilatory support.  His FIO2 is down to 50% and he is on
sinus PEEP with an adequate blood gas and adequate
oxygenation.  His chest remains open.  He has bilateral
pleural chest tubes in as well as two mediastinal chest
tubes.  He has VAD cannulas also and esmarch to the chest
with an Ioban dressing covering the esmarch.  His abdominal
examination is benign.  He is obese, nondistended with no
bowel sounds audible.  The patient's extremities are warm
with doppler signals in both feet.  The patient is being
transferred to [**Hospital 4415**] Intensive Care Unit
to await transplant.  He is being transferred to the care of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37994**] cardiothoracic surgeon at [**Hospital 10908**].  Please contact the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service
