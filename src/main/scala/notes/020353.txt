Service:  [**Company 191**]/MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old woman with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
status post splenectomy; history of colon cancer, status post
hemicolectomy, who presented to the Emergency Department with
five days of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

In [**2104-12-28**], the patient presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 10804**]
office with a nonproductive cough.  Chest x-ray showed no
infiltrates, chronic layered densities of the left lung base
and a fine reticular pattern at the right lung base were also
appreciated.  She received a five day course of azithromycin
with improvement.

Approximately five days prior to admission she developed a
cough productive of yellow sputum, fevers to 101 degrees,
night sweats and chills.  She also had decreased p.o. intake,
postural lightheadedness, and dizziness.  She was nauseous.
She had no vomiting or abdominal pain.  Her last bowel
movement was three days prior to admission.  She denied
dysuria or increased urinary frequency.  She had not traveled
recently.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CLL non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2094**].  She underwent
melphalan/prednisone therapy from [**2096-6-27**] to [**2097-6-27**] and then in [**2097-2-27**] pulmonary nodules were
appreciated and treated with CHOP chemotherapy.  She had a
recurrence of lymphoma in [**2097**]-[**2098**] in the jaw and orbit,
status post [**Hospital1 **] protocol.
2.  History of hypogammaglobulinemia (required monthly
infusions, the last one was one year ago, however).
3.  Status post hemicolectomy in [**2105-3-28**] for T3, N1, M0
colon cancer.  No chemotherapy was done at that time.
4.  Status post splenectomy in [**2086**] with indications unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] last Pneumovax was in [**2095-4-28**].
5.  History of Hemophilus influenzae bronchitis.
6.  Interstitial pneumonitis with underlying lymphomatous
lung infiltration.
7.  History of SVC clot in [**2104-3-28**], likely related to
her Port-A-Cath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
100.6, blood pressure 108/58, pulse 96, respiratory rate 36,
oxygen saturation 94% to 99% on 4 liters.  Generally, she was
awake and alert.  her breathing was slightly labored.  HEENT:
She was anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.  Neck:
Supple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Heart:
Tachycardiac, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  There
were no extra sounds.  Lungs:  Crackles diffusely extending
one-third of the way up.  There was no egophony.  There was
no fremitus.  Abdomen:  Normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  The liver edge and spleen were not palpable.
Extremities:  She had trace pitting edema with normal
capillary refill.  There was no cyanosis.

LABORATORY DATA UPON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count
12.7, hematocrit 33.8, platelets 268,000.  The INR was 1.2.

The chest x-ray showed multiple patchy opacities in the right
lower lobes and left lower lobes consistent with focal
consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a prolonged Intensive Care
Unit stay, during which she received a 14 day course of
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin to treat her pneumonia.  Toward
the end of her MICU stay, she started to develop diarrhea.
She was empirically treated for five days with metronidazole
with resolution of diarrhea.

The MICU stay was also complicated by hypotension
necessitating multiple fluid boluses.  The patient became
grossly edematous; however, blood pressure was maintained
above 100 systolic for the duration of her course.

Cosyntropin stimulation testing revealed adrenal
insufficiency.  The patient was started on hydrocortisone
stress dose with progressive taper.  Diuresis was then
achieved with furosemide; however, the patient had
significant hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia, both
electrolytes were repleted without complication.

On [**2105-2-25**], the patient was transferred to the
floor.  She had no complaints but was slightly confused about
where she was.  She recognized her family members and was
able to answer questions ....................

The physical examination was significant for +3 upper
extremity and lower extremity edema.  There was good
capillary refill.  The limbs were weeping in several places.
The vascular examination was normal.  The neurological
examination showed a mental status that was slightly
confused.  She was oriented to person and time.  She spoke in
three to four word sentences.  Cranial nerves II, III, IV,
and VI were normal, that is the pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  The extraocular
movements were intact without nystagmus.  Cranial nerves V
and VII were normal, that is the face was symmetric with
intact sensation in all three distributions of the seventh
nerve.  Cranial nerves IX, X, and XII likewise were normal.
The tongue was midline.  The gag reflex was intact and she
could phonate clearly.  Cranial nerve [**Doctor First Name 81**] was normal with
intact shoulder shrug.  The upper extremity proximal and
distal strength was 4+ bilaterally.  The lower extremity was
3+ bilaterally in the proximal and distal groups.  The
plantar reflex was flexor.

The remainder of the hospital course was marked by resolution
of her gross edema, daily diuresis was approximately 1 liter
per day.  She initially required approximately 40 mg of
furosemide twice daily.  This was decreased to 40 mg once
daily.  As stated above, the patient required intermittent
potassium repletion.  Phosphate repletion was required every
day.

While the patient's edema appeared to be resolving, the left
upper extremity appeared to be slightly more swollen than the
remaining three limbs.  Given that a left subclavian line was
in place, there was a concern that she may have developed a
deep venous thrombosis.  Noninvasive vascular ultrasound of
that limb did not reveal deep venous thrombosis.  The line
was left in place until peripheral access could be
established in the right upper extremity.

The patient's steroids were tapered as listed in the
medication list below.  Her blood pressure remained above 100
systolic.  She did not require further fluid boluses.

The patient underwent aggressive chest physical therapy with
daily suctioning.  Her oxygen saturations remained above 95%
on approximately 2-4 liters by nasal cannula.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to an acute nursing
facility.

1.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
