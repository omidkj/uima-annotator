Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 76-yo woman w/ MMP incl DM2, Afib, ESRD on HD, CAD
s/p MI / CABG, CHF, sarcoidosis, COPD, p/w hypotension on the
way to dialysis. She was on her way from home at her long term
care facility to HD, when the ambulance noted that her SBP was
70s, so she was taken straight to the nearest ED instead. There
she also was hypoxic to the 60s. She was started on peripheral
Levophed and a facemask, given a dose of Vancomycin, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. On arrival here, her SBP dropped from
110 to 52, so she was started on Neosynephrine in addition to
the Levophed, and these were run in to her HD line due to the
inability to gain adequate other CVL access. She also became
more hypoxic, requiring a NRB. She was noted to have a waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. CT Head was unremarkable, but CT Torso
showed significant findings c/w pneumonia, sarcoidosis vs.
malignancy, and pulmonary congestion. She was given CTX and
Levo. Her VS - afebrile, BP 125/29, HR 80, R 22, O2-sat 97% NRB.
Her DNR/DNI status was confirmed. She was admitted to the MICU.


On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared quite distressed,
and remained hypoxic at 85% on 100% NRB + 6L O2 NC. Her SBPs
were holding in the 120s. She was in severe respiratory
distress, so she was given 0.5mg Morphine IV, with reasonable
effect. The family was notified, and DNR/DNI was confirmed. The
possibility of BiPAP was raised, which the family declined. The
family decided to come in for further discussion regarding her
care and anticipation of moving towards Comfort Measures.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 76-F w/ MMP incl DM2, Afib, ESRD on HD, CAD
s/p MI / CABG, NSF, CHF, sarcoidosis, COPD, p/w hypotension and
hypoxia.
.
#. Hypotension:  The etiology of her hypotension is unclear, the
differential includes sepsis vs. cardiogenic vs. combined. Pt
arrived on 2 pressors with SBPs in 120s through HD line. Now
broadly covered with Vanc / CTX / Levo, although adequate
coverage would include Vanc / Zosyn. Other possibility is severe
congestive heart failure, but pt is anuric and unable to benefit
from HD at this time given her inability to sustain BPs. Family
was aware of situation and preferred to continue pt on multiple
pressors until all family was able to visit prior to
transitioning to Comfort Measures.
.
#. Hypoxia: Also of unclear etiology, DDx includes pneumonia,
aspiration, congestive heart failure, and massive burden of
sarcoidosis vs. recurrent metastatic cancer. Pt appears in
severe respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation of 85% on
100% NRB + 6L NC. Patient's code status was DNR/DNI, which was
confirmed with family. Family also declined BiPAP, which would
have been a temporizing measure for at least the overlying fluid
congestion. Family was aware as above, preferred continuing
current treatment with O2 until all family was able to visit
prior to transitioning to Comfort Measures. see below
.
#. Goals of Care: Pt and family were aware of situation re: pt's
hypotension and hypoxia. Initially, pt was continued on
admitting treatment of antibiotics and pressors without
escalation.  Family came in to see pt today, and after a family
meeting, the decision was made to transition to comfort focused
care.  At this point, antibiotics and pressors were
discontinued, and morphine was used for comfort for respiratory
distress.   Over several hours, the patient gradually became
increasingly hypotensive and bradycardic, and developed agonal
respirations.  At 19:46 on [**2150-9-17**], the patient died.  The
family requested a postmortem exam, and  the paperwork for the
death and postmortem was completed.
