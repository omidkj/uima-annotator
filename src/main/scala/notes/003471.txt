Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the
body of the LA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) Cannot
exclude LAA thrombus.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal
aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity
is depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot
be excluded. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
complex atheromas seen in the thoracic descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr..[**Doctor Last Name **] was notified in person of the results on Mrs. [**Known lastname 303**]
before surgical incision.

POST-BYPASS:
Normal RV systolic function.
LVEF 50%. No regional wall motion abnormalities.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Minimal MR.
The aortic b ioprosthesis is intact and functioning well.
Residual mean gradient is 12 mm of Hg.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN, DM, chronic Afib-on
Coumadin, asthma, and aortic stenosis who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her critical aortic stenosis.
She underwent preoperative testing which included cardiac
catheterization. This was complicated by postprocedure
pseudoanuerysm that was corrected with thrombin injection by IR.
In addition, a right apical neural sheath tumor was found
