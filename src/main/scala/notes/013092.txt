History of Present Illness:
HPI: 63F [**Hospital 100**] rehab resident with chronic hypoxia, secondary
to IRF and OSA, diabetes, charcot foot s/p recent hardware
removal and wound debridement presents to ED from [**Hospital **] rehab
for concern about hypoxia, confusion and left leg wound.  It is
reported that she had a random oxygen saturation of 64% which
recovered to 93% on 6L. I discussed baseline with nursing staff
at HRC.  Patient's baseline is 70-85% on 2-4L NC.  Patient is
frequently non-compliant with her oxygen and bipap at the rehab.
 Nursing staff reports that they have to constantly ask her to
wear her oxygen.  Patient is semi-ambulatory at baseline. Her
recent history is significnat for a hardware removal and wound
debridement on [**2125-2-1**].  She was seen on [**2-15**] and continued on
cipro/clind and LENI was negative for clot.  She was again seen
by her podiatrist on [**2-26**] and he noted that she likely needed
daptomycin for treatment of her wound (MRSA), but was not
started on this because she was not seen by her PCP.

In the ED patient's VS were 97.1 86  126/82  86% 4L improved to
93% on NRB.  Pt had CTPA negative for PE.

ROS: + nasal congestion and cough productive of yellow sputum,
also with urinary incontinence.  Denies fevers, chills,
headache, sore throat, heartburn, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
blood or mucous in stools.

Chest CT [**2125-2-28**]
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Large main pulmonary artery again seen, suggesting pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
3. Extensive emphysematous changes are again seen, unchanged
from prior study.
4. 9-mm nodular density again seen in the right lung. Followup
imaging in [**2125-7-3**], would document 2 year stability.
5. Unchanged compression fracture of the mid thoracic vertebral
body.
6. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease again seen throughout the
aorta.
.
[**2125-3-1**]
ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The saline contrast study was technically
inadequate to exclude a small PFO. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable
to cooperate.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2121-10-30**], the LV cavity does not appear to be
dilated. The other findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: 63F with IPF, chronically hypoxic who presents
with oxygen sats near baseline.

# Hypoxia: Chest CT without acute process. Patient has
underlying hypoxia thought initially to be secondary to
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and OSA.  Her baseline sats were
70-85% at [**Hospital6 459**].   CT was obtained here.  However
the lung findings were localized to the apices supporting a
picture more consistent with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.
The patient defered bronchoscopy.  She was started on prednisone
60mg.  The patient should remain on 60mg until she sees Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (pulmonology clinic) in 2 weeks.  The patient will
also need a repeat CT at that time.

# Foot wound:  Recently seen by [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who recommended
daptomycin, but it was not started at HRC.  Foot obviously
infected here.  Wound cultures show multidrug resistence,
complicated by patients multiple abx allergies.   The patient
should continue on daptomycin.  A PICC line has been placed.
The daptomycin should be continued for 9 more days. A wound vac
was placed by [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

# UTI: Urine culture grew Proteus.  Patient was started on
ceftriaxone, which should be continued for 2 more days.
