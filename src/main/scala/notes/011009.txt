Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**]
Chief Complaint:
This patient presented with what he described as weakness in his
legs and headaches.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left craniotomy for tumor resection [**2140-3-3**]


History of Present Illness:
This patient presented with what he described as weakness in his
legs and headaches. The MRI scan showed a homogeneously
enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe para medially which
completely occluded the sagittal sinus. There
is very little para focal edema. The tumor has a maximum
diameter of 3.4 cm already. The situation was discussed with him
and clearly primary radiosurgery is inappropriate due to the
size of the tumor. Also wait and see strategy given the size and
the inhomogeneity of the contrast enhancement, which was
suspicious for atypical features was not advisable.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 54345**] for an at least partial resection to obtain histological
diagnosis and provide conditions that make radiosurgery of the
tumor parts and the sinus a possibility.


Past Medical History:
unknown

Social History:
lives with wife

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Exam upon discharge:
The patient was oriented x 3. PERRL, EOMs intact. Face
symmetric, tongue midline. He was moving all 4 extremities
spontaneously and was walking on his own. His sensation was
intact. No pronator drift.


Pertinent Results:
Post-op MRI [**2140-3-4**]:
FINDINGS: Postoperative changes are seen in the area of
partially resected
meningioma in the high left occipital lobe adjacent to the
sagittal sinus.
There are small foci of blood products in the operative bed, and
a tiny amount of left subdural blood. Some residual enhancing
mass remains adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus.

Signal change within the sinus itself is not significantly
changed from prior exam, allowing for technical factors. There
is high signal on T2W images within the portions of the sagittal
sinus inferior to the resection site suggestive of slow flow,
but normal enhancement within these areas on post-contrast
images, and no increased signal on precontrast T1W images to
suggest thrombus.

Ventricular size and configuration is unchanged. There is no
evidence of
acute ischemia. Mildly restricted diffusion signal at the
operative bed is
compatible with postsurgical change. Old infarct in the
brainstem is
unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative change at the site of recently resected
meningioma, with
some residual enhancing tumor, and unchanged signal abnormality
within the
adjacent superior sagittal sinus which may represent tumoral
invasion or
thrombus. CTV or phase-contrast MRV could be performed to
further evaluate
this area if clinically indicated.
2. Findings most consistent with slow flow within the sagittal
sinus inferior to the resection site. No additional evidence of
sinus thrombosis.
3. No evidence of acute infarction.

CT Head [**2140-3-3**]:
FINDINGS: High left parietal meningioma has been resected via
left parietal
craniotomy. Expected postsurgical change is seen in the
resection bed. There is no sign of large intracranial
hemorrhage. Moderate amount of
pneumocephalus is present. There is no sign of mass effect, or
vascular
territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are unchanged in
size and
configuration, allowing for differences in modality.

IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical change status post resection
of left
parietal meningioma. No large intracranial hemorrhage.

Pathology: pending at time of discharge but the frozen section
showed meningioma with atypical features

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent elective craniotomy for tumor resection on
[**2140-3-3**]. The surgery went well. He did require intra-operative
platelets due to some bleeding. He had previously been on
aspirin but discontinued it 10 days before the surgery. The
patient went to the ICU post-operatively. His CT scan showed no
large hemorrhage with expected post-surgical changes in the
operative bed. The MRI showed some residual tumor as well as
some blood in the surgical bed and small amount of SDH.
Neurologically the patient was doing very well. He was
transferred to the floor on [**3-4**]. The patient was evaluated by
PT and was deemed safe to be discharged with his family. He was
ambulating, voiding, and taking in food without difficulty. He
was discharged on [**2140-3-6**].
