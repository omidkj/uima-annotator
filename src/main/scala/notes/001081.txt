SOB

PICC line placed

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 yo M with DMI, HTN, h/o MI, Chronic Kidney Disease
s/p LURT [**9-/2105**] from wife, recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma
of lung Stage 1A T1NO (with left upper lobectomy) who presents
with SOB over the past week and decreased UO. The pt states that
he stopped taking his Lasix 1 week ago due to excessive
urination at that time. He has had progressive SOB now over the
past 3 days, to now feeling SOB even at rest. He admits to
orthopnea, PND, and cough (non-productive). He states that the
swelling in his legs has actually improved over the past 2
weeks.
.
In the ED, the patient's vitals were: BP 130/52 (102-122/31-66)
HR 118 (102-115) RR 26 O2 Sat 100% on NRB. He was noted to be
anemic with a hct of 18 (Baseline 26-30), but was guaiac
negative. BNP was elevated at 7882. He received Lasix 60 mg IV
after 1 unit of PRBC. Cr is elevated at 2.9 (baseline 2-2.5).
Iron studies and hemolysis labs were ordered per renal recs. CXR
was consistent with pulmonary edema.
.
On ROS, pt denies weight changes, chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal pain. He admits to no bowel movement in several days.



Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes x25 years
2. hypertension
3. cholesterolemia
4. myocardial infarction in [**2104**]
5. severe osteoarthritis effecting the hips, shoulders, knees
6. spinal stenosis bothering his back
7. chronic kidney disease s/p living related renal transplant in

[**9-/2105**] with a graft from his wife
8. peripheral vascular disease s/p bilateral lower extremity
revascularizations and bilateral toe amputations.
9. left upper lobectomy for an asymptomatic newly defined left
upper lobe pulmonary nodule seen at the time of revision of
lower extremity bypass graft back in [**2111-9-27**]. Path revealed
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 0/5 lymph nodes positive.
His postoperative course was complicated by urinary retention
and a subsequent readmission with urosepsis. He was staged as T1
N0, stage 1A, without need for further treatment.
10. Diastolic Heart Dysfunction: Echo [**1-3**]: There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2).
11. Klebsiella bacteremia, UTI and sepsis [**2-3**]


Social History:
Smoked cigarettes until [**2083**]. No ETOH. He lives at home.
Retired, but was previously a truck driver.

Significant for lung cancer in the patient's father who
developed this at age 75, but subsequently died of a stroke.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2112-3-21**] EKG: EKG: sinus tachnycardia, nl axis, TWI and 1mm ST
depressions in V5-6, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V2, TWI in lateral and
inferior leads-->all old from [**1-3**]
.
[**2112-3-21**] CXR:  IMPRESSION:
Moderate bilateral pulmonary edema, with more focal
consolidative process involving the right lower lobe, likely
representing areas of alveolar pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic
versus renal etiology is not completely clear; recommend
correlation with clinical history and labs to clarify the
etiology.
.
[**2112-3-22**] Renal transplant ultrasound:  IMPRESSION: Normal renal
transplant ultrasound.
.
[**2112-3-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: A portable upright chest radiograph shows
diffuse alveolar edema, right greater than left, with some
sparing of the left upper lobe. Top normal heart size and mild
central pulmonary vascular congestion. Compared to yesterday's
study, there may be slightly more focal consolidation at the
right base. PICC line placed via the right upper extremity is
seen with the tip at the level of the mid superior vena cava.
.
[**2112-3-23**] CXR: PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison to a day prior reveals
persistent alveolar edema again with some sparing of the left
upper lobe. Heart size and pulmonary vascular congestion appears
unchanged. Although more focal consolidation at the right base
is less evident on today's film, this may simply be due to
patient rotation. Evaluation of the apices are limited by head
positioning. Worsening of small pleural effusions is noted
bilaterally. A right sided PIC catheter is unchanged in
position.
.
[**2112-3-24**] CXR:  Compared to prior studies from [**3-22**] and 28th,
there has been interval improvement in now mild interstitial
pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe consolidation has also
improved. Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. There is
blunting of the posterior CP angles likely small pleural
effusions. Right PICC line tip is in the SVC.
.
[**2112-3-22**] ECHO: LVEF 60% Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-1-27**],
tissue Doppler analysis was included in the current study with
evidence of elevated LV filling pressure.

EGD: Grade 1 esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus

Colonoscopy:
1. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
2. Polyps in the cecum (polypectomy)
3. Polyp in the descending colon (polypectomy)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] is a 72 year old male with DMI, HTN, h/o MI, ESRD
s/p LURT [**9-/2105**] from wife, recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma
of lungs Stage 1A T1NO (with left upper lobectomy) who presented
with SOB most consistent with pulmonary edema.
.
#Shortness of Breath/Hypoxia: The patient had pulmonary edema
likely in the setting of diastolic dysfunction exacerbated by
self-discontinuation of lasix (pt. self d/c'd because he was
"tired of urinating all the time").  Additionally, he was
tachycardic on admission and has known diastolic dysfunction
which likely also played a role.  BNP was 7000 on admission.
Another likely contributor to his dyspnea was his anemia, as
below. There were no signs of PNA clinically, and serial CXR
showed improvement of pulmonary edema.  He was initially
admitted to the ICU and required a NRB to keep his oxygen
saturation greater than 90%. He was placed o
