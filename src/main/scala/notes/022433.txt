Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty Swallowing / Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 yo M with history of metastatic prostate
adenocarcinoma recently discharged on [**7-30**] w/ hospice evaluation
after being admitted for worsening abdominal pain in the setting
of aggressive progression of metastatic disease who now presents
with hypoxia and difficulty swallowing. Brought in by his VNA
after noting the above. States he was feeling well until the day
of admission, without cough, fever, or shortness of breath.
Here, found to have initial O2 sat of 90% on RA and SBP of
104/60 with HR of 104 and T 98.7. However, blood pressures
subsequently decreased to 70s. Though patient is DNR/I,
discussion ensued between treating ED resident and patient
regarding goals of care. Patient still declined aggressive
measures including intubation, shocks, CPR, CVLs or other
invasive treatment. However, he did indicate that he would like
to pursue antibiotics as well as peripheral pressors at this
time. He was subsequently started on peripheral dopamine with
improvement in pressures to the 80s-90s systolic. He was also
started on vanc/cefepime and fluconazole after CXR demonstrated
focal pna and patient was found to have oral candidiasis on
exam. He received a total of 5L of NS.
.
Of note, patient was also found to be in acute renal failure and
hyponatremic. He is also leukopenic, though differential was
pending at the time of MICU transfer.
.
.
On the floor, patient is satting 90% on 3L NC when he initially
arrived, increased to 94% on 3L NC and shovel mask post
nebulizer treatment. Patient unable to speak secondary to sore
mouth, but AAOx3, writing on dry-erase board. Denies any
abdominal pain. States lower extremity edema has been present
and stable since [**Month (only) 547**]. Feels breathing is improving and has no
other complaints or concerns. He reconfirms that he does not
want intubation, lines, shocks or CPR.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

CXR ([**8-2**])  - IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes. Infectious consolidation, particularly at
the left
base, cannot be excluded. Repeat evaluation with improved
inspiration would
be helpful, and following appropriate diuresis if there is
concern clinically
for pulmonary edema.
2. Diffusely increased sclerosis in the skeletal structures,
consistent with
known metastatic prostate cancer.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension/Respiratory Distress - On admission, the patient
met SIRS criteria by leukopenia, respiratory rate, and heart
rate.  It was felt that the most likely source was pulmonary.
The patient was not interested in invasive procedures, such at
intubation or central line insertion.  He was also DNR.  The
patient was interested in temporizing measures such as fluid
resuscitation, antibiotics and peripheral pressors.  The patient
was put on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including
vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and fluconazole.  He was
also put on peripheral dopamine.  The patient received 5L of
fluid in the ED as well.  In the MICU, the patient was
maintained on peripheral dopamine to maintain his blood
pressures.  He could not receive large amounts of fluids for his
hypotension because it was felt that fluid overload was
contributing to his shortness of breath.  The patient's clinical
status continued to worse; and, on [**2121-8-6**], he decided to pursue
comfort measures only.  Peripheral pressors and antibiotics were
stopped, and a morphine drip was started.  He expired on [**2121-8-7**].
.
# Acute Renal Failure - The patient's baseline creatinine was
around 0.8, but his creatinine on admission was 1.8.  The
patient appeared volume depleted on his initial exam and was
hyponatremic and hypotensive.  Therefore, his renal failure was
thought to be secondary to poor renal perfusion.  The patient's
creatinine improved after he got fluids.
.
# Hyponatremia - It was felt that the patient's hyponatremia at
presentation was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.  His sodium
level began to normalize after he got fluids.
.
# Hyperkalemia - It was felt that the patient's hyperkalemia on
presentation was secondary to his acute renal failure.  He did
not have any signs of hyperkalemia on EKG, and he was given
kayexalate in the emergency department.  His potassium level
normalized with kayexalate and fluids.
.
# Leukopenia - The patient presented with a leukpoenia that was
likely due to a combination of his recent chemotherapy and
marrow suppression in the setting of critical illness.  He was
put on neutropenic precautions.
.
# Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma - During his most recent
hospital admission, the patient was evaluated for hospice.  He
also had received palliative chemotherapy on [**2121-7-25**].  On
admission, the patient was continued on his outpatient pain
regimen of oxycontin and dilaudid.
