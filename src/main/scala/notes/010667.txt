Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56 y/o female with adult onset asthma and COPD on chronic
home O2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for status asthmaticus, s/p intubation
[**8-6**] and extubated [**8-8**], now improved after steroids and nebs
tx, transferred to medicine floor for further management.

1. Status asthmaticus: Now appears improved s/p extubation,
satting in mid 90s on 4L NC.  Still has been maintained on
steroid taper since admission [**5-2**] with solumedrol 125 mg IV
TID.  MICU notes have mentioned "will wean steroids",but not
weaned as of yet.  PF per MICU resident checked last night and
was 190, not far off pt's baseline.
- Since pt has arrived so late to floor and already has received
solumedrol dose for today, pt switched to PO steroids [**8-11**] 60 mg
po prednisone (will give 3 week taper)
- Cont with frequent alb/atrovent nebs q4 standing
- Cont with flovent, salmeterol inhalers, [**Month/Year (2) 8895**] per outpt
doses
- Likely CO2 retainer given prev ABG, so will monitor O2 sats
carefully, goal low 90s
- Peak flow 260
- f/u with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 19419**]

2. Leukocytosis: wbc almost doubled, now decreasing, unclear
etiology. Pt has remained afebrile.  Central line pulled in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
and sent for culture, now growth.
- Will also check C diff given hospital stay, previous
Azithromycin use, h/o recent diarrhea.  Pt has now not had any
diarrhea.
- No other focal signs of infection
- Will cx if spikes
- Check CBC with diff [**Doctor First Name **] and follow fever curve
- pt has not been febrile.  No more diarrhea. Therefore,
leukocytosis likely [**1-14**] stress of intubation/extubation and
steroids.

3. DM2: qid FS, RISS and fixed doses, probably will have
decreased insulin requirement with taper of steroids43.
4. HTN: titrate up lisinopril
5. GERD: cont. protonix
6. FEN: DM diet
7. Ppx: sc heparin, bowel regimen
8. Access: PIV
