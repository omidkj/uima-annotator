Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: LBP, buttock pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of left internal jugular triple lumen central catheter
Placement of right radial arterial catheter
Intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
.
HPI: 85 y/o female with a PMH significant for dementia, CHF,
HTN, AF on coumadin, bilateral AKA, presenting with hip and back
pain. The pt is unable to give any history and following history
is obtained over the telephone from her daughter. According to
the daughter, the pt has had decreased po intake for about six
months. Since Friday she did not take anything. The pt is seen
by a visiting nurse 3/wk at home. Over the last weeks she noted
a draining lesion on her left buttock which continued to worsen.
Over the last couple of days the pt was complaining of
excrutiating pain in her buttocks, especially when turned.
.
In the ED the patient received Unasyn after blood cultures were
obtained for presumed osteomyelitis. The patient had been
spiking low grade temps throughout her course. She was being
medically managed for all of her chronic medical issues.
.
On the morning [**2125-3-3**], the patient was noted to be unresponsive
by the care aide. A code blue was called. The patient was found
to be in PEA arrest. She received a total of 2mg of epi and 2mg
of atropine. She reverted back to afib with AVR. The patient was
tranferred to the MICU. Within minutes of arriving to the MICU
the patient was noted again to be in afib. She received a total
of 2mg of epi. She was later in stable V-tach. She received
150mg amio and was started on amio drip. She returned to afib.

Pertinent Results:
.
CXR [**2125-2-26**]: Marked increase in the right-sided pleural effusion
since the prior day. Lesser degree of increase in the left
pleural effusion.
.
Repeat CXR [**2125-2-25**] (s/p aspiration event): Bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left with volume loss in the right
lower lobe and alveolar infiltrates on the right.  The overall
appearance is unchanged compared to the film from earlier the
same day.
.
CXR [**2125-2-25**]:  The left lateral lung is off the film.  There is a
right effusion layering posteriorly that is moderate in size and
increased compared to prior. Given the large size of this
effusion it is difficult to assess for underlying alveolar
infiltrate although this is also likely present.  There is
probably also left pleural effusion.  There is bilateral lower
lobe volume loss. IMPRESSION:  Increased right greater than left
effusions.  Infiltrates superimposed so difficult to assess.
.
CXR [**3-9**]: Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar consolidations, likely representing atelectasis.
Slight interval worsening of mild pulmonary edema.
.
Pelvic MRI [**2125-2-22**]: The study is slightly limited due to
difficulty in positioning patient and absence of contrast
enhanced images.  There is a slight mottled appearance of the
[**Month/Day/Year 500**] marrow, likely due to red marrow replacement.  The T1
signal of the bones appears to be preserved
without evidence of suspicious focal hypointense areas. There is
also no
significant areas of edema within the visualized bones. Two
focal areas of decreased T1 signal in the left ilium are likely
areas of accented red marrow replacement especially if the
patient has no history of malignancy. There is severe atrophy of
all visualized muscles and diffuse muscle edema on the STIR
images, likely due to patient's immobility. A Foley catheter is
seen in the urinary bladder. There are surgical clips within the
right groin from prior vascular procedure. A small soft tissue
and skin defect is seen inferiorly below the tip of the coccyx.
It does not appear to contact the [**Name2 (NI) 500**]. IMPRESSION:  Limited
study, but no evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
EKG [**2125-2-21**]: atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response,
IVCD with left axis deviation, prior anteroseptal MI, ? inferior
MI (old)
.
CXR [**2125-2-20**]: rotated, no infiltrate, no cardiopulmonary process
(my read)
.
Pelvic XR [**2125-2-20**]: Bowel gas pattern appears unremarkable.
Surgical clips noted over the right femoral head, unchanged in
appearance from prior study. Bones again appear demineralized.
Degenerative changes noted within the hips bilaterally. No
definite osseous destruction is identified, however, plain
radiography is not sensitive for evaluation of osteomyelitis.
.
ECHO [**2-17**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

Brief Hospital Course:
.
86 yo F with dementia, h/o CHF, HTN, hypothyroidism, DM II, s/p
CVA, h/o PVD s/p bilateral AKA presenting with decubitus ulcers,
FTT and UTI, developed pulseless electrical activity arrest and
so transferred to the ICU
.
# shock, s/p PEA arrests: The etiology of the PEA is not
entirely clear. It is most likely that the patient became
hypoxic. There was no evidence of trauma, hypothermia,
hyperthermia, hyperkalemia, tension pneumo, tamponade etc.
Cosyntropin stim test showed adequate cortisol response. Treated
with broad spectrum antibiotics for infectious sources including
sacral decubitus, poss pneumonia, and UTI, without chance in
pressor requirement.
.
# ? anoxic brain injury s/p PEA arrests: pt's baseline dementia,
blindess, and HOH makes mental status difficult to eval, but
suspect that PEA arrests on day of MICU transfer caused some
element of anoxic injury.
.
# Respiratory: Patient with history of CHF and volume overload.
CXR also supports this. Patient intubated during code, not clear
if respiratory arrest preceeded PEA or PEA preceeded respiratory
failure.
- Continued with mechanical vent support while on pressors
.
#. ID: Patient was being treated for sacral decub with
antibiotics. In the setting of her clinical picture it is
unclear if she became septic. Also consider possible pneumonia
as etiology of hypoxia.
- Continued vanc/zosyn since Staph aureus in sputum as well as
sacral wound and Pseudomonas in sacral wound.
- iv fluconazole for yeast in urine
.
# Decubitus U
