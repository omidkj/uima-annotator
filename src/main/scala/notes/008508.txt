Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin / Amiodarone

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital 7168**] hospital for ventricular tachycardia and
potential EP study and ablation procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2117-11-19**] EP study for VT ablation
[**2117-11-19**] Pericardiacentesis with drain
[**2117-11-20**] Drain removed


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 32729**] is an 82 yo with h/o CAD s/p large anterior MI at
age 36 with EF 25%; 2 vessel CAGB in [**2104**] (LIMA to LAD; SVG to
OM); s/p SNTEMI [**10/2114**] with stent to native L circ. He had a
pacemaker/defibrillator placed in [**2114**] for primary prevention;
he had an episode of VTach in [**2115**] causing syncope and was begun
on amiodarone (d/c'd) and then procainamide since 4/[**2116**]. This
was recently decreased from 1000mg po tid to 500mg tid.
.
He presented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**11-17**] after 1 day of
intermittent palpitations that kept him awake most of the night
of [**2037-11-14**]. Later that day he reported associated light
headedness/diaphoresis which prompted him to go to the ED. He
denied any chest pain or shortness of breath, LOC associated
with these episodes. At [**Location (un) 14078**] he was found to have 150
episodes of VT. Overnight he evidently had 10 episodes
ventricular tachycardia (asymptomatic) and is transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for EP study and possible ablation.
.
Otherwise Mr. [**Known lastname 32729**] is feeling well. He denies any CP, SOB,
or current lightheadedness. At baseline he can walk the length
of a long corridor without significant SOB. His walking is
limited by orthopedic problems rather than dyspnea. He has been
compliant with all of his medications.

[**11-19**] eccho:
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. LV systolic
function
appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is unusually
small. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There is
severe right ventricular compression, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.

[**11-24**] eccho:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is
moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion measuring ~1.2cm anterior to
the right ventricle and right atrium, and <1cm posterior to the
left ventricle and left atrium. Transmitral Doppler does not
suggest hemodynamic compromise.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-11-23**], the
size of the posterior effusion is slightly smaller.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 82 yo with CAD s/p old IMI, 2 vessel CABG in [**2101**], NSTEMI in
[**2113**] with stent to native L circ, CHF with EF 25-30%, VT s/p ICD
placement presenting with recurrent VT. Briefly, Mr [**Known lastname 32729**]
was admitted w/o evidence of sustained VT on telemetry.  He had
successful ablation of LV scar but this procedure was
complicated by pericardial effusion/tamponade.
.
# Cardiac:
-- Rhythm: Patient had recurrent VT likely [**12-24**] old IMI with
scar. His procainamide dose was increased to 750mg po tid  (goal
proc level 8) with similar metoprolol dose at 50mg toprol XL
daily. He had a successful VT ablation with mapping complicated
by bloody pericardial effusion/tamponade and groin bleed (see
below). His pacemaker was reset to 80 bpm; there has been an
advisory on his specific pacemaker and he was instructed to
place a magnet to it daily to ensure that it is working
correctly.  Mr [**Known lastname 95741**] ablation was complicated by
hemorrhagic effusion causing tamponade requiring pericardial
drain (140cc off).  The drain was pulled and repeat eccho
initially showed some small reaccumulation which was
subsuquently stable with no evidence tamponade.
-- CAD: s/p IMI at age 36, CABG [**2103**] with SVG to OM and LIMA to
LAD, NSTEMI [**2113**] with PTCA to L circ;  He was kept on
metoprolol, losartan, aspirin, and statin
-- Pump: baseline of EF 25-30%; symptomatically NYHA class II.
During hospitalization had several episodes of hypotension, one
resolving with draining of pericardial fluid, one with a NS
bolus of 500cc and dopamine. Thought to be in setting of
tamponade phsyiology and hypovolemia. This resolved quickly and
he has been normotense on home antihypertensive regimen
(metoprolol XL 50, losartan 25) for several days prior to
discharge.
.
# Groin Bleed/Hematoma: Patient had groin bleed/hematoma in
setting of elevtaed INR (coumadin outpt) and instrumentation in
fem art for EP study. Direct pressure and pressure dressing
applied with good effect. Anticoagulation was reversed with FFP,
a small amount of vit K and protamine. He did not require any
pRBC transfusion.  His anticoagulation was discontinued (as
below).
.
# Rigors/Fever: Patient had rigors during groin bleed
Differential includes transfusion reaction from FFP or
bacteremia (transient or otherwise) from lines/lungs. All cx
NGTD; the patient otherwise remained AF the rest of his hospital
course.  he was briefly covered with vancomycin.
.
# CRI: Baseline Cr of 2.1-2.3. Not an acute issue
.
# L arm thrombosis: Discontinued anticoagulation as he has been
anticoagulated for over 6 mos and likely no further indication.

.
# Arthritis: continued prednisone as per outpatient PCP
(although this is not likely an appropriate regimen).  he was
adrenally sufficient.
.
# Prostate CA: outpt managmement, continued home medications of
flomax and detrol.
.
# FEN/GI: Euvolemic on admission; low-salt cardiac diet.  Put
back on outpt lasix dose on discharge.
.
# Mr [**Known lastname 32729**] is discharged with f/u in 2 days with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
