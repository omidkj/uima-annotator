Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 53-year-old African-American
female, with multiple medical problems including refractory
hypertension, coronary artery disease status post AV repair,
and mitral valve repair, who presented to the Emergency
Department on the day of admission complaining of chest pain
and headache.  The patient was in her usual state of health,
notable for approximately one month worsening chronic
headache, when she got into an altercation with her daughter
on the afternoon of admission.  During the fight, the patient
apparently complained of chest pain, worsening headaches, and
speaking incomprehensibly to daughter who brought her to the
Emergency Room.  The patient also complained of left arm
numbness.  Further details of complaints not able to be
described by patient secondary to lethargy.

In the Emergency Room, the patient, on arrival, was
hypertensive to 183/75 and complained of worsened headache,
but was apparently chest pain free.  She was treated with 6
mg of IV morphine, multiple doses of metoprolol IV and PO, 25
mg hydralazine, and a dose of labetalol without improvement
in her blood pressure or headache.  She had a head CT that
was negative for acute bleed and was started on nitroprusside
drip and heparin drip for subtherapeutic INR.  Her blood
pressure was marginally improved with Nipride, but she
subsequently developed episodic narrow complex irregular
tachycardia and atrial bigeminy, both of which resolved back
to normal sinus rhythm without further intervention.  EKG on
admission was notable for increased T wave inversions in V1
and V2, unchanged incomplete right bundle branch block.
Subsequent EKG showed bursts of atrial tachycardia to 130-140
and frequent premature atrial contractions, all asymptomatic
and in the context of a K of 2.6.  Given the failure of blood
pressure to correct with nitroprusside, the patient was
admitted to the CCU where labetalol drip was started with
rapid decrease in her blood pressure to 143/66, and
resolution of her headache.

In addition, the patient had had multiple complaints over the
past month notable for fatigue and worsening dyspnea on
exertion.  She also had some tactile fevers and increased
diaphoresis over baseline.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CARDIAC - ISCHEMIA:  The patient
has a history of coronary artery disease with CABG, MI x 2.
Chest pain briefly resolved on arrival to ED and has been
chest pain free.  Enzymes continued to be flat during this
hospitalization stay.  Doubt that active ischemia was
involved with this examination.  Likely due to hypertension
which induced demand ischemia.  The patient was maintained on
aspirin and beta blockade for blood pressure control, and
simvastatin during this examination.  The patient ruled out
for acute MI.  The patient was maintained on labetalol to a
discharge dose of 400 mg tid with good blood pressure control
in-house.

RHYTHM:  The patient had atrial ectopy on admission, likely
atrial tachycardia in the setting of hypokalemia and Nipride.
In addition, the patient had another episode of atrial
tachycardia on hospital day #3 secondary to likely her
missing her labetalol dose in the morning.  Labetalol was
increased to 400 tid for improved beta blockade and rhythm
control.  In addition, the patient was started on amiodarone
with 400 tid x 1 week, to 400 [**Hospital1 **] during next week, and then
400 qd.  The patient had PFTs in-house and her TFTs and LFTs
were performed during this hospitalization stay.

PUMP:  The patient had a history of AI and MR, now without
evidence of CHF.  There was a low suspicion for a vegetation
during this examination, and no further work-up of her
previous valvular disease was done in-house.  The patient was
continued on labetalol, initially on a drip, and then weaned
down to PO labetalol, and had a continued work-up for
hypertension.

HYPERTENSION:  The patient initially presented with
hypertensive urgency and was maintained on a labetalol drip
when placed in the CCU with improvement in her blood
pressures to 130s.  The patient was subsequently transferred
to the floor on hospital day #2 and was maintained on PO
labetalol with good blood pressure control.  After an episode
of atrial tachycardia on hospital day #3, the patient's
labetalol was increased to 400 tid, and was restarted on
amiodarone as described above.

2) FEVER:  The patient was febrile to greater than 101 on
admission, lethargy and sweats.  The patient was
empirically covered on vancomycin and gentamicin on hospital
day #1, and blood cultures were drawn.  The patient was
afebrile for the remainder of her course during the
hospitalization stay, and vanc and gent were DC'd on hospital
day #2.  Blood cultures were no growth to date to the
patient's discharge from the hospital.  There was no concern
for endocarditis at this time, and the patient's mental
status improved with improvement of her blood pressure.

3) MECHANICAL AVR:  The patient with subtherapeutic INR on
admission.  The patient was placed on heparin drip with
warfarin and a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.0.  The patient was
subsequently started on Coumadin, and on the date of
discharge had an INR of 2.5, and will be discharged on 5 qd
of Coumadin.

4) HEADACHE:  Improved with control of blood pressure, likely
related operating table the
