History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old gentleman with a history of cerebral
xanthomatosis (an autosomal recessive disease of lipid storage),
non-verbal at baseline, found at his nursing facility yesterday
with a pool of bright red blood. He subsequently had several
more episodes of bright red blood per rectum at the nursing
facility. There was also concern for blood potentially coming
from his PEG site. He was transferred to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
Initial VS in the ED were BP of 83/67, HR of 88. G-tube was
lavaged with 500cc normal saline with return of dark red blood
not clearing with 750 cc lavage. Dark blood with clots from
g-tube. Rectal exam with maroon liquid, guiaic positive. No
prior history of GI bleed. Felt to be at baseline mental status
answering yes/no questions and giving a lot of thumbs up. He was
seen by GI who noted an empty rectal vault which was guiaic
positive.
.
On arrival to the MICU he appears comfortable and jovial. He is
denying any shortness of breath, light-headedness, or chest
pain.

Cl-104

Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to interventional radiology, where an attempt was
made to find and embolize the vessel leading to the bleeding.
During the course of the procedure he received 27+ units of
packed cells and additional units of FFP, cryoprecipitate and
platelets.  He was found to have extravasation of contrast from
the GDA and a duodenal branch of the SMA.  Both were coiled to
stasis during the procedure and there was no evidence of further
extravasation.  The L gastric artery was also embolized with
gelfoam.  He was taken to the MICU afterwards.  While in the
MICU, he again became hypertensive and continued to have blood
come out of his PEG tube and his flexi-seal tube.  He was taken
emergently to the operating room.  While in the operating room,
he received an additional unit of packed red cells, but was
found to have an intra-operative hematocrit around thirty, so no
more units were given.  During the course of the exploratory
laparotomy, he was found to have a bleeding duodenal ulcer which
was oversewn.  There were no other sources of bleeding
identified and he was closed primarily and taken to the surgical
ICU.

His post-operative [**Last Name (un) 10128**] was uncomplicated initially.  His
hematocrit was stable, he passed some small amounts of melanotic
stool post-operatively, but these resolved by POD 1.  His trauma
line was discontinued on POD 1 as his hematocrit had been
stable, and he was transferred out of the SICU on POD 2.  His
tube feeds through his g-tube were restarted on POD 3 early in
the AM.  At some point around 7-8am on POD 3 ([**2119-10-9**]), he had a
large amount of emesis which appeared very similar to tube feed
material.  He had immidiate respiratory distress and was
coughing copiously.  He was transferred back to the SICU and he
was re-intubated.  He had a bronchoscopy which showed a small
amounts of fluid in the lungs and erythema consistent with
pneumonitis.  He was placed on CMV and began having increasing
FiO2 and PEEP requirements to maintain even modest PaO2 in the
50s.  By POD 4, he was requiring FiO2 of 100% and high PEEP
settings up to 20cmH2o, and he was also started on inhaled
nitric oxide to attempt to improve his oxygenation.  As POD 4
went on, he continued to have very poor PaO2 and was also
requiring increasing levels of vasopressors to maintain his
systolic pressures adequately.  His lactate, which had been 1.8
on [**2119-10-9**] and 5.7 a few hours after the aspiration, had now
climbed to 11.3, and the decision was made to place the patient
on ECMO to attempt to improve his oxygenation.  He continued to
have PaO2 in the 50s and 40s and was eventually maxed out on
norepinepherine, vasopression and neosynepherine.  His lactate
rose to 23.3 and he began to have episodes of ventricular
fibrillation.  A code was called during his first episode of
ventricular fibrillation but was shortly cancelled after two
rounds of epinepherine, bicarbonate and shocks did nothing to
alter his heart rhythm.  Compressions were not started as the
patient was already on ECMO at the time of the code.  At roughly
1145pm on [**2119-10-10**], the decision was made to make the patient
comfort measures only and he expired shortly thereafter at 0035
[**2119-10-11**].
