HIV ab - negative.

EKG: sinus tach, rate 115, LVH and LAE. normal axis and
intervals. horizontal 1.5mm STE in V1 and 1-2mm STE in V2-V3
that are upsloping and appear to be possible J point elevation.
STD in V5 and V6. No Q waves, normal RWP.

CXR ([**12-1**]): There is a somewhat ill-defined, hazy airspace
opacity in the left mid-lung zone, partially obscuring the left
cardiac silhouette, suggesting consolidation in the lingula. The
right lung and left upper lung are clear, without other foci of
consolidation or pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The
heart is not enlarged, and there is no hilar or mediastinal
enlargement. Pulmonary vascular structures are normal. Soft
tissue and bony structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with lingular pneumonia.

TTE ([**12-1**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous
and elongated. There is severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet
with associated, posteriorly-directed jet of moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Myxomatous mitral valve disease with at least
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Dilated left ventricle
with preserved global biventricular systolic function.

CXR ([**12-2**]): Since the previous study, there has been
development of consolidation at left base. This is likely due to
a combination of pleural effusion as well as focal infiltrate
from pneumonia. Followup to resolution is recommended. There are
no signs of overt pulmonary edema.

TEE ([**12-2**]):

The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricle is normal in size, with normal
free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis. Myxomatous mitral valve
disease with bileaflet prolapse and moderate to severe
regurgitation.

CXR [**2142-12-4**] - Marked interval improvement in left pleural
effusion, now tiny. Persistent lingular opacity. Followup chest
x-ray to resolution.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo male with a history of MVP who presented with cough and L
sided chest pain found to have PNA as well as chronic sever MR.

# Severe MR: The patient has a history of mitral valve proplase
and was seen to have severe MR on a TTE with an elarged left
atrium suggesting that this is a chronic process.  Myxomatous
mitral valve leaflets were seen with Moderate/severe MVP. No
mass or vegetation was seen on the mitral valve. His had
preserved systolic function w/ LVEF > 55%.  Due to concern
initally for endocarditis given his presentation with fevers and
chills he was intially treated with vanc and gent, but given no
vegetations on TEE, these were discontinued on HD2.  TEE also
showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 13385**], myxomatous MV, moderate MVP w/ severe MR
w/ eccentric jet.  Blood cultures were negative at time of
discharge.  Given his tachycardia and elevated SBP's he was
treated with nitroprusside for afterload reduction as well as
lasix for diuresis.  By HD2, he was weaned off nitroprusside and
started on captopril titrated up to 25mg TID, w/ SBPs 110 - 139.
At time of discharge BP was 123/79 and he was transitioned to
Lisinopril 20mg QD.  Pt was also discharged on 20mg Lasix daily
for the week prior to surgery.

Cardiac surgery evaluated the patient for MVR.  The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed 40% mid LAD and
D1 stenoses, non-flow limiting and clean RCA and LCX.

# Coronaries.  See above for cath report results.  Pt. was not
started on ASA for primary prevention due to likely surgery
within next week.  His Lipid panel was checked and was pending
at time of discharge.  This will be follow up as OP by his
cardiologist.  He was not started on a statin, this will also be
assessed on outpatient basis after MVR.
.
# Pneumonia:  The patient presented with cough, pleuritic chest
pain, and intermittent fevers and was seen to have a lingular
infiltrate on CXR.  He then developed a left-sided pleural
effusion the day after admission.  He was initally given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED.  Antibiotics were
switched to levofloxacin for a 5 day course at 750 mg daily to
treat a community-aquired PNA. On HD4, CXR showed much improved
L pleural effusion (likely improved from diuresis) and slightly
improved L lingular infiltrate.  At time of discharge, patient
was asymptomatic with oxygen requirement resolved.

# Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry
