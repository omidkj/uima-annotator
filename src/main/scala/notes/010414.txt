Pertinent Results:
[**2129-5-9**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. No findings of bowel obstruction. Small-to-moderate sized
fluid
collection within the subcutaneous tissues and peritoneal cavity
along the
lateral right abdominal wall/flank. This appears predominantly
simple by
Hounsfield unit attenuation and contains internal locules of
gas, presumably related to the recent surgery. There is
incomplete rim enhancement and underlying superinfection not
excluded. If there remains a high clinical concern for
infection, collection should be amenable to percutaneous
aspiration.
2. Moderate atherosclerotic disease and marked mitral annular
calcification.
3. Moderate right and small left pleural effusion. Trace
pericardial
effusion. Mild amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
4. High-density material within the gallbladder may reflect
vicarious
excretion of previously administered intravenous contrast or
biliary sludge.  The gallbladder is moderately distended, likely
related to n.p.o. status.  However, if there remains a high
clinical concern for acalculous
cholecystitis, suggest correlation with HIDA examination.
5. Significant bladder distention at time of examination. Please
correlate
for any clinical symptoms of urinary retention. Small amount of
gas within
the bladder likely reflects recent instrumentation/Foley
catheter.
6. Slight asymmetrical positioning of the femoral head within
the acetabular component of the right hip arthroplasty. This may
simply reflect patient positioning, but can be better assessed
with dedicated pelvic radiograph to evaluate for uneven
acetabular wear.
7. Incompletely characterized left adrenal mass. In a patient
without any
history of malignancy, this is almost certainly a benign
adenoma. Current
guidelines do suggest correlation with biochemistry to assess
for a functional adenoma and repeat imaging in 12 months to
exclude growth if there are no prior imaging is available to
document stability.

  [**2129-5-9**] CT guided drainage of abdominal abscess :
Technically successful CT-guided aspiration and drainage of a
right lateral abdominal collection yielding clear dark brownish
red fluid
suggestive of subacute to chronic hematoma/seroma. 6 French
catheter left to
bag and gravity drainage. Specimen sent to microbiology for
further analysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room and admitted to the SICU for further management.
She was intubated and sedated and required voluminous fluid
resuscitation to correct her acidosis. Her renal function
gradually improved and over a 24 hour period she was weaned and
extubated from the respirator.  Her WBC on admission was 32K but
that gradually decreased and she remained afebrile. Her
hematocrit drifted to 21 and following two units of packed red
blood cells she stabilized.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she began to progress.
She was gradually tolerating a regular diet but unfortunately
failed two voiding trials requiring replacement of the Foley
catheter.  Her abdominal wound was healing well.  She was
evaluated by the Physical Therapy service who recommended a
short term rehab prior to returning home to help increase her
mobility and stamina.

Of note, she remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation and
her Coumadin was not resumed due to her prior bleeding.  Her PCP
can decide after she's fully recovered if she should resume it.
She did have 1 episode of chest pain during her admission with
negative enzymes and no ischemic changes on her EKG.  This
happened just prior her developing an abdominal wound
collection.

On [**2129-5-9**] her WBC started to rise again and she had increased
abdominal pain. An abdominal CT was done which noted a fluid
collection along the right flank and subsequently she underwent
percutaneous drain placement which resolved her pain.  She was
also placed on Cipro and Flagyl.  Her diet was resumed and she
was feeling much better. Her drain is putting out about 50 cc of
dark bloody fluid daily and her hematocrit is stable at 31. Her
creatinine is now down to her baseline of 0.5. The preliminary
cultures on the abdominal fluid are negative.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] will be discharged to rehab on [**2129-5-11**] and will
follow up in the [**Hospital 2536**] Clinic next week.
