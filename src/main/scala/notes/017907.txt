History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4154**] is a 71 year old man with PMH significant for ESRD on
HD and endocarditis who was admitted to [**Hospital3 105**] on
[**2132-9-12**] with respiratory failure and endocarditis following a
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] for MRSA septic shock. He had been
recovering there until day of arrival, when he was found to have
a fever of 101.0. He was found to be growing VRE and was started
on linezolid on day of admission. It is not clear if this was
from a surveillance culture or if he had been spiking fevers
prior to day of arrival. While at [**Hospital1 **], vanco had been dosed
by level throughout his course, with the last level 30 on [**10-28**].
Of note, he was dialyzed today through the tunnelled catheter
that was placed in his groin in [**10-9**] by IR. At
baseline, the patient is oriented x [**11-24**] with periods of
confusion. He was transferred to this facility for change of HD
access.

CT head [**10-29**]: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. Evidence
of chronic ischemia and right maxillary sinus and bilateral
mastoid opacification, unchanged since [**2132-6-11**].

CXR [**10-29**]: Bilateral multifocal pneumonia, and/or a moderate
degree of congestive failure.

ECHO [**10-31**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal. There is an echogenic density in the right
ventricle
consistent with a pacemaker lead.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses
or vegetations  are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is  seen on the mitral valve. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within  normal limits).
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2132-9-1**], no change.
IMPRESSION:
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.

PICC placement [**11-7**]:
1. Successful placement of a 21 cm, single lumen [**Last Name (un) **]
midline catheter with tip in the left subclavian vein, ready for
use.
2. Venogram demonstrates stenosis at the junction of the left
subclavian and brachiocephalic veins.

TEE [**11-7**]: Conclusions:
Despite multiple attempts, the TEE probe could not be passed
into the
esophagus. At baseline, the patient was hypotensive, on
vasopressors, with difficult intravenous access, therefore
deeper sedation was deemed unsafe from the hemodynamic
standpoint. TEE was therefore aborted.

CXR [**11-14**]: No significant interval change in the appearance of
the right mid lung infiltrate, pulmonary vascular congestion,
and pleural effusion since the prior study.

CXR [**11-18**]: Increased pulmonary edema compared to [**2132-11-18**] with
unchanged probable multifocal pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 71yo man with ESRD on HD< CAD s/p PCI, paroxysmal
afib s/p PPM, ?HIT, recurrent line bacteremia,
ventilator-dependent since [**5-27**], admitted with VRE line
bacteremia and pseudomonas multifocal pneumonia, progressively
deteriorated without alternative options for treatment, until
goals of care were made to be comfort measures only.

Hospital course is discussed below by problem:

1. Line sepsis: He was found to have VRE from his hemodialysis
catheter. This was removed and replaced twice. In addition, he
was treated with many antibiotics, including (at the end of his
hospitalization) daptomycin, colistin, metronidazole, and
ambisome. His lines continued to be infected. The idea of
treating him with an "antibiotic lock" using ambisome,
daptomycin, and argatroban in a heplock was considered, but no
studies of safety and efficacy had been done investigating this
method. The ID team was following his care closely throughout
the hospitalization.

2. Hypotension: The patient was found to be recurrently
hypotensive. This was most likely secondary to sepsis, as he had
both a line infection and a pneumonia that could not be treated
effectively. In addition, he became hypotensive with increases
in PEEP and with hemodialysis. He was initially treated with
small fluid boluses, changes in ventilator settings, and
adjustments to hemodialysis, but eventually had to be placed on
levophed. This medication, however, was not enough to maintain
his blood pressure, and it was discontinued when the patient was
made CMO. He did not have any available access to start another
pressor.

3. Respiratory failure: This was thought to be secondary to
either septic emboli from his line, pneumonia, or ARDS (from
sepsis or volume overload). Volume overload was considered less
likely as his respiratory status worsened after being dialyzed.
