Imaging:

CTA perfusion: [**10-3**]

IMPRESSION:
1. Findings indicative of dense left middle cerebral artery.
Extensive small
vessel disease identified with brain atrophy and chronic right
periatrial watershed infarct.
2. CT perfusion demonstrates a large area of increased mean
transit time in
the left MCA distribution with patchy small areas of low blood
volume
indicative of ischemia with areas of infarction.
3. No occlusion or hemodynamically significant stenosis in the
arteries of
the neck.
4. Findings indicative of occlusion at the bifurcation of left
middle
cerebral artery with diminished number of sylvian branches
distally.

CT head [**10-4**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of hypodensity in the left
frontoparietal region
compatible with evolution of known large region of ischemia and
infarction in the left MCA territory (as demonstrated on
yesterday's CT- perfusion study).

2. No significant associated mass effect or herniation, and no
hemorrhage.

3. Encephalomalacia involving the right parietal lobe compatible
with chronic infarction in a watershed distribution.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 95318**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman who has atrial fibrillation
but was not anticoagulated due to concerns about prior falls, hx
of prior strokes and MCI who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Neurology
service with a left MCA territory stroke. On initial
presentation, she had a global aphasia with dense right
hemiplegia.

CTA showed a dense left middle cerebral artery stroke with
extensive small
vessel disease and a chronic right periatrial watershed infarct.
 No occlusion was noted in the neck arteries.  This event was
felt to be cardioembolic in origin. Given no contraindications
therfore IV-thrombolytics were administered at 1820 on [**10-3**].
There was delay in obtaining initial imaging as patient became
ill in CT scanner with vomiting.  She was admitted to ICU for
post tpa management.  Her blood pressure was allowed to
autoregulate, IVF were adminstered to maintain CPP.

Modifiable risk factors were A1C of 6.0 and LDL of 97.  Statin
was incrased to 40mg daily.  Her heart rate remained in 60-80s
[**Hospital 95320**] hospital stay and should this increase, a metoprolol
formulation may be used to control the heart rate, goal 60-70s.


She remained neurologically stable and her CT head follow up
showed expected evolution of her stroke.  She was started on
heparin gtt (goal 60-80) and bridged with coumadin.  Her INR
goal is [**1-7**]. She will require HCT monitoring and guiac of her
stools.

Due to intermittent agitation, she was given haldol IV 1mg,
which lead to significant somnolence, resolved by HD3.  Seroquel
may be used cautiously in its place.

At time of discharge, her examination improved to the point of
able to follow 2 step commands and improved comprehension.  She
was unable to repeat, name or read.  Expressive aphasia full of
neologisms with occasional accurate word. Please see discharge
exam for details.

She will require physical and occupational therapy.  She did not
have a swallowing deficit, however PO intake has been poor over
past 24 hours.  She was able to take PO medications in pudding.


Follow up with neurology was arranged.  She will also require
arrangement of follow up with PCP.

Code status: DNR/I.
