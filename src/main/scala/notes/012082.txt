HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
white male with a history of coronary artery disease with
three-vessel disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal
failure with recent acute renal failure admitted to outside
hospital on [**2166-5-29**] with hypoxia.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management
of respiratory failure.  In the early even of [**2166-5-29**] at
rehabilitation the patient complained of shortness of breath.
Oxygen saturations decreased to the 60s.  He was sent to an
outside hospital where he reportedly became unresponsive with
oxygen saturations of 80% on 100% face mask.  He was
intubated and sent to the intensive care unit.  He was
treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin and
started on vancomycin for one out of two blood cultures
positive for "staph".  No further isolation was noted.  White
blood cell count was 15.9.  There was no documented fever.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV b.i.d. with a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of approximately 15.  He
was placed on a dopamine drip for hypotension with systolic
pressures in the 70s.  On the morning of transfer the patient
was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 160s to
170s.  He was started on a diltiazem drip in addition to the
dopamine pressor for rate control as well as a heparin drip.
The wife requested transfer to [**Hospital1 188**] where he was recently hospitalized [**2166-4-7**] through
[**2166-4-19**] for left hip fracture, non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction, stent to the right coronary artery, acute renal
failure secondary to contrast dye requiring dialysis x 2, and
repair of hip fracture with a left open reduction and
internal fixation.  Upon transfer he was on SIMV
16-[**Medical Record Number 22113**], heparin drip, dopamine drip, diltiazem drip and
insulin drip.  Of note, in addition to his respiratory
failure he was in diabetic ketoacidosis with a metabolic
acidosis.  He had blood loss anemia with an hematocrit of 19
and he was in shock with a picture most consistent with
sepsis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery disease status post
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction on [**2166-4-7**],
catheterization on [**2166-4-9**] with three-vessel disease, stent
right coronary artery.  2. Hypertension.  3.
Hypercholesterolemia.  4. Congestive heart failure with an
ejection fraction of approximately 25%.  5. Chronic renal
failure with acute renal failure [**4-10**] secondary to
catheterization dye load requiring hemodialysis x 2 sessions.
6. Anemia with decreased hematocrit to 20 with prior
hospitalization, source unknown.  7. Status post left open
reduction and internal fixation [**2166-4-15**].  8. Status post a
right THA.  9. Status post transurethral resection of the
prostate.  10. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  11. History
of a seizure disorder, questionably four years ago.  12.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 103 axillary, blood
pressure 90s/50s to 70s/30s, heart rate 100, vent AC at
600-6, FIO2 35%.  In general he was responsive to touch,
moved eyes to voice command.  HEENT showed pinpoint pupils.
Kyphoscoliosis.  Mucous membranes were dry.  heart was
regular rate and rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur at the
left sternal border.  Lungs had breath sounds somewhat
coarse, clear with suctioning.  Mild basilar crackles.
Abdomen soft, nontender, no stool in the vault.  Foley
catheter had yellow clear urine.  Extremities were warm and
well perfused.  Upper extremity edema was noted on hands.  No
lower extremity edema.  The patient had a right brachial line
with Swan in place, left radial arterial line, no stranding
erythema.  On neurological examination he moved all
extremities.  He had pinpoint pupils noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 1.1, hematocrit 23.4,
decreased from 27.4 on [**2166-6-1**].  Platelet count was 100.
Neutrophils 83.8, eosinophils 2, basos none.  Sodium was 127,
potassium 5.2 hemolyzed, chloride 95, bicarbonate 18, BUN 60,
creatinine 2.5, baseline 1.8, glucose 298, calcium 7.7,

114, 21.

Chest x-ray showed a Swan-Ganz catheter tip seen in the right
main pulmonary artery.  ETT 2 cm above the carina.  He had
improved pulmonary edema, no acute cardiopulmonary process
noted.

Echocardiogram from [**4-10**] showed left ventricular ejection
fraction of 25%, AK anterior septum, anterior free wall,
apex, moderate HK inferior septum and lateral free wall.
There was 1+ mitral regurgitation, trace aortic
regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

Catheterization on [**2166-4-9**] showed three-vessel disease with
left anterior descending coronary artery 70% proximal lesion,
100% mid with collaterals from PDA.  LCX 60% lesion, RCA 80%
x 2 with stent x 2 with good flow.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, rate 105, prolonged PR, left
axis, poor R wave progression, less than [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression
noted in the inferior leads.  AVL with Q waves, T wave
inversion, new when compared to the EKG from [**2166-4-17**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Respiratory failure:  The patient was
admitted to an outside hospital with acute hypoxia, etiology
unknown, although aspiration pneumonia presumed, question
also of PE given recent surgery, question also of pulmonary
edema given history of severe congestive heart failure.  The
patient required ventilatory support for several days.
Initial wean was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and
agitation requiring reintubation.  At this time code status
was discussed at length with the wife.  She decided on DNI
after next extubation.  The patient was successfully
extubated on [**2166-6-10**] on a nitroglycerin drip and Lasix drip
with a bolus.  His respiratory status continued to improve
throughout the rest of his hospital stay.  At the time of
discharge he was consistently saturating 98-100% on a
two-liter nasal cannula and required minimal suctioning.

2. Shock:  On admission the patient had a blood
pressure of 70s/30s with a temperature of 103 consistent with
septic shock.  His brachial and Swan line were removed and
replaced with a subclavian line.  He was weaned off of his
diltiazem and dopamine drip with the initiation of Levophed.
After initiation of antibiotics as well as volume repletion
with blood products, he was weaned successfully off of his
Levophed.  Mild hypotension persisted until the patient was
extubated.  Since this time he has remained normotensive.

3. Congestive heart failure:  The patient had an ejection
fraction of 25% consistent per repeat echocardiogram done.
He received p.r.n. Lasix boluses and required a Lasix drip at
the time of extubation and given flash pulmonary edema.  He
was started on
