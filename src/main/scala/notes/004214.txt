Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure, altered mental status
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Massive PE, intubated on pressors


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ACLS for pulselessness

History of Present Illness:
63 year old female with h/o HIV on HAART (CD4 1049) and recent
L5-S1 fusion 3 weeks ago who presents with hypotension and
seizures.
.
She was admitted [**2152-7-17**] to [**2152-7-21**] for L5-S1 fusion that was
uncomplicated.  She was not discharged on DVT prophylaxis given
the surgery.  She was at rehab until about 1 week ago.  This
morning, she complained of palpitations as well as leg pain
which was new.  Then her physical therapist noted a low BP
(unclear [**Location (un) 1131**]) and felt that she may be dehydrated.  She also
complained of chest pain.  Later, her VNA noted low BP as well.
Her daughter then witnessed a tonic-clonic seizure where the
patient fell back on the bed and her eyes rolled back in her
head and her extremities were shaking.  She has never had
seizures prior.  EMS was called.  BP on arrival by EMS was
60/palp which improved to 74/palp after 500cc IVF.

In the ED, she was hypotensive and initially given aspirin and
morphine.  CTA showed massive saddle PE.  She was hypotensive
with SBP in the 30's and was intubated and started on peripheral
levophed.  Also given 6L fluid.  TPA was then initiated at 21:39
(100mg IV over 20 minutes).  Sedated with versed and fentanyl.
Phenylephrine was started when she maxed out on levophed.  SBP
decreased to the 50's and she lost a pulse and chest
compressions were started, 1mg epi given, pulse returned after 1
minute.  Cardiology was consulted but declined to take her to
the cath lab.  Her BP's began to improve and SBP was 170's and
pressors were weaned.  Currently SBP in the 90's on
neosynephrine only, HR 90's (previously 140-150).  Thoracic
surgery also aware and discussing patient's case.  She then
received 5000unit heparin bolus plus started on heparin drip at
1000 units/hr.

IMAGING:
CTA:
FINDINGS:
There is adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree.
The main
pulmonary artery is enlarged, measuring up to 3.0 cm, and there
are extensive pulmonary emboli, including a large saddle embolus
and additional emboli extending into both the right and left
main pulmonary arteries and peripheral pulmonary arterial tree.
There is no associated pulmonary infarct. However, there is
evidence of right heart strain, including dilation of the right
atrium and right ventricle, leftwardbowing of the
interventricular septum, and reflux of contrast into the IVC and
hepatic veins. The aorta is normal. There is no evidence of
acute aortic syndrome. There is no mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion or pleural
effusion.  There is atelectasis medially at the right lung base.
There is no evidence of pneumonia. There is no pulmonary nodule
or mass identified.  In the included upper abdomen, there is a
single hypodensity within the left lobe of the liver, too small
to characterize, though likely a cyst. There is no acute
intra-abdominal process identified.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions
identified
concerning for malignancy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Massive saddle pulmonary emboli, extending into both the
right and left
main pulmonary arteries and all aspects of the pulmonary
arterial tree.
2. Evidence of right heart strain, including dilation of the
right atrium and right ventricle and bowing of the
interventricular septum. Prominent main PA suggest associated
pulmonary hypertension.
3. Minor right basilar atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary
infarct.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic
dysfunction. Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation. At least
moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small, hypertrophied left
ventricle with preserved global and regional systolic function.

.
CXR: FINDINGS: Right lower lung atelectasis and minimal right
pleural effusion are no different from prior radiograph dated
[**2152-8-13**]. Mild vascular engorgement is similar to the
prior radiograph. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal
and hilar contours are unchanged. No new lung opacities of
concern. Left PICC line terminates at upper SVC.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2152-8-13**], the right minimal pleural
effusion and lower lung atelectasis are unchanged.
