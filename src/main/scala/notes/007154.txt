Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy on [**2150-12-2**]


History of Present Illness:
85 year old female with a-fib, HTN, HL, hypothyroidism p/w
abdominal pain and vomiting of 2 day duration. Patient reports
diffuse [**9-6**] abdominal pain for the past 2 days. Describes
associated nausea and non-bloody vomiting. Patient describes
associated fevers and one episode of diarrhea. Patient currently
lives in a nursing home and is unsure if others have been sick.
She has a long-standing history of abdominal pain (see below)
but typically is not associated with nausea or vomiting.

Patient has had multiple admissions for abdominal pain over the
past four years with a negative work-up to date. Work-up has
included multiple CT scans including CTA, surgical/[**Month/Year (2) 1106**]/GI
consults and admissions. Most recent note from GI stated felt to
be related to constipation and chronic abdominal pain syndrome.
Felt unlikely to be mesenteric ischemia as does not occur after
meals and no weight loss. Her most recent admission with similar
complaints was on [**2150-7-14**], at which time CT scans of her
abdomen and pelvis were negative for ulcers, obstructions, or
lesions. Her pain decreased during her hospital stay with
Tylenol. Her diet was advanced as tolerated and she was able to
tolerate po meals her 1st night in-house onwards. She was also
diagnosed with a UTI for which she was started on Bactrim.

In the ED, initial vitals were 99.5 118 152/90 22 100% 6L NC.
Lactate was found to be 2.2. Temperature spiked to 103.2
rectally. She was given Zofran, morphine 4 mg x 2, Acetaminophen
rectal 650 mg early in the night; later on she was started on
Zosyn, Vancomycin, 1 mg Dilaudid, and 650 mg Tylenol. CT
abd/pelvis showed no significant change from prior. CXR was wnl.
EKG demonstrated A Fib. Patient was persistently tachycardic and
consequently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.

On arrival to the ICU patient reports overall improvement. Her
son who [**Name2 (NI) 97944**] her reports she has mostly been complaining
of abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea and vomiting. The nausea
and vomiting are not typical for her. Patient reports mild
[**Name2 (NI) **]/sneezing today. She denies dysuria, increased urinary
frequency. She reports pain from her "head to her belly" - but
most notable in her abdomen. It is unclear whether she has been
having chest pain and overall is a difficult historian. She
reports overall mild headache, no nucchal rigidity or
significant pain when moving her neck. She reports chronic
muscle aches and shortness of breath. Otherwise ROS negative.

Imaging:
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2150-11-27**] 7:28 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged large paraumbilical hernia containing small bowel
and omental
fat. There is no evidence of obstruction or strangulation.
2. Extensive colonic diverticulosis, with no evidence of
diverticulitis.
3. Severe atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta, main
branches,
unchanged since the prior examination. A patent aortobifemoral
graft is
redemonstrated. Aneurysmal changes in the internal iliac artery
are stable.
There is unchanged near-complete occlusion of the bilateral
superficial
femoral arteries and moderate stenosis of the mid portion of the
internal
iliac arteries.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2150-11-27**] 9:09 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Unchanged
aneurysmal
dilatation and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, previously
evaluated on CTA of the chest from [**2150-3-28**].

MRCP [**2150-11-30**]:
1. Somewhat limited study due to non-breathhold technique.
2. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation with CBD dilated up to 1
cm,
without definite evidence of choledocholithiasis.
3. Dilated atherosclerotic suprarenal abdominal aorta.

ERCP ON [**2150-12-2**]: Biliary Tree: A moderate diffuse dilation was
seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 12 mm. Given
high clinical suspicion and the severe major papilla stenosis, a
sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Some sludge was
removed using a balloon catheter. Occlusion cholangiogram did
not reveal any filling defects. Excellent drainage of bile and
contrast was noted. Impression: A severe stenosis of the major
papilla was noted Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed
with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique A moderate
diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree w
