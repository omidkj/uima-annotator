Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old male
who presented to the outside with the complaint of chest pain
and nausea for approximately twenty-four hours.  On route to
the hospital the patient had an episode of ventricular
fibrillation arrest.  He was shocked three times and returned
to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm and then atrial fibrillation.  The
patient was started on a Lidocaine drip.  The patient was
then transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**],
where a cardiac catheterization was performed.  The patient
was started on Aggrastat.  Intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed and the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Asthma.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Theophylline 200 q.d.
2.  Allopurinol 300 q.d.
3.  Triamterene hydrochlorothiazide.
4.  Accupril 20 q.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg.
6.  Lipitor 10 q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to LATEX.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Heart rate 72, blood pressure 130/86 augmented, respiratory
rate 17, oxygen saturation 97% two liter.  HEENT:  Sclerae
anicteric.  CHEST:  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  CORE:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and
S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  EXTREMITIES:  1+ edema
right groin, intra-aortic balloon pump in place.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Please see the report for full
details.  In summary, LMCA 50% to 60% distal stenosis; LAD
80% stenosis after diagonal 1; left circumflex 50% proximal
stenosis; RCA 90% stenosis.

The patient was evaluated by the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Service.  It was decided to bring the patient to the
operating room on [**2180-1-2**].  The patient had a CABG
times two with a LIMA to the LAD and SVG to obtuse marginal.
Bypass time was 49 minutes.  Two mediastinal tubes and one
pleural tube were placed.  The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was extubated and the
intra-aortic balloon pump was appropriately removed.  By
postoperative day #2, all the drips were weaned.  The patient
had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation and a 2 second
event of asystole.  The episode of asystole was isolated and
did not occur throughout the remainder of the admission.  Due
to minimal output of the chest tube on post pull chest x-ray
revealed no pneumothorax and no consolidation.  The patient
was seen by the Electrophysiology Service on postoperative
day #3.  The patient was started on Amiodarone per their
service.  The patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #3 in stable condition.  By postoperative
day #5, the patient had multiple episodes of ventricular
tachycardia, which were nonsustained.  The patient was also
in and out of atrial fibrillation.  As a result, Coumadin was
started.  Electrophysiology Service wished to study him on
[**1-10**], and as a result Coumadin was held on [**1-7**] and the Heparin drip was started.  On [**1-10**], the
patient was seen by the Electrophysiology Service.  It was
decided at that point that an AICD was not indicated.  The
patient's Amiodarone dose was adjusted to 200 mg q.d.  On
[**1-11**], [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-of-Hearts device was placed.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg q.d. times 7 days.
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq times 7 days.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
5.  Allopurinol 300 mg q.d.
6.  Combivent MDI two puffs q.4h.p.r.n.
7.  Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
8.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
9.  Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
10. Percocet one to two tablets q.4 to 6h.p.r.n.
11. Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
12. Coumadin 5 mg q.d.
13. Heparin drip at 1200 units per hour to be discontinued
when the INR of 2 to 2.5 is obtained.  Until the INR is 2 to
2.5, a PTT should be checked and it should be maintained
between 1680.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to the
rehabilitation facility.  The patient will followup with the
following:  1.  Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks.  2.  Primary
care provider or cardiologist in three weeks.  3.
Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-2**] at 2 p.m.

DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post CABG times two.
2.  Asthma.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on discharge revealed the
following:  white count 9.6, hematocrit 28.6, platelet count
488, INR 1.6, PTT 56.9, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride
101, bicarbonate 26, BUN 23, creatinine 1.4, and glucose 98.
