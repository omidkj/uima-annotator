admission CXR: There is evidence of prior coronary artery bypass
grafting. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The lung
volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**]
engorgements are longstanding. Right pleural thickening vs
loculated fluid and rounded atelectasis in the right lower lobe
is stable. There is new blunting of the left costophrenic angle,
which may be consistent with atelectasis versus effusion.
unchanged from previous
.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV [**Last Name (STitle) 7216**] dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2129-4-7**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
somewhat reduced; other findings are similar.

EKG on admission: demonstrated sinus bradycardia with PR
prolongation, long QT interval, inverted T-waves in leads I,
aVL, V5-V6, and peaked T-waves in the precordial leads V1, V2.

EKG the following day: sinus brady resolved.  NSR with
resolution of long QT.  Inverted T waves persist, peaked T waves
have resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
58M PMH CAD-s/p CABG, DM, ESRD on HD, presented with
hyperkalemia, fluid overload, and chest pain in the setting of
acute renal failure.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Hyperkalemia - Likely [**1-28**] ESRD.  Unclear precipitant.  Patient
has been compliant with meds.  He reports diarrhea so if
anything it would likely have decreased his potassium.  Patient
does report some dietary indiscretion though which may account
for hyperkalemia.  EKG as above.  patient received urgent HD on
evening of admission.  The following morning, his potassium was
4.3.  He received scheduled HD.  We discontinued his lisinopril
thinking that if anything it may lead to increased potassium.
Patient will otherwise resume normal HD schedule.  Followup EKG
showed resolution of hyperkalemic changes.
.
# Cards ischemic: hx of known CAD.  He came in with atypical
chest pain.  It resolved rather promptly although we initially
treated with a heparin gtt while checking serial enzymes given
his risk for disease.  He received two sets of negative enzymes
and our suspicion for ischemia was low.  We stopped heparin gtt
prior to d/c.
.
# Cards rhythm: Sinus brady in the ED.  This can be [**1-28**]
hyperkalemia.  It resolved after HD and likely improvement of K.
.
# HTN: We held his ACEi as mentioned above.  We discharged
patient on Toprol XL 50 and added amlodipine 5 in setting of
holding the ACEi.  We discussed this with his PCP and further
adjustments will be made on an outpatient basis
.
# Cards Pump: A repeat echo suggested slightly worsened EF from
previous but otherwise no change.  We seemed well volume
regulated with HD.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
.
# Code: FULL
