Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Stable Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p DES of LAD


History of Present Illness:
79 yo male with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and CAD
s/p IMI with three stents placed in the RCA in [**2178-1-20**] was
admitted  for elective cardiac catheterization to evaluate new
onset of stable angina.
Patient usually walks [**2-21**] miles three times a week; however,
approximately one month ago he would consistently develop
substernal chest discomfort without radiations after walking
just .5 miles. This pain developed only with activity and would
resolve quickly with rest. Patient notes occasional
light-headedness but denies associated symptoms of nausea,
vomiting, or shortness of breath.
.
Patient was admitted on [**2184-11-16**] for an elective cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated 80%
stenosis of proximal LAD, 90% mid segment stenoses, LCX had
70-80% proximal
stenosis, and RCA 40% mid segment instent restenosis. Patient
had Cypher DES to proximal and mid LAD with plans to come in
again for intervention on the left circumflex. Post procedure
course was complicated by an episode of lightheadedness,
temperature to 100.6, HR decreased to 50 from 60-65, SBP
decreased to 70s from 120s. Lightheadedness and hypotension
resolved with lying flat and IVF. One day after cath and stent
placement, patient then developed temp to 103.5 with SBP to the
80s. Notable labs include UA with greater than 50 RBCs, [**11-8**]
WBCs, and moderate bacteria, and WBC to 7.7 from 4.4. Patient
had [**Month/Year (2) **] cultures drawn and received 1x dose of levofloxacin
prior to transfer to CCU.


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease
- status post catheterization in [**2178-1-20**], which revealed
normal
left main, 50% distal LAD, 30% proximal left circumflex, 80%
lower pole ramus, 80% proximal RCA, which was stented, 90%
mid RCA, which was stented, 70% distal RCA, which was
stented.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION - [**2184-1-17**]
PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiogram demonstratedserial stenoses
in the
proximal and mid LAD in the order of 80 and 90% severity. It was
planned
to treat these lesions with PTCA and stenting. Heparin was the
anticoagulant used during the procedure. A 6FXB LAD 4.0 guide
catheter
provided optimal support. The lesion was crossed with a Choice
PT XS
wire into the distal vessel. The lesion in the mid vessel was
pre-dilated with a 2.0 x 12 Quantum Maverick balloon at 16 ATM,
a  3.0 x 33 Cypher DES was deployed across this lesion at 16 ATM
and
A 3.0 x 23 Cypher DES was deployed aross the proximal lesion at
18 ATM
and post dilated with a 3.25 x 18 Powersail at 22 ATM. Final
angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis and no
angiographic
evidence of dissection, thrombus or perforation with TIMI III
flow in
the distal vessel. Towards the end of the case the patient has
persistent SBP in the 80s and 90s which was unexplained, however

resolved after placement of a Foley catheter.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD
had 80%
proximal, and 90% mid segment stenoses. The LCX had 70-80%
proximal
stenosis. The RCA had 40% mid segment instent restenosis.
2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated LVEDP 27mmHg.
3. [**Name (NI) 28283**] PTCA and stenting of the Rproximal and mid LADwith
3.00
Cypher DES respectively, the proximal stent was post dilated
with a 3.25
balloon. The final angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis
with no
angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation
with
TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.  (See PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Successful PCI of the proximal and mid LAD.
4. Staged intervention of the Diagonal branch and the LCx.

ECHO - [**2184-1-17**]
Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo male with past medical history significant for
hypertension and coronary artery disease s/p 3x RCA stent in
[**2177**] was admitted for elective cardiac catheterization due to
new onset x 1 month of chest pressure with .5 miles of walking
which improves with rest. Patient underwent catheterization
which demonstrated 80% stenosis of proximal LAD, 90% mid segment
stenoses, LCX had 70-80% proximal stenosis, and RCA 40% mid
segment instent restenosis. Patient had Cypher DES to proximal
and mid LAD with plans to come in again for intervention on the
left circumflex. Several hours after the procedure, his course
was complicated by an epi
