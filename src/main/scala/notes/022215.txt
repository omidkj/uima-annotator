History of Present Illness:
69 y.o male with hx notable for CAD s/p PTCA ([**2138**]) and NSTEMI
([**2-/2165**]) on plavix, Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% S/P
AICD [**2-2**] (generator change [**9-/2164**]), Liver failure [**2-28**] ETOH
abuse with Thrombocytopenia  and PVD s/p iliac stent ([**2158**]) with
a recent hospitalization [**5-6**] - [**5-15**] [**2165**] for recurrent MSSA
endocarditis. His pacing device was removed at that time and he
was placed on long-term nafcillin (5 weeks, last dose 5/23). He
had never been shocked by the device before.

He had an earlier hospitalization to OSH on [**2165-2-27**] for MSSA
endocarditis at which time he had respiratory failure requiring
intubation, at which time he had EKG showed inverted T waves
in leads II, III, avF.  TropT became elevated to 13.1.  He had a
second admission later in [**Month (only) 956**] to OSH for fevers, requiring
ICU stay and pressors.

He then completed multiple weeks of antibiotics, and quickly
after stopping antibiotics started to have fevers again and was
admitted for the [**Month (only) 547**] [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization for recurrent MSSA
bacteremia for which he was started on Nafcillin and had his
pacer leads removed.

The patient currently presents from Rehab with hypotension and
general malaise.  At OSH, ECG showed wide complex tachycardia
which appeared to be new LBBB.  On this ECG, he appeared to have
inferior ST elevations.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where
EKG demonstrated another morphology of wide-complex, regular
appearing tachycardia, presumed to be VT.  He was defibrillated
x2 in ED without rhythm conversion, so he was started on
lidocaine drip and taken to EP lab for EP study.

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 118 88/62 26 95% 4L.

The patient went to the EP lab, and it was determined that the
patient most likely has at least two different morphologies of
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, potentially secondary to
ischemia, although etiology unclear; other considerations for
etiology included junctional rhythm, atrial tachycardia with
ischemic changes.  In the EP lab, rhythm converted to sinus with
continued lidocaine drip.  Temporary pacing leads placed in
coronary sinus and RV for EP study.  He then became
hemodynamically unstable with episodes of hypotension, requiring
endotracheal intubation and initiation of pressors, so the EP
study was aborted.

The patient then underwent cardiac catheterization to assess the
coronary anatomy, demonstrating severe proximal and mid-LAD
disease; in addition, he was noted to have severe left
circumflex and RCA disease with good collaterals.  The LAD was
calcified, the proximal LAD was dilated and stented with a BMS,
with good result.

A balloon pump was placed in left groin with swan in right
groin.  Temp pacing wires in right groin were left in place for
AV sequentially pacing to be coordinated with balloon pump.  The
balloon pump was working well after adjusting for pacing. The
patient's blood pressure is augmenting well with balloon pump
and two pressors:  norepinephrine and phenylephrine.  The R
radial was used for the interventional procedure.

On arrival to the floor, patient is intubated and sedated,
ill-appearing.

BRIEF HISTORY:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20889**] is a 69 year old man with known ischemic
cardiomyopathy who
presented with VT. He was brought to the EP lab for mapping and
possible
ablation, but the VT was thought to be ischemic. He was referred
for
emergent cardiac catheterization due to VT and hemodynamic
instability

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Ventricular Tachycardia
Hypotension

PROCEDURE:
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation: was initiated with an
introducer
sheath using a Cardiac Assist 9 French 30cc wire guided
catheter,
inserted via the left femoral artery.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
bare-metal stent(s).
Peripheral Catheter placement was performed.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

**PTCA RESULTS
  LAD

PTCA COMMENTS:
Diagnostic angiography performed from right radial approach and
showed
three vessel coronary artery disease. The patient was
hypotensive
requiring norepinephrine and was intubated and sedated.
Descending
aortography showed patent aorta and patent known left iliac
stent.
Decision made to place IABP via left femoral access which
proceeded
without difficulty. MAP's stabilized and we proceeded with PCI.
Discussion occurred with family who confirmed wishes to proceed
with
aggressive therapy. Initial angiography showed a calcified LAD
with a
hazy, thrombotic appearing lesion in proximal vessel thought to
be
culprit and decision made to proceed with PTCA and stenting of
that
lesion (Lcx and RCA chronic disease). Heparin was continued in
addition
to integrilin. A 6F XBLAD 3.0 guiding catheter (via right
radial)
provided adequate support for the procedure. A Prowater wire
crossed the
lesion with minimal difficulty. We attempted to perform export
thrombectomy however the catheter would not pass the calcified
first
turn in the proximal LAD. We then dilated the proximal LAD with
a
2.5x12mm Apex OTW balloon and inflated to 10 atms for two
inflations
with improved appearance of the thrombus. WE deployed a 3.5x18mm

Integrity bare metal stent in the proximal LAD at 14 atms. The
proximal
segment of the stent was postdilated with a 3.5x12mm NC Quantum
apex Mr
balloon at 22 atms. Final angiography showed no residual
stenosis in
stented segment, an area of non flow limiting haziness
proximally, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow. The IABP
was
