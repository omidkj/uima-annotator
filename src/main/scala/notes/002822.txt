FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is little
overall change in the appearance of the right hemithorax. There
is still
extensive opacification along the right side of the trachea. For
further
evaluation, CT would be required.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-8**], there is little
change in the
appearance of the endotracheal tube. Nasogastric tube extends
well into the
stomach.
There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some
vascular engorgement
consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Atelectatic
changes are
seen at the bases and there are also small pleural effusions.

Final Report
HISTORY: Assess position of nasogastric tube.
Single portable radiograph of the abdomen excludes the right

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 F transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] s/p repair of
incarcerated ventral hernia w/o necrotic bowel on [**7-30**], with
acute respiratory decompensation @ [**Location (un) 620**], requiring
intubation. Transferred for further management. Possible h/o
aspiration perioperatively.

Resp: She was transferred here intubated and sedated. She had
partial right lung collapse and atelectasis. A Bronchoscopy
showed some mucous plugs. She continued with aggressive
pulmonary toilet and the ICU team was attempting to wean. She
was trach'd on [**8-9**] after having difficulty weaning.

On [**8-7**] BAL - staph aureus coag +, 3+ GPCs - Nafcillin
sensitive. This was switched to Augmentin and should continue
thru [**2185-8-20**].

She was then transitioned to a trach mask and was tolerating a
Passe Muir Valve.

CV: Stable with frequent PVC's. Continue with Lopressor.

GI/ABD: She was NPO with NGT in place. She was started in
tubefeedings via the NGT. She was evaluate by Speech and Swallow
and started on pureed solids and thin liquids.

Her incision was C/D/I with steri strips in place.

Renal: After receiving initial fluid resuscitation, she was then
diuresis with Lasix. Continue with diuresis as needed.

Endo: She required insulin for post-op hyperglycemia. As she is
able to tolerate more PO's, her home PO diabetic meds can be
restarted and the NPH can be weaned down.

Activity: She will continue to need PT as she had a prolonged
ICU course and is morbidly obese.
