HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented with a
chief complaint of chest pain.  The patient is a 45-year-old
man with a history of type 1 diabetes status post renal
transplant 20 years ago, with a history of known CAD with two
stents in the right coronary artery and the left circumflex
artery done in [**2119**], who presented on the day of admission
with exertional chest pain that began at 11 a.m. the day of
admission.  The patient had climbed a flight of stairs with
noted increased dyspnea on exertion, although he also
reported a one month history of dyspnea on exertion prior to
admission as well.

Approximately 10 minutes after the patient climbed the
stairs, he developed substernal and epigastric chest pain
that radiated to the left arm and back.  The patient
complained of back pain that was [**2126-7-25**], which decreased to
[**3-27**] after Morphine was given to the patient in the Emergency
Room.  The patient denied any nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis, or shortness of breath at rest.  The patient
described the pain as a pressure that was constant and which
felt heavy.

Upon further questioning by the initial primary medical team,
it was described that the patient had a report of this
similar type of chest pain ever since his stents had been
placed in [**2119**] and had recurrent pain of this sort every six
months.  The patient had been told in the past that it was
due to GERD, but stated that he did not believe this
diagnosis.  The patient also noted that nitroglycerin never
helped, and only gave him a headache.  The patient reported
that since he had been on methadone for chronic pain in the
past and on admission, that he needed increased and very high
amounts of Morphine to treat this pain.

The patient noted that he had just recently moved from
[**State 15946**], but had not experienced any colds or flus, no
vomiting, no nausea, no diarrhea, no constipation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Heart rate 98, blood
pressure of 116/50 or 86.  In the left arm, the blood
pressure is 119/73.  In the right arm, it was 124/81.  The
patient's temperature was 98.4, respiratory rate was 16, and
he was saturating 96 percent on room air.  His exam showed
that he was in no apparent distress.  His HEENT exam showed
that he has no reactive pupils.  Sclerae were anicteric.  His
neck showed jugular venous distention at 8 cm.  His chest was
clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes were noted.
His heart exam showed regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1,
S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdominal exam was
mildly distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly was noted.  His skin exam showed no
rashes.  His neurologic exam showed that he was alert and
oriented times three.  He has [**5-22**] motor strength in his upper
and lower extremities, and his sensory examination was
grossly intact.  His extremities showed [**1-19**] dorsalis pedis
pulses.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 8.8, hematocrit of
44.9, platelets of 358.  His sodium is 136, potassium was
6.1.  This was hemolyzed and redrawn, and the repeat
potassium was 3.5, bicarb of 24, BUN of 20, and a creatinine
of 1.2.  Patient's glucose was 122.  His initial set of
cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 135, MB of 2, and troponin
less than 0.01.

The patient's EKG on admission showed sinus rhythm with a
heart rate at 95, normal intervals, normal axis, poor R-wave
progression, Q in lead III, and otherwise no acute ST-T
changes.

The patient's chest x-ray showed a widen mediastinum.  The
patient then received chest and abdominal CT scan, which
showed a normal thoracic aorta, no mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy, and an abdominal aorta within normal limits.
The transplanted kidney was incompletely imaged, however,
there were no significant abnormalities, according to the
Radiology [**Location (un) 1131**].  It was also noted in the chest CT that
there were these 2 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodules in the
right upper lobe and right lower lobe.  Of note, the patient
reported that he had "fatty nodules" in his lungs that have
been noted and have remained stable since his renal
transplant 20 years prior to admission.

According to the patient's physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] in [**State 15946**],
the patient had received P-MIBI in the year [**2118**], which
showed a small inferior wall defect and underwent a cardiac
catheterization with a distal right stent and a mid circ
stent on [**2118-8-31**].  Several months later the patient
then had another P-MIBI, which showed a negative study, an EF
of over 60 percent.  Patient was also noted to have a history
of MRSA from a groin abscess in the past.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Room, the patient had been
given IV Morphine with relief of the patient's chest pain.
The patient was then admitted first to the Medicine service.
While in the Medicine service, patient underwent a P-MIBI on
[**5-31**], which was positive for inferior reversible defect.
On [**6-3**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization,
where he was found a right coronary artery restent thrombosis
and stenosis.  The patient had this restented with a Cypher
stent.

On [**6-3**] after the catheterization had been completed, the
patient was noted to have a new expressive aphasia, and there
is a concern for a new embolic stroke as a result.  The
Neurology consult service was notified and recommended
carotid studies and head CT.  The patient underwent two
negative head CT scans, and carotid studies that showed
normal flow.  The patient was started on a Heparin drip as
per Neurology recommendations.  It was recommended by the
Neurology team that the patient undergo a transesophageal
echocardiogram, however, since the patient complained of
dysphagia, the patient first underwent an EGD on [**6-4**].

The EGD showed that the patient was noted to have a
Schatski's ring, and although this was widely patent.

On [**6-5**], the patient was noted to have an acute event
consisting of temperature spike to 102 degrees, worsening
mental status, and continued aphasia, hypoxia with an ABG on
face mask of 7.43/41/51, and the patient was then transferred
to the ICU on the opposite campus.  The patient was never
intubated and his hypoxia resolved on his first day in the
ICU.  The patient was noted to have a multilobar pneumonia as
shown on a chest x-ray that was done on [**6-5**], and patient
was started on IV antibiotics including IV vancomycin and IV
Zosyn.  The patient also had sputum cultures that were drawn,
which showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in
pairs and clusters.  These eventually returned with as
speciosities that showed that the patient did have MRSA in
his sputum.  By the time the sensiti
