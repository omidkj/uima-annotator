Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arctic sun cooling protocol.

History of Present Illness:
53-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation presented
after having v-fib arrest. At her nursing home this morning she
was found down. EMS was called, finding her to be in v-fib. She
received shocks x 3, 6 mg total of epinephrine, 300 mg loading
dose of amiodarone then drip. Intubated in the field. She was
transported to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where she was given 1 unit of pRBCs.
Guaiac reportedly negative. Got a total of 2.5 L of NS. Started
on Artic Sun before med flight to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was found cold with 8mm fixed
pupils bilaterally and no response to stimuli. SBP was in the
140s-160s without pressor, HR 50s-60s. ECG showed... She got a
head CT and chest CTA. Transferred to CCU for further
management.
.
Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2161-8-12**] to [**2161-8-17**]
for syncope and runs of VT. Prior to this admission, OSH ETT had
shown possible mild basal inferior ischemia vs. attenuation
artifact with overall normal systolic function. She underwent
cardiac catheterization, which showed a 90% distal RCA stenosis,
and a DES was placed in the RCA. TTE and TEE showed a large (21
mm) secundum atrial septal defect with LVEF>55%. Review of her
strip rhythm suggested that her arrhythmia may be atrial in
origin rather than ventricular tachycardia. For that reason, she
underwent an EP study on [**2161-8-14**], which included ventricular
stimulation as well as assessment for atrial arrhythmias.  She
was found to have inducible atrial flutter, that was typical
counter clockwise flutter and she had a successful isthmus
ablation. She had no sustained ventricular tachycardia with
ventricular stimulation protocol. She was evaluated by the
cardiac surgeons as well as the interventional cardiologists for
percutaneous surgical closure of her large secundum ASD, and it
was deemed that this should be done as an outpatient. In
addition, with her history of significant atrial arrhythmias and
atrial fibrillation, it was thought that a pulmonary vein
isolation procedure would be beneficial prior to any closure of
her secundum ASD.

ECHO [**11-6**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A large secundum atrial septal defect is
present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**11-7**] CXR:
New right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. ET tube is in
standard
position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly is
stable. The main pulmonary arteries are dilated. Multifocal
consolidations
in the upper and lower lobes have improved. There is no
pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.
.
[**11-8**] MRI head:
FINDINGS: Increased FLAIR-T2 signal in the entire cerebral
cortex, medial
temporal lobe (hippocampus) and basal ganglia and thalamus
correspond to areas of decreased diffusion. There is no
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  The ventricles and
extra-axial spaces are within normal limits. Flow void in
visualized intracranial arteries is consistent with their
patency. Mucosal thickening with probable air-fluid levels in
the bilateral sphenoid sinuses are noted. Visualized orbits are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. No intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
[**11-12**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the
monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The
ventilation of the lung parenchyma is improved. However, a
pre-existing small retrocardiac atelectasis is slightly
increased in extent. Minimal areas of atelectasis are also seen
at the medial basal right aspect of the hemithorax. Focal
parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia are not present.
Marked cardiomegaly with signs of mild overhydration and
increase of the carinal angle, most likely caused by increasing
diameter of the left atrium. No evidence of pneumothorax, no
larger pleural effusions.
.
EEG [**11-6**]:
This is an abnormal video EEG study due to a burst
suppression pattern with initial frequent electrographic
seizures
consisting of persistent eye opening and upward deviation that
improved
in frequency and duration over the course of this recording.
Compared
to the first half of this recording when rare electrographic
seizures
were occurring every five to ten minutes and lasting up to eight
seconds
in duration, there were no seizures in the latter half of this
record.
Electrographic seizures increased in duration with increase in
midazolam
doses, then abated and were replaced by a burst-suppression
pattern
after propofol was started. These findings are indicative of
severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and nonconvulsive status
epilepticus, both
of which portend a poor neurologic outcome in this patient with
anoxic
brain injury.
.
[**11-10**] EEG:
This is an abnormal video EEG study due to burst
suppression in background activity with intermittent 1 Hz
generalized
sharp and slow wave discharges with bifrontal predominance
consistent
with generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs). These

findings suggest a severe encephalopathy consistent with the
patient's history of
