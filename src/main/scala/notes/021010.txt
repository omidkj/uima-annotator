HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 year-old male with
a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, right
hemidiaphragm paralysis and diabetes type I who presents with
tracheal stenosis, status post a prolonged intubation and
tracheostomy in [**2182-9-27**]. He was decannulated in
[**2182-12-27**] and then required tracheal resection and
reconstruction in [**2183-1-27**] on [**2-7**].  He is now
readmitted for stenosis at the anastomosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.9;
heart rate 86; blood pressure 146/82; respiratory rate was 18
and he was 95% on room air. He was in no apparent distress
and was a very well-nourished man. Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Neck was supple
without lymphadenopathy, masses or thyromegaly. His lungs
were coarse bilaterally with occasional display of stridor.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub or
gallop. Abdomen was soft, obese and nontender throughout.
Normoactive bowel sounds. He was noted to have 1+ pitting
peripheral edema distally in his ankles.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Obesity, obstructive sleep apnea,
hypertension, diabetes type I, restrictive lung disease,right
hemidiaphragm paralysis post motorcycle accident, chronic venous
stasis, rectal abscesses, nasal polyposis, patent foramen ovale.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Prednisone 30 mg b.i.d., Ativan,
Trazodone, lisinopril, Combivent, Flonase, metoprolol 25 mg
b.i.d., insulin, Protonix 40 daily, Tamsulosin 0.4 h.s.,
regular insulin sliding scale, Lantus 35 units b.i.d.,
Pregabalin 50 mg t.i.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time, the patient was admitted to
the interventional pulmonary service under the care of Dr.
[**Name (NI) **] on [**2183-3-31**]. On [**3-31**], the patient was
brought to the operating room and had a flexible bronchoscopy
with significant granulation tissue noted with a 5 mm
orifice. This was in a section approximately 1 cm in length,
through which they could easily pass the bronchoscope into
the distal section of the trachea. There were no biopsies
taken at this time.

Then on [**2183-4-1**] after further evaluation, the patient
was brought down for rigid bronchoscopy with flexible
bronchoscopy as well with excission of the granulation tissue as
well as bronchial washings and placement of a stent. The area of
stricture and stenosis was also balloon dilated. This was
noted to be 2 cm below the vocal cords, at the site of the
prior anastomosis. This was dilated up to 16 mm.  A silicone
stent was employed measuring 16 x 40 mm.  The patient was
extubated postoperatively and brought to the CSRU at this
time. His gases were very concerning at this time for
significant carbon dioxide retention. However, as he wore off
narcotics and anesthesia, he improved his respiratory status and
he was gradually able to ventilate more effectively and reduce
this C02 retention. He received fairly aggressive chest physical
therapy and pulmonary toilette at this time along with nebulizer
treatments and non-invassive ventilation.  Sleep medicine was
consulted due to his severe OSA and will recommend empiric
settings and arrange outpatient sleep follow-up.  During his stay
he had 2 cultures drawn; one of bronchial washings that revealed
3+ gram negative rods and 2+ gram positive cocci, growing
hemophilus influenza, beta lactamase negative, greater than
100,000 organisms. Sensitivity is pending at this time. He also
had urine culture that grew Proteus, just [**2176**] organisms per ml.
Chest x-rays were reassuring in the postoperative period. PICC
line was also placed; however, decision was then made at the time
of discharge to send the patient home on p.o. Augmentin so the
PICC line was discontinued.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will be discharged to
rehab and to be continued on Augmentin for 10 more days. He was
discharged on Bi-Pap.  To [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD or come to ER if having
worsening fevers, pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, shortness of
breath, chest pain or with any questions or concerns.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol 325 to 650 p.o. every 4 to 6
hours as needed for pain or fever; albuterol inhalers; Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d., guaifenesin 1200 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. daily, regular insulin
sliding scale, Atrovent, lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q. daily,
metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., miconazole powder; Percocet 1
to 2 tablets p.o. every 4 to 6 hours prn.  Protonix 40 mg
p.o. q. 24 hours. Augmentin 875/125 one tablet p.o. b.i.d. x
10 days.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. daily. Pregabalin 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg p.o. h.s. BiPAP 10/5 cmH20

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to
 rehab.
