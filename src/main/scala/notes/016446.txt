Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardoac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
86 year old  male with history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2175**],
congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus presents with 4
days of worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, and lower
extremity edema.

Patient speaks primarily Polish with some English, so history
was obtained from patient's son [**Name (NI) 429**] [**Name (NI) 39211**] and son (also HCP)
[**Name (NI) 30564**] [**Name (NI) 39211**] over the phone.

[**Name (NI) **] son reports that patient has been generally in
declining health over the last several months. He lives
primarily in [**Last Name (LF) 6079**], [**First Name3 (LF) 108**]. His son reports that his
recent course has been notable for left leg ulcerations and
recent vascular bypass surgery in [**State 108**] this past [**Month (only) **].
Recently he has also developed a right leg ulceration. The
patient was rehospitalized in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] for for dyspnea,
congestion, ?Pneumonia.  [**11-19**] TTE: LAE, conc LVH, LVEF 60% w/o
WMA but LV dilation.  [**Name (NI) **] son also went to visit patient
in [**State 108**] in [**Month (only) 404**] and noted a 22 pound weight gain over 2
weeks. The patient was then hospitalized once again on [**12-20**] and
ws treated for CHF exacerbation thought [**12-30**] diastolic
dysfunction.  Given patient's worsening health, patient's family
had patient fly to [**State 350**]. He arrived in [**Hospital1 789**] at
1pm on [**2187-1-3**] and family brought patient to [**Hospital1 18**] ED due to
increased lower extremity edema, difficulty walking, shortness
of breath, and chest pressure.  Of note, per son, recent [**Name2 (NI) **]
showed creatinine of 1.3 in [**Known firstname **] and [**Month (only) 216**] of '[**85**].

Upon arrival to the ED, temp 97.4, HR 110, BP 125/79, RR 18,
pulse ox 100% RA. Patient received aspirin 325mg x 1, NGSL .4 x
1 and then Nitro gtt, lasix 40mg IV x1, morphine 2mg IV x 2,
plavix 75 x 1, aspirin 81mg x 1, Labetalol 100mg x 1. He put out
approximately 2L from his foley. His UOP was complicated by
hematuria. Urology was consulted and recommended placement of 3
way foley. Patient has now been weaned from Nitro gtt.

STUDIES:
- [**2187-1-4**] CXR - Mild CHF. No definite pneumonia.

- ECG - [**2187-1-4**] - sinus rhythm with wide QRS, 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depressions in II, avF, V5 and V6

- ECHO [**1-4**]: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30
%) secondary to akinesis of the interventricular septum and
anterior free wall; there is extensive apical akinesis; the
remaining segments are hypokinetic, except for the basal
posterior and lateral walls which are relatively well-preserved.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Findings are
consistent with multiple vessel coronary artery disease and
extensive prior myocardial infarction.

- Bladder U/S [**1-6**]:
FINDINGS: Limited grayscale son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation demonstrates
a partially distended bladder containing a Foley catheter.
Layering echogenic foci within the dependent portion of the
bladder likely represent a small amount of debris/blood
products. No gross mass is seen, although evaluation is limited
secondary to underdistention of the bladder.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. No large bladder mass seen. Echogenic
layering material in the dependent portion of the bladder likely
representing debris or blood products.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed severe multivessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had a 60%
distal lesion.  The LAD had a 70% proximal lesion and was 100%
occluded
after D1.  D1 had a long 50% stenosis.  The LCX had a 99%
proximal
stenosis.  The RCA had a 50% ostial lesion and a long 70-80%
stenosis
throughout its course.
2. Graft angiography revealed a SVG to LAD with 30% mid stenosis
and
diffuse distal disease in the LAD.  The SVG to D1 was t
