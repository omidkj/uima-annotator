Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
female with a past medical history remarkable for
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, who presents with increased dyspnea on
exertion for the past one year.  Patient has noted worsening
of this condition in the past two to three months with
dyspnea resolving at rest.  Patient also had one episode of
chest pain which radiated into left arm in early [**Month (only) 547**] which
resolved spontaneously at rest.  Baseline murmur has been
noted on cardiac exam for several years.  In evaluating this
cardiac symptom, patient underwent a cardiac catheterization
on [**2129-6-1**] which revealed aortic valve area of .84 and
severe aortic stenosis with severe mitral regurgitation 3+.
Patient's right ventricular end-diastolic pressure was noted
to be 18, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 34,
ejection fraction to be 62%, with left anterior descending
with mild diffuse disease and right coronary artery 40%
occluded.  Cardiac echocardiogram which was performed on
[**2129-5-16**] suggested similar results with peak gradient
of 77 and aortic valve area of .67 with mild left ventricular
hypertrophy and moderate mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
hypertension.  Given these findings, patient was referred to
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for aortic valve replacement,
as well as mitral valve replacement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an 86-year-old female with
a past medical history remarkable for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
who presents with severe aortic stenosis and mitral
regurgitation.  For these reasons, patient underwent a
successful preoperative evaluation by Cardiothoracic Surgery
Service and underwent an uncomplicated aortic valve
replacement (21 mm c.e. bioprosthetic valve) and mitral valve
repair (26 mm Cogsgrove annuloplasty band) on [**2129-7-18**].

Postoperatively, the patient maintained normal sinus rhythm
sedated on propofol and pressure maintained with mild amount
of >......<.  On postoperative day number one, patient
exhibited labile hemodynamics and was maintained on apaced
rhythm, as well as SIMV ventilator setting.  By postoperative
day number two, the patient was transfused two units of
packed red blood cells and extubated with discontinuation of
pacer, since patient maintained normal sinus rhythm.  At this
time, chest tubes were also removed without incident.

On postoperative day number three, patient was initiated on
po Lopresor, as well as Lasix for diuresis and patient was
transferred to the floor since no further evidence of labile
blood pressure nor respiratory instability were noted.

By postoperative day number four, patient was evaluated by
the Physical Therapy Service to determine whether the
additional rehabilitation service would be required prior to
patient returning back home.  The evaluation yielded the
conclusion that discharge to rehabilitation would provide the
best environment for quick recovery.

By postoperative day number six, on [**7-24**], the decision was
made to discharge the patient to a rehabilitation facility.
By this time, cardiac medications were properly re-titrated.


CONDITION OF DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post aortic valve replacement (21 mm c.e.
bioprosthetic valve).
2.  Mitral valve repair (26 mm Cogsgrove annuloplasty band).

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Albuterol nebulizer solution q. 6 hours prn wheeze.
2.  Atenolol 75 mg po q.d.
3.  Dilaudid 2-4 mg po q. 4-6 hours prn pain.
4.  Lasix 40 mg po q.d. times seven days.
5.  After the initial seven days, patient is to be revaluated
by a physician who will determined whether further diuretic
will be necessary.  Patient is also to take potassium
replacement 40 mEq po b.i.d. during the duration of above
Lasix administration.
6.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
7.  Captopril 6.25 mg po t.i.d.
8.  Levothyroxine sodium 115 mcg po q.d.
9.  Glyburide 1.25 mg po b.i.d.
10. Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
