History of Present Illness:
68-year-old female with chronic neck/back pain on high dose
narcotics who presents with altered mental status. Her mental
status has been poor for the past two days and her family
suspects she took too many narcotics. No known nausea/vomiting
or fever/chills. Family called EMS today where she was found
sitting on the couch slumped over to her right. She was "out of
it like this since Thursday (2 days prior to admission)." EMS
found patient to be moaning with minimal movement and pupils
were 3mm and sluggishly reactive. 1L NS was given and 1mg narcan
was given. EMS reported after narcan "patient opens her eyes and
responds verbally to EMS questioning, some words are
understandable and correct in their response, while others are
incomprehensible." She was given another 1mg narcan en route to
OSH, however there was no documented response after this dose.
At the OSH, AST/ALT were elevated in the thousands, APAP level
negative. CT head showed no acute intracranial process. CXR
showed minimal right basilar atelectasis. She was intubated for
airway protection.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals: were afebrile SBP 70-80s,
minimally responsive. Subclavian CVL placed and norepinephrine
started. BP improved to 120/60. Received 2 doses of NAC.
Vancomycin and zosyn given. She recieved 5L NS with minimal
urine output. ECG showed sinus rhythm at 74bpm, RAD with ST
depressions v3-v6. Labs notable for AST 617 ALT 750 CK 3800, Cr
4.1, BUN 50, HCO3 20, K 3.1, lactate 1.5, WBC 11.7, HCT 33, INR
4.4. Urine tox positive for benzodiazepines and opiates. Serum
tox negative for ASA, ETOH, APAP, TCA, benzo, barbs. UA with 56
WBC moderate leukesterase and few bacteria and hyaline casts.
Seen by toxicology who recommended evaluation of gap, continuing
NAC. Vitals prior to transfer: 36.7C, HR 65 RR 22 100% 126/53.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she awoke and nearly pulled out her ET
tube. She opens her eyes to voice and follows simple commands.
She was breathing comfortably.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2119-7-1**] Blood cultrue: no growth to date
[**2119-7-2**] Urine culture: no growth
.
IMAGING:
[**2119-7-1**] CXR: Single portable view of the chest. No prior.
Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 4.5 cm from the
carina. Endotracheal tube is seen coiled in the stomach with tip
at the gastric fundus. The lungs are clear of large confluent
consolidation or effusion. Cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. ET and enteric
tubes as above.
.
[**2119-7-3**] CT Head w/o con: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent, consistent with generalized atrophy. Periventricular
white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. The basal cisterns are patent and
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. There is no
fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells,
and middle ear cavities are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2119-7-4**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, patient
has received a new endotracheal tube with the tip projects 5 cm
above the carina. The other monitoring and support devices are
constant. Unchanged lung volumes. Unchanged size of the cardiac
silhouette. The right hilus appears a little more prominent,
likely because of patient rotation. No new parenchymal
opacities, pleural effusion or other lung parenchymal
abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
68-year-old female with chronic neck/back pain on high dose
narcotics who presented with altered mental status and shock.
.
# Altered mental status: Likely secondary to narcotic overdose
given high home doses of oxycodone/oxycontin and reported
improvement with narcan by EMS. Narcotics were initially held
with continued improvement in mental status. CT head negative
for bleed, stroke, or other acute process. Tox screen negative
and no metabolic abnormalities. EEG negative for seizure
activity. Patient was treated empirically with vanc/zosyn which
were discontinued when there were no signs of infection (UA
negative, CXR negative, blood cultures no growth to date). We
restarted Oxycodone liquid 5mg Q8h prn pain, but are holding the
oxycontin and gabapentin. Could consider restarting as
