74 yoM s/p OLT for cryptogenic cirrhosis on [**2122-4-29**] who was
discharged yesterday to [**Hospital3 **], now presents from rehab
after running a fever to 103 F.  He was transiently hypotensive
to 90's systolic which responded to IVF bolus.  He now presents
in ED stating he is in pain and localizes to his back and his
abdomen.  It is diffuclt to assess, however, because he states
the pain has been there since before his transplant.  He then
counters that this pain is much worse.  He complains of
abdominal pain only with palpation and he complains of
difficulty breathing when palpating his abdomen.  According to
his family, his mental status has not declined.

ROS: Overall this is a difficult history to extract.  He does
not endorse nausea or vomiting.  He denies diarrhea and denies

abnormalities but he says he is too weak to walk.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o male readmitted from Rehab with fever. Patient was sent
on arrival to ED for a CT scan which showed Left upper lobe
ground-glass opacities likely representing early pneumonia and
post-surgical changes with edema in the porta hepatis and a
large simple subphrenic fluid collection measuring about 10 x 5
cm.
Blood and urine cultures were sent. From the previous
hospitalization he had grown E faecalis and so was started on
Vancomycin and Cefepime.
An ID consult was obtained, and they recommended 8 days of
Cefepime, 14 days of Vancomycin. PICC line was placed.
Additionally an MRI of the neck was done showing no evidence of
a prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue collection. No
evidence of an infective process in this unenhanced study. There
were degenerative changes with mild to moderate canal narrowing.

The patient continued tube feeds via dobhoff and was tolerating.
PT evaluated patient and recommended he discharge back to rehab.
He is ambulating with minimal assist, but needs assistance with
tube feeds and antibiotics.
