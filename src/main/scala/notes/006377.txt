Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
status post elective cardiac catheterization for recent dyspnea
on exertion, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-7-4**] Coronary artery bypass grafting (off pump) times three
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM and SVG to DIAG)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 24085**] is a 61-year-old female with HTN, +tobacco history,
recent persistent SOB on exertion with some associated CP who is
being admitted status post cardiac catheterization after note of
severe left main, LCX, LAD and RCA coronary artery disease. No
interventions or stenting performed today. She is being admitted
for management and possible CABG. Of note, she had a recent
persatine stress test with apical ischemia as well. More
specifically, in terms of coronary artery disease, today's
cardiac catheterization showed 70% mid-LMCA, subtotally occluded
mid-LAD lesion, 70% ostial LCX and mild to moderate RCA diffuse
disease. Renal angiography showed mild disease in right renal
artery and distal aortogram with 70-80% lesion.
.
On further history she describes having 6 months of progressive
DOE with associated "pressure like" [**3-21**] chest discomfort with
exertional activities such as climbing stairs. Also reports
associated claudication symptoms which have been long standing.
No prior MIs.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of PND,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On arrival to the medical floor initial vitals were: afebrile,
BP 158/56, HR 70, O2 Sat 96% RA, RR 20. Patient in no distress,
comfortable.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The LA is normal in size. LV wall thickness
normal and LV cavity size normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The MV
leaflets mildly thickened. Borderline PA systolic HTN. No
pericardial effusion.

Appropriate rise in HR and decrease in BP with persantine.
Occasional PVCs. Evidence of small apical perfusion abnormality
at stress which shows mild reversibility at rest. Gated SPECT
imaging with normal LVEF, no discrete wall motion abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 24085**] was admitted to the cardiac medicine service with
severe three vessel coronary artery disease ( 70% left main
occlusion), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
depression/anxiety, and recent complaints of dyspnea.  A cadiac
catheterization during her admission revealed a 70% mid-LMCA,
subtotally occluded mid-LAD lesion, 70% ostial LCX and mild to
moderate RCA diffuse disease. A recent persantine stress test
noted apical reversible perfusion deficits. ON [**7-4**] she
underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting times three (off
pump).  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in critical
but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  She
was extubated and weaned from her pressors.  By the following
day she was transferred to the step down floor.  Her chest tubes
and epicardial wires were removed and she was diuresed toward
her preoperative weight.  Wellbutrin was initiated to help Ms.
[**Known lastname 24085**] with smoking cessation.  By post operative day four she
was ready for discharge to home.
