History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 yo F with CAD s/p MI, DM-II, s/p recent infected
plantar ulcer s/p debridement on Friday at NE [**Hospital1 **] admittedw
with fever and early sepsis.
.
She underwent debridement on [**2155-4-4**], and was started on clinda
and cipro following. She developed temps in the 99 range on
Saturdaym and then 102.7 on Sunday early morning, accompanied
with vomiting and nausea. She was taken into the ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED her vitals were as follows; T 100.1, HR 90, BP 144/53,
RR 20, O2 sat 97% RA. She received vanc, ceftaz, clindamycin,
and [**Date Range 11958**] in ED. She was noted to have pallor of the foot
and a non-blanching rash ?petechiae on her arms and legs on
exam. Her initial hct was 27. It later fell to 24 after about 3L
of IVF (guaiac neg on exam). She was also felt to be in DIC
based on her exam with petechiae; she had elevated INR to 1.5
but Fibrinogen was high at 818. Her lactate was 2.5.
.
She was also noted to have an elevated Troponin and ST
depressions on EKG. Cardiology was [**Name (NI) 653**], and recommended no
anticoagulation at this time. She was transfused 2u PRBC in ED.
She had abdominal tenderness in the ED on exam, and an abdominal
CT was performed and negative.
.
On admission to the ICU, the patient was initially comfortable
for the initial exam and assessment. She shortly thereafter
developed [**8-7**] chest discomfort, and a drop in her oxygen
saturation to 89-90 on supplemental NC ~ 4L. She was pain free
after 2 SL NTG. Her CXR showed interval opacification c/w fluid
overload.
.
On Review of Systems, she also notes dyspnea on exertion of
recent increasing severity, and a h/o vertigo. No h/o cough, no
dysuria, and no chest pain. All other ROS negative in detail.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases demonstrate
minimal dependent atelectasis. Heart size is normal. There are
no pleural or pericardial effusions.

The liver is diffusely nodular compatible with cirrhosis. No
focal lesion in the liver on this noncontrast study. Prominence
of the common bile duct is again noted which is likely related
to post-cholecystectomy status. Non- contrast evaluation of the
spleen demonstrates no focal lesion with size in the range of
normal The pancreas and left adrenal gland appear normal. There
may be mild nodular thickening of the right adrenal gland though
imaging is quite limited through this region. The kidneys appear
normal in size and are without evidence for stones or
hydronephrosis. There is no lymphadenopathy. Extensive vascular
calcification of the splenic artery is noted.

The large and small bowel are unremakable without evidence of
obstruction. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. Small hiatal hernia is noted. No free fluid,
free air or evidence of fluid collection.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid are unremarkable
except for scattered diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis. There is no free fluid or free air.
Calcification in the uterine wall and right ovary noted, stable
from [**2152**].

Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted. Subcutaneous
opacities in the anterior abdominal wall likely reflect
medication injection sites.

IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intra-abdominal pathology.

2. Cirrhotic liver.

3. Diverticulosis.

FOOT AP/LAT/OBLIQUE
FINDINGS: There has been interval progression of the Charcot
arthropathy with increase in the heterotopic bone formation,
osteopenia, and destructive erosive changes around the joints.
The posterior dislocation of the calcaneus is unchanged. The
subluxation of second through fifth metatarsal bone are
consistent with chronic Lisfranc deformity. There is plantar
soft tissue swelling along the midfoot with defect in the skin
compatible with known ulcer. The underlying bone appears intact.
No subcutaneous gas is identified. No radiopaque foreign body is
noted within the soft tissues.
.
IMPRESSION:

Interval progression of the Charcot deformity. Soft tissue
prominence with skin ulceration along the plantar surface of the
midfoot. No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
ECHO [**2155-4-7**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
(2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. T
