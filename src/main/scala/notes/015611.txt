Date of Birth:   [**2067-10-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 59-year-old
female with an extensive cardiac history including coronary
artery disease (three vessel) status post coronary artery
bypass graft x 3 in [**2120**], re-do in [**2123**], atrial fibrillation
status post DDD pacemaker in [**2123**], end stage congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%,
hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
peripheral vascular disease, not a candidate for heart
transplant, on home dopamine drip and Hospice status,
reversed to full code during this admission, initially
presenting with chest pain and ruled out for myocardial
infarction and now called out of the Coronary Care Unit and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team for EP evaluation of apparent
tachy arrhythmia.  The patient reportedly had tachycardia up
to the 170s by EMS in the field, and resolved with 20 mg of
intravenous Diltiazem x 1.  During this hospital stay, the
patient has had no nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on
telemetry.  The patient has only occasional sinus tachycardia
and premature ventricular contractions, as well as atrial
tachycardia with 2:1 block.  The patient was comfortable and
asymptomatic while on the floor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service):   Vital
signs:  Temperature 97.8, blood pressure 108/44, heart rate
112, respiratory rate 15 to 20, oxygen saturation 98% on room
air.  General:  No acute distress, alert and awake.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Jugular venous pressure to
approximately 10 cm.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, regular
rhythm, loud S1, normal S3, III/VI systolic ejection murmur
at the left lower sternal border.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally, without rales, rhonchi or wheezes.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, with normal active
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Trace edema bilaterally in the
lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:   White blood cells 9.1, hematocrit 30.2.
Sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 102, bicarbonate 327, BUN
24, creatinine 0.5, glucose 167.  Calcium 8.8, phosphate 3.5,
magnesium 1.9, Digoxin 1.7.  Telemetry:  Atrial tachycardia
with 2:1 block, occasional premature ventricular
contractions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 59-year-old female with an
extensive cardiac history, including end stage congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20% on
home dopamine, found to have an apparent tachy arrhythmia in
the field.  The patient was initially accepted to the
Coronary Care Unit given the patient was on home dopamine
drip, and then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for EP
evaluation for possible AICD vs. amiodarone for rate control.

The [**Hospital 228**] medical regimen at home was continued while
in-hospital.Pacer interrogation showed underlying rhythm was
atrial tachycardia   The EP service performed atrial pacing,
atrialardia
patient was paced out of her atrial tachycardia.  The patient
was then DDDR paced at 70 beats per minute with isolated
premature ventricular contractions.  The patient was started
on an amiodarone loading schedule at 800 mg once daily for
one week, 600 mg once daily for three weeks, and 200 mg once
daily thereafter.  The patient's Digoxin was discontinued.
The patient was restarted on her Coumadin.

The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as
the Device Clinic in three weeks.  The patient was discharged
home in stable condition.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease
2.  Atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal
3.  End stage congestive heart failure with ejection fraction
of less than 20% on home dopamine drip
4.  Hypertension
5.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
6.  Hypercholesterolemia
7.  Peripheral vascular disease
8.  DDD pacemaker
9.  Anemia of chronic disease
10. Regular atrial tachyarrhythmia with variable block, pace
terminated.  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dopamine drip 8 mcg/kg/minute
2.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth
3.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily

6.  Trazodone 50 mg by mouth daily at bedtime
7.  Enalapril 5 mg by mouth twice a day
8.  Mesalamine 500 mg rectally once daily
9.  Amiodarone 800 mg by mouth once daily for one week, 600
mg by mouth once daily for three weeks, 200 mg by mouth once
daily ongoing
10. Lasix 80 mg every morning, 40 mg every evening
11. Iron 325 mg by mouth three times a day
12. Sertraline 150 mg once daily
13. Oxycontin 10 mg by mouth once daily
