PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs on admission
were significant for a temperature of 98.1, a heart rate of
92, a blood pressure of 107/62, respiratory rate of 18, and
an oxygen saturation of 95% with nasal cannula rate not
specified.  The patient was in no acute distress.  She was
alert and oriented times three.  Her heart was in regular
sinus rhythm.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  The left lower quadrant ostomy site was viable
and pink.  There was stool visibly leaking out of a small
defect in the midline incision.  The defect was found to be
from the ostomy to the subcutaneous tissue with no defect
found in the fascia.  Of note, there was also a PEG in place
in the right upper quadrant.  Examination of the buttocks
revealed a large deep sacral decubitus ulcer that was clean.
There was no visible bone exposure.

STUDIES:  CBC on admission was significant for a white blood
cell count of 12,100 with 76% neutrophils.  Hematocrit was
30.2%, platelet count was 834,000.  Chemistry was remarkable
for a sodium of 132, potassium of 5.2, a chloride of 93,
bicarbonate level of 32, a BUN level of 18, and a creatinine
of 0.3.  Her glucose was 88.

Her coagulation studies were unremarkable.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis:  Was significant for a small
fluid collection in the subcutaneous fat adjacent to the new
colostomy site.  There was small gas and fluid tract
extending from the peritoneal origin of the colostomy to the
midline skin surface.  There were no intraperitoneal fluid
collections.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the hospital in preparation for surgery to repair the
enterocutaneous fistula.  The patient was given a bowel
preparation on the day of admission.  She was then taken to
the OR.  The colon had become ischemic between the fascia and
skin level and stool had tracted subcutanesouly.  There was no
intra-abdominal fistula.  The colostomy was resited.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by
tachycardia on postoperative days one and two.  As a result,
the metoprolol was increased to 7.5 mg IV q.6, on
postoperative day #2, hospital day #4.  Patient also
developed some erythema around the stoma site on hospital day
two, postoperative day four, and was started on Kefzol 1 gram
IV q.8 in addition to the meropenem she was already receiving
for treatment of her sacral decubitus ulcer.

In the evening of postoperative day #2, hospital day #4, the
patient became acutely short of breath with a desaturation to
85%.  Her heart rate had elevated above her baseline sinus
tachycardia to approximately 129.

On physical exam, the patient was wheezy throughout with
crackles.  A stat portable chest x-ray suggested pulmonary
edema consistent with congestive heart failure.  Blood gas on
the floor was consistent with respiratory acidosis.  As a
result, the patient was given 20 of IV Lasix.  She was
transferred to the care of the Intensive Care Unit.

Because of concern for her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease as a component of her respiratory dysfunction, her
Lopressor was discontinued.  She was started on diltiazem for
control of tachycardia.  She diuresed well with lasix and her
dyspnia resolved.

On hospital day #5, a decision was made to discontinue
Dilantin because the patient did not have a clear diagnosis
of seizure disorder.  Previous seizure had been in the
setting of sepsis and patient had no seizures in the past
year on subtherapeutic antiepileptic medications.

On hospital day #6, postoperative day #4, the patient was
discharged from the Intensive Care Unit to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 unit.

On hospital day #7, postoperative day #5, the patient began
to have gas in the ostomy bag.  As a result, the patient was
advanced to a full-liquid diet.

On hospital day #8, postoperative day #6, the patient was
advanced to a house diet.  The patient was given nutritional
supplementation and consultation with the Nutrition service.

On hospital day #9, postoperative day #7, the patient was
found to be persistently tachycardic.  As a result, her dose
of diltiazem was increased from 30 mg p.o. q.d. to 60 mg p.o.
q.d.  Her nebulizer doses were also decreased in an effort to
control tachycardia.  This was found to improve her heart
rate.

On hospital day #11, postoperative day #9, the patient began
to have softl brown liquidy material from the ostomy.  As a
result, the patient was discharged on hospital day #12,
postoperative day #10.
