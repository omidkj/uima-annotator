History of Present Illness:
67yo female with CAD, DMII, ESRD who was initially admitted for
SOB on [**2196-10-4**].  Pt complained of increased SOB after dialysis
and was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring of

signs of mild ST depression in I, aVL and poor R wave
progression.  Pt ruled in for NSTEMI with CK peak of 207 and
trop peak of 2.22 while in the MICU.  Pt denied CP,
palpitations, SOB.

[**2196-10-5**] Echo:
LVEF 30%
"The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior
and inferolateral walls. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular cavity size and systolic
function are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but not stenotic. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of
[**3-/2188**], the findings are new."

[**2196-10-6**] Cardiac Catheterization:
"INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class , unstable. Prior
PTCA
[**2193**]. Drop in echocardiolographic ejection fraction in the
setting of
elevated cardiac troponin levels.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right-sided filling pressure.
3. Successful stenting of the LAD.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
system
with three vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had a 40% ostial
stenosis
with damping. The LAD had a hazy ostial 70% stenosis, 50% mid,
and 60%
mid to distal lesions. The LCX artery had diffuse 40% proximal
and 95%
OM2 lesions. The RCA had 50%, 50% RCA, 50% mid to distal, 60%
distal,
and 80% diffusely diseased PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided
filling
pressures (PCWP mean 28 mmHg), borderline pulmonary hypertension
(PA
mean 40 mmHg)
3. Left ventriculography deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial LAD with a 2.5 mm
Cypher
drug-eluting stent, which was post-dilated to 3.0 mm."


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67yo female with CAD s/p MI, DMII with ESRD presents with
acute onset SOB after dialysis who ruled in for NSTEMI with CK
peak of 207 and troponin peak of 2.22.

SOB: The patient received a portable Echo in the MICU which
showed new changes with "moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls" and an EF of 30%.  The patient was brought to the cath
lab on [**2196-10-7**] where the patient was shown to have three vessel
coronary artery disease with elevated right-sided filling
pressure.  The patient subsequently underwent successful
stenting of the LAD and was brought to the floor.  On the floor,
the patient was monitored on telemetry for 48 hours without
incident.  The patient was without complaints and
hemodynamically stable on discharge to the care of the son where
she will live with the support of the daughter in law.

ESRD: The patient received HD according to her regular schedule
of T, Th and S.

DM: The patient was maintained on her home regimen while on the
floor.  This was not an active issue.
