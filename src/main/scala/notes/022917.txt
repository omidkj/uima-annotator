Date of Birth:  [**2083-2-20**]             Sex:   M

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Meperidine / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2140-3-1**] - Mitral valve repair with a quadrangular resection of
the posterior leaflet and an annuloplasty ring repair with a
30-mm [**Company 1543**] 3-D ring.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 80719**] is a very nice 56-year-old gentleman with a history
of mitral valve prolapse, which has been followed by serial
echocardiograms.  He had been
relatively asymptomatic until [**2139-11-9**] when he began to
experience dyspnea on exertion.  He was admitted to an outside
hospital on [**2139-11-28**], for chest pain where a work up
showed normal coronaries and severe mitral regurgitation.  He
was treated with diuretics at that time, which seemed to not
significantly improve his symptom of dyspnea on exertion.  Due
to severity of his mitral regurgitation, he is now referred for
mitral valve surgery.

Review of his cardiac catheterization from [**Hospital **] Hospital on
[**2139-12-1**], shows his ejection fraction to be 70% with
severe mitral regurgitation, a very dilated left atrium, and no
significant coronary artery disease.  His PA pressure was 30/13
mmHg.  His echocardiogram from [**2139-11-26**] showed an
ejection fraction of 65-70%.  He had left atrial enlargement,
mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation, normal
pulmonary pressures, and a normal left ventricular size.  An
echo from [**2139-2-12**], showed bileaflet mitral valve prolapse
with severe MR.  The regurgitant fraction was calculated to be
71%.


Past Medical History:
mitral valve prolapse, dyslipidemia, hypertension, right bundle
branch block, migraines, anxiety, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, nephrolithiasis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Surgical history is notable for inguinal hernia repairs
bilaterally three times and left shoulder surgery.


Social History:
Currently, he is employed as a superintendent at a waste
treatment center.  He never has smoked.  He uses alcohol very
rarely and he lives with his wife currently in [**Name (NI) 1727**].  His last
dental exam was a week ago.


Family History:
Family history is notable for a father who had had several
cerebrovascular accidents as well as a myocardial infarction and
ultimately passed away at the age of 56.  His family history is
also pretty significant for atrial fibrillation in his parents
and a mother who passed away at the age of 34 of colon cancer.


Physical Exam:
 His pulse is 64 and regular.  Respirations are
14.  His blood pressure on his right is 124/80 and on his left
is
118/80.  He is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 170 pounds.  In
general, he is a well-developed and well-nourished gentleman in
no acute distress.  His skin is warm and dry without clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  His HEENT exam shows him to be
normocephalic
and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
Sclerae are anicteric.  Oropharynx is benign.  His teeth are in
good repair.  His neck is supple with full range of motion and
no
JVD.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart shows
a
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  There is a late
4/6 systolic murmur, which is best heard at the left sternal
border and tracking to the apex.  His abdomen is soft,
nondistended, and nontender with normal active bowel sounds.
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused without edema.  There are no significant varicosities
on
standing.  He does have some mild spider varicosities of his
distal lower extremities.  Pulses are 2+ throughout.
Neurologically, he is alert and oriented x3.  There are no focal
deficits.  His gait is steady and his strength is [**4-12**].  I do not
appreciate a carotid bruit bilaterally.


Pertinent Results:
[**2140-3-1**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.

Annuloplasty ring in mitral position. Well seated and stable.

Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] across mitral valve < 5 mm hg.

LVOT peak [**Last Name (Titles) **] = 18 mm HG.

Transient LVOR [**Last Name (Titles) **] generated with low CBP < 85 mm HG.
Trated with volume and after-load augmentation and heart rate
control < 90 beats/min.

No other change in valve structure and function

[**2140-3-2**] CTA
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.

[**2140-3-3**] Carotid
1. 0% stenosis in the left and right internal carotid arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 80719**] was admitted for elective repair of his mitral valve
on [**2140-3-1**]. He was taken to the operating room where he
underwent a mitral valve repair with a 30mm ring. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. He later awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He had a transient
episode of word finding and confusion for which a neuroloy
consult was obtained. A CT scan and carotid ultrasound were
negative. His symptoms promptly resolved without reoccurence. On
postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down uniit
for further recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted
for asistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He
continued to make steady progress and was dishcarged home on
postoperative day 4 ins stable condition.  He will be
anticoagulated with coumadin for 3 months and it will be
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80724**].
