Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB at OSH, [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80 yo male w/PMH significant for CAD s/p MI in [**2131**] with 4v CABG
and redo in [**2141**], Pacemaker/ICD, DM, HTN, asbestosis on home O2
who experienced sudden SOB after his dinner.  No associated CP.
He did report orthopnea and palpitations.  No fever, chills, or
cough.  He went to [**Hospital3 **] ED and was found to have a BP
of 204/101 and HR of 140 in sinus rhythm, RR=34, and O2 sat of
88% on RA in respiraotry distress.  He was given a heparin drip,
nitroglycerin drip, 40 mg IV Lasix, ASA, nebs, 5 mg Lopressor
x3, SLNTG x3, Morphine, and 125 mg solumedrol.  His BP then
dropped and he was flown to [**Hospital1 18**].  Here, his BP was 75/53, and
his nitro drip was D/Ced.  He was started on dopamine ad his BP
stabilized.  BNP at OSH was >6000, and initial enzymes were
negative.  Given lasix and diuresed 800 cc.  Currently feels
"much better", no CP, but still not at baseline. His anginal
equivalent is SOB, not CP.

Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is severely depressed (ejection fraction approximately 20
percent). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function
appears depressed. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but
cannot be quantified.

Chest CT:
IMPRESSION: 1) Extensive calcified pleural plaques consistent
with prior history of asbestos exposure. Right pleural effusion
with equivocal smooth enhancement of the right posterior lateral
pleural surface but without nodularity or other findings to
suggest mesothelioma. Correlation with pleural aspirate should
be considered.

2) Cardiomegaly and extensive coronary artery calcifications.

3) Borderline enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries suggest
a possible pulmonary artery hypertension.

4) Atelectasis at the left lung base and bronchiectasiss.

5) Extensive calcifications throughout the pancreas consistent
with chronic pancreatitis.

6) Small nodule in the left adrenal gland which possibly
represents an adenoma. However, this cannot be fully
characterized due to the lack of non- contrast series.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1) CHF
2) Calcified pleural plaques with a large right effusion or
pleural thickening. Further evaluation with CT scan is
reccommended to exclude malignant mesothelioma.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 80 y/o male with h/o CAD, DM, HTN, asbestosis was admitted
in fairly stable condition after a modest diuresis at the OSH
and the ED.  He was managed for an NSTEMI and acute CHF
exacerbation.  We spoke with his PCP and pulmonologist while he
was here, and obtained records from his cardiologist.
1.CHF:  This exacerbation was likely due to a combination of
ischemia(NSTEMI), severe HTN, and chronic systolic/diastolic
dysfunction.  We started him on Natrecor due to his underlying
CRI and he diuresed well with daily goals of 1L negative fluid
balance.  Also got an echo which confirmed an EF of approx 20%,
and 2+MR.  His SOB rapidly improved, but he was still using
minimal O2 upon D/C.  He is on 2LNC at home chronically.  He was
able to walk without O2 in the hospital though without dropping
his O2 sats.  Patient was instructed to not eat salty foods and
wife confirmed they have seen nutritionist before and have
handouts at home of appropriate and inappropriate foods.  He was
transitioned to Lasix on D/C at 20 mg/day, with instructions to
weigh himself and take extra Lasix iof his weight increases by 2
lbs in 1 day.  Hopefully this will keep him from slowly entering
CHF again.  He was on Lasix in the past, then Bumex, but for
now, we will try Lasix with the above instructions.  His
cardiologist or PCP may elect to alter this regimen depending on
his stability as an outpatient.
2.CAD:Known h/o coronary issues.  His EKG showed a new
incomplete LBBB and his cardiac enzymes were positive for MI.
No ST elevations seen.  His anginal equivalent is also SOB,
which was his primary complaint.  Initially started on ASA,
heparin, statin.  His Coreg was held due to initially tenuous
BP.  He was briefly on dopamine, but was quickly weaned from
this.  His CKs peaked in 200s and began trending down.  There
was question of whether this was resu
