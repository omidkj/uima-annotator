Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
leg weakness, back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracic laminectomies and fusion


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] is an 81 year old woman with history of multiple
myeloma, chronic renal insufficiency, T10-T11 lesion with cord
compression, admitted from nursing home for elective surgery.
.
She was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] in [**2180**] for pneumonia. She then
developed significant back pain. X-rays and MRI revealed a
pathological fracture of her thoracic spine, given TLSO and
after serial MRIs showed worsening fracture.
.
Multiple Myeloma diagnosis was made in [**2178**], treated with
radiotherapy, but noted in the past month to have progressive
neurologic decline with lower extremity weakness and difficulty
with walking. MRI showed T10-T11 lesion with severe fracture and
anterior wedging with near collapse of T11, resulting in cord
compression. Patient did not tolerate TLSO brace well, and lower
extremity weakness progressed to significantly decreased
proximal muscle strength with some decreased distal strength as
well. Spinal cord edema was noted on repeat MRI, and patient was
started on dexamethasone. She was taken to the OR on [**2182-2-18**] for
laminectomy. Patient had wanted to wait until results of recent
bone marrow biopsy on [**2182-2-15**] to have surgery.
.
Patient was treated with Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] x5 days, starting on
[**2182-2-3**]. Urine culture showed E. Coli >100,000 which was
resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin; cultures were sensitive to bactrim, ceftazidime,
cefepime, gentamicin.

         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain

symptomatic
         (relapse).

IMAGING:

MRI of thoracic spine [**2182-1-16**]:
Significant for T10 and T11 fractures with cord compression at
these levels and cord edema.

Lumbar Spine [**2182-2-19**]:
FINDINGS/IMPRESSION: Two [**Location (un) 931**] rods were placed, bilateral
pedicle screws are in the L1, T12, T10, T9 vertebral bodies.
There are laminal hooks in T8 level. Again note is made of a
marked compression deformity of T11 and compression fracture of
T10. Intervertebral disc space is obliterated. Posterior skin
staples are seen. There is a right internal jugular catheter and
a right-sided Port-A-Cath through the right internal jugular as
well. The location of tip of the catheter has not changed, and
compared to the most recent prior radiographs. Incidentally
noted are cholecystectomy clips.

CT Ab/Pelvix [**2-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Small amount of
free simple
fluid in the pelvis.
2. Left and right colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

3. Extensive vascular calcifications.
4. Surgical absence of gallbladder.
5. No abnormal fluid collections,
intraperitoneal/retroperitoneal free air, or upper abdominal
ascites.
6. Post posterior spinal fusion with advanced degenerative
changes as above.
7. Fluid distended distal esophagus. [**Month (only) 116**] represent dysmotiliy,
reflux, or
mechanial process. Clinical correlation would be useful and
endoscopy can be performed if necessary.

CXR [**2-24**]: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right sided port and left
internal jugular
central venous line are in unchanged position without
pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is mild vascular
congestion and
a newly apparent right basilar opacity mildly obscuring the
right
hemidiaphragm. This could represent a combination of pleural
fluid and
atelectasis, although consolidation is not excluded. There is a
small left
effusion/atelectasis and linear atelectasis in the lingula.
