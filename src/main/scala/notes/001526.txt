None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111187**] is a 59 yar old man with a PMH significant for ARF x
5, GIB, and cholestatic jaundice during his last admit who was
discharged 9 days prior to admission. He was in his usual state
of health until about 3 days prior to arrival when he developed
the onset of a headache, nausea, dry heaves. This is how he
feels when he has renal failure. He also noted increasing pedal
edema and thirst. He denies hematochezia, fevers, chills,
diarrhea, chest pain, dysuria, or hematuria. He says that his
sugars have been excellent lately. He has not taken lasix since
his last admit. He states that he last took 2 tablets of alieve
2 nights ago.

In the ED, he was found to be in acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 5.2 up from 1.6 six days ago. LENIS were negative
for DVT.

.
CXR: bilateral effusions consistent with pulmonary edema (my
interpretation)
.
LENI negative but limited by habitus
.
U/S [**10-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Sludge-filled gallbladder without evidence for cholecystitis.
Common duct dilatation to 2 cm, etiology indeterminate.
2. Normal patency of the hepatic and portal venous vasculature.
3. Fatty liver.
4. Small ascites.
.
ECHO [**10-18**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70 percent). No
masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mitral
regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but
cannot be quantified. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**10-19**] U/S with dopplers
IMPRESSION:
1. Extremely limited study due to patient body habitus.
2. Distended gallbladder with sludge.
3. Fatty liver. Main and right portal veins are patent.
4. Increased ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Oliguric Renal Failure:  Initially patient was thought to be
prerenal vs HRS, and FENA was consistent with this.  The patient
was hydrated with NaHCO, cautiously, and was started on
hepotorenal medications including octreotide, midodrine, and
albumin.  Urine output transiently increased, but unclear if
this was d/t hydration or HRS treatment, as both occurred
simultaneously.  Additionally, foley was found to be in urethra
on HD #2 and once this was replaced, urine output increased
transiently.  However, the patient continued to have poor urine
output even in the setting of adequate BP.  CVVH was started in
setting of uremia.  Repeat FENA suggested ATN, but it was
questionable how accurate this was in the setting of CVVH.
There was some concern for right ventricular dysfunction in the
face of pulmonary hypertension, and an ECHO was performed.  This
showed mod pulm HTN based on TR gradient of 45, but right
ventricle was not well visualized d/t patient's habitus.  CXR
demonstrated a widened mediastinum that was concerning for
congestion.  Because the patient's fluid status was not
completely clear and because there was some concern for hepatic
congestion by renal and total body fluid overload, 50cc/hr was
removed with CVVH.  Cr intermittently trended down with CVVH but
then trended upwards.  Treatment for HRS was continued, but
patient was unable to get midodrine for ~1day as he was
aspirating meds and it was very difficult to pass an NGT.
Patient remained oliguric until death.
.
# Transaminitis: Pt had evidence of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis and presumed drug injury on previous biopsy and
demonstrated continued worsening of synthetic funtion based upon
INR and bilirubin.  No clear etiology of acute liver
decompensation was found.  Liver U/S from [**10-17**] showed no
thrombosis of portal or hepatic veins and little ascites, and
this was repeated with no change.  There may have been a small
element of hepatic congestion, but this was not the cause of the
acute decompensation as the LFT's would have been more elevated.
 Although the patient had already had a full workup for acute
liver disease, repeat workup was performed with CMV, EBV, and
Hep serologies, all of which were negative.  No cause for acute
liver decompensation was determined, and the patient became
progressively more encephalopathic.  He was treated with
lactulose for encephalopathy, but did not receive this for ~1
day d/t poor PO access.  An arterial ammonia level was obtained
and was moderately elevated
.
# Septicemia - The patient did not have fevers or a white count
on presentation or for the majority of his ICU stay.  Because
his mental status was deteriorating and white count jumped up,
blood cultures were taken on [**10-19**] which showed GPC in clusters,
which later grew out coagulase negative staph, and broad
spectrum antibiotics were started.  However, over the course of
the following day he rapidly became hypotensive, febrile, and
tachycardic.  He was found to by hypoxic with PaO2 78 and
adidemic with pH 7.1 and was intubated.  His lactate trended
from 1.4 to 11.4 within 16 hours, and his hypotension progressed
to the point or requiring 3 different pressors to maintain MAPs.
 A discussion was held with his wife and she made him [**Name (NI) 3225**] in the
