History of Present Illness:
71F followed by a nephrologist over the past year for
hypertension difficult to manage despite being on metoprolol,
hydralazine, clonidine, and furosemide.  She has had two renal
artery duplex ultrasounds, most recently in [**2200-11-11**], which
showed progressive bilateral renal artery stenosis, with the
right particularly worse (90% stenosed) than the left.  She
presents today for renal artery angiogram and possible stenting.

ROS positive for possible sequelae of renal artery stenosis: two
episodes of CHF exacerbations in [**2200-11-11**], each managed
with hospitalization and diuresis.

She was admitted to the Vasular Surgery service and was given
intravenous hydration with bicarbonate.  She was taken to the
endovascular suite for renal angiogram and stenting.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 35307**] was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on
[**2200-12-29**].  She was given IV hydration with bicarbonate and
kept NPO.  She was taken to the endovascular suite on [**2200-12-29**]
for renal artery angiogram.  The surgeon was Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**].
 Please see the operative note for greater detail.  The renal
arteries proved hard to selectively canalize and therefore she
was not stented in that session.  In addition, she was having
progressively difficult to manage hypertension with systolic
pressures greater than 200s requiring nitro drip and worsening
nausea.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable
condition, where she was monitored overnight.  She was
hypertensive overnight requiring labetalol drip and occasional
hydralazine IV.  NGT was placed for vomiting.  Urine output
dropped so the patient was given several boluses of saline.
Serum creatinine increased from 1.6 pre-operatively to 2.4.  She
also had some agitation and was given haldol and ativan.  On
[**12-30**], she was transferred to the ICU for additional monitoring.
 Given oxygen requirement and decreasing urine output, 260 mg of
lasix was given without notable increase in urine output, but
creatinine continued to rise.  Temporary hemodialysis line was
placed in the right IJ and the patient received CVVH. In
addition to labetalol drip, hydralazine and metoprolol were used
for blood pressure control, and clonidine was started at 0.1 mg
PO TID. On [**2200-12-31**] the patient received hemodialysis again,
before which her creatinine had risen to 4.8.  Labetalol drip
was switched to nicardipine.  NGT was removed.  Urine output was
minimal throughout the day.  On [**2201-1-1**] the patient was taken
to the endovascular suite for bilateral renal artery angiogram
and stenting.  The surgeons were Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**].  Both renal arteries were angioplastied and
stents placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Urine
production resumed immediately after the procedure.  She was
subsequently taken to the ICU for post-operative monitoring.
She received minimal hemodialysis.  Her blood pressure control
improved, and she was able to be weaned off of a nicardipine
drip.  Blood pressure was maintained on metoprolol, hydralazine,
and clonidine.  Home blood pressure regimen was restarted on
[**2201-1-2**] and decreased as the patient tolerated, given that
her blood pressure remained well-controlled with systolic blood
pressure less than 150.  The patient produced 2 liters of urine.
 Hematocrit had trended down to 24.7, and given patient's
cardiac history she was transfused with one unit of packed red
blood cells.  Her hematocrit increased appropriately.

On [**2201-1-3**], he patient was ambulating independently.  Her
foley catheter was discontinued and she was able to void.  Her
creatinine had trended down to 2.1.  Her hemodialysis line was
removed from her neck without bleeding or swelling.  The arm and
groin access sites were clean, dry, intact, without evidence of
bleeding or swelling.  She was tolerating a regular diet.  Pain
was well-controlled.  The patient was felt to be stable for
discharge to home with appropriate followup with her
nephrologist and primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] outpatient lab
measurements of her electrolytes on [**2201-1-5**].  She understood
this plan and was in agreement.
