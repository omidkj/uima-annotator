Service:  MEDICINE-[**Hospital1 **] FIRM.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
female with the past medical history of type 2 diabetes
mellitus and osteoporosis.  Two years ago she had a CT of the
chest and abdomen showing liver metastasis and lung lesions.
She declined further workup.  She has been bedridden for the
past two years after a number of falls during which time she
injured her lower extremities.  She presented to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital with hematemesis on [**2129-5-29**].   EGD showed a
grade 3 esophageal varices, not bleeding, therefore, no
therapy was done.  After being transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] the patient re-bled, had a second
endoscopy.  According to the report, the bleeding was perfuse
and could not be treated endoscopically, therefore, the
patient was intubated with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube placed.  The
patient bled with hematocrit dropping from 40% to 18%.  She
received 74 units of packed red blood cells and two units of
fresh frozen plasma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the
following:  VITAL SIGNS:  140/60 blood pressure, pulse 86.
General appearance:  The patient is an obese, sedated,
paralyzed female.  SKIN:  No jaundice.  She has palmar
erythema.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  No scleral icterus, no jaundice.
RESPIRATORY:  Lungs were clear anteriorly.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
The patient had irregularly irregular heart rate with no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops, distant heart sounds.  ABDOMEN:
Examination revealed the patient to be obese, distended,
without hepatomegaly, with marked splenomegaly and decreased
bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  1+ edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count of 9.2, hematocrit 40.9, platelet count 209,000,
sodium 130, potassium 4.2, chloride 104, BUN 25, creatinine
0.5, glucose 248, magnesium 1.7, calcium 7.9, phosphorus 3.5,
bilirubin 1.5, AST 33, ALT 19, alkaline phosphatase 118,
albumin 3.0, amylase 31, total protein 6.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course was subsequently
complicated by pneumonia requiring tracheal intubation and
treated with Oxicillin.  The patient has mental status
changes, which were thought to be secondary to
encephalopathy.  The patient was diagnosed with cirrhosis of
unknown origin.  Hepatitis serologies returned negative.  The
[**Doctor First Name **] workup, rheumatologic workup returned negative.  The
ammonia level remained normal despite her mental status
changes.  The CT examination of the head showed chronic mild
atrophy with chronic vascular microinfarction.  Therefore, at
discharge, the patient's main issues were history of
cirrhosis, status post esophageal bleed, status post
encephalopathy, and status post pneumonia and intubation.
She also had a history of nonsmall cell lung cancer, which
was not treated for the past two years.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient is to followup with a repeat
endoscopy in 30 days.  She has been advised by speech and
swallow to eat pureed foods and thick liquids.

PULMONARY:  The patient has been weaned off oxygen.  She is
actively using incentive spirometry and increased upper body
activity to decrease atelectasis.

RENAL:  The patient is being aggressively diuresed with 40 mg
PO b.i.d. Lasix to decrease the ascites and swelling in her
lower extremities.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

The patient is being discharged to a nursing home on the
