History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 28082**] is a 45 year old female with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis who presented to an OSH with a chief complaint of 1
week duration of SOB and productive cough for the past 2 days.
She was found to have a temp of 102, tachy to 120, BP stable
120/80. O2 sat 84% on RA, 95% on 2 liters with severe orthopnea.
She was found to have a large R pleural effusion and given
azithro, ceftriaxone and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
she was found to be profoundly hypoxic (7.43/30/56 on 100%
FiO2), and RR of 40+ and in acute resp distress and therefore
she was intubated. In addition she was started on hydrocort and
fludricort and sent to the ICU.

Imaging:
CT CHEST  [**1-22**]:
1. Diffuse bilateral ground glass and consolidative opacities
within both lungs consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
2. Large right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis of
the right middle and right lower lobes.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Findings compatible with cirrhosis and moderate amount of
ascites.
5. Stranding and soft tissue density adjacent to the right
internal jugular vein consistent with a small hematoma from
recent central venous attempt. No pneumothorax.
CT HEAD [**1-22**]:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
ABD U/S [**2-2**]:
Directed son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination over the four abdominal
quadrants
demonstrates a small amount of ascites which is insufficient for
both marking a spot for tap and ultrasound-guided paracentesis.
There is a large right pleural effusion.
CT HEAD [**2-2**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CXRs showed persistent right sided opacities.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2107-3-17**] 10:29 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged large amount of ascites and soft tissue anasarca.
3. Increased amount of air within the bladder. The patient does
have a Foley in place.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-3-14**] 8:09 AM
CHEST AP: Motion artifact is present. Tracheostomy tube is in
place. An NG tube is seen with its tip below the diaphragm.
There is a persistent loculated right pleural effusion.
Multifocal opacities are present in the right lung, unchanged
from the previous study. There is some interval clearing of the
left lung opacities.

IMPRESSION: Persistent right lung airspace opacities with a
loculated right effusion. Improving left lower lobe opacity.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2107-3-11**] 1:05 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right pleural effusion causing contralateral
mediastinal shift. Multiple opacities in the lungs consistent
with ARDS.
2. Ascites, pericardial effusion, and soft tissue anasarca.
3. No evidence for abscess.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US PORT RIGHT  [**2107-3-3**] 5:11 PM
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the
right subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins. There
is evidence of filling defect within a right brachial/axillary
vein. However, when compared to prior study, the subclavian vein
now demonstrates wall-to-wall flow on Doppler study. Compression
of the subclavian was difficult to assess secondary to the
clavicle. Right cephalic vein now demonstrate compressibility
and wall-to-wall Doppler flow with normal waveforms. Internal
jugular was not assessed secondary to patient's tracheostomy and
overlying equipment.

IMPRESSION: Again seen is evidence of deep venous thrombus
within the right brachial/axillary vein. Flow now seen within
the cephalic and subclavian veins.
