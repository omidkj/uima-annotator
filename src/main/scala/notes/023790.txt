CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 73-year-old male with a
known history of aortic stenosis, presenting with increased
dyspnea on exertion.

HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
male with a known history of aortic stenosis, who reports an
increase in dyspnea on exertion following bilateral hip
replacements in [**12-4**] and [**5-5**].  The patient reported that
his symptoms initially limited his ambulation to 25 feet, but
is now improved to 50 to 75 feet.  The patient denied any
chest pains during the symptoms.  The patient did have some
episodes of head feeling funny, but denied any actual
dizziness or syncope.  The patient had been admitted to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital approximately a month and a half before his
admission to [**Hospital1 69**], with
shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.  At that time,
he was found to be anemic, with a hematocrit of 27, and
required transfusions.  An echocardiogram was performed at
that time, which revealed aortic stenosis with a valve area
of .6 cm.sq., peak gradient of 66 mm Hg, and a mean gradient
of 40 mm Hg.  The study also showed that the patient had
inferior hypokinesis, consistent with a prior infarct, and an
ejection fraction of 505.  The patient underwent an endoscopy
to evaluate the source of his anemia.  He was found to have
erosions in his stomach, duodenum and esophagus, which were
thought to account for his anemia.  The patient has since
been treated with Prevacid and iron, with improvement in his
hematocrit.  The patient was also discharged on lasix and has
diuresed well.  The patient had a repeat echocardiogram at
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**2163-10-27**], which
revealed an aortic valve area of .9 cm.sq., peak gradient of
50 mm Hg, and a mean gradient of 30 mm Hg.  He was at that
time seen by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], and scheduled for an aortic
valve repair on [**2163-11-8**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2163-11-7**] and underwent a cardiac
catheterization.  He was found to have three vessel disease,
and the decision was made to perform a coronary artery bypass
graft along with aortic valve repair.  The patient was taken
to the operating room on [**2163-11-8**].

Following the surgery, the patient was noted to be in
complete heart block.  The patient was ultimately scheduled
for a pacemaker placement on postoperative day number seven,
when his conduction system failed to resume functioning.
While in the CSRU, the patient complained on postoperative
day number five of some burning on urination.  A urinalysis
and cultures sent returned positive, and the patient was
started on ciprofloxacin and Pyridium, with improvement in
his symptoms.

On postoperative day number six, the patient was also noted
to develop atrial fibrillation and was therefore started on
heparin.  The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery floor on postoperative day number seven, following
the placement of his pacemaker.  The patient's recovery on
the floor proceeded uneventfully thereafter.  The patient was
started on Coumadin, with the intention of completing a six
week course of the medication.  The patient was also started
on amiodarone when it was noted that he continued to have
some underlying atrial fibrillation in spite of the pacing.

The patient was deemed stable for discharge on postoperative
day number ten/three.  At that time, the patient's pain was
well controlled.  He was tolerating his diet and sessions
with Physical Therapy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

approximately four weeks following discharge.  The patient is
also to follow up with Electrophysiology following discharge.
He has an appointment at the Device Clinic on [**2163-11-22**].  The
patient will also need to follow up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is expected to
