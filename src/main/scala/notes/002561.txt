LABORATORY DATA:  On admission WBC was 4.8, hematocrit 39.1,

15, 1.2, 111.

Chest x-ray from [**2138-3-8**], demonstrated no acute CP
processes. EKG from [**2138-3-8**], was normal sinus
rhythm at 65, no ST/T wave changes. Echocardiogram
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 60%. CT of the abdomen
and pelvis demonstrated cirrhosis, positive splenomegaly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2138-3-15**], the patient was
admitted for possible liver transplant surgery. The patient
was prepped preoperatively with routine medications prior to
admission for liver transplant surgery.

The patient went to the OR on [**2138-3-15**], where an
orthotopic liver transplant with a duct-a-duct biliary
reconstruction was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 816**].
Two drains were placed; 1 drain was placed in the portal
space and another behind the liver. The abdomen was closed.
The skin was closed with staples. The patient was stable and
went to the ICU postoperatively. Please see the operative
note from [**2138-3-15**], for more details.

On postoperative day 1, the patient had a liver ultrasound
demonstrating patent portal and hepatic veins, main hepatic
artery was seen. The left and right branches were not
visualized on this technically limited study. A short
interval followup is recommended.

Labs on [**2138-3-16**], revealed a WBC of 10.3, hematocrit
29.4, platelets 119; sodium 145, 3.8, 102, 16, BUN and
creatinine of 19 and 1.1, glucose 217; LFTs included an ALT
of 786, AST 2072, alkaline phosphatase 88, amylase 59, total
bilirubin 5.3.

The patient was intubated and was receiving morphine for pain
management. He was weaned off the ventilator. He received
Unasyn, Bactrim, fluconazole and ganciclovir.

A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2138-3-17**], due to a
slow wean off the ventilator. The bronchoscopy revealed that
the patient had right lower lobe pneumonia. Cultures were
sent, and cultures reported that the patient Pseudomonas
aeruginosa from the bronchioalveolar lavage.

The patient received Lasix for continued diuresis. The
patient was placed on Bactrim, Zosyn, vancomycin and
fluconazole. The Zosyn and vancomycin was for the pneumonia.

Ultrasound was performed on [**2138-3-18**], to the liver
demonstrating the patent hepatic vasculature. On [**2138-3-18**], the patient was still intubated on assist-control. The
patient received diuresis. He was continued on antibiotics.
He was afebrile and bradycardiac.

The ET tube was changed over a catheter for incompetent
balloon. The patient was given multiple units of blood
products.

On [**2138-3-19**], tube feeds were started. Antibiotics
were changed, and levofloxacin was added for Pseudomonas. The
patient was intubated and sedate. Pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light. Lungs were coarse bilaterally. Abdomen
was soft. There was 1+ edema of the lower extremities. The
dressing was clean, dry and intact.

On [**2138-3-19**], his weight was slowly dropping. Labs
that day demonstrated a WBC of 2.7, hematocrit 31.5, platelet
count 36, sodium 142, 4.2, 102, 31, BUN and creatinine of 43
and 1.3, glucose 115. His AST decreased significantly to 800,
ALT 1603, alkaline phosphatase 82. Total bilirubin was 8.2.
INR was 1.8.

FK was started on [**2138-3-17**], and was slowly increased
in dose. On [**2138-3-19**], the patient had chest x-ray to
evaluate his pneumonia and ET tube manipulation demonstrating
that the right perihilar consolidation or edema is clearing
with lung essentially clear. No pleural effusions. Heart
normal size. Mediastinum is midline.

The patient was extubated and doing well. He was transferred
to the floor on [**2138-3-20**]. There the patient was
afebrile, vital signs stable, good input and output. Two JPs
with good output. The patient received physical therapy. Diet
was advanced.

On [**2138-3-22**], the patient had another chest x-ray
since the patient needed increase O2 requirement. The
impression stated that there was continued improvement of the
right infrahilar opacity. There were no signs of pleural
effusion, focal infiltrates or evidence of overt pulmonary
edema.

Since being on the floor, the patient has required from 2-4 L
of oxygen to keep an O2 saturation of 94%, but no exertional
shortness of breath witnessed.

The patient continued with physical therapy, Lasix, pulmonary
toilet and incentive spirometer. He was doing well. He was
walking around. He was voiding. He was eating well.

On [**2138-3-23**], on postoperative day 7, the patient
continued on fluconazole and Levaquin. The second JP drain
was removed. The patient continued on MMF, prednisone and FK.
Central line was removed on the 26th.

The patient was screened for rehab. On postoperative day 9,
the patient required a little bit more pain medication.
Dilaudid was increased to every q.3-4 hours. He was afebrile
with vital signs stable. Fingersticks have been relatively
high in the 200-300s. The patient has been on 2 L at 95% O2.
He had good input/output. He had bibasilar rales but non-
labored.

The patient otherwise is doing well status post liver
transplant complicated by Pseudomonal pneumonia, but the
patient is receiving pulmonary toilet. He is to have
levofloxacin x 10 days. The patient did receive chest x-ray
on [**2138-3-25**], demonstrating no significant interval
change in the lung parenchyma, no signs of pleural effusion
or overt pulmonary edema.

Physical therapy felt that the patient should go to rehab. A
bed is available on [**2138-3-25**]. The patient may be
going to rehab soon.
