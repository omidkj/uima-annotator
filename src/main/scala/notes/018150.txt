History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 67yo F w/ a PMH of CHF, HTN, CRI and COPD who was
found at her [**Hospital1 1501**] to be acutely SOB this AM. On exam, she was
found to be wheezing, her O2 sats were 66% and only improved to
72% on 3L. Rest of her VS were: temp of 96.3, BP was 200/80, HR
124, and RR 24. Pt states that she was trying to go to the
bathroom when she became acutely SOB. Per documentation, she had
had a large amount of loose stool at the time (she is
incontinent of both stool and urine at baseline). Denies any CP,
palp, dizziness, LH, arm or jaw pain, diaphoresis, nausea or
vomiting. EMS was called and on arrival, applied a NRB with
improvement in her sats to 99%. On arrival to the ER, her SBP
was still elevated in the 210s and her HR was 110s. She was felt
to have [**1-14**] word dyspnea. Labs and blood cx were sent. She was
given nitropaste w/o effect. She was started on CPAP and was
given IV lasix. Lactate returned at 4.9 and she was given CTX,
azithromycin, and vancomycin. BNP returned at 31,089. CXR was
c/w pulmonary edema. Her SBP remained in the 190s-200s, so a
nitro gtt was started with improvement in her SBP to the 170s.
After 2 hrs, CPAP was discontinued and the patient was able to
maintain her O2 sats of 98-100% on 3L by nc. In total, she made
650cc of UOP. She was transferred to the ICU from the ED once
her respiratory status was stable, as she was still on a
nitroglycerin gtt.
.
ROS: denies fevers, chills, CP, palp, jaw or arm pain,
dizziness, LH, n/v, + mild abd pain, ? diarrhea (pt denies, but
likely per [**Hospital1 1501**] report); denies dysuria or hematuria but pt
incontinent; denies URI sx; denies LE edema, orthopnea or PND;
denies recent use of O2

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67yo F w/ a PMH of CHF, HTN, CRI and COPD who was found at
her [**Hospital1 1501**] to be acutely SOB this AM, likely due to flash pulmonary
edema.
.
# CHF: Patient was admitted with shortness of breath and
pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive crisis.  The
etiology of her pulmonary edema was unclear but was felt to be
secondary to her high blood pressure.  She received lasix and
BiPAP in the ER and was transferred to the MICU.  Upon arrival
to the MICU she was no longer significantly short of breath and
was satting well on 3 L nasal cannula.  She was placed on a
nitroglycerine drip for immediate control of her blood pressure
and was slowly started back on her home antihypertensive
medications.  She was noted to have a slightly elevated troponin
which peaked at 0.22 but she did not complain of any chest pain
and had no EKG changes.  She was quickly weaned off of
supplemental oxygen.  Her chest xray on discharge showed
interval improvement in her pulmonary edema.  A number of
changes were made to her medication regimen.  Her hydralazine
was switched from a TID dosing to a QID dosing.  Her lisinopril
was decreased from 10 mg TID to 10 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Her lasix was
increased to 40 mg PO daily from 40 mg PO every other day.  She
was tolerating this medication regimen well on discharge with
blood pressures ranging from 130s to 140s systolic.
.
# Hypertensive Emergency: On admission the patient was noted to
have a systolic blood pressure in the 200s with evidence of a
mild troponin elevation and CHF consistent with hypertensive
emergency.  Her renal function was at her baseline and she had
no evidence of encephalopathy.  She was started on a
nitroglycerine drip and her outpatient hypertensive regimen was
altered as described above.  Her blood pressure was stable on
this regimen for the remainder of her hospital course.
.
# Elevated Lactate:  On admission the patient was noted to have
a lactate of 4.9 with evidence of an anion gap metabolic
acidosis.  It was thought that this was likely due to
hypoperfusion in the setting of hypertensive crisis.  Following
intervention to decrease her blood pressure this decreased to
1.7.
.
# COPD: The patient has a history of COPD.  On admission she had
no evidence of COPD exacerbation.  She was written for nebulizer
treatments PRN but did not require these.
.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a baseline
creatinine of 2.3 which was her creatinine on presentation.  Her
medications were renally dosed for decreased GFR.
.
# Diabetes:  The patient has a history of type II diabetes for
which she takes oral hypoglycemics.  During her MICU course she
was maintained on an insulin sliding scale with good control of
her blood sugars.  She was discharged on her home diabetes
regimen.
.
# Prophylaxis: She received subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
