43F with history of IPF, COPD/Asthma (multiple admissions and
intubation x1), current smoking, Schizoaffective Disorder and
Depression who was originally admitted to the general medicine
floor on [**2169-4-5**] with fevers, URI symptoms and dyspnea. She was
started on levofloxacin for atypical pneumonia and nebulizers
(peak flow 250, BL 350). On the floor, the patient was given
corticosteroids, albuterol and atrovent nebs, fluticasone and
continued on levofloxacin (given a penicillin allergy). Her
oxygen saturations ranged 89-98% and it was thought that she was
generally improving. Alas, she took a turn for the worse as she
had desaturation to high 80s thought [**2-15**] mucous plugging. She
was noted to have hypercarbia on ABG (7.40/54/71). [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team
evaluated the patient and encouraged increased frequency of nebs
with frequent evals by Respiratory Therapy. She did well until
that  evening when she was found to be somnolent and difficult
to arouse. Her oxygen saturation was in the high 90s. An ABG
revealed 7.39/58/72. Nursing was concerned and the patient was
transferred to unit for closer monitoring. While in the unit,
she was noted to have a combined respiratory acidosis and
metabolic alkalosis.  She was started on BiPAP and gradually
weaned down.  She was transferred to the floor for further
management of her pulmonary disease.  By [**2169-4-15**] the patient
was feeling much better with stable SpO2 >94% on 2L oxygen, and
dramatically improved peak flow >300 and minimal wheezing on
exam.

The patient was stable for discharge on [**2169-4-16**], with minimal
wheezing.  She has home O2 set up from previous use, and will be
discharged with home services.

During [**2169-4-15**] patient had elevated FBS readings 200-300.  She
was initiated on a glargine / humalog insulin regimen, with 15
units glargine qPM giving improved control.  She will go home
with this regimen (glargine + humalog sliding scale tid), and
understands that this will need to be adjusted as she
discontinues her steroid medication.

Ms. [**Known lastname 5923**] will receive a slow prednisone taper over one week,
and follow up with her primary care physician and pulmonology.
