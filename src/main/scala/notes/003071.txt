CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Coffee ground emesis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87 year old man with
a history of ETOH abuse, significant for drinking six or
seven scotches per night, history of dilated cardiomyopathy,
ejection fraction of 30 percent.  He awoke two nights prior
to admission, had four episodes of brownish ground coffee
emesis.  The patient was admitted on [**2197-6-23**].  No complaints
of abdominal pain or retching.  He also noted bright red
blood, some dizziness, no shortness of breath and no
weakness.  He went to his primary care physician who sent the
patient to the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency
Department, he had two more episodes of coffee ground emesis.
Nasogastric lavage attempted but it was aborted secondary to
a nosebleed.  The patient's hematocrit had dropped from 44.0
percent to 35.0 percent.  The patient was therefore admitted
to the unit for evaluation of upper gastrointestinal bleed.

patient was treated with Protonix and discharged home on p.o.
Protonix with follow-up with his primary care physician in
one to two weeks with plans for referral for an outpatient
esophagogastroduodenoscopy for biopsies to confirm the visual
appearance of Barrett's esophagitis.  The patient is to
follow-up in six to eight weeks.
