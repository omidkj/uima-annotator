History of Present Illness:
75-year-old gentleman with chief complaint of acute shortness of
breath with worsening COPD, possibly pulmonary edema coming from
[**Hospital3 537**] Rehab.  Pt with end stage COPD recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital until [**2146-1-30**] where he was
placed on large doses of Prednisone and Roxanol and had agreed
to palliative. He improved after several days at the rehab and
changed his mind regarding palliative care and requested full
code status with full treatment including intubation if
necessary. This AM he developed severe shortness of breath, not
relived with Roxanol nebulizers and Prednisone.  He can not

CT CHEST [**2146-3-11**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Slowly resolving right upper lobe lipoid pneumonia.
2. Slightly changing pattern of bibasilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] and
nodularity, but
with persistent bronchial wall thickening, compatible with
chronic aspiration.
3. Severe bullous emphysema with upper lobe predominance,
unchanged.
4. Sub-6-mm nodules, with no definite evidence of interval
growth since
[**2143-12-11**]. No followup is required for the nodules.
5. Tracheostomy tube and gastric tube in standard positions;
secretions
pooling above the tracheostomy cuff may be contributing to
chronic aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for severe COPD
admitted for Influenza complicated by MRSA/Pseudomonas pneumonia
and failure to wean from vent now s/p trach and PEG.

# Goals of care: Family meeting held with patient's family, with
decision to be made DNR with bridge to Hospice.

#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This was likely due to a
COPD exacerbation in the setting of influenza infection and
superimposed MRSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia. He was treated with
a steroid taper and Tamiflu for 10 days. He also received a
course of antibiotics for his pneumonia. He was initially
covered with Vanc, Cefepime and Cipro, and was narrowed to Vanc
and Cipro based on sensitivities. He was extubated on [**2146-2-19**]
and reintubated after he had increased work of breathing,
hypertension, and tachypnea causing a decrease in sats and
increased hypercarbia. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] ICU on [**2146-3-7**] after it appeared he would not be easily
weaned from the ventillator for placement of trach and PEG tube.
However, he was unable to be weaned to trach mask (repeatedly
developed tachypnea and felt extreme dyspnea/distress) so
remained ventillated throughout his stay. On [**2146-3-14**] a family
meeting was held with two of his daughters (including
[**Name (NI) **], his health care proxy) to discuss goals of care. It
was decided that he should be transferred to an LTAC facility at
this time.

During his [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU stay, his total body fluid balance
grew close to 6L positive. He received diuresis with IV lasix in
an effort to optimize respiratory status, though significant
pulmonary edema was not noted on his chest imaging. He was
discharged on 80 mg PO lasix daily with goal of maintaining
euvolemia.

Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] [**Last Name (Titles) 78297**] developed episodes of respiratory
distress associated with significant agitation and discomfort.
He generally responde
