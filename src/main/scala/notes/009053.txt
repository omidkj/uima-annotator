Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
hpi: 88 yo male with pmhx significant for alzheimer's, a-fib,
htn, who presented to ED today with altered mental status,
lethargy x 3 days. In [**Name (NI) **], pt found to have [**Name (NI) 7792**] w/ troponin
elevation to 1.18, CK of 388. Cards was consulted, decision made
that patient not cath candidate and would be medically managed.
Pt also found to have RLL pneumonia on CXR, given
Vanc/deftriaxone/azithromycin. Received 2 liter IVF. On arrival
to the floor, pt found to have oxygen saturation of 74 on 4L
NC--> up to 99% on NRB. Pt also became tachycardic and
hypotensive with systolic to 80's. Received 5mg IV lopressor
which brought heart rate down to low 100's and improved BP to
120's systolic. Pt remained tachypneic, hypoxic, and lethargic.
ABG done--> 7.24/73/352 on NRB. Patient is russian-speaking
only, but denies any chest pain. Family had decided earlier for
patient to be DNR/DNI, were notified that patient is requiring
transfer to ICU, will be coming together to discuss further
goals of care. Pt transferred to ICU for continuous oxygen
monitoring.
.
Per granddaughter who is HCP, patient resident at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
for the past 3.5 years. At baseline, is wheelchair bound,
responds poorly to questions, able to feed himself on pureed
diet. Granddaughter was notified by NH that pt had been
increaingly lethargic and dyspneic since Friday, felt to have
aspiration PNA. Decision was made to hospitalize him, but does
not want agressive measures including intubations, CVL, or other
invasive procedures.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Aspiration pneumonia- Patient with CXR c/w aspiration
pneumonia coupled with failure of swallow study.  Given this
coupled with hypoxia and leukocytosis, asp pna most likely.
Therefore the patient was started on
vancomycin/levo/metronidazole.  As levofloxacin has SE of
causing AMS in elderly it was changed to cefepime based on ID
recommendations.  The patient had improvement of hypoxia and was
able to be weaned to nasal cannula.  Other contributors to the
hypoxia include flash pulm edema and PE though those were less
likely given the patient's ABG and improvement on abx. Was given
diuresis while in ICU. Upon transfer to floor, pt was sating mid
90s on 2L NC; however remained tachypneic with RR in 30s.
Evaluated by speech and swallow who could not make
recommendations regarding pt's nutrition as pt did not cooperate
in participating in video swallow study.  Continued on
Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl for aspiration pna (vanc for h/o MRSA in
sputum). Noted to have WBC jump from 10 to 16 while on floor.
Not further worked up as family decided to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**],  d/c'd
antibiotics, all blood draws, and IVFs. Pt passed within 48 hrs
of being made [**Name (NI) 3225**].
.
2) Hypotension - Occasionally became occasionally hypotensive
and responded to small fluid boluses. Hypotension thought to be
[**1-26**] infection, possible element of cardiogenic shock. Family did
not wish for invasive procedures including CVLs and pressors.
.
3) [**Name (NI) 7792**] - Pt with [**Name (NI) 7792**] by enzymes and EKG changes,
cardiology consulted who felt that pt was not good candidate for
cath and opted for medical management. Was on heparin gtt, which
was d/c'd in ICU as felt that risks outweighed benefits at this
time. Was on ASA and statin which were subsequently held during
hospital course as pt did not pass initial speech and swallow
evaluation. Placed on standing IV lopressor.
.
4) A-fib c [**Name (NI) 5509**] - Pt occasionally with HR > 100. Given Lopressor
5 IV standing and prn lopressor for rate control.
.
5)CHF - TTE on [**10-16**] significant for mild systolic CHF (EF 50%)
with 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. CXR and exam consistent with fluid overload.
Pt was diuresed during MICU course and given gentle diuresis on
the floor. Likely would have benefited from ACE-I; however as
was NPO, ACE-I not started.
.
6) Lethargy- Most likely secondary to infection. Per family, pt
somewhat interactive but responds poorly to questions, could
also be progression of underlying dementia.  During hospital
course, pt was alternatively awake but not non-verbal and
ocasionally difficult to arouse. Avoided sedating meds.
Infectious w/u with abx as above.
.
7) Alzhemiers - Per family, pt is mostly non-verbal at baseline.

.
8) Thrombocytosis- Possibly secondary to infection/ acute phase
reactant.
.
9)  Anemia- baseline hct 37-38. Iron studies done in [**Month (only) 958**]
suggests anemia of chronic disease.
.
10) FEN - Pt had speech and swallow evaluation given concern for
aspiration pneumonia and did not pass initial exam. Was ordered
for a video swallow study in which pt did not swallow barium
mixed with juice, but rather regurgitated/spit it out, thus
making video swallow study inconclusive. Per speech and swallow,
unable to give recs for feeding given failure to perform video
swallow study. Discussed nutrition situation with family who
voiced strongly that pt would not want feeding tube. Given
overall poor prognosis, the family and HCP decided to make pt
[**Name (NI) 3225**].

11) Proph- pneumoboots. bowel regimen.
.
12) Access- PIV, family does not want CVL.
.
13) Code- DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP on [**10-18**]. [**Name2 (NI) 3225**].
.
14) [**Name (NI) 2638**] HCP is granddaughter [**Name (NI) 2127**] phone
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 51183**], wife is [**Name (NI) 8463**] (russian speaking only)
#[**Telephone/Fax (1) 51184**]

During hospital course, pt was made [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3225**] after discussion with
family and HCP. Within 48 hrs after passing, pt was made [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3225**].
