Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49F ESLD [**3-2**] HCV, s/p TIPS for refractory ascites, admitted
for rising TBili who subsequently developed respiratory failure
and was transfered to the MICU.

1. Sepsis: upon initial admission to the ICU the patient was
started on a 10 day, broad spectrum course of antibx
prophylactically given an episode of hypotension. The patient
completed this course of antibx. However on HD 17 the patient
became hypotensive with elevated wbc, and lactic acidosis to 15.
 She was reinitiated on broad spectrum antibx and pressors. She
was initally started on levophed but her BP's continued to
decrease and was then started on neosynephrine.  Given the
patient's critically ill state at this time, the patient family
was called.  The family decided to withdraw support and the
patient passed away peacefully several hours later.

2. Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to a pleural effusion
which was tapped. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent w/ a
transudate likely from ascites/liver failure.  Over the course
of several weeks the patient's respiratory status improved and
was successfully extubated on HD 15.  However, the patient was
reintubated on HD 17 after she developed sepsis from which she
died on HD 18.

3.  ESLD: Acute on chronic liver failure. Liver (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] and
Transplant were following. Given the patient's critically ill
state, she was not amenable to transplant during her hospital
course. Lactulose was continued for hepatic encephalopathy.

4) Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia - secondary to ESLD. The pt was
transfused FFP, cryroprecipitate, platelets, and pRBCs PRN.

5) ARF: Hepatorenal syndrome versus ATN (granular casts in
urine). UOP was poor. Renal was consulted and the patient was
initiated on CVVHD.

6) DM2: Insulin GTT.

7) Asthma: Cont nebs PRN.
