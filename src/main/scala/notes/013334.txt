CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted to the outside hospital for chest
pain and congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 70 year old male patient
admitted to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 32325**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**4-18**] with complaint of
chest pain and congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, status post old anterior inferior myocardial
infarction noted on cardiac consultation in [**2182**], last known
ejection fraction of 20% with a negative stress test in
[**2198-7-17**], history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure who presented
to the outside hospital primarily with cough and shortness of
breath.  Workup at the outside hospital included a chest
x-ray which showed evidence of congestive heart failure,
electrocardiogram with left bundle branch block.  The
patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and the patient had
ruled out for myocardial infarction with three serial CKs
with negative MB fractions.  The patient's maximum CK was 647
with an MB fraction of 6.2, the patient's troponins peaked at
0.96 which is high about two times the peak normal level at
the outside hospital.  According to the patient the patient
didn't have any real symptoms of specific chest pressure.  He
did have squisky left-sided, described by the patient on his
left side, not related to exercise.  The symptoms were
unrelieved when he moves around in his bed.  The patient also
described orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The
patient took three sublingual [**Year (4 digits) 32326**] with relief of
symptoms.  Symptoms have been occurring regularly, resolved
when he changes his body position but this time the pain
stayed and the patient took Nitroglycerin for the first time
in a couple of years.  It is unclear whether he decided to
take [**Name (NI) **] at this time but the patient went to the
Emergency Room after calling his primary care physician and
the primary care physician felt that the patient might have a
case of pneumonia.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient has persistent cough with
relatively yellow sputum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post anterior inferior wall myocardial infarction (found on
cardiac consultation in [**2182**]) last echocardiogram in [**2198-7-17**] with an ejection fraction of 20% and a mildly dilated
left ventricle with associated hypokinesis of the anterior
and inferior distribution, last stress test in [**2198-7-17**]
which showed no evidence of electrocardiogram changes and no
new echocardiogram abnormalities.  2.  Congestive heart
failure.  3.  Hypertension.  4.  Diabetes mellitus.  5.
Hyperlipidemia.  6.  History of asymptomatic ventricular
ectopy.

sodium of sodium 141, potassium 4.7, chloride 103,
bicarbonate 33, BUN 48, creatinine 1.6, glucose 45.  CK, here
was 562 with MB fraction of 7.6 and a troponin of 0.31.

A1c 6.7%, cholesterol 160 with LDL of 53, triglycerides 95
and HDL of 34.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6, pulse 65,
respirations 18, oxygen saturation 95% on 5 liters of nasal
cannula, blood pressure 136/60.  Generally pleasant in mild
shortness of breath, persistent cough, in no apparent
distress.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Lungsounds clear.  No evidence of
jugulovenous distension, no bruits, bibasilar rales,

beats/minute, T wave inversions in leads 1, AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old male with a history
of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with
documented ejection fraction of 20%, hypotension, diabetes
mellitus presented to an outside hospital with a complaint of
dyspnea, ruled out for myocardial infarction, he did have a
borderline troponin and was transfer to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization.
It was thought that the patient's symptoms were much more
consistent with congestive heart failure rather than coronary
artery disease.  The patient's BUN and creatinine have been
increasing in the setting of diabetes at the outside
hospital.  The patient's BUN there was 45 with a creatinine
of 1.6.  This was likely secondary to decreased renal
perfusion in the setting of worsening congestive heart
failure.  The patient was started on a beta blocker for his
coronary artery disease.  The patient's Lasix was initially
held with creatinine and the patient was slightly hydrated
for his cardiac catheterization.  The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on [**2200-4-22**].  Cardiac
catheterization showed an left ventricular ejection fraction
of 20%, left main coronary of 20%, left anterior descending
that was really diffusely diseased with 99 to 100% occlusion.
The left circumflex also had severe disease.  The right
coronary artery was totally occluded, the left collateral had
diseased 99 to 100%.  The Cardiothoracic Surgery consult was
obtained to evaluate this patient for possible coronary
artery bypass graft.  However, given the severity of his
disease it was felt there was likely no takeoff that would be
optimal for appropriate coronary artery bypass graft.
However Cardiothoracic Surgery requested a right hemivalvular
study and if there was evidence of bilobar     they would
consider a coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient was
actively diuresed after the catheterization as the cardiac
catheterization showed evidence for significant congestive
heart failure with cardiac index 1.79, wedge pressure 32.  It
was felt that the patient's congestive heart failure should
be optimized prior to a coronary artery bypass graft.  The
patient's Lasix was started at 40 mg intravenously and the
Congestive Heart Failure Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding
possible  changes to his medications.  The patient was
subsequently started on Digoxin 0.125 mg q. day due to
inotropia.  Neutrocor was started and increased to a maximum
dose of 0.03 mg/kg/min.  Lasix was slowly increased as the
patient was not adequately diuresing.  The patient's
creatinine began to increase and the Lasix was increased to
160 mg intravenously b.i.d. along with the Neutrocor of 0.03
mg/kg/min.  As the patient continued to not produce
significant output with the high doses of diuretics and the
patient's creatinine increased to 1.9 with BUN of 54, it was
felt that the patient should be transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit for Swan therapy to assist in his diuresis.  Of
note, prior to transfer to the Coronary Care Unit the patient
was becoming more hypertensive with systolic blood pressure
in the high 80s and low 90s.  In the Coronary Care Unit a
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and the patient's initial
numbers showed a cardiac output of 7, wedge pressure of 19
and index greater than 3.  De
