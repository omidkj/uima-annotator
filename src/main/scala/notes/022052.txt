bowel perforation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was placed in the intensive care postopertively
after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated
diverticula and a thrombectomy in the right lower extremity.
She was extubated on [**2160-5-15**] and placed on bipap.  she had
erythema around her wound and was started on vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and flagyl.  the patient continued to do well. She
had wet-dry dressing changes twice daily and the wound was
checked continually for the presence of granulation.  She began
tolerating regular food and began taking oral medications.  Her
baseline respiratory status continued to give her some
difficulty, but she has slowly improved although she needs
pulmonary rehabilitation.  She has had 10 days of antibiotics
and will continue on levofloxacin and flagyl for 4 days to
complete a 2 week course of antibiotics.  she will continue wet
to dry dressing changes and will need acute rehab for her
pulmonary status as well as to help her with dressing changes

need to be followed as an outpatient for INR tracking and dose
management
