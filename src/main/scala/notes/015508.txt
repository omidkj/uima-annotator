IMAGING:

ABD US [**2166-4-18**]:  IMPRESSION:
1) Paracentesis, marked.

2) Cholelithiasis, wall edema and thickening commonly associated
with cirrhosis. Common bile duct is not dilated.

3) Cirrhotiform liver with all vessels patent.

CXR [**4-18**]:  The heart is normal in size. The diaphragms are
somewhat elevated and there are small effusions and mild
bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. Mediastinal contours are
normal. There is no bone destruction.
IMPRESSION: There is no significant change in the chest since
[**2166-4-3**].

CXR [**4-23**]:  PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There are
developing bibasilar areas of consolidation. There are likely
small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart size is not
significantly changed. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
stable. No evidence of pneumothorax. The osseous structures are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral areas of consolidation consistent with
multifocal pneumonia. Follow-up study after clinical treatment
is recommended to demonstrate complete resolution.

MR Abdomen [**4-24**]:  IMPRESSION:
1) Patent portal and hepatic veins and IVC. No thrombosis
identified. The main portal vein also demonstrates hepatopetal
blood flow.
2) Findings consistent with the primary form of hemochromatosis.
Clinical correlation is recommended.
3) Liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension. No suspici
