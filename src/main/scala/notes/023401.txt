Date of Birth:  [**2034-11-6**]             Sex:   F

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, intraperitoneal bleed from ruptured hepatoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and celiac
arteriogram, supra selective left hepatic artery
catheterization with microsphere embolization of bleeding
arterial branch.

2. Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation
large amount of intra-abdominal blood and hematoma, cautery
of right hepatic lobe ruptured hepatoma

3. Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
78 F with history of hepatic cirrhosis of unclear etiology with
history of shunt, TIAs, HTN, presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with
abdominal pain and hypotension and tachycardia. HCT was 27. CT
scan of the abdomen revealed a 3x3 cm right lobe hepatic mass
with 1.4 cm vascular aneurysm and active extravasation of blood
into peritoneum and a large amount of blood in peritoneum.
Patient subsequently decompensated and became progressively more
tachycardic and hypotensive. She was intubated, fluid
resuscitated, and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Past Medical History:
Hepatic cirrhosis s/p operative shuntting at [**Hospital1 2025**] approximately
12 years ago (per husband), HTN, TIAs/stroke with residual left
sided paralysis, C.diff colitis, GERD, hearing loss, macular
degeneration.

Social History:
Distant smoking history. Rare, occasional alcohol.

Physical Exam:
The patient has passed away

Pertinent Results:
EEG

FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Several bursts of mixed theta and delta
frequency
slowing were noted in a generalized distribution.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was slow, typically in the 5 Hz
range,
and disorganized. A superimposed faster beta rhythm was also
noted in a
generalized distribution.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to frequent
bursts of
generalized mixed frequency slowing in the setting of a slow and

disorganized backgroung suggestive of a widespread
encephalopathy
consistent with bilateral subcortical or deeper midline
dysfunction.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and anoxia are
among the
common causes of encephalopathy. No focal, lateralized, or
clearly
epileptiform features were noted although encephalopathic
pictures can
sometimes obscure focal findings. No electrographic seizures
were
noted. The degree and evolution of the encephalopathy is
uncertain and
should be correlated with clinical exam or if follow up EEG if
necessary.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-11-22**] 4:49 PM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old woman with abnormal EEG, altered mental status, vent
dependent
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for structural cause of altered mental status
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 79-year-old woman with abnormal EEG, altered mental
status, please evaluate for obstructive causes of altered mental
status.

COMPARISON: CT head from [**2113-11-9**].

FINDINGS: There is evidence of low signal with susceptibility
artificat from chronic blood products at the right basal ganglia
extending into the temporal lobes along the sulci. There is also
associated dilation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ventricle. This
could be from chronic hemorrhage in that area with associated
volume loss of the temporal lobe.

There are bilateral hyperintensities noted in the region of
basal ganglia in the pre-gadolinium T1-weighted images,
features, usually associated with hepatic insufficiency.
Periventricular white matter hyperintensity suggestive of
chronic microangiopathic ischemic disease is noted. There is
mild prominence of the ventricles and the sulci suggestive of
age related atrophic changes. There are no areas of abnormal
enhancement or acute hemorrhage, masses, mass effect or midline
shift. No diffusion abnormalities are noted.

No osseous or soft tissue abnormalities are noted. Visualized
portions of the sinuses demonstrate mucus retention cyst in the
right maxillary sinus. Some fluid is noted in the left ethmoid
sinus.

IMPRESSION: Areas of susceptibility artifact in the right basal
ganglia suggestive of chronic right basal ganglia hemorrhage. No
acute intracranial process or hemorrhage or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course: Patient arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-2**]. She was found
to be hypotensive to 50 mm Hg systolic and in cardiac arrest.
She received 1 amp of Epi and fluid/colloids with good response.
She was taken emergently to angiography for intervention and
localization of bleed.  Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and
celiac
arteriogram, supra selective left hepatic artery catheterization
with microsphere embolization of bleeding arterial branch. She
continued to require resuscitation and had rising intraabdominal
pressures. In the setting of high ventilatory pressures there
was significant concern for the development of abdominal
compartment syndrome. She was taken emergently for exploratory
laparotomy, evacuation of large amount of intra-abdominal
blood/hematoma, cautery of right hepatic lobe ruptured hepatoma.
She was closed primarily and transferred to the surgical ICU for
further resuscitation. Her hypothermia was normalized as was her
coagulopathy.  Over the next several days her hematocrit
stabilized and acidemia improved. Drain outputs diminished and
she was diuresed with Lasix with good response. She was
extubated on POD    . Because of concern for aspiration a Speech
and Swallow evaluation was obtained on [**11-6**] and showed "silent"
aspiration with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia. She was started
on tube feeds. On [**11-8**] she developed epistaxis, likely [**2-17**]
nasogastric tube. ENT service was consulted and their exam
showed senechii and dried blood with some areas of erosion
overlying the mucosa. A Dobbhoff catheter was placed in the
contralateral nostril and tube feeding was resumed and advanced
to goal. She had no further bleeding from her nasopharynx.
Patients respiratory status improved and she was extubated on
[**2113-11-5**] (POD 3). She was actively diuresed with Lasix with good
results. On POD 4 a bedside swallowing consult was obtained and
patient was found to be "silently aspirating" and had severe
dysphagia. PO trials were held and tube feeds were continued.
On POD 7 patient became more confused and less responsive. A CT
scan of her head was obtained ( [**2113-11-9**]) and showed no acute
pathology. Lactulose was started for an elevated ammonia level.
On POD 8 a RUQ ultrasound was obtained and showed normal
vascular flows and cirrhotic liver.  On [**11-11**] patient became
progressively hypoxic with increased work of breathing and was
re-intubated.
Over the following several days she developed a leukocytosis and
fevers.  She was started on vancomycin. Blood, sputum, urine and
line cultures were sent and eventually returned with MRSA from
her sputum as well as blood. She was continued on vancomycin
with goal level 15-20.  Attempt to wean ventilatory support were
unsuccessful. A meeting with the family was held and the family
expressed interest in continuing support.
Given her failure to wean off of ventilatory support, a
tracheostomy was placed on [**11-17**].  She continued to require
intermittent Haldol/Ativan for agitation.
Hematocrit continued to be stable.

The patient remained intermittently agitated without significant
change in neurological status and unable to be weaned off of the
vent.

On [**11-24**] social work met with the family and agreed to make the
patient CMO and extubate on Wednesday [**11-29**].

On [**11-29**] the ventilator was removed and the paitient made
comfort measures
