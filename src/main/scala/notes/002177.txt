History of Present Illness:
73 year old female who began to develop exertional arm and chest
pain this past [**Month (only) 547**]. She was referred to a cardiologist who
performed an exercise tolerance test which was positive for
ischemia. She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed
severe coronary artery disease with a 50% left main stenosis,
80%
LAD and 90% RCA. Given these findings, she has been referred for
surgical evaluation.

Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA

Conclusions
Pre CPB:
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s).
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. No aortic regurgitation
is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified
in person of the results.
Epi-Aortic ultrasound performed prior to cannulation.

Post CPB:
Aortic contours intact.
No change in mild MR.
Preserved or slightly improved biventricular systolic function.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2140-8-25**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and
underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x3,(left internal
mammary artery, left anterior descending coronary
 artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to
the ramus intermedius coronary artery; as well  as reverse
saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary
artery) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please see operative report for further
details. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CVICU intubated and sedated in critical but stable
condition. She awoke neurologically intact and was weaned to
extubate without difficulty. All lines and drains were
discontinued [**Female First Name (un) **] timely fashion. Beta-Blocker/Statin?aspirin and
diuresis was initiated. POD#2 she was transferred to the step
down unit for further monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted
for evaluation of strength and mobility. The remainder of her
post operative course was essentially uneventful. She continued
to progress and was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge to home
with VNA on POD#4. All follow up appointments were advised.
