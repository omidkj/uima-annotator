Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Probable RV dysfunction during cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PCI w/o stent, IABP, Swan placement

History of Present Illness:
66 y/o female with PMH significant for RCA stent in [**2187**],
cardiomyopathy, HTN, and hyperlipidemia admitted to the CCU
following cath complicated by hypotension and probable RV
infarct. Pt was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**5-8**]
with shortness of breath. Over the preceeding several weeks, she
had had multiple admissions at the OSH for SOB. On the evening
prior to admission, the pt developed wheezing and increased SOB.
She took lasix and her inhalers without relief so called 911. On
their evaluation, her VS were significant for an oxygen sat of
88% on RA, HR of 132, BP of 157/99. She was given SL NTG and
combivent nebs and felt mildly beter on arrival to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
There, her oxygen sat was 91% on a 100% nonrebreather, HR 119,
and BP 147/104. Pt was treated with IV solumedrol, Mg sulfate,
80 mg IV lasix, and zopenex neb. During this time, the pt denied
CP or palpitations. Admission ECG was significant for sinus tach
at 106 with first degree AV block and LBBB (per report-no
tracing available at this time).
.
There was a concern at [**Hospital3 3583**] if the pt's SOB was due
to a COPD exacerbation versus heart failure. A cardiology
consult was obtained. The pt was ruled out for an MI with
cardiac enzymes. She was treated for a COPD flair (nebs,
steroids, oxygen, aldactone) with some improvement in symptoms.
The pt was agressively diuresed initially but backed off on the
lasix several days into admission secondary to an increase in
creatinine. Pt had two episodes of asymptomatic NSVT on tele
(one of four beats and one of seven beats). Per the cardiology
consult recs, the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a cath and
consideration of AICD placement.
.
Pt underwent cath at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-14**]. This was significant for a
right dominant circulation with single vessel and branch vessel
disease. The LMCA was angiographically normal. LAD system had a
70% stenosis of a moderate sized first diagonal and was
otherwise angiographically normal. The LCX was a small vessel
supplying a single OM that was free of disease. RCA was
subtotally occluded in both the proximal and mid segment within
the prior stents with TIMI II flow distally via antegrade and
also filled via collaterals from the distal LAD. During
attempted stenting of the RV branch of the RCA, the pt became
hypotensive into the 70s systolic. There was a concern that the
pt was suffering from RV dysfunction in the setting of her
severe LV dysfunction. She was started on dopamine and an
intraaortic balloon pump was placed. Pt was on the dopamine for
six minutes. The pt's BP quickly recovered and she was weaned
off of the dopamine. Pt was then started on a nitro drip for
hypertension approximately ten minutes later. Pt also received
20 mg of IV lasix in the cath lab. At this time, she is
hemodynamically stable and has been transferred to the CCU for
further care. Plan is to leave the balloon pump in place over
the next 24 hours. Then, pt will need to be reevaluated with a
viability scan of the inferior wall. If her RCA territory has
completely infarcted, she will need possible cath and stenting
of her diag. If some RCA territory is still viable, she may be a
candidate for CABG.
.
Hemodynamics during the cath were as follows: at the start of
the case, the pt had moderately elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with a RVEDP of 12, mean PCWP of 19, and LVEDP
of 20. At the conclusion of the case, the PCWP was 20. Left
ventriculography showed gloval severely depressed systolic
function with a LVEF of 18%. No significant mitral regurg.
.
In discussion with the pt, she reports that she is feeling quite
well on admission to the CCU. No recent fevers or chills. She
reports that she never has CP, chest pressures, chest burning,
or palpitations. She has been suffering from increased SOB over
the past several weeks but reports that her breathing now feels
comfortable. She is not on oxygen at home and does not use
steroids. She is able to walk in her home and sometimes around
the house, but is unable to walk even half a block outside. No
PND or orthopnea. Pt has a chronic cough but no sputum
production. Denies abdominal pain but feels hungrey. No LE
tingling or numbness.

Past Medical History:
1. S/P MI and RCA stent in [**2187**]- Done at [**Hospital1 2177**]. Now about 99%
occluded. LVEF at that time was 60% but has decreased since
then. Last month, P-MIBI was significant for septal ischemia and
a LVEF of 18%. There is a large predominantly fixed inferior
defect and a septal anterior apical defect with some partial
reversibility.
2. Cardiomyopathy- Most recent LVEF was 18% by P-MIBI in
03/[**2193**]. The LV was grossly dilated. Felt to be ischemic and
non-ischemic in nature.
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
5. Hypertension
6. S/P [**Name (NI) 10060**] Pt had right arm paralysis for two days when she was
44 years old. No residual deficits from this.
7. COPD
8. PVD
9. Renal artery stenosis s/p vein bypass grafting

10. Anxiety
11. Mitral regurgitation

Social History:
Pt is single and lives alone. She is retired. She has three
adult children. She quit smoking approximately six years ago
after smoking three packs per day since age 12. Rare ETOH use.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel and branch vessel disease. The LMCA
was
angiographically normal. The LAD system had a 70% stenosis of a
moderate
sized first diagonal and was otherwise angiographically normal.
The LCX
was a small vessel supplying a single OM that was free of
disease. The
RCA was subtotally occluded in both the proximal and mid segment
within
the prior stents with TIMI II flow distally via antegrade and
also
filled via collaterals from the distal LAD.
2. Resting hemodynamics at the start of the case [**Last Name (un) **]
moderately
elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP=12
mmHg, mean
PCWP=19 mmHg and LVEDP=20 mmHg. At the end of the case mean PCWP
was 20
mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated global severely depressed
systolic
function with LVEF calculated at 18% with no significant mitral
regurgitation.
4. Unsuccessful PTCA of the RCA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Unsuccessful PTCA of the RCA.
