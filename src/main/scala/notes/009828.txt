Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:

This is a 50 year old woman with a past medical history of DM,
HTN, and chronic pain who presented to the ED with lip and
facial swelling, with no signs of airway compromise.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:

# Angioedema: Patient presented with lip/face/tongue swelling,
no rashes or hives, no airway compromise. Allergy was consulted
and confirmed that it is likely secondary to lisinopril which
she has been taking since 9/[**2145**]. Her mother also had a similar
reaction when she took lisinopril. Labs were drawn for C3, C4,
CRP, and C1 esterase for possible C1 esterase deficiency. She
was given 125mg IV solumedrol and then transitioned to 60mg PO
prednisone daily, as well as benadryl 25mg Q6h and famotidine
20mg Q12. Angioedema had improved by MICU day #2 so she was
called out to the floor. On the floor, she had no further
complications. The floor team followed Allergy's recommendations
and discharged her with their recommended medications to take
for 3 days after discharge since her symptoms had nearly
resolved: prednisone taper, famotidine, and benedryl. C1
esterase results were not yet back when she left, but she was
advised to follow up in allergy clinic. She was also counseled
on avoiding ACE inhibitors in the future.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# Diabetes: The patient's home medication (metformin) was held,
and she was placed on an insulin sliding scale. Her finger stick
BGs were recorded, all under 200. She complained of headaches
secondary to the higher than normal BGs (presumably from
starting prednisone). Her headaches were treated with her home
medication (imitrex), which helped. She was worried about not
being on metformin, so she was restarted on it on the floor at
her home dose.

# Chronic pain disorder: The patient reported chronic back and
leg pains and headache (see above) that were not out of
proportion to her normal pain level. She was kept on her home
medications, baclofen, gabapentin, acetaminophen as needed. Her
codeine was held given sedation with benadryl.

# Asthma: The patient was asymptomatic while in the hospital.
She was continued on singulair, fluticasone, and albuterol PRN
without complications

# HTN: She was normotensive throughout her hospital course. We
continued her home Triamterene-HCTZ dose.

# LVH: The patient reports she was taking lisinopril for LVH.
She did not develop signs of decompensated CHF or volume
overload despite receiving IV fluids. Lisinopril was held given
angioedema. We recommended that she follow up with her PCP
regarding alternatives to ACE Inhibitors. There was concern that
starting her on an angiotensin receptor inhibitor may produce
the same reaction.

# Depression: She was asymptomatic throughout her stay. We
continued her celexa and held trazodone given sedation with
benadryl.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

#. C1 Esterase results: The patient and her PCP will be notified
when her results return. Suspicion for C1 Esterase deficiency is
low. She was also urged to follow up at the [**Hospital 9039**] Clinic.

#. BG levels: The patient was concerned about her BG levels
getting too high, causing her migraines, while being on po
prednisone. We reassured her that the BG levels would only be
elevated temporarily while on prednisone, and that they were not
running high enough to warrant starting a new medication. She
was advised to continue her same dose of metformin, take tylenol
prn for headaches, and to follow up with her PCP at the
appointment scheduled for her to reassess.
