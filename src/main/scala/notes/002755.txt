Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
Speech difficulty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left CEA per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] on [**2169-4-19**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105691**] (previous spelling incorrect as Rhineharist and a
new [**Hospital **] medical record was created) is an 80 year old right
handed male with complex medical history including prior TIA,
possible seizure disorder, now presenting with difficulty
speaking. The patient is unable to provide a complete history as
a result of his language deficit. He lives alone and cannot
provide a proxy at the moment. [**Name2 (NI) **] report intermittent difficulty
with balancing his checkbook over the last few days prior to
admission. He reported something was wrong on the day of
admission with sudden intermittent difficulty speaking
associated with right hand numbness and clumsiness. He was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where a head CT revealed question of a left
frontal lobe mass.

He was evaluated by neurosurgery and admitted for MRI. Two days
following his initial admission, MRI reveals subacute infarcts
in the inferior division of the L MCA. Neurology was then
consulted to evaluate the patient.

Upon my comparison of the patient's license in his wallet to his
current ID band there is a discrepancy in the spelling of his
last name. Revealing that the patient has an extensive previous
medical history here at this institution. The patient is able to
tell me that his PCP his here at [**Hospital1 18**].

MRI is without any vessel imaging. The patient was taking plavix
for coronary and carotid stents and this is currently being held
for unclear reasons. The patient is unable to offer any further
HPI. At present he denies any headache. He is well aware of his
difficulty in speech production. He reports difficulty with
handwriting, he is unable to hold a pen in his right hand
despite normal strength. He reports right hand diminished
sensation. No bowel or bladder
incontinence. He reports his gait has been unsteady for ? amount
of time.

ROS: denies any F/C/NS, + chronic cough and singultus, no chest
pain. no abdominal pain. no N/V, no diarrhea, no constipation.

Past Medical History:
-Hypertension
-Peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease, s/p distal aortic stenting
-Chronic renal insufficiency
-Multiple TIAs in [**2161**]. Then with right hand weakness in [**2164**]
and
now s/p L ICA stent in [**11-25**]
-Autonomic neuropathy, with evidence of both sympathetic and
parasympathetic dysfunction on autonomic testing
-Prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy
-Hyperlipidemia
-Gout
-Enhancing lesion, thought to be a meningioma in the anterior
cranial fossa
-? h/o Clivus lesion on MRI, bone scan negative

Social History:
He lives alone in [**Location 1268**]. Widowed from his second
marriage, son lives in [**State 531**] City - [**Name (NI) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 105692**]. He
has a sig other [**Doctor Last Name 636**] "[**Doctor First Name 7019**]" [**Location (un) **]. He is retired from a
medical supplier shipping business.  He has an 80-pack-year
smoking history; he quit 18 years ago. He denies any ETOH or
illicit drug use.

with obvious speech deficit, NAD
HEENT: NCAT, OP clear, MMM, Anicteric sclera
Neck- no carotid bruits bilat. Left sided neck incision is c/d/i

CV- RRR, no MRG
Pulm- diffuse, prominent expiratory wheezes
Abd- protuberant, soft, nd, nt, BS+
Extrem- no CCE

Neurologic Exam:
MS- alert, arouses easily to voice, attentive to examination,
speech is of variable fluency, largely nonfluent, his naming is
intact to high and low frequency objects, he makes some frequent
paraphasic errors with spontaneous speech, repitition is
impaired. He is able to read some simple phrases, but then
perseverates and does not read more complex sentences. He is
unable to write. No difficulty with praxis for combing hair,
brushing teeth. No neglect.

CN- PERRL 3-->2mm bilat, EOMI, no nystagmus, VFF to
confrontation, his facial musculature appears symmetric, full
facial strength, facial sensation diminished to pinprick R
V2,V3. hearing intact to FR, palate elevates symm, SCM and trap
are [**4-25**], tongue at midline.

Motor- increased tone in all extremities, no cogwheeling. no
adventitious movements. R pronator drift. Strength is full in
all muscles tested including delt, tri, [**Hospital1 **], WE, FE, FF, IP, Q,
H, TA, PF, [**Last Name (un) 938**].

Sensory- diminished PP, LT, temperature, prop on right hemibody
(face, arm, trunk, leg).

Reflexes- Absent [**Hospital1 **], tri, brachioradialis, 1+ patellars, absent
ankle jerks.

Coordination- intact FNF, slightly slowed [**Doctor First Name 6361**] bilaterally
(symmetrically).

Gait- poor initiation, shortened stride, unsteady.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**4-14**]:
IMPRESSION: 1.6 x 1.3 cm left frontal hyperdense brain mass. MRI
is
recommended for further evaluation.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**4-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of slow diffusion consistent with
acute infarction in the left MCA [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] distribution,
involving the subcortical white matter, likely consistent with
embolic disease. No mass lesion or abnormal enhancement is
identified at the site of hyperdensity seen on recent CT.
Multiple scattered FLAIR hyperintensity areas likely consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemic changes in the subcortical
white matter.

CTA Head and Neck [**4-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major
territorial
infarction. Small regions of embolic infarction within the left
MCA territory are better appreciated on the DWI sequence of
recent MRI.
2. Severe luminal stenosis involving the right internal carotid
artery just distal to its bifurcation, of at least 80%.
Significant stenosis is present involving the left internal
carotid artery at the cranial aspect of the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] stent and a
short segment beyond with at least 60% stenosis.
3. Mild paraseptal emphysematous changes within the lung apices.

4. Moderate irregularly ulcerated plaque within the aortic arch
incidentally noted.

Carotid Series Complete [**4-17**]
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On the right there is significant heterogeneous plaque
in the carotid bulb/ICA. on the left there is a patent LT
ICA/CCA stent with some mild to moderate narrowing distal to
stent .

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are141/33, 160/43, 55/15,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 83 cm/sec. ECA peak
systolic velocity is 107 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.9. These
findings are consistent with 60-69% stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 70/26, 119/43, 102/31, cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 72 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 123 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.6. These findings are consistent with
40-59% stenosis.

There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.
Impression: Right ICA stenosis 60-69
Left ICA stenosis 40-59


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 80 year old man admitted to Neurosurgery service on
[**4-14**] with difficulty speaking and now transferred to Neurology
for stroke workup. He has hx of TIA in [**2161**], two admissions for
TIA in [**2164**], first with aphasia and then subsequently for right
hand weakness, received left ICA stent in [**2164**]. He has been on
aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor since the ICA stenting. He has
history of two amnestic episodes and multiple episodes of
left-sided weakness. He is being evaluated for possible simple
partial seizures and complex partial seizures. He has been on
Keppra since [**2167**]. A
