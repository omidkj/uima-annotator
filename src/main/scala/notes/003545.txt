Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
Central Venous line
Endotracheal intubation
Arterial Line


History of Present Illness:
60yo woman w/ hx of COPD, PAH w/ cor pulmonale, right-sided CHF,
CKD who presents from rehab facility with several days of
fatigue and altered mental status. Over the past several months
she has undergone prolonged course with several hospitalizations
including a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 49798**] for shortness of
breath thought intially to be pneumonia but eventually
atrributed to COPD exacerbation as opposed to infection. Family
states she has never returned to baseline at rehab complaining
of increasing fatigue, continued shortness of breath, and now
altered mental status which was noted to be primarily increasing
somnolence. She otherwise has denied any fever, chills,
headache, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
Of note she is supposed to be using bipap for severe OSA but has
poor compliance due to intolerance of the bipap.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 92 97/72 28 95% neb.  Physical
exam notable for tachypnea.  She was given IV methylprednisone
125 mg, vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin and nebs for COPD
exacerbation.  500 cc NS was given for tachycardia and low blood
pressure.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was noted to be somewhat somnolent
but opened eyes to voice and followed basic commands. Her
respiratory effort was shallow with low tidal volumes and
generally low minute ventilation (range 4 to 6L/min) given her
severe hypercarbia. She subsequently was intubated.
.
Review of systems:
Unable to complete review due to patient being sedated and
intubated.


Past Medical History:

2. Obstructive sleep apnea (noctural BiPAP 18/15, home oxygen
requirement of 3-4L via nasal cannula)

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old woman with history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), pulmonary artery
hypertension (PAH) with cor pulmonale, (chronic kidney disease
(CKD) who presented from rehab facility with several days of
fatigue and shortness of breath.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Required intubation in the ED
prior to transfer to the MICU.  Likely a COPD exacerbation (with
pCO2 140 on admission) and recent non-compliance of her BiPAP at
rehab (although previously very compliant even during the day).
Also, she has obstructive sleep apnea which contributes to her
PAH and cor pulmonale.  Lastly, a superimposed pneumonia was
considered [**1-30**] a small amount of opacity on initial CXR and one
fever.  She was started on vancomycin/cefepime/levofloxacin
initially for empiric coverage of PNA, but suspicion was low
(she never had a WBC count or recurrence of fever) and
vanc/cefepime were stopped after a few days and she was
continued only on levofloxacin for 7 days for abx coverage in
the setting of a COPD exacerbation. She did have a bronch after
a few days on the ventilator which demonstrated severe airway
edema and almost complete airway collapse on exhalation. While
the most likely etiology of her airway edema and collapse was
from pulmonary edema and pulmonary parenchymal volume overload,
given she had signs of decreased left-sided cardiac output,
aggressive diuresis was not pursued. She was treated with
systemic and inhaled corticosteroids to address a possible
component of inflammation contributing to her airway edema, as
well a scheduled nebulizers for bronchodilation. Due to
persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure the patient underwent
a tracheostomy for long term assisted ventilation and CPAP.
Patient tolerated the procedure well. Her cultures remained
negative. Prior to discharge her vent settings were weaned to
pressure support 10, PEEP 5, FiO2 40% which she was tolerating
well.

# Abdominal pain. Patient started complaining of diffuse, crampy
abdominal pain several days prior to discharge. In reviewing
recent OMR notes, she has been extensively evaluated by her PCP
and GI over the month prior to admission for the same pain. KUB
showed diffuse gas distension throughout her bowels but no clear
obstructive process. Her tube feeds continued to be well
tolerated despite her pain, with minimal nausea and no vomiting,
and she continued to have multiple daily stools; all of which
decrease the liklihood of bowel obstruction. We restarted her on
Donnatal, a home medication that we were holding that GI had
suggested prior to admission to treat her symptoms. She was
being discharged on the day of restarting this medication so
efficacy of intervention will need to be assessed by ECF. She
was also started on simethicone and given zofran prn for mild
nausea that she experienced several times during her hospital
course
