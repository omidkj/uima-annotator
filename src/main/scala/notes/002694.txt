MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2170-12-13**] 5:55 pm URINE     Site: CATHETER
   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2170-12-16**]):
      CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
