ERCP BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT  [**2120-4-25**] 1:46 PM
FINDINGS: Six spot fluoroscopic images were obtained without a
radiologist present. The ampulla was cannulated and retrograde
injection of contrast into the biliary tree performed. Only the
common duct is included in the field of view which is noted to
be mildly dilated. The common duct is not fully distended with
contrast on these images. There is no filling of the cystic duct
remnant. The distal common duct demonstrates smooth tapering. A
plastic biliary stent was then placed. For further detail,
reference to the ERCP report of the same date is suggested.
.
CXR [**2120-4-29**]
Cardiomegaly and pulmonary arterial hypertension, without acute
cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo female with post prandial LUQ pain post ERCP with
sphincterotomy x 1 week ago for cholelithiasis.
.
# LUQ pain:
This can be mesenteric ischemia related given relationship to
food. But given elevated LFTS and bili, more likely from biliary
obstruction (though pain pattern is odd). US also argues for
this with finding of nonshadowing stone or dependent sludge; ?
of thrombus given sphincterotomy as well. Pancreatitis also on
diff given elevated lipase - but relapsing/remitting pain is not
consistent. Noted that extraheptic duct is now 8mm versus 1.2cm
from ERCP last week. ERCP [**4-25**] with cannulation of bile duct,
CBD dilatation 15mm, no filling defects, 7 cm x 10F biliary
stent placed.
- pending pre-op risk assessment with pMIBI
- possible lap cholecystectomy tonight/saturday based on pMIBI
results
- ERCP, cytology from narrowing and stent pull in 6 weeks
- keep NPO, cont IVFs
- continue abx for 10 days
- trend LFTs, especially t bili
- holding ASA, naproxen, tylenol #3, fioricet, [**Month/Year (2) **], lasix,
calcium citrate
- GI and surgery following
.
# Pre-op risk assessment:
Pt with hx of CHF, HTN, lung disease, and DM. She has
compensated heart failure placing her at intermediate risk. The
surgery, lap vs open, has intermediate to high risk as its
peritoneal. She had cath in [**2115**] that revealed diastolic
dysfunction, nuclear stress test in [**2118**] was normal, echo last
year with mild LVH, EF >75%, nl LV function/size. EKG with 1st
degree AV block. Issue is her exercise capacity as she is now
limited by pain in her feet and cannot determine current risk
stratification due to lack of recent testing. She sometimes gets
SOB with exertion and climbing flight of stairs, however, this
may not be reliable.
- pMIBI today, if normal then to OR
- may need further cardiac eval based on MIBI results
.
# Gout:
Per outpatient rheumatologist, avoid colchicine at this time.
She got one dose on evening of admission. Uric acid 3.7, within
normal range.
- holding naproxen and ASA
- to followup with outpatient rhematologist
.
# CHF:
Not vol overloaded at this time.
- holding lasix
- monitor hemodynamics
.
# FEN:
- NPO for procedure and abdominal pain
- cont IVF

# PPX
- SC heparin (hold in AM)

Ms [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR on HD#2, [**2120-4-25**] for open
cholecystectomy. Post-operatively she was taken to the PACU and
extubated. POD#[**2-13**] she remained in TSICU due to low urine output
and acute renal failure. She was transfused 1 unit of prbcs and
given lasix IV. Her pain was well controlled by PCA and tylenol.
She remained NPO with IV fluids and IV antibiotics. Her urine
output increased and her creatinine continued to approach her
baseline. POD#3 she was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 for further
recovery. She tolerated clear liquids without difficulty. Her
abdomen remained soft and nontender, incision intact with
staples. She remained on nasal cannula oxygen during the day and
BIPAP at night. Her diet was advanced to regular. IV fluids were
discontinued and her pain well controlled with Tylenol #3. She
experienced worsening shortness of breath at rest. She was
aggressively diuresed with IV lasix with fair effect. She was
stabilized on a regimen of Lasix 40 mg po BID. POD#4 she was
seen by physical therapy, but she was unable to ambulate due to
pain in her feet related to gout. Rheumatology was consulted and
she was initiated on Naproxyn. She continued to improve and was
able to ambulate without difficulty POD#5. She will be
discharged with one day of Levofloxacin. She was discharged in
stable condition to [**Hospital 100**] rehab for physical therapy.
