EKG [**2177-5-13**]:
Sinus rhythm
Left atrial abnormality
Early precordial QRS transition - is nonspecific
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2177-4-25**], atrial ectopy absent
.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST [**2177-5-14**]:
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is an air-fluid level and focal dilatation of the mid
esophagus, which could suggest an esophageal disorder.
The heart appears normal and there are no pleural or pericardial
effusions. There is a segmental pulmonary embolism in the right
lower lobe, and an additional segmental pulmonary embolism in
the left upper lobe.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.  There is fusiform
dilatation of the entire descending aorta to 33 mm in diameter,
minimally increased since the prior study, when it measured 29
mm.  Focal irregularity of the descending aorta at the
diaphragmatic hiatus is unchanged.  There is mild interstitial
edema in the lungs, but no focal consolidation.  There are trace
effusions.  A cystic lesion in the pancreas is unchanged and
minimal prominence of the pancreatic duct is unchanged is also
again noted and similar.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli.  Chronic stable
opacity at the right base of 15 mm in diameter, which may
represent scar.
2.  Stable cystic lesion in the pancreas.
.
KUB [**2177-5-14**]:  The TrapEase filter is projecting at the level of
L3, L2 vertebra onthe right side.  Incidental note is made of
levoconvex scoliosis with its tip at the level of L3.  The
distribution of the bowel gas within the large bowel is
unremarkable with stool and gas noted within the sigmoid colon
and rectum. The bladder is filled with IV contrast, most likely
due to recent procedure.
IMPRESSION: Recently positioned TrapEase filter is projecting
along right side of L2- L3 in the region of the IVC.
.
BILATERAL LENIS [**2177-5-14**]:
FINDINGS:  No comparisons.  Grayscale, color, and pulse wave
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.  Normal flow,
compressibility, waveforms, and augmentation are demonstrated
bilaterally.  No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities.
.
ULTRASOUND OF IVC FILTER [**2177-5-14**]:
Ultrasound evaluation of the inferior vena cava demonstrates
linear
hyperdensities in the supraumbilical aspect of the IVC likely
represent IVC filter. Color and pulse wave Doppler exams of the
IVC proximal and distal to the filter demonstrate patent blood
flow.
IMPRESSION:  Patent IVC filter.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli:  Diagnosed by CTA chest
in the ED.  Admitted to unit for anticoagulation given
relatively recent GI bleed for close monitoring.  Hematocrit
remained stable despite one guaic positive stool (but
supratherapeutic on heparin gtt at the time).  Patient was
continued on an IV heparin gtt until her INR was therapeutic on
coumadin x 48 hours.  Her hematocrit remained stable.  Prior to
the initiation of coumadin therapy, a discussion was held with
the patient and her granddaughter to discuss the risk of a
life-threatening GI bleed with this intervention.  The
alternative risk of life-threatening arrhythmia and hypotension
with a progressive pulmonary embolus was also discussed.  The
granddaughter and the patient both wished to go ahead with
anticoagulation.  PCP was notified via email of the plan of
treatment.  Patient will follow-up with her primary care doctor
this week to follow-up her hospital admission.  She will also
have daily INRs by VNA to monitor her coumadin and will have her
hematocrit rechecked in 2 days.
.
# Fusiform aortic dilation:  Noted on CTA with note of
progression since her prior CT but no evidence of dissection.
Patient informed of an additional risk of aortic dissection and
life-threatening bleeding from this.  She will follow-up with
her primary care doctor for continued monitoring of this
aneurysm.
.
# Esophageal dilation:  Air-fluid level noted on chest CTA.
Patient denied any complaints of GERD.  Her initial chest pain
that brought her in did not recur while in house.  She was
continued on her sucralfate and PPI.  She is s/p a recent EGD
[**11-11**] with similar evidence of a patulous esophagus.
.
# Acute renal failure:  Resolved with small bolus of IVF.
.
# Anemia: Labs suggest AOCD.  Hematocrit remained stable.  On
iron as an outpatient.  PCP to [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] for monitoring.
.
# Dispo: discharged home with services (VNA for coumadin
monitoring, medication assistance, and home safety evaluation),
cleared by PT
