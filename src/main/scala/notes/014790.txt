Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness, intracranial thalamic hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-14**] Intubation, mechanical ventilation
4/15 PEG/tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
69M experienced Right sided weakness, aphasia and headache at
home. Found to have Left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
From medicine admission note, [**2103-3-23**]:
In brief, 69 yo M with HTN, CAD s/p PPM, CKD, OSA who presented
on [**2103-3-14**] to an OSH after a sudden fall and found to have a
large intraparenchymal hemorrhage thought to be due to a
hypertensive bleed. He was at an outside hospital and intubated
for airway protection and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]. He was in
the neurologic ICU and extubated on [**2103-3-15**] but had difficulty
clearning his secretions and was reintubated. He ultimately
needed a trach and PEG and was taken off the ventilator a couple
of days ago. He was febrile on [**2103-3-21**] to 101 and was found to
have urine with pseudomonas and enterococcus. He was started on
vancomycin and zosyn. A BAL was done and shows 3+ GNR but the
culture then grew oral flora. C diff was negative x 2, BCx have
been negative.
<br>
His course was also complicated also by acute on chronic renal
insufficiency. Nephrology was consulted and thinks this is ATN
and some volume depletion. He may need renal replacement therapy
in the future but is stable now.

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-3-14**] ECG: Atrial paced rhythm. Right bundle-branch block with
left anterior fascicular block. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
[**2103-3-14**] CXR: 1. ET tube has its tip approximately 59 mm from the
carina. The NG tube has its tip in the distal esophagus and
should be advanced further. 2. Cardiomegaly with atelectasis in
the right mid zone.
.
[**2103-3-14**] CT Head: 1. Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered
within the left thalamus with mild surrounding edema and
associated mass effect as described above. There is
intraventricular extension, with no evidence for development of
hydrocephalus. 2. Air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses,
likely secondary to intubation. 3. NG tube is coiled within the
posterior nasopharynx.
.
[**2103-3-15**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular
paced beats. Left bundle-branch block with left axis deviation.
Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2103-3-14**] atrial
fibrillation and ventricular pacing appear new. Atrial pacing is
no longer seen.
.
[**2103-3-15**] CT Head: Unchanged large left thalamic intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect
compressing the mid brain, with significant compression of the
left cerebral peduncle. Intraventricular extension is unchanged.
Unchanged coiled appearance of the nasogastric tube in the
posterior nasopharynx as previously indicated.
However, if there is concern for acute infarction as a cause for
the new
symptoms, MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] is more sensitive and ideal to be performed.
.
[**2103-3-15**] Portable CXR: Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal
junction was obtained for assessing nasogastric tube, which has
been advanced into the stomach. Within the imaged portion of the
chest, there has been improved aeration at the lung bases with
resolution of atelectatic changes.
.
[**2103-3-16**]: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular premature beats or
[**Last Name (un) **] beats. Intraventricular conduction delay. Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing ventricular
pacing is no
longer noted. Clinical correlation and repeat tracing are
suggested.
.
[**2103-3-17**]: Portable CXR: Lungs are grossly clear. Mild
cardiomegaly is unchanged. Dual-lead left chest wall cardiac
pacemaker wires follow expected course. Nasogastric tube tip is
in the stomach. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube.
.
[**2103-3-20**] CT C-spine: There is no malalignment or loss of
vertebral body height. Degenerative changes are seen from C3
through C6, but no significant stenosis is identified. There is
no definite fracture seen.
There is a possible hypodense nodule in the left thyroid lobe
measuring
approximately 13 mm. This can be assessed with ultrasound when
the patient is stable.
.
[**2103-3-20**] CT head: Relatively stable left thalamic hematoma.
.
[**2103-3-21**] CXR: 1. No evidence of acute pneumonia. Unchanged
cardiomegaly.
2. Tip of NG tube likely in the distal esophagus. Recommend
advancing 10 cm for optimal placement.
.
[**2103-3-22**] Carotid dopplers :No evidence of hematoma along the
right aspect of the neck. No evidence of arteriovenous fistula
or pseudoaneurysm of the right carotid artery.
.
[**2103-3-22**] CXR Portable: In comparison with the study of [**3-21**],
there is a huge amount of subdiaphragmatic air consistent with
the recent PEG placement. Continued moderate cardiomegaly in
patient with dual-channel pacer device in place.  Tracheostomy
tube is in good position. Mild suggestion of some air
bronchogram in the retrocardiac region. This could be a
manifestation of an early developing consolidation.
.
[**2103-3-24**] Renal ultrasound: Echogenic kidneys consistent with
medical renal disease. Large simple cyst on the right. No
hydronephrosis or evidence of obstruction. Bladder not well
evaluated.
.
[**2103-3-27**] CXR Portable:  In comparison with the study of [**3-22**],
there has been some decrease in the free intraperitoneal gas,
though somewhat less than would be expected.  Has the patient
had any interval abdominal surgery or a continued air leak?
There is increased opacification at the left base with
silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and poor visualization of the
descending aorta. In view of the clinical appearance, the
possibility of pneumonia at the left base must be seriously
considered. The costophrenic angles are poorly seen and small
pleural effusions may be present bilaterally. Tracheostomy tube
remains in place, as does the dual-channel pacemaker.
.
[**2103-3-28**] Right upper extremity ultrasound: Negative for right
upper extremity clot.
