History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 34578**] is a 58yoM with a history of B-cell non-Hodgkin's
Lymphoma who presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on [**2133-6-26**]
with fever and hypotension. He recently had developed bad
mucositis [**1-14**] round 3 of CHOP, and had some difficulty
swallowing. He was found to have a LUL cavitating lesion, was
started on Zosyn and voriconazole and admitted to the ICU. He
was not intubated. A BAL was done and showed mold, with
suspicion of Aspergillus (outside record does not state why
aspergillus suspected). He improved on zosyn/voriconazole, and
repeat CXR on [**7-2**] showed improvement in LUL infiltrate, but
large right sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed
and 1.5L fluid was drained. Pt's course was also complicated by
hypernatremia up to Na+ 160, resistant to treatment. MRI of the
brain was ordered, and showed among other findings increased
uptake in the pituitary stalk, concerning for pituitary
involvement with diabetes insipidus. MRI also significant for
multiple lesions in leptomeningeal and posterior parietal
compartments, involvement of cerebellum. Given possible
infectious process, it was decided that an LP should be done,
but because of risk of herniation pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
The patient states that he is overall doing well. He does have a
cough that is sometimes productive and feels SOB. He denies
recent fevers, chills, or night sweats. Denies specific pain. No
N/V. Has diarrhea but states that this is a chronic problem, no
[**Name2 (NI) **] or mucous. He does not feel confused.
Since he has been in [**Hospital1 18**], he has received Methotrexate x 2
days and last [**Hospital1 **] level today was 0.13 and high dose
dexamethasone  that has been tapered to 8mg Qday. He was also
diagnosed with b/l DVT and an IVC filter was placed.
During a routine CXR on [**2133-7-19**] he was found to have a fair
amount of pneumoperitoneum bellow the diaphragm, this study was
repeated on [**7-21**] and the findings  were unchanged. Of note this
was his first x-ray since his CT scan on [**7-8**] which was negative
for pneumoperitoneum. Today he denied abdominal pain,nausea,
emesis SOB, CP, night sweats chills or hematochezia. His last BM
was this am. However he complains of fatigue and weakness. He
had an ECHO in [**2133-5-26**] per report gross nl with mild left
ventricular hypertrophy and estimated EF of 60%.

MRI [**2133-7-6**]: There is a 1.5 x 1.4 cm area of abnormal signal
intensity, appears hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 and
FLAIR sequences, appears bright on diffusion-weighted sequence
with corresponding low ADC values. Diffuse homogeneous
enhancement is seen within the lesion on the postcontrast scans.
 There are multiple nodular and linear areas of leptomeningeal
enhancement in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, right parietal
cortex, and the optic chiasm. There is no hydrocephalus or
midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber
and configuration. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or
infarction is seen. Intracranial flow voids appear normal.
IMPRESSION: Nodular areas of enhancement seen in the right
periventricular
white matter and involving the optic chiasm. Multiple other
linear and
nodular areas of leptomeningeal enhancement are seen in
bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and in the right parietal lobe.
Given the clinical history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, imaging
findings suggest lymphomatous involvement of the CNS.

CT abdomen [**7-7**]: FINDINGS: A Port-A-Cath terminates in the
superior vena cava. Coronary artery calcifications are present.
A stent is present in the left anterior descending coronary
artery. The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There
is no pericardial effusion. An enlarged subcarinal lymph node
measures up to 22 x 16 mm in axial dimensions (3:27). A left
upper mediastinal lymph node measures 11 mm in diameter. A right
upper paratracheal lymph node measures 25 x 18 mm (3:14); an
adjacent one measures 8 mm. Small-to-moderate pleural effusion
is present on the right, free flowing and of low density. A
trace effusion is present on the left.
  In the left upper lobe, there is a large cavitating mass with
a thick
irregular enhancing rim. The lesion measures 73 x 52 mm in axial
dimensions and is contiguous with bronchovascular thickening
that tracks towards the hilum. The patient has mild-to-moderate
emphysema as well. An ill-defined nodule along the left major
fissure has a base measuring up to 13 mm with a height of 5 mm
(3:31). Mild interstitial changes are noted in the periphery of
the left lower lobe.
