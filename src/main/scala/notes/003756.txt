HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital
for interventional coronary catheterization.  A 48-year-old
male with past medical history with end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis, hepatitis C, coronary artery disease, status
post coronary artery bypass graft x2 vessels in [**2143-6-28**],
transferred from outside hospital for interventional
catheterization.  Admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2144-11-15**] with chest discomfort and dyspnea.  Had laboratories
there which showed a CK of 300, MB of 10, and troponin of 43.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
cardiac output of 8.7, wedge pressure 24, PA pressure of
65/30, a 70% stenosis in the left main coronary artery, and a
totally occluded left circumflex artery, right coronary
artery dominant system with 90% stenosis in the right
coronary artery at the bifurcation of the PDA and PL
branches.  The patient had [**Female First Name (un) 899**] to left anterior descending
artery graft and saphenous vein graft to OM-2 graft which
were patent.

The patient was then transferred for interventional cardiac
catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**] and
possible stent placement.  At catheterization at [**Hospital1 346**], the patient had a cardiac output of
3.5, a wedge pressure of 32, PA pressure of 78/36, right
coronary artery showed diffuse calcification, distal 90%
lesion at the bifurcation of the PDA/PL.  A stent was then
placed in the distal right coronary artery.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU for further care because he continued
to have searing 10/10 chest pain after stent placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic renal failure on hemodialysis on Monday,
Wednesday, Friday reportedly secondary to hypertension.
2. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient
continues to smoke one pack per day.
3. Hepatitis C, open sores secondary to pruritus.
4. Coronary artery disease.
5. History of flash pulmonary edema.
6. Hypertension.
7. Gastritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smoking greater than one pack per day.
History of intravenous drug abuse.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin leads to bleeding.  Norvasc leads to
unknown reaction.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Nitroglycerin.
2. Lasix unknown dose.

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.5, temperature max of 98.4,
heart rate 110-78, blood pressure 90-132/50-73.  Pulse
oximetry is 95-99% on room air.  Patient on a ReoPro drip 0.1
mcg/minute.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, deconditioned, belligerent
male verbally abuse.  Cardiovascular:  3/6 systolic murmur at
the precordium, regular, rate, and rhythm.  Patient refused
rest of the examination.

INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count is 7.2,
hematocrit 29.3, platelets 163, 88% neutrophils, 5.1%
lymphocytes, INR 1.3.  Chem-7:  Sodium 130, potassium 5.3,
chloride of 98, bicarb of 25, BUN of 45, creatinine 5.2,
glucose of 118, magnesium of 2.0.  CPK of 45, AST 17, ALT 6,
alkaline phosphatase 281.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  A 48-year-old male with a past medical
history of end-stage renal disease, hepatitis C, substance
abuse, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft x2 here in CCU after a successful stent
placement to the distal right coronary artery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was extremely combative initially
during hospital course, and he required several doses of
Haldol 5 mg IV as well as Ativan.  Patient slept only
intermittently requested to leave the hospital to smoke
cigarettes.  Extremely belligerant to team.  Finally
requesting to sign out against medical advice.  The patient
refused his morning dialysis, assisted in signing out.  The
patient underwent an extensive discussion with the medical
team, and understood that he was at risk at sudden cardiac
death, congestive heart failure, and complications leading to
skipping dialysis.  All of this was discussed in detail.  He
remained adamant upon leaving.

We spoke to his nephew, who then spoke to the patient.
Patient continued to refuse to remain in the hospital, and
insisted on signing out against medical advice, which the
patient eventually did.

A phone call was placed to his local pharmacy to have Plavix
prescription filled for the patient, and his wife was
[**Name (NI) 653**] and the importance of taking the Plavix as he had a
recent stent placement was stressed.
