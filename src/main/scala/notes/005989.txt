HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 108541**] is a
62-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer status post
surgery and XRT in [**2089**] status post radical resection in
[**2103-3-7**], atrial fibrillation and flutter, status post
failed ablation in [**2104**] who presented to the Emergency Room
on [**2105-4-13**] with shortness of breath and cough.  She was
treated as an outpatient for a right middle lobe and right
lower lobe pneumonia with Amoxicillin but presented to the
Emergency Room with worsening symptoms as described above.
She reported no chest pain, no headache, photophobia, neck
stiffness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or any other
symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Atrial fibrillation/flutter status
post incomplete ablation in [**6-6**], status post DC
cardioversion in [**2104-7-6**].  Congestive heart failure with an
EF of 63%.  2) Rheumatoid arthritis.   3) Pyoderma
gangrenosum.  4) Horner's syndrome.  5) Left sided breast
cancer status post surgery and XRT in [**2089**] and status post
radical resection in [**2103**].  6) Question metastatic lesion to
the left femur.  7) HSV on left side.  8) Possible lung
cancer of the right lower lobe status post resection in [**2101**].
9) History of MRSA foot infection.  10) Recently diagnosed
vertebral compression fractures.  11) Superficial cutaneous
Mycobacterium infection undergoing treatment with Cipro and
Clindamycin.

ALLERGIES:  Patient is allergic to Bactrim, Percocet,
Doxycycline.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Aldactone 25 mg a day, Calcitonin
q day, Fentanyl patch, Lasix 40 mg q day, Lopressor 50 mg
tid, Naprosyn 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Nystatin swish and swallow,
OxyContin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **], Potassium Chloride 20 a day, Prednisone
4 a day, Ultram prn, Tylenol #3 prn, Vicodin prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker with a 15
pack year history.  She quit smoking five years ago.  She
states that she has [**2-8**] glasses of wine per day.  She is
married and a 6th grade teacher.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to the Emergency Room
the patient was afebrile and had a room air O2 sat of 97%.
She was hemodynamically stable.  Physical examination was
most significant for right sided crackles.  Chest x-ray on
admission significant for right middle lobe and right lower
lobe pneumonia which appeared worsened compared to the first
chest x-ray taken a week prior.  The patient was admitted to
the floor for treatment of what was presumed to be community
acquired pneumonia, now failing oral antibiotic treatment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's respiratory status worsened
with increasing oxygen requirements.  The infiltrate in the
right middle lobe and right lower lobe appeared to worsen
radiographically, now encompassing the entire right lung
field and the hilar sections of the left lung field.  This
was presumed to be infectious as the patient had continued
fevers, elevated white count and had cough and sputum
production.  ID service was consulted given the patient's
relatively immunocompromised state as she was on Prednisone
for her rheumatoid arthritis and given the fact that she had
a mycobacterial infection on her right forearm which had not
been completely treated with oral antibiotics.  She was
treated quite broadly with antibiotics including Vancomycin,
Imipenem, Tobramycin and Gatifloxacin.  She was transferred
on [**2105-4-17**] to the Medical Intensive Care Unit as her
oxygenation worsened.  Initially she expressed very clearly
that she did not want to be intubated or resuscitated for any
reason at all, however, it was felt that her worsening lung
process was likely infectious and likely to get better with
antibiotic treatment and given this bit of information, she
consented to be intubated for hypoxemia and also for a
bronchoscopy which was performed on [**2105-4-18**].  Samples were
taken including fungal AFB, routine bacterial and viral
cultures, all of which yielded no specific pathogen.  She had
poor urine output initially which was somewhat responsive to
fluid boluses but became unresponsive to fluid boluses.  At
that point she was about 5-6 liters positive and diuresis was
attempted as she had difficulty coming off of the ventilator
and was still requiring FIO2 of 60%, PEEP of 10.  The
patient's oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
appeared to worsen and on [**2105-4-21**] the patient was noted to be
in rapid atrial fibrillation and had large ST elevations in
the lateral leads.  The next morning she had a troponin of
12.  Given her ICU course which was becoming more and more
prolonged and the poor prognosis overall, the patient's
husband, the health care proxy, decided to withdraw all
aggressive care.  She was made comfort measures only, was
placed on a Morphine drip and passed away on [**2105-4-22**].  An
autopsy was declined by the husband, health care proxy.
