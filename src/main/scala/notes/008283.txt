History of Present Illness:
65 y/o female s/p Aortic Valve Replacement (mechanical) on
[**2138-1-23**] who been followed by routine echo's who has noticed
decreased exercise tolerance with dyspnea on exertion. Along
with chest tightness with exertion over the past 6 months. Also
had an episode of CHF with hospital admission in [**7-31**] and
following caridac cath in [**1-29**]. Most recent echo revealed severe
prosthetic valve AS. Cath confirmed AS and revealed a dilated
Ascending aorta. CT was then done and showed a 4.9 x 5.3cm
ascending aorta.  She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-25**] for
anticoagulation with heparin, after holding her coumadin, for a
planned AVR and ascending aortic replacement on [**3-28**].

Pertinent Results:
Carotid U/S [**3-26**]: Normal carotid study.
Echo [**3-28**]: Prebypass: There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal(LVEF>55%). The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Post Bypass: LV and RV function somewhat
depressed EF 45 %. Mechanical valve seen in the aortic position.
Leaflets move well and the valve is well seated. Trace aortic
regurgitation present. Trace mitral regurgitation present.
CXR [**3-30**]: Enlargement of the postoperative cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable since [**3-29**], pulmonary vascular engorgement
persists but consolidation at the right lung base has improved.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or indication of
pneumothorax. Right internal jugular vascular introducer tip
projects over the brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20915**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-25**] in order to start a
heparin drip for anticoagulation after discontinuing coumadin,
prior to surgery.  On [**3-28**] she underwent an elective redo AVR and
ascending aortic replacement, which she tolerated well (see Op
Note).  Post-operatively, she was transferred to the cardiac
intensive care unit in stable condition.  She was weaned from
vasopressor support, extubated without event, and transferred
out of the cardiac intensive care unit to the floor.  She would
remain in stable condition throughout her hospital course.  She
was restarted on coumadin, and also a heparin drip until
therapeutic on heparin.  She was soon out of bed and ambulating.
 Her wound appeared to be healing well throughout her hospital
course, and her sternum exhibited no signs of instability.  With
her INR at 2.0, and on a 3 mg/day dose of Coumadin, she was
discharged in good condition.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] within the next month for post-operative evaluation.
