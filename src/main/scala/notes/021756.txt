Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
gaze preference and not talking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83 yo man with right parietal SDH x 1 yr, afib on coumadin
subtheraputic, stroke [**2167-7-10**] right precentral gyrus with
residual left UE> LE weakness, who presents to OSH nonverbal and
left gaze preference since 11am on day prior to admission here.
OSH head ct showed increased SDH. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
neurosurg backup. Here, thought to be having sz given inability
to communicate, left eye gaze preference, and increased SDH on
CT. Given ativan 1mg x 2, loaded with dilantin.  Given 2 u FFP
and vit K for INR reversal (INR 1.7).  Became less
responsive around 2am, neg gag reflex -> intubated.  MRI
obtained which showed multiple areas of new stroke in the
inferior MCA territory, right mca/pca watershed area, a new one
in the CBL. Admitted to ICU.

TTE [**2167-8-12**]:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function
appears mildly depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include
inferior and inferolateral severe hypokinesis/akinesis with
hypokinesis
elsewhere. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There may be mild aortic stenosis
(gradient
measurement is technically suboptimal). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated
anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2166-6-2**], left
ventricular systolic function now appears slightly less vigorous
and
segemental wall motion abnormality is now visualized (may have
been present
previously but views were technically suboptimal). Mitral
regurgitation is now
more prominent.

Head CT [**8-10**]:  Slight interval increase in size of right
parietal subdural hematoma since the prior study. No evidence of
shift of the normally midline structures. Interval posterior
fight frontal infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
This man is a very unfortunate man with atrial fibrillation not
theraputic on coumadin who presented with worsening subdural
hematoma as well as multiple new strokes specifically in the
inferior MCA territory, right mca/pca watershed area, and the
left CBL. Complicating this picture, he ruled in for myocardial
infarction and on TTE had multiple areas of akinesis.  His 1st
right big toe was purple and cold upon admission.  Our therory
was that he was likely throwing clots all over his body from his
afib.  Treatment was difficult in that treating the strokes with
anticoagulation would worsen the subdural hematoma, potentially
requiring surgical evacuation.  This tough treatment decision
was explained to the patient's family through multiple phone
conversations.  Their schedules did not permit them to meet with
us during hours we were available.  Given his poor quality of
life and multiple organ involvement, the patients 3 children
came to the decision to make him comfort measures only.  He was
extubated, placed on a morphine drip for air hunger, and died at
2:03 am on [**2167-8-16**].  The family denied postmortem exam.
