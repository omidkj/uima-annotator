History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86-yo cantonese speaking male who presents
from his nursing home after an episode ofacute shorntess of
breath and neurological changes. He has chronic lung disease on
home 2L nc home o2. Vitals on the scene were hr 100, bp 119/68
and o2 83 on 2L.  Glucose 173. According to the Neurology
consult service who spoke with the NH, "he was seen walking the
halls around 8:30am, and was noted to be able to eat his
breakfast without difficulty. He then went back to his room
where they helped him shower and shave and he went back to bed.
Somewhere between 10:30 and 11am he was found in his room,
lethargic and 'grey'. He was found at that time to have an SaO2
of 83% on 2L NC, which only improved to 91% with 5L NC. He was
also tachypnic to 22, hypotensive to 80/50 and tachycardic to
110." A cantonese speaking nurse reported that he "was slow to
respond, and was soft spoken, but was able to provide
appropriate responses."
.
On arrival to the ED he was hypoxic to 88% on RA and his
systolic pressure in 80s. He was noted to be minimally
responsive, with a question of possible decreased movement on
his right side. A code stroke was called.
.
A CTA of the head and neck and a CT brain perfusion were
negative. He was persistently hypotensive and a central line was
placed and norepi started. A formal ECHO did was not concerning
for cardiogenic shock or right heart strain so a CTA was not
obtained for r/o PE. He was treated with vanc and zosyn for PNA
but vanc was stopped for red man syndrome.
.
On arrival, his son was interviewed with the interpreter. Per
the son, in the several days prior he had been complaining of
palpitations. However, when asked if he had chest pain, the son
stated that he actually had chest pain and not palpitations. The
son denies any cough or increased sputum.

CT/CTA Head/Neck:
FINDINGS:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
large areas of edema, large masses, or mass effect. There is
preservation of normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with
age-related parenchymal atrophy. Incidental note is made of
cavum septum pellucidum, et vergae variant. The paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear, although there is
under-pneumatization of the left mastoid air cells. Soft tissues
of the orbits are within normal limits.

CT PERFUSION: The mean transit time, cerebral blood flow, and
cerebral blood volume are within normal limits with no evidence
of perfusion abnormality to suggest infarct.

CTA HEAD: There is prominent calcified atherosclerotic disease
of the
cavernous portion of the left internal carotid artery likely
causing some
degree of narrowing, although the full extent is difficult to
appreciate given the extensive calcification. Milder calcified
atherosclerotic disease is noted of the right cavernous ICA.
Otherwise, there are no areas of significant stenosis,
occlusion, or aneurysm formation measuring more than 2 mm. There
is also calcified atherosclerotic disease of the intracranial
portion of the vertebral arteries bilaterally without
significant stenosis.

CTA NECK: There is extensive severe atherosclerotic disease with
diffuse
areas of ulcerative plaque noted within the aortic arch, similar
in appearance to the CTA chest of [**2172-6-29**]. Extensive
atherosclerotic disease causes severe stenosis at the origin of
the left common carotid artery and also severe stenosis at the
origin of the left subclavian artery.  The right common carotid
artery demonstrates calcified atherosclerotic disease proximally
but without significant stenosis.  The right cervical internal
carotid artery demonstrates a minimal diameter of
7.0 mm proximally and 4.0 mm distally. The left cervical ICA
demonstrates a minimal diameter of 6.5 mm proximally and 3.5 mm
distally.

The proximal left vertebral artery is occluded. There is poor
reconstitution within the mid left vertebral artery, although
adequate flow is seen in the distal artery beginning around the
level of vertebral body C3. However, the direction of flow
cannot be assessed on CTA.

CT Chest
There is severe emphysema. Patchy opacities are noted within the
left upper lobe concerning for aspiration and/or pneumonia.
Although not visualized on the axial CT portion, the coronal
scout image also demonstrates areas of patchy opacity in the mid
right lung.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. No areas of perfusion
abnormality to
suggest infarct.
2. Severe extensive atherosclerotic disease with diffuse
ulcerative plaque
within the aortic arch extending to the proximal great vessels
with severe
stenosis at the origin of the left common carotid artery and
severe stenosis at the origin of the left subclavian artery. The
proximal left vertebral artery is occluded but reconstitutes
fully distally at the level of the vertebral body C3. The
direction of flow cannot be determined on CTA. There is also
narrowing of the origin of the right vertebral artery.
3. Extensive calcified plaque of the cavernous portion of the
left ICA with some degree of narrowing. However, it is difficult
to characterize the degree of stenosis due to the extent of the
calcification.
4. Severe emphysema with patchy opacities in the visualized left
upper lobe and right mid lung, concerning for pneumonia and/or
aspiration. Please refer to same day chest x-ray for further
details.
