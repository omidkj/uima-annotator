Pertinent Results:
CATH [**2124-3-10**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant system with three vessel CAD. The LMCA was calcified
but otherwise had no angiographic evidence of CAD. The LAD had
mild diffuse disease with 60% in-stent restenosis.  The D1
branch had an ostial 90% stenosis. The LCx was non dominant with
a total occlusion of the OM3 branch. This was filled by
collaterals from the LAD. The RCA had 60% before and after the
previously placed stent. 2. Left ventriculography revealed a
normal ejection fraction without evidence of mitral
regurgitation. 3. Limited hemodynamics revealed severe central
aortic systolic hypertension. There was no gradient on pull-back
of the catheter from the LV to the aorta.
[**2124-3-26**] CXR: Increased left basilar atelectasis and slight
worsening of fluid status versus prior.
[**2124-3-22**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound
The deep vessels of both lower extremities show normal
compressibility, augmentation and respiratory variation. There
is no evidence of above knee deep venous thrombosis on either
side.
[**2124-3-13**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-BYPASS: Preserved biventricular systolic function. Aortic
insufficiency is the same. Ascending aorta is free of any
dissection.
[**2124-3-13**] EKG
Regular atrial paced rhythm. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-3-10**] these
changes are new.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 65107**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-3-9**] for a cardiac
catheterization. As this was significant for severe three vessel
disease, she was kept in the hospital and the cardiac surgical
service was consulted. She was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner and deemed suitable for surgery. A dental
consult was obtained and she was cleared for surgery from a oral
standpoint. A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which
showed no significant internal carotid artery stenosis. On
[**2124-3-13**], Ms. [**Known lastname 65107**] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 65107**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin, beta
blockade and Plavix were resumed. On postoperative day two, she
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She
was gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. A swallow
evaluation was performed as Ms. [**Known lastname 65107**] was noted to cough with
drinking water. No evidence of aspiration was found via a
bedside swallowing exam and Ms. [**Known lastname 65107**] was cleared to eat. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility. She was transfused for
postoperative anemia. Ms. [**Known lastname 65107**] developed serous sternal
drainage and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycin
prophylactically. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 387**] diabetes consult was obtained for
assistance with her diabetes medication management as her blood
sugars were elevated. Changes were made to her medications and
her blood sugars improved. The swallow service returned as Ms.
[**Known lastname 65107**] was having difficulty swallowing pills as well as some
emesis with taking medications. Crushing of pills was
recommended no evidence of aspiration was noted. GI service was
consulted and recommended EGD and colonoscopy, but patient
started to eat full meals on post-op day #9 with no nausea and
vomiting. She will follow-up with GI as an outpatient. Ms.
[**Known lastname 65107**] also had some LLE cellulitis at her vein puncture site
and was observed and treated. On post-op day nine she had an 8
beat run of NS VT which was treated with 2g magnesium. Following
this event she had no further episodes. Patient slowly improved
with no other incident's and appeared suitable for discharge to
home on post-op day #15. She will follow-up with the appropriate
physicians as an outpatient.
