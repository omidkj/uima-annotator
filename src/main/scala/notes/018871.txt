Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and
hypotension; ?gram positive bacteremia; transfer from outside
hospital.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40612**] is a 66-year old male with a history of hypertension,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents from an OSH with
unstable angina.  Says that two days prior to admission to
outside hospital, he awoke from sleep with chills and shivering.
 He woke up and took Motrin which improved his chills.  The
following morning, he went out for an hour long walk without any
dyspnea on exertion.  On night prior to admission to OSH, he
again woke from sleep with chills and subjective coldness.  This
time he also had SOB.  He called an ambulance and was admitted
to [**Hospital6 63271**].
.
At OSH, his vitals were T 102.4, HR 90, RR 24, BP 99/59, O2 sat
92% RA.  He was noted to have pna on CXR.  EKG showed AF but no
ischemic changes.  He was also noted to have an 18 beat run of
VT in the ED that spontaneously converted.  He denied chest
pain, palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness.
.
He was admitted to the ICU.  Cardiac enzymes were drawn and
found to peak at 4.26 with CK 345 (downtrending to 3.12 and 288
at time of transfer).  His BNP was 46.  Also notable was a
bandemia to 17% on a WBC of 3.9.  He received lopressor 5 mg for
atrial fibrillation with rates to 160s.  A blood culture showed
GPCs in [**12-30**] blood cultures with speciation still pending at time
of transfer.  TTE was done that showed EF 20%, down from >55%
two years ago.  At OSH, he was seen by a cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 13224**] [**Doctor Last Name **], who recommended that he be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
where he receives his primary care.  At time of transfer, his
cardiovascular meds included carvedilol 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **], coumadin,
lisinopril 10mg, spironolactone 25 mg, digoxin 0.125 mg and
Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was asymptomatic.  He denied fevers,
chills, cough, sputum production, chest pain, palps or
lightheadedness.  Said that he has no h/o anginal type symptoms,
that he walks about 3 miles per day without difficulty prior to
this episode.

MICROBIOLOGY:
BLOOD CULTURES:  negative x3
URINE CULTURE:  negative
..
STUDIES:
.
CXR:  FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or
effusion. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
unremarkable. The visualized osseous and soft tissue structures
are normal.
IMPRESSION: There is no radiological evidence of pneumonia.
.
EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with HR 130s.  No ST-T changes or TWI.
.
TELEMETRY:  As above, irregularly irregular, rate in 130s.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**8-1**]):
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
..
2D- ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2164-8-29**]):  PER OUTSIDE HOSPITAL RECORD
LV dilitation with diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with EF
20%, biatrial enlargement, mild to moderate MR.
..
TRANS-THORACIC ECHO ([**2164-8-31**]):
The atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (consistent with
tachycardia, toxic, metabolic process, etc.; LVEF = 45-50%).
Precise LV systolic function quantification is difficult because
of tachycardia. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global
systolic dysfunction. Dilated right ventricle with mild global
systolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-8-11**],
tachycardia and mild LV dysfunction are new. The other findings
are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 66-year old man with a history of
hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents
from OSH with elevated troponins in setting of AF with RVR,
fevers, and question of gram positive cocci bacteremia.
