HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 23-year-old male with
a history of type I diabetes for over 20 years, hypertension,
cardiopathy, chronic kidney disease who was hospitalized here
about one month ago for diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient at
that time had a creatinine of 8.1 and a BUN of 116.  Patient
has never been dialyzed, but preparations to start have been
ongoing in the past month.

In the interim, liver donor for renal transplant is also
being worked up.  Patient has been on Lasix 80 mg po b.i.d.
and Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg po q.d. with initial weight and lower
extremity edema decreasing, but over the past three to four
days, the patient has had increasing lower extremity edema.

Patient was feeling well until the night prior to admission
when he was noted to have a non-productive cough over the
past few days and awoke with severe dyspnea on the morning of
admission.  The patient denies sore throat, chills, fever,
diarrhea, hematuria, abdominal pain.  The patient did vomit
without hematemesis.

The patient took his Lasix and Zaroxolyn medication, however,
in the Emergency Room he was also given an additional 80 mg
intravenous of Lasix and 2.5 mg po Zaroxolyn, as well as his
antihypertensive medicines.  Patient was also given
Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous and Zithromax 500 mg po q.d.
In addition, he was given a subsequent dose of Lasix 40 mg
intravenously.  He had a chest x-ray that was consistent with
a pneumonia.

PTT 25.2, sodium 131, potassium 3.9, chloride 88, bicarbonate

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Patient with good
ventilation, but hypoxia.  Patient was placed on supplemental
oxygen and initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  Patient's respiratory failure was ascribed to volume
overload with congestive heart failure, probably a
combination of known decreased ejection fraction plus
worsening renal failure.  In addition, the patient had a left
lower lobe infiltrate on his chest x-ray and history of a dry
cough.  This was treated with Ceftriaxone and azithromycin
while in the Intensive Care Unit.  Patient was gradually less
hypoxic and was taken off his supplemental oxygen after being
treated with antibiotics and aggressive diuresis.  Patient
had a follow-up chest x-ray on [**4-9**] that showed marked
resolution of his bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and
congestive heart failure.  He had some residual small
bilateral pleural effusions and small atelectasis at the left
base, but resolution of the previously seen right lower lobe
infiltrate.

2.  Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was initially on an
insulin drip without any clear evidence for diabetic
ketoacidosis.  He was then changed to subcutaneous insulin
and after [**Last Name (un) **] Consult was obtained, patient was changed to
his home dose glargine at 20 units in the morning and a
carefully titrated Humalog sliding scale.  Subsequently, he
had initially excellent glycemic control with blood sugars
ranging from 54 to 209, however, on the next hospital day,
the patient had an episode of hypoglycemia with a fingerstick
of 16, as well as elevated blood sugars in the setting of a
strict Humalog sliding scale and glargine while patient
unable to tolerate a full diet and mild emesis.  Patient's
sliding scale was adjusted [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations and
eventually patient was placed on his home dose glargine and
as an outpatient will only continue on carbohydrate counting.

3.  Hypertension:  Patient had blood pressures controlled
with his home dose regimen including labetalol, hydralazine,
Isordil and Norvasc.  Patient's blood pressures ran anywhere
between mostly 120s to 150s during his hospital admission.

4.  Renal:  End stage kidney disease:  Patient had evidence
of volume overload, but no acute indications for
hemodialysis.  The patient had a PD catheter placed by
Transplant Surgery.  Subsequent to this, he had considerable
pain that required multiple doses of intravenous morphine
which was then switched to Percocet for his outpatient
regimen.  Patient will have peritoneal Dialysis initiated in
the next three to four weeks as an outpatient.  Patient will
have further evaluation for transplant as an outpatient.
Patient was placed on increasing EPO doses at 10,000 units
subcutaneously twice a week.  He was initially on amphojel,
calcium carbonate and calcium acetate while in the Intensive
Care Unit and this was switched to calcium acetate 2 tablets
t.i.d. with meals and calcium carbonate 500 mg t.i.d. after
meals.  Patient was also started on iron polysaccharide
complex.  Patient's diuresis was maintained on Zaroxolyn 2.5
mg po q.d. with Lasix 80 mg po b.i.d. which is a double units
dose of Lasix from admission.

DISPOSITION:  Patient will follow-up in [**Hospital **] Clinic and
will call for an appointment as per his usual regimen.
Patient has an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**] in Renal on
[**2155-4-15**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure secondary to volume overload and
decreased ejection fraction.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  End stage renal disease; to start perineal Dialysis in
the next two weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please resume all home medications
with the following changes:
1.  Reglan decreased to 5 mg po q.i.d.
2.  EPO increase to 10,000 units biweekly.
3.  Lasix increase from 80 mg q.d. to 80 mg b.i.d.
4.  Addition of iron.
5.  Calcium acetate 2 tablets t.i.d. with meals and calcium
carbonate 500 mg tablets t.i.d. after meals.
6.  Percocet total of 8 tablets to be
