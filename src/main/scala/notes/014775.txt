Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent TTP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Plasmapheresis
Subclavian line placement for pheresis

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 25 y/o woman with history of recurrent TTP who now
presents with signs/symptoms suggestive of TTP. Her symptoms
began about 2 weeks ago when she noticed increased bruising. She
sought evaluation and blood work revealed hematocrit of 36% and
platelet count lower than her baseline at 190K. She then
developed increased petechiae and ecchymoses and reevaluation
revealed a hematocrit of 33% and thrombocytopenia of 90K/uL. She
was thus referred to ED for urgent plasmapharesis. She has been
undergoing therapy with Clindamycin for a dental infection for
the past 3 weeks and is due to have a tooth extracted on [**7-19**]. Currently she denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, headaches, dysuria, decreased urine output. She does
report some mild mental status changes which her mother
confirms. These were present during her prior TTP as well.  She
would forget her place while speaking. Very subtle changes.
.
She was diagnosed originally in [**5-30**], had ADAMTS 13 inhibitor
documented and required plasmapheresis. She had recurrent TTP in
[**8-30**] again requiring plasmapheresis. Her previous pheresis
sessions have been complicated by allergic reactions with
diffuse hives as well as anaphylaxis on one occassion requiring
epinephrine. She now undergoes pre-treatment with hydrocortisone
200mg IV, benadryl 50 mg iv Q 6 and Famotidine prior to
pheresis.

Brief Hospital Course:
25yo woman with h/o TTP with ADAMSTS 13 inhibitor presented with
hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and mental status changes
consistent with recurrence of TTP. Patient has known known TTP
and ADAMSTS inhibitor. She presented with c/o bruising, fatigue
and thrombocytopenia, which is how she presented in the past. A
subclavian line was placed for plasmapheresis. She was initially
admitted to the MICU for closer monitoring in the setting of
anaphylactic reactions to pheresis sessions, and tolerated two
sessions well without any complications. She was premedicated
with hydrocortisone, Benadryl, and famotidine. Patient was then
transferred to the floor for further pheresis. Daily hemolysis
labs were monitored and did not show signs of continued
hemolysis. She was initially on hydrocortisone q8h, and
transitioned to prednisone 60 mg daily at the end of her
pheresis sessions. She was noted at her final pheresis session
to have wheezing, eye swelling, and hives, consistent with her
prior anaphylactic reactions. She received benadryl,
hydrocortisone, and famotidine, and did well. She was kept for
further monitoring, and had no further episodes. Her hematocrit
and platelet count were both stable at time of discharge. Her
subclavian central line was removed prior to discharge. She will
follow up with her primary care doctor and her hematologist as
an outpatient.
.
Patient was continued on her home medications for her asthma and
allergic rhinitis. For her dental infection, she was continued
on her clindamycin. She is scheduled for tooth extraction later
in the month. Patient was discharged to home for follow up with
her hematologist.

She had been on fosamax as outpatient when on steroids . We told
her not to take this anymore as no studies on long term effects
in young patients.

She will have have CBC checked in 2 days.

She has numerous autoantibodies though clinically doesn't have
SLE or any other autoimmune disease.  Consider rheumatology
follow up.
