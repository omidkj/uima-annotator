Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for cerebellar bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

CT head
MRI/A head


History of Present Illness:
HPI:  [**Age over 90 **] yo woman on coumadin for MI, "minor stroke in past" who
became acutely nauseous and dizzy (spinning sensation) at 4pm
today after doing lots of housework (moving winter clothes in
boxes up stairs). She laid down to take a nap, was still
symptomatic, unable to arise from bed, so called 911.  She was
taken to [**Hospital3 5365**] and given aspirin, then head CT was
performed and showed a left cerebellar hemorrhage. Had episode
of
emesis at OSH. Transferred here for further care.

Here, patient is a little sleepy, but just states the above
information about nausea/dizziness/emesis.  She currently is
asymptomatic, no headache, visual changes, numbness or weakness.

On ROS, she may have had some diarrhea day before yesterday but
denies this now.  No fevers, chills, illnesses, chest pain, SOB,
belly pain, dysuria or other symptoms.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT [**2142-6-1**]: There is hemorrhage seen within the
left cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding low attenuation
consistent with edema. Hemorrhage is also seen within the third
and fourth ventricle, and extending anterior to the cerebral
hemispheres. The ventricles are prominent, but part of this
could be due to age-related atrophy. There is low attenuation of
the periventricular white matter. This is likely secondary to
chronic microvascular ischemia, as opposed to transependymal
edema. There is low attenuation in the right caudate nucleus
consistent with a lacunar infarct. The sulci do not appear
effaced. There is preservation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation of the cerebral hemispheres. There is no
evidence of infarction. There is no evidence of shift of
normally midline structures or definite uncal herniation at this
time. There are no fractures. The sinuses are well aerated.
Cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage with hemorrhage in the third
and fourth ventricles.
Conclusion: Left cerebellar hematoma and intraventricular
hemorrhage. The differential diagnosis includes a hemorrhagic
cerebellar neoplasm, an aneurysm, perhaps arising from the PICA,
an arteriovenous malformation, or hypertension.

MRI HEAD [**2142-6-2**]:A left-sided cerebellar hemorrhage is
identified with indentation and deformity of the fourth
ventricle and mild surrounding edema. On diffusion images, no
evidence of acute infarct is identified. Following gadolinium,
no evidence of abnormal enhancement is seen. There is moderate
prominence of sulci and moderate prominence of ventricles.
Fluid, fluid levels are identified in both lateral ventricles
indicating small amount of hemorrhage. There is also moderate
dilatation of the temporal horns. Moderate periventricular
changes of small vessel disease are identified. Following
gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal vascular or
meningeal enhancement is noted.
IMPRESSION: Left cerebellar hemorrhage without evidence of
abnormal enhancement or vascular structures in the area.
Moderate ventriculomegaly with fluid, fluid levels in the
ventricles indicating small amount of intraventricular blood.
Moderate changes of small vessel disease. No evidence of acute
infarct.

MRA OF THE HEAD [**2142-6-2**]:
The head MRA demonstrates mild atherosclerotic disease involving
both supraclinoid internal carotid arteries without evidence of
high-grade stenosis or occlusion. A hypoplastic A1 segment of
the left anterior cerebral artery is incidentally noted.
IMPRESSION: No abnormalities on the MRA of t
