Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2146-3-7**]
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
[**1-15**]+ TR.
POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
No AI is visualized. The remaining study is unchanged from
prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
Operating Room on [**2146-3-7**] where she underwent aortic valve
replacement with a 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue valve, along with Talon
plating for closure.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition, intubated, requiring pressors to optimize
her cardiac function. POD#1 she awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without difficulty. Pressors were weaned off.
Beta-Blocker/Statin/aspirin/diuretics were initiated. All lines
and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion. Her creatinine
rose to 1.5 (from her baseline of 0.8) on POD 2. Diuretic doses
were decreased and her creatnine function improved to her
baseline. Postoperatively she experienced paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She was started on anticoagulation with Coumadin
for her arrhythmia. POD#3 she was transferred to the step down
unit for further  monitoring. Physical therapy was consulted for
evaluation of strength and mobility. She continued to progress
and was cleared for discharge to home on POD#6. INR/Coumadin
dosing to be foloowed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. All follow up appointments
were advised.
