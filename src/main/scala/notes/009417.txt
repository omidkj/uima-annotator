LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  From [**2151-9-3**] when he was
admitted WBC of 4.4, hematocrit of 36.0, platelets 61. Given
platelets prior to operating room. PT 15.4, 38.7, INR 1.6.
Sodium 132, 4.6, 95, bicarb 30, BUN/creatinine 10/0.7,
glucose 230. ALT 30, AST 48, alk phos 171, total bilirubin
10.8.

Patient went to the operating room on [**2151-9-3**] in
which patient had a preoperative diagnosis of Laennec's
cirrhosis, portal hypertension, ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, splenomegaly. Postoperative patient had an
orthotropic deceased donor liver transplant (piggyback-portal
vein anastomosis-common bile duct. No T tube). Replaced right
hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery recipient
(common hepatic artery donor) performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 30564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30565**]. Please see details of
operative note from [**2151-9-3**]. Postoperatively
patient went to the Intensive Care Unit intubated, sedated.
Patient had an internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter placed. X-
ray was obtained demonstrating no pneumothorax interval
development of mild congestive heart failure/fluid overload.
Ultrasound was performed on [**2151-9-4**], postoperative
day 1, demonstrating normal color flow and wave forms within
the vasculature of the transplanted liver. No biliary
dilatations. No perihepatic fluid collections. Questionable
slight heterogenicity of the architecture of the liver
posteriorly within the right lobe. Finding may be artificial
and could be re-evaluated. Repeat ultrasonography with
radiologist present.

Postoperative day 2 patient intubated on CPAP. Good ins and
outs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains intact. Minimal trace peripheral
edema. Patient was on MMF, Solu-Medrol 150 q day and
tacrolimus 2 and 2. On [**2151-9-6**] patient had a line
change. Chest x-ray was obtained worsening mild congestive
heart failure with new moderate size right sided pleural
effusion. Patient was status post extubation. Central venous
line in appropriate position. No pneumothorax. On [**2151-9-6**] patient continued to be in surgical intensive care
unit, extubated. Vital signs stable. CVP was 14. Ins and
outs. Lungs were mildly coarse. Abdomen distended, hypoactive
bowel sounds. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains which were both
serosanguineous. Laboratories on [**2151-9-6**]: WBC 5.8,
hematocrit of 32.2, platelets 75. PT 13.2, INR 1.2, PTT 24.9.
Sodium 137, 3.8, 102, 29, 16, 0.8, blood sugar 172, total
bilirubin 4.1, AST 251, ALT 471, alkaline phosphatase 78,
amylase 16. Finger sticks have been in the range of 90s to
150s. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and they made appropriate
recommendations.

Physical therapy, occupational therapy were consulted.
Patient transferred from the unit to Far 10 on [**2151-9-9**]. Blood sugars were elevated. Afebrile, vital signs
stable. Liver function tests were slightly elevated.
Ultrasound was performed demonstrating that there was patent
hepatic and portal veins. Patency of the hepatic arteries are
identified and the resistive indices appear slightly
increased in comparison to the previous examination. Because
the ultrasound from [**2151-9-9**] was indefinite in
diagnosis and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
was obtained to evaluate for biliary leak and with impression
demonstrated mild narrowing at the biliary anastomosis
without evidence of biliary duct dilatation. No evidence of
biliary leak. Successful placement of plastic stent in the
common bile duct across the anastomosis. On [**2151-9-9**] an ultrasound was done that evening demonstrating stable
Doppler ultrasound examination of the liver with patent
hepatic and portal veins. Hepatic arteries again show
slightly increased resistive indices.

On [**2151-9-12**] it was discussed and decided to have CT
of abdomen and pelvis because of resistive arterial indices
on ultrasound. Findings state that there was patent hepatic
arterial flow without evidence for focal stenosis. The portal
venous and hepatic venous flows unremarkable. 2) Presence of
splenomegaly and extensive collaterals consistent with portal
hypertension. Inflammatory stranding in the right
subcutaneous tissue of uncertain clinical significance which
was related by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30566**]. On [**2151-9-13**] overnight the patient complained of chest pressure.
Electrocardiogram was obtained. Enzymes were obtained.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm, prolonged QT
interval. Troponin levels were less than 0.01. Chest pressure
improved. Patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
Patient was discontinued on telemetry.

Patient has been eating well, ambulating well without chest
pain. Patient continued on tacrolimus, MMF and patient was
weaned to prednisone 20 mg q day. On [**2151-9-15**]
patient was doing well, WBC of 4.5, hematocrit 29.4,
platelets 94. PT 13.1, PTT 23.1, INR 1.1. Sodium 136, 3.6,
97, 31, BUN/creatinine 27/1.6, glucose 107, ALT 88, AST 16,
alkaline phosphatase 106, total bilirubin 1.4. Patient's FTA
level on [**2151-9-15**] was 12.4 on 5 and 5. Patient is
being discharged home with [**Hospital6 407**] with no
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains. Both [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains were removed
in the last two days that patient was hospitalized. Patient
