Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, persistent fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- mechanical ventilation
- bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o F  with PMH of CAD s/p multiple PCIs (at least 9 DESs
placed in 8 separate PCIs since [**2118**]), paroxysmal AFib (on
warfarin), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of
pericarditis, severe RA (on prednisone 5, leflunomide,
remicaide), GERD, pulmonary fibrosis (but FVC 76% of predicted
in [**2121**] with DLCO 65% of predicted), and other issues, admitted
to OSH on [**2126-11-12**].  Initially presented with flu-like symptoms
and a subjective fever for about one week.  In the ED there, CXR
showed baseline interstitial pattern and possible right basilar
infiltrate.  She was noted to have  a'red hot' leg in the ED,
but no obvious joint effusion.  In the ED, she spiked a fever to
102.8, persisting and never falling below 100.8 during her
hospitalization.  WBC was 15.4 (no bands), ESR>120, CRP>18.
Creatinine was 1.3 on admission, down to 0.9 with fluids.  Flu
was negative and blood, urine, C. diff cultures have been
negative to date.

She was given levofloxacin and vancomycin for pulmonary and skin
coverage; antibiotics were broadened to levofloxacin,
ceftazidime and vancomycin IV and PO.  Her SBP was in the 90s in
the ED, she was volume resuscitated and SBP improved.  TTE and
OSH showed an EF of 50% without valvular lesions.  SpO2s have
been in the low to mid 90s on 3L nasal cannulae.  She has also
had bad joint pain during her hospitalization.  CT chest showed
diffuse airspace disease, bilateral reticular changes of
uncertain etiology, with the differential including infection,
edema and fibrosis.

She was seen by rheumatology at the OSH, who felt she likely ha
a flare of her RA.  Steroids were increased from prednisone 5mg
to 40mg.  Leflunomide toxicity was also raised as a possible
etiology, but level is pending and it is unclear when it will
come back.

On the night of [**11-14**], she experienced chest pain which resolved
with 3x nitroglycerin.  Troponin was elevated to 0.389, but with
no EKG changes.  EKGs showed old left bundle branch block, but
no STT wave changes.Interventricular conduction delay with a QRS
of 93 was noted on subsequent EKGs.  Her lasix was held given
recent [**Last Name (un) **], but other cardiac medications were maintained.
Anticoagulation with heparin or lovenox were thoguht to be
contraindicated  in the setting of anemia and therapeutic INR.

On arrival to the MICU, she appears ill, unable to complete full
sentences and frequently short of breath.  She was able to
corroborate the above history.  She also reports possible tick
exposure at the [**Last Name (un) 8548**] and in the garden of her home in the last
few weeks. No sick contacts or recent travel.  Reports pain in
neck and shoulders, intermittently also in her back. Reports
minimal cough, but acknowledges a runny nose.
