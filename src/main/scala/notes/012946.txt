Serum tox screen positive for EtOH (level 148) and tricyclics
(though this can be positive for Chlorpromazine ingestion).
Patient was seen by Toxicology who recommended IVF, serial EKGs
to monitor QRS/QTc for prolongation, possible intubation if
worsening mental status, seizure precautions, and frequent
monitoring of temperature.  While in ED, became hypotensive to
70s/30s. R IJ placed.  Was started on pressors with
norepinephrine, but MAPs remained in low 60s, and she was also
then started on phenylephrine.  Per ED, has continued to mentate
well.  Admitted now to ICU for close monitoring, and given
patient on pressors.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were:

CXR [**2107-8-19**]

Lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are
unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Previous central
line has been removed.  A severe dextroscoliosis again exists.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
40F w/ PMH bipolar disorder, anxiety, multiple prior suicide
attempts and polysubstance abuse who presented to ED
approximately one hour after taking sixty 100 mg tabs of
chlorpromazine course complicated by hypotension requiring
vasopressors and ICU stay

ACTIVE ISSUES

#Chlorpromazine overdose:
In the ED, toxicology consult was consulted.  She was initially
hypotensive and was fluid resuscitated as well as started on
pressors.  Before transfer to the MICU, she was weaned off
pressors. The patient was monitored for anticholinergic effects,
CNS depression, seizures, hypotension, and cardiotoxicity with
serial EKGs, telemetry, and serial lactates.  Neither her QRS
nor QTc became prolonged and she did not have any evidence of
arrythmias.  She was weaned off pressors and was hemodynamically
stable.
.
# Orthostatic hypotension
After resolution of the patients initial episode of hypotension,
her blood pressures again dropped into the SBP 90-100 range.
Her orthostatics were positive and she was given IV fluids.  A
CXR was checked for complications related to her ICU stay
(pneumothorax) and this was negative.  The patient had stable
BP's after this (her baseline is in the 90s per her), and she
had no symptoms of orthostasis and was eating and drinking well
and urinating normal amounts/volumes.
.
#Psychiatric illness, substance abuse:
Given degree of overdose and prior psychiatric history, there
was strong suspicion of suicide attempt. Pt was also actively
using cocaine and prostituing herself. By report, she is
effectively homeless although she refused to participate with
interview on admission to ICU.  Psychiatry was consulted for
evaluation and she was recommended for a dual diangosis
inpatient program once medically stable.  They felt that she
could be restarted on her home medications, but after talking
with pharmacy, we felt it was best to hold them for 24 hrs.
Social work was consulted for assistance with housing situation.
 The BEST team is involved with placing the patient.  A bed on
[**Hospital1 **] 4 became available and after medical clearance she was
discharged from inpatient medical [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 **] 4 for
ongoing inpatient psychiatric care.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
# Asthma-given 1 dose of albuterol and fluticasone for episode
of cough on the night of her admission.
