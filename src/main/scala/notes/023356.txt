CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ischemic right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female who

surgery with increasing edema and pain in the right lower

right foot. The patient states the right foot has been
mottled with pain for 1-1/2 to 2 weeks. She can ambulate 20
feet before pain increases in the right lower extremity. She
attributes the symptoms to her lower extremity being in a

The patient was admitted to the vascular service for further

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Meniere's disease,
hypercholesterolemia, mild asthma, neuropathy secondary to
surgery, scoliosis, cervical spine and lumbar disk disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cervical spine surgeries with fusion
and diskectomy, a lumbar surgery in [**2111-11-2**], lumbar
revision in [**2114-11-2**], scoliosis surgery in [**2114-11-2**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for alcohol. She does admit to
previous tobacco use, has not smoked since prior to her
scoliosis surgery in [**Month (only) 1096**] of this year.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 97.5, 78, 20, blood
pressure 116/60, O2 saturation 97% on room air. General:
Alert, oriented times 3, in no acute distress. Chest: Clear
to auscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Extremities:
Exam shows 3+ edema bilaterally with erythema on the lower
extremities, right greater than left. The right foot is
mottled with diminished motor in the right foot and increased
tenderness on the right compared to the left. There is
bullous lesions and ulcerations on the right foot of the
dorsal aspect and the right heel. Pulse exam shows palpable
femorals bilaterally, left DP is not palpable, left PT is
[**Name (NI) **]. Neither palpable or [**Name (NI) **] signals on the
right DP and PT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. She was IV hydrated for arteriogram. Routine labs
were obtained. IV heparinization was instituted and serial
coag studies were monitored. The patient was begun on
vancomycin, Cipro and Flagyl. She was continued on her home
medications.

The patient underwent diagnostic arteriogram on [**2114-12-18**], which demonstrated right external iliac thrombosis and
femoral thrombosis. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Her pulse exam remained unchanged and she had no hematoma.
The patient underwent a diagnostic MRV on [**2114-12-19**].
This demonstrated the IVC and bilateral common iliac,
internal iliacs and external iliacs to be patent. There was
complete thrombosis of the right external iliac artery which
is likely reconstituted via the pelvic and inferior
epigastric collateral vessels. The patient was noted to have
hyponatremia with a [**Year (4 digits) **] of 125 and a persistent
hypokalemia. Admitting potassium was 2.3. She was
supplemented.

A medical consult was placed. They felt that the hyponatremia
was related to the patient being dehydrated and she was begun
on an IV saline drip and potassium was related to over
diuresis with the Lasix. The Lasix and hydrochlorothiazide
were held and the patient continues to have potassium
supplemented.

The patient proceeded to surgery with a normal [**Year (4 digits) **] of 132
on [**2114-12-20**], with a potassium of 3.5. She underwent a
left-to-right femoral-to-femoral bypass with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex. She
tolerated the procedure well. Her heparin was reinstituted.
She remained stable and was transferred to the PACU for
continued monitoring and care.

The patient continued to do well and was transferred to the
VICU for postoperative monitoring. The patient had a
[**Doctor Last Name **] graft with improved flow to the right lower
extremity. On postoperative day 1 the patient was continued
on heparin and vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. She ran
a low-grade temperature of 100. Her pulse exam showed graft
was Doppler signal with [**Doctor Last Name **] DPs bilaterally, absent
PT on the right and [**Name (NI) **] PT on the left. The patient's
diet was advanced as tolerated. She remained on bed rest and
in the VICU for continued monitoring.

On postoperative day 2, she required adjustment in her
Lopressor dosing for her sinus tachycardia with improvement.
She was diuresed with Lasix. Her heparin was continued for a
goal of 50-70. She was D-lined and transferred to the regular
nursing floor. Medicine service continued to follow the
patient. Lasix and hydrochlorothiazide continued to be held.
On postoperative day 4 she was afebrile. Her pulse exam had a
[**Name (NI) **] PT. The right first toe was blue. The Lovenox was
instituted for conversion to Coumadin. The heparin was
discontinued 3 hours after the first Lovenox dose was
administered. She was given Coumadin 5 mg. First dose was on
[**2113-10-24**]. INRs have been monitored. Potassium
remained stable above 4 and [**Year (4 digits) **] was 132. The
hydrochlorothiazide should be reconstituted once the patient
is discharged to home for Meniere's disease. Her INR and
electrolytes should be monitored at least the first week she
is at home. The INR should be monitored daily until the goal
of 2.0-3.0 is met. The Lovenox can be discontinued 48 hours
after a steady state between 2.0 and 3.0. These results
should be called to her primary care physician's office. The
hydrochlorothiazide can be reinstituted once she is
discharged and electrolytes monitored and this followed by
her primary care physician.

The patient will be evaluated by physical therapy.
Disposition will be dependent on their recommendations and
the patient will be discharged to home versus rehab when
medically stable. For the remaining hospital course, if
additional comments are required, will have an addendum
dictated to the hospital course.
