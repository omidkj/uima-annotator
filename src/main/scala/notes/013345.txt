Service:  [**Location (un) **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 47-year-old male
with dyspnea on exertion.  The patient presented with a
three-week history of dyspnea on exertion.  He noted
shortness of breath with stairs and has also reported
increasing orthopnea.  The patient also reports a dry cough.
The patient questioned whether or not he had similar symptoms
in the past when he had an upper respiratory tract infection
when the patient self treated with antibiotics three days
prior to presentation without relief of his symptoms.

Patient denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
He has no known cardiac disease.  He traveled to the
[**Country 31115**] last year.  During that time, he had an upper
respiratory tract infection and reported being treated with
antibiotics.  Patient reported over the week prior to
admission, his orthopnea had progressed from sleeping flat to
sleeping in a chair at night.  He also noted increased weight
over the past month from approximately 230 pounds to 240
pounds.  He denied any diet changes.  He reports that
originally his shortness of breath was on climbing three
flights of stairs, but now he experiences shortness of breath
walking in a hallway.  Patient denied chest pain or
palpitations.

In the Emergency Room, the patient had a chest x-ray, which
was consistent with new congestive heart failure.  Patient
was given Lasix in the Emergency Room with some improvement
in his shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Sarcoidosis diagnosed by skin biopsy in [**2160-5-1**].  Had
normal pulmonary function tests in [**2163**].  No other known
involvement for sarcoidosis.
2. Hypertension.  Diet and exercise controlled.
3. Hypertriglyceridemia in [**2162**].
4. Status post lymph node resection in his neck in [**2160-11-1**], which was consistent with reactive lymph node tissue
with noncaseating granulomas.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  No tobacco, no
alcohol, and no IV drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Patient has a father, who passed away of a
MI in his 70's.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Patient was afebrile, blood
pressure 124/88, pulse 120, respirations 18, and saturating
96% on 2 liters.  In general, this is a well-appearing male
in no acute distress, talking in full sentences.  HEENT:
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, regular rhythm, normal S1, S2,
positive S3, JVD of about 10 cm.  Respiratory:  Crackles on
the left third of the way up right at the base.  Abdominal
exam:  Good bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Dorsalis
pedis were 2+.  Neurologic examination:  Patient was alert
and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact grossly.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White count 10.3, hematocrit
46.8, platelets 295.  Chem-7:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.9,
bicarb 20, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0.  D dimer was elevated at
1,721.

Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure with small
bilateral pleural effusions, upper lobe volume loss
consistent with adenopathy.

CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.  It did show
bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left and
ground-glass opacities throughout was also noted for
cardiomegaly.

EKG was sinus tachycardia at 120, left anterior fascicular
block, flat T waves laterally in V5 and V6 and poor R-wave
progression.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac, new congestive heart failure:  Patient with new
onset congestive heart failure of unclear etiology.  The
patient had an echocardiogram on [**3-13**], which revealed
an ejection fraction of [**10-16**]%, dilation of the atria and
ventricles as well as global LV hypokinesis and 2+ MR.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac catheterization to assess for
evidence of ischemia as an etiology for his congestive heart
failure.  Cardiac catheterization on [**3-16**] showed no
flow-limiting disease.  He had a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 36, LVEDP of 40, and cardiac index of 1.4.

Due to the very high filling pressures, the patient was
transferred to the CCU for diuresis with the assistance of
Swan-Ganz catheter.  Patient was diuresed in the CCU until
his wedge pressure came down appropriately, and then he was
transferred back to the floor.  The patient diuresed well
with Lasix as well.  Patient was started on an ACE inhibitor
as well as carvedilol and these were titrated up as
tolerated.  In addition to this, given his low ejection
fraction, the patient was also started on Coumadin prior to
discharge.  The exact etiology of his new congestive heart
failure maybe idiopathic, however, the possibility of
sarcoidosis is very real in this patient given his history of
biopsy consistent with sarcoid.

The patient had a myocardial biopsy at the time of his
cardiac catheterization, which did not reveal sarcoid.  The
patient had an ACE level of 48, which was normal.  Further
workup also included viral serologies, CMV IgM which was
equivocal, CMV IgG which was positive, EBV IgG positive, and
IgM was negative.  The patient was followed by the CHF
service in addition to this laboratory studies for possible
future transplant were also pursued.  Patient had an
abdominal ultrasound which was normal.

As an outpatient, the patient will follow up for gallium
thallium scan for further assessment of possible sarcoid as
the underlying etiology of his congestive heart failure.  He
will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital 1902**] Clinic.

2. Cardiac, CAD:  Patient with no known history of CAD.  Was
given an aspirin and a beta-blocker.  He had a cardiac
catheterization, which revealed no flow-limiting disease.

3. Rhythm:  Patient was admitted with sinus tachycardia
likely due to significant volume overload and congestive
heart failure.  He was monitored on telemetry and found to
have evidence of second-degree heart block.
Electrophysiology was consulted, and the patient had an AICD
device and DDI pacemaker placed.  He tolerated this procedure
well.

4. Hypertension:  Patient with slightly elevated blood
pressures on his admission.  The patient was started on an
ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker, and the patient's blood
pressure remained under good control.

5. Respiratory:  The patient with dyspnea of cardiac
etiology.  The ground-glass opacities on CT are likely due to
his congestive heart failure.  Pulmonary was consulted on
this patient.  They did not feel that the pulmonary findings
were consistent with sarcoid, however, the diagnosis of
sarcoid is still possible for cardiac etiology.  Although the
patient was low probability for pulmonary embolus, the
patient's D dimer was drawn in the Emergency Room and the
patient was ruled out for pulmonary embolus.

6. Heme:  Patient was started on Coumadin for his low
ejection fraction.  He was subtherapeutic at the time of
discharge.  His goal INR is 2-2.5.  He will follow up with
his primary care physician for further monitoring of his
Coumadin dosing.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. to be adjusted by primary care
physician.
2. Aspirin 81 q.d.
3. Lisinopril 10 q.d.
4. Carvedilol 3.125 b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5263**], his primary care physician in the week following
discharge.  The patient will discuss referral for a sleep
study to evaluate for possible obstructive-sleep apnea.  In
addition to this, he will have his INR checked for further
adjustment of his Coumadin dose.  Patient will follow up in
Electrophysiology Clinic on [**3-25**].  In addition to this,
the patient will follow up in [**Hospital 1902**] Clinic on [**4-6**].
