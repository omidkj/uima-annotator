Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
56 yo M with ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30%) presenting progressive
SOB, "feeling like (I'm) suffocating".  Two weeks ago, the
patient sustained a mechanical fall ([**2135-10-31**], head CT negative,
CXR neg), to his left chest wall and left jaw.  The pt has been
reporting increasing SOB since this fall from his baseline SOB,
and intermittent left sided chest pain (in location of bruise).
Per son's report the pt has SOB at baseline, not requiring home
oxygen, and was recently placed on 2L NC home O2 for dyspnea.
Per son's report the pt cannot lay flat, and has to sleep
propped up in a sitting or standing position.  He does not move
around much at baseline, and sits in a chair all day,
occasionally walking around.  Per son, the pt has not missed his
HD (MWF).  Patient underwent usual HD yesterday (MWF) which he
tolerated well by report.  He has continued to take his meds.
Son also reports increasing lethargy and disorientation, as pt
has difficulty sleeping b/c of sensation of SOB.  In [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
son's report, no palpitations, abd pain, N/V/D/C.  Poor po
intake.  Occasionally refuses treatment, and per son,
"difficulty to deal with."  Of note, he has an allergy to IV
contrast- causing a rash.
.
In the ED, the pt was satting 94% on 4L NC.  Noted to be in "mod
respiratory distress," using accessory muscles, placed on NRB,
satting 99%.  Went for CTA, which was negative for PE and
dissection, demonstrating , with the plan being to dialyze
immediately after CTA given contrast allergy and volume
overload.  However, apparently pt initially refused HD.  Pt was
then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.  In [**Name (NI) 153**], pt
requested HD.  Renal consult was called, and stated the Renal
attending felt the pt could be dialyzed in AM.  Also, pt was
with elevated troponins, but flat CKs, and CKMB X 2.  With
lateral ST depressions in V3-V6, and STE in leads V1-V3.

Past Medical History:
seizures since childhood, which began as generalized
tonic-clonic. He was treated with phenobarbitol and Mysoline.
Later, was changed to Depakote and Dilantin. Depakote was
discontinued roughly 4 years ago due to elevated ammonia levels.

Since, then his seizures have increased in frequency and
severity. As a result, muliple medications inculding Lamictal,
Trileptal, Tegretol and Keppra have been tried and he has most
recently been on combination of Keppra and Lamictal. His
seizures have been occuring about once every 1-2 months. Usual
episodes are
characterized by confusion and disorientation with rare,
generalized tonic clonic episodes. As per OMR notes, he has a
history of non-convulsive status which presented as confusion in

the past and responded to ativan.

Head CT: Comparison was made with the previous study of [**2135-10-31**].
Again, mild brain atrophy and mild changes of small vessel
disease are seen in the periventricular white matter. No
evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift seen.
Exuberant [**Date Range 1106**] calcifications are noted.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain compared to the
previous CT examination of [**2135-10-31**]. No evidence of acute
intracranial abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo m w/ ESRD on HD, who p/w CHF and ongoing CP, w/ non-focal
exam, ruled out for PE/dissection, w/ evidence of vol o/l,
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for dialysis.
.
1) pulm edema- initially assessed as vol o/l vs worsening chf.
o2 sat near baseline of prior week, but unclear why patient
inceasingly hypoxemic over the prior month (previously not on
oxygen).  ? possible decompensation in cardiac fxn given that
patient has not missed dialysis sessions and was not grossly
volume overloaded on exam.  ecg w/o significant changes.
patient was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name **] icu, ruled out for mi.  continued
on bb/acei.  Had planned to check tte but patient left AMA
immediately after he was transferred to the floor on HD2.|
.
2) contrast allergy- history not c/w anaphylaxis.  initial plan
in ED had been to premedicate w/ steroids and diphenydramine
followed by dialysis.  on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name **], renal refused to
dialyse sighting lack of clear indication and that patient had
add'l room as far as hypoxia to tolerate the osmotic load.
patient had no adverse reaction to the conrast dye
administration.
.
3) cp- likely msk given recent fall.  ruled out for
dissection/pe.  romi'd as above.-pain well controlled w/
percocet.
.
4) sz d/o- averaging 1 tonic/clonic per month
-stabilized on keppra/lamictal/oxazepam
.
5) htn- bp mildly elev on admission but did not receive antihtn
on day of admission.
-cont acei/bb
.
6) esrd- no absolute indication for dialysis.
-planned for dialysis on transfer to floor but patient left AMA.
