HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiothoracic surgical consultation was
obtained on the night of [**2143-9-20**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**] who thought the patient was an appropriate surgical
candidate.  The patient was initially scheduled to be taken
to the Operating Room on [**2143-9-21**], but there was
difficulty in obtaining catheterization films from the
outside hospital.  The patient was ultimately taken to the
Operating Room on [**2143-9-22**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**]
where the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4
with a left internal mammary artery to the LAD, saphenous
vein to PDA, saphenous vein to the diagonal and saphenous
vein to the PLV.  Postoperatively, the patient was
hemodynamically stable in normal sinus rhythm, was
transported from the Operating Room to the cardiac surgery
recovery unit.  The patient required low dose Neo-Synephrine
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3173**] drip overnight due to some transient hypotension
which resolved by the following day.

On postoperative day #1, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was weaned from mechanical ventilator and
extubated.  He was begun on diuretic, as well as beta
blockers.  On postoperative day #1, later in the day, the
patient was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit to the telemetry floor.  On postoperative day #2,
the patient was noted to have some decrease in urine output
overnight and was on a low dose dopamine drip, however with
an increase in his Lasix dosage urine output increased as
well and his dopamine was discontinued.  His chest tubes were
also discontinued, as was his central line on postoperative
day #2.  The patient was begun with physical therapy and
increased ambulation over the next two days.  On
postoperative day #3, the patient continued to progress with
physical therapy.  His beta blockade was increased.  Today,
[**2143-9-27**], postoperative day #5, the patient is
hemodynamically stable and ready to be discharged from the
hospital to a rehabilitation facility to increase his
physical therapy, increase his strength and endurance at a
short term rehabilitation facility.

140, potassium 3.8, BUN of 26, creatinine of 0.9, magnesium
