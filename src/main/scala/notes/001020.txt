service and to me status post Hartmann procedure.  He is a
78-year-old gentleman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] on high-dose
steroids who had a perforated sigmoid diverticulitis on
[**2128-10-12**] status post Hartmann procedure.  His postoperative
course was complicated by a pulmonary embolus, and he was placed
on Coumadin and subsequently developed some GI bleeding which
was
found to be superficial venous bleeding at the level of the
stoma

steroids for suppression of his myasthenia.  He presents today

[**2127-12-31**]  EKG:

Sinus rhythm. Possible inferior wall myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-10-16**]
heart rate is slower.
TRACING #1

[**2128-12-30**]:  chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-19**], there are lower
lung volumes with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and
bibasilar atelectasis. Small pleural effusions probably are
present bilaterally. In the appropriate clinical setting, the
possibility of a basilar pneumonia would have to be considered.

Upper lungs are clear and there is no vascular congestion.

[**2128-12-31**]:  ECHO:

 Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

[**2128-12-31**]:  EKG:

Sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing #1 there is no significant
diagnostic
change.

[**2128-12-31**]:  chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-30**], there has been
placement of Foley left subclavian catheter that extends to the
mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Continued bibasilar
opacifications most likely reflecting a combination of
atelectasis and effusion. No evidence of pulmonary congestion or
definite pneumonia.

[**2129-1-1**]:  chest x-ray:

CHEST: Since the prior chest x-ray, the endotracheal has been
removed. The
tip of the subclavian line lies in the mid-to-lower SVC. Lung
fields appear clear, no evidence of pneumonia or failure is
seen.



Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old gentleman admitted to the acute care service for
reversal of [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch. His operative course was stable
with a 20 cc blood loss. He required 1 liter crystalloid
intra-op.  He was extubated after the procedure and monitored in
the recovery room.

His post-operative course was complicated by hypotension and a
decreased urine output despite  additional intravenous fluids.
For this reason, he was transferred to the intensive care unit
for monitoring where he required 4 liters of fluid for blood
pressure support.  Neosynephrine was added to maintain his tone.
 Because he had an increasing lactate level, he was taken back
to the operating room on POD # 1 for an exploratory laparotomy.
He was found to have approximately 3500 mL of old and a new clot
throughout the abdomen as well as  active hemorrhage from the
left side of the distal mesocolon in the area of the previous
dissection.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain was placed in the area of the
hemorrhage.  During this procedure he required 3.5 liters of
crystalloid, 2 u PRBC, and 1 u FFP as well as neosynephrine.
Afte the procedure, he was transported to the intensive care
unit for further monotoring.  A bedside ECHO was done which
showed good LV and RV function.  On POD #1 from the exploratory
laparotomy, he was extubated  and his pressors were weaned off.
His hematocrit remained stable.  Because of the additional
fluids, he was started on lasix. His vital signs stabilzed and
he was transferred to the surgical floor on POD #2.

On POD #2, his [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was discontinued.  He continued
on his lasix because of his generalized body edema and later
changed to diamox. The diamox was discontinued on POD #7 after
he reported feeling lightheaded.  At this time, he was also
having occasional atrial and ventricular ectopy. His
electrolytes have been monitored and repleted.  He was started
on clears and resumed his home medications.  His intravenous
prednisone was weaned down and he transitioned to his oral home
dose.  He was noted to have a bloody ooze from his drain site
and from the lower aspect of his surgical wound.  This resolved
with the application of pressure. His hematocrit has remained
stable at 30.0.

His vital signs are stable and he is afebrile.  He is tolerating
a regular diet without complaints of nausea or vomitting.  He
has resumed his daily coumadin with an INR of 1.2.  He has been
encouraged to use the incentive spirometer and has maintained on
oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  His [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was
discontinued on POD #7 after he was found to have a decreased
