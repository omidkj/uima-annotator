INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild
regional LV  systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Moderate PA  systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal inferior  wall. The other segments
contract normally, and overall LVEF is preserved at  55%. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is  normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis  is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mildly
dilated right ventricle. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary
hypertension.

RENAL U.S. PORT

RENAL ULTRASOUND: There is normal corticomedullary
differentiation with normal cortical thickness bilaterally. The
right kidney measures 12.1 cm. The left kidney measures 11.5 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis, stones, or masses. The urinary
bladder is catheterized and decompressed limiting detailed
evaluation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.

Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility and waveforms are
demonstrated. Intraluminal thrombus is not identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.





Brief Hospital Course:
