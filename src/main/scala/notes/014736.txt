Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old female
with type II diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
who is being treated for pneumonia at rehabilitation with
levofloxacin with she developed fever, wheezing and decreased
blood pressure on [**3-28**].  In the Emergency Department
at [**Hospital1 1474**], temperatures were noted to be 101?????? with a heart
rate of 125, blood pressure of 102/51, respiratory rate of 28
and patient was 99% on nonrebreather and 94% on 3 liters of
O2.  Her blood pressure decreased to 60/palp requiring
intravenous fluid.  There is no infiltrate noted on chest
x-ray, but treated with ceftriaxone as well as Zosyn.
Arterial blood gases in the Emergency Room at that time was
noted to be a pH of 7.33, CO2 of 55, O2 of 107 on 3 liters of
O2.

On the medical records from the outside hospital, the patient
was noted to have a recent experience of chest pain at rest
as well as with exertion.  It is unclear from the medical
records whether the chest pain was new versus chronic and
whether there was a progressive component to this.  The
patient was treated as a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation with nebulizers and steroids and the
patient had cardiac enzymes cycled.  The patient was not
given a beta blocker or aspirin.  The patient was emergently
intubated on [**3-29**] in the a.m. for respiratory
distress.  Arterial blood gases at that time was noted to
have a pH of 7.19, PCO2 of 68 and an O2 of 76.

CKs peaked at the outside hospital at 188 with an MB of 21
and an index of 11.7 on the morning of [**3-29**].  The
patient was also noted to have the evolution of T-wave
inversions in the lateral and inferior leads.  She was
diuresed with Lasix 60 mg intravenous total.  A beta blocker
still was not added on at that time.  The patient also did
not receive aspirin until [**3-29**] in the p.m. secondary
to a questionable aspirin allergy.  Heparin drip was started
on [**3-29**] in the evening and the patient was also
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  The patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**]
for further work up including cardiac catheterization.  On
arrival to [**Hospital6 256**], the patient
was arousable and denied any chest pain or any other pain.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 80-year-old female with type II
diabetes, hypertension, tobacco history, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on
[**3-28**] with pneumonia and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.  He appeared to have an
ischemic event.  On the night of [**3-28**] there was
evolution of infarct in the inferior and lateral leads by the
a.m. of [**3-29**].  The patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital6 256**] for cardiac
catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIAC:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization lab on [**2164-3-30**].  Findings included:
One vessel coronary artery disease, left main coronary artery
had mild disease, the LAD had an ulcerated 70% proximal
stenosis and a 50% mid lesion, the left circumflex and RCA
had mild diffuse disease, mild elevation of the wedge
pressure noted at 15 mmHg, mild PA hypertension with a
pressure of 37/15 and status post successful direct stenting
to the LAD.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without
any complications.  Post catheter checks revealed no bruit or
hematoma.

Post catheter, the patient was started on a regimen which
included aspirin, Plavix, Captopril, Lopressor and her
cholesterol labs were checked.  Doses of medication were
incrementally increased based on blood pressure and at the
time of discharge, the patient was maintained on a dose of
Zestril 40 mg po q day and atenolol 37.5 mg po q day.  In
light of the patient's history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and likely concomitant chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient's beta blocker
dose was slowly increased, however the patient tolerated all
dose adjustments witho
