Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7929**] was originally sent to the CCU, where he was
monitored on tele overnight in anticipation of having a cath/EP
study once he was more stable.  He had no further episodes of
VFib.  On the floor, he did have a few runs of NSVT (5-7 beats)
that were asymptomatic.  He was extubated on the morning of
[**8-1**], and originally had some cognitive deficits involving his
short term memory.  At first, he wasn't responding to questions
at all, but this had resolved by the time he came to the floor.
Originally he would forget things seconds after being told, but
this had completely resolved by the day of discharge.  He had
been previously placed on coumadin as an outpt for a depressed
EF, and this was held while a heparin drip was begun.  He was
maintained on a heparin drip until his cath.  At his cath, they
found:
1. Coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
circulation with
severe two vessel coronary artery disease.  LMCA had no
significant
disease.  LAD had 80% stenosis before and involving the origin
of D2 and
after S1 (with collaterals to RCA).  LAD was totally occluded
after the
large D2.  D2 supplies apex and collaterals to RCA.  Lcx had a
large OM
branch and was free of significant disease. RCA was totally
occluded at
promixial to mid segment.
2. Limited resting hemodyanics revealed moderately elevated left
and
righ sided filling pressures.  mRA was 14 mmHg, and RVEDP was 16
mmHg.
RVSP was mildly elevated at 43 mmHg.  mPCW was elevated at 23
mmHg.
Fick calculated cardiac output and index were perserved at 6.1
L/min and
2.8 L/min/m2, respectively.
3.Successful Rotational Atherectomy and stenting of the mid LAD
lesion with a 2.75x23mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] with a 3.0x15mm
NC Ranger
baloon inflated at 20 atms.
An Echo done on [**8-1**] showed:
Severely dilated left ventricle with extensive systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the report of 12/93 (tape unavailable for review),
the left
ventricular cavity is now more dilated, overall systolic
function is more
depressed, aortic regurgitation has increased.
He also had an EP study performed while he was here, and they
recommended ICD placement which was done on [**8-3**].  This was
complicated by a minor hematoma in the pocket of the pacer, that
did not grow in size and remained nontender.  He was given
vancomycin x3 doses and was sent home on Keflex for a total of 5
days.  The evening of the pacer placement, the pt was noted to
be tachycardic to the 120s.  An EKG showed sinus tach.  It was
felt this was likely [**2-6**] beta-blocker withdrawal, as it had been
approx 4-5 days since he had last had his BB (originally had
lower bp in CCU, systolic 100s so the BB had been held).  This
was restarted with good pulse control, although on ambulation he
still got up into the 100s and so his Toprol dose was increased
on d/c.  In terms of his other medications, his digoxin and
quinidine were discontinued.  It was felt he did not need to be
on anticoagulation with coumadin, given the questionable hx of
LV clot that was not seen on repeat echo, and given that he
would be at least on ASA and plavix.  His Lasix and Lisinopril
were not increased all the way back to his previous home doses,
as it was felt he would have a better EF given his [**Hospital1 **]-v pacing
and may not need as high a dose.  He had a UTI which was treated
with a 7 day course of Bactrim.  He did have a low-grade temp
(100.6) on [**8-3**] and [**8-4**], but had 2 CXR's negative for
infiltrate and no localizing signs of infection other than his
UTI.  His pacer site specifically did not look infected.  He was
discharged home with instructions to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
[**4-11**] weeks and his PCP/Cardiologist Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7931**] within [**1-6**]
weeks.
