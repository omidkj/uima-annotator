Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line by femoral access


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with ESRD, chronic AF on coumadin, CAD, HF
admitted with dyspnea and confusion. She was discharged on [**1-5**]
after being admitted for similar issues, which responeded to
volume removal in HD. She would be due for HD today. On [**1-6**],
VNA found her to be hypoxemic with a O2 sat only 76-80 and she
was started on 4L home O2. She had been on O2 in the hospital
but d/c'd off of it. She had been confortable since getting put
on oxygen. She continues to sleep much of the day and not eat
more. This morning, she awoke very confused. She was refusing to
go to HD and wanted to go to the [**Hospital1 **] instead. Her daughter said
she had a similar episode of confusion this past [**Holiday **]
that was attributed to pain meds.
In the ED, she had triage BP 70s and sats 80s, but initial vital
signs were 98.8 102 97/51 26 100/NRB without intervention for
her blood pressure. She was alert and oriented x 2.5. She was
found to have an increased right-sided pleural effusion. She had
LLQ pain and CT abd shoed pneumpbilia. This was atributed to her
stent and thought to be an unlikely source of sepsis. She was
put on BiPAP to tolerate the CT scan. She was given Vanc/Zosyn
for a possible R sided pneumonia and 250 cc NS for the
borderline hypotension. A left femoral line was placed given
poor access. She gets HD via a fistula. Prior to transfer, VS:
98.8 87 93/67 15 100% on NRB. She confirmed being DNR/DNI.
Currently, she does not remember why she came to the hospital.
Her breathing feels better and she complains only of a dry
mouth. She believes that she has been in the hospital for 3
weeks and wants to go home. She complains of an intermittently
sore "butt". She asks for a sip of water and explains that her
doctor tells her that she must chin-tuck to avoid aspiration.

ADMISSION IMAGING

CXR The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and stable
since the prior study. There has been interval improvement of
the
moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions and atalectasis. The
pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable and there is no evidence of edema.
There is no
pneumothorax.

CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis.
2. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
3. Small amount of pelvic free fluid.
4. T12 compression deformity, which is new from [**2120-11-21**],
but seen on
the prior chest radiographs from [**2122-11-22**].
5. Pneumobilia within the left lobe of the liver, likely related
to recent
sphincterotomy, but clinical correlation is advised.
6. Right renal and hepatic cysts.
7. Trace perihepatic ascites.
8. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage,
mass effect, or shift of midline structures is demonstrated.
Diffuse global atrophy is noted, which is age appropriate.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are stable,
compatible with chronic small vessel ischemicchanges.
Differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter is preserved. Visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Calcification of the cavernous portions of both internal carotid
arteries is again noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with ESRD on HD, AFib on coumadin, CAD, CHF,
pulmonary HTN, ?aspiation pneumonias, hypothyroidism presenting
with acute agitation and possible hypoxemia. She was recently
admitted for the same issue and returned within 48 hours of
discharge.

Hypoxemia
 This patient's peripheral oxymetry readings are unreliable. The
patient saturates well on room air if the oxymetry is taken on
the forehead. The patient's pa02 on room air (on admission) was
in the 80's with an otherwise normal abg. When placed on a
non-rebreather, her PaO2 was 347 and she became alkalotic.

Hypotension
 The patient is hypotensive at baseline with home readings that
vary between 70 and 100 in the systolic value. With a pressure
of 80/40, she can interact well and even explain the physiology
of her 'chin-tuck' swallow technique. She was discharged on an
increased dose of midodrine

Pleural effusions
 The patient has pleural effusions likely related to diastolic
heart failure, hypothyroidism, afib with rvr and malnutrition.
They were slightly worse on this admission but made no clinical
impact

Afib with RVR
 The patient often oscillates in and out of RVR. Her pressures
did not tolerate an increase in metroprolol. Her coumadin doses
were changed on discharge

ESRD on HD
 The patient is dependent on HD for renal replacement.

Agitation
 The patient will be discharged with an Rx for prn Zydis

Poor apetitie
  Patient was discharged on megace
