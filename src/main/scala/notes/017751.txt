reports taken Ibuprofen up to 1800/day for pain. No weight gain,
no leg swelling.
He was given kayexalate, insulin dextrose, calcium gluconate and

This patient was due to be transfered for a physical therapy
institution. However, On the evening prior to transfer, the
patient began to notice some mild abdominal distention. Physical
examination revealed a mildly tympanitic abdomen and no change
in his vital signs. The patient continued to tolerate oral
feedings without difficulty. On the morning of the surgical
procedure, which was [**2179-9-21**], the patient demonstrated
further abdominal
distention. Work-up included a KUB which revealed an 11 cm
gas-filled structure in the midabdomen, and CT scan revealed
this to be free of intraperitoneal air. The patient was
therefore scheduled for urgent laparotomy. Findings included:
Gangrene of the gallbladder with obscuration of structures in
the right upper quadrant, question of perforation of a duodenal
ulcer,  5 L intraperitoneal abscess, and a 2.5 cm perforation of
the proximal transverse colon.
