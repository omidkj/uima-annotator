Service:  TRA


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Status post fall.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Bilateral frontal lobe contusions.
3. Right cerebellar hemispheric bleed.
4. Subdural bleed.
5. Right occipital bone fracture, nondisplaced.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
female, who suffered a mechanical fall from a standing
position on [**2140-3-22**].  She was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital for further trauma management.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable.  She was never hypoxic.  Her GCS was
7 on arrival.  She underwent further imaging evaluation by
the Trauma Team after she was seen and evaluated in the
Trauma Bay.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Gout.
2. Osteoarthritis.
3. Hypertension.
4. Cataracts.
5. Question of CHF.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not available.


OUTPATIENT MEDS:
1. Vioxx.
2. Lasix 40 4x a day.
3. Prevacid 30 once a day.
4. Atenolol 25 twice a day.
5. Allopurinol 100 once a day.
6. Iron.
7. Tylenol.
8. Eyedrops.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam the patient had a GCS of 7.
The patient was intubated for airway control given her GCS of
7.  Her pupils were equal and reactive bilaterally.  Heart
was regular.  Chest was clear.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Her lower extremities revealed no deformity.
Her right upper extremity had a small laceration that was not
bleeding.

RADIOLOGY FILMS:
1. Chest x-ray was negative.
2. A-P pelvis was negative.
3. CT head revealed contusion to the frontal lobes with a
   hematoma on the right cerebellar hemisphere, a subdural
   hematoma, and subarachnoid blood, a nondisplaced single
   fracture of the right occipital bone as well as a probable
   chronic subdural fluid collection in the right
   frontoparietal area with some brain atrophy.
4. Her CT of the abdomen and pelvis was negative.
5. TLS negative.
6. Right humerus negative.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated in the
Trauma Bay by the Trauma Team, and was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for q1h neurological checks and
hemodynamic monitoring.  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course by
systems is as follows:

1. Neurologic:  The patient had the above mentioned findings
   on head CT and was seen and evaluated by the Neurosurgery
   team.  She had several repeat head CT scans, which were
   stable, and her neurologic exam slowly improved over the
   hospital course to the point where she was following
   commands and was able to be extubated.

The patient's C spine was attempted to be cleared when she
was extubated, however, she did have some probable
ligamentous instability at C3-C4, therefore she was kept in a
C collar.

1. Cardiovascular:  The patient did have some episodes of
   tachycardia during her hospital stay.  It was thought to
   be sinus tachycardia with PAC's given her EKG findings.
   Her Lopressor dose was increased and her heart rate
   reduced into the low 100s.

1. Respiratory:  The patient was extubated initially midway
   throughout her hospital course, and given the fact that
   she was having difficulty breathing after extubation, and
   was tachypneic and tachycardic, she was reintubated.  Upon
   reintubation, she had copious increase in thick secretions
   and was started on Levaquin empirically for a pneumonia.
   Her secretions did improve to the point that she was able
   to be extubated with aggressive pulmonary toilet.  She did
   have a total collapse of her left lung and underwent an x-
   ray on [**2140-4-2**].  She underwent a bronchoscopy and awake
   bronchoscopy, and the patient's left lung, did improve,
   but she did have some persistent left lower lobe collapse.
   Her sputum did grow out on [**2140-4-1**] MRSA and the patient
   was started on vancomycin for this.  Her respiratory
   status improved greatly with pulmonary toilet.

1. GI:  The patient was started on tube feeds initially
   during her stay.  These were continued and most recently
   she was started on a diet as her speech and swallow
   evaluation revealed that she was able to tolerate nectar-
   thickened liquids and a soft puree diet.  As her nutrition
   is not optimized yet, she is continuing on her tube feeds
   until she is at goal nutrition.

1. GU:  The patient does have a Foley catheter.  She has had
   no issues with urine output.  Has received Lasix
   intermittently for diuresis.  Of note, she was on Lasix at
   home, however, this was not restarted during her hospital
   stay.  She appeared to be fairly euvolemic.  She may
   require Lasix to be restarted during her rehab stay.

1. Heme:  The patient did not have any significant drops in
   her hematocrit.  She was started on subcutaneous Heparin
   5000 b.i.d. when cleared by Neurosurgery, and should
   continue on this.

1. ID:  The patient is now on vancomycin day nine.  She is
   going to get five more days of vancomycin for a 14 day
   course for her MRSA pneumonia.  She had no other positive
   blood cultures, and does have a persistent left lower lobe
   collapse with secretions.

1. Endocrine:  The patient is on a sliding scale with her
   tube feeds and receiving insulin per the sliding scale
   with q.i.d. fingersticks.

1. Prophylaxis:  The patient is on Prevacid with Venodyne
   boots and subcutaneous Heparin.


DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Tylenol 325 p.o. q.4-6h. prn.
2. Heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.
3. Dulcolax prn.
4. Regular insulin-sliding scale.
5. Acetylcysteine 20 percent q.2h. prn for thick secretions.
6. Albuterol nebulizers q.4h.
7. Ipratropium bromide two puffs q.i.d.
8. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9. Nystatin swish and spit p.o. q.i.d. prn.
10.      Vancomycin 1000 mg q.24h. for five more days.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient's discharge instructions are
to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26803**] in one month at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56306**] with a head CT and flex-x films of her C spine prior to
followup.  She is to followup in the Trauma Clinic in [**12-29**]
weeks.  She continued receiving Impact with fiber at 60 cc an
hour, to get chest PT q.6h. with nasogastric suction q.6h.
She needs a Xeroform dressing and dry dressing to her right
upper arm q.d.  She does need aggressive physical therapy and
pulmonary toilet.
