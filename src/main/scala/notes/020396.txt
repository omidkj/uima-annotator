Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He is a 41-year-old, with
history of HIV.  CD-4 was 238 in [**12-20**].  Hepatitis B virus,
end stage liver disease.  He was awaiting hepatorenal
transplant.  Prior to admission, he had a three day history
of fever.  He was recently discharged to home.  He did well
for 5 days prior to the current admission.  The patient's
partner noticed that the patient was complaining of feeling
hot and took his temperature and found to have a temperature
of 101.0 orally and for that reason subsequently asked for
admission. The patient was brought in. He denied abdominal
pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea or vomiting. He
denied URI symptoms.  He did report that he was recently
admitted for feeding tube placement and post pyloric and had
admission to the ICU after the patient then developed fevers
and hypotension following a therapeutic paracentesis,
requiring volume resuscitation.  At that point in time, no
source was discovered and the patient remained afebrile, off
of antibiotics but then returned for the current admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for HIV, hepatitis B, end
stage liver disease, chronic renal insufficiency, anemia,
neuropathy.  The patient had a tonsillectomy in the past.  He
has had multiple paracentesis in the past.  He has pulmonary
hypertension and heart murmur.  He works in real-estate,
smokes 2 to 3 cigarettes per day, 25 pack year history.  No
ETOH.  No drugs.  He is from [**Country 4194**] and lives with his
partner.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a mom with diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  According to medical
intern, temperature was 97.7, blood pressure 118/70, pulse
74, rate 20, 97 percent on room air. Pupils equal, round,
reactive to light, anicteric. Oropharynx was clear. No
cervical lymphadenopathy.  Regular S1-S2.  2 out of 6
systolic ejection murmur, loudest at the apex. Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Positive distention, positive
fluid wave. Positive shifting dullness on the abdominal
examination.  Trace lower extremity edema. White count was
4.7, hematocrit was 24. Platelets were 58 on admission.
Sodium 137 over 5.3, 104 over 23, 70 over 3.9, blood sugar of
139.  Calcium, mag and phos were 7.6, 3.9 and 5.8
respectively.  Peritoneal fluid ascites was 50. Active issues
were a fever of unclear etiology, acute on chronic renal
failure, hyperkalemia, end-stage liver disease, anemia, HIV
on heart, FEN. Those were his active issues upon admission.

The patient was admitted to the medical service, after a
paracentesis.  Renal service was consulted for acute on
chronic renal failure.  Peritoneal fluid was sent multiple
times.  Echocardiogram was performed.  No evidence of
endocarditis was noted. The patient continued to have fevers
and was treated for peritonitis.  The patient remained on the
medical service and on the Friday before discharge, he was
transferred to the surgical service because there were
nursing issues on the floor as to being able to have the
level of care the patient was requiring.  Therefore, the
patient was transferred to surgical ICU and transferred
services from the medical service to the surgical ICU team
and followed by the transplant team as per the rule that
pretransplant patient's were transferred from medical service
over to surgical service.  At that point in time was the
first time that I had begun to take care of this patient and
on initial examination he was somebody who obviously had
suffered from longstanding liver disease and had extensive
ascites, requiring tap every 48 hours in order for patient's
comfort. His bilirubin hovered around the rate of 63 and he
was quite icteric.  The patient was then admitted to the
surgical ICU in anticipation of potential liver, kidney
donation and subsequent transplantation.  By systems, the
patient was neurologically intact.  Conversationally confused
at times but was definitely cohesive in his thoughts and
understood and was oriented to time, place and person.
Pulmonary:  The patient had coarse breath sounds at the bases
and was actually doing quite well from a pulmonary
perspective.  From a cardiovascular perspective, the murmur
had been noted and echocardiogram had previously been worked
up in order to evaluate this patient. All of that was found
to be within normal limits and the patient's pulmonary
hypertension was once again reestablished.  However, the
patient did not suffer any abnormal rhythms during his stay
in the ICU nor did he manifest any cardiac disease.  From a
GI perspective, the patient was on tube feeds at goal,
meeting goal protein needs.  However, he had the ability to
reaccumulate fluid and was in a cycle where he needed to be
tapped at least q. 48 to 72 hours requiring potentially 5
liters of fluid to be taken off as ascites.  His LFTs were
consistent with end-stage liver disease with his bilirubin
hovering in the mid 60 range.  From a GU perspective, the
patient made minimal urine and had a Foley catheter that was
placed and was able to irrigate the bladder out with
Amphotericin for fungal infection of the bladder.  This was
carried out for several days and this was then stopped.  The
patient remained in the surgical service for approximately 3
days while waiting potential liver and renal transplant. He
was evaluated by all of the transplant service on a continual
basis and extensive discussions were taken with family and
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] and his team.  The transplant attendings
rounded on the patient and decided that he was a poor
candidate for surgery.  At this point in time, the patient
was delisted and the family members decided that the patient
would be discharged to home and he was discharged to
home/hospice care.  He was deemed unfortunately, not a
suitable candidate for transplant. Therefore, the patient was
discharged in tenuous condition with end-stage liver disease,
end-stage renal disease, in need of a transplant. However, he
was unfortunately to ill to be transplanted.  Therefore, he
was discharged to hospice.  The patient was discharged on
[**2142-4-27**] to home in tenuous condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. End-stage liver disease, subsequent to hepatitis B.
2. Advanced HIV.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Acute renal failure.
5. Anemia.
6. Neuropathy.
7. Pulmonary hypertension.
8. Hepatorenal syndrome.
9. Cachexia.
10.      Hyperkalemia.
11.      Coagulopathy.
12.      Failure to thrive.
13.      Ascites.
14.      History of bleeding esophageal varices.
15.      History of bleeding rectal varices.

The patient was discharged to home. Subsequently, the patient
by report passed away several days after discharge to home.
