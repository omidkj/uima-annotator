HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, she was seen by the Pulmonary
Service due to her CHF.  She has been recommended regular
bronchodilators also preoperative ABGs, PFTs, and aggressive
analgesia postoperatively for pain.

The patient was taken to the OR on [**2159-6-11**] and underwent an
L4-S1 lumbar fusion with pedicle screw fixation.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  Postoperatively, she was
monitored in the Recovery Room overnight.  Her vital signs
were stable.  She was afebrile.  She had a chest x-ray which
showed no infiltrates.  She was weaned to extubate.

On postoperative day number one, her drains were discontinued
and she was transferred to the regular floor.  She was out of
bed in a brace.  She was doing well.

On [**2159-6-13**], the patient had an episode of shortness of
breath with decreased sats into the 70s.  A chest x-ray
showed aspiration and a question of a small episode of CHF.
The patient was given IV Lasix and the patient had been
getting Lasix postoperatively to prevent respiratory failure.
The patient was transferred to the ICU where she did not
require any intubation.  Her oxygenation was maximized with a
face mask and she diuresed 400-600 cc of fluid after getting
Lasix.

She was also seen by the Renal Service due to her renal
insufficiency and her inability to diurese well given the IV
Lasix.  Renal just recommended keeping her blood pressure
above 120 and diuresing her to get her fluid balance to be -1
to 1.5 liters per day.  This was achieved and the patient was
stabilized from a respiratory standpoint.  She was then
transferred back to the floor on [**2159-6-15**] where she has
remained neurologically and respiratory wise stable.  Her
vital signs are stable.  She was afebrile.
