History of Present Illness:
68y/o F with PMH of CAD s/p 4 vessel CABG and recent stent to
graft, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20-30, s/p ICDm just
discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for CHF exacerbation (in CCU on
dopa and lasix gtt) now presenting with chest pain. Since
discharge, patient has been seen by VNA at home and today was
noted to be hypotensive to SBP of 70s with lightheadedness and
dizziness. Shortly thereafter she experienced fleeting chest
pain, lasting approximately one minute and then resolved. She
denies worsening of baseline SOB, palpitations, F/C, N/V/D,
dysuria/hematuria. Patient was mostly concerned with left foot
pain that started the night prior to admission. Patient denies
any injury to her foot and likewise denies swelling or redness.
She reports that the foot was extremely painful to touch and
even bedsheets hurt her. She denies and history of foot or joint
problems, specifically gout. Given the continued pain, she
presented to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, vitals were notable for a SBP in the 70s with arm
cuff and patient was given a 250 cc bolus. Her blood pressure
was rechecked in the thigh and found to be 122/57. Patient was
chest pain free and reportedly even denied ever having chest
pain. EKG was unchanged from prior and CXR showed stable
cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Given the foot pain, foot
films were obtained and were unremarkable. Patient was also
noted to have acute on chronic renal failure with creatinine of
2.1, up from 1.6 and down trending, but positive Troponin of .55
(1.09 on [**10-22**]). Patient was then admitted for further management
of chronic cardiac disease.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was sleeping comfortably,
denying chest pain or foot pain.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of ankle edema,
syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Ankle/Foot Films (R/L) - no acute fractures, effusions.

L foot films:
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture.
2. Hallux valgus/metatarsus varus deformity with bunion
formation.

R foot films:
FINDINGS: Three views show no evidence of acute bone or joint
space
abnormality. There is a small inferior and moderate posterior
calcaneal
spurring.

BL ankle films:
FINDINGS: No evidence of acute bone or joint space abnormality.
Small
calcifications and soft tissues could be within phlebolith.

Abdominal Ultrasound:
FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture. No focal lesion is
identified. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The
gallbladder wall is again mildly thickened. Son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) **]
sign is absent. In comparisons with ultrasound of [**2203-10-22**], there
is no significant interval change. The main portal vein is
patent with appropriate direction of flow. The spleen is
unremarkable and normal in size. A tiny amount of perihepatic
free fluid is visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68 yo M w/ CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and OA and
multiple admissions for CHF exacerbation with multiple diuretic
changes/increases including HCTZ who presents with bilateral
ankle pain and developed acute on chronic CHF.
.
# Cardio/pulmonary arrest:  Pt had end-stage CHF. Pt's wishes
and prognosis were discussed at a family meeting with Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**],
palliative care, and [**Doctor First Name 1258**]. Decided to be DNR/DNI, goal to be
comfortable at home. Pt was transitioned to CMO, and pt's ICD
was turned off on [**11-9**]. Pt became hypotensive overnight down to
80s/60s and a fluid bolus was given overnight. In the AM it was
clarified that vitals were to be discontinued and to only to be
given bolus if symptomatic. Plan was to transfer to home hospice
tomorrow, but today [**11-10**] at about 12:00 pt became more SOB and
then apneic and died of cardio-pulmonary arrest.

# Acute on Chronic Systolic HF: (EF 20%) In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was
hypotensive in 70s, and given a 250ml bolus and responded to
122/57. Pt was initially euvolemic and w/o orthopnea, PND, or
DOE on the floor, but later to become volume overloaded. Pt was
treansferred to the CCU for milrinone since unable to tolerate
fluid challenge for renal failu
