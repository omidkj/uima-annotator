History of Present Illness:
77 yo male who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency
Department c/o dysuria, nocturia, h/o urinary retention,
inability to urinate for >8 hours, bladder discomfort. Pt stated
that he had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21655**] placed on [**2201-2-27**] for hematuria of unknown
etiology. The next communication with the urologist was [**2201-3-12**],
whereby the patient called to state his urine had been clear for
5 days. Pt instructed to cut foley and remove it. In the ED at
NW, foley placement was attempted but failed secondary to
resistence. Foley insertion tried again with success, draining
frankly bloody urine. Pt discharged to home later that evening.
Pt was driving home from the hospital, and due to unknown
causes, crashed his car into a pole. He was found next to his
car and taken directly to [**Hospital1 18**].

CXR: CHF
Pelvis: neg
CT head: right occipital small hyperdenisity? calcifications
CT spine: neg
CT chest: small pericardial effusion, no PTX, +bibasilar
atalectasis
CT abd/pelvis: 5.3 cm aortic aneurysm; 2.6 cm right iliac
aneurysm
CT cystogram: neg

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was intubated on the scene and brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency
department. A full body scan and radiographs were performed,
significant for CHF, aortic and right iliac aneurysms, and a
small pericardial effusion.

CV: Presentation raised question CHF c/s tamponade, and
cardiogenic shock. No e/o of aortic injury on CT, however. PA
catheter placed for closer directed therapy. Pt placed on
pressors for added blood pressure support. Cardiology called to
see patient to further evaluate. Noted pt had significant aortic
stenosis, requiring a cath in the near future once pt is more
stable. Pt did not have stress secondary to contraindication to
persantine with AS. Spoke with PCP who will set up cath as OP
when pt stable Pt may also decide to have cath at the [**Hospital1 18**].

Respiratory: Evidence of CHF, likely due to AS. Initial RLL
infiltrate suspicious for PNA. Pt started on empiric antibiotic
therapy with Vanc/Levoflox, however, pt continued to spike
fevers. Zosyn started and levo/vanc discontined. Fevers resolved
without clear source of infection. On HD #8 pt was extubated
successfully without complications.

Endo: ICU: Hydrocortisone started x 5 days after failing [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stim test. Pt able to maintain adequate blood pressures after
adequate resusitation. Steroids and pressors discontinued
successfully in SICU.

Heme: ICU: Pancytopenic on presentation. Transfused platelets,

Neuro: ICU: Repeat Head CT negative for IC process. No focal
neurological deficits.

GI: ICU: Pt initially placed on tube feeds, however, once
extubated, pt immediately tolerated po's without incident.

GU: Pt has had history of hesitancy, hematuria prior to hospital
stay. Urine initially clear. Urine cytology showed abnormal
cells for which malignancy could not be ruled out. Urology
re-consulted to evaluate for cystoscopy, which they recommended
as an outpatient. Spoke with PCP who will set up cystoscope as
OP at [**Location **] VA.
Pt sent on whole bladder irrigation until urine clears to rehab.
