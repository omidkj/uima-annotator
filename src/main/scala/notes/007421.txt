Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2172-6-26**] redo sternotomy/Bentall with #21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
valve


History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 yo man with a history of bicuspid aortic valve, s/p
mechanical AVR and repair of ascending aortic aneurysm in [**2166**],
HTN, past episodes of chest pain, s/p gastric bypass surgery,
GERD, s/p multiple knee, shoulder, and spine surgeries, prior
narcotic and EtOH abuse, and a history of IV heroin abuse, who
presented to NWH on [**6-20**] after a syncopal episode at home, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further management of mechanical
AVR endocarditis.

Regarding his syncopal event, he reports getting out of the
shower and "things turned black" and he woke up in the
ambulance. Per the NWH discharge summary, he felt dizzy before
blacking out (and had been feeling dizzy on standing for a week
prior). His girlfriend found him over the toilet and was awake
and talking - she apparently estimated that he had been down for
5 minutes.

The patient had been feeling ill for ~2 wks, with sweats, chills
(didn't take his temp), nausea, loss of appetite, productive
cough, and non-bloody diarrhea. Over that time he also has had
episodes of shortness of breath and a sensation that his chest
is "collapsing" associated with chills.  He also has had
palpitations.  He also noted a pustule on his skin which had
drained several days prior to presenting.  He also notes an MVA
2 months ago where he broke a tooth.

He denies any IV heroin use in the last 7 months but notes
snorting heroin within the last week to "make himself feel
better". Per the NWH ED report, they saw fresh bilateral track
marks on [**6-20**].
He is on Coumadin for his prosthetic valve but notes having not
taken this for the week prior to presenting - he says he ran out
of his prescription and does not have a doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] it. He
says he last checked his INR 3-4 weeks ago.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:
--CRP 18.2, HIV and Hep B/C serologies negative, Lyme neg, BCx
on [**6-20**] POSITIVE 3/4 bottles for coag neg staph, NGTD x 1 on
[**6-21**], UCx neg on [**6-21**]

He was admitted to the ICU.
--TTE showed LVEF 65%, mild LVH (concentric), mild LAH, mildly
dilated RA, aortic valve well-seated with NL function, no
perivalve leak, trace AR, mild MR, mild TR, est RV sys pressure
36.4mmHg with RA pressure 10mmHg
ID was consulted and the patient was treated with IV vancomycin
1500 mg q12h, IV zosyn 2.25 g q6h, and a one-time dose of
gentamicin (3 mg/kg) on [**6-21**]. Repeat EKG showed 1st degree AV
conduction delay with PR 200-210.
--TEE showed LVEF 50-55%, abn function in [**Month/Year (2) **] valve with
diffuse echodensity surrounding it and mobile masses c/w
vegetations and possible thrombus. aortic root abscess noted.
ant leaflet of MV thickened
Regarding thromboprophylaxis for his mechanical St. [**Month/Year (2) 923**] valve,
he initially was started on a heparin drip but this was stopped.
He was bridged with lovenox 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] and started on warfarin 10
mg qd.
In terms of his [**Last Name (un) **], his Cr returned to baseline (1.0) with IVF.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further management
and evaluation by Cardiac surgery for possible valve
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
Relevant Labs:

[**2172-6-24**] 06:20AM BLOOD HIV Ab-NEGATIVE

Imaging:

CT head w/ and w/o contrast [**6-22**]
FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect or major vascular territorial infarction.  No
evidence of enhancing mass lesion or rim-enhancing fluid
collections is seen.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and configuration.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  There is no fracture.  Imaged paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells reveal air-fluid levels in the ethmoid air
cells, with left greater than right partial opacification.
Inspissated secretions are seen in the sphenoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of enhancing or ring-enhancing lesions
to suggest
abscess.

CT chest w/ contrast [**6-22**]:
1.  Soft tissue surrounding the aortic root.  Recommend
correlation to prior imaging to determine whether this finding
is old (postoperative) or new (infectious).  Of note, the CT
scanner containing the source data was
experiencing technical difficulties, and thus more detailed
images could not be retrieved.
2.  No evidence of lung, pleural or pericardial infection.
3.  Central lymphadenopathy predates surgery.

US left UE [**6-22**]:
FINDINGS:  There is no fluid collection identified.  Patent
veins with
hypoechoic halo suggests edema and more generally edematous
tissue in the
region of the patient's pain suggest inflammation.  Trace
synovial fluid is demonstrated (1 mm).

US LLE [**6-22**]:
FINDINGS:  No abscess or fluid collection is identified.
Substantial
inflammation or phlegmon cannot be excluded, however, by
ultrasound.

Chest x-ray [**6-24**]:

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Changes of median sternotomy and aortic
valve
replacement are present.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are clear.  There are
no pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are noted in the lower
thoracic spine,
with anterior bridging osteophytes.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No thrombus or mass is seen in the left atrial
