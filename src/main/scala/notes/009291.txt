HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old man who
dropped some money outside a toll booth on the [**State 350**]
Turnpike.  He got out of his car to put the money into the
toll booth and suddenly fell to the ground and became
unresponsive.  When he arrived at the emergency room he was
found to be [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 3.  However, the patient
began moving but did not wake up.  Post receiving the history
from the wife the patient was known to have a lens implant on
his right eye, which there was a question of blown pupil
initially.  He had a head CT which did not show any
intracranial blood.  However, a CT of the cervical spine
showed a type 2 Dens fracture.  However, while the patient
was in the emergency room he became suddenly bradycardic and
was ruling in for an myocardial infarction.  He was brought
emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to
undergo a cardiac angiogram.  He also had external pacers
placed down in the emergency room and was brought up to the
catheterization laboratory to have transvenous pacing done.
He received Dopamine while in the emergency room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is not significant.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for right hip
replacement, bilateral cataract surgery, right lens implant,
status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  100.4, heart rate of 48,
blood pressure 142/86, 12 and 95 percent.  This was prior to
his bradycardiac-asystole episode.  His right pupil was 8 mm,
not responsive due to lens implant.  Left pupil was 2 mm, not
responsive.  He had minimal withdrawal of his left upper
extremity, no response on his right upper extremity.  He
withdrew his bilateral lower extremities.

His white count 6.7, hematocrit was 41.6, platelets 206.
Sodium 135, 4.84 potassium, chloride 100, 24 for CO2, 16 for
BUN, 1.0 for creatinine, 168 for platelets.  CK initially was
137.  CT of his spine showed an odontoid fracture
approximately 5 mm of displacement off the dens, posteriorly
calcified along the ligamentous canal at approximately 11 mm
with diffuse cervical spondylosis and autofused segments.

Given the extent of the CT scan the patient after his cardiac
catheterization procedure had a Halo placed to prevent any
further movement of his neck until he go to the operating
room.  He tolerated his cardiac catheterization without
difficulty and had a temporary transvenous pacer placed at
the rate of 60 on his first hospital day on [**1-27**].  He was on
some propofol drip for agitation and he was ventilated.  He
was nonverbal but responded to noxious stimuli.  On [**1-27**] he
was started on Solu-Medrol protocol for possible cord
compression.  He was unable to have an MRI due to the fact
that he had a pacer placed.  On his neurologic examination he
was found to open his eyes to voice but doesn't follow
commands.  He had some spontaneous movements in his bilateral
lower extremities and his left arm.  He was not moving his
right arm.  On [**1-28**] his cervical spine x-ray showed good
alignment in the Halo traction.  He was found to open his
eyes, follow commands in all four, was not antigravity.  He
had equivocal movements in the right and downgoing toes on
the left.  No clonus.

On [**1-29**] he underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker.
The Mode type is DDD.  The lower rate is at 70, the upper
tracking rate of 120.  The AV intervals of 150 milliseconds,
DV 120 milliseconds.  The type of pacemaker is a Medtronics
Sigma Dual Chamber right response pacemaker, bipolar
connector, 3.2 mm low profile, serial number [**Serial Number 59517**].  He
underwent that procedure without any difficulties.

On [**1-30**] off his sedation for an hour his eyes would open.
He would move his feet spontaneously, withdraw his lower
extremities.  However, he had significant paresis of his
upper extremities.  On [**1-31**] it was noting that the patient
was biting his tongue significantly causing swelling of his
tongue and there was some tongue necrosis noted from the
previous day.  Many bite blocks had been placed.  On [**1-31**]
there was a long discussion with the wife and daughter of Mr.
[**Known lastname **] along with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**], the critical care attending
for trauma, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and social work.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] explained
the poor prognosis with the central cortex syndrome and from
the fracture that he most likely will require long term
ventilation and will not regain the ability and move his
upper extremities.  He will require full time nursing care
for the remainder of his life.  The family opted to continue
with full treatment and opted for surgery to stabilize his
neck.

On [**2-1**] it was noted that off propofol the patient was much
brighter, his eyes were open and was moving around attend
examiner, followed fingers in all directions with his eyes
bilaterally, moved his feet fairly briskly spontaneously and
it was hard to determine if he was moving them on command.
His neurologic examination on [**2-2**] was that his upper
extremities revealed 0 to 1 out of 5 and he was able to
wiggle his toes vigorously he did not have any antigravity
strength in his bilateral lower extremities.  On [**2114-2-6**] Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was treated for pneumonia.  He had chest x-ray that
showed infiltrates.  He also had fever and positive sputum.
He was started on a  ten day course of levofloxacin.  He
remained neurologically unchanged and moving his bilateral
lower extremities to command at times.

On [**2114-2-7**] he was noted to be awake, alert, interactive,
blinks eyes appropriately, really no change.  He had paretic
bilateral upper extremities.  In lower extremities he was
still able to wiggle his toes and internally rotate.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] had another meeting with his wife, daughter and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 26687**], one of the critical care attending.  The family again
wanted to be aggressive with their management and have a PEG,
tracheostomy and spinal stabilization done.  On [**2-8**] oral
maxillary surgery saw the patient regarding his necrotic
tongue.  The felt he needed debridement in the operating
room.  On [**2-9**] both oral maxillary surgery debrided his
tongue and at the same time he had an occiput to C3 fusion by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] and a PEG and tracheostomy.  There were no acute
complications with all procedures.  Postoperatively he would
obey his commands.  He would open his eyes and moved his
bilateral lower extremities spontaneously, trace movement in
his left upper extremities.  His dressing was clean, dry and
intact.

On the afternoon of [**2-10**] he was noted to have some slightly
deceased movement than he had previously before surgery.  He
was still following commands.  However, his upper extremity
had slight movement of his left upper extremity, plegic on
the right.  He withdrew his bilateral lower extremities.
However, that was decreased than preoperatively.  His CT of
his cervical spine at 3 A.M. showed no gross hematoma, no
gross evidence of cord compression.  On [**2114-2-12**] his
ventilator settings were changed to SIMV which he tolerated
well.  He had pseudomonas noted in his sputum for which he
continued to receive Levaquin and also Zosyn.  His tube
feedings were at goal.  His incision from surgery was intact.
His Hemovac was discontinued on [**2-12**].  His motor examination
on [**2-13**] - his eyes would open.  He was awake, appropriate,
weakly withdraws bilateral lower extremities 2 out of 5 and
was plegic in his bilateral upper extremities.  On [**2-15**] he
underwent an inferior vena cava filter placement and a PICC
line placement for long term bed rest and for intravenous
antibiotics.

His neurologic examination on [**2114-2-20**] shows that he is plegic
in his upper extremities and had slight withdrawal of his
lower extremities.  His tube feedings are now at goal at 80.
He was stooling small amounts so he was started recently on
