History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year old with a history of hypertension, type II
diabetes mellitus, CRI who initially presented on [**2189-3-29**] with
headache following mechanical falls at home 2 weeks ago. His
wife notes that he has had three falls in the last 2 weeks. His
first fall was two weeks ago while he was being weighed on a
scale. He lost his balance, fell backwards and hit the back of
his head on a shelf. His second fall was one week ago, he was on
his way to the bathroom with his walker and fell on the left
side of his head. His third fall was three days prior to
admission, he was on his walker when his wife noted that his
legs buckled. No head trauma was noted following this third
fall. His wife reports witnessing these falls and denies LOC,
associated chest pain, SOB, palpitations, and lightheadedness.
He walks with a walker at baseline. His wife notes that in the
last two weeks, she has noticed a deterioriation in his mental
status. She has found him increasingly confused and tired. He
has also been reporting headaches for the last two weeks. 3 days
prior to admission, he also began to have nausea and vomitting
along with the headache. His last INR at home was 4.3 five days
prior to admisison. He was brought to the [**Hospital **] Hospital ED on
[**2189-3-30**] where he was noted to have a SDH.
.
He received 5 mg vitamin K at the OSH prior to transfer to the
[**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he [**Last Name (un) **] given FFP x 4 units. He also
received Lasix IV and Dilantin. He was seen by the neurosurgury
team who recommended NSICU and he was subsequently transferred
to the ICU. He was deemed stable from a neurosurgical
perspective on [**3-30**] and there were plans for his discharge.
However early morning on [**3-31**], he began to have black guaiac
positive stools and had atrial fibrillation with RVR to the
130s. His coumadin has been held and he received 10mg SC vitamin
K on presentation ([**2189-3-29**]) and an additional 10mg SC vitamin K
on [**3-31**]. Additionally, he received 1 unit FFP on [**2189-3-31**]. INR is
currently 1.7.
.
Of note, he has been on home hospice for heart failure since 3
weeks ago. On review of systems, his wife denies fever, chills,
cough, weight loss, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.


Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation

standing K repletion).
3. Hypertension

Physical Exam:
T: 100.4 at 8 AM, T 99.6 BP: 150/60 HR: 88 (88-102) R: 16
O2Sats: 99% 4L
Gen: Sleeping, somnolent but arousable, falling asleeping
throughout the exam
HEENT: Pupils: R 3-2 mm, L 2-1.5 EOMs intact
Neck: Supple.
Lungs: Clear to ascultation anteriorly
Cardiac: irregular, irreg. S1/S2.
Abd: Soft, NT, BS+, obese
Extrem: LE venous stasis changes bilaterally.
Neuro: CNII-XII grossly in tact. Moves all extremities freely.
Neurological exam limited by somnolence.

[**2189-3-29**] CT head:
1. Acute right-sided subdural hematoma, stable when compared to
outside study.
2. Bilateral superior ophthalmic vein enlargement, left greater
than right. These findings can be seen with carotid cavernous
fistula and/or cavernous sinus thrombosis. Clinical correlation
is suggested.
.
[**2189-3-31**] CT head: Stable appearance of right-sided acute subdural
hematoma. Unchanged left greater than right superior ophthalmic
vein enlargement.
.
[**2189-4-10**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**3-30**], the pulmonary
vessels now appear to be essentially within normal limits.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. No evidence of
acute focal pneumonia at this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o male with a history of type II DM, congestive heart
failure (class IV), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic
renal insufficiency, who was admited with a supratherapeutic INR
and SDH following fall, complicated by intermittent seizure
activity.
.
SDH with opthal vein engorgement: His repeat CT scan was stable
on [**3-31**].  However, he was found to have new seizures on [**4-3**],
with focal motor activity of LUE, suggesting that SDH may be
progressing.  We attempted to reimage his head on [**4-3**], and
onward, but due to his tenuous respiratory status and severe
orthopnea, repeat CT was unfeasible.  Per extensive discussion
with his wife about pt's comfort, decision was made to provide
supportive care with management of seizure activity and pain.
He was continued on valproic acid for seizure prophylaxis.  He
was given ativan 0.5 prn for persistent seizure activity lasting
for a prolonged period of time (>2-3 mins).
.
Pain: He had continued headaches and back pain throughout this
hospitalization.  As noted above, goals of care shifted towards
focusing on pt's comfort, even if it meant that this would be at
the cost of increased sedation.  He was started on concentrated
morphine.  He has a peripheral IV if morphine gtt in case
morphine gtt is required.
.
GIB: There were concerns of melanic stools during this
hospitalization and likely UGIB on [**3-31**] on the neurosurgical
service.  He does have a long standing history of epistaxis,
this may explain his guaiac positive stools.   He remained
hemodynamically stable otherwise.  EGD could not be done on [**3-30**]
due to desats when lying flat.  On the evening of [**3-30**] with hct
drop to 24 from baseline of 27-28.  He received 1 unit pRBC on
[**3-30**] with appropriate response.  As above, with changes in goals
of care, lab draws were discontinued on [**4-10**].
.
CHF: Based on OSH echo results, mainly diastolic, with
relatively preserved EF. Prior to admission, at home with
hospice for class IV HF.  At home on lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
metolazone. Diuretics were held in the setting of metabolic
abnormalities (primarly hypernatremia) and GIB.  He appeared
fluid overloaded on [**4-4**] and in  respiratory distress and his
home regimen of lasix reintroduced.  On [**4-14**], diuretics were
discontinued following meetings with his wife who expressed her
wishes to discontinue all medications that could potentially
prolong his life.  Diuretics and anti-hypertensives were
discontinued at this time.
.
Atrial Fibrillation:  On admission he was rate controlled on
digoxin, CCB, and BB.  However, due to change in goals of care,
his rate control agents were discontinued.
.
Pt is DNR/DNI, with comfort measures only.  His current
medications include keppra for seizure prophylaxis, ativan for
prolonged seizures, and morphine for comfort.
