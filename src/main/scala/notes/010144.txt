History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 83y/o lady with severe asthma and bronchiectasis
with ~6 admissions in the past 1.5 years for cough/dyspnea in
the setting of pseudomonal infection and H1N1, who presents with
cough, dyspnea, and fatigue.  She was in her usual state of
health (no dyspnea, using nebs and home O2 as needed), until 3
days ago when she started experiencing cough productive of
yellow sputum.  Her breathing has been comfortable except when
she has coughing spells, at which point she feels dyspneic with
chest tightness.  She [**Last Name (un) 19692**] brought to the ED due to worsening
dyspnea while coughing and fatigue.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 100.8 rectal, 119, 147/78,
31-41, 94% on NRB.  She was extensively wheezy on exam, and
received nebs, 125mg methylprednisolone, levaquin, ceftriaxone,
ASA.  EKG sinus tach at 111 without acute changes.  She was
stable in ED with sats of 100% on NRB but hypoxic on RA with
PaO2 of 53.  Given concern for tachypnea and increased work of
breathing with low reserve, she was admitted to the ICU for
monitoring. The patient is DNR/DNI.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she is without complaints.  She is on 4L NC,
feeling at her baseline level of breathing comfort when she is
not coughing.
.

infection/inflammation/bronchiectasis; possible consolidation at
RLL


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 83y/o lady with asthma and bronchiectasis, who
has had Pseudomonal and H1N1 infection, presenting with
productive cough, hypoxia, and leukocytosis likely due to new
onset infection triggering a worsening of underlying obstructive
lung disease/bronchiectasis.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory distress: Given her
cough/fever/leukocytosis, she most likely has acute
bronchiectasis flare and possibly focal pneumonia.  She has
known bronchiectasis, with past pansensitive Pseudomonal
infection.  Lack of myalgias makes influenza less likely.
Technically meets SIRS criteria, but does have tachycardia at
baseline.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was able to be weaned to 2L
NC (home level).  She continued to have bothersome cough; sputum
sample was collected and she received Guaifenisin.  She was
treated with antibiotics: Cipro and Cefepime for Pseudomonal
coverage, and Vancomycin given recent & multiple admissions
(plan was for 7 day course).  She was diffusely wheezy on exam
and was also given steroids (Methylprednisolone 125mg IV q8H).
She was started on standing Xopenex nebs and PRN Albuterol nebs.
 Finally, she was treated with chest PT and incentive
spirometry.  Her respiratory status was stable overnight and she
was transferred out of the ICU the next day to the medical
floor.  As her sputum cultures returned with pan-sensitive
pseudomonas, her antibiotics were narrowed to Cefepime for a
planned 10-day course.  A PICC line was placed.  Her wheezing
and cough improved throughout her hospitalization, as did her O2
saturation.  She was discharged on 2 L NC of O2 (home level) and
was satting in the mid 90% on 2 L.  She was also discharged on a
long steroid taper, with close f/u with her PCP and
pulmonologist.
.
#. Leukocytosis: chronic, stable.  No other infectious foci was
detected.
.
#. Sinus Tachycardia: has history of tachycardia and is on
Diltiazem XR at home. Currently may be response to infection.
At home she was on Dilt XR 180mg at home; upon arrival to the
ICU she was increased to Diltiazem 60mg PO QID.  This was
transitioned back to her home dose prior to discharge, with
baseline HR in the 100s.
.
#. HTN: continued on diltiazem.
.
#. CKD: stable Cr at baseline
