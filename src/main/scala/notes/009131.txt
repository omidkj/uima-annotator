Patient recently discharged to [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house after an admission
for FTT and PEG tube placement. Per nursing at [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house,
patient experienced GI upset on [**2-17**]; vomiting large amount of
TF. Received anti-emetics and nebs. CXR on [**2-17**] slighly
bilateral lobe atelectasis; no pulmonary edema; [**2-18**] CBC notable
for WBC 11.9. Started on cipro on [**2-18**]; cultures revealed
resistance and transitioned to Bactrim. Per rehab no furter
episodes of vomiting. Today at rehab noted to be warm to touch.
T 102.4 VS: 163/108, 132HR, RR22 sat 87-89%2L NC. Exam noted for
inspiratory wheeze. No cough. Decision made to send to ED for
evaluation. On arrival EMS noted her to be dyspneic, tachypneic
to the 40s with O2 sat of 80%RA which improved to >90 on NRB.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.3 120 140/85 initially on 100%NRB
but weaned to 4L. Labs notable for a grossly positive UA,
lactate 2.2, VBG 7.45 pCO2 39 pO2 40, creatinine 1.2 (bl
0.8-1.1), WBC 10.2 73%N. CXR showed left lung consolidation.
Exam notable for wheezy with crackles L>R. Pt given duonebs on
arrival, with improved breath sounds but stable to increasing
tachypnea. Patient received tylenol, albuterol and ipratropium
nebs, levo, vanc, and ceftriaxone. Of note, patient on Bactrim
DS, started on [**2105-2-19**].  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2299**], no sick contacts.

On arrival to the MICU, patient without complaint. Oriented to
place, person; denied SOB, CP, palpitations, n/v/d, abdominal

DIAGNOSTICS:
CXR [**2105-2-22**] - The heart and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits and unchanged from prior exam. An ill-defined
streaky opacity in the left mid lung is nonspecific but could
represent an area of aspiration or infection.  Recommend
follow-up to resolution. There is no large pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. A circular density projecting over the left upper
abdomen query G-tube.
CXR [**2105-2-23**] - IMPRESSION: 1. Stable cardiac and mediastinal
contours. There is an evolving left mid lung airspace opacity as
well as increasing opacification at the left base with probable
associated left effusion. These findings may represent areas of
atelectasis, although pneumonia and/or aspiration cannot be
excluded. The right lung is grossly clear. No pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax appreciated.
CXR [**2105-2-24**] - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
no relevant
change. Areas of atelectasis and bilateral parenchymal
opacities,
predominating in the peribronchial lung areas, of unchanged
severity and
almost unchanged distribution. The changes could reflect
pneumonia. Slightly increasing atelectasis in the retrocardiac
lung areas, potentially, a small pleural effusion on the left.
Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
evidence of pulmonary edema. Unchanged course of the right-sided
PICC line.
KUB [**2105-2-24**] - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
2. G-tube in the expected location of the stomach.
3. No pneumoperitoneum.
CXR [**2105-2-24**] - IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-22**]
through 21.
Mild vascular congestion has improved since [**2-24**], but
small left
pleural effusion has increased. If there is pulmonary edema, it
is minimal at the left lung base, where one also sees bands of
atelectasis. Heart size is top normal. Thoracic aorta is
generally large, tortuous, and heavily calcified. No
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
88yoF with dementia, FTT s/p PEG in early [**Month (only) 956**] h/w fever,
hypoxia and tachypnea suggestive of pneumonia.

# Sepsis secondary to PNA: Fever, shortness of breath and
streaky opacity on CXR suggestive of infectious etiology, likely
bacterial. On arrival, patient was tachypneic with hypoxia to
80s on room air. Her hypoxia and tachypnea resolved with BiPap,
which was quickly weaned to nasal cannula the morning after
admission. Acuity of the event and quickness of resolution
suggestive of aspiration for which patient is at high risk given
her underlying dementia. PE and volume overload seemed to be
less likely. Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics
with vancomyin, cefepime and levofloxacin which was narrowed to
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP. Patient also has possible
underlying COPD and her breathing improved with standing
nebulizer treatment as well, though her presentation was not
felt to be primarily a COPD exacerbation. BNP was elevated so
there was likely a minor element of vascular congestion
