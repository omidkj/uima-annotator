History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92802**] is a 63 year old lady with a history of
polycystic kidney disease and resulting nephrectomies and end
stage liver disease. She presented to the ED today at the
request of her nephrologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4883**]) after an episode of
hypotension to the 60s systolic yesterday at dialysis. The
patient reports consistently low blood pressures in ths 60s-100s
systolic. Of note, the patient was found to have a clot in her
RUE fistula yesterday morning and had temporary HD access placed
yesterday evening without complication.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.9 120 60/p 22. A diagnostic
paracentesis was performed. The patient received a 250mL bolus
of NS for SBP in the 60s which did correct her to the 80s. She
also received Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone (1g each) and 10mg of
Decadron as a stress dose given her chronic steroid use.
Transfer vitals: VS: 120 72/48 22 100%RA
On arrival to the MICU, the patient appears quite comfortable.
She complains of some abdominal discomfort (therapeutic
paracentesis scheduled for today independently) and otherwise
denies chest pain, dyspnea greater than baseline, changes in her
chronically loose stools, or any symptoms of viral illness.
Per initial Nephrology notes, the patient is normally
hypotensive but has not been tachycardic in the past which
prompted their concern.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
