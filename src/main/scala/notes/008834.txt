HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old female
with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
with an FEV-1 measured at .66 liters, on home oxygen, who was
admitted to the hospital for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare.  She has multiple recent admissions over the
past nine months for similar symptoms, requiring Intensive
Care Unit stays.  The patient now presented following several
days of lethargy and upper respiratory infection symptoms
accompanied by increasing shortness of breath and declining
mental status to the point of obtundation.

On presentation to the Emergency Room, the patient was
afebrile, with heart rate in the 110s and blood pressure in
the 140s/50s, breathing at a rate of 45 breaths per minute,
with oxygen saturations of 69% on room air.  She appeared
obtunded.  Her breath sounds were globally diminished.  She
had a white count to 13.7, with 90% neutrophils.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with an old right
bundle branch block.  An arterial blood gas performed on 100%
non-rebreather showed a pH of 7.17, PCO2 of 136, PO2 of 73,
with a calculated bicarbonate of 52.  The patient was placed
on BiPAP for a period of time.  A repeat arterial blood gas
showed a pH of 7.31, PCO2 of 95, PO2 of 67, with a calculated
bicarbonate of 50.  The patient had difficulty keeping a
BiPAP mask on her face, and was subsequently intubated and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV-1 of
0.66 and FVC of 1.36, ratio measured 78% of predicted.  She
is on 3 liters of oxygen at home via nasal cannula.
2.  Colon cancer, [**Location (un) **] Stage A status post low anterior
resection in [**2098-4-6**]
3.  Status post seizure in [**2097**] from hyponatremia,
serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
4.  Osteoarthritis
5.  Low back pain
6.  Osteoporosis
7.  Old lacunar infarct in the right corona radiata

ALLERGIES:  Doxycycline

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol two puffs three times a day, Atrovent
two puffs three times a day, Serevent two puffs twice a day,
Ranitidine 150 twice a day, Klonopin twice daily, and
Ritalin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her children.  She
has a history of smoking one pack per day for 20 years.  She
stopped 30 years ago.  She has had no occupational exposures.
She is followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], her pulmonologist is Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**].

FAMILY HISTORY:   Positive for tuberculosis and lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient arrived to the Intensive
Care Unit febrile and hypotensive.  Temperature was 101.8,
heart rate 94, blood pressure 82/46.  The patient was
intubated on assist control ventilation 500 x 14, FIO2 of
1.00, PEEP of 5.  Peak pressures measured 40, with plateau of
24.  The skin was warm and dry.  She was anicteric.  There
were no rashes noted.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
The patient was intubated.  Pupils were reactive to light.
The oropharynx appeared dry.  The neck was supple.  The neck
veins were flat.  The lungs were clear anteriorly
bilaterally.  No wheezes were appreciated.  The heart was
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
The abdomen had bowel sounds present, soft, nontender.
Extremities:  No edema.  Neurologically, the patient moved
all extremities.  She withdrew to pain and blinked in
response to voice.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count was 13.7,
hematocrit 42.4, platelets 320, 90% neutrophils, 4.3%
lymphocytes.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 87,
bicarbonate 48, BUN 22, creatinine 0.7, glucose 153.
Arterial blood gas on the above ventilator settings showed a
pH of 7.48, PCO2 of 45, and PO2 of 435.  Calcium was 7.9,
phosphate was 1.6, magnesium 1.6.  Electrocardiogram showed
sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute with a right bundle
branch block, left atrial abnormality, nonspecific ST/T wave
changes, overall stable compared to [**2102-2-13**].
Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.025, protein 30,
trace ketones, pH 6.0, [**7-17**] white blood cells, no bacteria, 0
red blood cells, 0-2 epithelial cells, [**4-11**] hyaline casts, 0-2
granular casts, occasional calcium oxide crystals.  Chest
x-ray showed emphysematous changes without focal
consolidation, biapical pleural thickening, no focal
consolidations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management.  Blood cultures
were obtained, and the patient was started on levofloxacin
empirically.  The patient was bolused with fluids to manage
her hypotension likely the result of volume redistribution in
the setting of intubation and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  Her electrolytes were repleted, and she was
maintained on metered dose inhalers as well as nebulizer
treatments as needed.  Multiple blood cultures were drawn and
grew positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus in two
bottles from separate sites.  She was treated with a short
course of vancomycin.  No skin source could be identified.
The patient became afebrile.  She was started on Solu-Medrol
as adjunctive treatment for her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, underwent diuresis and was successfully extubated on
[**9-13**].  She required mask BiPAP for several hours
following the extubation for borderline oxygen saturations in
the mid-80s.

The patient continued to be diuresed and was eventually
maintained on 3 liters nasal cannula, with oxygen saturations
in the mid-90s.  An echocardiogram was obtained, which showed
a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, with
moderate pulmonary hypertension and trace aortic
regurgitation.  Her steroids were tapered.  She demonstrated
some restlessness and disorientation while in the Intensive
Care Unit, which waxed and waned and improved over time.  She
did demonstrate a run of multifocal atrial tachycardia during
an albuterol nebulizer treatment, which responded to oral
metoprolol.  A baseline arterial blood gas on 3 liters nasal
cannula was obtained, which showed a pH of 7.43, PCO2 of 53,
PO2 of 87, with a calculated bicarbonate of 37.  Her steroids
were tapered.

She now awaits further evaluation by Physical Therapy and
will likely require [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Serevent two puffs twice a day
2.  Atrovent two puffs every six hours
3.  Albuterol two puffs every four hours as needed

5.  Klonopin 0.25 mg by mouth twice a day
6.  Prednisone 30 mg by mouth for three days, then 20 mg by
mouth for three days, then 10 mg by mouth for three days,
then stop

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged shortly from the
hospital, likely to a rehabilitation facility.  She is to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**] as well as her pulmonologist,
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**].
