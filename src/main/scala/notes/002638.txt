CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST ([**2161-5-23**]):
Minimally displaced comminuted nasal bone fracture. No other
evidence of acute fracture.

NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD ([**2161-5-23**]): There is a large subdural
hematoma covering the entire right convexity, which measures up
to 2 cm from the inner table, which causes 6 mm shift of
normally midline structures, unchanged since [**2161-5-23**]. There is
mild compression of the right lateral ventricle without evidence
of subfalcine or uncal herniation. The bony calvarium is intact.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

Non-contrast CT of the head ([**2161-6-3**]):
1. Increased leftward shift of midline structures, with
increased subfalcine and stable transtentorial herniation. There
is increased effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle.
2. Stable appearance to right convexity subdural hematoma
without evidence for new foci of hemorrhage.

Non-contrast CT of the head ([**2161-6-5**]):  Status post evacuation
of right frontal subdural hematoma with improvement in mass
effect with reduction in subfalcine herniation with an
improvement in leftward midline shift, now 9 mm. No evidence of
acute hemorrhage.

Non-contrast CT head ([**2161-6-8**]):  Status post right craniotomy
for evacuation of right frontal subdural hematoma, now with
improvement of midline shift, now only 4 mm in leftward
direction. There is no evidence of an acute hemorrhage.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2161-5-22**]):  Vascular engorgement without
overt CHF.

Echocardiogram ([**2161-5-25**]):  Severe/critical aortic stenosis(valve
area 0.6cm2). At least moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.

CXR 2V ([**2161-6-8**]):  Interval improvement in bibasilar atelectasis
or consolidation, and pleural fluid.

RUQ ultrasound ([**2161-6-9**]):
1. Normal Doppler study.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Mild calcifications of the abdominal aorta, without
aneurysmal dilatation.
4. Calcified granuloma within the liver.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 year-old female with history of pulmonary embolism and atrial
fibrillation on coumadin admitted [**2161-5-23**] following fall. On
admission, she was found to have a subdural hematoma which was
evacuated. Hospital course was complicated by respiratory
distress requiring intubation, ventilator associated pneumonia,
and UTI. Brief hospital summary is as follows.

1. Sub-dural hematoma: Pt was admitted through the emergency
department after being brought in s/p fall. She was intubated in
the ED for respiratory distress and increasing agitation. Head
CT revealed acute on chronic SDH on the right. She had been on
aspirin, plavix and coumadin and her anticoagulation was
reversed and her labs were followed closely. She was admitted to
the  trauma ICU and after being cleared from a trauma
standpoint, she was admitted to neurosurgery. Extubation was
considered on hospital day #2 however she went into pulmonary
edema and the extubation was not attempted.  Her management
continued to be primarily medical. Extubation was again
considered [**5-26**] but CXR showed fluid and she remained intubated.
 Her neurologic exam improved on this day - her eyes were open,
she attended examiner and followed commands with motors
appearing full. Extubation again consid
