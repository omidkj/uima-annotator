Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, weight gain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram
DC cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
 82 yo man w/ hx of CHF (EF 40-45% [**2116-6-23**]), NSTEMI on [**2116-3-2**],
afib on coumadin and COPD who presents from home with weight
gain and worsening SOB. Per the patient's son, pt was seen in
cardiology clinic yesterday and was supposed to have undergone
cardioversion, but had a subtheraputic INR. Over the past 2
weeks he has been having steady weight gain now 12 lbs above dry
weight (dry wt 187 lbs at last d/c last month) in the setting of
increased fluid intake. Also has been using home O2 all day
instead of just QHS for the past 2 days. He has not been having
CP. States SOB has been constant, he states he gets winded going
up a flight of stairs at home. He has a chronic cough that is
unchanged. He sleeps on one pillow with a blanket under at
night. States he is able to lie flat without increased symptoms.

He lives at home with son and wife, his son notes he found a
pack of cigs a few weeks ago that was missing 6 cigs (son feels
pt was smoking though the pt denies). Son also notes the pt has
been trying to follow a low sodium / fluid restricted diet, but
he has been drinking more fluids recently.
Saw PCP yesterday and cardiologist earlier this month. Have been
considering cardioversion for his A Fib but his INR has been
subtherapeutic. PCP increased his lasix to 80mg PO daily
yesterday.
Pt denies F/C/S, abd pain, change in bowel habits. He does not
like hospitalizations.

Reports:
CXR: Upright AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low
lung
volumes. Hazy indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels may
indicate mild
edema, particularly in light of given history. No pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax is noted. The heart size is moderately enlarged and
there is
tortuosity of the aorta, both exaggerated by the low lung
volumes.

TEE:The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage has an accessory lobe
(normal variant). The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is
good (>20 cm/s). A small color Doppler signal of left-to-right
flow across the interatrial septum is seen at rest consistent
with a small secundum atrial septal defect. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Right
ventricle with borderline normal free wall function. There are
extensive simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
IMPRESSION: Small secundum type ASD with left-to-right shunt at
rest. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA/RA/RAA. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Extensive, simple aortic atheroma.

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is color Doppler evidence of a small
interatrial shunt (stretched patent foramen ovale).There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal to mid inferior akinesis/hypokinesis, [**Last Name (un) **] inferoseptal
akinesis/hypokinesis and basal to mid inferolateral akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension
