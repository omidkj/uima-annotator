right upper quadrant pain

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old male with PMH significant for COPD,
obesity, and diabetes c/b peripheral neuropathy who was recently
discharged on a steroid taper and azithromycin for a COPD
exacerbation on [**10-20**] now presenting with RUQ abdominal pain that
has been increasing in severity since [**10-18**]. He says that he
first noted RUQ abdominal pain at the beginning of his COPD
exacerbation on [**10-18**], but felt like the pain was mild from
coughing and gasping for air. He was discharged on [**10-20**] and
developed increased pain at home to the point where he could not
even dress himself secondary to the pain. He describes the pain
as constant and it is difficult for him to find a comfortable
position. The pain sometimes feels like a burning sensation and
is often [**10-18**] when he positions himself in certain ways. The
pain is localized over the lower 2 ribs on his right side.
Placing a heating pad on the area helped somewhat at home. The
pain was so debilitating, he could not go to the pharmacy to
pick up his meds and therefore has not taken his steroids or
azithromycin today. He is intolerant to oral oxycodone,
Percocet, and Vicodin for pain control in the past namely
because he says it causes him to have a personality change.
Of note, the patient also mentions losing control of his bowels
for the first time ever today around noon. He felt that he
needed to have a bowel movement, but when he got up he had
already gone in his pants. He is not experiencing any increase
in his chronic back pain and has not noticed any urinary
incontinence. He has also not had any decreased motor strength.
At baseline he has severe peripheral neuropathy and describes
loss of sensation in his legs up to his mid-thighs, but this is
at baseline.
As far as his COPD exacerbation, the patient continues to
improve. However, he is having difficulty expectorating his
secretions secondary to the pain. He is also having difficulties
taking deep breaths with the pain. He also feels as though his
abdomen is more bloated tha usual.
.
In the ED, VS were: T=98.3, HR=79, BP=140/80, RR=22, POx=98% on
2L NC. He appeared uncomfortable secondary to pain and was given
12 mg of morphine as well as Toradol with moderate effect. He
was also noted to be 94% on RA and was therefore given 2L of NC.

.
On the floor, the patient continues to have RUQ pain with
difficulty taking deep breaths and clearing his secretions
secondary to the pain.

[**2148-10-21**], CTU Abd/pelvis, CTA chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. No evidence of renal calculi or appendicitis.
3. Herniation of the right lung through the right posterolateral
eighth and ninth ribs, may account for patient's symptoms of
right upper quadrant pain. Lucency along right inferior
hemithorax chest wall on chest radiograph performed same date is
new since prior chest radiograph of [**2148-10-18**] raising concern for
recent development. The findings are also new since CT abdomen
of [**2143-2-14**]

is unchanged since [**2143**].

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 year old male with PMH significant for COPD,
obesity, and diabetes c/b peripheral neuropathy who was recently
discharged on a steroid taper and azithromycin for a COPD
exacerbation on [**10-20**] now presenting with RUQ pain that has been
increasing in severity since [**10-18**].

#. Lower rib cage/RUQ pain: On imaging it appeared as though the
patient has herniation of his right lung through his posterior
chest wall.  EKG without ischemic changes and cardiac bio
markers were negative.  Pain control was initiated, but pt
reported  a previous poor reaction to Vicodin, Percocet,
Oxycodone, including personality changes/agitation.  Thoracic
surgery was consulted, and initial plan for conservative
management.  Pain service consulted for pain recs, but pt
declined PCA, and pain team felt pt too high-risk for
