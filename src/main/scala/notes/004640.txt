Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2134-8-11**] -  Repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with a
28-mm Vascutek (Cosselli) graft with multiple side branches to
the visceral vessels and partial right heart bypass.


History of Present Illness:
40 year old female who has undergone repair of type a dissection
that represented abdominal pain with plan for intervention on
thoracic aneurysm dilitation.  However during that admission in
[**2134-6-22**] she had sternal wire removal and was discharged for
readmission now for treatment and heparin
bridge prior to surgery.  She continues with abdominal pain [**1-23**]
times a week sharp lasting less than 30 minutes, continues on
oxycodone. Admiited now for surgical management of her
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.


Past Medical History:
HTN
Marfan's syndrome
- first evaluated at the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-/2132**] for evaluation of a
Type B aortic dissection
- emergent repair of her type A dissection in [**1-/2134**] with
ascending aorta replacement and CABG x 1
Asthma
Hashimoto's thyroiditis
Hyperprolactinemia
Arthritis
Loss of vision in the right eye
Borderline ovarian cancer s/p LSO
- Recent pelvic ultrasound returned normal
Endometriosis
- Controlled with Implanon
Depression
.
Past Surgical History:
Bentall procedure with CABG x 1
- Total arch replacement grafts to the LCCA and the innominate
artery and Coronary artery bypass grafting w/ reverse saphenous
vein graft from the neo ascending aorta to the LAD
D&C with left salpingo-oophorectomy
Polypectomy
- HSC polypectomy - [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
- Abd MMY - [**Hospital1 756**]
- Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions of adhesionOA and Left
Salpingo Oophorectomy for Borderline Ovarian Tumor
- aortic dissection repair [**1-/2134**]


Social History:
Patient lives with husband in [**Name (NI) 577**].  She is not employed.
She denies tobacco or ETOH or illicits.


Family History:
Cousin with Marfans, Ao dissection, and MI.  Uncles with [**Name2 (NI) **].
No family hx of ovarian or breast cancer.

Pertinent Results:
[**2134-8-10**] ECHO
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount
of regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic
valve.] The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2134-8-13**] Abdominal Ultrasound
No evidence for biliary ductal dilation or hepatic arterial
compromise. Given the technically limited nature of this
examination, there is high concern for compromised hepatic
arterial flow, cross-sectional (CTA) imaging is recommended.

[**2134-8-14**] Abdominal MRA
1. Status post thoracoabdominal aortic graft placement with
grafting of the
celiac artery, SMA, and renal arteries. There is slight mural
irregularity at the sites of the anastomoses, however, all of
these vessels remain patent.
2. Slight heterogeneous perfusion on the left lateral segment of
the liver,
of uncertain significance.
3. Left-sided pleural effusion/seroma with associated
atelectasis.
4. Slightly decreased enhancement of the medial left kidney,
which may be due to ischemia.
5. Proteinaceous or hemorrhagic left renal cysts.

[**2134-8-19**] Gallbladder Ultrasound:
1. Limited study, without evidence for biliary ductal
dilatation. 2. Main hepatic artery and main portal vein appear
grossly patent. Slight blunting of the systolic peak and
notching of the waveform at early diastole are of uncertain
significance, and may relate to the altered anatomy from aortic
aneurysm repair and graft placement.
