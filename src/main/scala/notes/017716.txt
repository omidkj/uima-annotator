Chief Complaint:
Presyncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2158-8-28**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Pericardial Valve)
and Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing vein
graft to obtuse marginal and vein graft to right coronary
artery.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old female with known aortic stenosis. She
presented with presyncope in [**2158-5-28**]. Echocardiogram at that
time showed progression of her aortic valve disease - [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.5
cm2, mean 82mmHg, mild AI. She subsequently underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed a right dominant coronary system
with two vessel coronary artery disease - 50% lesion in the RCA,
70% lesion in the obtuse marginal. Based upon the above results,
she was referred for cardiac surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 120-140/57-60, 60-70, 14, 100% RA
General: Obese female in no acute distress
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD, transmitted murmurs noted
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, harsh systolic murmur radiating
to carotid region
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds, obese
Ext: Warm, tr edema. Superficial varicosities noted
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted

Pertinent Results:
[**8-28**] Echo: PREBYPASS: Due to patient's previous history of
gastric bypass TEE probe inserted into esophagous only. No
gastric views obtained.-limited study. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. MV leaflet opening is limited but
not stenotic (MVA~2.4cm2) There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: Preserved biventricular systolic function. There is
a well seated well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. No AI is visualized in the esophageal views but AI
cannot be ruled out secojndary to shadowing of the valve ring.
Study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass exam.
[**8-31**] CXR: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs compared to
[**2158-8-29**]. The heart size is moderately enlarged but
stable. The sternal sutures are intact. Aortic valve is in a
standard location. The bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal
atelectasis are unchanged. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission she was brought to
the operating room and underwent an aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. For surgical
details, please see separate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. She
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. Beta blockers and diuretics were started
and she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. She
gradually improved and worked with physical therapy for strength
and mobility. On post-op day five she appeared to be doing well
and was discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate
follow-up appointments.
