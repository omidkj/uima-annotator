History of Present Illness:
61 yo female with h/o DM2, COPD on home O2, h/o DVT/[**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**].  She underwent cholecystectomy
on [**2-1**] then represented to [**Hospital3 4107**] for abdominal pain.
She was found to have significant ileus and ascites, and
underwent exploratory laparotomy which showed a 2cm hole in the
base of the systic duct with 1 Liter bilious ascites.  There was
ischemic bowel with massive ileus and distention due to bile
peritonitis.  Her hospitalization was also complicated by a CVL
placement with subsequent pneumothorax. A left sided chest tube
was place, and also a right femoral line was placed. She is
being transferred here for [**Hospital3 **] in AM to fix the continued bile
leakage.  Of note, she has been treated with vancomycin,
metronidazole, and levofloxacin at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
peritonitis.
.
Currently, she states she is having severe pain in her abdomen.
She denies CP.  Her breathing is slightly labored, but she
thinks that's secondary to her large abdomen.  She otherwise
denies fevers, chills, headache, or any other symptoms.  She
request pain medications.  She was on a dilaudid PCA at the OSH.

.
Also on chroinc steroids for COPD.

[**Year (4 digits) **]:
Impression: Normal major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
Autotome 44 using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete opacification.  Slight
extravasation was noted at the cystic duct remnant.  The calibre
and course of the intrahepatic ducts and the CBD was normal; no
filling defects were noted.  A 10cm by 9mm Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary
stent was placed successfully.  Otherwise normal [**Doctor Last Name **] to third
part of the duodenum
.
[**2119-2-9**]
Chest x-ray

Tubing projected over the left lower hemithorax could be a
pleural drain,
impinges on the mediastinum and then could be folded quite
sharply, to the
point of occlusion. Clinical examination recommended. Thickening
of the left apical pleural margin extends into the mediastinum
is new concerning for hematoma related to line insertion
attempt. No radiopaque central venous catheter is seen. Mild
left lower lobe atelectasis is new. Heart size is normal.
Stomach is moderately distended with air and a right upper
quadrant drainage catheter is at the lower margin of the liver

.
[**2119-2-10**]

Left basal pleural tube is sharply folded as it impinges on the
mediastinum, and may be effectively occluded. Pleural effusion,
if any, is small. No pneumothorax. Lobular thickening of the
left apical pleural margin could be either loculated effusion or
extrapleural hematoma from attempted line placement, as
discussed with the house officer caring for this patient earlier
in the day. Severe left lung atelectasis is unchanged.
.
Marked azygos distention in part reflects supine positioning
nevertheless
indicates elevated central venous pressure or volume. The heart
is probably not enlarged.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:

63 y/o female with COPD,diabetes, and h/o DVT is transfered from
OSH after exploratory laparotomy for bile duct leak following
cholecystectomy, also s/p left CVL placement with subsequent PTX
s/p left chest tube placement, transferred here for [**Month/Day/Year **] to
address continued bile duct leak.  [**Month/Day/Year **] done and stent placed
without difficulty.  Patient electively intubated during
procedure and successfully extubated.

# Bile duct leak:
Patient underwent cholecystecomy on [**2-1**], followed by
exploratory laparotomy on [**2-7**] found to have 2 cm hole at cystic
duct with bilious drainiage, and 1L of bilious ascites, and
likely peritonitis given acute abdomen on vanco/levo/flagyl
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital1 **].  She remained hemodynamically
stable throughout hospital stay.  [**Hospital1 **] was performed on [**2119-2-10**]
and a stent successfully placed.  Antibiotics changed to
vanco/zosyn for better GNR coverage, as peritoneal fluid grew
GNRs, yet to be speciated.  She should have a repeat [**Date Range **] in 8
weeks to remove the stent and to reassess.  Her diet should be
advanced slowly as tolerated.

# Left Pneumothorax:
In context of subclavian attempt at OSH s/p chest tube
placement.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], x-ray revealed malpositioning
of chest tube.  Thoracics was consulted for removal.  On serial
chest x-rays here, PTX resolved.

# COPD:
Was intubated at [**Hospital1 **] postoperatively, but self extubated.
Transferred on ventimask 50% FIO2.   On chronic po steroids at
home, transitioned to IV regimen initially as she was NPO.
Should be transitioned back to her home regimen as tolerated.

# History of DVT/PE:
On coumadin as outpatient which was held in preparation for [**Hospital1 **]
and removal of chest tube.  Heparin resumed following these
procedures.
