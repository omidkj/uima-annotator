Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 -year-old
Russian female with a history of critical aortic stenosis,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass graft, who presents with
increasing shortness of breath and chest pain over the past
four days prior to admission.  The patient was recently
admitted for chest pain on [**2106-8-19**].  She had negative
CKs, but her troponin was 7.5.  During her stay the positive
troponin was not acted on and the discharge summary does not
comment on it.  An echocardiogram was done which revealed the
aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2 with an ejection fraction of
55%. The patient was sent home at this time.

The patient was seen in clinic on [**2106-9-6**] with a complaint
of increasing shortness of breath.  The patient initially
attributed this to an asthma flare.  At this time physical
examination revealed clear lungs and no further work up was
done.

The patient reports progressive shortness of breath and an
inability to sleep or lie down.  She also reports left sided
substernal chest pain without radiation to the neck for four
days.  Her chest pain was rated a 10 out of 10 on the day
prior to admission.  She denies any nausea or vomiting, but
does note some diaphoresis.  The pain is constant.  The
patient reports that she has had this chest pain before.  It
is nonexertional pain.  She has been using inhalers often
without improvement.  She denies any fever or chills, but
does note a productive cough for four days.  The patient also
reports a longstanding left sided upper quadrant pain and
mentions that she has a history of constipation.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to have a blood
pressure of 191/75, a pulse of 64, and oxygen saturation of
100% on nonrebreather face mask.  She had a jugular venous
pressure of 8.0 mm of water and bibasilar crackles.  She had
a chest x-ray suggestive of congestive heart failure and was
started on IV nitroglycerin.  The patient became hypotensive
to the 80s systolic.  She was given small fluid boluses which
raised her pressure to 110 systolic.  The patient refused
BiPAP.  The patient continues to have blood pressure swing in
the 80s-100s with nitroglycerin titrated on and off.  Her
respiratory status improved to 93% on four liters and her
examination improved slightly.  The patient was then admitted
to the Medical [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Critical aortic stenosis.  On [**2106-8-18**], a transthoracic
echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of greater than

first diagonal of 70%, and a proximal circumflex of 80%.  At
this time her left internal mammary artery graft was noted to

upper sternal border, a II/VI coarse systolic murmur at the
apex.  The patient has an S1, S2, and S3 noted.  She has a
prominent PMI.  Pulmonary: decreased breath sounds
bilaterally at the bases with rales to [**1-23**] bilaterally,
diffuse wheezes at the right apex.  Her abdomen is
protuberant, but soft, diffusely tender, and nondistended.
No guarding, no rebound, bowel sounds were present.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an electrocardiogram which
was asensed, V-paced at a rate of 64.  The patient had a PT
of 12.8.  Chem 7: sodium of 129, potassium of 4.9, a chloride
of 94, bicarbonate of 26, BUN of 15, creatinine of 0.9,
glucose of 192.  An INR of 5.0, a PTT of 33.7.

Urinalysis: negative nitrates, protein of 30, no red blood
cells, no white blood cells, no bacteria, less than 1.0
epithelial cell.  She had a hematocrit of 38, white blood
cell count of 12.8, platelets of 394,000.  CKs were 85 and
65, troponin I was less than 0.3.  She had a chest x-ray
which revealed bilateral pleural effusion, positive
cardiomegaly, encephalization consistent with congestive
heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to a
regular hospital bed for management of her congestive heart
failure.  She experienced 10 out of 10 substernal chest pain
on several occasions, that did not result in an elevation of
cardiac enzymes.  She was initially treated with
nitroglycerin which caused her to become hypotensive.  She
then required fluid boluses which worsened her heart failure.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for worsening respiratory distress and management of her
chest pain.

From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient improved
dramatically with careful diuresis.  Given her presumed
preload dependence, our goal was a fluid balance of a
negative [**12-22**] liter which was achieved on a 40-80 mg of IV
Lasix regimen.  By the end of her Coronary Care Unit stay,
she was requiring only two liters of oxygen via nasal cannula
with saturations of 96%.  We aim to maximize her cardiac
regimen and titrate up her Lopressor, reaching a goal dose of
37.5 mg tid.  The patient continued to have episodes of
substernal chest pain on a daily basis.  She was ruled out
for myocardial infarction several times.  Eventually, we
managed her chest pain successfully with a regimen of
morphine and Lasix.  We assumed initially that the aortic
stenosis was the cause of the patient's pain given her valve
area of 0.6 cm2 noted on transthoracic echocardiogram one
month prior.

During her stay the patient had an episode of atrial
fibrillation.  Also notable during her stay, the patient had
an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.  We opted to treat her with proc
