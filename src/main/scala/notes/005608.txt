Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild-moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction of the inferior,
septal and apical walls. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Both leaflets appear

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and the
pt is being AV paced.
1. A mitral annuloplasty ring is well seated. Leaflets move
well. No MR is seen. No [**Male First Name (un) **] is seen. Mean gradient is 4 mm of
Hg.
2. LV function is slightly improved. RV function is unchanged.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and taken directly to the operating room
where Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting along
with a mitral valve repair. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Follow
