by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when

Studies:
[**2165-4-17**] EKG
Probable atrial fibrillation but baseline artifact makes
assessment difficult. Inferolateral myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. ST-T wave abnormalities. Cannot exclude
myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2165-4-17**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)     [**Last Name (LF) 2922**],[**First Name3 (LF) 1730**]
1. Moderate cardiomegaly with bibasilar opacities, which likely
represent
atelectasis.
2. No free intraperitoneal air.

[**2165-4-17**]   Radiology CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO  [**Last Name (LF) 2922**],[**First Name3 (LF) 1730**]
Approved
1. Probable early sigmoid diverticulitis.
2. Fluid-filled small and large bowel loops, possibly reflecting

gastroenteritis.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Renal atrophy.

[**2165-4-18**]   Cardiology ECHO   [**2165-4-18**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Normally-functioning aortic and mitral valve bioprostheses.


[**2165-4-19**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: Moderately severe pulmonary edema is stable. Bilateral
moderately large pleural effusions, moderate cardiomegaly,
median sternotomy wires, and an aortic valve replacement device
are unchanged since [**2165-4-18**].

IMPRESSION: Stable moderately severe pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname 2319**] [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old male with significant cardiac
history s/p CABG AVR/MVR who presented with acute onset
abdominal pain and diarrhea and was found to have a low-normal
blood pressure, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponins.

#. Diarrhea and Abdominal Pain:  Patient had an elevated WBC
count and evidence of diverticulitis on CT scan and was treated
with ciprofloxacin and flagyl with resolution of his symptoms.
He was discharged with prescriptions to complete a 10 day
course.  Surgery was consulted on admission and felt there were
no acute surgical issues.  Stool testing was negative for C.
difficile and other pathogens.

#. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine was elevated to
4.7 on admission (up from reported baseline of 1.5).  This
elevation was likely due to hypotension and volume depletion
from diarrhea with underlying chronic kidney disease.  Al
