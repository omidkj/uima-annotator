Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1032**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH Transfer for AMS and ? seizures


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
86 RHM with PMH of afib currently not on coumadin due to IPH in
[**2142-8-9**], was transfered from OSH.

His neurological problems began in [**2142-8-9**]. Before that, he
was
independent in ADLs and was high functioning. He had acute HA
and
left arm numbness/weakness for which he was taken to [**Hospital1 2025**] where
he
was found to have right temporal bleed. He was managed
conservatively and was dced in late [**Month (only) 205**] to rehab. The Coumadin
was stopped and keppra was added 750 [**Hospital1 **]. The hospital course
was
complicated by MSSA bacteremia with negative TEE, for which he
was treated with abx for 2 weeks with recovery. At rehab he did
make good progress and was sent home on [**9-23**]. From that time,
he is with his son. per son, he did bot have any significant
neurological deficits other than generalised fatigue. He was
doing well till 3 days ago. On friday early am, aroud 3, he came
back from the restroom and as he was coming, he suddenly fell
down. He was yelling for help and was having pain in left ankle.
He sat down and could not get up. 911 was called , he was taken
to OSH where he was evaluated for UTi,PNa which were negative.
CT
head showed no acute bleed. CBC Chem 7 were normal. EKG and card
enzymes didnt show anything acute. He was however noted to be
increasingly confused, drowsy and having repeated jerking
movements of left UE and LE lasting few seconds. Per son, during
few of these movements he was talking and was responding to
voice. The concern was for seizure and small doses of ativan
were
used. He underwent MRI this am which showed 2cm AVM in right ant
temp lobe with minimal edema and enhancement. He was loaded with
dilantin 1 gram IV and trasfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for eval. In the ED,
later, he was noted to have fever 101, was increasingly
tachypneic and was on the verge of intubation. Next, neurology
was called.

While examining him, I saw an episode where he had transient
jerking of left UE and LE lasting few secs also some shaking of
RLE, though much less than Left side.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known firstname **] was admitted as an outside hospital transfer on
dilantin. He was admitted into the ICU on dilantin and was
placed on Keppra as well on [**2142-11-20**]. On [**2142-11-21**] he was tried
off of propfol and was noted to be comatose with shaking of his
left side of his body. He was then  placed on Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
which was originally placed at 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]. On [**2142-11-22**] He was
tried off of propofol again. He was noted to have frequent
shaking of his left side off of propofol within a 2-3 hour
period. Propofol was again restarted and because he was still
comatose without eeg data we clinically believed he was in
status epilepticus and a loading dose of phenobarbital was
given. His post load dose was 25. Afterward we had some analyzed
EEG data that did not show generalized seizures so phenobarbital
was not continued and propofol was taken off. He continued off
of propofol for the next couple of days and kepra was reduced to
1g [**Hospital1 **]. His Dilantin was titrated to a dose of 300mg Twice daily
and this was titrated to an adequate free dilantin level. on
[**2142-11-25**] Mr [**Known firstname **] was still not able to awaken from his
comatose and further imaging and repeat lumbar puncture were
unrevealing.  He respiratory status stablized in the ICU and he
was extubate and remained stable but with poor mental status.
He was transferred to the neurology floor on [**11-30**] and then
began having worsening respiratory distress and breakthrough
seizures.  His family decided to make him comfort measures only
and the palliative care team was consulted.  He was treated with
morphine for comfort and he expired on [**12-1**].
