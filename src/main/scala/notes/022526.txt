.
CTA [**8-3**]:
1.  Increase in ground-glass and interstitial opacities seen in
both lung
fields on a background of chronic fibrosis.  Findings may
represent worsening lymphangitic spread of cancer.  Superimposed
infection and/or pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.

2.  Pneumomediastinum.

3.  No pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 year-old female with NSCLC s/p resection and
chemoradiotherapy, with recent mediastinal nodal recurrence s/p
Taxotere and [**Last Name (LF) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] metastasis s/p Cyberknife surgery,
admitted with a 3-week history of progressive SOB,
pneumomediastinum, and acute respiratory decompensation
overnight.

**Dispo - the patient's family, in light of continued worsening
of clinical status despite broad spectrum antibiotics, very high
dose steroids and 2 equivocal diagnostic bronchoscopies, have
decided to withdraw care this afternoon. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], her
heme/onc has been alerted to this change and is on board with
this decision, as is the ICU team.  The patient was extubated
and expired at 6:25pm on [**2159-8-13**].
.
1) Hypoxemia: The patient likely has AIP as she has been
unresponsive to broad spectrum antibiotics and biopsy negative
for active carcinomatosis. She is requiring higher vent settings
throughout the week and difficulty with oxygenation.
- repeat bronchoscopy unrevealing for etiology of patient's
respiratory failure.
- for AIP will d/c prednisone and start very high dose steroids
with Solumedrol 250mg Q6h, although after 36 hours, does not
seem to be responding.
- Continuing empiric broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin
and Zosyn and have added azithromycin for atypical coverage
- adjust vent to maximize patient comfort.
