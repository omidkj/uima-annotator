Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There are filamentous
strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's
excresences (normal variant). There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is A paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. The
aorta is intact post-decannulation.
