Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, transferred for cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72 year old female with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD who presents from an
outside hospital with increased SOB and new anterolateral ST
elevations, transferred for cardiac catheterization.  She was
admitted to [**Hospital3 2005**] 3-4 weeks ago for an asthma
exacerbation and at that time was started on 2L home O2.  She
has continued to feel SOB since then.  She reports that she has
been on Prednisone for the past 3 months, is currently on 30 mg
daily, and reports that her symptoms worsen when she goes down
to 20 mg daily.  She denies any chest pain, neck/arm pain,
weakness, n/v, diaphoresis, fever/chills, cough, or decrease in
exercise tolerance.  She felt like there was mucus in her chest,
but could not produce any.  Since she was so short of breath,
she went to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital.
.
At the OSH, she was admitted for COPD exacerbation and ROMI.
CXR showed right lung base subsegmental atelecatasis. She was
started on Moxifloxin 400 mg daily, Mucinex 1200 mg [**Hospital1 **],
Albuterol nebs, Symbicort, Spiriva, and Solumedrol 60 IV q6hr.
She had "drainage" with posterior nasal suction to help remove
her secretions, but did not tolerate that well.  During the
hospital course, and EKG showed ST elevation in leads I, aVL,
and V2-V6, and there was concern for a previous anterior septal
wall MI.  CEs: Trop I 0.58->0.29, CK 24->20, CKMB ->5.9.  She
remained chest pain free. Cardiology was consulted (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1270**], and determined that the patient was having an
acute anterior wall MI.  She was started on ASA 325->81 daily,
Plavix 75 daily, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Her HR was 110 prior
to transfer, treated with Lopressor 5 mg IV x2 with improvement
to the 80s-90s.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], vitals pre-cath showed bp 104/52, HR 86, RR 32, SaO2
89% on 2L.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild non-obstructive
CAD (LAD with 30% proximal stenosis, LCx 40% after OM1)and
possible Takotsubos. After the procedure her SBP ranged 88-90s
with occasional decrease to 78.  She was given a total of 1 L NS
divided into boluses.  A bedside echo was completed.
.
She currently is chest pain free, and her SOB has improved. She
is fatigued.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
syncope or presyncope.  She has occasional dyspnea on exertion
and palpitations.

Past Medical History:
Cardiac Risk Factors:

(+) Hypertension (baseline bp 140/70)
.
Cardiac History: CABG, PCI, Pacemaker/ICD - None.
.
Other Past History:
1. COPD/Asthmatic bronchitis, Asthma developed 10 yrs ago after
she stopped smoking, has been on 2 L O2 on a prn basis for the
past 3 weeks, has been on prednisone maintenance for the last 3
months and is currently on 30 mg/day.  Pulmonologist is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7493**] at [**Hospital3 **].  Has had 3 hospitalizations for
asthma, never been intubated.
2. Previous tobacco use

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use.  She previously smoked 1 [**11-19**] ppd for 35 years, quit 10 yrs
ago. There is no history of alcohol abuse.  She is a retired
nurse.  She lives in an apartment within her relative's house.
At baseline she is independent in her ADLs and IADLs, and is
very active.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.  Her mother and sister have [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease
and her father died of multiple myeloma.

Brief Hospital Course:
72F h/o COPD, HTN, s/p acute MI [**12-20**] coronary vasospasm (no
Takotsubo given no ballooning on cath), s/p cath with fluid
resuscitation, transferred to MICU in acute hypoxic respiratory
distress, found to have pneumonia and LLL collapse.

1) Hypoxic respiratory distress [**12-20**] COPD, collapsed LL: COPD
with end-stage lung disease, collapsed LL, and initially CHF,
with also PNA. S/p bronchoscopy [**12-6**] with extensive suctioning
for mucous plug and LLL collapse, stable on supplemental O2.
Improved on zosyn therapy and s/p bronch. Volume overload: BNP
initially elevated s/p cath, the pt autodiuresing for a goal
even I/Os.  For her COPD she was placed on a steroid taper to
15mg daily.  Plan to taper every two weeks as outlined in the
discharge orders.  For her pneumonia she received a one week
course of vanc and zosyn. She continues to have an oxygen
requirement and benefits from pulmonary rehab. While on
prednisone she will receive PCP prophylaxis Bactrim DS 1 tab
MWF.  On the day of discharge she was saturating 98% on 2L NC.
She will benefit from pulmonary rehab and will need to see a
pulmonologist as an outpatient.  She was scheduled with follow
up prior to discharge.

2)Labile BPs: Fluctuated between hypo and hypertension, with
historical baselines of SBP 140s. Initial concern for
cardiogenic origin of patient's respiratory distress. Bedside
ECHO in the setting of acute hypotension post cath did not
indicate RV strain. Likely poor forward flow due to diastolic
failure. BPs becoming more normotensive at the end of her
hospitalization.  She was started on Metoprolo 12.5mg TID which
was then increased to QID, titrated to blood pressure and HR.

3) Acute MI [**12-20**] coronary vasospams: Cath showed only mild non
obstructive disease, but hypokinesis evident on echo, indicating
likely coronary vasospasm, although not Takotsubo as no
ballooning on echo. She remained on aspirin and statin and
metoprolol at discharge.

4) Supraventricular Tachycardia: ?AVNRT v ?MAT, controlled with
metoprolol although she continues to have occasional bursts of
non sustained SVT.

5)thrombocytopenia - most likely [**12-20**] acute illness, time course
not c/w HIT however will d/c heparin sq and start pneumoboots in
case.

6)Chronic diastolic heart failure: currently euvolemic.  She was
discharged on metoprolol q6 hours.  Her outpatient medications
including lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil were
held during her admission as metoprolol was titrated up for rate
control.  Lisinopril should be restarted once blood pressure
will tolerate.  She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
