Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
male patient with a history of hypertension and
gastroesophageal reflux disease who presented with a 2-day
history of back pain.

The patient was in his usual state of good health until two
days prior to admission when he developed interscapular back
pain which a nonradiating.  This back pain worsened over the
day prior to admission and was associated with diaphoresis.
The patient denied any shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
or chest pain.  He described his back pain as a [**6-7**]
dull/aching pain in the center of his back which increased to
a [**10-7**].

The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] where he was noted
to have electrocardiogram changes.  He was started on
aspirin, heparin, and metoprolol and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.

On admission to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was taken emergently to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory.  At that time he denied any chest pain, dyspnea
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
shortness of breath, edema, palpitations, syncope, or
presyncope.  The patient's back pain had resolved.

2. Atenolol 50 mg by mouth once per day.
3. Prevacid 30 mg by mouth once per day.
4. Triamterine 37 mg by mouth once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is currently retired but
previously worked repairing bridges.  The patient is married
and has two sons.  [**Name (NI) **] denies a history of tobacco use.  He
reports on occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
afebrile, his blood pressure was 159/79, his heart rate was
68, his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation
was 96 percent on room air.  In general,  a well-appearing
elderly male lying in bed after his cardiac catheterization
in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were intact.
The patient had dry mucous membranes.  The oropharynx was
clear.  Neck revealed no jugular venous distention and no
thyromegaly.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  Normal first and second heart sounds.
There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen
revealed there were normal active bowel sounds.  Soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities revealed 2 plus
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
There was no evidence of lower extremity edema.  The patient
had a sheath in place in his right groin.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 11.3, his hematocrit was 49.1, and his
platelets were 316.  His INR was 0.94.  sodium was 136,
potassium was 3.3, chloride was 94, bicarbonate was 32, blood
urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1.2, and his blood
glucose was 226.  His troponin was 0.05.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram initially
revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 66 beats per minute with a
left bundle branch block.  Subsequent electrocardiogram
showed a normal sinus rhythm at 51 beats per minute with a
left bundle branch block as well as 9-mm ST elevations in V2
through V3 and 5-mm ST elevations in V1 and V4.

Cardiac catheterization - on [**2170-6-14**] - revealed there
was a 100 percent mid left anterior descending lesion after
the second diagonal; status post three stents (two Taxus/one
Pixel), dilated distal third diagonal with residual 60
percent stenosis.  Circumflex noted to come from the right
coronary artery.  Hemodynamics were significant for a right
atrial pressure of 9, right ventricular pressure of 40/4,
pulmonary artery pressure of 40/18, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 18, cardiac output of 2.85, and a cardiac index
of 1.57.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  As noted previously, the
   patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 10154**] for as an outpatient for a diagnostic and
   therapeutic cardiac catheterization.

The patient cardiac catheterization revealed a 100 percent
mid left anterior descending lesion that was stented with
three stents.  The patient was continued on aspirin and
Plavix in addition to Integrilin for 18 hours.  The patient
was also started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor; the
doses of which were titrated up as tolerated by his blood
pressure and heart rate.

The patient was evaluated with an echocardiogram on the day
following admission which revealed an ejection fraction of 30
percent and apical akinesis.  The patient was subsequently
started on heparin and Coumadin.  It is anticipated that the
patient will be evaluated by Electrophysiology in one month
after discharge given these findings.

1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  As noted previously, the
   patient had an echocardiogram on hospital day two that
   revealed an ejection fraction of 30 percent with extensive
   apical akinesis.  The patient was started on Coumadin with
   his INR followed.  The patient was bridged with a heparin
   drip.

1. RHYTHM ISSUES:  On the day prior to discharge, the patient
   was noted on telemetry to be tachycardic.  An evaluation
   of the rhythm strip demonstrated atrial fibrillation
   alternating with atrial flutter.  The patient self-
   converted back into a normal sinus rhythm.  His beta
   blocker dose was increased for better rate control, and
   his Coumadin was continued for his extensive apical
   akinesis as well as the demonstration of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation.  It is anticipated that the patient will be
   evaluated by Electrophysiology in one month after
   discharge for risk stratification.

1. DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient has no history of
   diabetes mellitus but was noted to have somewhat elevated
   blood sugars throughout his hospitalization.  It is
   anticipated that this will be followed by the patient's
   primary care physician once he is discharged, and is on
   his regular diet and performing his regular activities.

1. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was
   continued on a proton pump inhibitor for his history of
   gastroesophageal reflux disease and had no complaints
   throughout his hospitalization.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease; status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stenting of
the 100 percent mid left anterior descending lesion.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.

Ejection fraction of 30 percent with apical akinesis.

Hypertension.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
2. Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
3. Toprol-XL 200 mg by mouth once per day.
4. Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth once per day.
5. Atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
6. Coumadin 5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
7. Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP:  The patient was encouraged
to follow up with his primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19961**] - within several days after his discharge.  The
patient was to have his blood drawn on the day after
discharge - on [**2170-6-18**] - to check his INR. These
results will be given or faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55684**] office, and he
will adjust his Coumadin dose as necessary.  The patient was
encouraged to discuss his elevated blood sugars with his
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] we recommend that his fasting
blood sugar checked once he is discharged.

The patient was also encouraged to follow up with his
cardiologist - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1637**] - within one week after di
