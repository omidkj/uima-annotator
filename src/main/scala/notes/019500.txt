Pertinent Results:
[**2181-5-8**]: TTE
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the
right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LVEF=
60 %. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The NCC is immobile and heavily calcified. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation.
POST-CPB: On infusion of Nitroglycerine. AV pacing. Well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. No AI. Gradient is
now peak 15 mmHg. [**Location (un) 109**] = 1.5 cm2. Normal biventricular systolic
function. Mild MR, TR as before. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 88 year old female with know aortic stenosis and
peripheral vascular disease who initially presented with chest
pain.  She underwent cardiac catherization and was found to have
2 vessel coronary artery disease.  She had a preoperative workup
with included a hepatology consult for elevated transaminase.
Preoperative chest CT revealed multiple less than 3 mm lung
nodules for which follow up in one year is recommended.

She was brought to the Operating Room on [**5-8**] for aortic valve
replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 6158**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor tissue valve
and a coronary artery bypass surgery x2 with left internal
mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.  See
operative note for full details.

She weaned from bypass on Neo Synephrine and Propofol infusions.
She was weaned from all vasoactive medications and extubated on
post operative day 1 without incident.  The EP service
interrogated her permanent pacemaker on the night of surgery and
parameters were good.  She went into atrial fibrillation on
postoperative day 2 and was started on Amiodarone with
conversion to sinus rhythm.  Her oral doses were decreased after
she was complaining of nausea.  Beta blockers were begun as was
diuresis.

She was transferred to the step down unit in stable condition on
post operative day 3.  Her Foley needed to be reinserted due to
urinary retention and was subsequently removed on postoperative
day 4 and passed her voiding trial.  She has poor intake and was
started on nutritional supplements.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  She continued
to work with Physical Therapy to increase strength and
endurance.  She developed recurrent atrial fibrillation on POD 5
with a ventricular rate of 100-120. Hydralazine was discontinued
and Lopressor increased.

She converted to sinus rhythm and remained there for 24 hours.
Coumadin was not begun. She was ready for discharge on [**5-15**] and
was discharged to [**Hospital3 **]. Arrangments were made for
outpatient followup.  Medications are as listed elsewhere.
