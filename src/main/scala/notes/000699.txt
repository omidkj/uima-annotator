Brief Hospital Course:
68yo M squamous cell throat cancer w recent hx of pneumonia and
ICU stay, s/p Trach/PEG, presented w tracheostomy tube in false
lumen.

#) Tracheostomy Replacement: on presentation patient initially
had bleeding around his trach site, and his ET tube was found to
be full of clots, in the ED, his tracheotomy tube replaced.
While changing the tube, a false passage was noted. This passage
was not present at discharge.  On HD 2, the tracheotomy tube
migrated into the false passage and required a second procedure
to secure the airway. Which was complicated by a left
pneumothorax seen on follow-up chest xray, and a chest tube was
placed by the SICU team.  The chest tube was removed [**10-17**] with
small residual apical pneumothorax, patient will need repeat
chest x-ray in [**2-3**] days after discharge to make sure the
pneumothorax has not worsened.

#) Leukocytosis: patient with persistent leukocytosis with white
blood cell counts over 20, and he continued to have low grade
temps.  He was recultured, C.diff was sent, and his repeat
sputum culture also showed MRSA, which was thought to be
colonization rather then infection.  His chest x-ray on the day
of discharge showed improvement in LLL.

#) Nutrition: Continuous tube feeds were transitioned to bolus
tube feeds and the patient appeared to tolerate well with low
residuals.

#) Hypertension: overall his BP was well controlled but he was
hypertensive in the morning, so he may need his medications
split to morning and evening meds.

*Do not change trach tube until [**2184-11-12**]. This time is required

Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**],
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having
difficulty breathing. The Otolaryngology Surgeons and
Interventional Pulmonology doctors helped replace your
tracheostomy tube so that you should be able to breathe better.
Your tracheostomy tube was replaced with a longer tube to help
prevent this from happening again in the future.  During the
replacement of your tracheostomy, the procedure was complicated
by a pneumothorax (left lung collapse) and you had a chest tube
placed.  After the lung reinflated you were abl
