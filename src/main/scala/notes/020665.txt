Date of Birth:   [**2119-3-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
female who has a history of atrial fibrillation and is status
post mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve
secondary to rheumatic heart disease and is on Coumadin.  She
does have a history of multiple strokes including an old
frontal infarct and an old watershed infarct on the left side
with hemorrhage.  She was admitted in [**2174-12-25**] with a
few days of severe headache but no aneurysm was found by
angiogram and she did have a history of a third nerve palsy.
Over the last six months, she has become increasingly
depressed and unable to participate in her physical therapy
and occupational therapy and was also noted to be
incontinent.  She does have minimal ability to do activities
of daily living.  She is unconcerned and speaks very little
at a time.  She was started on Zoloft and Ritalin without
good effect.

A head CT done on [**2175-7-21**] showed an increase in size of
her ventricles.  She is now admitted to the Neurology Service
for evaluation of possible hydrocephalus.

3.  Lisinopril.
4.  Methylphenidate.
5.  Coreg.
6.  Zoloft.
7.  Tums.
8.  Coumadin as needed to maintain an INR greater than 2.5.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 3146**].  She
is Italian and immigrated to the United States over 30 years
ago and formerly worked as a medical assistant.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.4, heart rate 60, blood pressure 110/64, respirations 20,
02 saturation of 95% on room air.  General:  The patient was
a middle-aged woman sitting in a wheelchair in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  PEERL, EOMI, and anicteric sclerae.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
Irregularly/irregular.  She has a soft grade II systolic
murmur at the base.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended
with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and because her
INR was greater than 1.5 she remained in the hospital for
three days before her INR was less than 1.5 and a lumbar
puncture was able to be performed.  Following her lumbar
puncture, she did have slight improvement in her symptoms,
specifically that her speech was greater quantity and she
seems to be quicker in her movements.  She is also more
descriptive in her speech.  It was felt that with this
improvement she may need to have a VP shunt placed and
Neurosurgery was consulted.

The Neurosurgical Team saw her and felt that a VP shunt would
likely be helpful; however, they did feel that she would be
at risk of significant problems given her need for
anticoagulation in lieu of her mechanical valve.  The
decision was then made to proceed with the VP shunt.  On
[**2175-8-12**], a right VP shunt was placed.  The patient tolerated
the procedure and was transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] II after
normal recovery in the PACU.

The patient continued to recover normally from her VP shunt
placement until the morning of [**2175-8-14**] when she
experienced worsening shortness of breath with a rapid heart
rate.  A Cardiology consult was called and they felt that if
the chest x-ray was consistent with CHF she should be
diuresed with Lasix and possibly she could be started on IV
Diltiazem if her heart rate did not slow.  At the time, her
heart rate was in the 120s, irregular.  It was also suggested
that she be restarted on her heparin and Coumadin not only
for her mechanical valve but also for the atrial
fibrillation.

In light of her respiratory status and rapid rate, she was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because of her
atrial fibrillation and rate increase to 140 with a blood
pressure drop to 80/palpable with a saturation of 90% on 100%
nonrebreather.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed
which showed a left thrombus in the left atrium and no valve
motion.  The patient was then transferred to the PACU where
she was intubated and a central line and arterial line were
placed.

She was then brought to the Operating Room for an urgent
procedure including a left atrial thrombectomy and a redo
sternotomy with a redo mitral valve replacement with a #25
Carbomedics mechanical valve.  She was transferred to the
CRSU on dobutamine, milrinone, Levophed, Neo-Synephrine.  She
was intubated, sedated, and had an intra-aortic balloon pump.

Throughout the operative night, she was weaned off her
propofol drip and remained calm and followed commands
appropriately.  She did stay in a tachy-atrial fibrillation
with frequent ventricular ectopy in the overnight period.
Her balloon pump remained in place and she maintained a
cardiac index on milrinone of greater than 2.8 with a mixed
venous gas of 74% or greater.

Later on postoperative day number one, she was weaned from
her dobutamine and continued on the milrinone.  She was noted
to have a decreasing platelet count and HIT antibody screen
was sent off.  She was kept intubated during the stay partly
for small amounts of thick yellow secretions.  She also was
started on an Amiodarone drip to help with her ventricular
ectopy and atrial fibrillation.

On her second postoperative day, she did remain intubated and
more of her drips were weaned off.  By postoperative day
number three, she was extubated and her intra-aortic balloon
pump was discontinued without incident.  It was noted that
her platelet count did continue to decrease and another HIT
screen was sent and she was found to have HIT antibody
positive.  Therefore, her heparin drip was discontinued and
she was started on Argatroban as per the Hematology Service.

On the following day, [**2175-8-19**], her INR was elevated to
4.7 and this was thought to be secondary to the Argatroban
and this drip was held.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was
performed and she was noted to have a functioning valve with
decreased biventricular dysfunction which was unchanged from
preoperatively.

On the evening of [**2175-8-20**], she was noted to have a
decrease in her level of consciousness and was noted to be
disoriented.  She was sent for a CT scan of her head and was
found to have a small right frontal subdural hematoma.  At
the same time, LFTs were sent and these were noted to be
elevated.  At this point, her Argatroban was discontinued
completely and for anticoagulation, she was started on
.................... per Hematology Service.

On the following day, [**2175-8-21**], she received a GI
consult for her elevated LFTs.  It was felt that this could
possibly be due to coincidence with the Argatroban but as
many of the medications that are cleared hepatically that
were stopped were.  Also, at this point, she had a
self-limited run of V-fib and an EP consult was called for an
AICD placement secondary to a run of V-fib in lieu of her low
ejection fraction.

On [**2175-8-22**], she received a repeat head CT to evaluate
her subdural hematoma which showed no changes.  At this
point, she remained stable and she remained in the CRSU while
awaiting AICD placement.  The delay in this placement was
secondary to elevated INR for which on [**2175-8-27**], she
received 1 mg of vitamin K.  By [**2175-8-28**], her INR was
less than 1.5 and she was able to go to the Electrophysiology
Laboratory for AICD placement.

She did receive a dose of Coumadin the night of [**2175-8-28**] and was started back on her .................... drip on
the morning of [**2175-8-29**].  Also, it was felt that her
Amiodarone would not be needed anymore and this was
discontinued.  Following her AICD placement, she was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] II and started on Ancef for 48 hours and
then Keflex for 72 hours.

Following this, she was encouraged to in
