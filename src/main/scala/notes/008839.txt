Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old
Caucasian male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1,
chronic renal insufficiency, status post transplant in [**2130**],
recurrent pneumoniae and coronary artery disease who has been
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) on
[**2141-12-13**] with hypoxic respiratory failure and
subsequently transferred to the floor.

The patient was in his usual state of health until the
morning of [**2141-12-13**], when he had an acute episode of
hypoglycemia with a blood sugar of 27.  The patient reports
taking his normal dose of insulin the night before and eating
his bedtime snack and, in the middle of the morning, was
shaking and unresponsive.  His wife called emergency medical
services, who came and treated the patient with juice and
possibly an ampule of D50 and the patient subsequently
aroused.  He had some dyspnea and some abdominal discomfort
and he and his wife came to the Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to have a
temperature of 102 and decreased oxygen saturation to 80%.  A
chest x-ray done was consistent with right middle lobe and
right lower lobe pneumonia and the patient was intubated for
hypoxic respiratory failure and transferred to the MICU.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was admitted to
the MICU intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.  He was
started on levofloxacin for a [**Hospital1 **]-lobar pneumonia noted on
chest x-ray.  The patient remained intubated for two days in
the MICU and was eventually weaned and extubated without
problems.  Throughout the remainder of his hospital course on
the floor, the patient was completely stable from a
respiratory standpoint.  His oxygen was eventually weaned and
a repeat chest x-ray prior to discharge showed dramatic
improvement in his [**Hospital1 **]-lobar pneumonia.  He will complete a
full 14 day course of levofloxacin.  Flagyl was added several
days after levofloxacin for a concern of aspiration during
his hypoglycemic coma and during resuscitation by the
emergency medical technicians with juice.

2.  Endocrine:  The patient was admitted to the MICU after a
hypoglycemic coma and was started on fluids with Dextrose.
He subsequently had high fingerstick glucoses and was started
on an insulin drip in the unit.  On transfer to the floor, he
was switched back over to subcutaneous insulin, with poorly
controlled blood sugars in the 400s.  His total daily dose of
insulin was calculated, his sensitivity ratio was calculated
and his insulin to carbohydrate ratio was calculated, and the
patient was started on a new regimen with glargine 20 units
in the evening and a new insulin sliding scale, with
subsequent excellent control of his blood sugars.  Once the
patient was on nothing by mouth for various catheter
placements, his blood sugars were again poorly controlled and
the endocrinology/diabetes consult service was contact[**Name (NI) **].
They changed his regimen and his blood sugars were noted to
be under improved control.  The patient was kept on his
operating table dose of Levoxyl for hypothyroidism.

3.  Renal:  The patient was admitted with a history of
chronic renal insufficiency, status post a kidney transplant
in [**2130**], and was thought to have chronic rejection, though
previous biopsies show no evidence of rejection.  The renal
team followed the patient throughout his entire
hospitalization.  Once the patient was transferred to the
floor, he received a hemodialysis catheter and received
hemodialysis three days.  He was maintained on sodium
bicarbonate and calcium acetate as well as Nephrocaps
throughout his hospital course.  The patient was supposed to
get a peritoneal dialysis catheter placed on
