shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
This 78 year-old female with critical aortic stenosis([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7,
peak gradient 42mm)and 3 vessel coronary disease is awaiting
surgucal intervention.She was  discharged [**2154-5-9**] to rehab with
a wound vac on her right transmetatarsal site and vancomycin PO
for C. difficile.  At rehab her  initial weight was 203lbs. On
[**5-13**] she was noted to be orthostatic, was given a fluid bolus
and lasix was stopped. At that time her creatinine was also
noted to be rising (1.8 to 2.2). She has been of of Lasix since
that time. Given her poor oral intake and  diarrhea she was
started on maintenance fluids on [**5-20**]. The morning of admission
she was found to be hypotensive (SBP 60s; baseline 90-110s) with
bibasilar crackles. She was given 1250cc fluid over 3 hours. As
BP was not fluid responsive she was started on dopamine and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she reported wheezing for 1-2 days and
denied nocyurnal dyspnea.  She admitted to orthopnea, reports a
nonproductive cough, denies fever, chills.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2154-3-4**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Moderate-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. No LV
mass/thrombus. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting
LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild (1+) MR. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views. Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
