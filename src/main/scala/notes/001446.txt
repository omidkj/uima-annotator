a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ITP,
who presented to the Emergency Department after a few hour
history of chest and abdominal discomfort, increasing
shortness of breath, and nausea with an episode of vomiting

the left arm, severity [**4-20**] and associated epigastric
discomfort with nausea and vomiting x1 in the Emergency
Department.  He reports recent sweats and chills, but did not
take his temperature.  He reports intermittent chest
discomfort of short duration over the past few days in
addition to a long history of chronic nausea.

found to have an elevated white blood cell count with
bandemia.  The patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl,
and given 3 liters of normal saline for rehydration to bring
his systolic blood pressure to the mid 90s.  Patient was

persistent shortness of breath in addition to IV Solu-Medrol
125 mg IV x1 for suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  An 89-year-old male with a history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ITP, who presented
with fever, elevated white count, and evidence of pneumonia
on chest x-ray with suspected sepsis and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Sepsis:  Patient's blood pressure responded well to IV
fluid hydration and at no time did the patient require
pressure control using intravenous pressors.  He was
initially started on a course of Levaquin, Flagyl, and
ceftriaxone, but was switched to a 14 day course of Levaquin
for treatment of community acquired pneumonia.  His white
blood cell count did drop to 11.8 in the setting of continued
use of steroids.  He remained afebrile during his admission
with the only episode of fever occurring in the Emergency
Room with a temperature of 101.7.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation:  The
patient was started on a course of Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV q6h
for three days, and then was placed on a prednisone taper for
control of ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.  The patient remained intermittently
rhonchorous, did respond to continued albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizer treatments ranging from q4 to q6h, and was also
continued on a salmeterol inhaler [**Hospital1 **].

3. Myocardial infarction:  The patient did rule in for a
myocardial infarction by the third set of enzymes for 24
hours after admission.  Peaked CKs reached 421, troponin peak
was at 0.19.  Cardiology consult was obtained.  The etiology
was attributed to demand ischemia in the setting of the
patient having tachycardia with his pneumonia and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient was
started on aspirin, Lipitor, and beta blocker regimen to
control his heart rate.

Echocardiogram was done and the results are the following:
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with
an ejection fraction of 40-50% secondary to hypokinesis of
the mid apical segments of the inferior and posterior walls,
right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.  There is mild 1+ aortic regurgitation.  There is no
aortic valve stenosis.  There is no mitral regurgitation and
no evidence of pericardial effusion.  The patient did
experience an episode of [**9-20**] chest pain during the second
day of his hospital stay.  Electrocardiogram changes were
noted including depressions in V2 and V3, pain and
electrocardiogram changes did respond to nitroglycerin
treatments, which are also continued on a prn basis.  A
stress test was recommended for assessment of his cardiac
function once his active medical issues were resolved.

4. Gastrointestinal:  Patient's epigastric discomfort was
attributed to an anginal equivalent as his liver function
tests were within normal limits.  The patient was continued
on Mylanta and Prilosec for control of his chronic heartburn
and nausea issues.  Also, the patient was given Zofran prn
for control of ongoing nausea.

5. Renal:  The patient presented with an increase in his
creatinine to 1.5 which is slightly above his baseline of
1.0.  This acute renal failure was suspected to be attributed
to dehydrated state.  His FENA was consistent with a prerenal
state, and his creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] limits with IV
fluid hydration.

6. Hematology:  The patient has a history of iron deficiency
anemia and thrombocy
