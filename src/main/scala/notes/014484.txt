History of Present Illness:
This is a 49-year-old female who has a history of known CAD s/p
PCI of the RCA and the LCx in [**2135-12-13**]. She reports that

describes these symptoms, as chest pains that radiate to her
throat and jaw and are associated with shortness of breath. She

restenosis. She was thus referred for surgical intervention.

Chest: CTAB -w/r/r
Heart: RRR -c/r/m/g
Abd: Soft, NT/ND +BS
Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema
Neuro: MAE, Non-focal, A&O x 3

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**7-30**]: Prebypass: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include mildly depressed mid and apical portions of the inferior
wall. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The right coronary stent is seen
protruding into the aorta about 1 cm above the aortic valve. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Chordal [**Male First Name (un) **] seen. Post
Bypass: Biventricular systolic function remains unchanged. Mild
mitral regurgitation persists.
CXR [**8-4**]: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate
interval removal of the right internal jugular introducer seen
on [**2136-8-2**]. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours
are unchanged. Patient is again noted to be status post median
sternotomy. No effusion. There may be mild left basilar
atelectasis, improved when compared to the previous exam. Mild
right basilar atelectasis persists. Trachea is midline.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mention in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac cath on
[**7-24**] where she was found to have severe three vessel disease.
She was discharged home after cath and returned to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-30**]
for same day admit. On this day she was brought to the operating
room where she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass graft x 4.
Please see operative report for surgical details. She tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. While in the CSRU she continued
to have ongoing bleeding in her chest tubes (approx. 200 cc/hr)
despite platelets, pRBC and aprotinin. She was later brought
back to the operating room for exploration. After re-op she was
again transferred back to the CSRU. She remained intubated until
post-op day one where she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta blockers and diuretics
were started and she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op
weight. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed on
post-op day three. She was transferred to the telemetry floor on
post-op day four. She continued to make steady improvements and
appeared to be doing well with stable labs and vitals signs on
post-op day six. She was thus discharged home with VNA services
and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
