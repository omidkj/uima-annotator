History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] is a 50M with a PMH of polysubstance abuse, Hepatitis
C, and depression who was found down by his family with altered
mental status on the evening of [**7-29**].  Per the patient's family,
he had been on a week-long binge with multile substances, those
of which are known to the family include: ETOH, benzodiazapines,
heroin, trazodone, and crack.  He was discovered asleep in his
car outside of his family's house on the evening of [**7-29**].  The
next morning, he was not fully arousable.  He was taken to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital on the morning of [**7-30**] for altered mental status.
The work-up at [**Hospital3 **] included:
1. Liver failure
2. Acute renal failure
3. Elevated cardiac enzymes
4. Left arm skin breakdown with compartment syndrome.
5. MRI of the head showing multiple embolic CVA's
6. Rhabdomyolysis
He was transferrd to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In our ED, he presented with the following vital signs: 190/95,
104, 97%RA.  Clinically he was somnolent, following simple
commands, hypertensive, and tachycardic.  He was given valium
for presumed alcohol withdrawl, and was then intubated for
airway protection.  Serum/urine tox confirmed the presence of
benzodiazapines and cocaine.  He was found to be in fulminant
liver failure with a transaminitis and coagulopathy.  It was
unclear if this was due to tylenol toxicity vs. shock picture,
so the ED administered N-acetyl cysteine with the toxicology
service consulting, despite negative tylenol on his tox screen.
He received a 150mg/kg bolus over 60 minutes  Neurology was
consulted for the acute mental status changes with embolic
strokes- they had no further recommendations, as anticoagulating
him would not be possible given his coagulopathy.  Orthopedics
was consulted for his left arm compartment syndrome, and plan
for a faciotomy.  His rhabdomyolysis was managed with saline
diuresis, with approximately 6-7L of NS.  He was also found to
be in acute renal failure, with a Cr of 3.7.  His CK-MB and
troponin were elevated, cardiology was notified of the admision,
but had no current recommendations.  Labs were otherwise notable
for a positive UA, a normal lactate level, hyponatremia,
hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia.  Our ED ordered a CT torso and
cervical spine.

      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.  PENICILLIN SENSITIVITY AVAILABLE ON
