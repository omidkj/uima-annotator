Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Scrotal swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Foley catheter repositioning in the OR
PICC line placement
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 20 year-old paraplegic male with a chronic indwelling
foley who was transfered from an outside hospital for new
scrotal swelling and fevers.  A CT scan demonstrated that the
balloon was inflated in the prostatic urethra with extravasation
of fluid in the soft tissue.  He was intubated in the emergenyc
department for respiratory distress.  He was taken to the OR for
repositioning of the foley catheter.  He was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics for presumed urosepsis.

Past Medical History:
1. Paraplegia status post being a pedestrian struck by a drunk
driver.  He sustained a C1 fracure.  Also, had a splenectomy.
2. History of DVT and PE and is on coumadin.
3. History of MRSA bacteremia
4. History of Pseudomonal, klebsiella, and MRSA pneumonia
5. History of illicit drud use.

Social History:
He lives with his father.  [**Name (NI) **] has been smoking for the past 4
years.  He also smokes crystal meth.  He denies alcohol or other
drug use.

Family History:
Noncontributory.

Imaging:
1. Chest x-ray: Right lower lobe atelectasis verse pneumonia.
Right main stem intubation.
2. CT torso: Large amount of low attenuation fluid and stranding
in the scrotum and associated inflammatory stranding of the
suprapubic soft tissues. A Foley catheter balloon is seen
expanded within the mid penile urethra, and lack of
visualization of the right lateral wall of the urethra at this
level may represent disruption. These findings likely represent
urethral trauma with extravasation of urine to the scrotum.
Alternatively, the fluid and stranding could be related to an
infectious process.  Left gluteal ulcer extending to the ischial
tuberosity without associated fluid collection. Developing sinus
tract in the right posterior subcutaneous tissues at the L3
level.  No PE.  Right lower lobe collapse and left lower lobe
subsegmental atelectasis.  Fatty liver.
.
[**2179-3-11**]: Repeat CT Scan: Again seen are opacities in the right
lower lobe consistent with aspiration, slightly improved
compared to prior study. There is also evidence of linear
atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Small pericardial effusion
is noted.

There again appears to be fatty infiltration of the liver. No
focal masses are identified within the liver. The gallbladder,
pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Multiple small
dense foci are seen within the right kidney, possibly
representing tiny stones or vascular calcifications. No evidence
of hydronephrosis. The patient is status post splenectomy. The
large and small bowel appear within normal limits. No
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy is identified. There is no evidence of free
fluid or free air within the abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid
colon appear unremarkable. Air is seen within the bladder,
likely secondary to repositioned Foley catheterization. Again
seen is marked suprapubic cutaneous stranding. Peri- penile,
urethral, and scrotal stranding appears slightly improved from
prior study. Again seen are large inguinal lymph nodes
bilaterally. No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymphadenopathy
is identified. There is no evidence of free fluid within the
pelvis. Again seen is evidence of a sinus tract in the right
posterior subcutaneous tissue. The scrotum is not completely
imaged on today's study.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified. Again seen is right transverse process fracture of
L1.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease in peri- penile, urethral, and scrotal
stranding.
2. Suprapubic cutaneous stranding, relatively unchanged from
prior study.
3. Air is seen within the bladder, likely secondary to
repositioned foley catheter within the bladder.
4. Partial clearing of right lower lobe opacities consistent
with aspiration.
5. Unchanged appearing sinus tract in right posterior
subcutaneous tissue.
6. Fatty liver.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 20 year-old paraplegic admitted for presumed urosepsis
secondary to malpositioned foley catheter.
.
1. Scrotal swelling: He presented with marked scrotal swelling
and was found to have the balloon of his foley inflated within
the prostatic urethra with extravasation of fluid into the
surrounding tissues.  The urology team took him to the OR for
repositioning of the foley.  His scrotum was cellulitic without
evidence of an abscess.  He was initially maintained on borad
spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and zosyn.
Urine cultures from the outside hospital grew out greater than
100,000 each of providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas, serratia
marcescens, enteroccoccus faecalis.  Based on antibiotice
sensitivities, his antibiotic coveraged was changed to zosyn and
levofloxacin.  A repeat CT scan demonstrated decreased
stranding.  With treatment, his urine bacterial cultures
cleared, but then grew out yeast.  His catheter has been changed
again.

He continued to spike fevers and had a persistent leukocytosis
and eosinophilia while on zosyn and levo.  We suspected possible
drug allergy to zosyn, and his antibiotic regimen was changed to
his current regimen of levofloxacin, metronidazole,and
vancomycin with resolution of fever and improved WBC count. He
did have a significant reactive thrombocytosis which has
stabilized.  He was followed very closely by the infectious
disease team throughout his hospitalization, as well as wound
care and urology.  His scrotal edema is improving, though he
still has areas of necrotic tissue with active drainage of
yellow pus, in particular the inferior portion of his scrotum.


He is to continue on antibiotics for an additional 4 weeks (from
start date of his current regimen [**3-13**]) and follow-up with ID
and urology in 3 weeks.  The team gave him and his family
explicit instructions to return for medical attention sooner if
he develops any worsening edema, pain, discharge, fever, chills.
 Additionally, we have emphasized the importance of staying away
from illicit drugs.  We spent extensive time speaking to both
his mother and father regarding his discharge
instructions, as Mr. [**Known lastname 45670**] has seemed emotionally unable at
times to act in his own best interests (threatening to leave AMA
on multiple occasions despite his life-threatening infections,
including immediately post-extubation; crying when
we advised that he
