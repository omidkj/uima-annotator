Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Lower extremity swelling
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Dyspnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3646**] is a 52 year-old gentleman with history of
hypertension, HLD, presenting with bilateral peripheral edema
for three days.  Patient was walking more over the weekend and
noted b/l lower extremity edema and erythema. He attributed the
worsened peripheral edema to increased ambulation.  Today he had
two teeth extracted.  He was concerned about the edema and came
to the emergency department.  Patient denies fever and chills.
No chest pain or shortness of breath. Pt endorses cough
productive of white sputum. No recent immobilization, long
car/plane rides.

Of note, he was hospitalized from [**6-5**] - [**6-7**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] for
pneumonia. He was sent home with a 8 day course of levofloxacin
(although he ended up getting 16 days filled at pharmacy and is
still taking it).  He has felt better since being discharged
from hospital and had not had ongoing fevers or chills.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.8 102 142/61 16 98%. Exam was
notable for b/l lower extremity edema and erythema.  Patient had
b/l lower extremity ultrasound that showed no DVT.  CXR showed
right sided lung consolidation.  Patient received vancomycin and
< 1 L NS.  Admission was planned for medicine floor for
cellulitis, when patient developed acute onset respiratory
distress and oxygen desaturation to 85% on RA.  He was also
tachycardiac to 110s.  He required NRB to maintain oxygenation.
ED was concerned for pulmonary edema vs. PE.  Repeat CXR did not
show marked pulmonary edema.  CTA could not be done as patient
had reaction to contrast in past (renal failure).  VQ scan could
not be performed given right sided lung mass.  Patient received
lovenox 100 mg SC x1, 30 mg oxycodone x2 (home dose), vancomycin
1 gram IVx1, ceftriaxone, albuterol/atrovent nebulizer
treatments, zofran 4 mg IV x1, and dilaudid 1 mg x1.  Vitals on
transfer are: 98.4, 108, 130s - 140s, RR 28, 95% on NBR.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient feels much better. Dyspnea has
completely resolved.  He is not sure what caused the acute onset
dyspnea, but feels like he may have had a panick attack.

Images:
b/l Lower extremity ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: No DVT of the bilateral lower extremities.

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.
Redemonstrated is a posterior right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] opacity,
unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is mildly prominent, but no
overt pulmonary edema is seen. No large pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.

IMPRESSION:  Right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] opacity may represent pneumonia,
though in the absence of infectious symptoms, further evaluation
is warranted with CT.

Chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] mass like consolidation, extending to the
hilum and into the posterior segment of the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**],
contains bronchiectasis and/or cavities.  Mediastinal
adenopathy.  Findings could be due to pneumonia or
bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma. Followup is recommended after
treatment to document resolution.
2. Sub-centimeter nodular opacities in the superior segment of
the left lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent additional sites of
infection.

The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2182-6-19**]. As per
OSH report,
patient presented had fever, cough and leukocytosis two weeks
ago and is
currently on treatment for pneumonia.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2182-6-19**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild right ventricular dilation. At least
moderate pulmonary hypertension. Mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm at 90 BPM, normal axis deviation, normal
intervals, TWI in III, TWF in aVF
