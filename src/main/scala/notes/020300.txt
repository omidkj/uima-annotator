Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with cauterization

History of Present Illness:
62 yo man with HTN, CRI, muscular dystrophy admitted to [**Hospital 5871**]
[**Hospital 12018**] Med Ctr on [**2-25**] with episode of SSCP associated with
diaphoresis, palpitation and shortness of breath, followed by
episode of vomitting blood.  At OSH EKG with ST depressions on
II, III, aVF, and V4-6, CE peaked at CK of 498 and TropI of 9.
He was started on IV heparin for ACS. However, he was noted to
have acute hct drop from 30 to 20 on [**2-26**] while PTT was
supratherapeutic at >100.  He had no hematemesis at OSH, no
BRBPR or melena.  He had EGD on [**2-27**] which showed active oozing
from GE junction from at least 3 sites which were cauterized. He
went for repeat EGD on [**2-28**] which showed very friable mucosa but
no evidence of varice or Dieulafoyd. Mucosal bx were taken given
concern of malignancy. He was transferred here for management of
UGIB. Of note, he had 7 u PRBC at OSH but hct remained stable
since [**2-27**].

Brief Hospital Course:
1)GI Bleed: Arrived here on [**3-1**] and EGD showed showed adherent
clot at gastric cardia which was injected with epinephrine and
cauterized by BICAP. Pt treated with high dose PPI.  Required
only one blood transfusion at [**Hospital1 18**] and this was once pt was
stable for anemia of chronic disease.  Plan was to follow up
with outpt GI Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61433**].
.
2)NSTEMI: During peri-bleed period, pt was tachycardic with
slight increase i cardiac enzymes but EKG without active
ischemic changes. Cardiology was consulted and felt that
catheterization was not emergently necessary and would not be
constructive as pt would not tolerate Plavix in per-GI bleed
period.  Cardiology suggested outpt stress MIBI.  This was
discussed with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who agreed to coordinate this for
the pt.  Aspirin was started but Lipitor held give nl
cholesterol and complication of Muscular Dystrophy. Beta blocker
titrated up.
.
3) Renal failure: Appeared to be chronic.  Per PCP last
creatinine over 10 years ago was normal.  Minimal response to
fluids, no obstruction, protein in urine.  Pt creatinine,
Bicarbobate, and electrolytes remained stable and pt was
referred for outpt renal MR and follow up with renal.  His PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed to coordinate this for him. Pt was treated for
elevated phosphorus with amphogel.
.
4)HTN: Very difficult to control, responded well when calcium
channel blocker and ACE inhibitor were added.  Maximal control
desired as pt with recent NSTEMI.
.

5)He was noted to be slightly hyperkalemic - perhaps due to his
ace inhibitor.  It was lower at 5.1 at discharge and we
reccomended he get followup in the next day to confirm its
stability. He agreed to have this done at his PCPs office and
would arrange transportation for the same.
.
6)Hematuria: This was in setting of removal of foley.  This will
need to be rechecked as outpatient.
