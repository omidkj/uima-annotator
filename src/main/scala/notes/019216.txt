Pentoxifylline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS; hypoxia at rehab

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD line removal and replacement


History of Present Illness:
70 yo M with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems including ESRD on HD
M/W/F iwth HD line that was changed [**6-11**], diabetes (? not on
insulin per discharge meds from earlier this month), sCHF EF
40%, HTN, HLP, boderline PD who was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] after a stay for hypoglycemia. He was discharged to rehab
then had an observation stay for a clotted HD catheter and sent
back to rehab on [**7-23**]. Now presents with desaturation at
rehab/HD. He was going to be a direct admit but then was brought
to the ED. He had HD on Thursday and Friday. At rehab he had
rhales and was satting 87% on 1L NC.
.
On day of admit patient was having some confusion and yelling
then became somnolent. A BS was 153 and his O2 was increased to
4L NC and his sats improved to 92%. He was given 120 IV lasix
and zaroxylyn 10mg. He was in the process of being ruled out for
C. diff as he had diarrhea after completion of ABX. No fevers.
He recieved 10mg oxycontin at 2pm and 5mg oxycodone at 12pm.
.
In the ED initial vitals were 97 81 89/70 22 98 NRB. A head CT
was done which showed no acute intracranial process and stable
ventriculomegaly, a CXR showed worsening left sided retrocardiac
opacity, atelectasis and pleural effusion. He was given
vancomycin. A UA showed many WBCs and many bacteria and mod
leuks. 60, 107/62, 12, 100 NRB. He was admitted to the ICU for
presumed sepsis.
.
On the floor he relays to me that he has been having a cough for
1-2 months, dysuria for 1-2 months and worsening diarrhea x 1
day. He complains of right heel pain. He reports chest pain only
when he coughs and unchanged shortness of breath. He is not sure
if his weight is increased or decreased.

CXR ([**2167-7-25**]) - IMPRESSION: Increasing retrocardiac density
likely reflects worsening atelectasis/partial lung collapse and
left-sided pleural effusion. However, an underlying infectious
process cannot be excluded.

CT Head ([**2167-7-25**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Ventriculomegaly is stable when compared to the prior study of
[**2167-3-2**]. This again could be due to central atrophy.
However, in the appropriate clinical setting, normal pressure
hydrocephalus is again a consideration.

CTA Chest ([**2167-7-26**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Large left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.  Moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion also
with adjacent atelectasis.  Ground glass opacities are noted in
the left lower lobe could represent infectious/inflammatory
process or partial atelectasis.
3. Secretions noted within the distal trachea.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems including ESRD on HD
M/W/F, diabetes (not on insulin per discharge meds from earlier
this month), sCHF FE 40%, HTN, HLP, boderline PD who was hypoxic
today at rehab to 80s and admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and
hypotension.
.
# HYPOXIA: He was quickly weaned from a non-rebreather to 2-3L
on arrival to the ICU.  His respiratory status varied while he
was in the ICU.  At times he required a non-rebreather.  He had
a CTA which showed no PE.  He was treated with an 8 day course
of Vanc/Zosyn for health-care associated pneumonia.  Fluid was
removed with dialysis but he was not markedly volume-overloaded
on exam.  He was noted to be aspirating while in the hospital.
He failed speech and swallow evaluation.  After discussion
regarding his goals of care, he was made DNR/DNI and was allowed
to eat for comfort.  His oxygen saturation was 92-95% on 2L NC
and we stopped checking his oxygen levels.
.
# HYPOTENSION: At times he was displaying septic physiology but
blood pressures run low normally.  He never required pressors.
His mental status waxed and waned but he often mentated well
with blood pressures in the 60s-70s systolic.  He had a arterial
line which was removed.  His baseline blood pressures have
ranged from 50s-100s systolic and he was mentating fine.  We
stopped checking blood pressures.
.
# C. DIFF: Has had C. Diff in the past and was having
significant diarrhea during this hospitalization.  He was
started on PO Vancomycin which should be continued indefinately.
 He had repeat C. Diff studies which were negative but given the
high suspicion, he was given PO Vancomycin.  Per ID
recommendations, this should continue indefinately.  He was
initially on Vancomycin 250mg PO q6 while on antibiotics.  When
antibiotics were stopped, this was changed to 125mg PO q6.  He
is getting Immodium for diarrhea.
.
# ENTEROCOCCUS BACTEREMIA:  He had 1 of 6 blood cultures
positive on admission for Enterococcus bacteremia.  This was via
a femoral stick in the ED.  Due to the high rate of
catheter-related infections, his HD line and PICC line were
removed.  He had a temporary HD line placed in his right femoral
vein.  This was converted to a tunneled HD line on [**2167-8-4**].  He
completed a course of antibiotic (first ampicillin, then
Vanc/Zosyn) to treat this infection.  He was evaluated for upper
extremity access and he was found to have bilateral upper
extremity clots which prevented him from recieving a line.
.
# [**Female First Name (un) **] UTI: His urine grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans and he was
treated with Fluconazole for 7 days, ending on [**2167-8-6**].
.
# BILATERAL RENAL MASSES: He was noted to have bilateral renal
masses on a CT scan dating back to [**2167-2-19**].  He has outpatient
urology follow-up on [**2167-8-13**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3748**].  It is
unclear if this is renal cell carcinoma.
