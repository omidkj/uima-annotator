Allergies:
aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, right flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63-year-old woman with a history of bilateral PE, RLL
infarct and RLE DVT in [**4-/2158**] on coumadin who presents with
hypotension noted at [**Hospital1 1501**] to 70/40. Patient had RLQ abd pain.
History of light-headedness with syncope on standing, multiple
episodes. Denied chest pain, dyspnea.
.
In the ED, patient triggered for BP of 68/40.  Stat HCT was
performed which showed HCT of 21 from previous baseline of 40.
INR was 4.3. CR was elevated to 3.9 from previous baseline of
0.6 on [**6-6**].  Trop was 0.05.  LFTs were flat. Patient was
transfused 2U PRBC, 2U FFP and reveresed with 10mg PO vitamin K.
 A bedside u/s was performed which showed no evidence of
pericardial effusion and good LV squeeze.  EKG showed SR at 62
without evidence of STEMI.  CT abd/pelv was performed which
showed evidence of a large right pelvic RP hematoma and second
RP hematoma in the right psoas muscle.  Since this was a non-con
CT, active extravasation was unable to be determined.  Surgery
was consulted down in the ED and felt patient had no active
surgical issues and recommended admission to MICU with IR made
aware of patient.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was alert and oriented to
person, place, year, month, but not date.  She reported that she
fell onto her bed about 1 week prior to this admission.  Had a
negative right hip x-ray at rehab, but continued to have
increased right sided sharp pain over the next 2 days with
associated nausea and decreased appetite.  Denied CP/SOB.
Reported that she was slightly confused on night prior to
arrival.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2158-6-16**]:
1.  A 16 cm right pelvic retroperitoneal hematoma of unclear
site of origin in addition to smaller right psoas hematoma. As
this is a non-contrast study, there is no ability to assess for
continued extravasation.
2.  Fatty liver.
3.  15 x 18 mm right inguinal node.
4.  Right lower long opacity likely relates to prior pulmonary
infarct.
.
LENIs
No thrombus identified within the veins of the right leg.
Partial chronic
thrombus seen in the left popliteal vein and in the distal
portion of the left superficial femoral vein.  No acute DVT is
identified in either leg.
.
ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is an abnormal systolic flow
contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow obstruction.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with hyperdynamic LV systolic
function. An abnormal LVOT flow contour is seen but an LVOT
gradient is not present. No signifcant valvular abnormality
seen.
.
CXR [**2158-6-18**]
Small region of consolidation or scar-like opacity in the right
lower lobe
laterally is barely visible on the conventional chest
radiograph.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size normal.  No
pleural abnormality or evidence of central lymph node
enlargement.

CXR [**2158-6-21**]
Left PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  Substantial
improvement in the right basilar aeration is demonstrated with
still present bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  No
pneumothorax is seen.

CTU [**2158-6-24**]
1.  Large right intrapelvic hematoma, with leftward inferior
mass effect upon the neighboring uterus and bladder. The size of
this hematoma is unchanged since [**2158-6-16**].  There is no
active contrast extravasation. The location and orientation of
this hematoma suggests a possible right adnexal origin.
2.  New mild right hydronephrosis, likely secondary to
mid-ureteral
obstruction from the hematoma.
3.  Stable separate small right psoas hematoma.
4.  Colonic diverticulosis, with no evidence of diverticulitis.
5.  No active extravasation detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63-year-old woman with a history of DVT and PE on
coumadin who presents with hypotension and right flank pain from
rehab facility found to have very large right retroperitoneal
bleed while on supratherapeutic warfarin and lovenox. She was
resuscitated with blood products and fluid and anticoagulation
was held until she was stable. She also had [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved
with holding cyclosporine and volume resuscitation as well.
.
#  Acute Blood Loss Anemia, SHOCK/BLEED:  Patient presented with
RP bleed on CT abd/pelv without contrast. Unable to assess for
active extravasation in the setting of non-con CT. INR 4.3 on
arrival. Received 6 units PRBC and 5 units FFP and was reversed
with 10mg vitamin K and 50mg Protamine.  Surgery and IR felt
there was no need for intervention.  Her hematocrits were
subsequently stable. Echo showed hyperdynamic LV and normal RV
function.  Patient afebrile with stable leukocytosis and no
source of infection to suggest alternative source of
hypotension. Given stable hematocrits and how recently she had
had her pulmonary emboli, she was started on IV heparin w
