History of Present Illness: 76 year old right handed woman with
history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2117**]'s, htn, hyperchol, who was
feeling well until 11 a.m. today when she told her husband she

thump.  He found her lying on the bathroom floor, mumbling
incoherently, with her right leg crossed over her left.  He
called his daughter who came over to the house, then she called
EMS.

flexion of right leg to noxious stimuli on either side.  Moves
left arm and leg vigorously antigravity. Normal tone.

Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  Plantar
response extensor on right initially, later mute.

Sensory: Responds more vigorously to noxious stimuli on the
left,
readily but less vigorously in right leg, no response to
pinprick
in right arm.

CTA [**2134-5-23**]:
CONCLUSION: No evidence of infarction on the non-contrast CT
scan.

Profound prolongation of mean transit time throughout the left
middle cerebral artery distribution. The blood volume appears
largely preserved, although somewhat decreased in the anterior
temporal lobe.

Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery during its M1
course, just distal to the origin of an anterior temporal
branch.

CT head [**2134-5-24**]:
FINDINGS: There is mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci
in an atrophic pattern. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or
acute infarction.
There is a tiny focal hypodensity in the left putamen,
suggesting an old lacunar infarction. There have been no
significant changes since the head CT of [**2134-5-23**].

CXR [**2134-5-27**]:
There is significant improvement in previously demonstrated
severe pulmonary edema being now of a mild degree. Bilateral
pleural effusions are again noted. The heart size is markedly
enlarged but stable and the patient is after CABG.

CONCLUSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.

CT C-spine [**2134-5-24**]:
FINDINGS: Alignment is normal. No fractures are identified.
There are mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine that
cause mild narrowing of the spinal canal but no suggestion of
spinal cord compression. Noncontrast CT has limited intraspinal
soft tissue resolution and cannot evaluate the possibility of
disc, hematoma, or other soft tissue abnormalities inside the
spinal canal. There are large bilateral pleural effusions,
incompletely evaluated on this study.

CONCLUSION: No evidence of fracture or subluxation

Echocardiogram [**2134-5-24**]:

The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Preserved
global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen.


Right knee x-ray [**2134-5-27**]:

Degenerative changes of the right knee including medial
compartment joint space narrowing. No definite fracture is seen;
previous finding reflected a projecting osteophyte.
Chondrocalcinosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
1. Neurology: Patient received IV TPA in ED for NIHSS of 15 and
admitted to Neurology ICU for observation and post-IV TPA
protocol. Patient was noted to have no neurological deficits
within 24 hours. She was noted to have atrial fibrillation on
admission and stroke was thought to be cardioembolic in
etiology. The patient was started on heparin and coumadin. Once
INR was therapeutic heparin discontinued and patient continued
on Coumadin 3 mg po qday. She was transferred to the floor once
medically stable. Lipid panel TG 86, HDL 43, and LDL 75, Hgb A1c
5.7%. She worked with PT/OT once her knee pain improved.

2. CV: Echocardiogram done and showed moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She was
treated with Lasix as needed for moderate to severe pulmonary
edema which improved to mild pulmonary edema on repeat CXR. She
was ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x 3.

3. Respiratory: Patient was on oxygen nasal cannula during the
duration of hospitalization which was thought to be related to
pulmonary edema. She was treated with intermittent Lasix.

4. FEN/GI: Tolerated regular diet.

5. MSK: Patient had a fall after stroke. She had C-spine CT
which was read as no evidence of fracture. She complained of
right knee pain. X-rays showed that there was DJD but no
evidence of fracture. She was placed in knee immobilizer and
worked with PT/OT.
6. Rehab: Given's patient's deconditioning during this hospital
stay, it was though she would benefit from inpatient
rehabilitation.
