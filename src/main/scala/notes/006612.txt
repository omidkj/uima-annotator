Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2170-10-9**] where
she underwent AVR, CABG x 3 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  See operative note
for further details.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Post-operative day one found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  She was started on Plavix
instead of aspirin due to a history of aspirin allergy.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  She was restarted on her
home medications of ciprofloxacin and prednisone.  By the time
of discharge on post-operative day four the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  She was discharged to home with
appropriate follow up instructions.
