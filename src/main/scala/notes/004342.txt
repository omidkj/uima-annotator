Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
chronic mesenteric ischemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mesenteric Angio [**7-9**]
R heart cath [**7-11**]
Open Antegrade Superior Mesenteric Artery bypass with graft
[**2103-7-12**]


History of Present Illness:
66M with PVD and left fem to PT bypass with RGSV four months
ago for claudication who presented to an outside hospital
several
days ago with one month of intermittent abdominal pain and 100
pound weight loss over the past three years and 20 pounds over
the last month. Imaging was concerning for celiac and SMA
stenosis with infra-renal aortic aneurysm and bilateral renal
artery infarcts. Catheterization was attempted but aborted given
SMA occlusion. Given multiple comorbid conditions and the
complexity of his disease, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.  At [**Hospital1 18**] he reports chronic abdominal pain
which is rather diffuse. He states that it has been worse over
the past week, is exacerbated by eating and is associated with
diarrhea. He reports that his claudication resolved after his
lower extremity bypass.


Past Medical History:
CAD w severe MI ten years ago, CHF, Grave's disease
treated with PTU, SBO, history of [**Last Name (un) **] now resolved, COPD, afib
(hx of coum), parastomal hernia, renal infarct, SMA stenosis,
active smoker (75 pack yr; cut down to 4-5/day), cirrhosis, Pulm
htn, right heart strain, ischemic left leg


Social History:
100 pack year smoking history. heavy history of etoh with
over 24 beverages consumed daily but has not had an alcoholic
beverage in several years


Family History:
sister with lung cancer at 37 yeras of age and another sister
with stomach cancer in 70's. Brother with CAD.

NOTES:


  Dx: SOB, Pre-operatory Assessment Medication: Unidentified
inhaler not
  taken prior to testing BMI: 21 Hgb: 14.0 ([**2103-7-10**]) Good
test
  quality and reproducibility for spirometry and lung volumes.
FVC may be
  underestimated due to early termination of exhalation in all
efforts. Effort
  reported is a composite. SVC is likely underestimated due to
early
  termination of exhalation in all efforts. Good/fair test
quality with poor
  reproducibility for diffusion capacity. only one effort
reported due to
  unreportable test quality in all other efforts.

  Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are moderately reduced. The
FEV1/FVC ratio is
  elevated.
  Flow-Volume Loop: Moderate restrictive pattern with an abrupt
and early
  termination of exhalation.
  Lung Volumes: The TLC is mildly reduced. The FRC and RV are
normal. The
  RV/TLC ratio is elevated.
  DLCO: The Diffusing Capacity corrected for hemoglobin is
moderately reduced.

  Impression:
  Mild restrictive ventilatory defect with a moderate gas
exchange defect.
  The FVC is likely underestimated due to an early termination
of exhalation
  and for this reason a coexisting obstructive component cannot
be excluded.
  There are no prior studies available for comparison.

COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics had marked variation due to atrial
fibrillation
and respiration. Resting measurements revealed a maximal PASP 58
mmHg
with an average of 48 mmHg, a mean PA pressure of 34 mmHg, and a
mean
PCWP of 14 mmHg.
2. Measurements on 100% FiO2 were obtained after over 50 minutes
due to
difficulties with arterial access and ability to record a wedge
pressure
with the PA catheter. The average PASP was 47 mmHg with a
maximal value
of 60 mmHg with a mean PA pressure of 34 mmHg. The PCWP was
measured to
be 24 mmHg but this was most likely a damped PA [**Location (un) 1131**] and not
a true
wedge pressure given subsequent PCWP after 100% inhaled NO.
3. With 100% inhaled NO, the PCWP was 15 mm Hg. There was a mild

improvement in PASP with an average of 42 mmHg, 52 mmHg maximal,
and
mean PA 30 mmHg. PVR improved from a baseline of 5.55 [**Doctor Last Name **] to 3.76
[**Doctor Last Name **].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild to moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with mild
elevation
of PCW at baseline (consistent with mild left ventricular
diastolic
dysfunction) and severely elevated PVR (using assumed oxygen
consumption).
2. Technically challenging RHC and vasodilator study due to
extreme
difficulty delivering catheters into the PCW position, requiring
>30
minutes of effort and 3 different catheters.
3. No improvement in PA pressure with 100% O2.
4. Mild improvement in PA systolic pressure, mean PA pressure
and PVR
with addition of inhaled nitric oxide 40 ppm to 100% O2.
5. No evidence of right-to-left or left-to-right shunts.
6. Additional plans per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].
