Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2042**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status and fall


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with metastatic prostate cancer now presenting
with delirium s/p fall. pt's wife called this am stating that
last night, pt was acting "crazy, not himself" and had an
unwitnessed fall. needs to come in for eval for delirium and s/p
fall. Wife reports that patient was not feeling well last night
and opted not to go out to dinner. This morning around 3am, came
into bedroom and fell. Patient reports falling onto bottom
without headstrike. + cough. No abdominal pain or dysuria.
Triggered on arrival for hypoxia. Patient on coumadin for
history of PE in [**Month (only) 1096**].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 99.0 120 110/64 18 84% RA.
Rectal temperature was 102.8, patient was guaiac negative.  CBC
was significant for white blood cell count 0.4K, ANC 144, no
bands, with hematocrit of 25.7 from baseline 30s, platelet count
of 36K.  Chem10 was significant for anion gap of 15.  Lactate
was 2.3.  INR was 3.8 with goal INR [**2-28**], and patient was given
10 mg IV vitamin K, FFP and platelets.  LFTs were unremarkable.
Troponin was normal.  Urinalysis showed 7 RBCs, 1 WBCs, no
leuks.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia to 112 bpm, nl axis, nl
intervals, with <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions inferolaterally.  Chest
X-ray showed possible left lower lobe consolidation.  CTA torso
showed no evidence of traumatic injury, no pulmonary emboli, but
with left lung base consolidation, likely infection or
aspiration.  CT head showed a 9 x 5 mm hyperattenuating focus
overlying the right frontal region, which may represent
intracranial hemorrhage or contusion, consider dural metastasis,
no fracture.  CT C-spine showed no acute fracture or
malalignment.  Patient received vancomycin/cefepime for febrile
neutropenia and likely pneumonia.  Heme/Onc was consulted and
stated that it was OK for patient to get platelets and reverse
INR. Neurosurgery was consulted who noted a small subdural
hemorrhage and recommended repeat head CT tomorrow ([**8-10**]).

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile to 102.8 and on 4LNC at 88%, so he was
placed on a non-rebreather and was satting 97% but
hypoventilating.  Pt triggered twice in the ED for BP (unclear
how low) and responded to 4L total NS.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T98.0 HR96 BP 108/56
R22 96% non rebreather. Pt was able to confirm limited history
as above. History was primarily obtained from wife.

Pt denied fevers, chills, though wife reports he has been
"clammy" and with rhinorhea the last few weeks, no shortness of
breath, chest pain, headaches, sore throat, diarrhea, some
constipation (baseline), no BRBPR, no melena, no dysuria, no
numbness/tingling, no new pain.

Social History:
The patient worked for a textile company that

his wife in [**Name (NI) 47**].  He has two daughters (one in CT and one
in CA) and one grandson.

Urine Culture [**8-11**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES),
CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

Blood cultures 7/16: PENDING

EKG [**8-9**]: Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST segment changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-1-21**] the rate has
increased.

CT C-spine w/out contrast [**8-9**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute
fracture or malalignment in c spine.  Multilevel degenerative
joint changes, as described above.  Diffuse sclerosis of the C7
vertebral body is compatible with patient's known history of
metastatic disease.  Associated soft tissue mass at that level
is better seen on prior MRI exam. Correlate clinically to decide
on the need for further workup.

CT Head w/out contrast [**8-9**]: IMPRESSION: 9 x 5 millimeter  dense
focus in the right frontal region is new since [**2127-1-21**] exam,
and may represent a focus of intracranial hemorrhage- subdural
with/without adjacent focus of contusion. Consider close
followup to exclude other etiologies such as dural based lesions
and if needed MRI if not CI.

CXR [**8-9**]: IMPRESSION:  Increased left basal opacity may reflect
developing pneumonia.

CTA Chest w/ and w/out contrast [**8-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of acute traumatic injury.  No evidence of acute
aortic
syndrome or PE. 2.  Left lung base consolidation, likely
infection or aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.  3.
 Multiple hepatic hypodense lesions, many of which appear stable
and compatible with hemangiomas.  A 1.2 x 1 cm hypodense lesion
in segment VII appears new since prior exams, concerning for
metastatic disease.
4.  A 1.4 x 1.5 cm hypodense lesion in the left adrenal gland is
new since
prior exam, incompletely characterized on today's exam, highly
concerning for a new metastatic focus.  5.  Focal renal
hypodensities, too small to characterize, likely cysts. 6.
Small hiatal hernia. 7.  Diffuse sclerotic lesions in the
visualized axial and appendicular skeleton, compatible with the
patient's known history of osseous metastatic disease, largely
unchanged since [**2127-6-10**].  Few areas suggestive of early
cortical breakthrough and impingment on central central canal.

CXR [**8-10**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
lung volumes have decreased.  As a consequence, there is
crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures at both lung
bases.  In addition, mild areas of atelectasis have newly
appeared, the atelectasis are more severe on the left than on
the right. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus,
potentially caused by a minimal pleural effusion.

CT Head w/out contrast [**8-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.  No interval change
in tiny right subdural hematoma compared with prior exam. 2.
Interval increase in concentric mucosal thickening of the left
maxillary sinus, concerning for acute sinusitis. 3. Small fat
containing focus anter
