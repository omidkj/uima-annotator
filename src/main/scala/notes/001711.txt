History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male with severe 3-vessel coronary
disease s/p complex PCI with 5 RCA bare metal stents placed in
[**2127**] (pt declined CABG), CHF with EF 40%, PVD, and seizure
disorder who is transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**] for management
of NSTEMI and anemia.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-4**] with complaints of
exertional dyspnea and chest/epigastric discomfort for the past
2 weeks. At baseline he can walk 2 miles and climb 1 flt of
stairs w/o chest pain or dyspnea, but over the past 2 weeks
these symptoms are brought on with only 50ft of walking and last
about 1 hour with improvement with rest. He denies orthopnea,
PND, LE edema, LH or palpitations. At his PCP he was found to
have Hct of 22.9 and was sent to [**Hospital3 4107**]. On
presentation to [**Hospital1 **] his EKG showed sinus tachycardia with
rate 100, IVCD, horizontal ST depression V2-V6. He was treated
conservatively with BB, ACE, aspirin, plavix, and blood
transfusion (3U). His chest pain completely resolved and he was
pain free during his admission. He ruled in with a NQWMI, trop I
peak of 23.7, CK peak 670.
With regards to his anemia, he first notes that he was found to
be anemic a few months ago (after complaining of exertional
dyspnea). He was trasfused 2U pRBCs with improvement in symptoms
and as workup had an upper GI series with barium swallow, but no
endoscopy or C-scope. He denies any abdominal pain (other than
with angina), early satiety, constipation, + loose stool. He
notes 1 episode of melena a few months ago, but none since. He
notes no other blood loss. Denies alcohol consumption or FH of
GI malignancy. His OSH labs did show a ferritin of 5.7 and MCV
79.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? ptx s/p ct removal

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? ptx s/p ct removal
INDICATION: 73-year-old man with status post CABG and chest tube
removal, evaluate for pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**2129-3-15**], 8:32 a.m. (9 hours prior to this
study).

SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: Interval removal of the chest tube and the
mediastinal drain. No evidence of pneumothorax. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, [**Year (4 digits) 1506**]. No new consolidations or
infiltrates are noted. Mild engorgement of the mediastinal
vasculature suggesting volume overload. Pleural calcifications
appear [**Year (4 digits) 1506**]. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in
standard locations. Median sternotomy wires are evident without
evidence of sternal dehiscence. Swan catheter in standard
location.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions
and mild volume overload [**Year (4 digits) 1506**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
