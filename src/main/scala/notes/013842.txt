History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, DM, CHF EF 35-40%,
afib, stage IV diabetic nephropathy (Cr 3.0) who presented to
the ED after a witness unresponsive episode. Per the family, he
was walking down the street and had a wittness loss of
consciousness. EMS was called and he was taken to [**Hospital 4199**]
hospital. On arrival (11:20am) he was in asystole. He was given
Epi X 3 and Atropine X 1. He then went into Vfib and shocked
(200 joules). He then went into Afib and became bradycardic.
Dopamine was started. He regained a perfusing rhythm at 11:35am.
He was given Calcium chloride, Magnesium, Amiodarone 300mg IV X
1 and bicarb during the resuscitation at [**Last Name (un) 4199**]. He later had
another episode of VT at 12:40 and an amiodarone gtt was
started. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Per [**Hospital1 18**] ED report, he had presented to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital in
Vfib, then became asystolic. After the initial resuscitation he
had 2 additional asystolic arrests in the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ER.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T98.2 HR75, BP149/106, RR32
100% on the vent. The post-arrest consult team was called and
recommended cooling him to 33-34 degrees and weaning his
propofol to fentanyl/versed. A R femoral line was placed, he was
given 1L IVF and had a head, chest, abdomen CT done without
contrast. He was kept on dopamine, propofol and amiodarone. He
was given 1mg Atropine for bradycardia to 35During transfer to
the floor, he became bradycardic. External pacer pad were placed
and his dopamine was increased from 15mcg/kg to 20mcg/kg. He was
briefly externally paced and given additional an additional 1mg
of Atropine. On arrival to the CCU he was not being paced and
his dopamine was back down to 15mcg/min. CT scan showed a
sternal fracture and mediastinal hematoma.

ROS unable to be obtained as the patient is intubated and
sedated.

STUDIES:
.
CXR ([**2117-1-16**]): Cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure.
Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in standard positions.
.
CT spine ([**2117-1-16**]):
1. No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
2. Pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion, partially imaged.

3. Multilevel degenerative changes, worst at C4-C5, which
predisposes the patient to cord injury. Consider MRI for further
evaluation if clinically indicated.
.
Non-contrast head CT ([**2117-1-16**]): NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation abnormality. The ventricles and extra-axial
spaces are appropriate for age. Intracranial carotid artery
atherosclerotic calcifications are moderate-to-severe. Mucosal
secretions within the nasal passages, nasopharynx, and
opacification of the ethmoid sinus air cells are noted, at least
partially related to recent intubation. There is mucosal
thickening in bilateral maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid
sinuses, mild in degree. Imaged mastoid air cells are clear.
There is no fracture. Mild prominence of the ventricles and
cerebral sulci is likely related to age-appropriate atrophy.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality. Sinus disease, as
noted above.
.
CT chest, abdomen, pelvis ([**2117-1-16**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly displaced transversefracture of the mid sternum likely
involves the medial aspect of the anterior left third rib with
associated substernal anterior mediastinal hematoma.
2. Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions
with associated atelectasis.
3. 1.9 cm right renal hypodense lesion, likely a complex cyst. A
renal ultrasound is recommended further evaluation.
4. Gallbladder wall edema and trace perihepatic ascites, likely
related to heart failure.
.
ECHO [**2117-1-18**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls,
distal anterior wall and distal lateral wall. There is an apical
left ventricular aneurysm. The remaining walls contract well
(LVEF 30-35%). No masses or throm
