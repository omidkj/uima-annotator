HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
female with right upper lobe lung cancer (on carboplatin and
Taxol) who was admitted the week prior with neutropenic
pneumonia and was discharged on levofloxacin from an outside
hospital.

Three days after this, she felt weak and was found on the
floor by her [**Hospital6 407**] with a temperature of
101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and she was sent to
[**Hospital3 15174**].

A [**Hospital3 15174**], the patient felt weak.  She
complained of shortness of breath and odynophagia.  She
denied fall, loss of consciousness, chest pain, back pain, or
shoulder pain.  The shortness of breath resolved the day
prior to admission.  Her throat pain also resolved on the
morning of admission spontaneously.

Review of records from [**Hospital3 15174**] revealed an
electrocardiogram from [**1-15**] with 1-mm to 2-mm ST
elevations.  She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a
creatine kinase of 309 and a troponin I of 3.97.  The patient
was started on aspirin, beta blocker, nitroglycerin drip, and
a heparin drip.  There was a question if the patient was
volume overloaded at the outside hospital.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further treatment on [**2179-1-16**].  She
currently denies shortness of breath, cough, chest pain,
throat pain, weakness, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting.
She also denied hemoptysis; however, there was a verbal
report of hemoptysis from the outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm of 5 cm.
 2.  Anemia.
 3.  Right upper lobe lung cancer (on carboplatin and Taxol).
 4.  Recent neutropenia.
 5.  Thrombocytopenia (with a baseline platelet count of
40,000 to 60,000).
 6.  History of breast cancer in [**2171**]; status post left
mastectomy and chemotherapy.
 7.  Gout.
 8.  Osteopenia.
 9.  Degenerative joint disease.
10.  Coronary artery disease; with episodes of chest pain up
to six years ago (details unknown).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She did smoke, but
she quit in [**2172**].  She denies alcohol or drug use.  Her only
relative in this country is a sister who lives in [**Name (NI) **],
[**State 5887**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is unknown.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Ceftazidime 1 gram intravenously twice per day.
 2.  Diovan 160 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Zocor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Verapamil-SR 120 mg by mouth once per day.
 5.  Advair 250/50 one inhalation twice per day.
 6.  Glipizide 2.5 mg by mouth twice per day.
 7.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 8.  Heparin drip.
 9.  Nitroglycerin drip was off on admission to [**Hospital1 346**] but was being given at the outside
hospital.
10.  Lopressor 1 mg intravenously times one and Lasix 20 mg
intravenously times one prior to admission.
11.  The patient last received chemotherapy on [**2178-12-29**].

ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98.3
degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 93, her respiratory
rate was 19, her blood pressure was 115/66, and her oxygen
saturation was 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  General
physical examination revealed the patient was in no acute
distress.  Lung examination revealed diffuse expiratory
wheezes with minimal crackles at the right base.  The patient
is status post left mastectomy.  The heart sounds were
normal.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 95 beats
per minute with normal axis and normal intervals.  There were
1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads V1 through V3.  There
were deep T wave inversions in leads V1 through V3.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The decision was made to
not emergently catheterize the patient given that she had
been symptom free for over 24 hours.  Continued aspirin, beta
blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker, statin, and heparin
drip.

Enzymes were cycled, and the patient ruled in for an
ST-elevation myocardial infarction.  Her troponin T level 48
hours outside the event of 0.33.

The patient did go to the Catheterization Laboratory the
following day which revealed 2-vessel coronary artery
disease; in the left circumflex artery and the right coronary
artery.  There was successful metal stenting of the ostial
left circumflex lesion.  The patient was also noted to have
severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

An echocardiogram at the outside hospital noted an ejection
fraction of 35%; however, the patient had no overt signs of
heart failure during this hospital admission.  The patient
was continued on her angiotensin receptor blocker.  The
patient was continued on her aspirin, beta blocker, statin,
and angiotensin receptor blocker.

2.  HEMOPTYSIS ISSUES:  During this hospitalization, the
patient was noted to have significant hemoptysis.  The
Pulmonary Service was consulted, and they recommended holding
the heparin and checking a computed tomography scan with
contrast.  This revealed a consolidation within the right
hilar region causing obstruction of the bronchus of the
anterior segment of the right upper lobe where there was
distal increase interstitial and alveolar opacity consistent
with postobstructive pneumonitis and/or lymphangitic spread.
It was negative for a pulmonary embolism.  There was no
evidence of bronchovascular communication.

It was most likely that the hemoptysis was due to her
non-small-cell lung cancer as well as her pneumonia.
