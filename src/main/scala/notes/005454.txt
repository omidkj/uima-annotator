2. Labs on discharge:
Na 142, K 4.6, Cl 100, HCO3 35, BUN 30, Cr 1.5
.
3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- Echocardiogram ([**2131-4-2**]):
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
- CXR ([**2131-4-1**]):
No new focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
No pulmonary edema. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, with
unchanged right rib deformities and right mid lung opacity.
.
- CXR ([**2131-4-3**]):
New mild pulmonary edema and new left small pleural effusion.
Stable moderate right lung base opacity. Stable mild
cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta. Stable deformity of the right
hemithorax secondary to old posterior rib fractures.
.
- CXR ([**2131-4-5**]):
As compared to the previous examination, there is a massive
improvement. The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting
improved
ventilation. The size of the cardiac silhouette is decreased.
There is no
evidence of pulmonary edema. A focal parenchymal opacity on the
right is
unchanged. This opacity, however, is located near old rib
fractures and could reflect pleural thickening.

Status post sternotomy and valve replacement. No pleural
effusions.
Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. An old right humeral fracture
could be
present.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with CAD, dCHF, PAF not on Coumadin, and bovine [**Age over 90 1291**] who
presented from [**Hospital3 **] facility after two weeks of
progressive fatigue and decreased po intake, found to have ARF,
leukocytosis, and pneumonia.
.
Patient admitted [**2131-4-1**] to the MICU with SOB, fevers, hypoxia
consistent with fever and CXR intially unclear. By [**2131-4-3**],
developed infiltrate consistent with PNA. Flu swab negative. No
diarrhea to suggest C. diff. TTE on [**2131-4-2**] showed no interval
change since [**2130-5-10**] with EF normal, normal [**Month/Day/Year 1291**]. Patient was not
on coumadin due to fall risk.
.
Patient initially treated with vanc/levoflox for pneumonia.
After resolution of fever and leukocytosis, she was transitioned
to po levofloxacin and will complete a 10-day course after
discharge. She was treated with IV furosemide boluses for
pulmonary edema. CXR showed d
