Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD)
Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)
Left femoral Hickman line replacement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 47 yo F with [**Location (un) **] syndrome s/p colectomy,
repeated small bowel resections, and resultant short gut
syndrome on TPN since [**2123**] c/b with multiple line infections and
clotted veins. She was recently admitted on [**2146-8-23**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for sepsis. Although no clear source was found, she was streated
iwht IV fluconazole and daptomycin for her history of fungemia
and multiple line infections. She had a TEE that was negative
for endocarditis. She was discharged on [**2146-9-2**] on daptomycin
and fluconazole. Of note, during this hospitalization, she had
new word-finding difficulties and a noncontrast head CT
demonstrated a new interval focus of hypodensity in the L basal
ganglia, concerning for acute to subacute ischemia, and new
subtle hypodensity at the left cerebellum, also concerning for
acute ischemia. However, she could not tolerate CTs with
contrast or MRIs so no further imaging was performed. Neurology
felt her symptoms did not correlate with the CT findings.

Today she presented to the ED with painful petechie all over her
hands, feet, and legs. Her mother took her VS this morning at
10AM, which were 100.5, 119, 98/60, 28. She had bilious vomiting
and was shaking. She was noted to have large petechiae on her
entire body, including pams and soles.

In the ED, initial VS: 98.5, 128, 98/64, 20, 96 on RA. She was
dropping her SBP in 60s-70s, which somewhat responded to 3L NS.
She received meropenam and is ordered for daptomycin and
micafungin per ID. IR has been notifed of new line needs and
will take her case next. Current VS are: afeb, 82/49, 112, 19,
97-100% on 4L.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.
