CXR:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-18**], the monitoring
and support
devices have been removed. Specifically, there is no interval.
There is no
pneumothorax. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists
with some
diffuse prominence of interstitial markings consistent with
elevated pulmonary venous pressure.

ECHO:

Pt presented for pericardectomy. LV systolic function was normal
with no segmental wall motion abnormalities and a LVEF>55%. The
valves are essentially normal. RV function was normal. A patent
foramen ovale is present. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. The pericardium appears thickened. Lateral mitral
annular tissue Doppler measures E' 19cm/sec.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2-18**] where the
patient underwent Pericardiectomy. Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.


POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.

Chest tubes were discontinued without complication.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 3 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.

The patient was discharged [**2-21**] in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
