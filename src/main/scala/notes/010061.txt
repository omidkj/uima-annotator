NOTE:  This is an addendum to a discharge summary dictated
previously.

On [**2134-3-19**], the patient was transferred from intensive
medical care to regular medical floor.  His course in the
Intensive Care Unit was as described in the discharge summary
from [**2134-3-19**].  While on the floor, the patient remained
afebrile.  His hematocrit stayed stable, around 25 to 27
mark.  His stools remained guaiac negative.  He was continued
on his ceftriaxone and Flagyl for Klebsiella, sepsis/liver
abscess/pneumonia.  He underwent an abdominal ultrasound
which revealed non liquefied abscess at the level of the
porta hepatis that measured 4.3 x 5.5 cm.  It was unchanged
in its characteristic an appearance in comparison to prior
exam dated [**3-12**].  There was no intra or extraductal dilation.
The gallbladder was unremarkable.  There was no
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.

The general plan for this patient was to continue for an
additional two weeks on intravenous antibiotics.  He is to
have a repeat ultrasound of his liver to evaluate the
progress of liquefaction of the liver abscess.  He will be
followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 481**] from the infectious disease
division.  He has an appointment with the fellow as well as
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15716**] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**4-9**] at 10:00 in the morning
in [**Doctor Last Name 780**] Building on the [**Location (un) **].  At that time, decision
about further antibiotic treatment as well as possible
interventional radiology drainage will be made.  The patient
is to complete additional two weeks of intravenous
antibiotics in attempt to liquefy the abscess for easier
interventional radiology drainage.  In case interventional
radiology would not be able to drain the abscess, surgery may
have to become involved.
