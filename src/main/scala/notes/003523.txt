Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64yo M with peripheral vascular disease (s/p left AKA),
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and right deep venous thrombosis transferred from [**Hospital **]. He was at home and fell out of his wheelchair yesterday,
and couldn't get off the floor. Denies head trauma. Was taken to
[**Hospital3 **] and evaluated, then pt asked to be transferred here
because he has gotten most of his care here.
.
Prior to arrival, the patient got solumedrol and levofloxacin at
[**Hospital3 **] hospital. He got vanc and flagyl here. In our ED, he
was noted to have cough, wheezes, and bruises. He was found to
be hypoxic to 86% on RA on arrival, which improved to 99% on 4L
after nebs. VBG was 7/26/63/22. CXR showed possible left sided
pneumonia, but CT abdomen showed a left base pneumonia. The
abdominal CT also showed a large hematoma consistent with his
exam and history of falls. Though his creatinine was elevated,
the ED considered a CTA to rule out PE in the setting of a
positive D-dimer at [**Hospital3 **]; then considered a VQ scan but the
decision was made to defer these studies to the floor team. He
also had an elevated troponin of 0.05 and CK of 2935 (MB 24,
index 0.8) and was given aspirin. Cards was notified, but the
decision for official consult was deferred to floor team. The
patient was admitted to the MICU due to "tenuous respiratory
status". He is DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64M with history of PVD and COPD presents s/p fall with
COPD exacerbation, PNA, and RLE cellulitis/vascular insuficiency
who expired in the MICU.

#) COPD exacerbation +/- PNA - Admitted to ICU for O2sat in the
80's on room air but mid 90's on 3L NC.  Pt neg for influenza.
Started on Levofloxacin for COPD exacerbation and a question of
retrocardiac opacity on CXR. Also started on Nebulizers and
Prednisone IV then tapered to 60mg PO. Following stabilization
in the MICU, his floor course was marked by waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
respiratory status with O2sats ranging from 88-96% on a
significant O2 requirement (3-4L, patient is not on oxygen at
home). He recieved a 7 day course of Levofloxacin and 6 days of
Prednisone 60mg. He benefited from Chest PT and clearance of
secretions with improved clinical exam and O2sats. His O2sats
were thought to be lowered in his digits by the presence of
significant PVD and forehead O2sats were obtained showing better
saturation. Given waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] respiratory status and
O2sats, a repeat CXR was performed which was essentially
unchanged and did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process.
A Chest CT was also performed to r/o any evidence of mucus plug
and showed tracheobronchomalacia, collapse of the LLL concerning
for PE, and R pericardic triangular opacity. The patient was
started on Heparin IV drip and given NaHCO3 in D5W and a CTA was
obtain that showed no PE. Subsequently, patient's sats dropped
to 83 % on 4 L. He was given nebs and the 96% on 4L but sats
dropped to 85% on 4L again and Bp dropped to 90s systolic.
Patient was disoriented and denied any complaints VBG
7.36/86/47. He was transferred to the ICU for further management
where his respiratory status continued to worsen. Diuresis was
attempted with lasix but the pt did not have much UOP. O2 sats
were lowered to the low 90's given pt's somnolence and concern
for CO2 retention, but he continued to remain somnolent. He
became diaphoretic and tachycardic and was started on BiPAP.
Multiple ABG's were attempted but only venous blood was
obtained. His family was notified that his clinical status was
declining and they felt that he would only want intubation if it
would be a quick turn around. However, given his poor lung
function it was felt that the pt's course on the ventilator
would likely be long. His family felt he would not want this,
and thus the pt was made CMO. He expired a few hours later.
.
#) RLE pain/erythema: There was a 1.5x1.5 inch circular scabbed
ulcer involving the medial malleolus with surrounding erythema.
The patient stated that he had had the ulcer for approximately
2-4 weeks. The foot was thought to be cold on exam in the MICU
and he did not have a DPP pulse by doppler u/s. He remained
afebrile throughout his course and was start4d on Vancomycin due
to concern for cellulitis and his history of MRSA cellulitis.
Given his severe PVD, vascular insufficiency was also a
potential cause of the pain, erythema, and ulcer formation.
Vascular surgery was consulted and they performed a RLE
arteriogram revealing severe vascular insufficiency. Vein
mappping of the upper extremities was performed and a candidate
graft from the left upper extremity was identified. Per vascular
surgery, the wound care included dry dressing changes with
accuzyme QD.
.
#) Elevated troponin/CK - CK elevation most likely from fall.
Trop more likely from renal insufficiency. EKG without acute
changes. Assymptomatic.

#) Renal failure -
