HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
subarachnoid hemorrhage status post left middle cerebral
artery clipping, left craniectomy, and VP shunt, who presents
from [**Hospital 582**] nursing home with decreased responsiveness per
her daughter for the past few days.  The patient was
diagnosed with proteus urinary tract infection on [**2196-4-18**].
She was started on amoxicillin 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. x7 days,
but the sensitivity also showed proteus resistant to
ampicillin.  The fingerstick blood sugar prior to [**Location (un) 582**] had
been 538 for which she was given 12 units of insulin on the
date of presentation.  She was also found to have a
temperature of 100.3 at [**Location (un) 582**].

On arrival to the Emergency Room, she was thought to have
urosepsis, and was given one dose of vancomycin IV given her
history of MRSA, but no additional antibiotics.  She was also
found to have a sodium of 164, which when corrected was 170
and a glucose of 463.  She was treated with 2 liters of
normal saline.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.8,
hematocrit 33.4, platelets 140.  Sodium 164, potassium 3.9,
chloride 123, bicarb 32, BUN 54, creatinine 0.9, glucose 463,
lactate 3.0.  PT 12.7, PTT 22.5, INR 1.1.  Urinalysis
revealing moderate leukocyte esterase, large blood, 30
protein, 100 glucose, trace ketones, and no nitrites, greater
than 50 epithelial cells.

Chest x-ray revealed no evidence of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.

An EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 117 beats per minute,
normal axis, T-wave inversions in lead III, no ST segment
changes.

An ABG was obtained on 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula:
pH 7.37, CO2 55, oxygen 169.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 64-year-old female with a
history of multiple medical problems, who presents with
urosepsis.

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient was
found to be severely hypernatremic with an initial sodium of
164, which when corrected for the hyperglycemia, it was 170.
She was given normal saline boluses.  She was started on
maintenance fluid of D5 [**1-15**] normal saline with 20 mEq of
potassium for 2 liters, and then this was run continuously.
Ultimately, her sodium corrected to within normal limits and
is 138 at the time of this dictation.  Patient was also
started on free water boluses via her PEG tube, which
initially were 500 cc q.4h. and decreased to 250 cc q.4h. by
the time of discharge.

Her tube feeds were started and she was given ProMod tube
feeds with fiber and reached her goal of 55 cc an hour by the
time of discharge.

2. Endocrine:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
She was initially placed on an insulin drip, which was
discontinued on [**2196-4-24**].  Her admitting blood glucose was
greater than 400 and had decreased to the 200 range by the
time of discharge.  Her metformin was restarted and gradually
increased her home dose of 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.

3. Genitourinary:  The patient was admitted with a urinary
tract infection.  The urine culture was found to be sensitive
to ceftriaxone, and therefore the patient was started on
[**2196-4-24**] 1 gram of ceftriaxone IV q.d.  It is suggested
that she continues for a full two-week course given that this
is a complicated urinary tract infection obtained while the
patient had a Foley in place.  Her repeat urine culture was
negative.

The patient had a renal ultrasound performed to rule out
obstruction, which was questionable for emphysematous
pyelonephritis.  Therefore, CAT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis was obtained, which revealed no pleural effusions,
minor bibasilar atelectasis, no hepatic or splenic lesions,
correct position of the G tube, all other organs within
normal limits, but multiple bilateral renal stones with
largest and left upper pole of the kidney measuring 5 mm, no
air in the left kidney, no hydronephrosis, and no
obstruction, and positive hardening artifact.

4. Cardiovascular:  The patient had an echocardiogram
performed due to her murmurs found on exam.  She was found to
have a normal left atrium, and mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection fraction of 70%, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  She was restarted on
her hydralazine, which was increased to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
She is also restarted on her captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.  She
was evaluated repeatedly for tachycardia, and her baseline
was ultimately felt to be in the low 100s.  This responded
well to intravenous fluids, as well as pain medication (Her
Vicodin was restarted).

5. Neurology:  The patient returned to her baseline mental
status at the time of discharge as per her daughter.  A CAT
scan was performed of the head, which was negative for any
acute changes.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Extended care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Urosepsis.
2. Hypernatremia.
3. Hyperglycemia.
4. Tachycardia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q.24h. to be completed on [**5-8**].
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Vicodin 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. prn agitation.
6. Insulin-sliding scale.
7. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9. Metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Senna one tablet p.o. b.i.d. prn.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4844**]
at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**], her pri
