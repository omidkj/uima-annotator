Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion x1

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110101**] is a 67 year old female with history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD, HTN, prior CVA ([**10-17**]),
asthma, DM2 who awoke with acute onset of stabbing chest pain,
shortness of breath, and presyncopal this AM. She had some
associated pain in her bilateral shoulders and throat. The pain
came in three discreet episodes lasting 1.5hrs total, unclear
how long for each episode. She denied any palpitations at the
time and states that she is unable to feel her atrial
fibrillation at baseline. She presents with a detailed medical
record of HR and BPs and appears that baseline HR is 50-60s,
likely sinus (last [**11-22**]).

In the ED, vital signs were T 101.5, BP 149/84, HR 170s
irregular, O2sat 96% on RA. EMS gave 5mg IV lopressor x 2 and
325mg aspirin. In the ED, patient was given metoprolol 10mg IV x
1, metoprolol 25mg PO x 1 in ED with IVF (approx 1.5L), rate
improved to 130-150 with stable BP. However, given that patient
had persistent chest pain decision was to cardiovert patient.
Cardioversion was successful, and patient is now in NSR 60-70s.
BPs 100-110 systolic. CXR unremarkable. Vitals prior to transfer
were 105/53, 60s, 19, 97% 2L.

On arrival to the floor the patient is complaining of chest pain
worse with movement. She no longer has any jaw, shoulder or neck
pain. Breathing is improved.

Studies:
[**12-2**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lungs are clear with no signs of
pneumonia or congestive heart failure. No pleural effusions or
pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable in appearance with the heart appearing top normal in
size. The visualized osseous structures are stable with thoracic
spondylolysis again observed.
FINDINGS: No acute intrathoracic process.

[**12-3**] VQ scan:INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate a small nonsegmental ventilation defect at the right
base on the right posterior oblique image.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show a small matched
nonsegmental defect at the right base. Perfusion is otherwise
normal.
Chest x-ray shows mild hydrostatic edema and patchy bibasilar
opacities.
IMPRESSION: Very low probability for pulmonary embolus.

[**12-3**] CXR:
Portable AP chest radiograph: mild increase in cardiomegaly,
prominent
pulmonary vasculature, perihilar haziness, Kerley B lines are
all findings
suggestive of increased fluid overload. Retrocardiac opacity
likely
represent atelectasis.

[**12-5**] KUB: No evidence of bowel obstruction.

[**12-5**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is
mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110101**] is a 67 year old female with history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD, HTN, prior CVA ([**10-17**]),
asthma, DM2 who awoke with acute onset of stabbing chest pain
and shortness of breath on [**12-2**] and presented to ED.  In the ED
she was found to be in AF with RVR (ventricular rates in the
150s-160s).  They attempted to treat her with beta blockers
without success.  Given persistent chest discomfort the decision
was made to cardiovert her in the ED.  She arrived to the floor
in NSR.

# Rhythm: History of AF on coumadin.  INR on admission was 3.4.
On arrival to the floor the patient was in NSR.  Initially there
was an unclear precipitant for AF - TSH 4.0, CXR without acute
process.  She was maintained on her home dose of Metoprolol 25mg
[**Hospital1 **], titrated up to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and coumadin was continued at 5mg
daily.  Of note, she did have some elevation in CK and troponin
however this was attributed to cardioversion and not felt likely
related to ischemia.  However, on the morning of [**12-4**] she went
back into atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates in the
150s.  She was given IV metoprolol and increased doses of PO
metoprolol without improvement in rate.  She was then started on
a diltiazem gtt, however it was later noted that this is an
allergy for her.  She complained of scratchy throat and was
given IV benadryl and prednisone.  The AM of [**12-4**] rates
persisted in the 150s-160s, BP stable and
