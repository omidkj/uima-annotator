Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
44 year old female with a history of stage V chronic kidney
disease due to focal segmental glomerular sclerosis p/w SOB and
Htn. Ms. [**Known lastname 35962**] was diagnosed w/ kidney disease ~10yrs ago
and has seen a rise in her Cr levels and progression of her
disease over the past few months. A kidney transplant with her
sister as a living donor is scheduled for [**6-30**]. Over the last
week, she has been experiencing headaches and nose bleeds,
feeling tired, confused, and has had some intermittent swelling
of her feet and face, most notably last Sunday. She has been
sleeping with 3-4 pillows and wakes up at night SOB. Yesterday
she went to the movies with her family and became so out of
breath that she "could not talk" which prompted her to come to
the ED. She saw her nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-9**] and her
furosemide dose was raised from 40 to 80mg [**Hospital1 **] but has not had
any change in her medication regimen over the past week and has
been taking her medications regularly. She tries to follow a
low-sodium, kidney-healthy diet but did eat take-out food last
night. She has not noted any decrease in the frequency or
quantity of urination, and denies recent weight change, fevers,
chills, chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, and any change in
bowel movements.

In the ED, her vitals were 98, 179/120, 100, 18, 94%RA. She was
given SL nitro 0.4mg, acetaminophen 650mg, lasix 100IV, zofran,
and started on nitro gtt at 1.5mcg/kg/min, titrated to SBP
130-135. She was transfered to the floor without oxygen and had
an O2 sat of 84% on arrival which improved to the mid-90s with
5L of oxygen.


Past Medical History:
-Stage V CKD due to FSGS, scheduled from kidney transplant on
[**6-30**]
-Hypertension
-Hypercholesterolemia
-Hypothyroidism
-Depression
-Endometriosis
-In-situ melanoma
-Asthma


Social History:
Tob (-), EtOH - a glass of wine 1-2x/month, IVDU (-), lives with
her husband and 9yr old daughter, does not work outside of the
home.


Family History:
No family hx of renal dx. Father w/ triple bypass in his 40s and
DMII, died of accident; mother alive and in good health.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.5 BP:138/89 (134-156/89-98) P: 95 (95-102) R: 28
SaO2: 95%5L
General: Sleeping quietly.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus
noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP
Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated
Pulmonary: Not using acecsory muscles of respiration, crackles
bilaterally to apices. ? decreased breath sounds at both bases.

Cardiac: RRR, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted, JVP elevated to chin at
30 degree angle.
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or
organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Neurologic: A&O x3.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: RRR, mild right axis deviation with mild ST/Twave changes
as compared to EKG from [**2150-4-16**].

CXR [**2150-6-20**]: Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged,
increased since previous exam ([**4-14**]). Moderate interstitial
pulmonary edema, with small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a very small circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology.

IMPRESSION: Very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal
systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction. Increased LVEDP.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 y/o F w/ Stage V CKD with need for initiation of
hemodialysis.

ESRD: Due to FSGS. Initiated on Hemodialysis through right
tunneled line because of hypertension, pericardial effusion,
friction rub, and pleaural effusions with oxygen requirement.
Tolerated initiation of HD well with only some nausea. Had three
full dialysis runs before discharge. Plan for Related donor
renal transplant once condition improves. Sent home on 2L
continuous home Oxygen.

HTN: Likely due to volume overload from ESRD. Started on
labetolol this admission.

Anemia: Chronic, likely due to CKD.

Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine

Depression/Anxiety: Continued home fluoxatine and ativan.
