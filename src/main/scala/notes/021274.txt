Chief Complaint:
Consulted by ED for "ICH"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 This is an 87 year-old woman with a history of HTN, AF with
pacer, who was found by her niece this AM on the floor of her
bathroom.  She was last known well Sunday evening, when her son
(who calls every night) spoke to her by phone.  He was unable to
reach her Monday evening and after failing to reach her this AM,
called his cousin to check in on her.  This cousin gained entry
into her appartment with the help of the local constabulary and
found Ms. [**Known lastname **] lying on her R. side, wedged between the toilet
and bathtub.  She was awake but non-verbal.  She moved her L.
arm with apparent full strength, L. leg with perhaps moderately
decreased strength, and did not move her R. side.  In her
niece's estimation she had been lying immobile for quite a while
-
perhaps > 24h.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transported via EMS to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.  There her
CT head demonstrated a 1x3cm L. basal ganglia hemorrhage without
intraventricular or subarachnoid extension.  At [**Location (un) 8641**] she was
protecting her airway and maintaining consciousness.  However,
because of a hospital protocol mandating intuabation for
particular GCS scores, she was intubated, sedated, and
mediflight trasported to [**Hospital1 18**].

ROS: No known recent symptoms per family.

Past Medical History:
 - AFib with pacer, on coumadin
 - HTN
 - Breast CA, years ago, thought to be in remission


Social History:
The patient lives alone, and is retired.  She is functionally
independent and manages her own medical care and finances.  She
just returned from a solo trip to West Palm beach.

Family History:

OSH CT C-spine:
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment.
NCHCT on admission: (read as hemorrhagic infarct, but more
likely was hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic infacrt)
FINDINGS: There is a 3.2 x 1.1 cm focus of parenchymal
hemorrhage within the left basal ganglia, with surrounding
edema. There is mild mass effect on the adjacent lateral
ventricle. A second focus of parenchymal hemorrhage is seen in
the left occipital lobe which approximately measures 2.2 x 1.6
cm (2:15) with associated edema in a pattern suggesting
cytotoxic edema. There are additional areas of hypodensity in
the left occipital lobe, series 2 image 18, suggestive of acute
infarct. Overall, the findings as described are stable from the
outside hospital CT. There is a large right lateral scalp
subgaleal hematoma. No acute fracture is identified. The mastoid
air cells, the imaged paranasal sinuses are clear. Secretions
are seen in the nasopharynx. An endotracheal and nasogastric
tube are in place. There is coiling of the nasogastric tube in
the oropharynx.
  IMPRESSION:
1. Stable findings of left basal ganglia, and left occipital
parenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema likely related to HTN and
hemorrhagic
infarction.
2. Right lateral scalp subgaleal hematoma.
3. Coiling of OGT in oropharynx. Please correlate clinically

CTA of the head and neck, [**11-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly increased size of the hyperdense hemorrhagic focus,
located
laterally within the left MCA infarct, without evidence of new
hemorrhagic
focus or active contrast extravasation ("spot sign") to suggest
impending
expansion.
2. Stable appearing left PCA infarct with internal hemorrhagic
conversion.
3. Left fetal PCA, which appears patent with increased distal
flow compared
to the right, possibly secondary to recruitment of flow to this
previously
ischemic territory.
4. Patent left MCA with M1 segment uniformly slightly reduced in
caliber
compared to the right but patent-appearing distal branches.
COMMENT: The overall appearance suggests embolism to the left
MCA and (fetal) PCA from a more central, perhaps cardiac source.
N.B. The cervical vessels were not included in this study. If
evaluation of the more proximal carotid and vertebral arteries
is clinically warranted, dedicated neck CTA is recommended.

Echo in ICU:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is considerable
beat-to-beat variabilit
