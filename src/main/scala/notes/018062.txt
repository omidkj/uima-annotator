Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
epistaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right arm AV graft - [**2144-1-29**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]


History of Present Illness:
54F w/ hx of ESRD s/p renal transplant x 3, PE on coumadin
anticoagulation, HTN, hep C p/w epistaxis and elevated
creatinine. Since she has started anticoagulation she has
experienced now 3 nosebleeds. 2 of these bleeds were
approximately 2 weeks ago and short duration (< 10 min) but
today starting at 2PM she experienced a persistent episode of
epistaxis refractory to patient's own attempt at direct
pressure. On presentation to the ED she was found to have INR
elevated to 15.7 and hematocrit decrease of 8 points compared to
[**1-2**]. She otherwise has been well although she does complain of
fatigue over the past several months. She denies any
light-headedness, syncope, fever, chills, chest pain, dyspnea,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or dysuria. She states her
urine output has not decreased acutely over the past several
weeks, and in particulary denies any pain over her renal
transplant. She does have dark stool, but takes iron.
.
Of note she does complain of pain on the plantar surface of her
left foot that is new onset today. She noticed this pain when
she woke up this morning and denies any recent traumatic injury.
She also describes painful "lumps" along the posterior aspect of
her thighs bilaterally.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 99.5 75 102/69 16 100% RA. She was
given 2 units FFP and vitamin K 10mg IV. Renal transplant was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and will see the patient on [**1-21**] during the day. She
was T&C for 2 units, but no blood was given in the ED. She was
noted as a difficult stick but her portacath was being used for
access.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she continued to complain of fatigue,
but otherwise felt well. She does have the pain along the
plantar surface of her left foot where she has a small hematoma.

.
Review of systems:
- negative except as noted in HPI

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
54F w/ hx of renal transplant x 3, recent PE diagnosis on
coumadin, HTN, hep C presented with epistaxis in setting of
supratherapeutic INR, acute on chronic renal failure, admitted
to the ICU for initial monitoring, experienced recurrent
epistaxis on othe floor after re-initiating anticoagulation.
.
Active Issues:
.
# Epistaxis/Supratherapeutic INR:
The patient was found to have epistaxis in setting of elevated
INR to 15.7, found to have eight point hematocrit drop, nadir of
19.5. Anterior packing was done in the ED and on arrival to the
MICU, the patient was no longer bleeding.  She received FFP and
vitamin K in the ED for reversal of her anticoagulation.  While
in the MICU, the patient was transfused 2U PRBC with appropriate
hematocrit response.  Her coumadin was held.  Renal transplant
team felt supratherapeutic INR was most likely due to drug
interactions (coumadin, sirolimus). The packing was kept in for
4 days, and coumadin was re-started with a heparin bridge on day
3 of packing. Clindamycin used for Toxic Shock Syndrome
prophylaxis. She experienced recurrent epistaxis about 36 hrs
after packing was removed, with INR 2.0 and therapeutic PTT,
required 1u pRBC transfusion.  Left nostril was repacked by ENT
on [**1-26**]; right nare was also noted to have bleeding, though ENT
was unable to localize, controlled with surgifoam and afrin.
There were intermittent maroon-colored stools secondary to
epistaxis. On [**1-31**] her L nare packing was removed. Her Hct
remained stable and she had no recurrence of epistaxis.  On
[**2-1**] she was started on IV heparin and restarted on coumadin
2mg daily (of note, IV heparin not started to bridge her to
coumadin, but rather to monitor whether she would have
recurrence of bleeding once anticoagulated).  She did well
without recurrence of bleeding, and on [**2-2**] IV heparin was
stopped.  On day of discharge her INR was 1.3.  She should have
her INR monitored very closely after discharge.  She will be
monitored by the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal failure:
The patient is s/p kidney transplant x3, again with failing
graft.  Most recent creatinine range from 4 to 5 over past
several months, elevated to 8.6 on presentation, though returned
to baseline during hospitalization. Ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis with patent vessels.  The patient's
spironolactone and lasix were held.  She had no signs of uremia
or need for urgent dialysis, though she will likely need to
re-initiate dialysis in the next two months. Transplant surgery
placed AV graft in RUE on [**1-29**].  Nylon stitches to come out at
followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2144-2-20**]. On discharge, he
