Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
Falls, Hypoxia in ER

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 y.o. male with history of smoking, CAD, HTN, DM2,
obesity, who was initially sent from home by VNA due to multiple
falls (s/p rib fxs/humeral fx) and lethargy.  He was recently
discharged from the emergency department after a right humeral
fracture (an oblique fracture through the proximal/mid shaft of
the humerus, + lateral displacement of the distal bony
fragment). In the emergency department, patient was noted to
have decreased oxygen saturations to low 80s, although he denied
any symptoms with this.  The hypoxia would intermittently
correct with supplemental O2 up to 6 liters, but then
subsequently recur.  Patient denies any symptoms such as
exertional dyspnea (walks with walker), orthopnea, PND, or
worsening of lower extremity edema.  He does endorse decreased
sleep latency, falling asleep in less than 5 minutes, and also
questionable daytime hypersomnolence, but denies morning
headaches.  Of note, patient received prescription for Vicodin
upon discharge from ED on [**2173-8-28**].
.
In the ED on this vist, patient received 80mg furosemide, 2
tablets percocet, nebulizers and 60mg prednisone in addition to
supplemental O2.  His O2 Saturation was 92% after this.  ABG
showed compensated hypercarbia, 7.39/57/87.
.
Review of Systems:

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable. There is slight unfolding of the aorta. No focal
pulmonary opacities are identified to indicate pneumonia.
Flowing syndesmophytes are again seen involving the thoracic
spine. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

[**2173-8-30**]
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Focal areas of hypoattenuation
involving the
left posterior temporal lobe and left central sulcus consistent
with
encephalomalacia from prior infarctions appears stable. No new
areas of
hypoattenuation are identified and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation
appears intact. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. Partially aerosolized secretions within both
maxillary antra appear similar when compared to the previous
exam with mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable encephalomalacia of the left posterior
temporal lobe and left central sulcus, indicating areas of
previous infarction. No definite evidenceof new infarction
identified.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
79 yo man with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, obesity, presumpted obstructive sleep apnea
and poor compliance with medical follow-up, with recent
mechanical falls here with dizziness, hypoxia, and lethargy.
.
1. Hypoxia: Though patient appears to have long standing
pulmonary disease, oxygen requirement on transfer appeared to be
new. Patient has improved significantly and appears to be at
baseline. Chest x-ray from [**8-30**] had increased diffuse opacities
along bases consistent with physical exam findings of crackles
upon arrival to floor. Would suspect patient had component of
atelectasis in addition to central hypoventilation. Would also
suspect patient has baseline hypercarbia and oxygen
supplementation with agressive goals resulted in further
decreased respiratory drive. We titrated oxygen supplementation
and started ipratropium inhaler. He was transfused 1 unit of
PRBC and improved very well, likely due to improved oxygen
delivery and improvement of pre-existing pulmonary
vasoconstriction. Patient has continued to refuse non-invasive
positive pressure devices and is aware of importance of being
evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea but declines any workup.
.
2. Multiple falls: Patient initially provided hisotry of
dizziness and weakness which were difficult to confirm during
admission. It appears he has been having disequilibrium and
would benefit from physical therapy.  With recent falls and
prior stroke however, these were concerning for new
cerebrovascular events. Physical exam however remained non-focal
and patient was receiving [**Hospital **] medical therapy for
secondary prevention. Head CT was negative, and MRI head could
not be performed secondary to anxiety and positional arm pain.
We continued aspirin, statin and [**Hospital 4532**]. Patient will require
continuing physical therapy after discharge, will defer decision
to pursue MRI to primary care physician.
.
3. Coronary artery disease/Congestive Heart Failure: Stable
during admission, with low suspicition for pulmonary edema. We
continued home meds of lasix, [**Hospital **], [**Hospital 4532**], metop, lipitor. We
held imdur however due to concerns of orthostatic hypotension
and will defer decision to restart it to primary care physician.
.
4. Diabetes Mellitus type 2: Patient was kept on insulin sliding
scale and was discharged back on oupatient hypoglycemic regimen.
.
5. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Patient presented with baseline
creatinine and continued to be at baseline during admission.
.
6. Anemia - {atient was found to be anemic at admission. Because
of hypoxia and concern for obstructive sleep apnea causing
pulmonary vasoconstriction, patient was trasfused 1 unit of PRBC
with good post trasfusion response. Workup revealed normal TSH,
folate and B12
