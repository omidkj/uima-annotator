Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted from [**Hospital6 5016**] for R foot wet
gangrene on Friday night, [**2180-1-21**]. The pt had an uneventful
transfer, and was continued on IV antibiotics - Vanco, Cipro,
Flagyl. His 4th digit wound probed to bone, was malodorous, and
had seroud drainage. The pt was later taken to the OR for
radical debridement of 3,4,5 toes on Sunday [**2180-1-23**]. The pt
tolerated the procedure well, but following extubation, the pt
desated, and was unable to breath on his own. The pt was then
reintubated and taken to the CVICU. X-ray showed excessive
pleural effusion the Right lung field. The pt was then
bronchioalveolar lavaged, and mucous was removed that grew
yeast. The pt's repeat chest x-ray showed improvement and the pt
was later transferred from the CVICU back to the VICU.
.
The following days, the pt was diuresed and cardiology was
consulted for optimization. The pt then went diagnostic angio of
the Right lower extremity. Unfortunately, intervention was
unable to be preformed, and the pt was scheduled for a later
open bypass. The pt underwent a surface echocardiogram (TTE)
which came back negative for any growhts, and also underwent
vein mappint, which showed adequate Right LE veins. In the mean
time, a wound VAC was placed on the open wound of the right
lateral forefoot. In the meantime, the pt was optimized by
[**Last Name (un) **] & cardiology. Prior to his open bypass, the pt developed
hematuria. Urology was consulted, and preformed a bedside
cystoscopy which showed some bladder stones & Foley Trauma.
.
[**2180-2-1**]: The pt was taken to the Or for Right Fem-PT bypass
graft with Right Greater Saphenous Vein graft. The pt tolerated
the procedure and anesthesia well. Once stable, the pt was
transferred from the PACU to the VICU without incidence. The pt
was kept bedrest throughout the night. He became hypotensive for
a brief episode overnight, and was tranfused 1 unit pRBCs as
well as a 500cc NS fluid bolus. The pt had no other overnight
events.
.
[**2180-2-2**]: The pt had no other overnight events, and was
transitioned from NPO to clears, and then later solids. The pt's
pressures remained in range 95-135 throughout the day. His PT
signal remained dopplerable. The pt's wound VAC was d/c becuase
of pain while it was running. The pt was pre-op 7 consented for
TMA on [**2-3**]. He was again diuresed throughout the day.
.
[**2180-2-3**]: Pt had TMA to the R foot. The pt tolerated the
procedure and anesthesia well without complication. In the PACU,
the pt complained of severe toe (phantom) pain. He was given 8+
mg of IV dilaudid, and eventually required a popliteal block.
The pt was then transferred to the VICU adn dilaudid PCA pump.
.
[**2180-2-4**]: Overnight, the pt remained very lethargic/somnolent. He
was arousable, but very hypotensive. This was attributed to the
amount of narcotic received in the PACU. The pts pressure
stabilized during the day, however it was evident that he was
retaining CO2. The pt was encouraged to use the incentive
spirometer, and was given Neb treatments throughout the day.
.
[**2180-2-5**]:He was out of bed. His nitro drip was d/ced.
.
[**2180-2-6**]:Patient reinstated his DNR/DNI status. Later in the
evening patient became hypoxic and was started on lasix.
[**2180-2-7**]:The patient was intially moved to the CVICU and then
moved back to the floor.
He was also started on a heparin drip and a lasix drip.HIs
cardiac enzymes were negative.He was started on scheduled nebs.
.
[**2180-2-8**]:His chest xray was suggestive of a mucus plug in his
airway. But after discussion with his health care proxy and due
to his DNR/DNI status a bronchoscopy could not be performed.He
was started on chest PT and acetylcysteine.Hospice consult was
called on family's request who recommended extra strength
morning morphine.
.
[**2180-2-9**]:
The patient was made CMO after discussion with his health care
proxy. [**Name (NI) **] was started on a morphine drip and he passed away at
10:20 am.
