Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary artery bypass grafting times four (LIMA>LAD, svg>PDA,
svg>RCA, svg>Diag)[**6-17**]
Mediastinal re-exploration and repair of bleeding side branch of
the left internal mammary artery. [**6-17**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old male with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and polio as a child (with
residual left facial paralysis who presents with dyspnea,
depressed ejection fraction, and an abnormal nuclear stress test
after suffering a cerebral vascular acident in [**Month (only) 116**].

In [**Month (only) 116**] he presented to [**Hospital3 **] with garbled incoherent
speech along with trouble with word finding. He was found to a
non hemorrhagic cerebral vascular accident. His symptoms
resolved within twenty-four hours and he does not have any
residual deficits. He was also found to have a CPK > 5000. His
longstanding Simvastatin was discontinued.  He was also told he
had had a myocardial infarction.

Follow up testing revealed an abnormal nuclear stress revealing
and ejection fraction of 39% and a partial, large, severe
perfusion defect involving the entire inferior wall and the mid
and basal walls. A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed
multi-vessel coronary artery disease and he therefore was
referred for surgical evaluation.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Moderate regional
LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. No atheroma in ascending
aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior,
inferolateral and anterolateral hypokinesis.. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
3--35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. An
epi-aortic scan was performed which showed the ascending aorta
free of atheromatous disease at the clamp and canullation site.

POST BYPASS
There is a small improvement in overall systolic function.
LVEF~40%. There may be improvement of the inferior wall. RV
systolic function remains normal. The study is otherwise
unchanged from the prebypass period.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.




Brief Hospital Course:
On [**6-17**] Mr. [**Known lastname 1169**] was admitted and underwent Coronary artery
bypass grafting x4, with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein
single graft from the aorta to the first diagonal coronary
artery, reversed saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to
the first obtuse marginal coronary artery, and reversed
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the posterior
descending coronary artery.  Please see the operative note for
details.  He was brought to the surgical instensive care unit in
critical but stable condition.  However, in the immediate
post-operative period he developed acute respiratory
insufficiency, hypotension, and excessive bleeding from his
chest tubes.  He returned to the operating room and underwent a
mediastinal exploration for bleeding.  He tolerated this
procedure well.  He extubated by the following day and was
weaned from pressors.  By post-operative day two he was
transferred to the step-down floor.  His chest tubes and wires
were removed per protocol.  He was seen by physical therapy.
His insulin was titrated to maintain a glucose below 150.
Despite his rising CK on zocor pre-operatively, lipitor was
started to protect his grafts.  An e-mail was sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
that his CK be checked in the near future to assess his
tolerance of this drug.  His blood pressure did not allow the
addition of an ACE-inhibitor, but one should be added as his
blood pressure allows in the future secondary to his decreased
ejection fraction and chronic systolic heart failure.  By
post-operative day four he was ready for discharge to home.
Follow-up appointments were advised.
