Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5141**]
Chief Complaint:
Right thoracic pain and productive cough.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. [**6-28**] IVC Optease filter through L common femoral vein by
Interventional Radiology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
2. [**6-29**] R diagnostic thoracentesis by ICU team (Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1370**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
3. [**6-30**] R therapeutic thoracentesis by Interventional
Pulmonology (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3072**])
4. [**7-2**] new Option IVC filter plaved via R internal jugular
vein, inferior to the pre-existing Optease filter by
Interventional Radiology

History of Present Illness:
50-year-old male with a past medical history of extensive
peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p 9 cycles of gemcitabine and
cisplatin (last [**2183-6-20**]), hepatitis C, multiple pulmonary
embolisms with the last while on lovenox, endocarditis who
presents with right thoracic pain and productive cough x several
days.
.
He notes that over the last few days he has developed fatigue,
nausea and vomiting, productive cough with brown sputum,
intermittent fevers and abdominal pain for the last week. He
notes a Tm of 103. This AM he awoke with sharp right sided
pleuritic chest pain. He also noted lightheaded at that time. He
went to [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] for scheduled chemotherapy and was found to have
02 saturation 87-88% on room air with recovery with 2L NC. RLL
revealed diminished breath sounds. Labs were taken which show
WBC 17.5 Hct 25.8 Creat 1.7. At that point admission to the
hospital was recommended however the patient went home for a few
hours prior to presenting to the EW for evaluation.
.
Upon presentation to the EW, inital vitals show T 102.7, HR 121,
BP 143/70, SaO2 87%. At that time he was triggered for altered
mental status. He had bilateral rhonchi R>L. He was noted to be
pale and diaphoretic. He has 2+ edema of right leg. With
supplemental O2 his oxygenation improved as did his mental
status. He received vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl. A CTA
showed large right PE with new cavitation of RLL suggestive of
necrotizing pneumonia. R LE had DVT. He was admitted to medical
ICU for further evaluation and management.
.
Currently, feels much improved.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
He presented in [**2182-11-20**] with constipation and abdominal pain
and was diagnosed with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Pathology of
an  omental biopsy showed adenocarcinoma staining positive for
CK7 and CDX2 and focal weakly positive for CK20, negative for
TTF-1.  Findings were suggestive of pancreaticobiliary or upper
GI tract primary. EGD on [**2182-11-28**] was negative for a primary
source of  adenocarcinoma. His CA19-9 was elevated at 384 U/mL.
Given  these findings, the presentation was most consistent with
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. Mr. [**Known lastname **] began systemic
chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin on [**2182-12-11**]. His first
cycle was complicated by left-sided pneumonia due to MSSA,
Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. He was not neutropenic. Initially
treated outpt with PO abx but then hospitalized for IV
antibiotics. Cycle 2 was given [**Date range (1) 80631**].
.
Past Medical History:
- chronic hepatitis C genotype 3. On [**2182-1-3**], he was started
on combination therapy of pegasys 180 mcg/mL SQ weekly and
ribavirin 1200 mg PO daily. HCV RNA was undetectable at week 4
from a baseline of 261,000 IU/mL. Serum aminotransferases are
normal. Initially, he was tolerating therapy relatively well
except for mood swings, irritability and insomnia and he was
closely monitored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1681**] in Psychiatry. Unfortunately, by
early [**Month (only) **], he had been feeling more depressed with occasional
suicidal ideation and racing thoughts. Apparently, he was
taking twice the prescribed dose of citalopram 20 mg a day; and
he had also relapsed into drinking alcohol; about [**9-17**] drinks
per day for a few days. Given these significant side effects,
pegasys and ribavirin were eventually discontinued.
.
THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSM - CT angiogram on [**2181-7-6**],
demonstrated dilation of the ascending aorta to 4.3 cm- followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
Major depressive disorder
Polysubstance abuse
H/o suicidal ideation
H/o pericarditis, endocarditis, pneumonia

Social History:
History of cigarettes for many years, now quit.  History of
