On arrival to the MICU, patient is calm, comfortable, and
asymptomatic. He confirms the above history and states that

a colostomy bag and ultimately re-anastamosis. He states that 8
years ago he had [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 placed at Ft [**Hospital **] Hospital in
[**State 108**] for an MI (primary symptom chest pain) and had no issues
since then until 5 months ago when he started developing
shortness of breath. He was diagnosed by his cardiologist at

like optimization with another stent placed (unclear type, he

escalating doses of lasix from 20mg PO BID up to 100mg PO BID.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
CXR Portable [**4-16**]: No evidence of acute disease.
EKG [**4-16**]: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left bundle-branch
block. Compared to the previous tracing of the same date there
is no significant change.
.
COLONOSCOPY:
IMPRESSION:  Diverticulosis of the right and left side of colon.
 Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
RECOMMENDATIONS: No blood was seen. The likely etiology of this
patients bleeding was diverticular There were no polyps seen.
F/u with PCP for discussion of further colonoscopy for screening
which would be in ten years.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M history of CAD s/p coronary stenting x 3, CHF, superficial
bladder cancer prior diverticular disease admitted to the MICU
for painless BRBPR and hypotension responsive to fluids.
.
LOWER GI BLEED: Pt admitted to the MICU with 3 total days of
what appears to be LGIB with known diverticula and internal
hemorrhoids, roughly 10 point crit drop from prior baseline, and
transient hypotension to mid-80's systolically in the ED that
responded to small volume IVF bolus. He remained HD stable
without tachycardia (although he was initially beta blocked) or
alteration in mental status.  He underwent colonoscopy by GI
that showed diverticulosis without any active bleeding.  No
polyps were seen.  Follow up with PCP for discussion of further
colonoscopy screening recommended.
.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE/CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART
FAILURE (EF 55%): Patient with significant CAD s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1 on
[**2115-2-6**] on 95% ostial lesion in OM-2 (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Hospital1 **]).
On aspirin and plavix. No chest pain or current SOB. States when
he had his NSTEMI 8 years ago had terrible CP. Clinically is
euvolemic or slightly hypovolemic satting well on RA. He had
ROMI with 3 sets of enzymes and EKG which is unchanged from
baseline (stable LBBB, left axis deviation). He was continued on
his home simvastatin, aspirin 81mg and plavix.
.
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Cr of 2.1 on admission up from baseline of
0.8-1.0 on admission, Cr downtrended to 0.9 on discharge.
Etiology was likely prerenal from hemorrhagic volume loss.
Patient advised to avoid NSAIDs as may worsen renal function and
make recurrent GI bleed likely.

Medications on Admission:
-Enalapril 10mg PO daily
-Tamsulosin 0.4
