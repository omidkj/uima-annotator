Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
L sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV TPA/angiogram

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 81 year old right handed woman hx atrial fibrillation (not
on Coumadin), bilateral CEA, HTN, who presented on [**2138-2-13**] with
left hemiparesis.
    She was last known normal at 2:15pm on [**2138-2-13**]. She and her
husband had just returned home from a restaurant. Her husband
left the room for a few minutes. When he returned at 2:30pm, she
was slumped over in her chair. She was slurring her words and
had
weakness of her left arm and leg. There was no evidence of
trauma.
    The husband called EMS. Per EMS, she had two episodes each
lasting one minute of rhythmic, high amplitude jerking of the
right arm. She did not follow instructions during these
episodes.
No eye deviation, tongue biting, or incontinence during these
episodes.

    Patient was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Stroke code was called at
3:50pm. Stroke fellow was at bedside at 3:55pm.
    Her NIHSS was 16.
NIH SS:
1a. Level of Consciousness: 0
1b. LOC questions: 0
1c. LOC commands:0
2. Best gaze:1
3. Visual: 1 (left hemianopia vs extinction)
4. Facial palsy: 2
5a. Motor arm, left: 3
5b. Motor arm, right:0
6a. Motor leg, left: 3
6b. Motor leg, right: 0
7. Limb ataxia: 0
8. Sensory: 2
9. Best language: 1 ( missed one transition word during
repetition testing)
10. Dysarthria: 1
11. Extinction and inattention: 2 (left visual neglect and left
sensory neglect)

Patient was taken to CT head which showed dense right MCA sign.
No hypodensity appreciated on the right. No loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation.
CTA brain showed intraluminal thrombus of the proximal right M1
artery and the bifurcation of the right ICA.
CT perfusion showed decreased blood volume in the right ACA and
increased MTT in the right ACA.

After Head CT, patient was given 6.1mg of TPA. She received an
infusion of 50mg iv TPA in the ED. She got an additional 10.4mg
of iv TPA in the Angio suite.

Once patient returned to the ED from the CT scanner, she
desaturated. Patient was emergently intubated. Her BP
transiently
increased to 200 systolic. Once she was given Propofol, her SBP
returned to 140-160's.

She was taken to the angio suite at 5:30pm. Conventional
angiogram showed revascularization of the proximal right MCA. No
thrombus was visible. No intra-arterial TPA or MERCI device was
utilized. During the procedure, she was given norephinephrine
prn
and nitroglycerin prn.

It was noted that she had a right femoral hematoma at the site
of
the catheter insertion. The catheter sheath was left in place.
Patient was given frequent groin checks. She also had a small
amount of bleeding from her external ear canals bilaterally.

Patient was admitted to the SICU. STAT Head CT was obtained at
7:50pm. There was no intracranial bleeding.

[**2-13**]: Head: CT/CTA/CTP:
1. Thrombus in the right internal carotid artery at the
bifurcation of the MCA and ACA, and involving the M1 segment of
the right MCA and A1 segment of the right ACA. Both MCA and ACA
demonstrate more distal filling.
2. Evidence of ischemia in the distribution of the right
anterior cerebral artery.

[**2-13**]: CTH: (After TPA) No evidence of hemorrhage after TPA
intravenous infusion.

[**2-14**]: CTH: prelim: no significant hemorrhage/infarction noted on
CTH

[**2-13**]: CXR: 1. The endotracheal tube lies too close to the carina
and can be moved up 2 cm. 2. Moderate CHF.

[**2-14**]: TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.  IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertertension.

MRA head: [**2-15**]:
1. Areas of narrowing in both middle cerebral arteries could be
due to occlusive atherosclerotic disease or due to emboli.
2. Probable partial occlusion of the A2 segment of the left
anterior cerebral artery.
3. Atherosclerotic disease in the posterior circulation as
described above.

MRI brain:: [**2-15**]: 1. Acute left frontal lobe infarct.
2. Small right middle cerebral artery infarcts in the basal
ganglia and right posterior temporal regions.
3. The left-sided infarct has lower ADC value than the
right-sided infarct and could be of more recent origin
