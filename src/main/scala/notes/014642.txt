History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16968**] is a 77 yo RHM with h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM2, HL
who  presented after being found down in front of neighbors
house aphasic and weak on the R side. The patient was feeling
fine on the morning of [**2196-12-24**] other than some minor
nausea. He awoke around 4am, which is usual for him, then
showered and tried to fall back asleep. Around 7am, he awoke
again and ate breakfast. His wife was home, and she saw and
spoke to him off and on throughout the morning, and did not
notice any problems. At 9:30am, he went to walk the dog, which
he typically does 3x/day. At 9:45, his neighbor found him down
and called 911. His wife next saw him in the [**Name (NI) **] Hospital
ED, where she described he was not speaking, only making some
sounds, and the R arm and leg were weak, though he did lift them
up off the bed briefly.

The ED notes describe a NIHSS of 20, with global aphasia and R
facial droop, moving the L side spontaneously, but moving the R
side only occassionally (?posturing) and not withdrawing it to
pain. BP was elevated with SBP 200s. EKG showed NSR. Head CT
showed no hemorrhage and he was given tPA. MRI was also done,
with DWI showing L subcortical restriction and MRA showed
absence
of intracranial L ICA. He was Medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
interventional procedure. En route, BP spiked again to 200s and
tPA was stopped temporarily, nipride was started. On arrival HR
was 69, BP 165/82 on 0.5mcg/kg/hr nipride.
CT/CTA/CTP were performed. NIHSS was 24.

The patients family thinks he seems slightly better now than
before tPA in terms of alertness and trying to communicate.
Later in the ED today, he was answering some yes/no questions
appropriately with his family, and squeezing their hand with his
L hand.

Of note, the family mentions that he has carotid dopplers last
week and one side was 100% occluded. This was a change from a
study 6 months ago which showed 65% occlusion. He was completely
asymptomatic, with no transient neurologic deficits. He did have
hematuria last week, tested negative for UTI.

Not
able to follow simple commands, midline or appendicular.

CN: PERRL 3 to 2mm. Blink to threat is less consistent on R
side.
Eyes have preferential gaze towards L, but can cross midline. R
lower facial weakness.

MOTOR: Normal bulk. Tone is decreased in RUE. Tone is increased
in bilateral LEs.
LUE/LLE move spontaneously and purposefully, antigravity. Not
consistently following commands but squeezes L hand.
RUE/RLE flex slightly to nailbed pressure, does not localize.

SENSATION: likely decreased to pain on R side given lack of
response/grimace.

Reports:
EKG ([**2196-12-24**]): Sinus rhythm. Anterolateral non-specific ST-T
wave abnormality. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CTA Head/Neck ([**2196-12-24**]): 1. Head CT shows no evidence of
hemorrhage. Dense left middle cerebral artery is visualized.
Hypodensities due to small vessel disease and chronic watershed
infarcts are noted.
2. CT perfusion of the head demonstrates large area of cerebral
ischemia
involving the left cerebral hemisphere with small areas of
infarcts in the
watershed distribution.
3. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates occlusion of the left
internal
carotid artery beyond bifurcation with 40-50% stenosis and
calcification of the right carotid bifurcation.
4. Intracranial CTA demonstrates filling defect in the left
middle cerebral artery extending to the inferior division
indicative of a thrombus.
5. Small retention cysts and soft tissue changes are seen in the
visualized sinuses. Degenerative changes are seen in the
cervical spine.

Chest Film ([**2196-12-25**]): Patient is status post median sternotomy
and coronary bypass surgery. Improving right basilar opacity
likely reflects atelectasis. Newly developed linear left basilar
atelectasis is also demonstrated. Calcified pleural plaques are
evident, suggesting prior asbestos exposure.

MR [**First Name (Titles) 11598**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1093**] ([**2196-12-25**]): Somewhat limited study. No signs
of ligamentous disruption or bony injury identified. No evidence
of significant soft tissue trauma seen.  No abnormal signal in
the spinal cord. Degenerative changes most pronounced at C4-5
level where moderate spinal ca
