History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year-old woman with sCHF (EF 45%), CKI
(baseline 1.6-2.3), pAfib and DM presently residing at rehab for
osteoarthritis presents for evaluation of bleeding, which rehab
feels was from vagina notable for recent UTI diagnosed 2 days
ago. The patient was started on levofloxacin 250mg daily 2 days
ago for proteus UTI. Of note, the patient's daughter had called
cardiology RN because patietn was experiencing LE swelling, N/V
and abdominal pain on [**5-10**]. The patient was complaining of
abdominal pain today that was worse in suprapubic area and was
sent to the ED for further evaluation.

  Initial vitals in the ED were 97.6 98 124/70 24 99%. Labs in
the ED were notable for WBC 15.7 94.1%N, HCT 37.9, PLTS 332, INR
2.1, Na 135, K 5.4, HCO3 19, BUN 92, Cr 4.3, Gluc 222 and
lactate 1.8. UA >182 WBC, >182 RBC and pH 8.5. Blood cultures x2
and urine cultures were obatined. Foley placed in the ED drained
2L of blood tinged urine. Patient's blood pressure transiently
fell to SBP of 80s and responded well to 2L NS bolus with SBPs
100s-120s. The patient received Vancomycin 1g IV and Cefepime 2g
IV and was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation. Vitals
on transfer were 98.1 89 101/66 22 99% 4L NC.

On arrival to the MICU, patient appears comfortable and is
without additional complaints.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies sinus tenderness. Denies shortness of breath, cough,
dyspnea or wheezing. Denies constipation, diarrhea, dark or
bloody stools. Denies rashes or skin changes.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2174-5-11**]): The cardiomediastinal and hilar
contours
are stable, with the heart in the upper limits of normal.  The
lungs are well expanded and clear, without consolidation,
pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal

PORTABLE [**Last Name (un) **] X-RAY ([**2174-5-12**]): Supine abdominal radiographs are
limited by motion artifact. No radiopaque renal calculus is
visualized. The bowel gas pattern is nonobstructive. There is no
evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Osseous structures are
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No radiopaque renal calculus
visualized.

cysts.  No renal neoplasm is identified in this non-contrast

Brief Hospital Course:
80F with sCHF (EF 45%), CKI (baseline 1.6-2.3), pAfib and DM
presently residing at rehab for osteoarthritis now admitted for
urosepsis.

# Urosepsis - The patient presented in the setting of N/V and
abdominal pain of several days duration with identification of
proteus UTI at rehab 2 days prior to admission for which
levofloxacin was initiated. On presentation to the ED, the
patient met SIRS criteria given tachycardia to 98, tachypnea to
RR of 28 and a WBC count of 15.7K, which given suspected
urologic infection confers the diagnosis of sepsis. The patient
was transiently hypotensive in the ED with SBP to the 80s that
rapidly corrected to the 100s-120s. Patient remained afebrile.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained in the the ED and given
treatment failure with levofloxacin, the patient was broadended
to vancomycin and cefepime.  It is also likely that underlying
urinary retent
