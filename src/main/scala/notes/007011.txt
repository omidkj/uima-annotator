History of Present Illness:
80 year-old female with past medical history of hypertension but
without known history of CAD, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia
presenting with complaints of SSCP x 3 hours prior to
presentation at [**Hospital3 **].  The chest pressure was
nonradiating and was without any associated symptoms.  ECG
consistent with STE IMI.  The patient received ASA 325 mg,
plavix 600 mg, lopressor 7.5 IV x1, SLN x3, heparin bolus and
gtt.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.
.
Cardia cath results [**2117-4-13**]: CO 4.21, CI 2.55. LMCA: mild
disease, LAD 80% stenosis, LCX 90% serial lesions, RCA 99% with
slow flow -> stented with Vision stent-> 0% residual.   Distal
40% left alone and a small dye stain worrisome for wire
perforation noted.  Stat bedside echocardiogram showed no
evidence of fluid collection or tamponade.  During
catheterization, she received 500 mcg of diltiazem and developed
a transient asystole which resolved without any intervention.
.
The patient previously had three episodes of exertional chest
pressure relieved wtih rest over the past three weeks.  At
baseline, however, she can walk 2 miles without any anginal
symptoms or shortness of breath.

*** Not Signed Out ***

BRIEF HISTORY:   80 year old woman with hypertension presents
with
substernal chest pain for 3 hours to an outside hospital.  EKG
showed
3mm inferior ST elevations.  She was referred to emergent
cardiac
catherization for STEMI.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class IV,  unstable.

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French  [**Doctor Last Name **] 0.75 catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
bare-metal stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

PTCA COMMENTS:    The angiogram showed a mid RCA lesion of 99
percent
with slow flow. We planned to stent this lesion. we used
Heparin,
Aspirin and Clopidogrel prophylactically. A 6F JR 4 guide
provided
adequte support. A ChoICE PT XS wire crossed in to the distal
vessel
easily.     The lesion was predilated with a 2.0 X 20mm Maverick
balloon
at10 atm.   We then deployed a 3.0 X 28 mm vision stent in to
the lesion
at14 atm. The stent was post dilated with a 3.25 X 15 mm
maverick
balloon up to 16 atm. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow
with no
residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no
embolisation.
The patient left the lab in a stable condition.
