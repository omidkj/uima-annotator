Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in the early morning of
[**2143-1-12**] for concerns of respiratory distress and possibly
sternal wound infection/mediastinitis from an OSH.  On arrival,
the the trauma SICU, the patient was afebrile with slight
bradycardia (55bpm) but otherwise stable and respiring well with
an oxygen saturation of 100% on 10L humidified oxygen via trach.
collar.  The inferior aspect of her wound was draining a liquidy
clear yellow fluid which appeared more oily and was without
foul-smell (indeed, was without any odor).  The area appeared
hyperemic but was without any evidence of fluctuation or frank
pus.  A serum WBC count was 12,500 and consistent with those
from the past four days prior to her recent discharge (i.e.
11-12,000).  A Gram stain of the sternal fluid showed 1+ PMNs
but no organisms; culture growth is still pending.  A urinalysis
was consistent with her known UTI (which could possibly be
contributing to her leukocytosis) (for which she is to receive a
further 3 week course of ceftriaxone).  lastly, a CXR showed
some slight volume loss on the left side but appeared improved
on the right with no change in the cardiac silhoutte or
mediastinal contours.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was therefore deemed to be without sternal infection
and stable to return to her rehab facility.  She is to continue
with her 3 week course of vancomycin (for MRSA bacteremia) and
ceftriaxone as previously decided.  She is follow-up with Drs.
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] (Thoracic Surgery) in 2 weeks and [**Doctor Last Name **]
(Interventional Pulmonology) in [**5-17**] weeks.  She is to maintain
her intravenous antibiotics for an additional 3 weeks and keep
her T-tube capped at all times, if possible.  Lastly, a work-up
for her adrenal mass was negative to date for pheochromocytoma
but will be completed as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
(Endocrinology).
