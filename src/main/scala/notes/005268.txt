Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F with h/o CAD, s/p cath 8yr ago, who presents after
developing left sided chest pressure, SOB, diaphoresis ~11AM on
the morning of admission. Pt awoke this morning, and was noted
to be febrile to 101. She was walking to the elevator when she
notes onset of CP as above. She was given 1SL NTG with some
improvement, however her pain was not releived until a second SL
NTG was given in ED.
.
Pt denies recent orthopnea/PND, URI, chest trauma, medication
non-compliance. Of note she had a similar episode 1 week ago,
lasting 2-3 minutes, occured while walking, and resolved after
1SL NTG. A second episode 3hrs later a/w SOB/diaphoresis
prompted presentation to OSH ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3714**]). Per pt's
daughter she has had 3 episodes of CP in past 2-3 weeks.
.
At NWH, EKG with STD in V4-6, ?ruled in by enzymes (trop 0.03,
0.01, 0.15), but pt was started on SESTAMIBI (? in setting of
ACS), however could not complete [**3-4**] inability to give consent,
and decision was made to manage pt's coronary disease medically.

.
.
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with VS=100.6 132 135/69 98%2L. CXR
read as unremarkable. UA clean. Labs revealed cre 1.2 (baseline
0.9 in [**2134**]), WBC 11, and troponin 0.51.
.
Pt was felt to be in afib based on EKG, she was given diltiazem
10mg iv x 1, but no oral load [**3-4**] SBP 100s. Her rate improved,
she had already received asa, and was therefore given plavix
300mg x 1, and started on heparin gtt + bolus.

Pertinent Results:

[**2140-8-8**] 07:20AM   CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-0.63* CK(CPK)-65
[**2140-8-8**] Cardiac Catheterization
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute Non-ST Elevation anterior myocardial infarction,
managed by
medical therapy.
4. Aortoilliac disease.
[**2140-8-7**] ECG:Possible ectopic atrial tachycardia with premature
atrial beats. Left anterior fascicular block. RSR' pattern in
lead V1. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Cannot exclude
ischemia. No previous tracing available for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F h/o CAD, presents with CP/SOB, after similar episodes over
past week.

#Chest pain - Patient was found to have chest pain on
presentation that seemed cardiac in nature.  Was diagnosed wtih
NSTEMI based on ECG changes and troponin elevation.  This was
initially planned for medical management given her high risks
associated with catherization.  However, on [**2140-8-8**], she had
frequent chest pain that required multiple doses of
nitroglycerin wihtout resolution of symptoms.  Again in the
morning of [**8-9**], she had chest pain that required ntg and then
developed pulmonary edema.  Given that she was not tolerating
medical management she was then taken emergently to the cath lab
and found to have severe and unintervenable 3 vessel disease
with significant calcification and thrombus. Surgery reviewed
films and felt that the disease was not amenable to grafting.
Additionally she was started on an integrillin gtt with the plan
to treat for >18 hours with the hope that this will limit
thrombus burden.  Family was made aware of brevity of situation.
Extensive discussions with the family resulted in a change in
code status to DNR/I.
Given the severity of her disease, the difficulty of
intervention and the risks post catherization and prolonged
integrilin, she was taken to the CCU for closer monitoring.

# Pulmonary edema: likely secondary to ongoing cardiac ischemia
and poor LV function acutely.  Initially responded to IV lasix.
Over the 18 hours post-cathaterization, patient became
progressively more tachypnic with worsening crackles on exam
secondary to cardiogenic shock induced by her global heart
ischemia.  Patient subsequently became hypoxic despite 100%NRB
and anuric despite active diuresis attempts with IV lasix.

# Pump - Global ischemia resulted in cardiogenic shock and
respiratory failure.

# Rhythm: Over the evolution of the patient's NSTEMI, she
developed sinus tachycardia, likely an attempt to sustain a poor
CO. As respiratory failure ensued the patient became
progressively bradycardia and finally cardiac arrest.

The patient was pronounced dead at 3:40 am on [**2140-8-10**] from
cardiac arrest.
