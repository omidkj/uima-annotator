Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2111-7-31**] PROCEDURE:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting times one with a
    saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
2. Left-sided Maze procedure with left atrial appendage
    resection.
3. Mitral valve replacement with a 31-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
    mechanical valve, reference number [**Serial Number 82733**].


History of Present Illness:
65 year-old woman with HTN, HL, COPD/asthma, rheumatic heart
disease  who comes with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and
shortness of breath. She was in her prior state of health until
9 days prior to admission when she noted to be very tired, with
worsening shortness of breath. She had seen her PCP 3 days prior
and full evaluation was normal. 7 days ago she noted irregular
palpitations up to 120-130 beats per minute, that worsened her
shortness of breath even further. She recalls taking all her
medications, no changes in her diet, fever, chills, rigors,
diarrhea or signs of infection. Her weight was at her baseline
of 160 lbs. She increased her lasix from 20 to 40 without
improvement in her symptoms. She continued to deteriorate until
[**2111-7-23**] when she was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with Atrial
Fibrillation at 130s and SOB. Her initial BP was 90/60 with HR
130s. She was started on diltiazem infusion, which worsened
hypotension, but controlled atrial fibrillation. She was
admitted to the ICU and eventually she was switched to diltiazem
orally and was started on amiodarone. For unclear reasons she
received steroids, whcih worsened her AFib (per patient's
report). She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac work up
and Cardiac surgery evaluation.

Social History:

She works as administrative assistant.
She currently does not smoke, but quit >30 Y ago; she has h/o 15

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 yo woman s/p cabg/mvr and ct
removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o ptx
COMPARISONS: Chest x-ray from [**2111-8-2**].
FINDINGS:
The right apical pneumothorax is significantly diminished in
size when
compared to [**2111-8-2**] study. No left pneumothorax is
present. A linear opacity in the left mid lung is again
visualized which is the site of previous chest tube placement.
This may represent atelectasis or a small hematoma. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged in appearance.
Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes appear stable. The cardiac
contours and the replaced mitral valve are stable. The bony
structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. The right apical pneumothorax is significantly diminished in
size when
compared to [**2111-8-2**] study.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, stable.
3. A linear opacity at the left mid lung, correstponds to the
site of
previous left chest tube placement, likely atelectasis or
hematoma, unchanged.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
