Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Azithromycin / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11552**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemic respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
ultrafiltration in dialysis lab


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 56 year old female with past medical history
significant for ESRD s/p live donor kidney [**First Name3 (LF) **] in [**2108**]
currently immunosuppressed with tacrolimus/ prednisone/cellcept
who was recently admitted from [**2114-11-8**] to  [**2114-11-28**] at [**Hospital1 1535**] for hypoxic
respiratory failure and ARDS requiring intubation which was
thought to be precipated by a pneumonia.  Her hospital course
was complicated by acute kidney injury which was back to
baseline prior to [**Hospital1 **] and severe deconditioning due to
prolonged intubation for which she was discharged to St [**Hospital **]
Hospital Rehabilitation Unit - [**Location (un) 8117**], NH
on [**2114-11-28**].
.
She is reported to be doing well since [**Date Range **].  She was
discharged from rehab to home two days ago.  She went to her
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] yesterday.  She complained off
feeling cold yesterday night and was not able to sleep that
night.  This morning she felt well and had yogurt and some other
stuff for breakfast.  After few hours she felt cold and some
shakes.  She was shallow breathing more than her baseline per
daughter and thus led them to go to [**Name (NI) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she was
noted to have pneumonia on CXR and intubated [**1-2**] to respiratory
distress. EKG showed nonspecific ST-T changes and she was given
levofloxacin,  vancomycin and flagyl along with 2 DS Bactrim
tabs for potential PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was never hypotensive and was not
started on pressors.
.
She was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where vital signs were 98 101/58
66 20 100% on vent (CPAP 90% FiO2 PEEP of 10). ABG showed
7.30/25/116/15. CXR consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Renal
US was obtained which was concerning for early rejection vs ATN.
 She was transferred to MICU for futher evaluation and
management.
.
In the MICU, she was intubated and sedated but followed command
and was alert to her surroundings.

alcohol, though she used to abuse alcohol. No IVDU. While in
[**Country **], she lived on a farm for 3 years-- exposure to many
domestic farm animals. She does not recall any skin rashes or
febrile illnesses during that period. She does not know if she

.
CXR ([**2114-12-5**]): Mild pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly.
Confluent opacity at the right lung base, can not exclude
pneumonia.
.
Renal US ([**2114-12-5**]): Lack of diastolic flow in the mid and lower
pole intrarenal arteries.  Findings raise concern for acute
tubular necrosis or tranplant rejection.  Patent main renal
vein. Close clinical followup recommended.
.
TTE ([**2114-12-10**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CT Head ([**2114-12-11**])
No acute intracranial process. Note that CT has limited
sensitivity for the detection of acute infarction, and MR/DWI
can be obtained as clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 59031**] is a 56y/o lady with past medical history significant
for ESRD s/p live donor kidney [**Name14 (STitle) **] in [**2108**] who was
immunosuppressed with tacrolimus/ prednisone/cellcept admitted
with one day history of acute respiratory distress requiring
intubation with infiltrates on CXR concerning for multifocal
pneumonia.  No organism grew; imaging was suggestive of diffuse
alveolar hemorrhage.  She required ultrafiltration in order to
be extubated.  She was weaned to room air and was breathing
comfortably.  The etiology of her respiratory distress is
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] immunosuppressive regimen was decreased in case
infection precipitated her decompensation, and she will have
outpatient follow-up with Pulmonology.  She was discharged home.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: With b/l infiltrate on CXR and
her history slightly suggestive of aspiration, ddx included
aspiration pna vs atypical bacterial pna vs viral pna vs PCP vs
MRSA or other hospital acquired pneumonia as she has had a long
hospital stay recently.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed bronchoscopy, all
cultures, stains and count along with fungal, viral and CMV
culture
