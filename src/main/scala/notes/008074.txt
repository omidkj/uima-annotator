History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old male with history of HLD,
Hypertension, and MI (medically managed 15 years ago), who
presented to an outside hospital with chest discomfort. Pt
states he awoke not feeling well with discomfort the morning of
[**8-12**]. At that time he thought it was secondary to indigestion
and describes a substernal pain rated at [**2136-3-22**]. Pt denies any
radiation of that pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, or shortness
of breath. Pt went to work and while driving developed some
dizziness which reguired him to pull over. When he returned home
his wife encouraged him to go to the doctor and had a friend who
is a nurse check his blood pressure which was found to be
160/90. At that time patient went to the ED. Throughout this
entire time pt states pain increased in severity.
.
At [**Hospital 7145**] hospital he was given SL NTG, maalox, prtonix on
arrival. EKG showed sinus with rate of 73, ST elevation in II,
III, aVF with TWI in V5,V6. Stable LAFB. Cardiac enzymes
initially trop 0.3, CK 116, then on 2nd set troponin 5.43, CK
440. He was given plavix 300mg on the morning of [**8-13**], one inch
nitropaste, lopressor 25mg q6. At that time he was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
In the CCU, pt is hemodynamically stable. With resolution of his
chest pain with no nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain or diaphoresis.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence, dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope.

[**2135-8-13**] Cardiac Cath:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Sucessful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of a thrombotic
occlusion
at the mid RCA with two overlapping DESs.
3. Unsuccessful POBA to the mid-distal RPDA for an embolic
occlusion.

[**2135-8-15**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary
muscle dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old male with history of HLD,
Hypertension, and MI (medically managed 15 years ago), who
presented to OSH after 6 hours of chest discomfort.  He had
evidence of an inferior STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to
the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have
complete occlusion of the mid RCA treated with 2 overlapping
DES.  His RPDA was unable to be opened up despite several
attempts.

1) RCA STEMI - treated with two drug eluting stents.  He was
transferred directly to the cardiac catheterization lab where he
was found to have 100% MID occlusion of the RCA sp successful
overlapping DES x2 to mid RCA with possible embolization of
thrombus in distal RPDA.  At the end of the catheterization he
had persistent occlusion of the RPDA despite multiple meds/ptca.
 He did well post catheterization with no complications.  His CK
peaked at 995 post catheterization.  His post PCA echocardiogram
showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally and his LVEF =
50 %.  He also has [**1-21**]+ MR felt to be likely due to papillary
muscle dysfunction post MI.  He is being discharged on plavix
75mg daily, ASA 325mg daily.  His home verapamil was
discontinued and he was started on metoprolol and a low dose of
lisinopril.  He was also treated with atorvastatin 80mg which
can be changed back to his home dose of 40mg on discharge as his
lipid panel shows very good control.  He will follow up with his
outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**].

2. Hypertension - his outpatient hypertension regimen was
changed during his admission.  His verapamil was discontinued
and he was changed to metoprolol and lisinopril which were
titrated for blood pressure control prior to discharge.

3. Asthma:  He was continued on his home regimen of advair,
spiriva, albuterol and ipratropium.

4. Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: Stable.  He was continued on
Flomax.

5. History of 3.5cm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: unclear current
status, no acute issues during this admission.  He will need to
follow up with his PCP post discharge to determine appropriate
monitoring.

6. Lower extremity swelling - recently started on furosemide as
an outpatient.  This was held during this admission and on
discharge in order to maximize room for metoprolol and
lisinopril titration as his
