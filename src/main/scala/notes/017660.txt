Final Report
SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST DATED [**2200-6-30**]

HISTORY: 66-year-old woman with shortness of breath; assess for
pneumonia.

FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "erect" with
excessive
lordotic positioning, is compared with semi-upright study dated
[**2200-4-27**]. There
is more marked cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion
and blurring,
indicative of interstitial edema, as well as right greater than
left pleural
effusions. There is no overt alveolar edema or focal
consolidation. Airspace
opacity at the right lung base likely represents a combination
of atelectasis
and effusion; pneumonic consolidation at this site cannot be
excluded.

IMPRESSION: CHF with right effusion and right basilar
atelectasis,
significantly worse since [**2200-4-27**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 35914**] was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and
treated for a severe COPD flare and acute on chronic diastolic
heart failure. She was treated with albuterol, atrovent, O2,
Bipap, steroids. She rapidly improved after the inital 24 hours.
Thereafter, advair and spiriva were restarted. Plan to complete
5 day course of levofloxacin. Patient is currently full code as
discussed with her friend and health care proxy is her friend
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1456**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 98823**].

Lasix dose was increased to 40 mg (20 mg is the home dose) wih
good diuresis and improvement.

She was transiently hypotensive in ER and responded to fluids.
Slowly home meds were reintroduced. At discharge the dose of
hydralazine is lower than the home dose with a normal BP. Her
home regimen is lisinopril 40mg daily, hydral 50mg tid and
norvasc 10mg daily.

Leukocytosis: trended downward with treatment of COPD. Abnormal
differential was noted. Please refer above. Defer to PCP to
recheck and follow up.

Schizophrenia/dementia: on resperidone, aricept. The dose of
fluoxetine is conflicting. Refer below. There is a discrepancy
between the dose of fluoxetine at home and that the pharmacy
told us. she was given 40 mg here til the dose was confirmed
with proxy. Discharge dose is 80 mg daily - which is the dose
she was discharged on last time from our hospital and what [**Doctor First Name **]
told us patient was on at home prior to this admission.
