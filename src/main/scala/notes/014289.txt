Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old male
prisoner who was involved in a fight in prison and was
apparently assaulted by multiple people with a question of
loss of consciousness.  He was initially taken to [**Hospital **]
Hospital where he was found to be somewhat disoriented.  A
chest x-ray at that institution demonstrated a left
pneumothorax.  The patient at the time was saturating 100%;
however, he was intubated at [**Hospital **] Hospital for combative
behavior.  He had a left chest tube placed at that time.
Other injuries noted at the [**Hospital **] Hospital were left knee
swelling and the patient at that hospital also underwent a
CAT scan of the head which was reportedly negative for acute
intracranial pathology.  The patient also underwent a CT of
the chest at the [**Hospital **] Hospital which showed multiple
left-sided rib fractures and a left pulmonary contusion
associated with those fractures.  At that time, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]
for further workup and evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Multivitamin.
2.  Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Upon transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient's blood pressure
in the Trauma Bay was 142/palpable, heart rate 67.  The
patient was intubated, saturating 100% on his ventilator
settings which were SIMV 700 by 14 with 100% FI02 and 5 of
PEEP.  On examination, he was intubated and sedated, moving
all extremities.  His pupils were reactive and equal.  He was
noted to have a right forehead lac just above the eyelid.
The midface was stable without evidence of unstable
fractures.  He had a C-collar in place.  The patient's
tympanic membranes were free of blood.  His chest was clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  He had obvious crepitus
throughout his thorax.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm
with a normal S1 and S2.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, did
not appear to be tender.  Back:  The examination of the back
showed no step-off or deformity.  Extremities:  The left knee
was somewhat swollen and his left foot was somewhat mottled
in appearance.  Ankle brachial indexes were measured in the
Trauma Bay and his ABI was 1 on that left side.  There were
no other obvious deformities on examination.  Neurologic:
Somewhat limited by the fact that he was intubated and
sedated; however, he was moving all extremities.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 23.3, hematocrit
37.2, platelets 264,000.  The patient's coagulation studies
were normal.  His U/A showed trace blood with 0-2 RBCs on the
microscopic examination.  Chemistries revealed a sodium of
140, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 151.  His amylase was 80.  His tox
screen was negative.  His ABG on arrival was 7.30, 53, 151,
27, and 0.  He had a lactate of 1.8.

The patient, as previously mentioned, from the outside
hospital had a CT of the head which was negative for fracture
or intracranial hemorrhage.  CT of his chest showed multiple
left-sided rib fractures and a left pulmonary contusion as
well as a left-sided pneumothorax.  CT of the abdomen was
reportedly negative.

The patient had a CT of the C-spine as well which was
negative.

At the [**Hospital3 **], he had a left knee x-ray which was
negative for fracture.  However, there was a question of a
right medial femoral condyle avulsion fracture.

The patient did not have a chest tube placed at the outside
hospital.  He was noted on the chest x-ray in the Trauma Bay
here, at [**Hospital6 256**], to have a
pneumothorax.  He had a left-sided chest tube placed in the
Trauma Bay at [**Hospital6 256**].  The
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
further treatment and monitoring.

Over the next several days the patient remained on the
ventilator.  During his hospital stay at [**Hospital6 1760**], he was slowly weaned to
minimal support on the ventilator.  The patient's hematocrit
was noted to trend down during the first several days of his
hospital stay.  The patient received a total of 4 units of
packed cells and transfusion.  He underwent CT angiogram of
the chest as well as a CT of the abdomen and pelvis while at
the [**Hospital1 **] which showed no active sites of
bleeding in the chest.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis was
unremarkable.  The patient also received a CT scan of the
thoracic and lumbar spine which showed a transverse process
fracture of the fourth lumbar vertebra.

Orthopedics was consulted during his hospital stay, both for
his left medial femoral condyle avulsion fracture as well as
to evaluate the left knee.  They also saw the patient and
consulted on this fourth lumbar vertebral fracture.  The
vertebral fracture was found to be amenable to nonoperative
management and essentially required only symptomatic
management with pain control.

The left knee was placed in a knee immobilizer and they
recommended toe-touch weightbearing when the patient was
ambulating.  The patient will ultimately require an MRI of
the left knee to further evaluate it but that was not
obtained during this hospitalization.  Of note, on the
patient's follow-up chest CT, it was noted that the patient
had a persistent moderate size pneumothorax on the left side
despite the presence of a chest tube.  Because of this, the
patient had a second left chest tube placed in the ICU and
his lung was noted to be fully expanded after placement of
that chest tube.  Both chest tubes remain in at the time of
this dictation and they remain on suction.  The remainder of
the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course is fairly unremarkable.  The
patient did have several fevers during his hospital stay.
Multiple cultures of the blood, sputum, and urine were
initially negative and remained essentially negative at the
time of this dictation.  The patient was started on tube
feeds and the patient was receiving tube feeds at a goal rate
of 90 via a NG tube at the time of this dictation.

The patient was placed on vancomycin and Levaquin.
Vancomycin was subsequently discontinued.  At the time of
this dictation, the patient remains on Levaquin for
prophylaxis of possible pneumonia; however, there is no
culture date to support that.

The patient also underwent follow-up CT of the head on the
day of his discharge from this institution.  The results of
which are pending at the time of this dictation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
2.  Subcutaneous heparin.
3.  Pepcid.
4.  P.r.n. morphine.
5.  P.r.n. Ativan.
6.  Levaquin.
7.  Tylenol.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post assault with left pneumothorax, status post
left chest tube placement times two.
2.  Left medial femoral condyle fracture as well as a T4
transverse process fracture.

DISPOSITION:  The patient remains intubated on minimal
ventilator support, most likely will be able to be weaned off
the ventilator in the next several days.  Currently, the
patient is on day number six of a course of Levaquin and can
be continued for a ten day course and then discontinue.
