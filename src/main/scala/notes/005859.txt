Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
LE edema, cold/blue feet, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27320**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with h/o CAD, CHF (EF 25%),
HTN, HLD, DM, afib, PVD, CVA, who presents with bilateral leg
edema and hypotension.
.
Patient was seen today by [**Age over 90 269**] and was referred to ED for concern
of worsening b/l LE edema and cold, blue toes. Recent telephone
notes in OMR note worsening LE edema. Patient has not been
adherent with leg elevation and does not allow her legs to be
wrapped or to wear compression stockings. Recently increased
Torsemide dose from 10mg to 25mg daily at Cardiologist
appointment 3 weeks ago. No dietary indiscretions, taking all
meds.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 63 89/54 18 95%. Exam notable
for ulcerations on both shins, weeping, and marked bilateral
pitting edema of the lower extremities. Patient was evaluated by
Vascular given concern for cold, blue toes - patient had no
signs of ischemia and +dopplerable pulses in bilateral lower
extremities, so consult was cancelled by Vascular. SBP dropped
to 78, improved to 90s with 500cc IVF. Labs notable for Lactate
4.2 -> 3.3, Cr 1.2. CXR showed L sided pleural effusion and
pulmonary edema. LENIs negative for DVT. Patient was given
Vanc/Zosyn for possible PNA. Vitals prior to transfer: 97.9 65
92/67 19 98%2LNC
.
On the floor, the patient is currently comfortable. No pain in
her legs, but notes that they have been increasingly swollen in
the past few weeks. No fevers, chills, cough. No shortness of
breath, lightheadedness, palpitations, chest pain.

Studies:
CXR [**12-25**]
Increased left pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. Left lung
opacity most likely represents atelectasis, although an early
developing
infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. Recommend repeat
radiographs after
diuresis to rule out underlying infectious process.
.
LENI [**12-25**]
No evidence of DVT. Peroneal veins not well visualized on this
study. Significant soft tissue edema.
.
ECHO: Bedside [**12-26**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-8-18**],
LVEF is slightly increased (may be due to lack of tachycardia
now) (the LVEF was OVERestimated on the prior).

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27320**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with h/o CAD (s/p MI, BMS
placed in LAD [**6-24**]), CHF (EF 25% in [**8-24**]), DM, HTN, HLD, s/p
CVA, who is admitted with worsening b/l LE edema, hypotension
concerning for CHF exacerbation.
.
#. Hypotension/CHF exacerbation: Patient with SBP 70-80s in the
ED, baseline per last d/c summary is SBP 80-90s. Patient
appeared grossly fluid overloaded on exam and CXR, weight up 7kg
from 2 months prior, so hypotension may be related to poor
forward flow from acute on chronic congestive heart failure.
