Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
sternal wound infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2175-6-7**] sternal debridement/rem. wires/VAC placement
[**2175-6-9**] sternal plating and closure


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 62 yo F s/p CABGx2 [**2175-4-3**] (LIMA to diag, Vein to OM)
which was complicated by a pseudomonal sternal wound infection.
She initially returned on [**4-7**] with ongoing low grade fevers and
"pustular bloody drainage" from the lower border of her sternal
wound.  At this time, she was started on vancomycin.  However
her
wound continued to have copious purulent drainage
which was swabbed on [**4-11**] and returned with a pan sensitive
pseudomonas. Her wound was opened and debrided and noted to
extend fairly deep. ID was consulted and recommended IV cipro in
addition to the vancomycin. As her wound cultures were performed
while pt was on vanco, it was uncertain if any component of her
sternal wound infection was due to a gram positive organism. Her
[**4-13**] Chest CT w/o contrast showed up to a 6mm dehiscence of the
upper sternum with a small, gas-containing retrosternal
collection.  A wound vac placed but no further debridement was
performed at that time. She was discharged on [**4-20**] with a plan
for 6 weeks of IV antibiotics. She was seen in ID f/u on [**5-8**] at
which time she continued to have a wound vac in place and due to
persistently elevated inflammatory markers, it was decided to
continue her abx until seen by Cardiothoracic Surgery on [**5-22**] at
which time her wound vac was discontinued. It was finally
determined by ID that her IV vancomycin and PO cipro would be
completed on [**5-29**].

She was seen today in the [**Hospital **] clinic on routine follow-up where
she was noted to have "black/green drainage" requiring dressing
changes twice daily. She notes the discharge began to increase
1-2 weeks ago and appeared "like meat juice". She has also noted
the top of her sternal wound developing increasing erythema over
the last few days with some erythema extending into her R.
breast. She has also noted an increase in right pleuritic chest
pain over the past week and now has an element of constant pain
through the respiratory cycle.  She denies any ongoing fevers,
shakes or chills. She notes her sternal wound has been healing
well despite the ongoing drainage. However, she does state that
she is aware of some degree of instability, especially in the
upper portion of the incision. She notes a clicking sound when
making certain twisting movements or with use of her arms.  At a
scheduled visit to the [**Hospital **] clinic today a new area of drainage at
the midpoint of the sternal wound was noted, raising concern for
a recurrence of infection.  She was referred to the ED by the ID
physicians for chest CT and evaluation by CT surgery.

Pertinent Results:
IMPRESSION:

1. Progression of bone resorption at the site of median
sternotomy. The
sternal wires remain intact. Findings are concerning for
continued
dehiscence. Infection may be present.

2. Retrosternal fluid collection. [**Month (only) 116**] be postoperative seroma,
though
infection cannot be excluded based on imaging.

3. Right pleural-based nodular opacity may represent a focus of
inflammation.
Previously described pulmonary nodules appear stable.

4. Right breast nodule, stable. Correlation with mammography is
recommended.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted from ER on [**6-6**] for further mgmt. Evaluated by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (plastics). IV abx started with ID recs.
Taken to OR for sternal debridemewnt/wire.rem./VAC placement on
[**6-7**], and the subsequently on [**6-9**] for sternal plating/ closure.
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition. Extubated
[**6-10**].Went into A Fib  and trated with diltiazem and amiodarone.
Transferred to the floor on POD #[**1-5**] to begin increasing her
activity level. PICC is in place for IV abx therapy for 6 weeks
with vanco/cefepime. She has f/u scheduled with plastic [**Doctor First Name **],
cardiac [**Doctor First Name **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (ID). 12-lead EKG should be done
daily to monitor QTc while on amiodarone. Labs per discharge
sheet to be drawn this Friday [**6-16**]. Vanco trough level should be
done after every 4th dose. JP drain to stay in place until seen
by plastic [**Doctor First Name **]. Heparin SQ stopped today as she is a Jehovah's
Witness and is currently on plavix. She should be ambulated
frequently at rehab to help decrease risk of DVT. Additional
meds have been added for tighter glucose management with new
fixed dose and SSI attached. Cleared for discharge to [**Location (un) 582**] at
[**Hospital 5176**] rehab on POD #[**3-7**].
