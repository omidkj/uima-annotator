History of Present Illness:
56 y/o male patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with HTN, hypercholesterolemia,
DM2, current smoking, PVD s/p Left CEA and totally occluded
[**Country **], with chest discomfort begining three weeks ago which he
describes as "stressed out feeing" right before the holidays.
Denies pain or associated symptomes of SOB, diasphoresis, light
headedness, nausea, or leg swelling. He has been chest dicomfort
free for the last several weeks since then, with the exception
of increased SOB, mostly at night, and increased leg swelling,
cough, and PND.
He presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39934**] office with SOB, cough, and
sputum production, was treated with antibiotics with no
resolution of symptomes, and had a CXR suggestive of pulm edema,
and so was referred to NEBH ambulatory services for evaluation.
He was admitted to NEBH for r/o MI, troponins 1.82 to 4.16 to
5.35 with CK 173 to 161 to 181. Started on asa, plavix, lovenox
and transferred for possible cath/CABG given rising troponins.
Denies chest pain currently. Denies SOB.

Pertinent Results:
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
NSTEMI, low EF, 30 beats of monomorphic VT

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 6 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Left Ventriculography: was performed in the 30 degrees [**Doctor Last Name **]
projection,
using 33 ml of contrast injected at 11 ml/sec, through the
angled
pigtail catheter.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system.
There was no angiographically apparent CAD in the LMCA. The LAD
had a
long diffusely diseased segment with a 70% stenosis. The LCX had
a 70%
proximal stenosis. The OM had a 95% origin stenosis. There was
moderate
diffuse distal disease in the LCx. The RCA had a 50% mid vessel
stenosis
and 95% bifurcation disease at the PDA and PL.
2. Hemodynamics on entry showed elevated filling pressures, mild
to
moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a normal cardiac output.
There was
no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.
3. Left ventriculography showed a dilated ventricle which was
globally
hypokinetic.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

3. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.

change over wire and d/c CTs
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
PTX
CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM

History of CABG and increasing dyspnea with CV line change.

Status post CABG. Right jugular CV line is in the SVC. No
pneumothorax. The right costophrenic region is not included on
the film. There is opacity at the left base obscuring the left
hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis in the left lower lobe
and associated small left pleural effusion. Status post cervical
spine fusion.
