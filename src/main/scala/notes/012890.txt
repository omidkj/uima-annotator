Service:  CCU/CARDIOVASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit after a decreased hematocrit likely in the setting of
aspirin and Plavix after catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral
vascular disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 and a prior
history of gastrointestinal bleed [**2134-9-6**] with an INR of
20 at the time admitted for elective catheterization after
positive stress test.  Catheterization was done with stent to
the obtuse marginal two and proximal left circumflex with an
LVEF of 46%.  The patient was maintained on a heparin drip,
Plavix, aspirin, Integrilin drip post catheterization with an
a.m. hematocrit of 27.8, repeat at 26.4, previously prior to
admission was 40.3.  The patient was hemodynamically stable,
but had two episodes of dark bowel movements with bright red
blood per rectum times two.  The patient was nasogastric
lavaged with bright red blood, which cleared with 200 cc of
nasal saline wash.  The patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit where a GI consult was consulted
and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, but showed no active
bleeding.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was unable to visualize
the fundus secondary to clot at the time.  After the initial
esophagogastroduodenoscopy the patient was transferred to the
floor, but had a low blood pressure in the 90s and a repeat
hematocrit of 25.  The patient was again transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring with q 4 hour
hematocrit checks.  The patient's hematocrit was stable in
the 30s after 5 units of packed red blood cells total.  A
repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, which showed 3 to
4 erythematous spots consistent with nasogastric tube
erosions less likely arteriovenous malformation.  The patient
had no active bleeding at the time when transferred to the
Cardiac Medicine Floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Peripheral vascular disease status post right metatarsal
amputation.  Status post right femoral popliteal bypass.
Status post left below the knee amputation.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an EF of 46%.
3.  Coronary artery disease.  Catheterization on [**2136-12-25**] revealed three vessel disease, left main with an osteal
40% lesion, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery
to 50 to 60% lesion, mid left anterior descending coronary
artery 50% lesion, proximal left circumflex 95%, 70% obtuse
marginal two, total occlusion proximal right coronary artery
with collaterals and an elevated left sided right sided
pressures status post two stents to the proximal left
circumflex and obtuse marginal two.  EF of 46%.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
7.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.  Heart rate 65.  Blood
pressure 136/55.  Respiratory rate 28.  Satting 99% on room
air.  In general, this is an comfortable, conversant,
friendly male in no acute distress.  HEENT oropharynx is
clear.  Sclera anicteric.  Oropharynx is clear.  No blood.
Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round and

summation gallop.  Extremities status post left below the
knee amputation.  Right lower extremity dressing clean, dry

PERTINENT DATA:  White blood cell count 12.4, hematocrit
stable at 31.1, INR 1.1, potassium 4.2, creatinine 1.0,
magnesium 1.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient
had no clear localization of the bleed despite bright red
blood per rectum and melena.  The patient underwent
nasogastric lavage with 200 cc of blood, however, endoscopy
times two during hospitalization stay revealed no acute
source of bleed.  The patient was transfused to a hematocrit
greater then 30 and had stable post transfusion of 5 units,
hematocrit around 33.  The patient was maintained on
intravenous PPI initially and transitioned to po PPI.  The
patient was avoided starring aspirin or Plavix, however,
after his hematocrit stabilized and no localizaton was found
and the patient was stable without any further signs of
bleeding, aspirin and Plavix were restarted.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient is status post
catheterization, stable without chest pain.  The patient was
subsequently started on aspirin and Plavix as stated above,
maintained on statin.  Metoprolol was started after no
evidence of bleeding and titrated to a goal SBP.  The patient
was also started on an ace inhibitor on discharge.

3.  Pump:  The patient had an EF of 46%.  No evidence of
decompensated congestive heart failure on examination.  The
patient was maintained euvolemic during this hospitalization
stay and after load reduced with an ace inhibitor
reinitiation on the day of discharge.

4.  Rhythm:  The patient was in atrial fibrillation
throughout the hospital course.  The patient was maintained
on Digoxin for rate control as well as beta blocker.  The
patient was not started on Coumadin given his question
gastrointestinal bleed and will likely follow up with an
outpatient cardiologist for further reinitiation of Coumadin.

5.  Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was started on po and
tolerated well.  The patient was maintained on Glargine at
his home dose and a Humalog sliding scale to cover.

6.  Peripheral vascular disease status post right foot
ulcers:  Stable.  The patient was maintained on wet to dry
dressing changes t.i.d.  Vascular surgery followed this
patient in house and did acute wound management.  The patient
is to follow up with his vascular surgeon as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable heart rate and blood pressure.
No further signs of bleeding.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post stent placement.
2.  Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to Integrilin.
