Chief Complaint:
 hyperkalemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old woman with pmh significant for ESRD
secondary to IgA nephropathy, on HD, awoke this morning feeling
shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, and reported feeling
crackles in her chest. She reports these symptoms are consistent
with her being hyperkalemic, as she has experienced these in the
past. She called EMS, on arrival her HR was in the 20's. EKG had
peaked T waves. She was given 1 amp of calcium chloride by EMS.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED her HR was 36. Initial potassium was 9.9
on a hemolyzed sample. She was given an amp of sodium
bicarbonate, dextrose, albuterol, and insulin. Her HR increased
to 80's. Renal saw the patient and wanted admission to the ICU
for urgent HD.
.

In the ICU, she reports feeling rather diaphoretic and not well.
Notably, on FSBG check her BS is 60. She reports last HD session
was [**10-1**]. She did have some non-bloody emesis this am which is
new and has had some URI symptoms recently, though no myalgias,
fevers, chills or sweats. She denies any consumption of foods
high in potassium other than potatoes over the weekend. She has
been taking all medications as directed.

Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: first diagnosed in [**Month (only) **]
[**2195**]. She has not been on Coumadin until very recently due to
history of upper GI bleeding. On [**Month (only) 404**] of this year, she was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and shortness of breath in the

setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and
hyperkalemia. She was treated for hyperkalemia and subsequently

her atrial flutter was converted to sinus rhythm. Myocardial
infarction was [**Hospital1 20003**] out based EKG and biomarkers. Thereafter,
she underwent right-sided isthmus ablation of clockwise atrial
flutter, and was started on quinidine and Coumadin.
2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to IgA
nephropathy. She underwent cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2173**]
which has eventually failed, and started on hemodialysis in
[**2193**].
3. History of upper GI bleeding on [**2195-2-20**] with evidence
of esophagitis, gastric ulcer, and bleeding duodenal vessel. She

was treated by clipping, cauterization and PPI. Repeated
endoscopy in [**2195-4-21**] revealed mild inflammation and healing
ulcer. She has not had any recurrent episodes of GI bleeding
since then.
4. Diastolic heart failure supported by an echocardiography from

[**2195-12-21**]. Clinically, she is stable and fairly asymptomatic

on her current medical regimen.
5. History of malignant hypertension, which was complicated by
seizure on [**2193-5-20**]. Not on antiepileptic meds. Denies h/o CVA.

6. Depression.
7. Rheumatic fever in childhood
.

rarely drinks alcohol, and denies illicit drug use. She used to

No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or

sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory. Her father
died at the age of 80. Her mother died at the age of 64 from
lung CA. She has a sister with breast CA. MI in uncle in his 60s

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is a 62 yo female with history of ESRD
on HD who presents with hyperkalemia of unclear etiology with
ECG changes but otherwise hemodynamically stable admitted to
MICU for urgent HD.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Potassium of 7.7 on presentation to ED. Unclear
etiology given recent HD, no dietary indiscretions, normal acid
base status and no other metabolic abnormalities. Pt was
urgently dialyzed in the MICU. Recheck potassium 4 hours after
HD was 4.0. She was sent home with a prescription for
kayexelate.
.
# Hypoglycemia: Pt found to be hypoglycemic upon admission to
the ICU. This was felt to likely be related to insulin she
received in ED for her hyperkalemia, [**1-22**] amp D50 given c good
result.
.
# HTN: BP currently stable. Continued outpateint regimen of
lopressor (switched to tartrate while hospitalized) and
lisinopril. Captopril held overnight, however, pt was more
hypertensive overnight. Pt discharged on home dose of
amlodipine.
.
#Afib: continued on amniodarone
.
# GERD: continued pantoprazole
.
# Depression: continued citalopram
.
# FEN: No IVF, HD for electrolyte balance, Renal Diet

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a high potassium level. It is not clear
what resulted in this potassium elevation. High potassium can
cause arrythmias so you were admitted to the hospital for
emergency dialysis. After dialysis your potassium was just a
