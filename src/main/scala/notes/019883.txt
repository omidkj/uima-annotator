Studies:
CT head [**2-20**]: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or
acute major vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter
differentiation appears well preserved. There is moderate
atrophy which appears disproportionate to age with ex vacuo
dilatation of the ventricular system. Atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted within the anterior and posterior
circulations. Soft tissues and globes appear unremarkable. No
osseous abnormalities are noted. There are large probable mucus
retention cysts noted within the left frontal sinuses and right
maxillary sinus with mucosal thickening noted within the left
maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells.
.
CXR [**2-20**]: Bibasilar atelectasis with bilateral pleural
effusions, appearing loculated on the right side. Cardiomegaly.
.
TTE [**2-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
ABI [**3-5**]:  Normal arterial study of the lower extremity arterial
system at rest.
.
MRI brain [**3-5**]:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or definite diffusion-weighted
abnormality to suggest ischemia.
2. MR angiography through the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] shows
irregularity of the distal branches of the middle cerebral
arteries bilaterally, which may represent atherosclerotic
disease, although vasculitis is also a diagnostic consideration.
3. Multiple foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality in
the periventricular white matter along with age-inappropriate
brain atrophy may reflect marked small vessel ischemic changes.
4. Marked sinus disease most prominent in the left frontal,
bilateral sphenoid and right greater than left maxillary sinuses
may represent acute sinusitis. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

Swallow Evaluation [**3-4**]:
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Signs of aspiration were noted with thin liquid, and the patient
had significant retention of solid consistencies in his pharynx.
He appears safest on nectar-thick liquids and puree consistency
solids, with supervision. He appears at risk to choke on solids
due to his impulsiveness, and his diet probably cannot be
advanced unless his mental status improves.

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 4, mild-moderate dysphagia.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. PO diet of nectar-thick liquids and puree consistency solids.

2. Pills can be given whole with nectar-thick liquid or in
puree.

3. Strict 1:1 supervision with all POs. Pt appears at choking
risk and aspiration risk due to his mental status.

4. Please check mouth after giving pills and POs to ensure pt is
not pocketing solids, and suction if needed.

5. Aspiration precautions, including seating pt as upright as
possible, before and for 30 minutes following meals.

6. We will follow up later this week to advance the pt's diet if
appropriate.
