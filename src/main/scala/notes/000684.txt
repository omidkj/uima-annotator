Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Bactrim / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
elective admit for gyn procedure, transfered for acute renal
failure from gyn service, volume assessment


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- elective operative ablation of vulvar and anal dysplastic
lesions on [**4-30**]
- continuous renal replacement therapy
- paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
46 year old woman with CVID, h/o lymphoma s/p CHOP,
granulomatous hepatitis with portal hypertension, primary
pulmonary hypertension and
refractory HPV related vulvo-/anal disease admitted to the
hospital for elective operative ablation of vulvar and anal
dysplastic lesions on [**4-30**].  She maintained a baseline Creatinine
baseline in the range of 0.7-1.1 until very recently.
.
Her postoperative Creatinine was noted to be increased to 2.2
and
peaked at 3.5 on [**5-2**].  Her potassium levels have also
intermittently increased to 6.0, but are currently down after
Kayexalate.
.
The Surgery itself was uncomplicated and was conducted under
general anesthesia.  She remained hemodynamically stable and
other than a single blood pressure drop to 70's systolic and few
readings in the 90's systolic, there were no major hypotensive
events.  She received about 300 ml LR and no colloids or blood
products.  The EBL was 3 ml.  She received e-Aminocaproic acid
before the case as a prophylaxis for her bleeding disorder,
while her Lasix, Spironolactone and Nadolol were held.
.
She has been transfered to the West ICU team due to concern of
renal failure and difficult to monitor fluid status in the
setting of pulmonary HTN. On day of transfer she had a
therapeutic paracentesis of 1L.  She received 200cc of 25%
albumin.
.
On [**5-2**], UOP was 20-45 cc/hr, on 1-2L oxygen, BPs 90-106/60-76.
This morning, UOP was 0-40 cc/hr for 233 UOP in 11 hours.  She
has had 30 cc/2hr of UOP after arival on the floor.
.
Patient states she states that she had one problem with renal
failure in the past but it resolved on its own (in the setting
of pneumonia). She denied CP but reports some mild dyspnea which
had been worsening since her surgery on [**4-30**]. She stated that her
abdomen was much distended from baseline but better than it was
before the paracentesis the morning of MICU transfer.

Imaging:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2205-5-13**] 8:42 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-4**], the monitoring and
support
devices have been removed. Blunting of the left costophrenic
angle
posteriorly could reflect pleural effusion or pleural scarring.
Low lung
volumes most likely account for the prominence of the transverse
diameter of the heart. No acute focal pneumonia or vascular
congestion.
.
MRI of head limited study -52 REDUCED SERVICES Study Date of
[**2205-5-11**] 5:51 PM
FINDINGS: This is a non-diagnostic and incomplete examination,
the axial
images demonstrate significant motion, however high-signal
intensity is
visualized in both basal ganglia, suggesting changes due to
hepatic
encephalopathy. A trace of high signal intensity is demonstrated
on FLAIR on the right insular region (image 12, 13, 14, series
#7), suggesting possible proteinaceous material versus
subarachnoid hemorrhage, please consider repeat examinati
