Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**10-12**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78yo W with a history
of CKD, COPD, 55 pack year smoking history, Alzheimer's
dementia,
atrial fibrillation (not anticoagulated), hypertension, history
of right ICA occlusion and previous SAH who is transferred from
an OSH for an intracranial hemorrhage.

At baseline, we know that Ms. [**Known lastname 66736**] is described to be quite
"weak", and has been sleeping more lately. She enjoys watching
TV, is able to maintain some conversation and her language
function is mostly normal. She does have difficulty with short
term memory. She is mostly functional with her ADLs, lives at
home with her husband, and depends on her husband for her
medications. Lately, she has been missing some of her
medications, and her son describes that she has been more
"sleepy" lately.

At approximately 5pm this evening, the patient was riding in her
husband's car to [**Holiday **] dinner and acutely started to moan
incoherently for a few seconds, and then started to blankly
stare. She started to froth from her mouth. Her husband thought
initially that her oxygen tank wasn't working properly, but it
was working just fine. He called EMS, and the patient was taken
to an outside hospital where she was noted to be "aphasic and
not
moving her right side". She had one episode of vomitting, and
out
of concern for airway protection, she was electively intubated.
She had a head CT that showed evidence of a 7cm IPH with midline
shift and concern for an underlying mass. There is a significant
SAH component, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a higher
level of care.

She was med flighted here, and was noted to be initially
hypertensive to the 170s systolic on arrival, and then started
on
propofol which brought her pressures down to the 140s. Propofol
was held for my examination.


Past Medical History:
- Chronic kidney disease with baseline Cr 1.2
- Atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation), rate controlled
- Hypertension complicated by hypertensive encephalopathy
- History of SAH (see d/c summary from [**2113**])
- Right ICA occlusion thought to be chronic
- Alzheimer's dementia
- COPD on home oxygen


Social History:
55 pack year smoking history, baseline
functioning as above. No EtOH or illicit drugs.

Family History:
Mother died from aneurysmal rupture in 50s,
father died of prostate cancer in 70s.

noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy

Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic Examination (off propofol x 10 minutes):
- There are some spontaneous movements of the left arm
- She does not follow commands, track objects.
- Her eyes are open spontaneously, but with a prominent left
ptosis
- Pupils are reactive and equal bilaterally (5-3mm)
- Corneal and VOR reflex are absent
- Good gag/cough, and facial grimace is grossly symmetric
- She does not overbreathe the vent.
- LUE localizes to pain, LLE triple flexes to pain
- RUE just twitches to painful stimuli, RLE does flex slightly
to
pain
- Toes are up bilaterally, reflexes are symmetric and present
throughout

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF DEATH at 9:00am on [**10-14**]
GEN: elderly woman lying in bed, pale skin, not moving
HEENT: pupils fixed and dilated
CV: no hearbeat auscultated or palpated
PULM: no respirations auscultated or palpated
EXT: cool, not moving

DISCHARGE LABS:

Did not obtain as pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] at time of death

IMAGING: CT HEAD [**2119-10-12**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, left frontal, parietal and
temporal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and bilateral intraventricular
hemorrhage with effacement of the left ventricle and rightward
shift of normally midline
structures.
2. Right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] dilation is concerning for early
ventricular
entrapment and obstructive hydrocephalus.
3. Early tonsillar herniation appears to be present.

CTA [**2119-10-13**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Massive left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
extensive
vasogenic edema and approximately 7 mm of rightward shift of
midline
structures.
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern,
interpeduncular fossa,
sylvian fissures, and perimesencephalic cisterns.
Intraventricular blood
products in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
3. No evidence of aneurysm or other vascular anomaly.
4. Chronically occluded proximal right internal carotid artery
with a small amount of reconstituted flow manifest as a string
sign, unchanged from [**2114-3-5**].


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78yo W with a history of CKD, COPD, 55 pack year
smoking history, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation (not
anticoagulated), hypertension, history of right ICA occlusion
and previous SAH who ws transferred from an OSH for an
intracranial hemorrhage. Her NCHCT done here showed worsening of
her IPH, and  extension to 9x8cm over 19 slices with a
significant subarachnoid component and intraventricular
component that raiseed the possibility of an aneurysmal bleed,
particularly given that there is a family history of
catastrophic aneurysmal rupture and death, although most likely
etiology was amyloid angiopathy.  Her prognosis was poor given
the extent of her hemorrhage.  CTA was done that showed no
vessel abnormalities that led to the bleed, and pt was made [**Year (4 digits) 3225**]
on [**10-13**].  Palliative care was consulted, and they recommended
morphine, ativan, zofran, zyprexa and hyoscyamine PRN
discomfort, all of which were started.  Pt died peacefully on
[**10-14**] at 9am.
