Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Inferior wall MI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
82 year old male with history of DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital 67277**]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of
acute inferior wall MI.  The patient says that on the morning of
admission, he woke up at midnight with shortness of breath which
was worse on laying down and prevented him from sleeping.  He
additionally noted a dull chest pain, as well as pain in his
cervical spine.  The pain was [**9-13**] in severity and continuous
throughout the night. There was no associated presyncope,
palpitations, or diaphoresis.  He presented to his primary care
physician in the AM, and was directed to go to the ER after an
EKG reportedly with atiral flutter.

On arrival to OSH ED, his vitals were P 116, BP 118/76, R 16.
An EKG at that time reportedly showed rapid AF.  He was given
multiple doses of IV lopressor without much change in HR.  He
was given SL nitro for his chest pain with decrease in BP to
83/59.  Given the persistence of his chest pain he underwent CTA
which was negative for dissection.  1st set of cardiac enzymes
were negative.  BNP was 71.  A repeat EKG later in the afternoon
demonstrated prominent ST elevation in the inferior leads.  He
was started on a heparin drip and given a plavix load and ASA,
and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was arranged.
.
In the cath lab he was found to have a dominant LCx with an
ulcerated 90% distal lesion prior to the bifurcation of the PLBR
and PDA that was stented with a drug eluting cypher stent.
Aortography did not demonstrate a dissection.  His right and
left sided filling pressures were both noted to be elevated,
with a PCWP of 37, and PA 47/29.  His CI was found to be 1.5,
and he was started on dobutamine at the conclusion of the cath.
His BP was consistently > 100 systolic throughout, with HR
intermittently 110-120.  He was brought to the CCU on a
dobutamine drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.

C. Cath. [**2135-7-7**]
COMMENTS:
1.
2.Resting hemodyanmics revealed elavted right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 25mmHg and pulmonary cappilary wedge
pressure of
37mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic
hypertension with
PASP of 47 mmHg. The Cardiac index was reduced at 1.5 L/min/m2.
3.Successful primary PCI of the LCx with a 3.0 x 18 Cypher DES.
Final
angiography showed TIMI III flow, no dissection, no
embolizationa and no
peforation.
4. Asceding aortography revealed no evidenc of dissection. The
descending aorta appeared moderately dilated.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by primary PCI
of the
LCx vessel.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram, [**2135-7-9**]:
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: *<= 25% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2135-7-8**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Severe global LV
hypokinesis. Severely
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. RV function depressed.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
severely depressed.
2, The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-7-8**],
the LV is
better visualized, and LV function is clearly reduced on this
study.
.
EKG [**2135-7-7**]
Irregular supraventricular tachycardia, possibly multifocal
atrial tachycardia. Incomplete right bundle-branch block.
Inferior ST segment elevations suggestive of an acute inferior
wall myocardial infarction. Non-diagnostic T wave flattening in
the precordial leads. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
Transesophageal Echocardiogram [**2135-7-11**]:
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was monitored by a nurse
in [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated
for the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information section). Local anesthesia was provided by
of the echocardiographic results by e-mail.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are complex (>4mm, mobile) atheroma in the aortic
arch and descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation.

IMPRESSION: No intraatrial thrombi identified. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.

EGD [**2135-7-11**]
Findings: Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Localized mild erythema of the mucosa was noted in the
gastroesophageal junction. These findings are compatible with
mild esophagitis.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Localized discontinuous erosions and erythema of the
mucosa were noted in the antrum. These findings are compatible
with gastritis with erosions.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Other
findings: Brunner's gland hypertrophy
Impression: Mild erythema in the gastroesophageal junction
compatible with mild esophagitis
Erosions and erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis
with erosions
Brunner's gland hypertrophy
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Okay to use full anticoagulation. Give PPI [**Hospital1 **],
check H. pylori
