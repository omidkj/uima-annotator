Pertinent Results:
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-7-27**]
9:05 AM

HISTORY: 61-year-old male with large stroke, evaluate for
bleeding.

COMPARISON: [**7-25**] and [**2195-7-24**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained
without IV
contrast.

FINDINGS: A large left MCA territorial infarct is similar in
appearance to
the prior study, without evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
No
significant mass effect is identified, without shift of normally
midline
structures. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are most
compatible
with chronic small vessel ischmemic changes. A more confluent
hypodensity
within the right parietal lobe is unchanged, and likely reflects
a more
chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and some volume loss with
ex vacuo
dilatation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. The ventricular
system is
stable in size and configuration, without evidence of new
hydrocephalus. The
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
Atherosclerotic
calcifications of the cavernous carotid and vertebral arteries
are seen
bilaterally. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of large left MCA territorial
infarct, without
evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 M w/ hx St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical Ao valve, on
coumadin, (though found subtherapeutic), recently found down at
home R hemiparetic and aphasic, taken to OSH where NCHCT
revealed large L-MCA infarct, started on mannitol and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

1. Left MCA infarct: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have a large L MCA
infarct, suspected to be secondary to having a mechanical aortic
valve, and being subtherapeutic on Coumadin.  He was started on
mannitol prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  He had serial head CTs
which showed a stable large infarct, and the mannitol was
tapered off, discontinued on [**7-29**].  With his stable head CTs,
without signs of hemorrhagic conversion, he was started on
Coumadin on [**7-29**], which he should continue with a goal INR of
2.0-2.5.  He had an A1C of 5.4% and an LDL of 82.  Exam on
discharge was notable for a fluent aphasia.  He is able to state
high frequency phrases, but also will say non-sensical words,
and is perseverative, with inability to reliably follow
commands.  He is able to move all extremities, but does not
cooperate with full strength testing.

2. Hypertension.  After allowing autoregulation of BPs, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was restarted on lisinopril, with a goal SBP of <140.

3. Bradycardia.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is consistently in sinus bradycardia,
generally from 40-50 bpms.  His 12-lead EKG is normal, and this
may simply be a consequence of his stroke.

4. FEN:  The patient was evaluated by speech and swallow, with a
video swallow, which raised concern for possible silent
aspiration.  He had a G-tube placed on [**7-29**], but should continue
to work with speech and swallow to work on improvement of his
abilities.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital **] Hospital of [**Location (un) **] and Islands

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Left MCA stroke

Secondary: Mechanical aortic valve


Discharge Condition:
Fluent aphasia.  Frequent use of high frequency phrases, and
occasional non-sensical words, however exihibits poor
comprehension, unable to follow commands.  Able to lift all
extremities anti-gravity


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for right sided weakness and speech
difficulties.  You were found to have a large left sided stroke.
 This was likely secondary to not being therapeutic on your
Coumadin.  The Coumadin can now be restarted, with a goal INR of
[**12-22**].5.

If you notice new headache, worsening weakness, or other
concerning symptoms, please return to the nearest ED for further
evaluation.

Followup Instructions:
You have the following follow-up appointment:
