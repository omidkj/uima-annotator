HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old G4, P2,
who has a history of dysfunctional uterine bleeding which was
refractory to medications and endometrial ablation who is
seen for planned vaginal hysterectomy, anterior/posterior
colporrhaphy, and left salpingo-oophorectomy for both
dysfunctional uterine bleeding and left ovarian cyst.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pulmonary embolus in [**2130**], on Coumadin
since.

Hypertension.

Congestive heart failure.

Pulmonary hypertension.

Morbid obesity.

Sleep apnea.

Restrictive lung disease.

Positive PPD.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST OB HISTORY:  G4, P2.

PAST GYN HISTORY:  Irregular vaginal bleeding since [**2140**].  No
history of blood transfusions or STDs.  Last normal mammogram
is [**11/2136**], last normal Pap smear was [**11-28**].  The patient had a
previous Thermachoice endometrial ablation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco, alcohol or
drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  Heparin agents.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed.
2. Coumadin 7.5 mg on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and 10 mg on
   the other days.
3. Ferrous gluconate tablets.
4. Megace.
5. Flexeril.
6. Folic acid.
7. Beclomethasone.
8. Synthroid 112 mcg q.d.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day 0, the patient underwent a
total vaginal hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy for
dysfunctional uterine bleeding.  The procedure was
significant for difficulty placing IV lines preoperatively
with failed A-line and placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter in
the right internal jugular, 1200 cc of blood loss, 2 units of
packed red blood cells transfused, a fibroid uterus, and a
large left ovarian cyst, which ruptured serous fluid, normal
right ovary, and anterior and posterior repair were not
performed.  Please see operative note dictation for further
details.

POSTOPERATIVE COURSE:  Postop day 0, the patient remained
intubated postoperatively and brought to the medical ICU
overnight for monitoring and continued intubation given the
patient's morbid obesity and 3-hour surgery in a
Trendelenburg position.  She remained hemodynamically stable
overnight and was extubated on postoperative day 1 without
difficulty.  On postoperative day 1, she was started on
liquid and solid diet.  Her pain was well tolerated on p.o.
pain medications.  She could not ambulate; however, had
pneumoboots placed for DVT prophylaxis.  She had electrolytes
checked and replaced as needed, and her Lasix was held due to
low blood pressures.  The patient's hematocrit was 28.5 and
after the 2 units 32.3.  The remainder of her hospital course
is discussed in systems:

Pulmonary.  By postoperative day 1, the patient was extubated
and at her pulmonary baseline with O2 supplementation needed
for exertion.  The patient is on home O2 as well.  The
patient's Lasix was held until postoperative day 3 given her
borderline blood pressure; however, her blood pressure on
postoperative day 3 was 120/70, and the patient was restarted
on her Lasix p.o.  A chest x-ray performed to evaluate line
placement showed normal chest x-ray, just mild evidence of
fluid overload.  On discharge, the patient was saturating
well on room air and at her baseline.

Cardiovascular.  The patient remained cardiovascularly
stable.  She had some mild tachycardia, which was resolving
prior to discharge, likely secondary to her mild anemia.  She
had an episode of chest pain on postop day 3 that was not
felt to be cardiac with a normal EKG when compared to her
prior EKG and partial resolution with Maalox.

Heme.  The patient had been receiving a heparin alternative
for the 4 days prior to her surgery under the direction of
her hematologist.  Postoperatively, she was started on her
regular Coumadin regimen by postop day 1, and her INR was
followed.  On the day of discharge, her INR was 1.5, and plan
was made to have it checked in 2 days at home with visiting
nurse.  She was kept on pneumoboots throughout her
hospitalization for DVT prophylaxis, and she had no signs or
symptoms of clinical pulmonary embolus while in the hospital.
Her hematocrit was 32.5 after her 2 units of blood
postoperatively and was unstable at 29 prior to discharge.

Endocrine.  The patient was continued on her thyroid
medicine.

Postop.  The patient was ambulating by postoperative day 2.
Her Foley was also discontinued on postoperative day 2.  She
was tolerating a regular diet with good pain control with
p.o. pain medications and had no evidence of vaginal
bleeding.

ID.  The patient had no signs or symptoms of infection;
however, did receive ampicillin, gentamicin, Flagyl for 48
hours postoperatively as prophylaxis.

Hypertension.  The patient had history of hypertension per
report; however, had normal to low blood pressures throughout
her admission and did not require any antihypertensives.

Line.  The patient had a right internal jugular line
replaced, Swan-Ganz catheter, which was removed on postop day
1, and a central line was placed.  This was removed on the
day of discharge on postoperative day 3.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Dysfunctional uterine bleeding status
post total vaginal hysterectomy and left salpingo-
oophorectomy, with pathology pending.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 94042**]
in 2 weeks and will have followup blood draws in 48 hours, to
be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for her medical conditions.
