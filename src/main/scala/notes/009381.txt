Chief Complaint:
chest pain

History of Present Illness:
59 year old gentleman with a past medical history of CAD s/p
CABG in [**2151**] with LIMA to LAD and RIMA to RCA, hyperlipidemia,
htn, and smoking. The patient was having symptoms of shortness
of breath and chest pain, unclear for how long and decided to go
to his PCP who he had not seen in over two years. On route to
the office, his symptoms worsened and he called his doctor who
advised him to pull over and call 911. Taken by Ambulance to
[**Hospital1 **] ER at 1130. There he received 325 aspirin, 4 morphine
and nitroglycerin drip. Arixtra (Fondiparinux) was also given.
EKG revealed ST depressions in leads I, aVL, V3-V6. ST elevation
in AVR. CK 99, MB and troponin unknown. The patient had worsened
dyspnea and hypoxia, had pulmonary edema on CXR and was
electively intubated (etomidate, succinylcholine). Integrilin
started and sent for catheterization. Left heart cath via right
femoral artery reportedly with 95% lm occlusion, native RCA and
LAD are both occluded. LIMA and RIMA appeared patent.
.
Pt received 40 IV lasix and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
intervention. Became hypotensive to SBP 70-80 and was placed on
neo gtt on route. On arrival to cath lab pt still pressor
dependent. Cath revealed critical >95 percent stenosis at L main
near junction of LCx and ramus. Bare metal stent placed. SBP
improved after placement of this stent and pt weaned off
pressor.
.
Also of note, pt had traumatic intubation. In addition, at first
Foley could not be placed--abd was getting distended. Foley
placed by urology after dilation of ureteral meatus (had some
meatal stenosis).
Pt currently intubated and sedated, unable to provide history
and does open eyes and seems to respond to voice.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-3-12**] 6:33 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Please assess for ETT position and for pulmonary edema.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with CHF, intubated for pulmonary edema.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please assess for ETT position and for pulmonary edema.
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW CHEST:

REASON FOR EXAM: Assess for pulmonary edema, patient post CABG.

COMPARISON: None.

ETT tip projects 6.4 cm above the carina and the tip is out of
view below the diaphragm. There is moderate pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis. The bases were not
included on the film. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the left main
pulmonary artery.
.
Cardiac Catheterization: COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
critical left main disease. The LMCA had a 95% stenosis
involving the
ostium of the LCX and the ramus. The LCX had moderate diffuse
disease
and the LAD was totally occluded proximally and filled via the
LIMA. The
RCA was not engaged.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left

sided filling pressures with an RA of 20 and a PCWP of 24. The
cardiac
index was reduced at 1.9 L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LMCA involving teh LCX
and ramus
origins with two 3.0 x 18 mm VISION BMS in a kissing style.
Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stents, no
dossection
and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock as evidenced by acidosis, hypotension
requiring
pressors and low cardiac output
3. Successful stenting of the LM into the LCX and the ramus with
BMS.
.
ECG:
Ectopic atrial bradycardia. Extensive inferolateral ST-T wave
changes. Consider myocardial injury/ischemia. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2151-12-24**] the rhythm is now ectopic atrial
bradycardia and the inferolateral ST-T wave changes are new.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

.
Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG admitted with MI, with
heart failure and cardiogenic shock now status post PCI to 95%
lesion at LMCA at LCx and ramus origin.
.
#) CAD/Ischemia: Reports 1.5 weeks of CP before reporting to
OSH. s/p CABG in the past, now s/p BMS X2 in a kissing style to
LMCA at LCX and Ramus origins to open 95% lesion. He completed a
course of integrillin, and was continued on aspirin,
clopidogrel, atorvastatin, lisinopril.  Metoprolol was initially
held because the patient was bradycardic after his myocardial
infarction and intervention. Metoprolol was eventually added on
hospital day #3 once his heart rate increased. He was initially
continued on isosorbide dinitrate, but this was discontinued
prior to discharge.  The patient remained chest pain free for
the duration of his hospitalization.
.
#) Heart failure: Patient was in cardiogenic shock at
presentation and in cath lab. On arrival to the CCU the patient
was no longer in cardiogenic shock. His PA catheter was showing
borderline pulmonary hypertension, and a wedge of 16.  ECHO on
hospital day #2 showed EF 70%, and unable to determine focal
wall motion because of po
