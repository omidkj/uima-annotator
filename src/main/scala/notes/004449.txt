Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening fatigue.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left mini thoracotomy, placement of 2 epicardial LV leads and

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62yo male with ischemic
cardiomyopathy who is followed closely at the heart failure
clinic @ [**Hospital1 18**]. Over the last year, patient has noticed
progressive fatigue and lack of energy, which is beginning to
interfere with his day-to-day activities. He has no shortness of

and he remains completely independent with his routine ADL's.
He
has no stamina and feels that this has definitely gotten worse.
In [**2156-12-4**], he underwent failed attempt for biventricular
lead placement due to anatomy. He is now referred for surgical
placment of epicardial LV lead.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: No AR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
The patient is having a limited left thoracotomy to place a
venticulary pacing lead s/p CABG.

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
There is a dilated cardiomyopathy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 10 - 15 %). with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2157-1-21**]
where the patient underwent a left mini thoracotomy, placement
of 2 epicardial LV leads and repositioning of biventricular
pacer/defibrillator. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  On POD 1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery on POD
2.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  He was
started on colchicine and given a cane for a complaint of left
knee pain and a uric acid level of 8.  His pain improved with
this regimen.  By the time of discharge on POD three the patient
was ambulating with cane assistance, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics and colchicine.  The
patient was discharged to home with VNA services in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
