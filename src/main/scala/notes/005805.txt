Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Attempt at lumbar puncture on [**2114-8-10**]
-Hemodialysis (Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday)
-Removed left internal jugular hemodialysis catheter (tunneled)
- [**2114-8-17**]
-Replaced tunneled hemodialysis catheter [**2114-8-20**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89279**] is an 80yo female with ESRD on hemodialysis [**2-19**]
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral vascular
disease, coronary artery disease who was admitted to the MICU
for fever and altered mental status. Per the patient's sister,
her baseline mental status is interactive, able to feed herself,
and walk ~18 steps.  Her mental status on admission is minimally
reactive to painful stimulus.  The patient has not complained of
fevers, SOB, headaches, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea. No recent
seizures noted, although sister has apparently been titrating
patient's dilantin "to somnolence" at home.
.
In the ED, her vitals were T 104.1, HR 72, BP 144/103, RR 20,
and 100% on RA. Her labs showed leukocytosis with left shift, UA
was positive although urine culture later came back negative.
Her lactate was 2.0. She was given Vancomycin/Zosyn empirically.
She remained stable in the ED and was admitted to MICU for
monitoring.

Past Medical History:
1. Multiple admissions for toxic metabolic encephalopathy-
extensively worked up with MRI, EEG, and neurologic
consultations.  These episodes are typically secondary to
infections, missed [**Month/Day (2) 2286**] sessions or other metabolic
derrangements, and are quite profound clinically.
2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
3. Coronary artery disease
4. Peripheral vascular disease
5. Hypertension
6. Pulmonary hypertension
7. h/o subdural hematoma and intracrnial hemorrhage in [**9-25**]
8. Toxic Multinodular Goiter
9. Chronic kidney disease on HD (left arm fistula infected [**6-25**]
requiring aneurysm repair, now getting hemodyal
10. Lumbar disc disease
11. Osteoarthritis
12. Anemia - low iron and EPO
13. s/p Breast biopsy
14. s/p Hysterectomy
15. s/p excision of a left ear mass
16. s/p transmetatarsal amputation (right foot)


Social History:
-Resident of [**Hospital3 537**] since [**2114-6-14**],
-Sister very involved in her care, and is the HCP.
A-t baseline, patient ambulated with walker, could feed herself
and interact with family.
-Sister and daughter deny tobacco, alcohol.

CT abdomen/pelvis
1. No intra-abdominal source for infection identified with no
evidence of abscess or colitis.
2. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid with cholelithiasis. No
associated inflammation of the gallbladder or gallbladder wall
edema to suggest acute cholecystitis. This can be further
correlated with dedicated ultrasound as clinically indicated.
3. Mild inflammatory changes about the anus compatible with
proctitis.

Upper Extremity Doppler (Left)
1. New nonocclusive thrombus within the left internal jugular
vein.
2. Cephalic vein not clearly visualized. Remaining veins remain
patent.
.
CT HEAD [**8-11**]: Slight prominence of subdural spaces at the
convexity is more prominent than the previous studies. This
could be related to differences in angulation of the scans, but
a followup study would help to confirm the stability. Brain
atrophy is again identified. The MICU was informed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
CT HEAD [**8-12**]: Unchanged from yesterday

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89279**] is an 80F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, who
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-10**] with fevers, leukocytosis,
dilantin toxicity and altered mental status.
.
Fever - Initially the source of fever was unclear. LP was
attempted but unsuccessful and patient's family declined further
attempts to LP. CT scan of abdomen showed ?cholecystitis. In the
MICU, patient was started on meningitis doses of vanco and
ceftriaxone given her significantly altered mental status, and
flagyl for the abdominal CT findings. Then blood cultures grew
4/4 bottles of GPCs which were eventually found to be MRSA, and
a CXR later showed findings of pneumonia.  At that time her
fever source was identified, and her antimicrobials were pared
down to vancomycin and zosyn.  An infectious disease
consultation was obtained to find the source of her MRSA
bacteremia.  An echocardiogram confirmed the absence of
vegetations, and the source of the MRSA bacteremia was felt to
be related to her HD line.  Her tunneled HD line was removed on
[**2114-8-17**], and re-inserted on [**2114-8-20**].  She completed a course
of vancomycin/zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and will
continue vancomycin for a six week course for a presumed
endovascular source, to complete on [**2114-9-24**].  She is recieving
the vancomycin via HD protocol and will need vancomycin troughs
on the days of [**Year (4 digits) 2286**].  In addition to this she will need
safety lab monitoring during her vancomycin course, which per
IDSA guidlines is a weekly CBC with differential.  We recommend
that an infectious disease consultant be involved in her care,
if this cannot be arranged, then please contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13895**]
(consulting ID fellow) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**].  Line tip cultures were
negative, and surveillance cultures from [**Date range (1) 102796**] have [**Last Name (un) 22315**] no
growth to date.  A TEE was not attempted as the patient will
already complete a course adequate to cover for endocarditis.
.
Altered mental status - Her mental status declined from a
baseline of walking ~18 steps, feeding herself, interacting with
family, with orientation only to self to minimally responsive to
painful stimulus.  Patient has multiple prior admissions for AMS
that resolved spontaneously and have been attributed to multiple
metabolic derrangements including infections, ?post-ictal
states, missing [**Last Name (un) 2286**], hypoglycemia.  Most likely this
admission's altered mental status was related to the bacteremia
and dilantin toxicity.  Subdural hematoma was found to be stable
on CT head, so it was deemed to be an unlikely etiology.  An EEG
was consistent with severe encephalopa
