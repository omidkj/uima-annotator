None

History of Present Illness:
59F with CAD s/p multiple PCIs, ischemic CHF, Type I DM, Hx of
Anoxic Brain Injury, Anxiety, Depression who presents with
altered mental status sp ICD placement for ventricular
tachycradia. Per husbands report 5 weeks ago pt presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with small MI per his report. Was going to be DCd home
when she had an anxiety attack which led to VT and transfered to
ICU for one week. One week later transfered to rehab hospital
where on telemetry had high amount of ventricular arrythmia.
Cardiology at rehab thought she should have ICD placed. Patient
was admitted on [**2118-2-8**] to [**Hospital6 **] for
prophylactic placement of an ICD given history of ventricular
tachycardia. This placement was c/b small hematoma at ICD site
and episode of VT leading to ICD to fire. Patient was transfered
to ICU at OSH where patient had two further epidoses of VT that
required ICD firing. Briefly, while hospitalized patient started
on mexiletine for VT however liver enzymes trended up so this
medication was stopped. Metoprolol was also increased to 100mg
PO TID. During admission patient also found to have prolonged QT
so levaquin, amiodarone and xanax were stopped. At transfer
patient has been tachycardia free for one week last episode of
VT [**2-13**].
    Further while hospitalized at the OSH Celexa, Namenda and
xanax were stopped given patients delirium. Abilify and Remeron
were started. Patient's agitation appears to have been treated
with restraints and benzodiazepines. During that ICU stay
husband noticed increased anxiety and more delirium. No success
in understanding etiology of delirium. Poor PO intake. Family
asked by team there about making patient DNR/DNI. Family
contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], who has treated patient in the past and he
had patient transferred here for further evaluation of her
delirium. At the outside hosptial no infections identified or
treated. CT scan of head when admitted with MI [**2118-1-20**] and
