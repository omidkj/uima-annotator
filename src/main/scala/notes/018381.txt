hospital.  He had no chest pain, pleuritic pain, cough, fevers or
chills.  He did continue to have low blood pressures while in
house and his ace inhibitor was held, although he was continued
on Metoprolol.  He was continued on his inhalers as well as his
steroid taper.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute
exacerbation.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW UP:  The patient was told to follow up with
his primary care physician in one week to assess respiratory
function and to check his blood pressure in order to determine
