History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of small cell
lung cancer s/p completion of topotecan chemorx ([**2200-6-27**]) who was
initially admitted for failure to thrive, anemia, and
dehydration; now transferred to MICU for new onset of acute
right-upper quadrant abdominal pain, tachycardia, and relative
hypotension, hypoxia, and lactic acidosis.
He was initially admitted 3 days after initiating topotecan
therapy for small cell cancer recurrence due to diarrhea,
fatigue, and anemia.  Patient had been on ciprofloxacin for
neutropenic fever prophylaxis.  His diarrhea was thought
secondary to chemotherapy, and was treated with symptomatically.
 There was no history of fever, and patient denied chills or
feeling febrile.  He noticed acute onset of abdominal pain last
night while in bed, and denied nausea/vomitting.  Patient
acknowleged passing flatus and having loose bowel movements.  On
the morning of transfer, patient remained persistently
tachycardic and blood pressure was much lower than baseline at
110mmHg systolic (normally 150s-160s systolic).  He received a
total of 3 litres of saline in boluses.  Although he denied
dyspnea or chest discomfort, patient was also noted to have new
hypoxia to 85% on room air after receiving IV fluids, and was
placed on nasal cannula with improvement of saturation to
mid-90%.  A venous blood gas was obtained and showed a pH of
7.15 and lactate of 6.9.  Due to concern lactic acidosis and
abdominal pain, CT angiography of abdomen was ordered to
rule-out mesenteric ischemia, in addition to CT Torso.
.
In addition, cardiac enzymes were cycled starting at admission,
and patient was found to have elevated troponin to 0.57, with no
baseline for comparison.  His CK was only 117, but MB index was
elevated.  Initially, patient had no ischemic ECG changes, and
only sinus tachycardia.  Cardiology was consulted and
recommended deferring anticoagulation for the moment until
mesenteric ischemia was ruled-out.
.
Of note, patient also had some change in his baseline mental
status per his wife.  Reportedly, he has had this occur in the
past due to opioid therapy.  He is chronically on oxycodone SR
[**Hospital1 **] for diffuse pain related to his malignancy.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient was noted to have progressive
respiratory distress.  ABG was obtained, 7.31/19/405 on 100%
non-rebreather with an arterial lactate of 6.0 .  Patient became
agitated, tachypneic, and began pulling off oxygen mask.  He
denied any pain.  Endotracheal intubation was performed for
progressive respiratory distress.  Post-intubation, patient
required escalating dose of sedation, and received 100mcg
fentanyl and 3mg midazolam.  His non-invasive blood pressure
subsequently fell to 58 systolic.  He received 2 litres of LR
bolus through antecubital IV, and his blood pressure had
marginal improvement to MAP in low 50s.  Peripheral dopamine was
started, with MAPs improving to 65.  With subsequent fluid
boluses, dopamine was downtitrated and turned off.  Central
venous catheter was inserted and demonstrated a CVP of 7.

Pertinent Results:
No evidence of acute process as abscess, free air or peritoneal
fluid.

Previously described numerous metastases are still present in
the
retroperitoneum. The mass anterior to the left kidney measures
22 x 18 mm and has decreased in size (previously was 23 x 27
mm). The mass located posterior to the left kidney measures 22 x
16 mm and is unchanged in size. The mass located posterior to
the right kidney measures 12 x 12 mm and has decreased in size
(previously was 16 x 15 mm).

The liver presents some perfusion abnormalities in the venous
phase, otherwise unremarkable. Spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and
gallbladder are unremarkable. There are no gallstones.
Previously described hypoattenuating lesions in the right kidney
are again noted and probably correspond to cysts. No
hydronephrosis. Visualized intra-abdominal bowel loops are
unremarkable.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Previously described
metastasis anterior to the left iliacus muscle now measures 19 x
12 mm and has decreased in size (it was 21 x 16 mm). Bladder is
unremarkable. There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence
of diverticulitis.

No evidence of peritoneal fluid. The mass described in the
subcutaneous fat on the left side (series 30, image 110) just
superior to the gluteus muscles, now measures 12 mm and has
decreased in size (it was 15 mm previously).

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no definite osteolytic or
osteoblastic lesions.

CT ANGIOGRAPHY: There is diffuse atheromatous disease with mural
thrombus and calcification of the abdominal aorta and branches,
including iliac arteries. There is no evidence of mesenteric
ischemia. The origin of the celiac artery is stenotic.

Origin of SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and renal arteries are patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of abscess, cholecystitis, mesenteric ischemia or
perforation.
2. Stenosis of the celiac trunk.
3. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with mural thrombus in the
aorta
4. Previously described soft tissue masses are again noted, with
decrease in size in some of them as described above.
5. Unchanged right kidney cysts.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to MICU for lactic acidosis and was
intubated due to progressively increasing respiratory demands in
order to compensate for metabolic alkalosis.  Due to
intermittent episodes of hypotension and lactic acidosis, sepsis
was a presumed diagnosis and a central venous line was placed.
Cultures were obtained but did not demonstrate any source of
infection.  Presumed source was pulmonary due to infiltrates on
chest x-ray.  He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and
oral vancomycin to cover C. difficile.  CT Angiography of the
adomen did not demonstrate any compromised abdominal vasculature
or ischemic bowel.  There was also no intra-abdominal pocket of
infection evident radiographically.

Patient was also found to have positive cardiac enzymes during
the course of the admission.  Due to concern for ischemia, he
was started on heparin and cardiology was consulted.
Ultimately, it was felt that the biomarker elevation was
secondary to demand ischemia rather than a thrombotic process
and heparin was stopped.

On the night when patient expired, he was coded for 1 hour.  He
was transiently hypotensive and then dev
