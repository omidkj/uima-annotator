granulation tissue.

b. Fragments of skeletal muscle with focal degenerative changes.

c. Fibrovascular tissue with foci of thyroid tissue, no
malignancy identified.

2. Thyroid, left lobe, partial thyroidectomy (C-P):

a. Multinodular goiter with focal  hurthle cell changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] Commons on
[**2142-12-20**] for resection of an extrinsic source of airway
compression (i.e. substernal goiter) and underwent a
bronchoscopy with microdebridement, partial sternotomy with left
total and right subtotal thyroidectomy, and revision of her
longstanding tracheostomy (to allow better phonation and
communication) on [**2142-12-24**].  She tolerated the procedure well.
For details of the procedures, see operative dictations.

Post-operatively, she was transferred to the Cardiac surgery
recovery unit (CSRU) and was eventually weaned from the
ventilator on POD 2.  A bedside swallow evaluation showed no
overt evidence of aspiration.  Her diet was slowly advanced to a
regular dysphagia diet which was well-tolerated by discharge.

On POD 6, she was found to have a urinary tract infection
growing Klebsiella, Proteus and E.coli (resistant to
floroquinolones but sensitive to ceftriaxone and prescribed).
She was also febrile and found to have Coag pos., methicillin
resistant Staph. aureus grow from both anaerobic and aerobic
blood culture bottles for which she was eventually started on
vancomycin.

On POD 7, she underwent both rigid and flexible bronchoscopies
with placement of a T-tube in addition to a central venous line.
 Post-operatively, she was re-cultured for fever and found to
have Coag neg. Staph. aureus.  She was also noted to have a
suprasternal hematoma which was stable and not felt to be
clinically significant.  She had been intermittently febrile
therafter but defervesced by POD 13.  In anticipation of her
discharge, her CVL was removed after she had a PICC line placed
on POD 14 for continued antibiotic coverage.  (CVL tip culture
still no growth and pending at discharge.)  Lastly, on POD 14, a
sputum culture grew MRSA.

On POD 16, she was deemed stable and tolerating her regular
dysphagia diet.  She was also afebrile for 48 hours.  She was
therefore discharged to her Rehab facility in good condition
with recommendations to follow-up with Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) **] (Thoracic
Surgery) in 2 weeks and [**Doctor Last Name **] (Interventional
Pulmonology) in [**5-17**] weeks.  She is to maintain her intravenous
antibiotics for an additional 3 weeks and keep her T-tube capped
at all times, if possible.  Lastly, a work-up for her adrenal
mass was negative to date for pheochromocytoma but will be
completed as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (Endocrinology).
