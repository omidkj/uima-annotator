Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Diltiazem

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue/Dyspnea/Heart failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2110-9-11**] Exploration of R brachial artery, embolectomy
[**2110-9-9**] L thorc, lead placement, BiV pacer


History of Present Illness:
82 year old female status post CABG x 3 in [**2108**] who now is quite
symptomatic secondary to heart failure with a reduced left
ventricular ejection fraction and complete left bundle-branch
block.  She also has a very long atrioventricular conduction
time, which is also detrimental to optimal hemodynamics. An
attempt was made to place a lead transvenously however this was
not possible due to technical issues having to do with coronary
sinus anatomy. Her functional status continues to decline and
she currently complains of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion after
approximately 1 block of walking. In addition, she complains of
orthopnea. As she is likely to benefit from cardiac
resynchronization therapy, she has been referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
for placement of an LV lead.


Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Dyslipidemia
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2098**] treated in the past
with sotalol and dronedarone, both of which were discontinued
due
to inefficacy as well as post-cardioversion bradycardia.
- Persistent atrial fibrillation since [**2108-11-27**] despite
two cardioversions attempts, maintained in sinus rhythm now on
amiodarone 200 mg a day.
- Mixed cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction in the
range of 32% since [**2109-4-27**].
- Coronary artery disease bypass grafting x3 with a LIMA to the
LAD and reverse saphenous vein graft to the RCA and marginal
branches (Left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior
descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery and the marginal branch.)
- Chronic left bundle-branch block with mild-to-moderate AR and
trivial MR.
- Status post St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] and Anthem RF dual-chamber pacemaker
implantation in [**2109-12-28**] with capping of the LV port given
the absence of satisfactory CS anatomy.
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- hypercholesterolemia
- osteoporosis
- multifocal papillary thyroid cancer, small cell variant, s/p
150 mCi I-131 in [**2103**]
- basal cell carcinoma
- [**Last Name (un) 8061**] syndrome
- s/p cataract extraction OU
- macular degeneration
- R lung nodule
- s/p TAH

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2110-9-16**] 9:40 AM

Final Report: In comparison to prior examination, the pleural
effusions are stable to mildly increased in size. They are
bilateral. The remainder of the lungs are unchanged from prior
examination and the biventricular pacer along with a new
epicardial lead are in unchanged correct position.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable-to-slightly increased moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 98804**] is well known to cardiac surgery. She was a direct
admission to the operating room for LV lead placement via left
thoracotomy, please see operative report for details. She
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition on
Propofol and Neosynephrine infusions. She remained
hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op period, woke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On POD1 the patient
continued to require Neosynephrine to support blood pressure, it
was weaned to off on POD1. She had an epidural catheter for pain
control and this was removed on POD2.
On POD3 the patients axillary arterial line was removed, and she
was then noted to have numbness and loss of pulse on right hand,
she was seen by vascular surgery and ultimately brought to the
operating room for brachial artery exploration and  embolectomy,
see operative note for details. Following this procedure the
patient was fully anticoagulated. Her numbness resolved and she
had doplerable ulnar pulse.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout this
process but remained in the ICU to monitor her vascular
progress. She was transferred to the stepdown floor on POD7.
Once on the floor her hospital course was uneventful. She worked
with nursing, physical therapy and occupational therapy to
increase her mobility, strength and endurance.
On POD [**8-2**] she was transferredd to rehabilitation at [**Last Name (un) 1687**]
House in [**Location (un) 95809**]
