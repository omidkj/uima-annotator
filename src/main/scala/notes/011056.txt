respiratory disress and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is a 76yo gentleman who had recent redo repair of
thoracic aortic dissection with a course complicated by staph
bacteremia and post operative seizures who was transferred from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab with respiratory distress and hypotension.
.
He had been making good progress at rehab, and had been more
alert and was moving his hands and sitting in a chair.
Yesterday, he became more drowsy and developed a fever to 102.4,
and zosyn was started.  He was given a dose of zosyn.
Overnight, he had a large bowel movement and then shortly after
he became tachypneic (40-50s) and his oxygen saturation dropped
to 88% on FiO2 of 35%.  He was given 1mg of ativan and 40mg IV
lasix, and he made 200cc of urine over the next 3 hours.  His
oxygen sats improved with increasing his FiO2 to 100%.  There
was minimal output from his cholecystostomy tube.  He was sent
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care.
.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were significant for BP of
60/p, which improved to 112/51 on recheck, HR 99 with a temp of
104 and RR of 37.  His eyes were open.  Glucose was 116.  His
pressure then drifted down to 71/37 despite receiving four
liters of NS.  Peripheral dopamine was started, and he was noted
to be alert to verbal commands.  A femoral line was placed
(given b/l UE DVTs) and pressors were changed from dopamine to
norepinephrine.  Of note his HR climbed to 150s while on
dopamine.
.
His labs were significant for a respiratory alkalosis, lactate
of 2.2, WBC 8.1, Hct 31.8, troponin of 0.1 with a normal CK, AP
174 with normal other LFTs, Cr of 1.5 up from 1.0 and INR of
2.4.  Blood cultures were sent.  A CT torso was performed which
showed LLL collapse and tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacification of the right
lung fields with no intraabdominal pathology and no PE.   He
received 325mg per GJ tube, vancomycin 1gm IV, and 600mg of
tylenol PR.  CT surgery was consulted and recommended admission
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  On transfer to the floor his vital signs were HR
115, BP 112/53 RR 36, 100% on FiO2 of 100%, T 101.5 with
norepinephrine at 0.9mcg/kg/min.
.
Per nursing report, his IV infiltrated with contrast during the
CT torso and plastics placed a dressing over his right arm.
.
Unable to obtain review of systems secondary to mental status.

his limbs other than moving his toes and fingers and was not
antigravity, he was
areflexic"
 - dc'd to rehab [**11-11**] on trach collar with CPAP
Readmitted [**Date range (1) 104398**] with fever and seizures
 - coag negative staph bacteremia from PICC line
 - found to have Cholecystitis but not felt to be operative
candidate, so had percutaneous choleycystostomy tube
 - left subclavian DVT noted [**11-22**]
 - dc'd back to rehab with plan for 6 weeks of vancomycin and
return in [**1-4**] months for cholecystectomy
pAFib s/p ablation [**7-/2137**], on coumadin
s/p PPM for tachy-brady syndrome
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
PVD
Anemia, felt to be due to chronic disease
h/o CHF with preserved EF
Diverticulosis
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Spinal Stenosis

STUDIES:
PICC placement [**2137-12-10**]:
1. Evidence of occlusion involving the bilateral subclavian
veins with no
central access available for catheter placement.
2. 20 cm PICC placed via right basilic access with the tip
located in the mid axillary line. Please note that this is not a
central venous catheter given occlusion of the right subclavian
vein.
.
CXR [**12-3**]:  Left basilar consolidation, likely reflecting lower
lobe collapse and left pleural effusion, similar to the
comparison study.
.
CT Torso [**12-3**] :
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial
system is well
opacified and there is no embolic filling defect. A tracheostomy
tube is
visualized in good position. Lungs are notable for intralobular
septal
thickening and scattered areas of ground-glass density. A left
pleural
effusion is slightly larger than on the comparison study. There
is no right pleural effusion. Interpretation of fine detail is
slightly obscured by respiratory
