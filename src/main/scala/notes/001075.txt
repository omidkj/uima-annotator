History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 68 yo active retired man with hemochromatosis,
cirrhosis and DM, who had a mechanical fall 2 weeks prior to
admission while at his winter home in [**State 108**].  After falling,
he developed left sided rib pain (later found to be due to rib
fracture), and sought care at the local ED, where he was told to
take tylenol. After continuing to have pain for several more
days he returned to the ED and was prescribed motrin for the rib
pain. He reports taking 600mg every 4-5 hrs for 3-4 days. He
also reports having very diminished appetite and eating and
drinking very little during this time. Three days PTA, he
developed SOB. At the urging of his children, he flew back from
FL to be seen here in [**Location (un) 86**]. In addition to decreased PO
intake, he reported insomnia and nausea/dry heaves.  He denied
abdominal pain, fevers, chills, sick contacts, or travel out of
the country.
.
On admission, EKG showed right heart strain and possible lateral
ischemic changes.  Pulmonary embolism was considered; V/Q scan
was read as low probability. Acute coronary syndrome was also
considered, and cardiac enzymes were elevated with troponin 0.12
and MB index 14.8. Heparin gtt was started, along with ASA and
beta blocker. Also on admission, he was found to have lactic
acidosis in setting of ARF (creatinine 3.4 with baseline 1.1)
with serum lactate 3.9 --> 6.7 and Anion Gap of 25.  Serum
potassium was 6.0 and bicarb 12. He was given bicarb gtt for
acidosis and kayexelate, insulin and glucose for elevated K.
.
Initial temp was 94.4 and CXR showed vague opacity in RML.
Blood cultures were drawn and levo/vanc started.  In the ED,
patient has 2 transient episodes of hypotension which resolved
spontaneously.  He was admitted to the MICU.

STUDIES:
.
#. V/Q scan [**2143-1-7**]
INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate very heterogenous ventilation with numerous
subsegmental defects bilaterally. Perfusion images in the same 8
views show numerous small bilateral non-segmental defects. These
defects are in the same areas as the ventilation defects, but
are less prominent. The AP dimension is enlarged, and the
diaphgrams are flattened. The chest x-ray is clear.
The above findings are consistent with a low probability for
pulmonary embolism, but are consistent with COPD.
.
#. TTE [**2143-1-8**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate-severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w a primary pulmonary
process.
.
#. ECG [**2143-1-9**]
Sinus rhythm, right ventricular hypertrophy, Diffuse ST-T wave
changes with borderline prolonged/upper limits of normal Q-Tc
interval - could be due in part to right ventricular hypertrophy
but clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of
[**2143-1-8**], further ST-T wave changes present and Q-Tc interval
appears short.
.
#. CT chest with Contrast [**2143-1-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right loculated collection which has high CT attenuation
value and may represent either empyema or hemorrhage within
pleural effusion.
2. Right lower lobe opacity with bronchial wall thickening which
may represent pneumonia/aspiration.
3. Right basilar atelectasis.
4. Small left pleural effusion.
5. Ground-glass opacity in the right apex. This should be
followed up with a CT in three months.
6. Focal ground-glass opacity in the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe may represent infectious/inflammatory etiology. This
could also be followed up on the CT which will be obtained in
three months.
7. Atherosclerotic coronary calcifications.
8. Gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.
9. Liver granulomas.
.
#. Renal US [**2143-1-10**]:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9 cm in length, previously
measuring 9.5 cm. The left kidney measures 10.2 cm in length,
previously measuring 10.7 cm in length. In the interpolar region
of the right kidney, there is an area with lobulated appearance
consistent with cortical scarring, unchanged from the prior
study. In the interpolar region of the left kidney, there is a
tiny cortical crystal. There is no hydronephrosis, stones, or
renal masses. There is no perirenal fluid. The bladder is
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval decrease in size in both kidneys.
2. There is no hydronephrosis.
3. Stable area of cortical scarring in the right kidney.
.
#. TEE [**2143-1-15**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but is probably
normal.
3. There are complex (>4mm) sessile atheroma in the aortic arch.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a small pericardial effusion.
7. No evidence of endocarditis seen.
.
#. CTA Chest [**2143-1-16**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Unchanged right loculated collection within the pleural spa
