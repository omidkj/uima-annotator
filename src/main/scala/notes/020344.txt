1. Cardiac -
Rhythm: The patient maintained normal sinus rhythm throughout
his hospital stay.

CAD: The patient was maintained on a statin, Plavix, ASA, and
Tricor. No beta-blocker or ACE-I as his SBP goal was 120-160 and
he came to the CCU with a SBP < 100.
2. Neuro - status post [**Country **] stent
-Goal to maintain SBP from 120-160. Fluid boluses were given
upon admission to the CCU initially to maintain SBP and the
patient was encouraged to get out of bed so that his
catecholamine response would increase and thus increase his BP.
However, when his SBP remained <100, 0.5 mcg of neosynephrine
was started and his SBP remained around 120. The neo was weaned
off on [**2110-5-28**] in the am and the patient did not require any
further boluses with his SBP in the 120s. He was able to get up
out of bed and walk around without difficulty.
3. Endocrine - Diabetes
- The patient was continued on sliding scale insulin. Upon
discharge, he was instructed to resume his outpatient
medications.
4. Urology - history of prostate cancer
 - The patient continued his Casodex 50 mg PO QD.
5. Pulmonary - COPD
- The patient received Albuterol nebs, Salmeterol, Fluticasone
and experienced no respiratory distress.
6. The patient confirmed that he wishes to remain DNR/DNI.
7. Dispo - The patient was discharged on [**2110-5-28**] with SBP 120s.
Did not require any neo or fluid boluses throughout the
remainder of the day. He was able to get out of bed and ambulate
without difficulty.
