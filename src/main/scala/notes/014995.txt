Pertinent Results:
[**5-26**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had
85-90% stenosis in the mid vessel at the level of D1 with
another tapering 80% lesion more distally. The distal LAD fills
via collaterals from the PDA. The LCx has an 80% stenosis in the
OM1 at the ostia of the upper and lower poles. The RCA has 80%
instent restenosis of the proximal PDA. 2. Limited resting
hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial hypertension
with a central aortic pressure of 169/88 mmHg.
[**5-26**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA with no stenosis. Left ICA with no
stenosis.
[**5-27**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). 2. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. 3. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. 4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. 5. There is no pericardial effusion. POST-CPB: 1. The
patient is AV paced and on an infusion of phenylephrine. 2.
Biventricular function is preserved. 3. The aorta is intact. 4.
PA catheter is in good position in the proximal right PA. 5. The
remainder of the examination is unchanged.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Mildly dilated descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **]
of the mitral chordae (normal variant). No resting LVOT
gradient.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
2. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
3. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. There is no pericardial effusion.

Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified in person of the
results.

POST-CPB:

1. The patient is AV paced and on an infusion of phenylephrine.
2. Biventricular function is preserved.
3. The aorta is intact.
4. PA catheter is in good position in the proximal right PA.
5. The remainder of the examination is unchanged.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
