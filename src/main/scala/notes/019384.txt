History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87162**] is a 52 y/o male with bipolar d/o well controlled on
lithium who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital following 3 days of
fever, cough and nausea. Noted to have AMS, garbled speech and
was ataxic. Denied toxic ingestions, substances of abuse.
Complained of diarrhea over 1 week. Labs notable for acute renal
failure, hyponatremia (126), metabolic acidosis and plt count of
40. A head CT was negative, CXR revealed a possible LLL PNA, and
CT abd/pelvis was remarable for perinephric stranding and a
thickened GB wall. Lithium level was WNL. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.
.
On arrival to the ED here, the patient's vitals were 98.1 98
105/72 20 94% RA. An ECG showed NSR. Laboratory studies were
remarkable for hyponatermia, ARF, WBC 2.9 with 18% bands, plt
count of 40. A lumbar puncture was done with ptn 31 and glucose
74 (serum glucose 116).  Tox screen (-).  The patient was given
2g ceftriaxone, 1g vanco, 500mg azithro for ? pneumonia,
coverage for meningitis/encephalitis. No acyclovir given CSF
results. While in the ED, the patient spiked a fever to 101.1F.
Pressure droped to 85 systolic, 105-115's after 2L IVF in our
ED, getting a 3rd on transfer.  BP currently 91/55.
Had Profuse, watery, greenish, profuse, guaiac positive
diarrhea. Sent for CDiff and Culture.  Given concern for TTP, a
smear was reviewed that showed bandemia but no schistocytes or
other evidence of TTP/HUS. Concern for sepsis and admitted to
the ICU.
.
On arrival to the ICU the patient's vitals were 97.9 90 96/76 16
95%. Described some back pain but not other complaints at this
time

Pertinent Results:
Radiology
CT abdomen at OSH from [**10-10**]
LUNG BASES: The imaged lung bases are clear aside from mild
dependent
atelectasis.   ABDOMEN: The non-contrast appearance of the
liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, and both adrenal glands is
normal. There is no hydronephrosis or kidney stones. Bilateral
perinephric stranding is nonspecific. The abdominal aorta is
normal in course and caliber. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric
lymphadenopathy is seen. No free air or free fluid is seen. The
stomach and duodenum appear normal.
PELVIS: Loops of small bowel demonstrate no signs of ileus or
obstruction.  The appendix is normal. There is no apparent
thickening of the colon and no signs of diverticulosis. No free
pelvic fluid. Urinary bladder is distended appearing normal. No
inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. BONES: No worrisome bony
lesions are seen. IMPRESSION:
1. Nonspecific perinephric stranding. Please correlate for
possible
infection. 2. No signs of colitis or bowel obstruction.

CT head [**10-10**]
There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, shift
of
normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular
territorial infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. Ventricles are normal in size and configuration.
Imaged paranasal sinuses are clear.  Mastoid air cells are
opacified on the left. Left middle ear cavity, right middle ear
cavity and right mastoid air cells are well aerated. The bony
calvarium is intact. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted along
the paranasal sinuses. IMPRESSION: Opacification of the left
mastoid air cells. No evidence of acute infarction or
hemorrhage. Consider MRI to further assess as needed.

CXR [**10-11**]
A small right subhilar region of heterogeneous opacity obscures
the hemidiaphragmatic contour. Dilation of the azygos vein and
left atrium, in addition to mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
is new. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent subhilar right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Elevated venous pressure consistent with hypervolemia.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2169-10-15**]  IMPRESSION:
1. No obvious focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute
infarct.
2. Increased signal intensity in the mastoid air cells, from
fluid/mucosal
thickening, left more than right.
3. Nonspecific FLAIR hyperintense foci in the cerebral white
matter- etiology uncertain. Followup can be considered as no
prior studies are available with post-contrast images if
necessary after clinical and lab correlation.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2169-10-18**] IMPRESSION: Resolved
right subhilar lower lobe pneumonia.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2169-10-25**]  VIDEO
OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Video oropharyngeal swallow study was
performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow team.
Multiple consistencies of barium were administered. There is
aspiration with thin liquids. There is aspiration with
nectar-thickened liquids, but somewhat less than with the thin
liquids. There is a swallow delay and residuals within the
vallecula.
IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
For complete report, please see speech and swallow note in OMR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87162**] is a 52 y/o M with biploar presenting with sepsis,
pancytopenia, [**Last Name (un) **], PNA, diarrhea, AMS. Also has nephrogenic DI
[**12-21**] lithium toxicity. CXR suggestive of PNA. Anaplasma PCR also
positive. Anaplasma likely major cause of his presentation.
.
## Anaplasmosis: Mr. [**Known lastname 87162**] was found to have positive PCR for
Anaplasma at [**Hospital3 **] hospital, which was complicated by skin
rash characterized by classic target lesions on his arms,
leukopenia, and
