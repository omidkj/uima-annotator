CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from outside medical hospital with
refractory anion gap acidosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 41-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for hypertension
(untreated) and asthma with seasonal allergies, who presented
to an outside hospital on [**5-18**] with a five day history of
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive weakness and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with
refractory anion gap acidosis and ketoacidosis.

Patient was reported in his usual state of health until
approximately five days prior to admission, when he reports
acute onset nausea followed by vomiting and watery diarrhea.
The patient reports occasional episodes of vomiting and
diarrhea initially, however, after two days, the frequency
and severity progressively worsened to approximately 10-30
episodes per day of bilious nonbloody vomiting, and 10-30
episodes per day of brown-watery diarrhea with little to no
oral intake for approximately three days.

During this time, the patient reports progressive generalized
weakness (proximal greater than distal muscle groups) with
significant fatigue and lightheadedness.  He also reports
unsteadiness secondary to generalized weakness with a
reported fall with subsequent trauma to his right arm prior
to admission.  The patient denies fever, chills, rash,
arthralgias, headache, cough, recent travel, sick contacts,
toxic ingestions, as well as exposures.  Patient presented to
the outside hospital Emergency Department with the inability
to walk, dyspnea on exertion, and worsening fatigue.  By the
time of admission to the outside hospital, the patient's
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea had [**Hospital1 4351**] resolved.

In the outside hospital Emergency Department, patient was
found afebrile and hemodynamically stable with positive serum
and urine ketones (ABG 7.21/23/86/95% on room air), anion gap
34, normal serum glucose, and negative serum toxin screen
except for salicylates.  The patient was treated with 2
liters of normal saline without significant change in his
blood pH, which was subsequently changed to normal saline
with 5 amps of sodium bicarb.  The patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

Of note, the patient recalls two prior episodes when he
developed similar prodrome of symptoms including nausea,
vomiting, and weakness.  The first of these episodes occurred
in his early 20's, when he reports significant nausea and
vomiting with progressive weakness.  A family friend, who is
a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4351**] treated the patient with antiemetics
and his symptoms resolved without need for official medical
attention.

The second episode occurred in [**2121-11-17**], when the
patient again developed nausea, vomiting, and weakness,
without clear precipitant.  The symptoms were significant
enough to prompt the patient to seek medical attention at an
outside hospital Emergency Department.  Per the patient's
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found at the time of
presentation to have an anion gap of 23 with a bicarb of 16
and ketonuria.  The patient's liver function tests were
elevated with an AST of 354, ALT of 104, GTT 154, and total
bilirubin of 1.2.  Patient's LDH at the time was 340 with CKs
greater than 600.  Patient was [**Name10 (NameIs) 4351**] treated with IV
hydration that corrected his anion gap acidosis and
discharged to home from the Emergency Department.

A subsequent Gastroenterology workup for his elevated liver
function tests included a right upper quadrant ultrasound, as
well as blood work evaluating possible infectious, toxic, or
immunologic causes.  Per the patient's primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] workup was essentially negative, and the
primary care physician was recommended to followup with a
repeat CK at a later date for evaluation for possible primary
muscular abnormality.  However, the patient remained
asymptomatic without further exacerbations of his
aforementioned abnormalities, and no further workup was done.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. Seasonal allergies.
3. Hypertension (untreated).

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Advair.
2. Zyrtec.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**University/College **],
[**State 350**], and is employed as an environmental scientist.
He reports a history of binge drinking in college, however,
denies current alcohol use with last alcoholic intake
approximately six months prior to admission.  He also denies
tobacco, illicit drug use, as well as herbal remedies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother is alive and well at
the age of 70, patient's father is deceased secondary to an
accident, and patient has a brother who is otherwise healthy.
No known history of diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease,
malignancies, or muscle abnormalities.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.8, heart rate
127, blood pressure 133/77, respiratory rate 35, oxygen
saturation 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general, the
patient is a thin middle age male in mild distress appearing
diaphoretic and tachypneic.  HEENT exam:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Anicteric sclerae.  Extraocular movements
are intact bilaterally.  Moist mucous membranes, with no oral
lesions.  Neck exam:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  No jugular venous distention was appreciated.
Pulmonary examination:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no
wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular exam:
Tachycardic, regular, normal S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Soft, normoactive bowel sounds,
nontender, and nondistended with no masses appreciated.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with intact distal
pulses, no rashes.  Neurological examination:  Alert, awake,
oriented x3, appropriate, cranial nerves II through XII
intact, diffusely weak 4+/5 motor strength throughout with no
focal signs of weakness, reflexes 2+ patellar, 2+ brachial
symmetric bilaterally.  Sensation intact.  Gait deferred,
cerebellar intact, finger-to-nose and rapid-alternating
movements.

LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  At [**Hospital6 48670**]:  Complete blood count with a white blood cell count
of 13.3, hematocrit 40.2, MCV 104, and platelets of 183 with
a white blood cell differential of 89% polys, 4% lymphocytes,
6% monocytes.  Chem-7 with a sodium of 137, potassium 4.9,
chloride 92, bicarb 11, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, and glucose
of 72.  Serum tox screen is notable for a salicylate level of
4.5, Tylenol less than 10, otherwise negative.  Large serum
acetone was measured.  Arterial blood gas at the outside
hospital:  7.21/23/86 with 95% on room air.  Initial CK of
2,543 with a negative MB index of 0.9, lactic acid 2.3, TSH
0.36 and urinalysis with greater than 80 ketones.

Initial blood work at [**Hospital1 69**]:
Chem-7 with a sodium of 134, potassium 6.9, chloride 96,
bicarb 10, BUN 19, creatinine 1.2, and glucose of 105
(notable for a gross hemolysis).  AST 393, ALT 173, LDH
1,309.  CK 3,704, alkaline phosphatase 48, amylase 27, total
bilirubin 0.9, albumin 4.4, calcium 8.0, magnesium 1.1, and
phosphorus 3.7.  Calculated serum OSM was 295.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15593**] Care Unit, where he remained
afebrile, tachycardic to the 130s, tachypneic to the 40s with
adequate oxygen saturation on 2 liters nasal cannula, and
normotensive.  The patient received aggressive hydration,
initially with D5 half normal saline (x3 liters), eventually
changed to lactated ringers with the addition of bicarbonate
drip (2 liters with 3 amps of sodium bicarb) for persistent
metabolic acidosis.  Despite patient's persistent laboratory
abnormalities, the patient demonstrated significant clinical
improvement with no further episodes of nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea.  Patient's strength also progressively improved
with downtrending heart rate as well as respiratory rate.
