abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year-old Female with a PMH significant for sick
sinus syndrome (with permanent pacemaker placement in [**2196**]), RLD
(oxygen-dependent on 3L via nasal cannula at baseline), CHF,
TIA, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (failed anti-arrhythmic
therapy, rate-controlled at home with Metoprolol), HTN,
neurogenic bladder with ileal conduit who was admitted on
[**2198-12-18**] to the ACS surgery service for conservative management
of a recurrent small bowel obstruction.
.
She presented with typical features of her prior small bowel
obstructions, with nausea, bilious emesis and diffuse abdominal
pain and no flatus. An NGT was placed on admission. She required
T-SICU admission given some initial episodes of rapid
ventricular response in the ED. She was conservatively managed
with IV fluids (1L in T-SICU), NPO status and NGT management
with improvement. She has return of flatus and her NGT was
removed on [**2198-12-21**]. Did get a dose of IV Ceftriaxone given a
positive U/A, but this was discontinued given her chronic ileal
conduit catheterization. She also had a right tympanic membrane
perforation with some bleeding ottorhea which resolved on [**2198-12-23**]
with stable auditory exam. Her SBO improved and she resumed diet
on [**2198-12-25**]. The patient has noted paroxysmal A.fib and had
persistent episodes of RVR to a ventricular rate of 150s on
[**2198-12-26**] with persistent hypotension to the 80-90s mmHg without
only some lightheadedness; no chest pain, shortness of breath or
syncope. Patient responded to IV Lopressor dosing. She had been
maintained on Metoprolol 50 mg PO BID, Diltiazem 180 mg PO QID
(home dose being daily) and Digoxin 0.0625 mg PO daily since
return of bowel function. She was transferred to Medicine for
further management of hypotension with A.fib and RVR.

Of note, that patient had been admitted with a prior SBO in [**2196**]
and required Cardiology consultation for a similar clinical
picture. In the setting of being NPO she had several paroxysms
of atrial fibrillation to a ventricular rate of 150 bpm. They
recommended they recommended rate control with Lopressor and
Diltiazem along with Digoxin - with transition to PO Metoprolol
on discharge. Rhythm control was deferred given the paroxysmal
nature and she had previously failed anti-arrhythmic therapy.
.
On the floor, she is without complaints. She notes only mild
fatigue and no shortness of breath or chest pain. She denies
palpitations, dizziness or diaphoresis.

IMAGING:
[**2198-12-18**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - There is marked and high-grade
small-bowel obstruction. The distal ileum appears essentially
collapsed as is the colon; the appearances are suggestive of a
transition point in either the right lower quadrant, where
multiple tethered loops of bowel are noted or else anteriorly
adjacent to the stoma at the site of prior obstructions-these
two areas are in close proximity.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with a PMH significant for sick sinus syndrome (with
permanent pacemaker placement in [**2196**]), RLD/COPD
(oxygen-dependent on 3L via nasal cannula at baseline),
diastolic congestive heart failure, TIA, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation (failed anti-arrhythmic therapy, rate-controlled at
home with Metoprolol), neurogenic bladder with ileal conduit who
was admitted on [**2198-12-18**] to the ACS surgery service for
conservative management of a recurrent small bowel obstruction
and subsequently transferred to the medical service for
management of atrial fibrillation and hypotension due to excess
diltiazem.

# RECURRENT SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION - Admitted to surgical
service with clinical and CT evidence of small bowel obstruction
similar to prior episodes, without surgical indications per ACS.
Conservatively managed with N
