CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: assess LLL atelectasis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
28 year old woman with fever atelectasis seen on prio film
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess LLL atelectasis
INDICATION: Fever, atelectasis seen on prior film.

COMPARISONS: [**2195-12-6**].

PA and lateral chest radiographs show stable cardiac and
mediastinal silhouettes. Again seen are median sternotomy wires
and prosthetic mitral valve. There has been interval improvement
in the previously seen left retrocardiac opacity suggesting
improving atelectasis. No focal opacities are seen. No pleural
effusions are seen.

IMPRESSION: Improved left retrocardiac opacity suggestive of
improving atelectasis.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial septum. Prominent
Eustachian
valve (normal variant).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline dilated
LV cavity
size. Mild global LV hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -

inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened aortic
valve
leaflets. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Myxomatous
mitral valve
leaflets. Moderate/severe MVP. Mild mitral annular
calcification. No MS.
Moderate (2+) MR. Eccentric MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
for the
patient.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed EF about 50%. . Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending,
transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are small in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic
plaque. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace to mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe posterior
mitral valve
leaflet prolapse. Mild anterior leaflet prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Post CPB Normal RV systolic function. LV with continued mild
global
hypokinesis, EF about 50%. Mitral bioprosthesis is well seated,
normal leaflet
function. There is trace valvular and perivalvular MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. [**Name13 (STitle) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47766**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-12-1**] for further
management of her dyspnea on exertion. She was taken to the
catheterization lab where she was found to have no significant
CAD, severe MVP and regurgitation with moderate pulmonary
hypertension, LVEF 51%. Given the severity of her disease, the
cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical repair of
her valve disease. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner including an echocardiogram which revealed trace Aortic
insufficiency, 4+ mitral regurgitation with myxomatous leaflets,
and an LV ejection fraction of 61%, RVEF 58%, bilateral atrial
enlargement. On [**2195-12-1**], Ms. [**Known lastname 47766**] was taken to the
operating room. She underwent a mitral valve replacement using a
25mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial model 2800 bioprosthesis.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated.  Beta blockade and
aspirin were resumed. She was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. On POD 2 Her pressors were weaned, chest
tubes were re
