Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain / left testicular pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2157-8-24**] - exploration of retroperitoneum through previous
midline incision with washout and component separation and
abdominal wall closure with polypropylene mesh overlay.

Percutaneus drain placement


History of Present Illness:
53M with lumbar spondylosis who recently underwent anterior
lumbar interbody fusion ([**2157-8-18**]) and posterior placement of
percutaneous pedical screws ([**2157-8-19**]) returns to the ED one day
after being discharged to home with abdominal pain and left
testicular pain.  The patient reports he was feeling somewhat
distended after surgery but had attributed this to constipation;
he had a bowel movement yesterday and was discharged to home in
good condition.  Today, however, he found that the abdominal
pain
and distention was increasing, and he began to experience pain
and tenderness in the left testicle.  He complained of
left-sided
abdominal tenderness as well.

ROS is negative for fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting, chest pain.

He does endorse some shortness of breath, which he attributes to
his asthma.  Notably during the posterior pedical screw
placement
on [**8-19**] he vomited and aspirated some gastric contents;
subsequent chest x-rays demonstrated some evidence of aspiration
however the patient did not clinically have pneumonia and was
discharged to home.

A CXR and KUB in the ED were essentially unremarkable.  A CT
scan
of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a large retroperitoneal
hematoma.  Vascular surgery consult is requested due to this
finding.

CT SCAN

IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease in the size of the left-sided,
retroperitoneal
abdominal/pelvic hematoma.
2. Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
3. Partial left-sided obstruction of the collecting system with
dilation of the renal pelvis secondary to compression of the
ureter by the
retroperitoneal hematoma.

XRAY:

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated. There are no focal parenchymal opacities suggesting
pneumonia.
Unchanged mild retrocardiac atelectasis, unchanged mild widening
of the
mediastinum, notably on the right, without evidence of abnormal
contours.
This finding requires radiological followup.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the floor on [**2157-8-23**].  He was taken to the
operating room on [**8-24**] for washout and evacuation of his
hematoma and had an additional component separation with
polypropylene mesh overlay for appropriate closure of his
abdominal wall.  This proceeded without complication and he was
returned to the floor in stable condition.

[**8-24**] - [**8-29**]

His postoperative course was complicated by pain control issues
and abdominal distention and illeus.  KUB showed dilation of
large bowel, especially cecum and dilated small bowel loops.
Narcotics were minimized. He was made NPO and serial KUBs showed
passage of gas through colon. Patient reported flatus
throughout. NG tube was inserted. pt [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1788**]. Illeus resolved,
with decreased distention on physical exam he was advanced to a
clear liquid diet which he tolerated well and JP drains were
dc'd by gen surgery.

Also on exam patient was found to have [**1-8**]+ edema in b/l lower
extremities but left slightly greater than right.  A duplex
study was obtained to r/o DVT which was negative.  Lasix
diuresis was started with 20 mg IV to which he responded well.
He was advanced to a regular diet.

Hct was found to be trending down, his SQ heparin was  stopped.
He was  transfused PRBC. responded well. Also his creatinine was
1.9, Baseline 0.9 Maintained good urine output. LR started foe
increase creatinine. After 1 unit, HCT increased to 29.9. ARF
resolved with IV fluids, Through out the hospital course. On DC,
normalized to 0.9.

[**8-30**] - [**9-1**]

Pt was seen in morning rounds, complaining of SOB he was
diaphoritic, Code red was called. Pt was intubated on the floor
and transferred to the CVICU. CTA was performed. Found to have
PE. IV heparin was started. Pt had TEE showing right heart
strain. He also had a troponin leak. This has normalized. He was
extubated without sequele.

[**9-2**] - [**9-6**]

Transfered back to the VICU. He was delined. diet readvanced. Pt
did have fevers to 102. IV antibiotics started emperically. The
recollection of fluid was thought to be a possible source. Pt
went for percutaneous drainage and placement of drain. All cx
are negative from flui. CXR and Blood cx are also negative. IV
antibiotics stopped, put on PO augmentin prophylactically.

[**9-6**] - [**9-9**]

IV heparin swithched to Lovenox. Now on lovenox / coumadin
bridge. PT, case management. Stable for rehab
