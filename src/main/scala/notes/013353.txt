Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with past medical history of COPD on 3L home
oxygen, hypertension, AAA s/p endovascular repair of
abdominal aortic aneurysm c/b STEMI requiring BMS LM, RCA as
well limb ischemia requiring left femoral endarterectomy on
[**2145-5-22**] now presenting with increasing SOB, sputum production
x2days.
.
Patient was in USOH when noted gradual onset increased DOE with
moderate increase in sputum production though no change in
sputum character. Denies associated fever, HA, rhinorrhea, sore
throat, chest pain, pleuritic pain, dysuria, calf
tenderness/swelling, LE edema, PND, orthopenia. No recent sick
contacts, recent travel. Reports complaince with lasix though
notes self-d/c of flovent in recent months. This morning in
setting of worsening SOB with associated wheeze checked O2 on
home pulse oximeter and noted to be 87% on home 3L so called
EMS.
.
On presentation to the ED, initial VS were: T 97.6, HR 102, BP
139/65, RR 17, O2 sat 90% 6L. 100% on NRB. Initial VBG showed
7.26/101/43/47 On exam poor aeration. CXR demonstrated
?pulmonary edema. Placed on noninvasive ventilation with
improvement of symptoms and stabilization of O2 sats. Patient
received levofloxacin 750mg, Lasix 20mg IV, Methylpred 125 IV,
2duonebs in treatment of likely COPD exacerbation as well as
mild volume overload.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  patient reports he is feeling better;
though wheezy, shortness of breath had improved and is again
without complaints of pain.
.

LENI NO DVT [**2146-3-20**]
ECHO [**2146-3-21**] The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and global systolic function.

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT [**2146-3-21**] As compared to the previous
examination, there is slightly improved contrast filling,
currently no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but a filling
inhomogeneity in the lingular artery. Bilateral mild-to-moderate
pleural effusions, bilateral areas of dorsal and perifissural
atelectasis. No evidence of right heart strain. No enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes.  Saber-sheath trachea.

CXR [**2146-3-20**] Mild congestive heart failure with bibasilar
atelectasis and
small bilateral pleural effusions.cardiomediastinal silhouette
consistent with

CXR [**2146-3-25**] Tip of right PICC terminates in the lower superior
vena cava.
Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Improving bilateral lower
lobe
opacities, possibly due to previously provided diagnosis of
aspiration
pneumonia. Vascular congestion has resolved. Pleural effusions
are probably unchanged allowing for incomplete imaging of the
costophrenic angle regions.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with past medical history of COPD on 3L home
oxygen, hypertension, AAA s/p endovascular repair of abdominal
aortic aneurysm c/b STEMI requiring BMS LM, RCA as well limb
ischemia requiring left femoral endarterectomy on [**2145-5-22**] now
presenting with increasing SOB, sputum production x2days with
e/o hypoxic, hybercarbic respiratory failure.
.
# Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure. Different diagnosis
included acute COPD exacerabtion, heart failure, PE, pneumonia.
History was most consistent with acute COPD flare with increased
sputum production/change in character as well as increasing
dyspnea. Exam with poor air movement, diffuse wheeze. No clear
viral or bacterial URI as nidus to infection, however bilateral
opacities R>L concerning for infection. However history not c/w
PNA as patient lacks robust sputum production/change, fever,
leukocytosis. CXR with increased interstial markings which
raised the question of volume overload; TTE in [**1-17**] with
preserved RV and LV function and patient without worsening
edema, orthopnea, PND. Troponins were negative. Pulmonary
embolus was thought unlikely.
On arrival he required BiPAP, but was able to be weaned to a
face mask the next morning. He was treated with azithromycin for
possible infection and anti-inflammatory properties. He was
diuresed with IV lasix in case of a component of acute on
chronic CHF. He was treated for a COPD exacerbation with
methylprednisone, then converted to PO prednisone. He is being
written for a prednisone taper to be continued at rehab. He
should continue with nebulizers and inhaled f
