Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Briefly this is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o female w/ pmhx of HTN,
parkinson/alzheimer's,on chronic prednisone (10mg daily)started
this year ([**1-/2151**]) for temporal arteritis, who initially
presented with fatigue and question of aspiration with oxygen
saturation of 80% RA at rehab who was admitted [**8-4**]. She was
initially doing well on 3L NC,and was found to have lactate 3.0.
500-1000cc fluid given in the ED. Her dyspnea worsened
throughout the day [**8-5**], and pulm. edema and questionable right
lower lobe infiltrate noted on CXR,however clinically looked
dehyrdated. She also had low urine output, been afebrile, with
WBC 20, 2% bands,and LDH approx. 5000. She is now being
transferred to the MICU for resp. distress.
.
Of note a [**Month/Day (2) 53767**] in [**Name2 (NI) 73564**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] prior to transfer
to the MICU and her DNR/DNI status was confirmed.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient's vitals were: P-92,
BP-138/100, 97% venti mask 30%. The patient denies abdominal
pain,cough, chest pain, but notes difficulty breathing.She
cannot speak in full sentences and is in moderate distress.

.
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with dementia and Parkinson's disease who
presents with shortness of breath. Over the past two days she
has felt weak and unable to walk (usually walks with a walker).
She has been having trouble swallowing and has not been eating
well. Her aid thought she might have choked after drinking water
this morning. Shortly after drinking she developed shortness of
breath and cough. EMS was called and the patient was found to
have hypoxia with sats low 80s% on RA.
In the ED, initial vitals: (unknown temp), HR 83, BP 80/60, RR
16 O2 99% NRB. She subsequently required 3L via NC. Labs notable
for lactate 6.0, trop 0.08, creatinine 1.1 (baseline 0.6), WBC
17 with 2% bands, HCT 24 (baseline 31), HCO3 17 with AG 17, pBNP
[**Numeric Identifier **]. ECG showed sinus rhythm at 88 bpm, TWI in lead III, no
other ST/T changes. She received 500cc IVF in the ED, after
which lactate dropped to 3.1. CXR showed pulmonary edema and
possible RLL infiltrate. Blood cultures were sent and the
patient then received 2g cefepime and 750mg levofloxacin. Vitals
prior to transfer: 77 96% 2L 122/43 20 99F.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient notes malaise, minimal
nonproductive cough, dyspnea at rest and a change in her voice.
She notes that she has had increasing dyspnea with exertion over
the last several months, which has acutely worsened within the
last two weeks -- she now becomes very short of breath with 2-3
steps. Her cough and change of voice have accompanied this
diminished functional ability. The patient also notes some BRBPR
a couple of days ago.

IMAGES:
CXR [**8-4**]: There is mild cardiomegaly with increased vascular
markings, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Again noted are
extensive tracheal bronchial wall calcifications.  Pacemaker
battery pack and leads terminate in appropriate positions.
Osseous structures are demineralized.  No focal
opacities concerning for an infectious process.  Non-united
clavicle racture of uncertain acuity by radiological studies,
please correlate with history and physical exam.

ECHO [**8-5**]: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Calcific aortic valve disease with mild stenosis and
mild regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o female w/ pmhx of HTN, parkinson/alzheimer's,on chronic
prednisone (10mg daily)started [**1-/2151**] for temporal arteritis,
who initially presented with fatigue and question of aspiration
found to have leukocytosis, elevated LDH to 5000, and pulm
edema/interstial pattern on [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU with
hypoxemia and resp. distress.  Pt was covered with broad spec
[**Hospital 621**] for PNA, including aspiration and PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] were removed as
culture data came back negative.  Had a d-dimer of 5000 however
in setting of acute illness, no tachycardia, no calf/lower
extremity swelling/tenderness on physical with other
explanations for hypoxemia suspicion was low for PE and this was
not worked up. She was also treated with lasix as needed for
pulmonary edema.

When pt was initially admitted, she was noted to have
transaminitis, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, lactic acidosis,
and hypoalbuminemia that, all together, were concerning for
liver disease, especially since lactate did not compeltely
normalize with fluids. Obtained RUQ u/s which showed targetoid
lesions concerning for mets of unknown primary (otherwise
unremarkable). Decision was made not to pursue diagnostic work
up after discussion with patient and famil
