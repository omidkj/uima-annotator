Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
DOE, weight gain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 yo with PMH significant for ESRD s/p transplant in
[**2170**], CKD with Cr of 2, DM, dCHF presented with DOE,
nonproductive cough and weight gain over the last month. She
presented to her outpatient provider yesterday for these sx's
and was found to desat to 85% on RA with ambulation, so was sent
to the ED.

Pt notes that she has found herself looking bloated (to self and
to sister) and pants felt tighter over last month, though no
dietary changes or indiscretion. Also, for past two weeks, has
had cough at night, non-productive. Very occasionally coughs
during the day. Denies orthopnea, PND, chest pain, fever chills.
Reports she is adherent with all meds. Sleeps with 2 pillows,
this is standard for years. She has never had sx of weight
gain/cough before.

Pt reports that she drinks 4 'jars' of water daily and that this
is steady since 4 years ago, when she was told to stay hydrated
for immunosupression drugs post transplant.
In the ED, CXR showed vascular engorgement. BNP was elevated to
2584.
Patient given nitropaste with some improvement in SOB and
transferred to floor for further management.

ROS:

congestion, sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation,
All other Review of systems as stated above in HPI.

[**2173-11-23**] echo
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2172-8-14**], no major change is evident.

[**2173-11-23**] renal u/s
CONCLUSION: There is new deterioration in vascularization of the
renal
transplant, with markedly decreased diastolic flow, which is now
nearly
absent.The main renal transplant artery and vein are patent. The
most likely
causes for these findings include rejection in the appropriate
clinical
setting, drug toxicity or chronic low flow state.
.

There are two non-obstructing renal calculi.There is no
hydronephrosis.

[**2173-11-25**] CXR
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Mild cardiomegaly persists. The aorta is
calcified and
tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and
unchanged. There is
cephalization of vessels, peribronchial cuffing and interstitial
edema
consistent with CHF. There is no pleural effusion, focal
consolidation or
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
77F with PMH significant for ESRD s/p transplant in [**2170**], CKD
with Cr of 2, DM, diastolic CHF presented with DOE,
nonproductive cough and weight gain over the last month. Wet
crackles halfway up and bilateral LE edema; consistent with
first presentation of decompensated dCHF. Creatinine increase
off baseline on presentation, now returned to baseline,
transplant team following, feels transplant intact.  She was
transferred to the MICU on [**11-27**] in respiratory failure and
managed with BiPAP and diuresis.  She was trasnferred back to
the general medicine service [**11-30**].  Detailed hospital course by
problem.

# ICU course/respiratory failure/hypoxia: Patient admitted with
respiratory failure in the setting of nausea, vomiting and
elevated systolic blood pressures.  Her initial ABG was
7.25/72/130/33 and she was started on BiPAP for acute
respiratory acidosis.  She is a difficult stick and was followed
with VBGs.  Her blood pressure was controlled with metoprolol
and she was diuresed further with a lasix drip.  She was taken
off of BiPAP 11/09 when she was clinically improved.  Her O2
sats were 93-95% on 4L by nasal cannula with a VBG of 7.38/CO2
72/O2 56/HCO3 44 at the time of transfer back to the floor. This
ABG was done while she was completely asymptomatic, and may be
her baseline. Her lung crackles on exam were stable and
unchanged throughout this time.  At the time of discharge, she
still had a mild oxygen requirement (1-2L) to maintain O2 sats
>92%. She had an ABG done prior to discharge which was
7.48/55/64/42 consistent with a metabolic alkalosis with
respiratory compensation likely in the setting of significant
diuresis.  She had a chest CT which was done prior to discharge
as well which showed some ground glass opacities which may be
consistent with pulmonary edema and some bronchial dilation
which may be seen in this age group.  She will be seen in
pulmonary clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 month with PFTs to
evaluate any upderlying lung disease which may be present as
well.  Room air saturations will be checked by VNA but also
should be checked by outpatient providers in clinic as well.

# CAD with recent NSTEMI: The patient had elevated troponins
from 0.01 on admission to 0.29 in the setting of her admission
to the ICU.  She has known CAD s/p stenting.  Her EKG was stable
and she did not have chest pain.  She was started on an NSTEMI
protocol with heparin drip, aspirin 325mg and plavix loading and
cardiology was consulted.  They felt this was mostly due to
cardiac strain and may have been worsening her diastolic failure
but did not feel that intervention was necess
