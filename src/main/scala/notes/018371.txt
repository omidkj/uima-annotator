Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Planned admission for aortic valve replacement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2193-11-4**] - Aortic Valve Replacement (25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
valve) / Sternal plating with Talon System.


History of Present Illness:
51 year old male with no known hx of CAD, admitted to [**Hospital1 5979**] on [**10-26**] with increasing shortness of breath. Patient
reports that he has had worsening DOE for [**5-6**] wks. He states
that it is worse when walking up stairs or on an incline. Also
reports large wt gain but could not quantify an exact amount and
increase swelling of his LE b/l. At the OSH he was ruled out for
MI. An Echo was done which revealed an LVEF 30-35%. He underwent
diuresis with IV lasix and his resp status improved. An ETT was
done that showed inferolateral ischemia. He was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cath. Cath showed patent coronaries, but did show AS
w/ a peak to peak gradient of 80 mmHg and high filling
pressures. ECHO showed severe AS (valve area <0.8cm2), EF of 45%
by ECHO. He was seen by cardiothoracic surgery who recommended
valve replacement with mechanical valve, however recommend
plavix washout therefore surgery was scheduled for Mon [**11-4**]. Pt
requested discharge from the hospital while awaiting surgery and
is now being readmitted for the surgery. Since his discharge two
days ago, pt states that his SOB and LE edema have continued to
improve and he is feeling significantly better than he was on
admission to the OSH. He denies any new or worsening symptoms
including chest pain, fever, chills, or increased
errythema/edema of the lower extremities. He has been taking all
of his medications as prescribed on discharge.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional calf pain. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2193-10-31**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe inferior, inferolateral hypokinesis and
mild anterolateral hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is critical aortic
valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-30**]+)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 349**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2193-11-3**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve stenosis. The next morning he was
taken to the operating room where he underwent and aortic valve
replacement using a 25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical valve. Given his
large habitus, a Talon sternal plating system was used.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. The following morning he awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for
his mechanical valve with a goal INR of 2.5-3.0.  He had acute
renal insufficiency post-operatively with a peak creatinine of
2.4 but was improved at the time of discharge. Heparin was
initiated until his INR was therapeutic.  He was transferred to
the step down unit on post operative day # 3. On the floor he
had adequate urine output with IV lasix, was ambulating in the
halls with assistance and he was tolerating a full diet.  He did
have sternal erythema (no drainage) and was started on kefzol
with a plan for 7 days of Keflex and a wound check in 1 week.
Beta blockers were titrated up and an ACE-I was added for blood
pressure control.    He was receiving coumadin for the
mechanical valve and by post-operative day 8 he was ready for
discharge to home with a therapeutic INR.  His INR will be
followed by his cardiologist [**Male First Name (un) **] Yeghazarians phone
