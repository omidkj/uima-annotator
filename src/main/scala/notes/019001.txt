Pertinent Results:
LENI's: [**2178-8-8**]
Lack of compressibility of the right common femoral vein with
small echogenic focus identified within the lumen, findings
suggestive of a small nonocclusive right common femoral vein
thrombus.

Chest CT: [**2178-8-9**]
1. Small pulmonary emboli within the right upper lobe anterior
segmental pulmonary artery branch and lingular subsegmental
branch.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Multiple small lymph nodes identified within the left
axillary region. Given the axillary lymphadenopathy asymmetry, a
mammogram is recommended to exclude a breast neoplasm.

Abd U/S: [**2178-8-10**]
1) Tiny amount of ascites. Not amenable to paracentesis.
2) Splenomegaly.
3) Right sided pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo F with HCV/cirrhosis/esophageal varices, HIV/AIDS who now
p/w DVT/PE.

1. PE: likely DVT [**2-9**] recent hospitalization for GIB with no
anticoagulation. Pt was originally started on heparin gtt and
coumadin, but then Hct dropped and concerns for a repeat GIB
caused exploration of other options. CIS was consulted and felt
the pt was a good candidate for an IVC filter. This was placed
[**8-12**] in a.m. with no complications and pt was discharged without
anticoagulation.
2. Fevers: Pt spiked a fever to 101.6 while in the unit. Stools
were pos for c diff and Flagyl was started [**8-12**]. Ua, Bcx, Ucx
were neg. Abd U/S showed only small amt of ascites but showed R
pleural effusion  that was determined to be likely subpulmonic
and not tappable. This will be followed up with a repeat CXR as
an outpatient.
3. HepC/Cirrhosis: Regular meds were continued nadolol/
spironolactone/ lasix/ lactulose. Lactulose was stopped when c
diff was found. Pt has RLQ pain which she states is chronic and
is [**2-9**] cirrhosis. Continue Percocet prn for now.
4. Esophageal varices - Stools were guiac'd and were negative.
Continue Famotidine.
5. HIV/AIDS: continue HAART therapy. Continue HSV and PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
6. L axillary LAD seen on CT: mammography done [**2178-3-11**] with no
masses concerning for cancer. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is following. States
HIV related adenopathy is most likely.
7. Anemia: Anemia of chronic disease with cirrhosis. Also pt was
given 4units of blood on last admission which were + for JPK
antibodies- can cause delayed hemolytic transfusion rxn but
hemolysis labs are neg. Hct drop 8/3 26 to 22, was 24 on
recheck. Received 2 units pRBC's and Hct bumped to 33. Guiac
negative. Source unknown - perhaps some element of hemolysis
present that resolved since Hct bumped so nicely. Continue to
monitor Hct as outpt.
8. PPX: Eating, on famotidine.
9. Dispo: Pt requests VNA at home to help with methadone and
other meds. She was seen by PT to help her with exercises to
rebuild her strength.
