Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the medical service intubated. She was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics and stabilized with fluid
resuscitation and supportive care. A general surgery and
endocrinology consult were obtained for her hypercalcemia and
presumed SBO, respectively. She was taken to the operating room
for an exlap with lysis of adhesions and was transferred
intubated to the PACU. She was transferred to the surgical ICU
and cardiology was consulted postoperatively due to prolonged QT
interval and T wave inversions noted on her postop EKG. Her
cardiac enzymes were negative for ischemia and she was stable
overnight. She was maintained on parenteral nutrition
immediately postop. She was extubated POD2 and remained afebrile
and stable. She continued to be followed by endocrinology and
her hypercalcemia slowly resolved with iv fluids and pamidronate
treatment. POD4 she regained bowel function and was started on a
liquid diet which she tolerated. She continued to do well and
was restarted on her home medications and transferred to the
floor. Her diet was advanced to a regular low residue diet. She
did have an episode of emesis on POD5, however, and an NGT was
placed revealing a large amount of gastric output. She remained
NPO with an NGT placed for approximately 2 days where she
tolerated an NGT clamping trial and her NGT was d/c'ed without
complication. Her diet was again advanced which she tolerated
without difficulty. Endocrinology requested a torso CT scan to
r/o malignancy as a cause of the patient's hypercalcemia which
was negative. At the time of discharge, no clear cause of the
patient's initial hypercalcemia was found. She continued to do
well. Her abdominal wound was opened on POD8 revealing brown
sanguinous fluid which was lightly packed. She remained afebrile
and was discharged on POD9 in good condition to rehab.
Endocrinology recommended treatment with Ca++ and vit D upon
discharge. She was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
