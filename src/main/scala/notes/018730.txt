Admission Date: [**2136-6-30**]        Discharge Date: [**2108-4-9**]


Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
Spanish speaking male with a history of hypertension, iron
deficiency anemia, obstructive/restrictive lung disease and
primary biliary cirrhosis who was in his usual state of
health until four days prior to admission when he developed
progressively worsening edema in his lower extremities and
dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to shortness of
breath at rest.  The patient denies any recurrent or current
chest pain and pleuritic chest pain.  He had a stress test in
[**2134-5-10**], consistent with average exercise tolerance and
his last echocardiogram was in [**2134-2-9**], which showed an
ejection fraction over 55 percent.  The patient reports that
he is now unable to climb more than one to two stairs without
becoming short of breath and that he sleeps on a large pillow
at night although he denies that his dyspnea is positional.
In addition, the patient reports milder symptoms of shortness
of breath since being seen in the Emergency Department at
[**Hospital1 69**] in [**2136-2-9**], when he
was diagnosed with a pneumonia/upper respiratory infection.
The patient reports that he has not experienced lower
extremity swelling in the past.  In addition to these
symptoms, the patient reports an unintentional weight loss of
20 pounds in the last year and five pounds in the last month
in addition to generalized fatigue.

The patient denies recent fevers, chills, night sweats,
cough, nausea, vomiting. diarrhea and proximal/distal muscle
weakness.  He was treated in the Emergency Department with 20
mg of intravenous Lasix and had approximately one liter of
clear urine output.  A bedside ultrasound was consistent with
pericardial effusion.  A bedside echocardiogram was performed
and consistent with moderate pericardial effusion, left
atrial compression, right ventricular flap but no
compression, normal flow and ejection fraction with no
abnormalities in the left ventricular wall thickness or
motion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Primary biliary cirrhosis diagnosed by
serologic markers/liver biopsy in [**2132**].

Anemia, baseline hematocrit around 30.0 with MCV around 80,
diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia with a ferritin of 6.3 in
[**2136-5-10**].

Obstructive/restrictive lung disease diagnosed by recent
pulmonary function tests.

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Hypertension.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Echocardiogram in [**2134-2-9**], revealed a left ventricular
ejection fraction over 55 percent, patent foramen ovale,
normal left ventricular wall thickness and motion.

Last stress test in [**2134-5-10**], revealed average functional
exercise tolerance without anginal symptoms.

smoking history.  He has not drank alcohol in six years and
was a previous social drinker only.  The patient denies
history of drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 95, blood pressure
137/66, heart rate 52, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation
94 percent on two liters.  In general, he is awake, alert and
oriented times three in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  The patient has moist mucous membranes.  His
oropharynx is clear.  There is no rhinorrhea or frontal or
maxillary sinus tenderness.  The neck is supple with no
lymphadenopathy, no masses or thyromegaly, jugular venous
pressure is estimated at ten centimeters.  Lungs - The
patient has bibasilar inspiratory crackles without wheezing.
There are mild rales diffusely, no dullness to percussion, no
egophony, good respiratory effort.  Cardiovascular is regular
rate and rhythm, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the inferior
sternal border, no gallops or rubs.  No carotid bruits.
Pulsus paradoxus is around 12 mmHg.  The abdomen is soft,
nontender, mildly distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no
rebound or guarding.  There is evidence of hepatomegaly.
Extremities are warm and well perfused.  Capillary refill is
less than two seconds.  The patient has two plus pitting
edema in the lower extremities bilaterally extending up to
his knees.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Strength is [**6-13**] at elbows and hips bilaterally.
Sensation is intact in all fields.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 6.2, hematocrit
32.3, platelet count 147,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.4,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 33, blood urea nitrogen 11,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 99.  ALT 13, AST 35, alkaline
phosphatase 141, total bilirubin 0.6,  CK 107, CK MB 2.0,
troponin less than 0.01.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Shortness of breath - The patient was
admitted with progressive shortness of breath and bilateral
lower extremity edema and found to have an elevated jugular
venous pressure on examination.  A bedside ultrasound in the
Emergency Department was consistent with pericardial effusion
and a bedside echocardiogram revealed left atrial compression
and a moderate pericardial effusion.  The patient was
admitted to the general medical service and his pulsus
paradoxus was monitored.  A cardiology consultation was
obtained on admission and performed a pericardiocentesis on
[**2136-7-2**].  Pericardial access was obtained on the first
attempt of the xiphoid with yellowish serosanguinous fluid.
An echocardiogram after 300cc of fluid removed showed a
smaller pericardial effusion and ultimately 600cc of bloody
serosanguinous fluid that appeared yellow in the tubing was
eventually removed with improvement in pericardial and right
atrial pressures.  The patient was followed by the Coronary
Care Unit team for several days.  Given continuous output
from the pericardial drain, cardiac surgery team was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and performed a pericardial window on [**2136-7-6**].
Studies on the pericardial fluid were negative for infection
and cytology.  The patient had a normal TSH.  The patient
notably has a positive [**Doctor First Name **] with a titre of 1:40.  Looking
through the previous records, the patient had a previous
titre from [**2132-5-10**], of 1:640.  The significance of this is
unclear especially given that other workup has been negative.
The etiology of the patient's pericardial effusion at this
point is considered idiopathic.  The patient will be
evaluated by a repeat echocardiogram and cardiac surgery is
scheduled to remove the chest tube they placed during
pericardial window placement.

Primary biliary cirrhosis - The patient is noted to have a
history of primary biliary cirrhosis and was asymptomatic
with stable liver function tests and coagulation studies
throughout his hospitalization.  He was continued on Nadolol
and Ursodiol throughout this admission.  The patient also has
a history of grade I varices and esophagitis/gastritis and
was continued on proton pump inhibitor .

Anemia - The patient was admitted with a history of iron
deficiency anemia.  He had a stable hematocrit throughout his
hospitalization and was continued on iron replacement with
Vitamin C for improved absorption of iron.

Hypertension - The patient was noted to be hemodynamically
stable and normotensive throughout his admission.  He was
continued on Norvasc 5 mg p.o. once daily.

Pulmonary - The patient was admitted with a history of
obstructive/restrictive lung disease by recent pulmonary
function tests.  The etiology of his shortness of breath as
discussed previously was considered likely secondary to his
pericardial effusion.  After pericardiocentesis and
pericardial window placement, the patient's shortness of
breath improved throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization.  He was continued on Albuterol and
Fluticasone inhalers p.r.n. for shortness of breath.
