Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10010**] is a very pleasant 79 yo M with a past medical
history of afib on coumadin, htn, dmII who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] emergency department with a one day history of oral
bleeding. He was initially admitted to the medical intensive
care unit on [**2196-3-14**] for concern of GI bleed. In the ICU his
bleeding stopped his hematocrit stabilized around 30 from
baseline of 40.  After a thorough evaluation he was transferred
to a regular medicine floor on [**2196-3-15**].  Oral surgery was
consulted, surgery was planned for [**3-18**].  Pt's hematocrit was
monitored daily with no change and patient experienced no
further bleeding.  On [**3-18**], he had three teeth pulled.  Oral
surgery recommended a 7 day course of antibiotics as well as
peridex rinses.  They also recommended that patient follow up
with a dentist given poor dentition.

In the setting of acute bleed, pts antihypertensive agents were
held temporarily as was coumadin.  Blood pressure medications
were restarted prior to discharge.  Coumadin was held.  Pt was
instructed to not take coumadin until his visit with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**3-23**]. At that time if Hct is stable, there would be no concern
for resuming coumadin.

During his hospitalization, patinet was also noted to have poor
air movement and wheezing.  He was started on a 5 day prednisone
burst.  He has no history of COPD that he is aware and is not on
any inhalers at home.  Strong consideration for PFTs should be
given as outpatient.
