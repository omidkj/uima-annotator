HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a
60-year-old gentleman (status post orthotopic liver
transplant on [**2200-6-16**] for end-stage renal disease
secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis).

He was discharged from [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2200-7-10**] to [**Hospital3 **] Center in stable
condition.

A couple of days ago, while undergoing a laboratory workup,
he was noted to have increased liver function tests, and the
patient was scheduled to have a liver biopsy done yesterday
(on [**2200-7-16**]) by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].  His hematocrit prior to
procedure was 26, and after the biopsy a repeat hematocrit
was 21.

He was sent to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2200-7-17**] to be evaluated. His
hematocrit upon presentation to the Emergency Department was
25, but he was also found to have a potassium level of 5.8
and a questionable ST elevation on electrocardiogram.  He was
admitted for evaluation of this.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
2.  Acute renal failure.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Grade II esophageal varices.
5.  Portal hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post orthotopic liver
transplant on [**2200-6-16**]; status post repeat exploration
for an intra-abdominal hematoma.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Neoral 250 mg p.o. twice per day.
 2.  Prednisone 15 mg p.o. once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of ethanol abuse.
He is married.  He denies tobacco use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denied
any chest pain, dyspnea, or any pain.  No nausea or vomiting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
revealed vital signs with a temperature of 98.7, blood
pressure was 103/93, heart rate was 67, respiratory rate was
16, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.  In general,
he was comfortable.  In no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The neck was supple.  There
was 1 cm of jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sounds and second heart sounds.  The lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at
the bases.  There were no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Bowel sounds
were present.  The wound was well healed with staples in
place.  The biopsy site was without bleeding.  Extremity
examination revealed the extremities were well perfused with
1+ edema.  No cyanosis.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  The right groin had an
area of ecchymosis where a prior line was removed and a
pseudoaneurysm was resected.  Neurologic examination revealed
the patient was alert and oriented times three.  He followed
commands.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 4, hematocrit was 25.1,
and platelets were 149.  Sodium was 135, potassium was 5.6,
blood urea nitrogen was 33, and creatinine was 1.5.  His
coagulations revealed INR was 1.2, prothrombin time was 13.2,
and partial thromboplastin time was 27.2.  A cyclosporin
level on [**2200-7-16**] was noted to be 635.  The patient's
first set of creatine kinases were 21.  Troponin was 0.25.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An ultrasound was performed
which revealed a 2.8 hematoma at the biopsy site.  There was
a normal Duplex of the liver graft.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a
60-year-old gentleman status post orthotopic liver transplant
on [**2200-6-16**].

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Center
on [**2200-7-10**].  The patient was initially thought to have
a drop in his hematocrit, status post a biopsy, but his
hematocrit was back to baseline at 25.

At that point, a Cardiology workup was initiated for a
potassium value of 5.6.  The patient was initially transfused
2 units of packed red blood cells and put on telemetry.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled.  Cardiology evaluated the
patient and felt that the anemia likely led to this small
troponin leak, revealing underlying coronary artery disease.
However, the patient was entirely asymptomatic and with the
correction of anemia he felt that a cardiac workup stress
test was not urgent.  They did recommend placing the patient
on a beta blocker and scheduling Mr. [**Known lastname **] for a stress
test early next week at [**Hospital3 **] Center.  In
addition, they recommended watching for changes in
electrolytes; especially, his potassium level.

After a blood transfusion 2 units of packed red blood cells,
the patient's hematocrit increased to 27.3.  On [**7-18**], his
creatine kinase values went down to 18 and 18, and his next
two troponin levels were 0.2 and 0.19.  His potassium was
5.2.

On hospital day two, on [**7-19**], the patient was noted to have
a very stable hematocrit at 28.4 and a potassium level of
4.7.  The patient was found to be stable and improving, and
it was decided to discharge the patient back to
rehabilitation today ([**7-19**]).

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was back to [**Hospital3 1761**] Center.

11.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. twice per day (hold for a heart
rate of less than 60 or systolic blood pressure of less than
100).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic
(telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]).
2.  The patient was currently to return to [**Hospital3 6373**] Center where he will undergo a cardiac stress
test next week to further evaluate any underlying cardiac
disease.
3.  Laboratory work were to be monitored on a daily basis for
