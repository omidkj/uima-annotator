Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2136-6-29**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left
internal mammary to diagonal, vein grafts to obtuse marginal and
PDA) and Mitral Valve Repair(28mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Annuloplasty
Band)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23340**] is a 75 year old male with known coronary
disease, recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with unstable angina. He
ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction at that time and
underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease. Prior to cath, was loaded with
Plavix. He subsequently underwent cardiac surgical evaluation
and coronary revascularization surgery was delayed secondary to
Plavix load. He was eventually discharged on medical therapy.
Unfortunately, he presented one day after discharge with rest
angina. He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

Past Medical History:
- Coronary Artery Disease with history of recent MI
- Prior PTCA to RCA [**2119**], [**2120**]
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Prostate Cancer, s;p Prostatecomy
- Appendectomy
- Ganglionic Cyst Removal, Right Hand


Social History:
He smokes cigars for about 30 years, but he quit 25 years ago.
He drinks socially, up to two drinks per day (usually [**1-3**]
glasses of wine/scoth at night).  He is a retired [**Location (un) 86**] police
officer.  He does not get any regular physical exercise.



Family History:
Denies premature coronary artery disease.

[**2136-6-27**] Carotid Ultrasound: There is a less than 40% right ICA
stenosis and a 40% to 59% left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow
in both vertebral arteries.
[**2136-6-28**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is elongated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal and mid-inferior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23340**] was admitted and underwent further preoperative
evaluation which included a carotid ultrasound and a
transthoracic echocardiogram(please see result section). He
remained stable on intravenous Heparin and intravenous
Nitroglycerin. His preoperative course was otherwise
unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. On [**6-29**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral
valve repair. For surgical details, please see separate dictated
operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to the
CSRU for monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. He maintained stable
hemodynamics and weaned from intravenous therapy without
difficulty. His CSRU course was otherwise uneventful and he was
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one. He experienced
brief episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His atrial
fibrillation was treated with Amiodarone and he converted back
to normal sinus rhythm. As he developed significant conversion
pauses while on amiodarone, this was  discontinued. He was
transfused 2 units PRBCs on [**7-4**] for postoperative anemia. As he
had no further pauses, his pacing wires removed on POD #5. He
experienced recurrent atrial fibrillation and he was restarted
amiodarone. Coumadin and heparin were started for
anticoagulation. The physical therapy service worked with him
daily for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. Slowly his INR became within therapeutic range and his
heparin was discontinued. Mr. [**Known lastname 23340**] required steady
diuresis for fluid overload. He continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on [**2136-7-8**]. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician
as an outpatient. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will manage his coumadin dosing
for a target INR of 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
