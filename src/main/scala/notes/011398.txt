Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker insertion


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo F who presents with dizziness in the
setting of poor PO intake for several weeks. Per her daughter,
patient's PO intake has been decreased since hospitalization for
a perforated ulcer in [**Month (only) **] (has lost over 25 lbs in that
time period). Over the past several days, patient has been dizzy
and weak at home, and eating and drinking even less than
baseline. On the day prior to admission, felt nauseous after
eating a hamburger for lunch and vomited x1; resolved and was
able to tolerated seafood chowder for dinner. The morning of
admission, patient felt increasingly weak and dizzy,
particularly with movement, sitting or standing, and called EMS.
FS was 200 and EMS found her to be in a junctional bradycardia
and she was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T97.4 HR42 BP155/47 RR18 O2
sat100% 4L NC. In the emergency room, EKG showed a junctional
bradyarrhythmia with a rate of 41 and increased RBBB from prior.
She was given 0.5 mg atropine for bradycardia with no
significant effect (HR 36-38). Initial labs were remarkable for
a creatinine of 3.7 (baseline 1.5-1.6), BUN 87, K 6.2, and
digoxin level of 2.0. CXR showed mild fluid overload. She was
seen by cardiology and toxicology and received aspirin 324,
digibind 6 vials, 10 units insulin, 1 amp D50, Na bicarb 150 mEq
in 1L D5W, and kayexelate 15 g. She received 5 mg of vitamin K
PO for her INR of 3.2 and was admitted to the CCU for further
management and monitoring. Prior to transfer VS were HR 37, BP
129/40, RR 12, O2 sat 100% on 3L.
.
In the CCU, patient denies any h/o syncopal events, chest pain,
SOB, fevers, chills, cough, or diarrhea. She does report
increasing LE edema and one episode of possible visual
hallucination (saw a person whom she spoke to who did not reply,
and subsequently disappeared). Reports compliance w/ all of her
medications.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, though her family feels her speech may be slightly more
slurred than usual. She denies h/o deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, or syncope.

STUDIES:
EKG: (8:57 AM) Junctional bradycardia at 41 bpm w/ slightly
increased RBBB from baseline. LAD suggestive of LAFB.
.
EKG: (13:25) Junctional bradycardia at 43 bpm w/ RBBB closer to
baseline, stable LAD.
.
CXR: [**6-22**]
1. Confluent lower lobe ill defined opacities likely represent
pulmonary edema however infectous process cannot be ruled out.
Recommend repeat radiograph after diuresis to assess for
resolution of opacities 2. Mild congestive heart failure with
bilateral left greater than right small pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**6-23**]
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient after pacemaker
placement
through the left cephalic vein.
The left-sided pacemaker leads terminate in the expected
location of right
atrium and right ventricle. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. The
patient is in mild interstitial pulmonary edema associated with
bilateral
pleural effusions, but grossly appears to be unchanged since the
prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F w/ h/o AF, DM, and HTN presenting with dizziness and
weakness in the setting of new junctional bradycardia.
.
# Junctional bradycardia: New from baseline and concerning for
digitalis toxicity in setting of clinical picture of nausea,
vomiting, and hallucination, as well as dig level of 2.0,
hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Bradycardia, junctional rhythms,
atrial tachyarrhythmias with nodal blockade are some of the most
common manifestations of digitalis toxicity. EKG does not show
some of the classic changes associated with digitalis - the
"effect" including scooped ST segments and T wave changes,
however these tend to be associated more with chronic use than
acute toxicity. Digitalis toxicity could be secondary to new
renal failure. However, received digibin without significant
change in EKG, which would be expected. This raises concern for
underlying conduction disease/sinus node dysfunction therefore
decision made to undergo pacemaker placement ([**Company 1543**] dual-ch
ppm via L cephalic) on [**6-22**]. Her INR was reversed for the
procedure with 5 mg PO vitamin K and 2 units FFP. Pacer
interrogating on [**6-23**] and demonstrated appropriate function. Low
dose metoprolol restarted on [**6-23**]. Keflex was started [**6-23**] with
plan for 2 day treatment course to p
