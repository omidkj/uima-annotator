History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 yo F with history of chronic hepatitis B who
is presenting with increasing syncopal episodes over the last
three weeks.  The patient reports that she had first syncopal
episodes about a year ago; she had a normal EKG and stress test

been lasting longer than normal.  Also reports that the longer
she is blacked out for, the more intense her heart palpitations
and heart racing she feels.  No association with standing
up/positional change. Episodes occur when walking or when
sitting.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 yo F with history of chronic hepatitis B who
is presenting with increasing syncopal episodes over the last
three weeks, transferred to CCU after 60 seconds of VT and
possibility of Brugada syndrome. However, found to have no
structural heart abnormalities on ECHO.
.
# syncope/ recurrent idiopathic VT:  The patient's ECHO did not
show any evidence of structural heart disease, making Brugada
syndrome unlikely.  EP study was performed and the patient is
now status post right ventricular outflow tract ablation.  Prior
to the study, beta blockers were held.  She was monitored on
tele and her lytes wer repleted aggressively.  The patient had
intermittent, self resolving, limited runs of VT while in the
CCU.  However, post ablation, her heart rhythm normalized.  Post
procedure ECHO was normal, without any evidence of pericardial
effusion.  The patient was set up with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor
upon discharge, and she was instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# cough: Pt reports having a cough productive of green sputum.
Denies any fevers, likely bronchitis.  A CXR was done showing no
acute infiltrate; no antibiotics were started.
.
# hepatitis B: chronic, not on any medications
.
# dirty UA:  The patient was found to have dirty UA with large
leuks and 17 WBC.  However, because she was completely
asymptomatic, no treatment was initiated.
.
Transitional Issues:
- The patient is to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an out patient re:
[**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts monitoring, which she was discharged with.
