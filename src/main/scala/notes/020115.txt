Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
79 F with a history of asthma vs. COPD (no definite diagnosis)
and restrictive pattern on PFTs who presents with acute
worsening of dyspnea x 2 days. She has been on O2 at home since
an admission approximately one year ago, with occasional "good"
days off but generally using oxygen every night and most of
every day. She also has a home nebulizer which she is prescribed
to use up to three times a day, but for the past few weeks has
been using at least 3-4 times per day. About one month ago she
had a URI characterized by copius mucous production, cough and
rhinorrhea. The cough has persisted, but is +/- productive at
this time.

She was placed on BiPap temporarily. She received solumedrol
125, combivent, azithromycin, CTX. ABG immediately after
starting Bipap was 7.26/74/286/35. On transfer to the MICU,
vitals were 64, 167/90, 26, 100% on neb, NC at 4L.
.
On arrival to the floor, she is with her daughters. She reports
feeling some improvement with BiPap in the ED.

[**2200-2-23**] 4:56 pm BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):
.
[**2200-2-24**] 1:24 am MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2200-2-25**]**

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2200-2-25**]):
      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
.
[**2200-2-24**] 1:24 am URINE     Site: CATHETER
      URINE CX ADDED ON [**2200-2-24**] AT 1510.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2200-2-25**]**

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2200-2-24**]):
      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.
      Test performed only on suprapubic and kidney aspirates
received in a
      syringe.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2200-2-25**]):    NO GROWTH.

ECHO: [**2200-2-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2199-1-28**], the RV systolic function may have
slightly improved. Otherwise, no big change.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2200-2-23**]

COMPARISON: [**2199-11-15**] as well as a CTA chest from [**2199-1-29**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: 79-year-old woman with acute dyspnea, question
acute
process in the chest.

FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Low
lung volumes and patient rotation to the left, somewhat limit
the evaluation. Allowing for this, there is no focal
consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Mild left basilar
plate-like atelectasis is noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
appears grossly stable. Bony structures appear intact.

IMPRESSION: Mild left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise,
unremarkable study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 79 F with a history of "asthma or COPD" and
restrictive defect on PFTs who presents with 2 days of worsening
dyspnea. She was admitted to the MICU and called out the
following day. The rest of her course is described below by
system.
.
#. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient's underlying pulmonary
physiology is somewhat unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] her restrictive defect on
PFTs, she is likely to have a component of obesity-related
restrictive lung disease (possibly also related to chronic
hypoventillation/OSA). CXR is notable for a small opacity at
left base which is new from prior and may represent infection
(vs. atelectasis). It seems likely that infection (URI vs.
bacterial pneumonia) superimpose
