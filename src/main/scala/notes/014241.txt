Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
86 y/o female with CHF (EF 25-30%), CKD/ESRD on HD (last
dialyzed [**2163-7-22**]) brought in by ambulance [**2-7**] SOB.  Per pt, the
onset of the SOB has been since the middle of the week, with
unclear precipitant.  Her SOB is markedly worse at night, as she
has 3+ pillow orthopnea.  Of note, during her Wed and Friday HD
sessions, she states she was placed on oxygen by nasal cannula,
which is new for her.  She awoke from sleep on Sat AM with
shortness of breath, without chest pain.  She denies cough and
fever.  She also reports decreased PO intake for the past 3
months with 30 lb weight loss over 3-4 months, as "food has no
appeal."
.
In the ER, pt afebrile, 139/59, 66, 97-99% 3L NC.  Was hypoxic
at 90% on RA, with RR 40, and fluid overloaded on CXR.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, pt resting comfortably in bed on 3L
NC.
.
ROS: as per HPI.  Of note, pt is not on home O2.  She states she
feels cold "all the time."

Other Studies:
[**2163-7-24**] EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with intraventricular
conduction defect consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch
block. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Cannot exclude
prior inferior wall myocardial infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2163-7-11**] no diagnostic interim change.
.
[**2163-7-29**] CXR: In comparison with previous study of [**7-27**], there
is again
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with continued small
bilateral effusions in a patient with intact sternal sutures and
previous CABG and valve replacement. There is somewhat
ill-defined areas of increased opacification at the right base,
the right mid zone, and the left base in the retrocardiac
region. Although all this could represent atelectatic change, in
view of the clinical history, the possibility of a supervening
consolidation cannot be definitely excluded.
.
[**2163-7-30**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Possible aortic valve
vegetation. Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended to
diagnose endocarditis if clinically indicated.
.
[**2163-8-1**] TEE: IMPRESSION: Technically suboptimal study. No
definite evidence of valvular vegetation. Well seated mitral
annuloplasty ring with moderate mitral regurgitation. Focal
thickening of the aortic valve without aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior intraoperative study (images reviewed)
of [**2162-8-16**], the findings are similar.
.
[**2163-8-6**] CXR: Compared with [**2163-8-5**], the CHF findings have
improved, but remain present.
1) Interstitial edema, possibly with small alveolar component
2) Bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
consolidation.
3) Stable left retrocardiac density. Possibility of a pneumonic
infiltrate at the left base cannot be entirely excluded.
.
Blood cultures were positive for VISA.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 y/o WF with PMH significant for ESRD on HD, systolic CHF with
EF 25-30%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation initially admitted to
hospital with CHF exacerbation, now with VISA line related
bacteremia (6/6 bottles).
.
# VISA bacteremia/sepsis: Patient spiked fever on [**7-27**], blood
cultures drawn which grew GPCs in pairs and clusters and was
intially started on vancomycin. GPCs speciated as VISA and
patient switched to daptomycin. She had a TEE negative for any
vegetations. Patient's RIJ HD line suspected as infectious
source. This line was removed on [**2163-8-2**] and switched over a
wire given concerns that patient would not agree to additional
procedure for line placement. However, when blood cx from
[**2163-8-2**] cont to grow VISA the line was removed on [**8-4**] and
patient given 72 hr line holiday. She had a new tunnelled HD
cath placed on [**2163-8-8**] (this was re-sited and placed on the left)
as well as a right sided PICC line placed. Blood cultures have
remained no growth since [**2163-8-8**]. Patient was followed by the
infectious disease service who has recommended a 4 week course
of daptomycin ([**Date range (3) 106288**]). She will need weekly CK checked
while on Daptomycin. Patient has scheduled follow up with ID.
