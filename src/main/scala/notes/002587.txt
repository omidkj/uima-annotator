dyspnea, IVIG-mediated ATN

none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 year-old r handed male with PMHx significant for CAD
s/p MI x3 w/ stent, HTN, afib admitted for IVIG therapy related
to recently diagnosed motor neuropathy.
.
- Following history adapted from neuromuscular fellow note of
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] -
.
Pt states that for a couple of years, he has had some difficulty

reaching things on high shelves. He began to have to use both
his
hands to lift anything as heavy as a plate from a high shelf. He

did not notice any other problems at that time. In [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2115**],
he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In [**Month (only) 404**] of this
year, he began to notice some dyspnea on exertion while lifting
his paraplegic wife. At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] he noticed he could
no
longer breathe while lying flat. He went to [**State 108**] in [**Month (only) 956**]
and shortly afterward developed severe shortness of breath and
lower extremity edema. He was hospitalized in [**State 108**] and given
a
diagnosis of a left lower lobe infiltrate and started on
diuretics and antibiotics.
.
After discharge his symptoms did not improve. He returned to
[**Location 86**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with worsening orthopnea,
pitting edema and shortness of breath. He was given a diagnosis
of diastolic heart failure with an elevated BNP. There was no
evidence of MI. He was cardioverted during admission and
aggressively diuresed in the CCU. Amiodarone was added. He
continued to be hypoxic and require supplemental oxygen. TTE
showed EF 50%.
.
He was discharged to rehabilitation. Since then, he has
continued
to need supplemental oxygen. He has continued orthopnea and
dyspnea on exertion and always sleeps in a chair. He walks with
a
walker now to carry his oxygen tank and provide a chair if he
needs to rest. He can walk around his house without the walker,
and admits he often dosen't use the nasal cannula at home. He
has
been unable to get a chest CT due to the inability to lay flat.

.
In addition to the breathing problems, a couple of months ago he

also developed paresthesias and numbness in the fourth and fifth

digits of his left hand. This included the palm and the dorsal
surface of the fourth and fifth digits. He also notes weakness
of
the left hand, particulary his grip. His fourth and fifth
fingers
"feel big," and when touched feel as though something is between

his fingers and the stimulus. He denies neck, wrist and elbow
pain.
.
He denies weakness in the lower extremities. He also denies
numbness and paresthesias in the lower extremities. He has not
noticed any rippling muscles or twitching. He has had chronic
lower extremity cramps at night for years, but this is
unchanged.
He denies trouble speaking or swallowing, and denies double
vision or increased weakness at the end of the day.
.
A few weeks ago, he had PFTs, which showed an FVC 29% predicted,

FEV1 32% predicted. The FEV1/FVC ratio was 111% predicted, which

is elevated. The test was consistent with a restrictive lung
process. He also had a moderately reduced DLCO.
.
There is no history of fevers, chills, chest pain, rashes
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, incoordination, change in
vision, change in speech and swallowing.

Pertinent Results:
[**Doctor First Name 2841**] - electrophysiologic findigs most c/w multifocal motor
neuropathy w/ conduction block, affecting bilateral median
nerves and ulnar nerve.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 yo man with multifocal motor neuropathy, CAD, HTN,
OSA, s/p PCI, hyperlipidemia, restrictive lung disease
(diagnosed [**2117-6-25**] with FVC of 34% predicted)who initially
presented with slowly progressive dyspnea and orthopnea over six
months.  The patient also reported weakness of his left hand
over the last year.  On exam the patient was found to have
proximal muscle weakness in his upper and lower extremities.  He
was also noted to have a numbness from his elbows to his finger
tips bilaterally with weakness of his left 4th and 5th digits.
He also had largely absent reflexes. The patient's [**Month/Day/Year 2841**] study
from [**2117-6-15**] suggested his defecits are from a multifocal motor
neuropathy with conduction block.  He also seems to have an
ulnar neuropathy.  The pt was admitted for an elective 5 day
course of IVIG for this motor neuropathy.  After administration
of the IVIG, the pts creatinine increased from 0.9 on [**7-6**] to
1.4 on [**7-8**], to 5.4 on [**7-10**], and to a peak of 7.4 on [**7-11**].  The
pt was transferred to the MICU on [**7-11**] for this worsening renal
function thought to be secondary to IVIG-mediated ATN, oliguria,
and increasing SOB with a mild increase in O2 requirement.  In
the MICU, the pt was followed by renal.  His Bumex was D/C'd,
Aspirin and Indomethecin were also D/C'd.  Renal US and CXR were
obtained. Renal US showed no obstruction.  CXR show no pulmonary
congestion. Prior to transfer to the floor, the pt was given
Lasix 120 mg IV x1 and chlorothiazide 500 mg IV x1.  The pt
diuresed 2L in response to these doses, and then he further
autodiuresed 3-4 L each day subsequently.  It was felt the
