Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with concern for aortic thrombus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ MMP who initially presented to [**Hospital1 4086**] w/ CP, SOB
and back pain. She had a leukocytosis (wbc of 19.8) and a +UA.
She was started on levofloxacin and ruled out for an MI. A VQ
scan was done which showed low prob for a PE. A CT angio was
significant for an intramural hematoma of the ascending aorta
from the aortic valve to the origin of the innominate artery.
Additionally, the thoracic aorta was ectatic w/ multifocal
calcification, noncalcified plague, focal mural thrombus was
present in 2 locations in the descending thoracic aorta. Also
noted was a small-mod L pleural effusion w/ atelectasis
bilaterally at the bases. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care. She was admitted to the vascular service due to
the aortic thrombi. It was determined that the thrombi are
asymptomatic and that surgery is not currently indicated. Abx
(levo [**8-31**] or 24?->ceftrioxone->cipro stopped [**9-5**]) were
continued for the UTI. While at [**Hospital1 **], she developed new afib/rvr
was loaded with amiodarone + amio gtt (loaded with 2g) and
transitioned to po amio. Again pt had AF/RVR started on dilt
drip transitioned to dilt po. She has continued to have SOB. An
echo done on [**9-2**] was significant for [**2-9**]+MR, 4+TR, RV
dilatation and depressed free wall contractility and a preserved
EF. Patient transferred to medicine for furthur evaluation.

Echo [**2107-9-2**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No
right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
.
CXR [**2107-9-5**]: 1) Cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.
2) Left greater than right pleural effusion with underlying
collapse and/or consolidation.  3) Compared with [**2107-9-3**], the
CHF findings appear more pronounced.The bibasilar opacities are
unchanged.
.
CXR [**9-6**] In comparison with the study of [**9-4**], the degree of
left pleural effusion has somewhat decreased. Cardiomegaly with
some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure persists. Relative
[**Name (NI) 95365**] raises the possibility of pericardial effusion or
underlying cardiomyopathy. Prominence of central pulmonary
vessels suggests some pulmonary hypertension. No acute focal
pneumonia.
.
CXR [**9-7**] - Since yesterday, cardiomegaly is stable and vascular
congestion cleared. Left moderate pleural effusion slightly
enlarged and right small-to- moderate pleural effusion is
unchanged. Possibly enlarged pulmonary arteries are unchanged.
The aorta is tortuous. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no
other change since yesterday.
.
UE ultrasound [**9-7**] - Clot in right cephalic vein with no
extension of clot into other vessels.
.
Ct chest with contrast:
1. Acute dissection of the ascending aorta associated with acute
progressing intramural hematoma. Dissection does not extend to
the aortic valve and ends before the origin of great vessels.
2. Increase thrombus in the descending aorta. Severely
atheromatous and dilated aorta.
3. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis, most prominent on the right.
4. Enlarged pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
5. Severe cardiomegaly.
6. Large hiatal hernia and dilatation of the esophagus.
7. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ mmp incld DMII, htn, emphysema, ILD, now with aortic
thrombus/dissection which is progressiving, new a.fib w/RVR,
leukocytosis, previous UTI (treated w/ cipro), pleural
effusions, worsening tricuspid regurg, now CMO.

# Comfort measure only
After many discussions with family, patient made comfort
measures only after exploring that only way that patient will
get better is with extensive and very risky surgery that family
and patient does not want.  Pain and palliative care was called
to help with pain management.  In addition, the geriatrics team
has been very helpful.  Telemetry was discontinued. In additon,
discontinued overnight vital signs as well as subcutaneous
heparin and aspirin.  Patient was started on pain medication
first with liquid morphine, however there was concern by the
family that this was making the patient too confused, so changed
to oxycontin.  Suspect that patient not acutely delirious, and
that confusion likely a combination of underlying medical
problem as well as medication. In addition, started patient on
zyprexa daily and PRN. Pt's beta-blocker was continued as rate
control will likely help with symptoms.
We stopped checking new labs, and vitals were taken only with
concern for acute worsening.  Patient was started on aggressive
bowel regimen because on oral narcotics, was also disimpacted
one time.
.
# Atrial fibrillation/Aortic dissection
Atrial fibrillation was new on this admission, patient has a
history of palpitations but no known hx of afib. Here patient
noted to have afib w/ RVR to the 120s.  Pt was initially rate
controlled with amiodarone and diltiazem and then these
medications were discontinued and Metoprolol was started.
Metoprolol was uptitrated as tolerated by HR and BP for rate
control.  Currently on 37.5 mg PO QID.  As per the CT scan,
aortic dissection appears to be progressing, and there is
obviously large risk of rupture at any time.  However, patient
and family do  not want surgery.  As above, patient made comfort
measures only.  Checked TSH on admission which was normal, so
unlikely that playing any role in new onset of atrial
fibrillation
.
# SOB:
Patient has had consistent shortness of breath throughout
admis
