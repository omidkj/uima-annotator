History of Present Illness:
(Pt is intubated and sedated on arrival to the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the
history is provided by his significant other, [**Name (NI) 401**]). Mr. [**Known lastname **]
is a 42 year-old male with a history of HIV infection and Lyme
disease who presents w/ a diffuse erythematous rash which
started today at 11am. The rash was first noticed last week. He
went to his PCP's office on [**2140-9-15**] when he first noted the
rash. It was described as a generalized, macular papular rash on
his torso and extremities. It was thought to be due to dapsone
(which was being used for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]) and it was
recommended that he d/c dapsone. He had been on dapsone since
mid-[**Month (only) 216**]. For PCP prophylaxis, he was then given inhaled
pentamidine (on [**9-15**]) without any problems. The patient was
advised to use benadryl for symptom relief. The following
weekend ([**Date range (1) 9879**]), the patient continued to have what his
partner described as an erythematous, "spotty" rash all over his
body. It was not itchy, but the patient took benadryl and
claritin RTC to help with the rash, without much improvement. He
also stopped taking Atripla (his previous HAART medication) and
began taking Kaletra and Truvada (the new HAART regimen which
had been prescribed by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2140-9-8**]). He was noted to have
intermittent fevers to 101 and "heart palpitations". His partner
denied any symptoms of night sweats, chills, SOB, chest pain,
cough, URI sx, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea. He
was noted to be fatigued and his partner states that the patient
"slept for the last 3 days". By Tuesday ([**9-20**]), the patient's
rash had resolved and he went to work without any complaints. He
was noted to have more energy that evening and slept well.
However, upon waking on [**2140-9-21**], he noted to his partner that he
felt poorly but tried to go to work. He also told his partner
that he was beginning a new medication today for pneumonia but
it was unclear what medication this was. The patient then
presented to the ER for further evaluation.
.
In the ER, initial VS were T 98.6, BP 103/51, HR 110, RR 18,
sats of 99% on RA. His initial complaint was of an allergic
reaction at work -he noted that his skin was warm, dry, flushed
and his eyes were red and itchy. He quickly then dropped his BP
to 74/41. He was bolused w/ IVF and started on vancomycin. His
temp started to rise and he was given ibuprofen. IVF were
continually bolused and CTX was given. His SBP remained in the
70s so he was put on dopamine through a peripheral IV while a
central line was placed. He was then switched to levophed. He
then became hypoxic with increasing O2 requirement and was
intubated in the ER using etomidate/succinylcholine. He received
a total of 5.5L of NS and had 80cc UOP (a foley had been
placed). Dermatology was consulted in the ER and had a ddx of
drug hypersensitivity, viral exanthem, or infection. They did
not feel that this was SJS.
.
Per the PCP notes at [**Name9 (PRE) 778**], the patient had stopped Atripla on
[**9-10**] due to a rash and had begun on Kaletra/Truvada on [**9-11**]. The
rash was felt to be self-limited as it resolved with
discontinuation of Atripla. He also noted that he had continued
on the dapsone up until [**2140-9-17**]. He commented on resolution of
the rash, but did note a HA over the weekend that was [**8-26**].
Given pt's intubated status and conflicting story from his
partner, it is unclear what meds the patient was receiving and
when he had discontinued others.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted with a similar chief complaint
in [**3-23**]. He presented with fever, acute renal failure, anemia
and joint pain. He was diagnosed with acute HIV infection (VL
>100,000K, CD4 of 180) and the remainder of the infectious w/u
was negative. ASO titer was positive and complement levels were
negative, but the patient was treated with a full course of
augmentin anyways. Anemia was felt to be due to iron deficiency
and outpatient workup was recommended. He then presented 2 days
after discharge with fever to 103.8, "red eyes", and rash. He
had a lactate of 2.8 at the time. He was initially treated with
CTX, vanco and acyclovir, had an LP (neg for meningitis), head
CT (neg for bleed), and CXR (no infiltrate). His abx were
initially switched to CTX and azithromycin. Lyme antibody was
positive so his antibiotics were switched to doxycycline for a
30 day course. He was discharged on cipro eye drops and
atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2140-10-10**] 10:23 AM
CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is dramatic
improvement in the bilateral effusions with minimal residual
bilateral atelectasis when compared to the previous study. The
central airways are patent to segmental levels bilaterally.
There is a small hyper attenuated lesion in the right middle
lobe of the lung, which is likely a tiny calcified granuloma.
There are small axillary lymph nodes under 1.5 cm as seen in the
previous study. There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal
lymph nodes. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver, spleen,
adrenal glands, pancreas, abdominal loops of small bowel are
unremarkable. There is resolved ascites when compared to the
last study. There is minimal gallbladder wall thickening likely
due to third spacing. Tiny paraortic lymph nodes noted, not
significantly enlarged by strict CT criteria.

PELVIS: Mild thickening of the right colonic wall, likely due to
third spacing. A co
