REPORTS:

[**2184-3-5**] CXR AP:
Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray. On today's film
the lung
volumes are slightly lower. Some upper zone re-distribution is
present but
the costophrenic angles are sharp. Heart remains enlarged.
Appearances
suggest mild failure.

RENAL U/S [**2184-3-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Left renal cyst.
3. New small-to-moderate ascites throughout the abdomen.

ECHO [**2184-3-8**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= XX %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global
hypokinesis. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Moderate
to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension
and tricuspid regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with CAD, CHF EF30%, HTN, afib on coumadin who presents
with elvated INR to 9.5 and new acute on chronic renal failure.
He was originally admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for diuresis with IV lasix,
but required transfer to the CCU for milrinone drip after IV
lasix failed to achieve adequate diuresis. He is being
discharged on metolazone and torsemide for diuresis. In
addition, his congestive heart failure medication regimen was
optimally managed to also include the initiation of digoxin and
metoprolol.
.
CCU Course:
Patient was admitted to the CCU for acute on chronic heart
failure and failure to diurese on lasix drip. He was started on
lasix drip, milrinone, and metolazone with excellent response.
He diuresed a net negative 8.5 liters length of stay and his
perepheral edema has resolved and his renal failure improved.
The patient also was treated for a UTI for 5 days with
vancomycin and meropenem from [**2184-3-14**] until [**2184-3-18**]. As a result
he developed thrombocytopenia from 100s to the 50s over the past
4 days probably from the antiobiotics, PLTs were stable at ~100
at the time of discharge. ID was curbsided who recommended
dc'ing the antibiotics as the original U/A was not significantly
dirty and the cultures were thought to be likely contaminant.
The antibiotics were dis
