Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
On [**2164-1-24**], received fludarabine and rituximab.  She went on
to receive 2 cycles of fludarabine and then received Rituxan
alone with four weeks of consolidation.  She developed febrile
neutropenia with this regimen.

From [**2164-10-10**] to [**2164-11-2**], she received weekly Rituxan for
thrombocytopenia that was refractory to steroids and IVIG.

In [**4-/2165**], she started maintenance rituximab.

From [**2166-2-24**] until [**2166-4-3**], she was treated with
chlorambucil for painful adenopathy and IVC compression.  Her
chlorambucil therapy was interrupted due to thrombocytopenia.
Ultimately chlorambucil was stopped on [**2166-10-2**].

Hospitalization from [**2167-1-8**] to [**2167-2-2**] because of airway
compromise from her lymphadenopathy that required intubation and
radiation therapy.

On [**2169-1-18**], she began cyclophosphamide for
progression of her CLL in the form of a rising white blood cell
count as well as Coombs positive hemolytic anemia and probable
autoimmune thrombocytopenia.  Rituximab was held from the 1st
cycle, but she then went on to receive 5 cycles of RCD
(rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone).  She received
Neulasta throughout this course of therapy.

On [**2169-10-31**], she began IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia.  She
had
another treatment with IVIG on [**2169-11-28**].

On [**2169-12-20**], she had further progression of her CLL in the
form
of increased adenopathy within the peritoneum, retroperitoneum,
and pelvis.  She was subsequently started on rituximab and
dexamethasone on [**2169-12-20**], as well as on [**2169-12-21**].

On [**2169-12-26**], she began pentostatin and rituximab with the
pentostatin given at a dose of 2 mg/m2 once every three weeks.
She received 2 cycles of this chemotherapy with Neulasta
support.

On [**2170-2-6**], she presented with increased abdominal pain and
abdominal distention, and because of this pain she required
inpatient admission.
She received cycle 1 of bendamustine on [**2170-2-7**] and
[**2170-2-8**] at a dose of 50 mg/m2 for relapsed CLL with bulky
disease.  The bendamustine was dose reduced by 50% considering
her renal function and tendency for cytopenias.

[**2170-3-7**] - [**2170-3-12**]: hospitalized for neutropenic fever.

[**2170-3-20**] - [**2170-3-28**]: hospitalized for neutropenic fever, right foot
swelling and treated for right leg/foot cellulitis and gout.

[**2170-6-13**]: Cycle 2 Bendamustine 50 mg/m2 (dose reduced)/Rituximab
375 mg/m2

[**2170-7-18**]: Cycle 3 Bendamustine 50 mg/m2/Rituximab 375 mg/m2

[**2170-8-22**]: Cycle 4 dose reduced [**Last Name (un) 106229**] 50 mg/m2/Rituxan 375
mg/m2.
This cycle was complicated by an acute febrile illness -
pneumonia vs. UTI.

[**2170-12-11**]: Patient admitted with fever, likely UTI, and
thrombocytopenia with vaginal bleeding.
.

[**2171-6-15**] - [**2171-6-26**]: Admitted with UTI and pneumonia; had a gout
flare
.
[**8-15**] - [**2171-8-18**] R upper maxillary dental infection, right
maxillary sinusitis treated with Clindamycin and tooth
extractions
.
