History of Present Illness:
84F pmhx cad, chf, copd, recent pna, [**Last Name (un) **], afib on coumadin, htn,
hld, presents from [**Location (un) **] health center with dark hemoccult
positive stool and 3 pt crit drop.
From [**Location (un) **] health care center, admitted from hospital following
an admission for pneumonia and, reported dark hem positive
stool, hct 23.3 baseline hct since admit 26.0, bun 137. full
code PMH: renal injury, htn, afib, lipids on coumadin last INR
was 5.4 on [**9-20**] med was held INR 1.5 today.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 98.5 76 102/40 26 96% 2L Nasal
Cannula. Her initial EKG showed EKG atrial fibrillation at 77,
and a Qwave in 1 and AVL. She has frank melena on guiaic, and
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 745**] records has a HCT drop from 26-->23. A RIJ was
placed, and her CXR was read as her continuing to have a PNA
present. Her NG lavage showed coffee grounds which cleared after
~500cc. GI was consulted, and agreed with a PPI, reversal of her
INR, and transfer to the ICU in case of further deterioration.
.
84 y/o has been at a nursing home or rehab faciilty, was
transferred there with a recent discharge of PNA and COPD, and
HCT was 26 -->23, retching and with melanotic stool, and was 3
points lower, and she was very dehydrated looking on her
chemistry. Is having a decent amount of melena, cleared 500. No
history GI bleed. GI said bolus and gtt, and since cleared
quickly, and relatively close hct to baseline, they wouldn't do
anything acutely. HR in the 80s (beta blocked) low 90s/40s for
BP, similar to sick baseline from prior,a nd still has PNA from
CXR. Started Vitamin K 5 mg, INR 1.7. No blood yet, not FFP. NPO
overnight.
.
She was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, and subsequently
transferred to the CCU during an admissionf rom [**Date range (1) 20927**].
During this admission, she had presented with Acute on chronic
diastolic CHF exacerbation; she required transfer to the CCU for
hypoTN where CVL was placed and she was started on lasix drip
and required dopamine drip [**2-8**] hypotension. She was intubed, and
subseuqnetly was found on a BAL PCP (pneumocystis
jirovecii/carinii). She was ultimately transitioned to Bactrim
DS for a total 21 day course after which she will need PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
Per her son, she has not had any coughing, has not been vomiting
any blood, and has not had any abdominal pain
.

CT Head ([**2108-9-26**])
No acute intracranial process. Note that either MRI with
diffusion-weighted sequence (if feasible) or CT-perfusion study
would be more sensitive for acute ischemia.

Ultrasound of UE ([**2108-10-1**])
No evidence of DVT in the bilateral upper extremities.

Ultrasound of LE ([**2108-10-1**])
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
2. Mixed echogenicity mass in the medial aspect of the right
thigh, most in keeping with a hematoma, necrotic nodal mass or
other complex fluid
collection; clinical correlation is advised.

EGD ([**2108-9-25**])
-Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus. While the lesions were not
initially bleeding there was a moderate amount of bleeding adter
the procedure.
-These lesions are likely intermitently bleeding and was made
acutely worse by NG tube placement. (cytology)
-Medium hiatal hernia
-Bile without any blood was present in the stomach and doedenum,
with the exception of a few flecks of blood in the mid duodenum.
No fresh blood or bleeding source was seen in the duodenum.
-Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum
-Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Esophageal Brushings ([**2108-9-25**])
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Pleural Fluid Cytology ([**2108-10-3**])
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

TTE ([**2108-10-1**])
Very porr image quality.The left atrium is markedly dilated. The
right atrium is markedly dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy (distal LV/apex not well seen). The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An
eccentric jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
84F with PMH significant for CAD, CHF, COPD, recent PNA, afib on
coumadin, htn, hld, presents from [**Location (un) **] health center with GI
Bleed.  She was found to have herpetic esophagitis on IV
acyclovir and L lung whiteout on admission.

She underwent an EGD on [**2108-9-25**] which revealed significant
distal esophagitis, confirmed as HSV.  She was treated with
acyclovir and given blood transfusions as neces
