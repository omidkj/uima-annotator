Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, cough, increasing oxygen requirement, fever,
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77F rehab resident with history of mental retardation, CRI
(baseline Cr 1.2), diabetes, ?CHF who was found to be febrile
(101.9) with wheeze and productive cough the morning of
[**2162-11-21**].  She was given a dose of ciprofloxacin and at 7pm was
found to be lethargic, with oxygen saturations in the 70s and a
swollen tongue.  Her sats improved after 2L NC to 92-93% the
ciprofloxacin was held.  Vitals 97.8, BP 110/70, P 96, RR 22.
She was sent to [**Hospital6 4620**].

At NWH, she was by report awake and AOx3, T 98.6, SBP 95-124,
with an O2Sat 88%RA (96% 2L), diffuse wheezing on exam, and T
wave inversions inferolaterally ([**11-21**] at 2150).  Her CK 876 and
Troponin was 1.6.  She was given nebulizer rxs, ASA, BB, bolused
and started on a heparin gtt.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In ED, T 98.3, P 84-103, SBP 94-150 with an isolated [**Location (un) 1131**] of
69 that improved to 104 with repositioning, RR 15-18, O2Sat 99%
3L.  She was given BTB combivent neb treatments, a dose of
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, bolused with IVF.  Her heparin gtt
was continued @1350 until her PTT came back >150, held for 60
min, restarted at 1200 then held once again for PTT >150.  CXR
concerning for PNA.  She was placed on droplet precautions and a
nasal aspirate for influenza was sent.  Head CT for delta MS.

CXR
IMPRESSION
1. Right hilar prominence. This may be related to mild
congestive failure, although interstitial changes are not seen
at this time, and there is no significant vascular
redistribution noted.
2. Mild patchy opacity at both lung bases is probably related to
atelectasis and body habitus, although infectious etiology
cannot be excluded.

Non contrast Head CT
FINDINGS:
Interpretation is somewhat limited due to patient motion.

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or
shift of normally midline structures. Hypodensity is seen in the
periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel
ischemic changes. There is patchy hypodensity seen in the left
parietal lobe, which may be artifactural in nature due to motion
artifact. Hypodensity with mild encephalomalacic changes are
seen in the left occipital lobe from prior occipital infarction.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation elsewhere in the brain appears
preserved. The osseous structures and soft tissues are
unremarkable. Polypoid mucosal thickening is seen in the left
maxillary sinus. There is also mild mucosal thickening seen in
the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses.

IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial hemorrage. Evaluation is somewhat limited
due to motion. Patchy hypodensity in the left parietal lobe, as
described above, may be artifactual in nature. However, if there
is continued clinical concern for infarction, either MRI with
diffusion-weighted imageing or repeat CT when the patient is
more able to remain still, is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 77F with mild mental retardation, HTN and DM II,
presents with documented fever, increasing oxygen requirement,
wheezy lungs, and CXR c/w PNA as well as NSTEMI.

CV
Non ST elevation MI
The patient presented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 18650**] Hospital and was found
to have an elevated CK in the 800s and a troponin of 0.15 along
with inferolateral T wave inversions on EKG.  She denied chest
pain or pressure, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, but was short
of breath with an increased oxygen requirement.  She was given
an ASA, given a dose of metoprolol IV and bolused and started on
a heparin gtt and titrated to a PTT goal of 60-80.  Her troponin
on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] was 0.15 and CK 748.  She was kept on
telemetry, was continued on her ASA, started on oral beta
blocker which was titrated up as tolerated, and started on
atorvastatin 80mg daily as a lipid profile came back elevated.
She was not started on an ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] given her acute renal
failure.  An ECHO was obtained; her records indicated that she
had a normal EF with trace MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in [**10-7**] at NWH.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that the changes were most
likely due to demand ischemia.  Needs outpt stress.

Hypotension
The patient is normally hypertensive and takes atenolol as an
outpatient.  At both NWH and [**Hospital1 18**] EDs her systolic pressures
ranged between 90-110s, and were responsive to fluid boluses.
She received IV hydration during her admission because she was
likely intravascularly volume depleted and had a preserved EF,
but she was continued on a beta blocker (with parameters) given
concern for acute coronary syndrome as above.  This resolved
without problem.

Renal
Acute on chronic renal failure.
The patient's baseline creatinine is approximately 1.2; on
admission her creatinine was 2.5 and it trended up to 2.7 a few
hours later.  Given the history of decreased oral intake and
fevers, intravascular volume depletion was considered likely,
although acute tubular necrosis given her low blood pressures
was also possible.  The patient's Fe urea nitrogen was
calculated which was 13% suggesting the patient was volume
depleted.  The patient was hydrated with IV fluids in the
emergency department and then upon transfer to the floor. Her
creatinine was followed.

ID
The patient was noted to be febrile on [**11-21**] in the morning at
her rehab with associated cough.  She was given a dose of
ciprofloxacin for possible URI and tylenol and her fever
resolved
