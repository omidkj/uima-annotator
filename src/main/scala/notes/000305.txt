Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Fentanyl / Nickel

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, tenesmus, abdominal bloating.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy with
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, sigmoid resection
with rectal anastamosis, repair of cystotomy and tumor
debulking.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59-year-old G2, P2 who presented with a
several-week history of diarrhea, tenesmus, and abdominal
bloating.  She had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2141-7-4**]
at [**Hospital1 18**], which revealed a small amount of ascites. There was
para-aortic lymphadenopathy measuring up to 12 mm.  The left
adnexum had a 5.6-cm mass.  There was an additional 9-mm
enhancing peritoneal implant in left pericolic gutter.  Other
peritoneal implants could not be excluded.  A CA-125 was noted
to be elevated at 1587.  The patient otherwise feels well.  She
is
tolerating a regular diet.  She denied any urinary complaints.
She has had no vaginal bleeding.  Her weight has been stable.
She had a colonoscopy several years ago which was normal per her
report.  She denied any rectal bleeding.


Past Medical History:
Significant for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right jaw,
status post maxillectomy and radiation therapy in [**2137**].  She has
been disease free since then.  She is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7610**] at [**Hospital6 1708**].  She reports that she
had a chest CT several months ago which revealed a question of
an enlarged lymph nodes and was to have followup for this.
Also, history of NSAID nephropathy, postoperative atrial
fibrillation following maxillectomy, squamous cell carcinoma of
the face status nose surgery.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above.

ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS:  Penicillin and fentanyl.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Evoxac, Tylenol, oral rinse, and vitamins.

OB HISTORY:  Vaginal delivery x2.

[**Hospital6 **] HISTORY:  Last Pap smear was recently normal.  Last
mammogram
was recently abnormal but followup was recommended.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient neither smokes nor drinks.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a maternal aunt who had breast
cancer in her 70s, another maternal aunt with esophageal cancer,
and paternal relatives with lung cancer.


Physical Exam:
GENERAL:  Well developed and thin.
HEENT:  Sclerae were anicteric.  There were postoperative and
post-radiation changes on the right side of the face.
LYMPHATICS:  Lymph node survey was negative.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular without murmurs.
BREASTS:  Without masses.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and moderately distended and without palpable
masses.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
PELVIC:  The vulva and vagina were normal.  The cervix was
normal to palpation.  Bimanual and rectovaginal examination
revealed a large firm mass in the cul-de-sac which was somewhat
immobile. There was a question of cul-de-sac nodularity.  The
rectal was intrinsically normal.

[**2141-7-25**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is focal hypokinesis
of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. mild pulmonary artery

study (images reviewed) of [**2141-7-21**], overall rtight
ventricular contractile function appears somewhat improved.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7611**] was admitted after undergoing an exploratory
laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, sigmoid resection with
rectal anastomosis, repair of cystotomy and tumor debulking for
a pelvic mass previously visualized on CT. Prior to her surgery,
an epidural was placed by anesthesia for post-operative pain
management. Her post-operative course was complicated by
hypotension, right ventricular hypokinesis, NSTEMI, a-fib,
anemia and oxygen desaturation.  She was admitted to the ICU on
post-op day four for management of post-operative a-fib.

# Hypotension: On post op day one and two, the patient was
hypotensive to the 80s/40s.  There was no evidence of acute
blood loss as her HCT remained stable post-operatively.  Her
urine output was adequate.  An epidural was in place for pain
control.  Her SBP was maintained > 90 with aggressive fluid
management.  The ddx for her hypotension included epidural
induced sympathectomy versus myocardial ischemia.  Her EKG was
unchanged.  When the hypotension did not resolve after capping
the epidural an Echocardiogram performed which showed focal
right ventricular hypokinesis.  She had a positive troponin
which peaked at 0.2 on post-op day two.

# Elevated cardiac enzymes:  No known h/o CAD prior to this
hospitalization.  Troponin bumped to max of 0.20, then trended
down slightly to 0.06.  MBI negative x3.  CEs sent initially in
the setting of hypotension and finding on TTE of RV free wall
hypokinesis.  Reportedly this was prior to a. fib w/ RVR so
troponin leak appears to predate the rapid a. fib.  Picture is
suggestive of perioperative NSTEMI per cardiology.
Differential, however, includes ischemia vs. less likely
myocarditis as cause of elevated troponin.  EKG when in NSR in
the setting of hypotension did not reveal evidence of ischemia,
but w/ atrial fibrillation now has new TWI in I, aVL which may
represent demand ischemia in LCx distribution. A statin, BB, and
ASA were started for risk factor modification per cardiology.

# Right ventricular hypokinesis:  Severe free wall motion
