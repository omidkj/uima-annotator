CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old
[**Doctor First Name **] speaking gentleman with a history of severe interstitial
lung disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease and chronic renal failure who experienced worsening
shortness of breath over the day prior to admission.  The
patient at home had oxygen saturations in the 70s on 3.5
liters by nasal cannula and right-sided chest pain.  The
patient had been drinking Ensure the few days prior to
admission.  In the Emergency Room the patient was diagnosed
with presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation and
worsening of his interstitial lung disease.  He received
Lasix and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further treatment.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was well-appearing elderly
man in mild respiratory distress.  Sclera were clear.  Neck,
notable for jugulovenous distension and tenderness in his
right calf.  His chest showed audible crackles bilaterally
but cleared anteriorly.  His cardiac examination was normal
S1 and S2, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.  His
abdomen was benign with mild hepatomegaly.  His extremities
showed trace bilateral pedal edema and neurologically he was
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an elevated white count of
19.1, hematocrit of 38.4, platelets 264.  Chem-7 134, 5.5,
95, 24, 58, 119, 274.  The patient's INR was noted to be 7.4.
Creatinine kinase was 71, troponin was 3.7.  His
electrocardiogram was ventricularly paced in 70's, no
ischemic changes.  His chest x-ray showed diffuse alveolar
interstitial changes, likely superimposed congestive heart
failure or interstitial lung disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary - The patient suffers from
respiratory distress, likely secondary to both congestive
heart failure and worsening of his interstitial lung disease.
This has been an acute and chronic progression of this
disease which is likely a terminal process.  Despite
aggressive treatment with Prednisone and antibiotics, the
patient was aggressively diuresed for congestive heart
failure component, continued on his Prednisone and treated
with Nitroglycerin drip, Captopril, Digoxin, Azithromycin,
Ceftriaxone and Morphine.  He continued to have significant
oxygen requirement and intermittently complained of shortness
of breath.  After extensive conversations with the family it
was agreed that the patient would be taken home for home
hospice care given the likely terminal prognosis and
progression of his interstitial lung disease and congestive
heart failure, and the fact that there was little medical
treatment that we could provide at this point to cure this
condition.

2.  Cardiac - The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease and congestive heart failure.  He was treated with
Nitroglycerin, Lasix and Morphine.  The Nitroglycerin drip
was weaned off and the patient was started on Nitroglycerin
patch.  When the Nitroglycerin drip was turned initially the
patient experienced some right-sided neck pain and chest
tenderness that possibly could have been ischemic in origin.
The patient requires aggressive treatment with Morphine,
Nitroglycerin and ACE inhibitor to minimize his discomfort
related to the ischemic pain.  In addition, the patient has a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was
supertherapeutic in his INR.  The Warfarin was discontinued
on his admission and was not restarted given the hospice
disposition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Poor.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home hospice.

10. Roxanol 20 mg per ml solution, 5-20 mg p.o. q. 2 hours as
needed for shortness of breath, cough or pain
