History of Present Illness:
42 year old male with history of asthma, hypertension,
macrocytic anemia, DVT/PE in [**2108**] and erosive gastritis who was
admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] with alcoholic pancreatitis and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for acute respiratory failure and shock.

Briefly, the patient increased alcohol consumption recently to
[**12-4**]+ pints daily in the setting of becoming unemployed ([**Month (only) 956**]
[**2112**]). Reportedly he had consumed no alcohol for ~ four days
prior to admission to OSH [**2113-12-13**] for abdominal pain. The
abdominal pain occurred ~9:30am on [**2113-12-13**] after he had a
light breakfast (half a bagel). He described the pain as
epigastric and tight band-like, with associated nausea, no
vomiting. +chills, no fevers or sweats.

He received 8 liters of volume resuscitation on the medicine
floor but became hypotensive to SBP60s on [**2113-12-14**] and was
transferred to the ICU where he was resuscitatied with 10-12
more liters but required norepinephrine to maintain his blood
pressures. His creatinine rose to 2.9 (from 1.0), his calcium
dropped to 4s, his magnesium also dropped to 1.2. CT
abdomen/pelvis (without contrast) showed severe pancreatitis but
no evidence of other complications. Because of his history of
prior DVT/PE and his hemodynamic instability, LENIs were
performed showing a DVT in his right popliteal fossa and the
patient was started on heparin gtt (at 1500 units). As his
abdomen became more distended, the patient developed respiratory
distress and was intubated ~ midnight [**2113-12-15**], sedated with
fentanyl (150mcg) and propofol (70mcg) and his norepi was
increased (0.9mcg). He was started on bicarb gtt for metabolic
acidosis and renal failure. Overnight [**2113-12-15**] from midnight to
7am, the patient was oliguric (130cc) and CXR showed low lung
volumes, atelectasis. His labs were notable for Na 121, K 5.9,
Cr 5.0, calcium 3.2, magnesium 1.8, CK 8565 and albumin 1.6. He
was treated for his hyperkalemia with IV bicarb gtt (100cc/hr),
10 grams IV calcium gluconate, insulin gtt (12 units, for blood
sugars 300s). Left IJ and arterial line placed prior to
transfer. The patient was started on Vasopressin en route (0.4)
and Vent settings were AC18, PS 22, PEEP 10, FiO2 60%.

On arrival to the ICU, inital vitals were, T: 97.2 BP: 68/39 P:
113 R: 12 O2: 100% on AC (PMV). The patient's norepi and
vasopressin were increased and phenylephrine was started, in
addition to fluid boluses. Bladder pressure was 25.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 yo M w/ PMH of asthma, HTN, macrocytic anemia, PE/DVT,
erosive gastritis, alcoholism, and prior bouts of
alcohol-induced pancreatitis requiring ICU stay in [**2108**],
transferred from OSH for shock, likely secondary to severe
pancreatitis.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Shock: Distributive and hypovolemic shock in the setting of
severe pancreatitis, resulting in respiratory failure, renal
failure, and pressor-dependence. Had questioned possible
cardiogenic component, given possibility of PE with known DVT,
however echo did not show signs of right heart strain and EF
normal.  On admission, started on triple pressors with
norepinephrine, vasopressin, and neosynephrine, but he was
quickly weaned off the neosynephrine.  He was aggressively
volume resuscitated, getting almost 20L of fluid within the
first day of arrival. Lactates normalized.  Able to
intermittently wean down pressors as he appeared to stabilize
after 3-4 days. His pressures improved with fluid removal w/
CVVH. Pt remained on low-dose norepi w/ CVVH until decision was
made to move towards comfort measures due after discussion with
family.

# Acute respiratory failure: Due to combination of shock with
aggressive volume resuscitation, ARDS, and extra-thoracic
pressure from abdominal distension.  PE thought to be unlikely
given normal echo, but could not obtain CTA given renal failure.
 Questioned possible pneumonia on admission-- sputum at OSH grew
moraxella and haemophilus at OSH and had positive gram stains
here at [**Hospital1 **], however never cultured any organisms from sputum
since his arrival at [**Hospital1 **].  Pt completed empiric 8 day treatment
for HAP/HCAP with Vancomycin/Zosyn/levofloxacin (finished [**12-20**]).  Started on ARDSnet protocol, paralyzed initially for more
effective ventilation.  Put on APRV for further recruitment and
