Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Debridement of stage 4 sacral ulcer
Muscle biopsy of right arm
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
83 yo male with PMH CAD, HOCM, dysphagia, and recent hypercarbic
respiratory failure (s/p trach/PEG) initially admitted to MICU
from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for "altered mental status".
.
The pt originally underwent an elective EGD to evaluate
persistent dysphagia (negative for stricture or malignancy).  He
became hypoxic with oxygen sat in the 80's following procedure.
Pt was subsequently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
failure of unclear etiology, unable to wean from vent and trach/
PEG placed.  He also had evidence of respiratory muscle weakness
with NIFs around -6.
.
Pt has undergone extensive w/u for neuromuscular dysfunction
which included:
-Negative head CT, c-cpine CT
-EEG: diffuse slowing in delta range and intermediate frontal
sharp complexes
-EMG 1: Moderately severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy
with concomitant median neuropathy at left wrist.
-EMG 2: suggestive of mild to moderate myopathy process
affecting proximal muscles in the upper/lower extremities. not
suggestive of generalized disorder of motor neurons (as seen in
ALS).
.
Labwork included:
-RPR negative. CSF: wbc 0, rbc 1600 negative for crypto, VDRL,
HSV
Enterovirus negative.
-Acetylcholine receptor Ab nl
-SPEP: polyclonal c/w inflammation
-Neuron specific enolase 21.2 (nl 0-30) (released in
neuroblastoma and small cell lung cancer)
-fat pad bx - negative for amyloid
-TSH: 2.2; ACE 11; iron studies nl
-Heavy metal screen negative
.
While in the MICU, patient was weaned off to trach mask and had
a stable respiratory course. He was found to have chronic
osteomyelitis of his sacrum secondary to stage 4 sacral ulcer
which probed to bone, confirmed by bone scan [**9-18**].  He was
started on zosyn and vanco for broad antibiotic coverage.
Platics took patient to the OR for debridement on [**9-14**].
.
From a neurologic standpoint, he was intially able to squeeze
right hand, close eyes, and open mouth. His mental status was
thought possibly due to overall picture of rapid neurologic
decline. He was continued on a fentanyl patch but his neurontin,
morphine, and ativan were held. Without improvement, morphine
was once again added for comfort. Neurology consulted, and
repetitive stimulation negative for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] or [**Location (un) **]
[**Location (un) **] syndrome. A trial of dantrolene was given for possible NMS
but no response, EMG showed polyneuropathy and polymyopathy.
Sinemet started for possiblity of Parkinson's.  The pt was then
transferred to a general medicine floor and ID was consulted for
fevers- rec fungal work-up and anti-fungal therapy started.  Pt
also found to have B/L UE DVTs, started on Lovenox for
anti-coagulation.  Pt also had runst of NSVTs, evaluated by
cardiology.
.
Surgery was consulted for diagnostic muscle biopsy given
persistent rigidity.  He was taken to the OR for bx of L biceps
brachi.  He had an episode of hemoptysis during the procedure,
about 300 cc of blood.  Thoracics was consulted, underwent
intra-operative bronch and washings.  They did not localize a
source of bleed.  The patient was then transferred to MICU for
further eval and observation.
.
Currently, patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli, does not
follow commands. He does respond to movement of his extremities
with grimaces and fights against manual opening of his eyes.

CXR [**2159-9-14**]: Cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely
enlarged. Relatively mild perihilar opacification in both lungs
is consistent with edema but there are two regions of more dense
focal consolidation, the suprahilar right lung and the lateral
left lung base, suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. Small
bilateral pleural effusion is present and there may well be
pericardial fluid. Transvenous pacer leads follow their expected
courses to the right atrium and floor of the right ventricle. A
second ventricular lead has a large loop in the region of the
tricuspid valve, but its tip projects along the anticipated
location of the floor of the right ventricle. There is no
pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube is slightly canted. Clinical
evaluation is recommended to confirm appropriate placement.
.
HEAD CT [**2159-9-16**]:
1. Atrophy.
2. Prominence of the ventricles probably not out of proportion
to the degree of overall atrophy, but the possibility of
communicating hydrocephalus cannot be entirely excluded.
3. Areas of white matter hypodensity, most suggestive of chronic
small vessel ischemic disease.
4. Vascular calcifications.
5. Fluid throughout the right mastoid air cells, which could be
seen in mastoiditis.
.
EMG [**2159-9-16**]:
Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for a
generalized
myopathic process with minimal denervating features. In
addition, the findings are suggestive of a mild-to-moderate,
generalized sensorimotor polyneuropathy with predominantly
axonal features. There is no evidence for a pre- or post-
synaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission based on the
repetitive stimulation studies performed. The reduced activation
on needle electromyography also suggests a central component to
the patient's weakness; however, this cannot be adequately
assessed given the patient's reduced level of consciousness
throughout the study.
.
US DOPPLER [**2159-9-20**]:
Bilateral upper extremity DVTs as described.
.
ECHO [**2159-9-21**]:
These findings are consistent with hypertrophic non-obstructive
cardiomyopathy (HCM). Cardiac amyloidosis should also be
considered.
.
MUSCLE BX [**2159-9-24**]:
PRELIMINARY RESULTS:
PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS:
LEFT BICEPS MUSCLE BIOPSY (formalin-fixed tissue only):
Scattered nuclear knots and scattered small, angulated
myofibers, suggestive of denervation atrophy.
Moderate variation in myofiber size.
Increased internalized nuclei.
No significant myofiber degeneration, regeneration, or
myophagocytosis.
No demonstrable endomysial infiltrating process.
No significant lymphocytic inflammation.
.
CHEST CT [**2069-9-25**]:
1. Airspace consolidation in
