Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo M w/ ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 10-15%, 3+ MR, CAD who
presents with CHF and RLL PNA.
.
# CHF- He responded well to IV lasix at 40 [**Hospital1 **]. He was
ultimately changed to lasix 80 PO BID. We also continued beta
blocker and spironolactone. He should restrict his fluid and
check his weight daily at home

# CAD- Known CAD s/p CABG w/ patent LIMA to LAD and SVG to PDA
from previous cath.  No chest pain.  He ruled out at outside
hospital.  No ECG changes. We continued ASA, plavix, statin
.
# Rhythm/PAF-  He had episodes of VT on interrogation. He had an
attempted VT ablation complicated by cardiac arrest, requiring
intubatetion and brief CCU stay. He recvered well from that and
was extubated 30 hours later. We ultimately decided on just
continuing amiodarone at higher dose. He has an ICD.
.
# Vavular Disease(MR/TR)- 3+ MR.  Treated as heart failure as
above.
