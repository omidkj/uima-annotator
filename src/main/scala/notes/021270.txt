Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Low energy, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
expired


History of Present Illness:
79yoM with prior MI s/p PTCA, VT/VF s/p ablation, sCHF (last EF
23% in [**2110**]) presenting with low energy, fatigue, abdominal
discomfort.

The patient reported progressively worsening fatigue and
lethargy for the past 4 months associated with nausea.  He also
reports a progressive dry cough during that time period, but
denies sputum production, fevers, shortness of breath, or sick
contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] does report sinus pressure but denies headaches,
rhinorrhea, or sore throat.  Per ED report, he had endorsed
abdominal discomfort with belching but the patient currently
denies this history.  He also endorses increased significant
water intake recently with increased pedal edema.  His
cardiologist reports increased facial edema as well.

Of note, the patient has had difficulty with his gait for the
past 6 months, which is documented in OMR.  His primary care
physician was concerned for Parkinsonian symptoms given his
facial expression, gait imbalance, and midl tremor.  The patient
had declined neurological evaluation per OMR notes.

On review of systems, the patient denies headache, vision
changes, confusion or somnolence, sore throat, sputum
production, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, chest pain, emesis,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, new or unusual
myalgias or arthralgias, or rash.  He does report he was
constipated last week and took an enema with improvement of his
symptoms.  His last BM was reportedly yesterday, and he denies
BRBPR or melena.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97 127 151/117 20 95% 3L.
Sodium was discovered to be 115, and the patient was given NS
700cc total.  Head CT showed no evident cerebral edema.  CXR
showed L lobe infiltrate with a round area in the center of
lucency concerning for possible cavitation, with radiology
recommendation of further evaluation w/ CT scan given concern
for abscess.  He received Levofloxacin 750mg, Ceftriaxone 1gm,
Azithromycin 500mg (for Legionella coverage).  He was noted to
be in new onset a fib with RVR, and was given in the diltiazem
10 mg IV x2 and 30 mg p.o. for rate control with good effect.
He was admitted to the MICU for the degree of hyponatremia.
Subsequent VS prior to transfer was: 134/116 and subsequently
109/76, 89, 24, 94% 3L
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient denied symptoms other than
fatigue, including chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion,
abdominal pain, nausea.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or
urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin
changes.

Past Medical History:

site of scar from previous MI.
- Inferior MI in [**2087**] s/p PTCA; MIBI in [**2110**] with severe fixed
inferior defect
- CHF: EF=26% in [**2110**]
- HTN
- Anxiety
- Hyperlipidemia
- Concern for possible Parkinson's disease per PCP note, given
gait, tremor and facial expression
- Vertigo
- Hiatal hernia
- Basal cell carcinoma s/p excision from left knee
- Back pain

Social History:
- Tobacco:  Smoked 3ppd x 20 yrs but quit in [**2087**]
- Alcohol:  2 beers before dinner daily

IMAGING:

TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity
enlargement with severe and extensive systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Severe mitral
regurgitation. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Dilated
thoracic aorta.

CT Head: No acute intracranial abnormality. If concern persists
for subtle parenchymal edema, MRI is the more sensitive modality
for evaluation.

CT chest:
1. Large consolidations involving the left upper lobe without
cavitation/lung abscess.
2. Moderate bilateral simple pleural effusions with atelectasis
of the
adjacent lung.
3. Moderate to sever cardiomegaly with calcification of
papillary muscle,
posterior and posteroinferior wall of left ventricle reflecting
sequaela of post myocardial infarction. Morphology reflecting
akinetic left ventricular wall is better correlated with MIBG
scan dated [**2110-3-8**].
4. Enlarged and borderline sized mediastinal lymph nodes.
5. Moderate-to-severe coronary artery atherosclerotic
calcification.
.
[**2118-9-29**]
ECHO
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to
akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and hypokinesis of
the rest of he left ventricle. The inferior and posterior walls
are thin, fibrotic, and akietic. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2118-9-23**], severe left and right ventricular
contractile dysfunction and severe mitral regurgitation are
again seen.
