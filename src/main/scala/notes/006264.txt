Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent HTLV1 associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old female with past medical history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia who
was newly diagnosed with the lymphomatous form of HTLV
associated T-Cell lymphoma/leukemia in [**2147-5-30**].  She
received fluids and bisphosphonate for hypercalcemia and CHOP*1
before being discharged on Zidovudine and Interferon alpha
therapy.  Interferon had to be discontinued due to cytopenias
and AZT was continued through [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.  She recieved
an additional six cycles of CHOP coupled with Denileukin
diftitox and was in complete remission at the cessation of cycle
five (her fourth as an outpatient).  Next, she received two
additional cycles of CHOP + Denileukin diftitox consolidation
before proceeding to maintenance therapy with Denileukin
diftitox two doses Q14 days.

Unfortunately, in [**2147-1-28**] the patient began to experience a
hematologic relapse with a rise in her WBC to 9.4 and atypical
lymphs on a CBC from [**2148-2-9**].  Her LDH had peaked in the
1300-1600 range and then she went on to receive CHOP w/
Denileukin diftitox on [**2148-2-26**].  This led to a response with her
LDH dropping to 199 and cytopenias ensuing.  She was admitted to
NEBH from [**Date range (3) 79098**] with neutropenic fever and phayrngitis
for which she was treated with levofloxacin.  Since that
admission, she reported dealing with recurrent lymphadenopathy
with palpable cervical, preauricular, occipital, and axillary
nodes.  She had also developed fevers and night sweats over the
past four days prior to admission.  The highest fever she has
had was 101.4 after a Denileukin diftitox dose two days prior to
presentation. She had a repeat chest CT on [**2148-4-9**] that showed
increased lymphadenopahthy.

She was admitted again on [**4-18**] for [**Hospital1 **]. She had developed
adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy (EF 25-30%) and had to stop
[**Hospital1 **] 3 days into therapy.  Since then her volume status has
been difficult to manage on the floor, and she was alternatively
being given IVFs and diuresed with Lasix.  She had a brief stay
in the Medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]) from respiratory distress, which was
felt to be pulm edema and was treated with aggressive diuresis.
She was then tried on ARA-G (last course was on [**5-15**]) but was
running into problems with tumor lysis syndrome and the fluids
necessary to treat/prevent this.  She was also started on
vanc/levofloxacin for suspected line infection and pneumonia on
[**5-20**].

OTHER RESULTS
===============
Chest Radiograph [**2148-4-18**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. No evidence of
pneumonia.

CT Chest W/Contrast [**2148-4-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of the bilateral axillary lymph nodes.
2. Moderate increase in size of the pre-existing mediastinal
lymph nodes.
3. Unremarkable lung parenchyma.
4. No evidence of abdominal lymph nodes.
5. No evidence of osteolytic lesions.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/Contrast [**2148-4-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase left lateral breast lymphadenopathy,
abutting the
pectoralis. Differential includes lymphoma versus breast origin.

2. Interval increase of retroperitoneal lymphadneopathy.
3. Unchanged thickened distal antrum and pylorus. Recommend
correlations in the clinical context of lymphoma.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2148-4-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(EF 45%), c/w CAD. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-3**],
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more evident
because of a technically-better study. The findings are similar.
