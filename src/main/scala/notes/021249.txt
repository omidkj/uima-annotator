fracture is seen.

Shoulder:
Impacted left humeral head fracture.

C-spine:
Incomplete views of the cervical spine on the lateral
projection.
No significant malalignment is seen, however, CT examination is
recommended
for further evaluation.

pelvic fracture. A CT examination can be considered for further
evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year-old F with history of COPD, non small cell Lung CA of
lingula s/p resection, hyperparathyroidism who presents s/p
mechanical fall found to have left proximal humeral fx and left
superior pubic rami fracture.
.
# Left proximal humeral fx: Orthopedic team evaluated patient.
Patient declined surgery as she has several comorbitities
putting her at risk.  Pain was controlled with narcotics. Arm
supported with sling. She has a sling for comfort and is not
allowed to do heavy lifting.  She might re-consider ORIF vs
hemiarthoplasty in future if patient reconsiders surgery.  She
was to follow-up with orthopedic surgery in late [**Month (only) 404**]. She
does not require dvt prophylaxis with lovenox for her upper
extremity fracture per ortho.  She was seen by PT/OT while in
the hospital.  She received MS Contin 15mg [**Hospital1 **] while in the
hospital and this should be tapered off as her pain improves.
.
# Left pubic ramus fracture: Medicaly managed. No ROM
restrictions
.
#Pneumonia: She developed a fever up to 101.5, despite 1 g of
Tylenol. UA was clean, but CXR showed a RLL pneumonia. She was
started on Levoflox/Flagyl on [**2175-12-3**], but continued to
deteriorate requiring more oxygen. She was switched to
Vanc/Zosyn/Levoflox and required ICU transfer for monitoring
where she was stable on 35-50% shovel mask. She was continued on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin and completed an 8 day course on
[**2175-12-11**]. She was also started on a 7-day prednisone taper
60-40-40-20-20-20-20 mg out of concern for wheezing and
concomitant COPD exacerbation which completed on [**2175-12-11**]. CXR on
HD#7 showed worsening R pleural effusion. Ultrasound showed
small effusion with some organization. On [**12-6**], she was satting
95% on RA she was transferred to the floor. At the time of
transfer to rehab her 02 sat was 93% on 1-2L/min nasal cannula.
Continue to wean oxygen as tolerated to maintain SpO2 > 93%.
Recommend continuing scheduled nebulizer or MDI treatments while
patient requires supplemental oxygen.
.
# Osteopenia: Patient has several risk factors for fractures
including hyperparathyroidism, repeated prednisone use for COPD
exacerbations, vit D deficiency.  She was on calcium and vitamin
D at home.  She was continued on vitamin D and calcium. She has
been approved by her insurance for reclast but has not yet
received a dose.  Please recommend that patient address starting
Reclast with her primary care provider after discharge.
.
# COPD: She was also started on a 7-day prednisone taper
60-40-40-20-20-20-20 out of concern for wheezing and concomitant
COPD exacerbation which completed on [**2175-12-11**]. She had no cough,
no fevers, or wheezing on discharged. Her O2 requirement
gradually decreased during her hospitalization. She is being
discharged on her home inhalers.
.
# She was on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis and sent to rehab on
hep sc which can be stopped once she is ambulating regularly.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Her creatinine climbed up to 1.2 and
later her ARF resolved and her creatinine was 1.2. This ARF may
be secondary to dye as well as pre-renal azotemia as the patient
was clinically dry at the time of her renal failure.
.
# Constipation: She had no BM for 8 days. She then moved her
bowels on [**2175-12-10**].  She is being dicharged on colace, senna, and
miralax.
.
# Pulmonary Nodule: Per Pulm notes has been stable for 3 years.
