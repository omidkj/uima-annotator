Right and left heart catheterization, coronary
angioplasty/stent,placement of intraaortic balloon pump [**2112-1-8**]

Emergent coronary artery artey bypass graft
x2(SVG-LAD,SVG-DG),closure of ventricular septal defect,
resection of right ventricular aneurysm [**2112-1-10**]

History of Present Illness:
This 71 year old white male presents with a one week history of
chest burning and reflux like symptoms. He states that
approximately one week ago he noticed that he had more symptoms
of acid reflux. He also stated that he had a burning chest
discomfort while at rest and occasionally with exertion.

On the night of [**1-7**], the patient stated that his heartburn
became unbearable and he decided to seek treatment at [**Hospital1 18**]
Neeham. Records are not available from his presentation, but he
reportedly was found to have ST elevation inferiorly. He was
given ASA 325mg, a Heparin bolus and drip, high dose statin, IV
Lopressor, and Plavix 600mg and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization. Hisvital signs were reportedly stable, with BP
in low 100s systolic.

On transfer, he was found to have a systolic BP in 70s and was
started on Dopamine. At catheterization he was found to have an
occluded proximal RCA and recieved three drug eluting stents.
70% LAD and 60% Diag lesions were not intervened upon. He was
found to have elevated right sided pressures with an elevated
wedge pressure.

On transfer to the CCU, he complained of persistent [**2-17**] mid
sternal chest pain. EKG showed inferior Q waves and pain was
resolved with morphine.

Physical Exam:
Admission:

GENERAL: NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

line. RR. Unable to assess for m/r/g as IABP in plae.
LUNGS: CTA anterolaterally
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: Multiple tatoos on arms and chest
PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+ DP/PT dopplerable
Left: Carotid 2+ DP/PT dopplerable


Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization [**2112-1-8**]:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
3. Successful suction thrombectomy, PTCA, and stenting of the
proximal
RCA.

Echo [**2112-1-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal for the patient's body size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior,
inferolateral and basal inferoseptal akinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission on the 28th Dopamaine was begun and he went
to the cath lab where stenting to the RCA was performed with
three stents and an intraaortic balloon pump was placed for
hypotension.  His hemodynamics stablized somewhat, however, he
remained Dopamine dependent.  He continued to have stuttering
angina treated with Morphine. The balloon pump was removed on
the 30th.

An echo on the 31st demonstrated a VSD.  He remained in
cardiogenic-shock.  He was hemodynamically unstable on pressors.
 He was acidotic with a pH 7.18 and lactate over 11.  He went
emergently to the cath lab again where another balloon pump was
placed, then taken to the Operating Room.  The ventricular
septal defect was repaired, the right ventricular aneurysm was
resected and two vein grafts were performed.  He weaned from
bypass on high dose pressors.  The chest was left open. See
operative note for details.

He remained in cardiogenic shock after surgery on high dose
Epinephrine, Levophed, Neo-Synephrine and Vasopressin as well as
the intraaortic balloon pump. He was paralyzed and sedated due
to the open chest.

Lactates rose, fell and rose again. His extremeties were cold
and mottled, he was profoundly acidotic, despite bicarbonate
boluses, THAM infusions.  His LFTs continued to rise and he was
auto-anticoagulated with an INR of 4.6 and PTT in the 70s. The
lactate rose to 15.2 with persistent LFT increases by 0200 on
[**1-12**].

Transplant surgery was consulted for the persisitent acidosis
with elevated LFTs and felt that there was no role for
laparoscopy given his shock and the unlikelihood of finding a
discreet reparable source.  Vascular surgery saw him for the
cold extremeties.

Despite high dose pressors and other manipulations he remained
hypotensive and in cardiogenic-shock. His son visited the
bedside and he was aware of the grave nature of the patient's
condition.  After discussion with the family, it was decided to
not initiate CPR.  The patient did expire surrounded by family.
