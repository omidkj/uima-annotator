Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  s/p Intubation
2.  s/p Tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
73 y.o. man who presents for respiratory distress.  History is
limited and is from son and [**Name (NI) **] notes.  He was apparently feeling
ok yesterday.  This morning, per his living facility, he was
less responsive and in respiratory distress.  O2 sat was in the
50s.  He may have had a mild cough over the last few days.  He
was brought to the ED. He was intubated on arrival for
unresponsiveness, cyanosis.  Subsequently, he was hypotensive
with SBP to 60s.  A CVL was placed, he was given 2.25 L NS and
started on levophed with response in SBP up to 110s.  He was
started on vanco, levo, flagyl for pneumonia after infiltrate
was seen on CXR.  Then transported to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Pt had CXR on [**2-4**] which showed bibasilar infiltrates.  He was
started on levaquin and flagyl.

CXR:  RLL patchy opacity
ECG:  porr baseline but appears SR at 96bpm, nml axis, ints.
PRWP.  TWI in V2, no acute ST-T changes (c/w [**7-12**])
.
[**2123-2-11**]- abdominal x-ray -  No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Nasogastric tube in satisfactory position.
.
Echo [**2123-2-15**] - Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size  are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably mildly  depressed. The
basal septum appears hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion appear normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are  mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation  is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral  regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is
no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2122-8-5**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension
detected has increased. A  mildly depressed LVEF is now
suggested, but not conclusive (poor image  quality). If
clinically indicated, a repeat TTE with echo contrast (Definity)
 may better define regional/global LV systolic function.
.
CT abdomen - [**2123-2-22**] - IMPRESSION:
1. No findings to explain patient's bacteremia within the chest,
abdomen, or pelvis. No abscesses.
2. Extensive bullous emphysema within the lungs. Bilateral
pleural effusions, findings to suggest loculation. Bibasilar
consolidation has the appearance of more of atelectasis. Nodules
within the lungs should be followed up by CT in [**4-12**] months after
the patient's current condition has resolved.
3. The pancreatic head cystic lesion and small pancreatic neck
cystic lesion are unchanged in appearance from [**2122-5-14**]. These
likely represent cysts, however IPMT cannot be excluded, and
attention should be paid to this on follow-up.
4. Decreased size of right common iliac artery aneurysm after
graft placement. No evidence of superinfection of this aneurysm.
No change in the aortic, left common iliac, or bilateral common
femoral aneurysms. No evidence of infection of these aneurysms.
5. Gastrostomy tube tip is within the second/third portion of
the duodenum.
6. Persistent atrophic left kidney.
.
CXR [**2123-3-4**]- No change in comparison to the prior study. No
evidence for new infiltrate

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o. man with h/o severe COPD, pneumonias, HTN who presents
with hypoxic respiratory failure, unresponsiveness, and
hypotension.  Given fevers, infiltrate on CXR, most likely
etiology of respiratory failure is pneumonia, and this is also
the most likely cause of his hypotension/septic shock.  There is
no evidence of ACS or CHF.
..
..
## Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Intuabated on AC mode on
admission.  Given his history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias
with MRSA and Pseudomonas he was started on broad comverate
antibiotics with vanc, zosyn and azithromycin.  Urine legionella
was negative.  DFA for influenza also negative.  Sputum cultures
returned with MSSA and pesudeomonas ([**Last Name (un) 36**] to zosyn).  He was
treated with Vanc, Zosyn and azithro for 14 day course.  He was
also given albuterol/atrovent nebs given history of COPD.  He
did not have much improvement in lung mechanics with 20 puffs of
bronchodilator trial and was given burst of IV steroids
(methylpred 80 IV for 7 days).  Daily RSBIs were checked with
not much improvement in his respiratory status.  With attempts
of weaning pt became tachycardic and tachypneic and pressure
support was unable to be weaned off.  He was evaluated by
Interventional pulmonary who planned on placing a trach, this
was delayed given positive blood culture with klebsiella, see
below.  After cultures were negative for 6 days, IP placed a
bedside trach.  He will need to have continued mechanical
ventilation for now which should be weaned at a vent facility as
tolerated.  The trach should also help pt with preventing
aspiration as he's had multiple admissions for aspiration
pneumonias.
.
## Septic shock:  Likely due to pneumonia.  Treated with abx as
above.  Given IVF and levophed initially, with goals of CVP
10-12 corrected for PEEP, MAP>60, and UOP>30 cc/hr.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim
showed appropriate response. Levophed was weaned off and he did
not require pressors thereafter.
.
## CAD/CHF:  No indication of acute process.  Held
antihypertensives on admission. His blood pressure remained
stable and he was not restarted on his anithypertensives.  Given
his CAD, inquired with PCP and started him asa, statin.
..
## Bacteremia: Few days after admission pt had temp spike and
had blood cultures done which later grew Klebsiella.  There was
no clear source of infection.  So CT scan of abdomen was done
without clear source.  His central line was changed and cultures
were negative thereafter.  he should be treated for total 2 week
course with levofloxacin (start date [**2123-2-24**]).

## [**Doctor First Name 48**]/CRI:  Likely pre-renal from sepsis and hypotension.  This
resolved with initial ivf.  Creatinine remained around 1.4-1.7
