Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from Neurosurg to MICU for Acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC Filter Placement
Central Line placement
Arterial Line placement
Hemodialysis
Intubation/Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
85M with prior DVT, HTN and CKD was admitted to NEBH with
decreased appetite and LE swelling. Found to have extensive DVT
and acute on chronic RF. Was started on heparin gtt and
yesterday was noted to have a right facial droop and increased
dysarthria, R-sided weakness and somnolence. He developed what
appeared to be a R-sided seizure and then a grand-mal seizure in
the CT scanner at the OSH. He was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the neurosurgery service.
He was noted to be hypotensive after intubation (without
sedation) prior to transfer and was started on neo. An aline was
placed also prior to transfer.
.
This morning, the neurosurgery attending asked that the MICU
take over his care given the complexity of his medical problems.

.
On eval, he was intubated and sedated. Does not follow commands.
Not on sedation although received 2 mg of IV ativan within the
past 2 hours for possible seizure.
.
Per his son who is at his bedside, he was doing well until about
2 months ago at which point they noticed a 15 pound weight loss
and hematuria. Bladder cancer was discovered and he had a
cystoscopic removal of tumor. 2 weeks ago, his son noted that he
was increasingly tired w/ decreased appetite and LE swelling. He
fell and hit his head about 1 week ago but his son noticed only
a small cut and so did not have him evaluated. Over the week
prior to admission, he became unable to walk and needed a
wheelchair to get around.

Radiology Studies:
.
CT head on admission:
FINDINGS: A mixed but predominantly hyperdense collection
overlies the entire left cerebral hemisphere, measuring up to 19
mm in greatest transverse dimension, and extending along the
left tentorium. It is consistent with a predominantly acute
subdural hematoma. This exerts mass effect upon the left
hemisphere, predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes,
with effacement of the underlying cerebral sulci and mild left
frontal edema. There is a mild rightward shift of the anterior
falx, septum pellucidum and third ventricle.
There is mild mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle. No
intraventricular hemorrhagic extension and no parenchymal
hemorrhage is
identified.
Prominence of the cerebral sulci is compatible with age-related
involutional change. Periventricular regions of hypodensity are
compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic change.
No fracture is identified. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are
well aerated. The orbits are unremarkable. Endotracheal and
nasogastric
tubes are noted.

IMPRESSION: Large acute subdural hematoma along the convexity
and tentorium, with mass effect as described above.
.
CT Head on [**1-21**] for follow up:
FINDINGS: An evolving subdural hematoma along the left cerebral
convexity
again likely extends along the left tentorium cerebelli.
Minimal, 1 mm,
rightward midline shift is unchanged. Ventricular and sulcal
caliber is
unchanged and no new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
Moderate-to-severe periventricular white matter hypodensity is
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the cavernous carotids
and intracranial vertebral arteries bilaterally. The imaged
portions of the paranasal sinuses appear well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Evolving left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma
with unchanged minimal mass effect, stable compared to the CT
from [**1-18**].
.
MRI Head:
FINDINGS: Areas of slow flow and restricted diffusion are seen
in the right posterior parietal periatrial region with high
signal on diffusion images and low signal on ADC map indicative
of acute infarcts. Small acute infarcts are also seen in right
parietal and left frontal lobes.
There is subacute subdural hematoma identified extending from
frontal to
occipital region on the left with a maximum width of
approximately 1.5 cm to 2 cm at the convexity with indentation
on the sulci. Increased signal along the sulci may indicate
small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage or stasis of the CSF
secondary to subdural. Small amount of subdural collection is
also seen along the left side of the tentorium. There is no
midline shift seen. Moderate to severe brain atrophy and
moderate changes of small vessel disease are identified. There
is no midline shift. Sagittal T2 images were obtained to
evaluate the brainstem, but are limited by motion. Changes of
cervical spondylosis are visualized, which are further evaluated
with cervical spine
MRI. Bilateral basal ganglia lacunes are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small areas of restricted diffusion in the left frontal lobe,
right
parietal lobe, and left periatrial region suggestive of embolic
infarcts.
2. Left-sided subdural hematoma extending from frontal to
occipital region
with obliteration of adjacent sulci. No midline shift. Brain
atrophy and
small vessel disease.
.
MRI C-Spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to motion. Multilevel degenerative change
is seen.
2. Moderate spinal stenosis at C4-5 and mild-to-moderate spinal
stenosis at C5-6 and C6-7 with extrinsic indentation on the
spinal cord.
3. Postoperative changes with posterior bony bar at C3-4
slightly indenting the spinal cord. Atrophic changes in the
spinal cord at C3-4 level.
.
ECHOs:
[**1-8**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
basal inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
