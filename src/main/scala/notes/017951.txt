Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyponatremia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement (removed by patient).
Right internal jugular vein hemodialysis line placement (removed
by ICU team).


History of Present Illness:
57 yo male with history of ESLD [**3-2**] HCV cirrhosis, c/b portal
hypertension with resistant ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and
recurrent hyponatremia with multiple recent admissions for
refractory hyponatremia and volume overload. On [**6-15**], he was
admitted with hyponatremia at which point tolvaptan was
increased from 30mg to 60mg and diuretics were held. Diuretics
were reinstituted prior to discharge on [**6-18**] once sodium was
125. On [**6-24**], he was readmitted for weight and hyponatremia.
Tolvapatan was continued but diuretics were held during
admission and at discharge.

He was most recently discharged on [**2185-7-2**] after an admission for
volume overload where he was found to have diastolic heart
failure as a contributing factor. He was started on torsemide
given its equal parenteral bioavailability as the patient is
known to not follow his sodium restriction at home.

The patient had routine labs drawn and was found to be
hyponatremic to 125. The patient states that he was contact[**Name (NI) **] by
[**Name (NI) 1022**] [**Name (NI) **] and told to come into the clinic, however the
patient instead called 911 and went to the [**Hospital3 **] emergency
room where he apparently had a sodium of 105. His sodium on
recheck here was 127. He is alert and oriented but incorrect in
many of his facts during interview.

In the ED, he was found to have acute kidney injury with
creatinine of 1.4, so he was given a single dose of albumin and
sent to the floor.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.

IMAGING:
[**2185-7-5**] RUQ ultrasound: 1. Limited evaluation of the left lobe of
the liver. Cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly and small volume
ascites. 2. Patent portal venous system. 3. Cholelithiasis.

[**2185-7-5**] CXR: There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
which is unchanged. There has been no interval change in the
appearance of mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vascular
markings suggestive of minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. No
focal consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The mediastinal and
hilar contours are stable. Mild degenerative changes are present
in the thoracic spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo male with hep C cirrhosis presented with hyponatremia,
mild confusion, and acute kidney injury, after very recent
hospitalization during which he was started on torsemide for
mild diastolic heart failure.

#Goals of care: During this admission it was clear on multiple
occasions that Mr. [**Known lastname 85273**] was not compliant with our treatment
recommendations. He was seen by nursing and other staff members
to go to the kitchen and bathroom and drink large amounts of
water, in regular violation of the free water restriction of
1800 mL/day. In addition, he admitted to lying about his urine
output by adding sink water to the urinal container. Lastly, he
removed his PICC line at a time when he was being treated with a
continuous furosemide infusion for volume overload. He said that
the PICC line "fell out when he was scratching his arm." Given
all of these concerns about compliance, and a long history of
such problems, the decision was made to remove Mr. [**Known lastname 85273**] from
the liver transplant list. A family meeting was held in which
immediate family members, including wife and his two daughters,
were present. At the meeting, we discussed transitioning Mr.
[**Known lastname 85273**] to comfort-directed care and making arrangements for
hospice care, either at home or at an inpatient facility. At the
time when these arrangements were being made, Mr. [**Known lastname 85273**] insisted
on leaving the hospital to go home. He was warned that we did
not feel he was medically ready to go home; he was at the time
still being treated with continuous furosemide infusion.
However, he was insistent on leaving the hospital against
medical advise. He was transitioned over to torsemide 30 mg once
daily. His tolvaptan was held. (His hyponatremia is more likely
the result of non-compliance with free water restriction, and it
is unlikely that tolvaptan will benefit him as long as he is
unable to comply with dietary recommendations). Spironolactone
was also held. Simvastatin is likely of little benefit for
primary prevention given his overall poor prognosis with
end-stage liver disease (MELD 28-29), and this medicine was also
held. The patient will go home with plans for visiting nursing
and transition to h
