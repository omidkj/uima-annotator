Admission Date:  [**2170-8-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2170-9-4**]

Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M

Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status
post coronary artery bypass graft (left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to first obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to first
diagonal, saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending
artery) in [**2168-11-3**], diabetes, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia who had been having increased fatigue over the
past few weeks.

The patient had been feeling increasingly weak in his legs.
On the morning of admission, the patient noted feeling a near
syncopal episode.  He laid down on the floor.  There was no
evidence of loss of consciousness.  No chest discomfort.  No
shortness of breath.  The patient was oriented; however, he
did feel nauseated.  The patient denied any diaphoresis or
chest pain.  The patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea;
however, he did note increased lower extremity edema over the
past week.

The patient was taken to an outside hospital where he was
noted to have ST depressions on his electrocardiogram, and he
had a hematocrit of 23.  The patient ruled in by cardiac
enzymes.  The patient was rectal guaiac-positive.  He was
started on a heparin drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 5110**] with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] denies tobacco.  He denies alcohol or intravenous drug
abuse.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient has a history of)
1.  Hypertension.

3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  History of bradycardia and syncope.
5.  History of anemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient's vital signs were stable.
His blood pressure was 116/75 and a pulse of 90.  On general
physical examination, the patient was an elderly gentleman
who was hard of hearing.  He was in no apparent distress.  He
was sitting upright eating in bed.  Neck examination was
notable for jugular venous distention approximately midway up
the neck.  Cardiovascular examination revealed distant heart
sounds.  A murmur was not audible.  Pulmonary examination
revealed mild crackles on the left side without any evidence
of wheezing.  Abdominal examination was normal.  Extremity
examination revealed 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  No cyanosis
and no edema.  Neurologic examination was grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
studies on admission were notable for a hematocrit of 24.7.
His potassium was 3.8, his blood urea nitrogen was 36, and
his creatinine was 1.6.  His calcium was 6.8, his magnesium
was 0.6, and his phosphorous was 5.9.  Creatine kinase was
1016.  His troponin was 1.03.  His CK/MB was 35.  Repeat
cardiac enzymes revealed his creatine kinase was 812.  His
troponin I was 1.74.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm, leftward axis, borderline primary
atrioventricular delay.  No ST-T wave changes.

A chest x-ray was notable for a mild congestive heart
failure.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:
The patient was admitted with acute coronary
syndrome/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Electrocardiogram changes were consistent with ischemia with
an upward trending of his troponin levels; although his
creatine kinase levels were trending down.

The patient was maintained on a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor,
and a statin.  His aspirin and heparin were held because the
patient had become intermittently become guaiac-positive as
well as a questionable episode of melena which was not
confirmed by the nursing staff.

Given the patient's history of melena, as well as
guaiac-positive status, the patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for a gastrointestinal workup.

A gastric lavage was notable for "flecks" not coffee-grounds
or blood.  No active bleeding was noted.  A Gastroenterology
consultation recommended esophagogastroduodenoscopy as an
outpatient given his current cardiopulmonary status.  The
patient was maintained on a proton pump inhibitor and serial
hematocrit levels were monitored.

The patient was transferred back to the C-MED Service.  A
cardiac catheterization was performed on [**8-28**] and
hemodynamics were not suggestive of volume overload.  His
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 13, PAD of 20, diffuse
stenoses were noted throughout the right and left coronaries
with evidence of stenoses beyond graft sites as well.  There
was no intervention at the time of catheterization, and the
patient was instructed to pursue medical management.

(b)  Pump:  There was no evidence of volume overload after
the cardiac catheterization; however, when the patient was in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he did undergo diuresis with
both Natrecor and Lasix; which were discontinued upon
transfer back to the C-MED Service.

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient was in a sinus rhythm throughout
his hospitalization, and electrocardiograms were followed.

2.  HYPOXEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's chest x-rays were
continued as well as Levaquin and Flagyl.  The patient was
able to be weaned off oxygen.

The patient's chest x-ray was notable for bilateral pleural
effusions despite diuresis.  A thoracentesis was performed
with the removal of approximately 600 cc.  There was
clear/yellow fluid removed from the right lung.  Analysis was
pending; however, this appeared to be transudative.  The
patient was able to be weaned off of oxygen.

3.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE AND CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY
ISSUES:  The patient had an improving creatinine throughout
his hospital course.  His ACE inhibitor, as well as
Glucophage, were held until resolution of his creatinine
clearance.

4.  TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was
maintained on Glyburide and an insulin sliding-scale.  He
resumed his by mouth regimen including Avandia and Glucophage
upon discharge to rehabilitation service.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia with pulmonary edema.
2.  Congestive heart failure with new mitral regurgitation.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
(a)  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
(b)  Status post cardiac catheterization during this
hospitalization for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
with evidence of stenoses through graft sites as well as
native vessels.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Diabetes.
6.  Acute-on-chronic renal failure.
7.  Gastrointestinal bleed and iron deficiency anemia; workup
pending.
8.  Transient hypocalcemia.

MAJOR SURGICAL/INVASIVE PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Cardiac catheterization.
2.  Gastric lavage.
3.  Thoracentesis of a right pleural effusion with
transudative effusion.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was weaned off oxygen.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to
pulmonary rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 700**] in
[**Location (un) 701**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Atorvastatin 10 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Metronidazole 500 mg by mouth three times per day (for
one more day).
