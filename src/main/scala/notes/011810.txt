Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness found to have right thalamic bleed,
transferred from [**Hospital3 **]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 42461**] is an 87 y.o. Polish speaking right handed woman,
with a past medical history of 2 distinct strokes (left MCA 7y.
ago and right PCA 2 y. ago), afib currently on coumadin,
hypertension and fibromyalgia, who presented to [**Hospital1 42462**] this morning because of difficulty moving her left
side, left gaze paralysis and worsening dysarthria.

She was in her usual state of health last night when she went to
bed at 10:00 pm. She lives with her daugher and her dauther's
husband. At around 7am, when her daughter went to check on her,
she found her in bed unable to stand up and not moving her left
side, with her eyes deviated to the right. She was alert and
talking to her daughter, but with more dysarthria.
She was taken to [**Hospital1 **] hospital, where her SBP was found to be
239. INR was 3.3, and head CT showed acute right thalamic
hemorrhage, with no midline shift, but blood present in the
aqueduct.
She received 10mg of vitamin K IV, 2 doses of 20mg Labetalol IV,
1 unit of FFP, 500mg of IV Keppra, and was transferred to us for
further management.

She denies headaches, nausea or vomiting. At baseline, her blood
pressure ranges in the 120's over 80's.

At her baseline, she has right sided weakness secondary to her
left MCA stroke in addition to expressive aphasia. She has
intact comprehension and mental status except for not knowing
what date it is. She does speak in full sentences, but has some
paraphasic erros.

In our ED, she was started on Nicardipine drip to maintain
SBP<150, received factor IX. Head CT was reordered.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
 No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

answering questions appropriately, sighltly more disarthric than
baseline but per daughter, does not have her dentures,
 Able to relate history without difficulty. Language is fluent

midline and appendicular commands.
-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 2 to 1.5mm and minimally reactive.  VFF to
confrontation on the right only.
III, IV, VI:eyes deviated to the right, with left gaze paresis.

Motor
Increased tone in right upper and lower extremities, with
strength ranging from 4 to 4+/5 on the right side, distal better
than proximal, but I was unable to test single muscle groups as
she did not follow all my commands.
She can raise her left arm at least against gravity, did not
follow my commands to activate biceps/triceps/wrist extensors or
flexors, but is spontaneously moving these muscle groups at
least against gravity. She has a weak grip of [**3-25**]. She raises
her left lower extremity against gravity, distally her strength
is [**4-25**] in dorsiflexion and plantar flexsion.

-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, but unable to test for
DSS.
-DTRs: [**Name2 (NI) **] throughout, with 2 beats of knee clonus on the

Imaging:

CT head [**2193-9-3**]

FINDINGS:  Again seen are old infarcts in the left parietal and
right
cerebellar regions.  The previously seen right thalamic
hemorrhage has increased in size and now has extension into the
ventricular system.  Blood is seen within the lateral
ventricles, the third ventricle, in the aqueduct.
There is also slight increase in the size of the ventricles.
The basal cisterns appear patent and there is preservation of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation.

No bony abnormalities are identified.  The visualized paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.
The globes are unremarkable.

CT head [**2193-9-5**]
Stable appearance of right thalamic hemorrhage with extension
into the ventricular system.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 42461**] is an 87 y.o. Polish speaking right handed woman,
with a past medical history of 2 ischemic strokes (left MCA 7yrs
ago and right PCA 2 yrs ago), afib on coumadin, question of CHF,
hypertension and fibromyalgia who presented with left sided
weakness , found to have an acute right thalamic hemorrhage in
the context of elevated BP (SBP 239) and INR of 3.3.

The patient admitted to Neuro ICU
 Repeat INR s/p vit K and 1u of ffps was 2 so received factor IX
in ED. Her SBP in the ED ranged between 130-160s and she was
started on Nicardipine. Her new deficits consist of left gaze
paresis, left orbicularis oculi weakness, new left sided
weakness. Repeat CT on [**9-3**] afternoon showed extension of
hemorrhage but no evidence of midline shift. Clinically, pt was
more lethargic on arrival to the ICU compared to in the morning
in the ED. She was monitored in the neuro ICU and required a
nicardipine drip to maintain goal SBP<160.  This was d/c'ed on
morning of [**9-4**].  That afternoon, she went into afib with RVR
and required a diltiazem drip.  Neuro wise, she became a bit
less lethargic and was transferred to the floor.  Patient had
made it very clear that she did not want any surgical procedures
and not even an NG tube in prior conversations with the
daughter. [**Name (NI) **] failed speech and swallow. Of note, prednisone
was held in the setting of a bleed.
On admission, patient was DNI/DNR, does not wish to h
