Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year-old male with a history of afib, PEs while on
coumadin, pulmonary hypertension and hypothyroidism who is
admitted with shock on pressors.
EMS was initially called as the patient was experiencing extreme
fatigue over the last 2 days which had become progressively
worse. EMS reports that the patient was AAOx2, eyes open, no
complaints other than weakness. He denied n/v/d, headache, chest
pain, fever, chills, abdominal pain. He was able to follow
commands. Initial ECG showed 2nd degree AV block per report.
Fluid boluses were given without improvement, so atropine 0.5 mg
IV x1 was given which improved his heart rate. As his BP began
to fall, dopamine was infused peripherally at 10 mcg/min with
improvement in BP on arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
.
In the ED at [**Location (un) 620**], the patient was continued on dopamine and
was given ctx 1 gm IV, levaquin 750 mg IV, and vancomycin 1 gm
IV. He additionally rec'd 1 unit of prbcs and dexamethazone 10
mg IV for possible adrenal insufficiency. He was also given an
additional 3L NS with minimal increase in BP. A trial of
levophed at 10 mcg/min resulted in decreased BPs to the 60s, so
the patient was placed back on dopamine with BPs in the 110s.
.
As the patient refused an IJ for access, a femoral line was
placed to continue pressor support. He was transferred on 10
mcg/kg.
.
Of note, the patient had a recent admission in [**Month (only) 359**] of this
year to [**Hospital3 **] for hypotension. He was admitted to the
ICU. He had a TTE at that time showing EF of 65% and RV
dysfunction, not significantly changed from prior. A chest CT
showed inflammatory/infectious etiology and sputum cultures grew
Serratia marcescens and citrobactor amalonaticus. Repeat imaging
and bronchoscopy yielded evidence of likely COP. He was started
on prednisone for concerns of COP/BOOP and amiodarone was
discontinued due to concerns of pulmonary toxicity. He was also
fluid overloaded during the admission given his hypotension and
ICU stay and was diuresed prior to discharge.

ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

On Presentation:

GEN: NAD, ill appearing

HEENT: dry MM, cobblestone appearance of lower oral mucosa with
poor dentition but not clear evidence of abscess or infection at
RL mandible
CV: regaulr rate
PULM: rales/rhonchi at bilateral bases
ABD: soft, NTND
EXT: knee with open wound/crusted serous material surroundign
wound, no pus apparent, L knee with well-healed wound, stage 2

Pertinent Results:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
The distal apex has relatively normal function. There is
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, likely secondary to
ventricular dilatation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension
(likely UNDERestimated - given severity of tricuspid
regurgitation, the right atrial pressure is likely substantially
greater than 10mm Hg.). There is evidence of pressure and volume
overload of the right ventricle with a small, normally
functioning left ventricle.

CT HEAD:
1. Unchanged rounded 9 mm right frontal extra-axial
hyperdensity, more likely representing a small meningioma than a
subdural hematoma. Further evaluation by head MRI with and
without contrast is suggested.

2. Resolution of previously noted gas in the masticator spaces,
infratemporal fossae and temporomandibular joints.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year-old male with a history of PEs, pulmonary hypertension,
COP, chronic knee infection, afib/flutter and hypothyroidism who
is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with shock and acute renal
failure.  Shock was thought to be his end stage pulmonary
hypertension and right ventricular failure which significantly
improved by increasing his dose of sildenafil to 100mg tid.
Family meeting held to address goals of care given the end stage
nature of his disease in spite of his improvement on increased
dose of sildenafil.  The decision was made to transition him to
home hospice.  He was discharged home in stable condition with
home hospice.

#  Goals of Care:  Family meeting held to discuss goals of care
and prognosis.  Outcome of discussion was to attempt to wean
patient off of pressors in and transition him to home hospice.
Discussed medication regimen at length with team and the
following decisions were made:
1. Continue sildenafil at 100mg tid to treat his RV failure,
keep him off pressors and allow him to go home with hospice
2. Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued as has been no
clear infection.  Oral Bactrim for prophylaxis continued.
3. Weaned off stress dose steroids and will continue oral
prednisone for COP.
4. Coumadin discontinued given patient was guaiac (+) as OSH
given risk of bleed. Patient does have hisotry of PE while on
anti-coagulation.

# Shock NOS:  Thought to be secondary to RV failure (chronic)
and sub-optimally treated pulmonary hypertension as patient has
not desired full treatment in the past.  Patient with
leukocytosis which is likely [**2-28**] to stress dose steroids as not
clinically systemically infected.  Initially on pressors which
have been able to be weaned off with increased dose of
sildenafil at 100mg tid. P  Patient with extremely poor forward
flow and has little ability to maintain blood pressures with
changes in posture.  Physical therapy saw him and patient was
able to ambulate safely.

# Hyperkalemia: Potassium elevated at 6.8 on admission. Resolved
with kayexalate and lactulose.

# Acute Renal Failure:  Secondary to decreased perfusion in
setting of shock. Improving. Renally dosed meds. Avoid
nephrotoxins. Has low Ca, did not work up given goals of care.

# Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: Steroid dependent since
[**Month (only) 359**], has been unable to wean below 10 mg daily.  Was treated
with stress dose steroid initially which are currently being
weans down with transition to oral prednisone prior to
discharge.  Continued Bactrim for prophylaxis.

# Leukocytosis: Stable, likely  [**2-2
