Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base / Vitamin K Analogues

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 82 yo woman with PMH CAD s/p CABG, s/p MV repair
(for MVP with MR) in [**2170**] who presents with c/o increased SOB
from baseline over past 3 days.  Per patient and family, reports
at baseline, pt experiences SOB with exertion, including
climbing stairs.  However, over the past 3 days, patient has
been experiencing increased SOB, so that she appears SOB with
talking, with sitting down, etc.  Patient denies any chest
pain/pressure, orthopnea, PND, weight gain, LE swelling,
although does say she used to get those symptoms prior to her MV
repair.  Other than the SOB, patient reports + diaphoresis at
night (which she reports also noting prior to her MV repair),
feeling weak and tired, decreased appetite.  Family denies any
change in mental status.
.
Of note patient's recent medication changes include:  HCTZ
started 1.5-2 mos ago.  Otherwise no medication changes.  Per
patient's family, she does not always take her medications,
including her potassium.
.
Also of note, patient and her family report patient had a
mechanical fall 3 days ago, which they also say was the onset of
her symptoms, although they do think it is coincidental.  The
fall is reported as mechanical as pt tripped over the rug.  No
LOC, did not hit her head, no change in MS or balance since that
time.
.
In ED, patient received in EKG which did not show any ST
changes, 1 set negative CE (trop = 0.02, CK 39).  Labs notable
for CR to 1.3 from baseline 0.8, K 2.4, D dimer 997.   Pt was
given ASA, started on Hep gtt (in case ACS), given 80mg PO Kcl.
.
Currently pt denies SOB (although appears tachypnic).  Just c/o
weakness and feeling tired.  ROS otherwise as above.


Past Medical History:
1.) CAD s/p CABG ([**2170**] - also took sample of chamber wall as
appeared to be atrial myxoma, although pathology diagnosed
organized thrombus) - c/b sternal staph infection (oxacillin
sensitive staph aereus) - therefore sternum removed w/
latissimus dorsi flap over sternal area.
2.) MV repair - Corkscrew # 30 mitral annuloplasty ring ([**2170**] at
same time as CABG above)
3.) Hx of paroxysmal A Fib
4.) Dementia (early alzheimer's)
5.) s/p cholecystectomy
6.) s/p TAH


Social History:
Lives next door to son and daughter
[**Name (NI) **] etoh  No drugs  No smoking

Family History:
Father died at 61 with MI

Physical Exam:
In ED:
T:95.3  HR: 92  BP: 116/66  RR: 25  O2 sat: 97% on 4L
AAO x3, hard of hearing
HEENT: PERRL EOMI
Neck: Supple
Resp: crackles 1/3 up base
CV: Systolic murmur, RR
Abd: Soft NTND +Bs
GU: No CVA tenderness
Ext: No LE edema +DP pulses B/L
Skin: No rashes
Neuro: No focal numbness or weakness

Pertinent Results:
[**11-12**] CXR: The heart is enlarged. Pulmonary vascular markings are
increased with Kerley B lines evident. There is no focal
consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. Osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
CHF.
.
[**2180-11-14**]: REnal US:
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.3 cm. Within the
upper pole of the right kidney is a 0.7 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm simple
cyst. Within the right lobe of the liver is an 1.2 x 0.7 x 1 cm
simple cyst. The left kidney measures 10 cm. There are no renal
masses, stones, or hydronephrosis. The bladder contains a Foley
catheter is otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Simple right renal and right hepatic cysts.
.
ECHO: [**2179-11-15**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The
right atrium is markedly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function may be more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve is redundant and thick. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is
present. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion
.
[**2179-11-18**]: CT head with contrast:
CONCLUSION: Limited study due to motion artifact. No large
intracranial hemorrhage is identified. No gross intracranial
mass effect is evident. A 7.5-mm lytic lesion at the right
parietal bone may represent a venous [**Doctor Last Name **], although a metastatic
deposit cannot be excluded and can be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting.
.
[**11-21**]: CXR:
FINDINGS: Again seen is an endotracheal tube with tip 4.8 cm
above the carina. The tip of the endotracheal tube is pressing
against the right lateral wall of the trachea and deviating it
slightly. The NG tube is in the stomach. There is a Swan-Ganz
catheter with tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. There is
increased hazy opacity in bilateral lower lungs, left greater
than right, and also in the low left mid lung suggesting patchy
focal infiltrates. These have increased compared to the prior
day. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**11-28**]: RUQ US
IMPRESSION:
1. Gallbladder not visualized. Is this patient status post
cholecystectomy?
2. Multiple anechoic lesions in the liver consistent with cysts
with one of these lesions suggestive of a septated cyst.
3. No biliary ductal dilatation
.
[**2179-12-3**]: CT Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.

2. Status post CABG with median sternotomy, with unchanged
appearance of the sternum. Marked cardiomegaly with marked right
atrial enlargement.

3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased compared to the
prior study.

4. Increased ground glass opacity with interlobular septal
thickening in bilateral lungs, which probably representing
worsening pulmonary edema. More confluent opacities in bilateral
upper lobes, also increased compared to the prior study, which
may represent infectious process such as multifocal pneumonia.
Please correlate clinically.
.
[**2179-12-3**]: CXR:
IMPRESSION: Increased patchy pulmonary alveolar opacities
consistent with worsening failure.
.
[**2179-12-5**]:
An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.5 cm above the
carina. It points toward the right mainstem bronchus and close
followup is therefore recommended. An NG tube is present, tip
beneath diaphragm extending off film. Right IJ central line is
present, tip overlying SVC/RA junction.

There is moderate cardiomegaly. There are patchy interstitial
and alveolar infiltrates, diffusely throughout both lungs. These
appear somewhat less confluent than on the film from one day
earlier, particularly in the left upper zone. No effusions are
identified.

IMPRESSION: Diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltrates, with
slight interval improvement compared with one day earlier. Lines
and tubes as described.
