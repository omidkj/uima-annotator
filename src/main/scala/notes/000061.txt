Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
low back pain
vaginal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ultrasound guided D+C

History of Present Illness:
     26 yo G1P1 s/p NSVD 9 weeks ago w/ persistent LBP, low
grade fevers and some vaginal bleeding.  She presented to
[**Hospital 1562**] [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2164-9-7**] and had a D&C & hysteroscopy and
was sent home.  She developed nausea, vomiting and epigastric
abdominal pain that radiated to her back and presented to
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2164-9-8**].
     At [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, she had a chest CT that was
unremarkable.  3 hrs post-IV contrast and 45min post-phenergan
she developed acute respiratory distress and was intubated. She
received solumedrol, sc epinephrine, benadryl.   She was
hypertensive to the 150/100's and a subsequent CXR showed
pulmonary edema.  She was transferred to the ICU.
     CTA on [**9-9**] was neg for PE, pos for b/l pleural effusions
and pulmonary edema.  She was diuresed, and her cardiac enzymes
were noted to be elevated.  A TTE at that time was notable for
EF 40%, and her enzymes were attributed to demand ischemia and
diastolic dysfunction.  CXray w/ pulm edema and pt transfered
[**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**9-17**]: Neck U/S: Negative ultrasound of the right neck, without
evidence of vascular occlusion, dissection, or gross neck mass.

[**9-12**]:Pelvic U/S: Vascular, echogenic and shadowing structure
within the uterine cavity. Given the vascularity, the findings
are concerning for retained products of conception.

[**9-11**]: CT Chest w/o contrast:
1) Diffuse bilateral pulmonary consolidative opacities, which
may represent a
multifocal pneumonia or ARDS. Moderate sized bilateral pleural
effusions are
present.

2) Ill-defined pancreas with associated peripancreatic fat
stranding
consistent with acute pancreatitis. No focal fluid collections
are present.

3) Non-obstructing, small, right renal calculus.

4) High density material within the uterine cavity likely
representing
residual blood products.

[**9-10**]: TTE:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
3. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2164-9-12**]: Pathology- Product of conception:

1.  Necrotic calcified and hyalinized  placental tissue.
2.  Implantation site fragments.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Distress - the patient arrived to the ICU
intubated.  Chest x-ray w/ bilateral interstitial infiltrates.
Etiology likely multifactorial including ARDS secondary to
pancreatitis/retained products of conception and pulmonary edema
given cardiac EF of 35%.  Over the course in the ICU, the
patients pulmonary status rapidly improved w/ diuresis. She was
extubated on HD 3. On HD 5, she was transferred to the floor on
6L nasal cannula. She continued to receive gentle diuresis while
on the floor. By HD 6, she only required 3L nasal cannula and by
HD7, she had oxygen saturation of 96-99% on Room Air. She no
longer received diuresis on her last hospital day. On discharge,
her oxygen saturation was 98-99% on Room Air. She will have a
follow up [**Month/Day/Year 113**] in [**12-20**] weeks to evaluate for resolution of her
cardiomyopathy.

2. Fever - the likely source of the patient's fever was
pancreatitis and/or the her retained products of conception. The
patient was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics
including zosyn, clindamycin, and doxcycline. As culture data
returned her antibiotic regimen was weaned appropriately. On HD
7, she was changed from IV meds to po levo/flagyl for possible
pneumonia vs myometritis. Since she had no
laboratory/radiological evidence of either condition, her
antibiotics were stopped on HD 8. She remained afebrile off of
antibiotics.

3. Pancreatitis - On admission, the patient was kept NPO w/ NG
tube to suction. By hospital day 3 the patient was having bowel
movements and with no abdominal pain.  She was started on a
regular diet which she tolearted well. The pt did not have
further nausea/abdominal pain. Although her amylase/lipase
trended up throughout the admission, she was not symptomatic so
it was decided to stop trending her enzymes. She was seen by GI
the day before discharge and it was decided that she should
follow up for an MRCP then with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] for o/p work up of
the etiology of her pancreatitis.

4. Anemia - The patient was given several units of blood (total
6U) for low blood counts while she was in the ICU.  It was
thought that the etiology of her anemia was a combination of low
grade DIC (as her platelets also decreased, her DDimer was
elevated and her fibrinogen nadired at 250) and blood loss
during her U/S guided D+C. She was transferred to the floor on
[**9-14**] (HD 5) and from that point on her hematocrit was stable
between 25-28. She did not require any blood transfusions while
on the floor.

5. Thrombocytopenia- On admission, the patient's platelets were
44. The differential for her low platelets included DIC, HIT (pt
given lovenox) and HELLP. Her PTT/INR was 22.3/1.5,D-dimer 4514,
fibrinogen-258 which was suggestive of low grade DIC (although
if truly DIC picture would expect fibrinogen to be lower).  A
HIT antibody was sent which was negative. The timing and
clinical picture (9 wks s/p SVD and no labs suggestive of
hemolysis, no hypertension) was less consistent with HELLP
syndrome. Her platelets trended up throughout the admission. At
discharge, the patient's platelets were 480.

6. ARF - the patient's baseline creatine is 0.5 and at admission
was 1.2.  Initial urine lytes before hydration were consistent
w/ a pre-renal picture.  Subsequently, however, muddy brown
casts consistent with ATN were noted in the patient's urine.
Over the course of her ICU stay, the patients Cr trended
downward as she autodiuresed well. Her creatinine remained at
her baseline on her last three hospital days.

7. Hyperthyroidism-On admission, the patient was tachycardic
~130s (sinus). It was thought that the tachycardia was secondary
to volume depletion vs infection. Her HR ranged from 100-170s,
but trended in 100-120s with gentle hydration/antibiotics. On
the day of transfer to the floor, the patient remained in the
120s so other sources of sinus tachycardia, including thyroid
function, were evaluated. Her TSH was <0.02 and her free T4 was
elevated. She was started on low dose beta-blocker for control
of her heart rate. It was titrated
