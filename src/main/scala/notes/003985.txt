History of Present Illness:

HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 88506**] is a 66 year old M
w/ h/o pancreatic CA s/p sphincterotomy [**12-15**] and chemotherapy
with gemcitabine and erlotinib, DM type 2, and CAD s/p MI and
PCI/stent [**2167**] who is transferred from OSH with acute inferior
STEMI. Patient presented to [**Hospital3 8544**] the afternoon of
admission with chest pain, onset around noon and radiation to
neck and left arm. Pain occurred at rest and was worse with
inspiration. Associated with SOB, no nausea or vomiting. Of
note, reported some pleuritic symptoms several days prior to
this episode, though not as intense. Pain was [**9-14**] at its worst.
Presented to OSH where EKGs were remarkable for STE and small q
waves in II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST depressions in I and
aVL. Patient was given asa, plavix 300, and started on a heparin
drip. He was given nitro x 3 without relief of his symptoms and
subsequently started on a nitro drip. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] patient was taken straight to cath lab.
Vitals at that time were HR 109, BP 128/68 RR 19 O2 sat 99%.
Cardiac catheterization showed a right dominant system with
total occlusion of RCA, minimal disease in the remaining
vessels. The lesion was apparently difficult to cross and
behaved more like a chronic TO than an acute lesion. He
underwent balloon dilation and then two bare metal stents were
placed in the proximal and mid RCA.
.
In the CCU, patient reported pain improved, but continued
pleuritic pain in his upper chest/neck with inspiration and
burping. [**3-10**] in intensity. Denied cough, hemoptysis,
hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rashes. Reports
has been active at home, walking around and driving more than in
recent times. ROS is negative for diarrhea, black stools, bloody
stools, and fevers. +Chills.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
1 vessel coronary artery disease. The LM, LAD and LCx had
minimal
disease. The RCA was totally occluded proximally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure of 133/53mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Bare metal stents placed in a patient with presumed STEMI
with ST
elevation in 3 and F.
2. He is still c/o of pleuritic chest pain. A spiral CT must be
obtained
to r/o PE as this may have been a chronic TO.
3. ASA and clopidogrel for as long as a year if he can tolerate
it, but
no less than a month.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferolateral akinesis, c/w RCA disease. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. Ther
