Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
generalized swelling and respiratory discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**7-14**]
extubation [**7-16**]

History of Present Illness:
CC: admitted to MICU [**7-11**] for hyponatremia, called out to the
floor [**7-12**], back to MICU [**7-14**] for altered mental status,
respiratory stress and fever
.
HPI
Please see the MICU note for more details. Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 65646**]
is
a 69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, Prostate CA on
suppresive therapy since [**2154**], cryptogenic cirrhosis, large
ingunoscrotal hernia, and long-standing scrotal edema who
presented from his group home with increased LE and scrotal and
was admitted to MICU for hyponatremia on [**7-11**]. Hyponatremia
improved with lasix diuresis and he was sent to the floor the
next day [**7-12**]. He was doing well for the next 2 days but then was
found to minimally responsive, obtunded, febrile and hypoxic to
the 70s (came back to low 90s on NRB) when he was receiving an
infusion of albumin, so he was transfered back to the MICU on
[**7-14**]
for hypoxia and altered mental status.
.
On transfer to MICU on [**7-14**], he was noted to be obtunded with
thick secretions. His O2 requirement escalated to 100% NRB to
maintain sats in the high 80s. ABG at that point showed
respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia and the decision was made
to intubate him for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure. Pt
was successfully extubated on [**7-16**], and has been requiring 4-6
liters of O2 since.
.
Sputum culture grew streptococcus pneumoniae on [**7-14**]. Pt was
bronched on [**7-15**] which revealed thick plugs throughout right
airways with purulent drainage distally; BAL and washings were
sent but no microorg seen on gram stain or in culture.
.
Currently, pt complains of some shortness of breath on 5 liters
of oxygen. No chest pain or palpitations. No pain anywhere. He
is
complaining of increased lower extremity edema, and said his
scrotal edema has been stable for many years.


Past Medical History:
- Schizophrenia (followed by psychiatrist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 65647**])
- Prostate Ca on lupron since [**2154**]
- Anemia of chronic disease with macrocytosis.
- Cryptogenic cirrhosis, followed by the liver center until
recently, but he no longer wishes to see hepatology.  It is
thought to be probably secondary to prior alcohol abuse.
Appt w/ Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10285**] made for thurs [**7-28**]
- COPD
- obesity
- prostate cancer
- compression fracture status post vertebroplasty.
- very large inguinoscrotal hernia, for which he has deferred
surgery. (loops of bowel are in his scrotum)
- Pyruvate kinase deficiency
- splenomegaly
- status post cholecystectomy

Social History:
Lives at a group home for his schizophrenia ([**Street Address(1) 65648**])
which has help daily, but not at night.  Ex-wife [**Name (NI) 2411**] is still
quite involved. Smokes 1 PPD for "a long time".  Denies alcohol
use, but past history of alcohol use is noted.  Denies other
drugs.


Family History:
He has 4 sisters that he does not keep in regular contact with.
Unsure of what his parents died from.

[**2157-7-12**] CT ABD/PELV: IMPRESSION:
1. No hyperenhancing hepatic mass.
2. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension,
as described above.
3. Stable left adrenal nodule, likely a fat-containing adrenal
nodule.
4. Stable diffuse right adrenal thickening, likely related to
hyperplasia.

[**7-13**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
Moderate new right sided pleural effusion and diffuse middle and
lower lobe consolidation is most likely due a developing
pneumonia secondary to aspiration with a diagnosis of
assymetrical edema less likely


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo man with hx of schizophrenia, COPD, prostate ca, and
cryptogenic cirrhosis presents with anasarca and profound
scrotal edema.
.
Pneumonia: Patient was febrile with tachycardia and hypoxia on
[**2157-7-13**] prompting transfer to the MICU. Patient with new
infiltrates on CXR c/w pneumonia. He required intubation for
hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure.  He was started on
vanc/zosyn/levo, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1066**] showed extensive mucous plugging
which was cleared out with resolution of atelectasis and
mediastinal shift.  He was extubated after 2 days and quickly
weaned to 4 L NC. Evaluated by speech and swallow who
recommended
continuing PO diet of thin liquids (single sips), regular
solids, whole pills with puree, and strict aspiration
precautions. Vanc was discontinued on [**2157-7-18**] due to concern for
leukopenia and as MRSA screen negative. He completed an 8-day
course of cefepime for hospital acquired v. aspiration pneumonia
on [**2157-7-21**].
.
Lower Extremity Edema:  Likely related to liver cirrhosis. BNP
elevated at 2207 but no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram showed moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension
which could be an etiology of right sided failure.  He has known
cryptogenic cirrhosis (unclear etiology) which could lead to
elevated portal pressures.  Dopper ultrasound without evidence
of  portal/splenic venous thrombosis.  Lower extremity
ultrasounds negative for DVT.  TSH and cortisol are within
normal limits.  Al
