Date of Birth:   [**2115-2-9**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old
gentleman with a history of hyperlipidemia who was
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for evaluation of chest
pain with electrocardiogram changes.

The patient was in his usual state of health until in the
morning of [**2170-3-11**] when he awoke with severe
substernal chest pain across his chest bilaterally with
radiation to both arms.  He also complained of severe
diaphoresis; however, he denied shortness of breath, nausea
or vomiting.  He took aspirin and Mylanta which resolved the
pain in approximately one hour.  This pain recurred again the
next night while sleeping.  He again took Mylanta and aspirin
with some improvement but without complete resolution of the
pain.  This morning he awoke at 3 a.m., again with chest
pain.  He went to his primary care physician's office where
an electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in the inferior
leads.  He was seen by a cardiologist and sent immediately to
the [**Hospital6 33**] Emergency Room for further
evaluation.  The patient was started on aspirin, heparin,
Integrilin drip and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**].

The patient currently denies any complaints with no
recurrence of the chest pain or shortness of breath.  He
denies any cough, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea,
vomiting, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and lower
extremity edema.  He does note worsening dyspnea on exertion
when traversing two flights of stairs.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Hyperlipidemia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history positive is positive to
tobacco use times 40 years.  He currently smokes one to two
packs per day.  He quit two to three days ago.  He
occasionally drinks alcohol.  He works as a plumber.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs with blood pressure of 102/69, heart
rate of 89, respiratory rate of 16, satting 97% on 2 liters.
In general, he was a well-developed male who was awake,
alert, and in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx
was clear.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Neck revealed he had no
jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.  His lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second
heart sound.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
Abdomen revealed he had good bowel sounds, was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  He had a small umbilical
hernia.  Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurologically,
he was alert and oriented times three.  He had no focal
neurologic findings.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratories
revealed a white blood cell count of 18.5, hematocrit
of 44.1, platelets of 310.  Sodium of 142, potassium of 4.3,
chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 23, blood urea nitrogen of
19, creatinine of 0.9, glucose of 109.  INR of 1.2, PTT
of 65.9.  Creatine kinases were 2172, with a MB of 231, and
an MB index of 10.6.  His magnesium was 2.3, phosphorous
was 4.1.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His electrocardiogram revealed that he
was in normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 93.  He had a
normal axis and intervals.  He had poor R wave progression
with Q waves in leads V3 and aVF.  He had 1-mm ST elevations
in II, III, and aVF with slight ST elevations in V4 through
V3.  He had T wave inversions in leads II, III, and F, along
with V3 through V6.  He had no ST elevations in leads V4R.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The next morning the patient had a cardiac
catheterization which revealed a 30% proximal and 20% distal
left main coronary artery lesion, a 90% proximal and 40%
middle left anterior descending artery lesion.  A stent was
placed to the 90% proximal left anterior descending artery
lesion.  His left circumflex had mild-to-moderate disease.
The right coronary artery was occluded which was filled by
collaterals from the left anterior descending artery and left
circumflex.

His post catheterization course was complicated by
cardiogenic shock.  He was transferred back to the Coronary
Care Unit post catheterization requiring dopamine and
dobutamine drips as well as a intra-aortic balloon pump; all
for cardiogenic shock.  He was quickly weaned off dobutamine
and dopamine, and his intra-aortic balloon pump was
discontinued after 48 hours.  An echocardiogram was obtained
which revealed that his left atrium was mildly dilated.  He
had mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  His left
ventricular cavity was moderately dilated.  His overall left
ventricular systolic function was severely depressed with an
ejection fraction of 20%.  There were regional resting wall
motion abnormalities including intraseptal and inferior
akinesis with diffuse hypokinesis with a basal, inferior
aneurysm, and apical dyskinesis.  The remaining left
ventricular segments were found to hypokinetic.  The right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal,
and there was moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation, and no
evidence of pericardial effusion.

Because the patient had multiple runs of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia coupled with an extremely low
ejection fraction, the electrophysiology team was consulted
for a possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
placement.  In the Electrophysiology Laboratory, the patient
was positive for inducible ventricular tachycardia.  Due to a
question of urinary tract infection, he was started on
levofloxacin, and his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
was successfully implanted the next day.  A chest x-ray the
next day confirmed proper lead positioning, and the
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was also interrogated
with no signs of any malfunction.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition at the time of discharge
was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lovenox injections until his INR is greater than 2.
2.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. (with INR to be followed up in
the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic).
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.6h. times 48 hours.
5.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q.h.s.
8.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times 30 days.
9.  Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every five
minutes times three p.r.n. for chest pain.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:   Return to the Emergency Room if you
develop any worsening shortness of breath or return of any
chest pain.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Follow up with your cardiologist and
primary care physician in one week.  Please follow up in the
Device Clinic on [**2170-3-28**] at 10:30 at the seventh
floor of the [**Last Name (un) 469**] Building.  Please have your INR checked
as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post large anterior
myocardial infarction with stent placement to left anterior
descending artery.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, status post
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
