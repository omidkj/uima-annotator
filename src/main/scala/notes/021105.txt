discomfort.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 69-year-old man with known
cardiac risk factors, who has had increasing exertional chest
discomfort. It recently progressed to at rest. The patient
had a positive VTT test and was referred for cardiac
catheterization, which revealed a 60% left main, 80% to 95%
LAD and a normal left circumflex with a 99% lesion and 2
small OM branches with diffuse disease, an RCA that had been
previously stented, and a 90% distal stent stenosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, coronary
artery disease, status post stent in [**2154**] and again in [**2160**],
PVD with lower extremity claudication, GERD, kidney stones,
status post cystoscopy in [**2164**], left hip pain, glaucoma and
bilateral cataracts. Current tobacco smoker.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for right inguinal hernia
repair, surgical correction of an undescended testicle and
bilateral cataract surgery.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married with several children. He is a
retired police officer. Tobacco 1-1/2 packs per day x52
years. The patient quit after cardiac catheterization, so was
tobacco free for 2 weeks prior to his surgery. Rare alcohol
use, less than 2 drinks per month.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Both parents with heart disease diagnosed in
their 50's and 60's. No other facts known.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  His meds prior to admission included aspirin
325 daily, Nitro patch 0.4 mg per hour daily, Norvasc 2.5
daily, Propranolol 80 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 daily, Imdur 30
daily, Trental 400 t.i.d., and Alphagan eye drops 0.15 to the
right eye b.i.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.8, hematocrit 37.1, platelets
201. Sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 106, CO2 26, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 148, ALT 21, AST 14, alkaline
phosphatase 97, total bilirubin 0.4, CK 112, albumin 3.2. PT
12.8, PTT 28.8, INR 1.1.

EKG sinus rhythm 62 beats per minute.

Carotid ultrasound no significant disease.

Noninvasive lower extremity ultrasound, right saphenous
occlusion with significant tibial peroneal disease, moderate
left saphenous occlusive disease with moderate tibial
peroneal disease.

It should be noted that the patient's EF at cardiac
catheterization was 60%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, the patient was
admitted as a direct admission to the operating room, where
he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Please see the
OR report for full details. In summary he had a CABG x4 with
LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM, saphenous vein
graft to PDA, and saphenous vein graft to PLV. His bypass
time was 98 minutes with a cross clamp time of 80 minutes. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. At
the time of transfer he was in sinus rhythm at 80 beats per
minute with a mean arterial pressure of 86, and a CVP of 90.
He had Neo-Synephrine at 0.8 mics per kilogram and
epinephrine at 0.01 mics per kilogram per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His anesthesia was reversed. His sedation was discontinued.
He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
He remained hemodynamically stable on the postoperative day,
and on postoperative day 1 was weaned from his Neo-
Synephrine, as well as his epinephrine drips. His PA catheter
was removed. The central line was changed to a triple lumen
catheter, and he was transferred to the floor for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days the patient remained
hemodynamically stable. His beta blockade was increased. He
was diuresed over several days. His activity level was
increased with the assistance of the nursing staff, as well
as with physical therapy staff. On postoperative day 6 it was
decided that the following day the patient would be stable
and ready for discharge to home.

At the time of this dictation the patient's physical exam is
as follows: Temperature 99.4. Heart rate 80, sinus rhythm.
Blood pressure 118/70. Respiratory rate 18. O2 saturation 97%
on room air.

Lab data, sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 103, CO2 31,
BUN 20, creatinine 0.8, glucose 108. White count 10.5,
hematocrit 27.7, platelets 200.

Chest x-ray on the [**11-6**] showed a small left
apical pneumothorax, as well as a small left basilar
effusion. Weight preoperatively 97 kilos, at the time of
discharge 104 kilos.

Physical exam: Neuro: alert and oriented x3. He moves all
extremities, follows commands, a nonfocal exam. Pulmonary:
Lungs are clear, but diminished in the left lower lobe.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 with no murmur.
Sternum is stable. Incision clean and dry with no drainage or
erythema. Abdomen: Soft and nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2 to 3+ edema. The left leg incision from the
saphenous vein graft harvesting is clean and dry with Steri-
Strips.

The patient's condition at the time of discharge is good. He
is to be discharged home with visiting nurses. He is to have
followup in the wound clinic in 2 weeks. Follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 to 4 weeks, and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4
weeks.
