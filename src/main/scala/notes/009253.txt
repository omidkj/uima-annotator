OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
gentleman with a distal esophageal adenocarcinoma. His
endoscopic ultrasound stage was T2, N0. He was brought to the
operating room today for esophageal resection. Preoperatively
I reviewed with the patient and his wife [**Name (NI) **] the risks of
the proposed operation. We specifically discussed the risk of
anastomotic leak, bleeding, need for reoperation, respiratory
failure, myocardial infarction and death.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the
operating room and placed supine on the operating table.
After identifying the patient appropriately, he was intubated
with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. The position of this
tube was confirmed bronchoscopically.

We performed a surgical time-out and then inserted the
flexible gastroscope transorally. We noted the esophageal
tumor at 37 cm. We also noted Barrett's esophagus that extended
to approximately 35 cm from the incisors. The stomach and
remainder of the esophagus appeared normal. We decompressed
the stomach and removed the gastroscope. We then prepped and
draped the abdomen in usual sterile fashion. We made a
cutdown port in the left upper quadrant. We inserted the
[**Last Name (un) 24631**] trocar and established pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg. We
inserted a laparoscope and evaluated the peritoneal cavity.
We observed no evidence of metastatic disease on this
laparoscopic survey. We then placed 4 additional ports in the
usual configuration for laparoscopic esophageal surgery. The
left lobe of the liver was retracted with the 5-mm snake
retractor.

We began by incising the gastrohepatic ligament overlying the
caudate lobe. We carried our dissection to the right crus of
the diaphragm. There was a small hernia and we entered the
dissection plane between the hernia sac and the peritoneum
over the right crus. We entered the mediastinum, taking care
to not injure either pleura. We then carried our dissection
dividing the phrenoesophageal ligament and identified the
medial edge of the left crus of the diaphragm. We then
elevated the esophagus anteriorly and identified the
bifurcation of the right and left crura posterior to the
esophagus. We cleaned the left crus off of the stomach which
was adherent to the diaphragm in this area.

We then turned our attention to the greater curve of the
stomach. We first began by dividing all the short gastric
vessels using the harmonic scalpel. We then carried our
dissection toward the pylorus. We took care to identify and
preserve the right gastroepiploic artery and vein during all
phases of this operation. There were some small collaterals
within the omentum between the right and left gastroepiploic
artery that we also preserved. We carried our dissection
toward the base of the right gastroepiploic artery and vein.
We also divided some adhesions between the posterior surface
of the stomach and the pancreas. Once the stomach was
completely mobilized we then divided the left gastric artery
and vein. This was done using a vascular stapler.

We then turned our attention to the pylorus. We elevated the
pyloric ring using 2 stay sutures. We then injected the
pylorus using 200 units of botulinum toxin.

We then turned our attention to insertion of the laparoscopic
feeding tube. We identified the ligament of Treitz and
selected a portion of small bowel 20 cm distal that we felt
would be appropriate for insertion of the feeding tube. This
portion of the small bowel was tacked up to the anterior
abdominal wall. We then inserted the 7-French needle
jejunostomy catheter using the large needle and wire
assembly. We observed appropriate position of this tube going
distally into the small bowel. We also noted good distension
of the small bowel when air was insufflated into the
jejunostomy catheter, indicating intraluminal positioning of
the feeding tube. The feeding tube was then tacked up to the
abdominal wall using 3 additional sutures. We placed 1 final
suture about 5 cm distal to the insertion site to prevent
torsion of the bowel in this area. The external portion of
the feeding tube was secured to the abdomen using 3-0 nylon
sutures.

Next, we created the gastric tube. We placed bowel graspers
on both the fundus of the stomach as well as the antrum to
make sure that the stomach was straight and not twisted. We
then used the LigaSure device to denude the lesser curve of
the stomach. We preserved the right gastric artery in this
process. Once we approached about 2 cm within the GE
junction, we then used multiple fires of the green Endo [**Female First Name (un) 3224**]
staplers to create a wide gastric tube that was about 6-7 cm
in diameter. Once the tube was created we then placed a
single U stitch between the tube and the specimen to allow
the tube to be brought up into the chest.

We then divided the right crus of the diaphragm using
harmonic scalpel. This was done to prevent obstruction of the
gastric conduit at the
level of the diaphragm. With this done
we then removed the liver retractor. The fascia beneath the
cutdown port in the left upper quadrant was closed using 0
Vicryl. Remaining port sites were closed using 4-0 Vicryl and
Dermabond.

The patient was then rotated to the left lateral decubitus
position. The right chest was prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. Before turning the patient w
