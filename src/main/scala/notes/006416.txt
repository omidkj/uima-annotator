Date of Birth:  [**2119-9-25**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NME


DIAGNOSIS:  Intracerebral bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **], who is a 72 year-old
man with history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and
a recent cerebrovascular stroke of ischemic nature eight
months ago that left him with left arm and leg weakness,  was
found to have distal right hand weakness with an episode of
fall and a facial droop on the right side on [**5-1**].  He was
seen in [**Location (un) 3844**] local hospital and his internal
carotids were reported as 100 percent stenotic and occluded
on the left.  He was, therefore, referred to the vascular
surgery service at our hospital, the [**Hospital1 190**].  Upon admission to the vascular service,
carotid examination revealed left sided stenosis only less
than 69 percent.  A CAT scan and MRI as well as MRV were
performed and a left sided hemorrhagic stroke was documented.
Our service was consulted for the evaluation of his stroke.
He was transferred to our care and was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for overnight observation because the
patient exhibited episodes of respiratory arrest during the
catheterization study.  The patient improved in the Intensive
Care Unit and was transferred to our general neurology floor
for the continuation of care.  During his stay, his motor
examination had revealed right sided weakness, as well as a
right sided facial droop.  These neurologic deficits improved
during his stay and he was evaluated by the physical therapy
to be safe to depart for home.

During his admission, the patient underwent the following
studies:  Chest examination revealed no evidence of pneumonia
on initial examination but mild evidence of congestive heart
failure on the second and near resolution of all the
cardiopulmonary findings on the third scan performed on [**5-8**].
Magnetic resonance imaging of brain, as noted above, revealed
a left external capsule putamen hemorrhage with mild old
lacunar infarct.  His right vertebral artery from the level
of the foramen magnum to the basilar artery had loss of
signal.  Left internal carotid artery had severe narrowing
which was studied by ultrasound to be less than 69 percent
stenotic.  The patient also had a MR venous angiogram on [**5-3**] which revealed no abnormality.

A video swallow study was performed several times, the last
one of which was the day prior to discharge, revealed frank
aspiration and a po diet consistency of nectar thick liquids
with soft solids and crushed pills was recommended by the
swallow team.

LABORATORY DATA:  Mild elevation of white count in the range
of 12 to 13 on the last date of his admission.
Thrombocytopenia which drifted down from 150 on admission to
the range of 126 on the day of discharge.  Normal INR.
Normal urinalysis.  Abnormal high creatinine which ranged
between 1.4 to 1.9, with 1.7 on the day of discharge.
Abnormally high glucose.  Normal cardiac enzymes.  Lipid
panel:  Triglycerides 132; cholesterol 138; HDL 34; LDL 78.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As mentioned, the patient had MICU stay and
was intubated because of episodes of respiratory arrest
during the study of brain with CT.  His stay on the general
floor was uneventful and revealed major improvements.  He
received physical therapy evaluations and treatment on a
daily basis.  He continued on medical treatment with his
blood pressure medications, including Metoprolol 50 mg twice
a day.  He received a full
dose of Levaquin for four days for the findings of lower lobe
opacity in his chest.  He continued on aspirin 81 mg daily
and, due to the presence of hemorrhage inside his brain, we
discontinued his Plavix.  He will, however, continue taking
his Plavix on [**5-17**]. He had an episode of agitation and
confusional spell in the Intensive Care Unit, for which he
received Seroquel 2.5 mg twice a day with good effect.
