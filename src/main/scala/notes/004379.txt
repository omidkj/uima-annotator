asthma flare and was discharged then on a prednisone taper
and was feeling well until about two weeks prior to this
admission when he developed a "lung infection" with cough
productive of green sputum, shortness of breath, and
subjective fever.  He was treated empirically with Biaxin and
increase in prednisone dosage to 60 mg p.o. q.d.   He
improved subsequently and eventually decreased his prednisone
down to 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. (his baseline dose).

Today, upon awakening, he had increased shortness of breath
and wheezing.  He took two nebulizers with some improvement
and went to work.  He had more shortness of breath and came
home.  He took four nebulizers meter-dosed inhalers without
improvement and came to the emergency department.

In the emergency department he was afebrile, vital signs were
stable.  His peak flow was 270.  He was given 125 mg of IV
Solu-Medrol and continuous nebulizers for three hours without
improvement and was admitted to the medical intensive care
