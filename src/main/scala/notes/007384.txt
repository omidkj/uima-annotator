None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 70 yo M w/ h/o CAD, CHF (EF 5-10% from recent ECHO), s/p
rigth right nephrectomy who presents from outside hospital with
sepsis. Pt was originally admitted to [**Hospital1 2436**] on [**2162-11-23**]
with fevers, and [**Location (un) 2452**] colored urine. Initially felt to have a
UTI and treated with levoquin. Also had elevated LFT's but RUQ
US was normal at this point. Continued to spike fevers, and
changed abx to Zosyn out of concern for biliary sepsis. However
Ct chest,abd pelvis unremarkable. He then had worsening acute
renal failure. He was given fluids and then developed
respiratory compromise. Ultimately he required intubation. Blood
pressures continued to drop and required pressors. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was
60 with no response. Ultimately required 3 pressors. Repeat RUQ
US showed GB thickening. A percutaneous cholecystectomy was
placed. Found to have gram negative bacilli in biliary fluid.
Despite aggressive care continued to have worsening renal
failure, required pressors, became anuric, and difficulty to
oxygenate on vent. Therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
CVVH and further intensive care.

Brief Hospital Course:
When patient arrived to floor he was on three pressors at max
dosages. He was required full ventilatory support with FiO2 of
100%. On attempting to transition him from transort meds to our
meds his BP would drop from the low 100's to 60's. During this
time we bolused him 2 L of IVF and continued pressor support.
Initially ABG should acidosis of 7.18 and Bicarb of 15. His
pressors returned to low 100's after fluid boluses but then
would have transient episodes of hypotension. Initially labs
came back with worsening renal failure, elevated trop, hypoca,
hyperphos, leukocytosis. A discussion was held with family given
poor prognosis as patient was in sepsis with multi-organ failure
including heart, lungs, lkidneys, liver. He was anuric. EF at
OSH was 5-10%. Contact[**Name (NI) **] renal about possible CVVH> They
recommended trying lasix, zaroxyln, bicarb gtt. Pt was given
bicarb and calcium and increased his minute ventilation to blow
off CO2. However despite this patient worsened. His BP dropped
into the 50's despite maximizing three pressors. HE then went
into PEA arrest. CPR started. He was given epineprine 1mg times
2 and atropine 1mg times 2 with no response. After 11 minutes of
CPR and coding the patient he was pronounced dead at 2221
(1021pm).
