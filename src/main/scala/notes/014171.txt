imaging: [**2181-3-16**]
Thrombosis within the left internal jugular vein, causing almost
complete
occlusion of the vessel. Loss of respiratory variability on
Doppler imaging of the left subclavian vein is suggestive of
possible thrombus in the left brachiocephalic vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
treatment of her abdominal aortic aneurysm. She tolerated the
surgery well. After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the ICU intubated, on no vasopressive
medications, NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and PCA
for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable. She
was extubated on POD 1 without any complications. She remained
in the ICU until POD2, she was subsequently transferred to the
floor.

Neuro: The patient received PCA with good effect and adequate
pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications, which controlled her pain
well.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Early
ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout
hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Patient remained
afebrile and did not recieve any antibiotics. Her incision
remined clean, dry and intact with minimal to no drainage.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
her stay.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible. She was continued on
aspirin and was started on plavix. She was treated with coumadin
for a few days for the blood clot found in her left internal
jugular vein and possible thrombus in the left brachiocephalic
vein. It was determined that the risks of the treatment
outweighs the benefits and the anticoagulation was stopoped.
Patient is being discharged to home on aspirin and plavix only.



At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
