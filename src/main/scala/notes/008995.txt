Asymptomatic with Aortic Aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2150-12-30**] Endovascular Stenting of Ascending and Aortic Arch w/
Debranching and Re-anastomosis of Right Innominate and Left

History of Present Illness:
85 y/o male s/p thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair in [**2144**]. He was
followed over the years with serial CT scans for known
infrarenal AAA and dilated Asc. Aorta. Recent CT scan revealed
an increasing aneurysm from 6.7 to 7.8 involving the distal
ascending and aortic arch.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- Aortic pathology - aneurysm ascending aorta, infrarenal AAA
(3.9 X 4.5 cm), s/p thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair ([**8-/2144**])
- CRI : recent left ureteral stone with mild hydronephrosis
- Prostate CA s/p radiation
- Diverticulosis
- Amputation R toe: several months ago secondary to infection
- Bilateral Knee Replacement

The patient currently lives alone as his wife is in Rehab. He
will be moving shortly to live closer to his children. He does
not smoke or drink. He is a retired sales representative.

Family History:
Denies any premature CAD

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-1-4**] Chest MRI/MRA: 1. Markedly suboptimal examination due
to patient and technical factors. 2. Markedly attenuated and
thinned right braciocephalic vein. 3. Patent left
brachiocephalic vein. 4. Occluded left internal jugular vein.
[**2151-1-4**] CXR: Endotracheal tube is 7 cm above carina. Left
cordis catheter is in left jugular vein. Tip of NG tube is in
fundus of stomach. Thoracic aortic endograft in situ. There is
cardiomegaly with LV predominance and tortuosity of the thoracic
aorta. There is widening of the superior mediastinum, unchanged
since the prior film of [**2151-1-3**]. There is opacity at the
left base medially obscuring the left hemidiaphragm likely due
to atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe and there is
a probable small left pleural effusion. Surgical clips are
present in the left upper quadrant. No pneumothorax.
[**2150-12-31**] Head CT: There are bilateral hypodensities in the
cerebellar hemispheres and bilaterally in the occipital lobes.
These all to be of similar age, and are most suggestive of
severe posterior circulation ischemia with infarction. The
cerebellar infarcts demonstrate minimal mass effect at this
time, but should be followed for later swelling and posterior
fossa mass effect. There is a mass along the left optic nerve
that appears focally expanded at the orbital apex. There may be
a continuation of this mass in the left cavernous sinus. These
findings are most suggestive of a meningioma, but other lesions,
such as lymphoma, sarcoid, and optic nerve glioma, should be
considered. This will be better evaluated by adding an orbital
study to the brain MR. This is almost certainly a chronic
finding, and need not be evaluated emergently. There is left
posterior parietal and right anterior parietal and temporal
scalp swelling.
[**2150-12-30**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated to 4.2 cm. The aortic arch is
markedly dilated with a maximum diameter of 6.2 cm.. The
descending thoracic aorta had a uniform size and texture
consistent with previous descending thoracoabdominal repair by a
graft. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with
an immobile non-coronary cusp. There is aortic sclerosis with an
aortic valve area of 1.8cm2 and Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Post-Bypass: Preserved biventricular systolic function. Mild MR.
Mild AI and TR. Immedialtely post bypass, there is a mobile
echodensity seen in the ascending aorta and arch giving an
impression of double barrel aorta with flows in both lumens.
This is consistent with retrograde filling of aneurysm sac from
left subclavian artery or an endoleak. The mobile echodensity
represents the arch endograft placed during the surgery. At the
end of the surgery, following additional stent placement, this
filling resolved completely with no residual endoleak
visualized. Ascending and Arch are difficult to visualize
completely, but grafts appear grossly well seated. Descending
Thoracic Aorta is unchanged.
[**2150-12-29**] Abd/Pelvis/LE MRA: 1. Small infrarenal AAA measuring
4.2 x 3.8 cm as described above. No evidence of critical
stenosis in the aorta or iliac arteries. 2. Widely patent right
superficial femoral to posterior tibial artery bypass. Single
vessel runoff to the foot through the right posterior tibial
artery which supplies a widely patent DP through a collateral
and diminuitive plantar arteries. 3. Widely patent flow on the
left to the level of the knee, where arthroplasty susceptibility
obscures the popliteal artery; stenosis can not be excluded at
that level. Two vessel runoff with a PT and peroneal with mild
irregularity; medial plantar is widely patent as is the dorsalis
pedis, which is supplied from a peroneal collateral.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35694**] was admitted a day prior to his surgery for MRA of
his abd/pelvis and routine blood work. On the following day he
was brought to the operating room where he underwent
Endovascular Stenting of Ascending and Aortic Arch w/
Debranching and Re-anastomosis of Right Innominate and Left
Carotid Arteries. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following the surgery he was transferred to the CSRU
for invasive monitoring in stable but serious condition.
Sedation was weaned off by post-op day one but patient did not
wake up and had very poor response to stimuli. Head CT was
immediately performed and Neurology was consulted. CT revealed a
severe posterior circulation infarction.  The consulting
neurologist believed that there was a very low likelyhood of
recovery of any significant neurologic function.  The family
initially chose to continue with aggressive treatment over the
next few weeks.  He has remianed in an unresponsive state, on
hemodialysis, on the ventilator, and on tube feedings.  Due to
the poor prognosis, and lack of improvement in neurologic
function, the family requested that he be ma
