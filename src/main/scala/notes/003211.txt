Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, decreased PO intake

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old male with past history of
asthma/COPD and hypertension transferred from the MICU for
continued treatment of Acute Renal Failure.
.
Per the patient had been in USOH on Saturday evening at a
relatives house having dinner when developed acute onset nausea
and vomiting on Sunday morning. He cites that nausea and
vomiting peaked on Saturday and Sunday with roughly
2-3episodes/day. From Sunday to presentation to the ED developed
progressive lethargy and noted decreased to zero UOP from Sunday
to Thursday. feeling lethargic.
.
Pertinent +/-
Denies fevers, chills, night sweats, sick contacts, recent
travel, EtOH use, abdominal pain or distension, diarrhea,
constipation, chest pain, myalgias.
.
Progressive lethargy and confusion noted by family prompted
presentation to the ED.
 .
In the ED, triggered on presentation for hypotension of 67/31.
Recieved 3L NS with improvment in BP to 110/70's. NG lavage
negative, guiac positive. Labs notable for acute renal failure
with creatinine 7.5 (baseline 1.5) and BUN 123. LFTS WNL, HCT
50.4. Admitted to MICU for hypotension and concern for GI bleed.
Vitals prior to transfer, 96 110/60 17 100% on 2L.
.
MICU course:
Received 3L of IVF; lisinopril and diuretic held. Mental status
cleared with hydration and creatinine improved from 5.6 -> 3.3
(baseline 1.5) with increased UOP. Of note though guaiac +; HCT
stable in house.
.
Prior to transfer to the floor patient with minimal complaint.
.
ROS at time of transfer:
Denies fevers, chills, sweats, anorexia, headache, vision
changes, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitation, abdominal
pain, dysuria, flank pain, myalgias.


Past Medical History:
1. Asthma/COPD/bronchiectasis. - FVC 122% predicted, Lung
volumes >100% predicted, DLCO ~70% predicted
2. Pulmonary nodules.
3. Hypertension.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine 1.5.
5. History of eosinophilia.
6. Vitamin D deficiency.


Social History:
Formerly worked at [**Hospital1 **]  as chef.
Lives with wife; retired
Tobacco: smoked for about 20 years and quit 25 years ago.
EtoH: denies current use
Remote h/o drug abuse


Family History:
No history of GI pathology; no h/o malignancy

Physical Exam:
68 year old male with history of asthma/COPD, hypertension,
chronic kidey insufficiency admitted to the MICU for management
of acute kidney injury and hypotension in setting of 4 days
nausea, vomiting and decreased PO intake..

# Hypotension. Etiology likely hypovolemic in the setting of
nausea, vomiting and limited PO intake in days preceding
hospitalization. Alternative etiolgies entertained on admission
included hypotension secondary to septic shock, secondary to GI
bleed. Regarding potential for infection patient afebrile in
house with WBC wnl and without complaints of localized
infection. GI bleed on presenting differential as pt Guaiac
positive on admission, however patients HCT remained stable
after dilutional drop. Patient received total of 7L of IVF with
improvement in hemodynamics. Nausea resolved quickly after
admission and patient able to take in adequate PO prior to
discharge. Decision made to hold anti-hypertensives to time of
discharge with plan to likely re-implement after post-discharge
appt.
OUTPATIENT:
-- Continue to monitor hemodynamics
-- Re-initiate anti-hypertensives at [**Hospital 1944**] clinic after
both BP and renal function monitored.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure. Baseline creatinine 1.5.
Creatinine on Admission 7.5 -> 5.5 ->3.3 in the setting of IVF.
Etiology likely pre-renal in setting of decreased PO intake,
emesis as function has improved markedly with hydration. Urine
lytes: FeNa: 3.4 consistent with pre-renal -> ATN. Patient with
adequate urine output throughout stay so low clinical suspicion
for obstructive component. At time of discharge, creatinine 1.3;
decision made to hold lisinopril and HCTZ until renal function
monitored and stabilization ensured.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
-- Repeat chemistry 7 as outpatient to monitor renal functino
-- Continue to hold lisinopril and HCTZ until repeat lab values
obtained.

# Persistent nausea, vomiting. Admission differential diagnosis
to Nausea/Vomiting broad with consideration of underlying
Cardiac, Neurologic, Hepatic, Gastric, Renal and Pancreatic
pathology. After work-up surmised that viral gastroenteritis was
likely causative factor for nausea, vomiting. Regarding
alternative diagnosis: LFTs wnl, Lipase 66. Patient without
overt cardiac history (only RF is HTN, HL), EKG without ischemic
changes and though admission Trop elevated it was in setting of
creatinine of 7.5. Cerebellar ischemia can manifest as n/v and
patient does describe gait unsteadiness but less likely than
viral gastroenteritis especially as patients neuro exam is
intact. It was possible that ARF preceded emesis and uremia
incited nausea/emesis however the fact ARF improved so rapidly
with IVF argues against intrinsic or post-renal etiology. During
hospitalization, anti-emetics were used as needed; nausea
resolved and prior to discharge patient tolerated full diet
without nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

#. Guaiac Positive Stool. On admission to the ED, rectal exam
guaiac + with initial concern for UGIB in setting of
hypotension. Subsequent NG Lavage negative. Hct hemoconcentrated
on admission; did downtrend in setting of aggressive IV
hydration which was attributed to dilution. Patient was started
on pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. In house, patient did report one
black bowel movement in house however HCT remained stable and
decision made to work-up question of GI bleed as outpatient with
potential EGD/colonoscopy. Of note patient with last colonscopy
in [**2174**] which demonstrated diverticular disease as well as cecum
and sigmoid polyps s/p polypectomy (cecum path: fragments of
adenoma; sigmoid path: hyperplastic tissue).
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue PPI and enteric coated aspirin
-- Consider need for outpatient work-up: EGD, colonscopy.
.
#. COPD. Patient without respiratory complaints in house. Exam
demonstrated intermittent wheeze and patient treated with
nebulizers as needed. In house continued on home albuterol,
advair, spiriva and singulair. No need for supplemental oxygen
in house.
