History of Present Illness:
A 48-year-old gentleman with a history of AML-M5B status post
matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant with
Cytoxan/TBI conditioning on [**2116-8-25**] presenting with facial
swelling. The patient reports that he first noted the bilateral
facial and neck swelling yesterday morning. However his parents
have noticed mild swelling even on the day prior. Today in the
morning the patient noted worsening swelling also now involving
the L arm. He also noticed problems swallowing and felt that he
could not get his saliva down. He denies any problems breathing
at rest, but noticed shortness of breath with ambulation. On his
way to clinic this morning he felt LH and was trying to sit down
but then LOC and fell on his L side. When he recovered
consciousness he was trying to get up again but then lost
consciusness again falling forward onto his L face. He thinks
that he lost consciousness for several minutes. He also reports
that he has had HA and "sinus congestion" since yesterday, worse
when leaning forward. He reports a cough, worse in the morning
which preceeded the current symptoms. He was seen in clinic
4days prior and was started on Azithromycin.

[**1-20**] and had one placed on the right.

ED COURSE: VS 97.3, 91, BP 115/88, RR 16, O2Sat 99RA. A CXR was
done, that showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. He received
600mg of Tylenol. An EKG was done unchanged from prior. He was
discharged from ED with likely allergic reaction.
.
He was seen again in Heme/[**Hospital **] clinic and was admitted to floor
for concern of [**Hospital 17911**] syndrome. IR was [**Name (NI) 653**], and [**Name2 (NI) **] underwent
CT imaging of head and chest. Bleeding/fracture was ruled out.
[**Name2 (NI) 17911**] clot was seen, and he was started on TPA gtt.
Sent to ICU for TPA/heparin treatment overnight.

Onc Hx:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72663**] is a 48-year-old gentleman who was diagnosed with
AML-M5B in [**4-/2116**] when he was admitted with a white blood count
of 200,000, requiring leukophoresis. He underwent 7 and 3
induction chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission,
although his course was complicated by diffuse pulmonary
hemorrhage. High-dose ARA-C was
administered with recovery of his counts. He also received a
dose of intrathecal ARA-C. He developed hepatic candidiasis
which was treated successfully with oral Diflucan, which delayed
his allogeneic stem cell transplant, but then he underwent
matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant with Cytoxan
and TBI conditioning on [**2116-8-25**]. He did relatively well
post-transplant until [**10/2116**] when he developed left upper lobe
and bilateral opacities with he underwent BLL, which was
nondiagnostic and then proceeded to VATS biopsy with a diagnosis
of acute and organizing pneumonia. He had no other infectious
etiology found and he was begun on a prednisone for presumed
idiopathic BOOP and this has been tapered slowly over time. On
[**2116-12-31**], Mr. [**Known lastname 72663**] developed increasing cough, sore
throat
with yellow sputum. With worsening symptoms he was admitted on
[**2117-1-1**]. CT scan showed new right upper lobe hazy infiltrate
and nasal aspirate was positive for RSV. He was given a dose of
palivizumab and was treated with a course of levofloxacin.
