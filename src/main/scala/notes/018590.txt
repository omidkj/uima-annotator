Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Bleeding from trach site

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
43 yo male with a history of anoxic brain injury living at a
rehab, who is trach and PEG dependent, with recent admission for
tongue laceration, who presents from his rehabilitation facility
with concerns for bleeding from trach. Staff from rehab report
about 400cc bright red blood from trach site over the last 12
hours.

Of note, patient had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 105118**] for a
tongue laceration. During that hospital course he had total
teeth extraction. He also had a high grade MRSA bacteremia and
was started on 4 week course of Vancomycin (last day [**12-19**]). TEE
was negative. He also completed a 7 day course of Cefepime and
Cipro for VAP. LUE US developed thrombus, and patient was
discharged on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] (day 1 = [**11-30**]).

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.5 P 86 BP 114/90 R 16 O2 sat
100.  He recieved midazolam and fentanyl while IP did a bronch.
The bronch was clean without evidence of bleeding from the trach
or lower. The airways were reportedly free of lesions other than
mild, non-bleeding granulation tissue near the tracheostomy
tract. They thought that despite the inflated balloon he may be
aspirating blood from his bleeding gums. A CTA did not reveal a
PE but did show new nodular ground glass opacities in the right
lung and left apex compared to a CT from [**2202-9-2**] abdominal
CT. Because of this he was given Levofloxacin and Cefepime. He
was admitted for further work-up of new ground glass opacity,
and sent to the ICU given his trach.  Prior to transfer vitals
were HR 75-85 BP 110s/80s RR 16 100% on vent.

On the floor, patient is alert, but not interactive.

Studies:

[**2202-12-5**] Chest Xray: Stable position of tracheostomy. Stable
cardiomegaly.

[**2202-12-5**] CTA Chest:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome,
although the evaluation of subsegmental pulmonary arteries is
technically limited.
2. Mild enlargement of the main pulmonary artery suggests
underlying
pulmonary hypertension.
3. There are diffuse nodular and ground-glass densities
throughout the right lung and at the left apex. These appear new
compared to [**2202-9-20**], when they were not seen on lung
bases on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis.  There is associated
bronchial wall thickening and hilar adenopathy. Overall, this is
most conssitent with a infectious bronchopneumonia. Given the
clinical history, alvealar hemorrhage should also be considered.
Close imaging follow-up is recommended with radiography as well
as chest CT follow-up, particularly given lymphadenopathy,
within three months, if clinically indicated.
4. Trace pericardial effusion.
5. Small-to-moderate ascites.

[**2202-12-6**] Left upper extremity ultrasound:
No evidence of left upper extremity DVT. Mildly abnormal
subclavian venous waveform.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 year old male with anoxic brain injury, s/p PEG & trach,
after a PEA arrest in [**9-/2202**] (pt was undergoing VT ablation)
who was readmitted with bleeding from trach site.

#. Bleeding: This was his second admission for bleeding from his
trach site.  The first admisison, it was felt that he was
gnawing at his tongue with his teeth and his teeth were
subsequently pulled.  This time, it appeared his bleeding was
coming from his gums in the areas where his teeth had been
recently pulled.  His Lovenox was stopped and he was started on
clonazepam 0.25mg po TID to prevent gnawing behaviors.  His
hematocrit remained stable and he continued to have minimal
low-grade bleeding from his gums.

#. Aspiration pneumonitis: On admission he had ground glass
opacities seen on CT scan that were felt to represent likely
aspiration of blood.  He had a bronchoscopy that was not notable
for thick secretions or alveolar hemorrhage.  He was given a
dose of Levofloxacin and cefepime in the ED but antibiotics were
stopped on admission due to low clinical suspicion for pneumonia
(with the exception of Vancomycin for which he is completing a
course for prior bacteremia).  He did not have any fevers,
cough, or new oxygen requirement.

#. MRSA Bacteremia: At his last hospitalization he had
high-grade MRSA bacteremia with 6/6 bottles positive on [**11-20**].
He continued a 4-week course of Vancomycin to end on [**2202-12-19**].

#. L UE Thrombus: He had a previous LUE thrombus of brachial
vein.  Repeat ultrasound on this admission showed no evidence of
thrombus.  Due to his bleeding, his Lovenox was discontinued.
His PICC line should be removed when he finishes his course of
Vancomycin on [**2202-12-19**].

#. S/p anoxic brain injury: He continues to be trach and PEG
dependent. He appearesd at his baseline mental status.  His tube
feeds were restarted.

#. Diabetes: He was continued on an insulin sliding scale.

#. Hypertension: His antihypertensives were held due to low
blood pressure and bleeding on admission.  These were restarted
at lower doses at discharge (lisinopril, carvedilol), and his
Lasix was restarted at full dose.  His lisinopril can be
titrated up to 10mg daily and his carvedilol can be titrated up
to 25mg po bid if needed for hypertension.

#. Cardiovascular disease: His aspirin was initially held but
was restarted at discharge at a lower dose.  He was continued on
atorvastatin.

#. Code Status: He was full code during this hospitalization.
Goals of care discussions were continued with the family during
this admission and should be continued after discharge.

Medications on Admission:
1. Bisacodyl 10 mg po daily PRN constipation
