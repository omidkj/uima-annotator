with increased SOB and worsening cough. She reports 3 days of
increasing cough and sputum production. CXR at her nursing home
2 days ago was consistent with PNA and oral antiobiotics were

7.43/47/74.
Patient received albuterol/ipratropium nebs, levofloxacin 750mg
IV, Methylprednisolone 125mg IV, 1gm ceftriaxone, 1gm
vancomycin. Lactate 1.7. Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for

respiratory status improved. She also underwent regularly
scheduled HD on the day of transfer during which 2 kg of fluid
was removed.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**4-16**].
.
HISTORY: End-stage renal disease and CHF with shortness of
breath.
.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-15**]:
.
Mild interstitial edema has cleared from the left lung, persists
at the right base. Lateral view shows small right pleural
effusion collected posteriorly.  Moderate cardiomegaly
unchanged. No pneumothorax. Dialysis catheter ends in the SVC.
<br>

CXR [**4-17**]:

REASON FOR EXAM: CHF and tachypnea.
.
Comparison is made with prior studies [**4-15**] and 11.
.
Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild interstitial pulmonary
edema is
unchanged, asymmetric and greater on the right side.
Small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions are increased on the right side.
Retrocardiac
opacity is consistent with atelectasis. Right supraclavicular
catheter is in place. Sternal wires are aligned. The patient is
status post MVR.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 y/o f c/ CHF, CAD, ESRD on HD presenting from nursing facilty
with SOB and worsening cough x5 days admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
concern for respiratory distress.  Hospital Course as below:
<br>

#. Respiratory Distress - sx improving as of am of [**4-16**], CXR
demonstrating retrocardiac opacity consistent with PNA and b/l
pleural effusions, with repeat CXR [**4-16**] showing improvement but
persistant R base findings - cont tx for PNA. Etiology likely
multifactorial in setting of CHF, ESRD on HD and PNA.  Improved
after starting on Abx and particularly especially w/ regularly
scheduled HD with improved volume status.  Overall, CXR
suggestive more of R-sided PNA after fluid taken out - plan to
cont abx.  Noted events with increased SOB sx overnight [**4-16**] -
overall pt 1.6L positive for [**4-16**] - mildly increased fluid on
exam/CXR - with PNA process pt with lower threshold for fluid as
prior - in addition with noted upper resp secretions - declined
deep suctioning, but improved with mucolytics agents and with
min secretions as of [**4-18**].  Pt recieved HD [**4-18**] - doing well
following - plan to complete 8 day course of antiobiotic
(finishing [**4-22**]) - changed to po cefopodixime today, cont IV
vanc post HD).
- HD as below, (noted pt can only make scant urine)
- decreased fluid intake [**4-17**] - pt doing better
- change nebs to q6h PRN
- cont mucomyst nebs and guaifensin to [**Month/Year (2) **] w/ secretions for
next 2 days - can then change to just PRN
- origninally treated for for healthcare associated PNA,
especially as known MRSA, was treated with broad spectrum abx
with report failed to fluroquinolone prior - it was confirmed
that the abx was levoquin (started [**4-11**]) - based on this  d/c
levoquin as of [**4-16**]
- unable to obtain adequate sputum cx - tx as above
