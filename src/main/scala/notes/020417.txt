Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy and Peg tube placement- [**10-22**]

History of Present Illness:
77 y/o male with CHF, COPD, OSA presented to the pulmonary
clinic today for a second opinion, was found to be markedly
hypoxemic and in respiratory distress so was sent to the ED,
where he was felt to have volume overload (BNP > 5000), a
pneumonia, and a COPD exacerbation.  There, he was given
steroid, nebs, furosemide, and levofloxacin, was placed on bipap
and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name **].  He apparently was satting quite well on
bipap and was never hemodynamically unstable.

Per the pulmonary clinic's OMR note, he has a baseline O2
requirement of 5 liters (and even then generally sats in the low
90's, high 80's).  His baseline pco2 is 50's-60's.  His PFT's in
pulmonary clinic were consistent with severe obstructing and
possibly some air-trapping (versus low lung volumes, no TLC
available) -- FVC 40%, FEV1 27%, fev1/fvc 68%.
The patient says he's had gradually increasing dyspnea over the
last year, mainly with exertion, to the point where now walking
from the bedroom to bathroom exhausts him.  Over the past month,
he's had worsening orthopnea and lower extremity edema, and for
the past two weeks he's had a productive cough and worsening
shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain, fevers/chills,
viral symptoms, n/v/d/c.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2181-10-1**] 5:16 PM:
PORTABLE CHEST: The cardiac contour is not fully visualized but
appears slightly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
There is pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse increase in
interstitial markings. There is a moderate left pleural effusion
and small right pleural effusion. Bilaterallower lobe
consolidations are identified. Surrounding osseous and soft
tissues structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF with moderate left pleural effusion and
a small right pleural effusion. Bibasilar more confluent
pulmonary opacities may be secondary to asymmetric edema or
atelectasis; however, an underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2181-10-2**] 4:08 AM:
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color, and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of both common femoral, both superficial
femoral, and both popliteal veins were performed. Normal
compressibility, color flow, augmentation, and waveforms are
demonstrated in all these veins. No intraluminal thrombus is
noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either
lower extremity.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2181-10-3**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF
60-70%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow  pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly  thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT PORT  [**2181-10-11**] 2:30 PM:
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
ultrasound of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary,
brachial, basilic, and cephalic vein was performed. There is
echogenic thrombus within the left internal jugular vein, which
does not fill the entire lumen. There is peripheral flow within
the internal jugular vein. The subclavian, axillary, brachial,
basilic, and cephalic veins have normal compression, waveforms,
and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus in the left internal jugular
vein.


















Brief Hospital Course:
#Fever - spiked to 100 on [**10-30**]. Pan-cultures sent. Most likely
source is pulmonary, given that he is on a vent chronically and
has positive sputum cultures from [**10-30**] (4+ GPC by gram stain,
cultures pending) and [**10-25**] (2+ GNR by gram stain, cultures
pending). Urine culture from [**10-30**] shows >100,000 GNR,
identification pending. Blood cultures from [**10-30**] are no growth
to date. Given his increased secretions and need for frequent
suctioning, his infection source is most likely pulmonary.
- He is covered broadly on Ceftaz and Vanc which should be
continued for at least 10 days (he is currently on day 2).
- His subclavian line and arterial line were reomved on [**10-30**],
with cultures pending from SCL catheter tip.
- Blood cultures 11/29 pending
- Culture from SCL tip [**10-30**] pending
- Urine culture [**10-30**] identification of GNR pending
- Sputum cultures 11/29 and [**10-25**] identification pending
**cultures should be followed up to further tailor antibiotic
therapy -> currently is covered very broadly on Ceftazidime and
Vancomycin
.
#Respiratory distress -- Initially on bipap, however, worsened
and was intubated [**10-7**]. Likely multifactorial due to copd, chf
and MRSA pneumonia. Unable to wean the vent due to volume
overload, autopeep, hypotension, decreased mental status, high
RsBI.
- Tracheostomy [**10-22**] with PEG placement [**10-22**]
- has intermittent air leak from the trach with certain
positions secondary to size of his trachea and shape of trachea
(saber-shaped) -> thoracis evaluated this and recommend
continuing with present tracheostomy as repsiratory status is
stable and air leak is intermittent and positional
- cuff pressures should be measured and if elevated in the high
20's or even more, should re-evaluate for possible change of
trach
- continues on AC vent settings, can start weaning again to PS
.
#Hypotension -- Became hypotensive immediately after intubated
and sedated.  Initially on dopamine for BP in 70s. On [**10-8**] went
into rapid afib in 140s; switched to levophed. On [**10-10**] switched
to neo given
