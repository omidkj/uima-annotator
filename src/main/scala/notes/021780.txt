Pertinent Results:
On admission, pt was hemoconcentrated with CBC showing WBC 13.6
(NEUTS-77* BANDS-14* LYMPHS-5* MONOS-3 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0
METAS-1* MYELOS-0), Hct 35.9, and plt 214.
UA was negative with pH 7.0 and sp [**Last Name (un) **] 1.018
Coags revealed PT-13.2 PTT-25.9 INR(PT)-1.1. Chem 7 was Na 137,
K 4.4, Cl 101, HCO3 24,BUN 40*, Creat 1.1, and Glucose 134*,
calcium 9.7 phosphate 0.7*, and Mg 1.7.
Cardiac enzymes were negative. CRP was 1.07*, cortisol was
38.9*.
Lipase was 12.
LFTS showed ALT 34 AST 37 ALK PHOS 105 AMYLASE 145* TOT BILI 1.4
and LACTATE-4.4*

CXR on [**8-16**] compared to [**8-15**] showed worsening right-sided
infiltrate; LLL atelectasis vs. early infiltrate; Upper zone
redistribution, without other CHF; and
Right IJ central line, tip well seen and overlying the right
atrium.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis: Likely caused by RLL PNA rather than line infection
as line was only placed 2 days prior to admission. Was sent to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was initially placed on pressors and covered
per sepsis protocol on [**8-15**] with levo/vanc/gent. Placed on only
Levo IV as of [**8-17**]. On [**8-16**], was taken off pressors with stable
bps until discharge. Transferred to the floor on [**8-17**]. Wbc
continued to trend downwards until 5.6 on discharge and remained
afebrile on the floor. Did not require fluid boluses on the
floor. Will cont with Levofloxacin for tx of CAP. PICC line
d/ced in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but as catheter tip cx was negative and blood
cx remained negative x 72 hours, it was replaced on [**8-19**].

2. Hypotension.  Likely secondary to sepsis.  No evidence of
ischemia on ECG or enzymes.  Serum cortisol wnl so adrenal
insufficiency unlikely.  Since transfer to the floor, remained
hemodynamically stable and did not require any fluid boluses.

3. ?CHF: Received over 4L in IVF and c/o increased LE edema and
also mild LUE edema.  Recent echo [**6-29**] with EF 70-80%,
hyperdynamic systolic fxn, likely diastolic dysfunction.  Fluid
status was monitored closely with strict I+Os and daily weights.

4. F/E/N.  Complex nutritional picture and has had many PICC
infections. At home, TPN dependent with recent advance to broth
and baby food.  After PICC d/ced on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], received
TPN via IJ line. PICC replaced on [**8-19**] for TPN on discharge.
Patient manages her TPN infusions by herself at home and was
thus discharged with home TPN.

5. Hypothyroidism.  Continued outpt dose of levothyroxine 125 mg
po qd. Had problems tolerating [**Name2 (NI) **] dose on last admission with
increased emesis and was on IV as an outpatient. Discharged on
po levothyroxine.

6. Anemia: Unclear etiology, but could possibly be dilutional,
though Hct at baseline appears to be 27-30 (came in very
hemoconcentrated at 38).  Hemolysis labs were normal. Most
likely the result of bone marrow suppression due to sepsis. Had
Fe, B12, and Folate studies performed on [**2194-7-17**] with nl B12 and
Folate. Appeared to be anemia of chronic disease with low nl
iron, lo TIBC, hi ferritin, and low transferrin. Was guiac
negative. PCP aware and will follow up as an outpatient.

7. Thrombocytopenia - Platelets decreased from over 200 on
admission (though hemoconcentrated) to around 125 throughout
course. HIT Abs were sent and heparin was initally held in TPN
bag. DIC panel was neg and she did not have any problems with
bleeding. On discharge, plt increased to 163 and was stable, and
decrease in plts was not considered to be secondary to heparin.
Since plt count on discharge was stable and improved, PCP was
made aware of thrombocytopenia and will follow up HIT Ab as well
as any further w/u as an outpatient.

8. PPx: On H2 blocker initially and changed to Protonix [**8-18**] for
worry of thrombocytopenia.

9. Code Status.  Full.
