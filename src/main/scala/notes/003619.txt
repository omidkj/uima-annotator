History of Present Illness:
55 y/o man with PMH significant for depression, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and HTN admitted through the ED with mental status
changes and fever. Per report, pt was in his normal state of
health this morning when he went out to buy groceries. He had a
normal conversation with his wife on his cell phone at
approximately 1:00 PM. Then, at around 3:00 PM, his wife noted
him to be confused and diaphoretic. He was apparently talking
giberish. EMS was called and his VS were 162/90  130  16  98%.
Pt was given narcan with no improvement in his mental status and
he was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care. In the ED, the
pt's VS were 102.3 ---> 103.8  134  153/96  25  97% 2L NC. He
had a head CT which did not show any acute process. Pt had a LP.
His urine tox screen was positive for opiates. In the ED, the pt
received ceftriaxone 2 gm IV x1, flagyl 500 mg IV x1, acyclovir
800 mg IV x1, ampicillin 2 gm IV x1, and vancomycin 1 gm IV x1.
He also received multiple doses of ativan and valium.
.
In further discussion, pt reports that he has been SOB recently
but is unable to tell me how long. Per report he has had
increased wheezing and SOB over the past few weeks and received
a Z pack without any improvement in his symptoms. Pt reports
that he had a headache this morning. He is unable to give any
further ROS.


Past Medical History:

baseline over the last two months.
2. COPD

Gen- Alert to person and year. Talking very quickly and
antimatedly. NAD.
HEENT- NC AT. PERRL. EOMI. Anicteric sclera. Mildly dry mucous
membranes. No lesions in the oropharynx.
Cardiac- RRR. S1 S2. No m,r,g.
Pulm- Diffuse end expiratory wheezing bilaterally. No rales or
rhonchi.
Abdomen- Obese. Soft. NT. ND. Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities- Warm. No c/c/e. 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Neuro- Alert to person and year. No oriented to place. Talking
very quickly with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] attention. Able to spell

immediately but not in five minutes. CN II-XII intact. [**3-31**]
strength in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Symmetric
DTRs bilaterally. [**Name2 (NI) **] within normal limits.


Pertinent Results:
ECG- Sinus tach at 130 beats per minute. No ST-T wave changes.
.
CXR- Left costophrenic angle is partially excluded from the
radiograph. Heart size and mediastinal contours appear within
normal limits. Prominence of the upper zone pulmonary
vasculature may relate to supine positioning. Within the left
lung base, there is a focal area of patchy opacity that could
represent atelectasis versus early consolidation. A rounded
opacity seen at the right lung base laterally could represent a
nipple shadow. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax are
identified. Osseous structures appear within normal limits.
.
CT head- Study is limited by patient motion. No gross
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. There is no shift of
midline structures. Differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter
appears preserved. no hydrocephalus is demonstrated and sulci
are within normal limits. Sulci and basal cisterns appear
unremarkable. Minimal mucosal thickening is demonstrated within
both ethmoid sinuses. Small amount of mucosal thickening is also
seen within the right maxillary sinus. Pt is s/p left anterior
maxillary wall surgery. Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o man with PMH significant for depression, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and HTN admitted through the ED with mental status
changes and fever.
.
1. Delirium: It is unclear why he would be having this. Included
in the differential diagnosis are infection, overdose, serotonin
syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and hyperthyroidism.
MRI did not show any reason for acute change in MS: no sign of
HSV encephalitis; did show Tiny nonspecific elevated FLAIR
signal intensity foci in the cerebral white matter and mid-
pons.  TSH was within normal limits. It is unlikely the pt's PNA
alone would have caused his delirium as he is relatively young
and healthy and the PNA does not seem abnormally severe. Most
likely ethanol or withdrawal were the cause of his delirium. He
denied drinking but was taking benzodiazepines and opioids that
he has obtained on the street. He was given 110 mg of diazepam
before significant decrease in his agitation making
benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal the likely etiology. Urine
tox screen was negative for amphetamines. Speaking with his
wife, she had found two bottles of meds in his room at home but
was not sure what they were as they had been placed in spare
bottles. Pills were found to be ibuprofen 600mg, tramadol, and
xanax 1mg.
The patient's med list was obtained from his PCP's office on
[**10-10**]. no psychotropic medications are prescribed. the [**Doctor First Name **]
pharmacy also had no record of psychotropic medications being
filled.  His PCP confirmed [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/o substance abuse but the patient
reported being clean at last visit on [**10-5**].  Patient was treated
with diazepam for CIWA>10. His agitation, hypertension and fever
resolved by the morning after admission. He was alert and
oriented but was still with pressured speech. Despite our
recommendations he left the hospital against medical advice.

2. [**Name (NI) **] Pt found to have an infiltrate on CXR in addition to
being febrile and having an elevated WBC count. Also concern for
concurrent COPD exacerbation.  He was treated with steroids,
azithromycin and oxygen to maintain sats around 93 %. Ct scan
was planned to further characterize this process. However, the
patient left before this study could be completed. He was
strongly advised to follow up with his PCP to follow up his
chest x-ray abnormality.
.
3. HTN- [**Doctor First Name **] pharmacy was contact[**Name (NI) **] and it was found that he
was taking lisinopril, carvedilol, Lipitor and niacin. These
medications were continued during his hospital stay.
.
4. Type 2 [**Name (NI) 1568**] Pt takes insulin at home but his wife is unaware
of the dose. Metformin and Humulin were held during admission.
Fingersticks were well controlled with RISS.
