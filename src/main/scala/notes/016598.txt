Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 101860**] operative course was converted from laparoscopic
to open due to body habitus and intra-abdominal anatomy.
Operative course was otherwise uncomplicated. He was monitored
in the PACU, and transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring
due to medical co-morbidities. ICU issues included low blood
pressure and marginal urine output. Bolused with IV albumin. IV
fluid marginalized due to h/o diastolic CHF. SBP's and urine
output stabilized. Labwork, included creatinine stable.
Transferred to Stone 5 for post-op care.
.
Started on sips on POD [**1-17**]. Pain well controlled with PCA. Foley
placed. Triggered for low SBP to 70's. Bolused with albumin x 1.
Urine output decreased to 5cc/hr, bloody. Bolused w/ albumin. IV
fluid continued at reduced rate. Renal consulted-ACE-I, [**Last Name (un) **],&
nifedipine held; Goal SBP >100 at all times. Daily creatinines
checked. Lasix dose gradually increased to home dose as CR's
returned to baseline. Urine output improved. SBP's returned to
baseline over nect 24-38 hours. Home medications resumed. Foley
removed, able to urinated adequate amounts.
.
Abdominal incision, midline, intact with staples. Distal erythem
progressed beyond markings. IV Kefzol started. Erythema
improved. No exudate/drainage. Diet advanced at bowel function
resumed. Reported flatus and eventual bowel movement prior to
discharge. Physical Therapy consulted due to obesity and
difficulty moving independently with abdominal incision. PT
cleared patient for discharge home with 24 hour supervision, use
of rolling walker at home until stonger/more stable, use of
bedside commode, & continue with home Physical Therapy.
.
Patient discharged home with services, PO Keflex for a few more
day for incisional erythema. Advised to follow-up with
Nephrologist-Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 11916**] within 1 week for creatinine check,
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] in 1 week for staple removal.
