SOB

History of Present Illness:
60 year-old female with fibromyalgia, OA, and schizophrenia but
no known prior cardiac history presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**12-31**] with
dyspnea and weakness and was found to be both grossly overloaded
and in shock. Apparently, her hx dates back to [**Month (only) 359**], when she
first noted a fairly rapid decrement in her normal exercise
function. Prior to [**9-/2154**], she felt her exercise capacity was
fairly limitless; however, beginning in [**Month (only) **], she became
increasingly dyspneic with decreasingly small amounts of
exertion. Around the same time she developed lower extremity
edema and up to four-pillow orthopnea, whereas she'd previously
had none. The week prior to admission, she felt her sx began to
worsen. On the day of admission, she fell out of bed and was far
too weak to right herself, so she called EMS who found her on
the floor and appearing extraordinarily dyspneic and tachypneic.

.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was found to have a temp of 99.8, bp in the
90's, and was hypoxemic (to unclear value, but required a 100%
NRB-mask to raise her o2 sat to 100%). Her initial labs included
a WBC of 19, lactate of 6.9, BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 65367**], an ABG of 7.36/30/36,
and a cVo2 of 40%. She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for a RLL infiltrate. She was given 3.5L of NS for her
hypotension, started on dobutamine, and sent to the ICU. In the
ICU she was kept on a NRB, and the dobutamine was changed to
norepi. She became anuric for 7-8 hours, and her lactate climbed
to 7 and Cr from 1.1 to 1.4. Given the confusing picture, a
PA-catheter was placed, and the numbers demonstrated cardiogenic
shock, with PAD 20-30's, PCWP in the 20's, and SVR around 2500;
as such, she was switched to dobutamine and nitroprusside, with
good urine response. Her creatinine also began to decline.

BRIEF HISTORY:   60 year old woman with cardiogenic shock of
uncertain
etiology.
.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Cardiogenic shock
.
PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation: was initiated with an
introducer
sheath using a Cardiac Assist 9 French 30cc wire guided
catheter,
inserted via the left femoral artery.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:     Three vessel coronary artery disease.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. There is 40% ostial stenosis involving the left main coronary
artery.
3. The left anterior descending is diffusely diseased with
serial 50%
stenoses and a 90% stenosis at a large bifurcating second
diagonal.  The
first diagonal branch has an 80% origin stenosis and the second
diagonal
has a 60% origin stenosis.
4. The AV groove circumflex is totally occluded in the mid
vessel with a
large thrombus burden.  A large obtuse marginal branch
reconstitutes via
left to left collaterals.
5. There is a high takeoff of the right coronary artery with a
50%
ostial stenosis and diffuse 60-80% stenosis and 70% stenosis of
the
origin of the posterolateral branch.
