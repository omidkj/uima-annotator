Chief Complaint:
Exertional chest pressure and dyspnea x 3-4 months

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-11-12**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to
LAD, vein graft to OM, vein graft to RCA)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old man with a history of hypertension,
hyperlidemia who has complained of exertional chest pressure and
dyspnea for the last 3-4 months. A stress test done [**2125-11-5**] was
abnormal (results not available) and underwent elective cardiac
catheterization [**2125-11-8**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1474**] Hospital. This
was notable for a 40% left main lesion and a 95-99% stenosis in
the distal right coronary artery. Based upon the above results,
he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
treatment.

Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia

works as a part time limo driver.

[**2125-11-8**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated an 85% lesion in
the
left main coronary artery.  The left main and left circumflex
demonstrated no significant atherosclerotic flow limiting
lesions.  The
right coronary artery was not engaged.  Evaluation of the
cardiac
catheterization films from outside laboratory demonstrated a 95%
distal
RCA lesion.
2.  Assessment of the left main lesion with a Radi Pressure wire

demonstrated an FFR of 0.71 at maximal hyperemia demonstrating a

significant flow limiting lesion.
3.  LV ventriculography was deferred.
4.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated central
pressure
(150/77 mm Hg).
[**2125-11-9**] Carotid Ultrasound:
1)There was no stenosis within bilateral internal carotid
arteries.
[**2125-11-9**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal
(LVEF 60%); the posterior wall may be hypokinetic but all other
walls contract normally. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed an 85% distal left main lesion along with
significant stenosis in the right coronary artery. Based upon
the above, cardiac surgery was consulted and further
preoperative evaluation was performed - please see result
section. He awaited Plavix washout and remained stable on
medical therapy. On [**11-12**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed three
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. For surgical details,
please see separate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He maintained stable hemodynamics
and weaned from inotropic support without difficulty. On
postoperative day two, he transferred to the SDU. Chest tubes
and pacing wires were removed without complication. He tolerated
beta blockade and remained in a normal sinus rhythm. Over
several days, medical therapy was optmized and he continued to
make clinical improvements with diuresis. He was medically
cleared for discharge to home with VNA on postoperative day #5.
Pt. to make all followup appts. as per discharge instructions.
