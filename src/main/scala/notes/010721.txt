History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 85 y/o F with h/o CVA, CRI, asthma p/w respiratory
failure.  Pt seen by her son on am of admission coughing after
taking pills, increased coughing "fit" after breakfast.  Pt
noted to be "wheezy" this am and given alb/ipratropium neb.

ED.  ROS (-) per family and caretaker.  [**Name (NI) **] CP, no f/c, no n/v/d.

Studies:

CXR [**6-16**]:
A right PICC line remains in satisfactory position within the
superior vena cava. The heart is mildly enlarged but stable.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits for technique.
There is improving aeration at both lung bases with residual
patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region as well as
residual small pleural effusions, left greater than right.

IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary edema.

2) Improving aeration at the lung bases with residual
atelectasis predominantly at the left lung base.

[**6-9**] Echo:
IMPRESSION:Preserved global biventricular systolic function. At
least mild
mitral regurgitation.

Based on [**2160**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.

[**6-3**] CT HEAD:
FINDINGS: There is no intraparenchymal or extra-axial
hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures,
mass effect or hydrocephalus. There are large chronic-appearing
infarcts involving the left frontal lobe and the left
temporoparietal regions with an ACA and MCA distribution
respectively. There is also extensive bilateral subcortical and
periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with
chronic small vascular ischemic change. There is mild prominence
of the ventricles and sulci consistent with age related
involutional change. The visualized paranasal sinuses and
osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Multiple large chronic-appearing infarcts involving the left
frontal and left temporoparietal regions.
3. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic change and age
involutional change.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respiratory failure ?????? etiology presumed to be asthma
exacerbation complicated by [**Month/Day/Year 8974**] pneumonia. Pt was intubated in
ED, and given Levaquin and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration
pneumonia. On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Vancomycin was added to pt's
abx regimen. Pt remained on mechanical ventilation, with good
ventilation and oxygenation, but unable to extubate [**12-21**] copious
secretions. A bronchoscopy was performed which show
