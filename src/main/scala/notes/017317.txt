Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**]
Chief Complaint:
RLE weakness, acuter renal failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left cheek metal shrapnel removed [**2130-3-29**].
Bronchoscopy [**2130-3-31**] (attempted).

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 85113**] is a 57 yo man with recent diagnosis of metastatic
HCC, HepC cirrhosis, and DMII, bipolar d/o and  depression,
presented to the ED yesterday with rt lower extremity weakness
x5 days. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt had a head ct w/o contrast which showed
left frontal vasogenic edema concerning for a mass , however, no
mass seen. Pt was started on IV decadron. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was
hypotensive with systolic BP in 80's ,labs notable for acute
renal failure with a metabolic acidosis. Pt was transfered to
teh MICU due to hypotension. In the micu pt continued to receive
IVF with stabilization of BP not requiring pressors and
improvement of acute renal failure.
On the floor, pt reports decreased appetite over teh apst [**4-7**]
days, + nausea but no emesis, he continues to suffer from rt
lower extremity weakness which is limiting his gait.He does
report worsening of chronic lower back pain and functional
incontinence as gait is limited. Additionally, he has abdominal
pain related to HCC.He denies fevers, chills, new
headache,speech changes, vision changes, chest pain, sob,
cough,melena, hematochezia, dysuria.All other ten point ROS is
negative.

[**2130-3-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, but no acute
cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**2130-3-24**] Head CT w/o contrast: FINDINGS: In the high left frontal
lobe, there is a focal area of vasogenic edema (Se2:Im 21-26). A
possible 1 cm slightly hyperdense lesion is seen at the left
frontal vertex (Se2;27), but this is difficult to discern. There
is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation is preserved. Ventricles and sulci appear normal
in size and configuration with possibly mild sulcal effacement
at the left vertex. The paranasal sinuses are clear and the
mastoid air cells are also clear.
IMPRESSION: High left frontal vasogenic edema, highly worrisome
for
metastatic disease given history vs primary neoplasm. 1 cm
rounded hyperdense focus at the left frontal vertex could
represent an underlying lesion, although this is difficult to
discern. MR is recommended for further evaluation.
.
[**2130-3-24**] CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal evaluation of the liver due to lack of intravenous
contrast, and assessment for interval change of known liver
mass(es) is difficult. Progression of disease with interval
increase in size of porta hepatis nodal masses and mediastinal
nodal masses/lymphadenopathy; subtle hyperdensity of the hepatic
masses is noted and internal hemorrhage is not excluded.
2. Porta hepatis masses may be causing mass effect on the portal
vein and possibly distal common bile duct. Distended gallbladder
and dilated common bile duct.
3. Pancreatic calcifications, one of which appears to be in the
duct with improved upstream pancreatic duct dilatation compared
to prior study.
4. Non-obstructing 4-mm left renal stone.
.
[**2130-3-25**]: CT T/L SPINE W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: Limited
non-contrast-enhanced CT of the thoracic and lumbar spine
without definite findings to explain the patient's symptoms.
Degenerative change with grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1, and
disk bulges at multiple levels.
.
[**2130-3-28**] CT SINUS/FACE: IMPRESSION:
1. Foreign body, likely metallic, anterior to the left
infraorbital rim.
2. Periapical lucency is identified at the left lateral incisor
[**Doctor First Name **] #
23(image 14, series 8).
3. A contour irregularity of the left lamina papyracea could be
congenital in etiology or may represent old trauma.
.
[**2130-3-30**] CT CHEST: IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread malignancy, primarily nodal involving the thoracic
inlet and mediastinum, particularly the subcarinal station, and
the celiac region in the abdomen.
2. No definite lung metastases, but it is difficult to separate
inflammatory centrilobular bronchiolar nodulation from early
metastases.
3. Cirrhosis, large liver mass.
.
[**2130-3-30**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: The study is significantly
limited due to motion artifact. There is a 1.6-cm enhancing mass
with likely central necrosis within the posterior left frontal
lobe at the vertex in the region of the precentral gyrus with
extensive surrounding white matter edema involving the frontal
and parietal lobes. No other definite lesions are identified
although given significant motion artifact, small enhancing
lesions will be missed. Differential includes metastatic disease
as well as primary brain malignancy.
