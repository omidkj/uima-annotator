Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 69390**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2118-5-28**] - thrombectomy and bare metal
stent placement to proximal LAD


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6817**] is an 85 y/o male with a history of CAD s/p PCI to prox
LAD([**2111**]), Sick Sinus Syndrome s/p PPM who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] the night of [**2118-5-27**] with chest pain.
Patient states that he was having substernal chest pain most of
the night with associated diaphoresis.  He denies radiation to
jaw or extremities, no nasuea/vomiting, no numbness/tingling,
lightheadedness or dizziness.  EKG at OSH were remarkable for
paced rhythm with LV bundle branch block.  He was admitted to
OSH for monitoring, given aspirin, and his troponins trended
0.04-->5.59-->21.01, he was transferred here for
catheterization.

In the ED vitals were 98.4, 60, 185/88, 16, 99% 2L NC.  Labs
were significant for troponin here was 4.08 and BUN/Cr: 37/1.9,
H/H: 9.5/28.8.  For BP control, he was started on a nitro drip
at 1mcg/kg/min.  His BP ranged from 160's-180's so he received
hydral 5mg IV, and metoprolol 5mg IV with minimal effect.  He
was given nitro paste and morphine for Chest pain.  Heparin drip
was started, cardiology was consulted and he was taken
emergently to the cath lab.

In the cath lab for his NSTEMI he was underwent angiography and
was found to have 3 vessel disease with a culprit lesion in the
LAD. Thrombectomy was performed and a bare metal stent was
placed in the proximal LAD. He was started on Eptifibatide for
18 hours, ASA and Plavix. Transferred to the CCU CP free and
stable, on nitro drip for pressures, will monitor overnight

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, cough, hemoptysis. He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors.
.
Per chart, prior history of TIA and retinal vein occlusion. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, and absence
of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6817**] is an 85 y/o male with a history of CAD s/p PCI ([**2111**]),
SSS s/p PPM who presented an OSH, transferred here for NSTEMI,
taken to cath lab and had a stent placed to prox [**Hospital 54969**] hospital
course complicated by hematemesis and community acquired
pneumonia.

Acute issues:

# CORONARIES: Patient is s/p drug-eluting stent placement to
proximal LAD with small dissection occuring during procedure.
Post cath he was chest pain free and on Eptifibatide 1
mcg/kg/min for 18 hours.  He was started on Plavix 75mg po
daily. Continued on home aspirin, metoprolol, and nifedipine.
His ACE inhibitor was not resumed given his history of
hyperkalemia. Echo on [**5-30**] which showed normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function with LV regional wall motion abnormalities as above
with mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation.

# GI bleed: patient with known erosive gastritis diagnosed on
EGD in [**2113**] on omeprazole 20mg PO Daily, but vomited bloody
bilious fluid in setting of aspirin, plavix, heparin and
integrilide drip.  Most likely this is from known gastritis.
Hemoglobin dropped from 9.5 to 8.1, he was transfused 1 unit
packed RBC's with appropriate rise in hematocrit which remained
stable during the rest of his admission.  On [**2118-5-30**]
patient complained of odynophagia, dysphagia for liquids, blood
tinged sputum, and a "reflux" feeling in his throat. The reflux
feeling improved with the addition of an H2 blocker and carafate
to his PPI, and we have continued him on ranitidine prn in
addition to his o
