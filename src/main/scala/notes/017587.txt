CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint of status post ventricular
fibrillation arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
acute myocardial infarction 20 years ago, status post
4-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2136**], status post
myocardial infarction in [**2151**] (with an right coronary artery
to saphenous vein graft stent), status post myocardial
infarction in [**2152**] (with an saphenous vein graft to left
anterior descending artery percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty; at that time had an ejection fraction of 40%),
history of diabetes, and hypertension who was admitted to
[**Hospital1 69**] after surviving a
ventricular fibrillation arrest on a flight from [**Location (un) 86**] to
Venezuelae.  The plane landed in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].

Per nephew, the patient had four to five weeks of progressive
chest pressure with exertion with increased use of
nitroglycerin.  He refused to seek medical advice at that
time.  Per wife, the patient has had angina for several years
but was told in [**State 2690**] there was no more they could do.  On
flight from [**Location (un) 86**] to Venezuelae, the patient had a
ventricular fibrillation arrest on Thursday evening,
automatic external defibrillator was used and with two to
three shocks was delivered from ventricular fibrillation.  No
available strips at this time.  The plane was diverted to
[**Male First Name (un) 1056**] where his nephew met him.  The patient was
intubated on the airstrip, but answering questions
appropriately at that time.

He was transferred to a second hospital in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] and
started on amiodarone drip, heparin drip, and nitroglycerin
drip. There, revealed an ejection fraction of 30%.  It was
reported that a maximum troponin of greater than 500 with a
maximum creatine kinase of greater than 16,000.  The patient
was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].

At [**Hospital1 **], the patient was lightly sedated, on
a propofol drip.  He recognized his wife and nephew and
answered all questions appropriately.  He denied any chest
pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
intubated, on assist control of 12, tidal volume of 900, FIO2
of 40%, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, temperature
of 102.4, pulse of 69, blood pressure of 99/55, respiratory
rate of 12, satting 95% to 99% on room air.  In general, a
middle-aged male, intubated, lightly sedated.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear.  Endotracheal
tube in place.  Mucous membranes were moist.  Jugular venous
distention not visualized.  Chest was clear anteriorly.  No
wheezes or rales.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate.  No murmur.  First heart sound and second heart
sound were normal.  There was a third heart sound audible.
Abdomen revealed bowel sounds were positive, soft and
nontender.  No rebound or guarding.  Extremities revealed
there was trace edema, cool extremities, good distal pulses
bilaterally.  No femoral bruits.  There was a large left
groin hematoma.  On neurologic examination, the patient was
lightly sedated.  He opened his eyes to command, comprehended
simple commands.  Skin revealed there was no rash.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed a white blood cell count of 13.7 (78% polys and
16% lymphocytes), hematocrit of 41.2, platelets of 170.  PT
of 13.6, INR of 1.3, PTT of 37.2.  Sodium of 145, potassium
of 3.5, chloride of 107, bicarbonate of 25, blood urea
nitrogen of 18, creatinine of 1.2, glucose of 117.  ALT
of 179, AST of 339, alkaline phosphatase of 58, total
bilirubin of 0.8.  Creatine kinases on admission were 8585;
MB of 14; with an index of 0.2, and a troponin of greater
than of 50.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed a right subclavian
line in the right anterior inferior vena cava, endotracheal
tube about 6 cm above the carina.  There was evidence of
cardiomegaly with pulmonary congestion.

Electrocardiogram on arrival revealed sinus rhythm at 72,
with normal axis, Q waves in V1 to V3, flat T waves
throughout, biphasic D in first diagonal, tall P in lead II.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted with
ventricular fibrillation arrest, likely in the setting of an
acute coronary syndrome given the fact that his troponins and
creatine kinases were elevated.  However, the patient
presented chest pain free.  His aspirin, Lopressor, Lipitor,
heparin drip, nitroglycerin drip were continued.  The
patient's creatine kinases were cycled; however, they
continued to remain elevated with a negative index.  The
patient's statin was held secondary to elevated creatine
kinases.  The patient was extubated on the following morning
and was stable.  The patient was sent for cardiac
catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization revealed an occlusion of the left
anterior descending artery at the site of the saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending artery graft.  The patient
also had two grafts that were occluded.  The native left
anterior descending artery was stented successfully, and the
patient was returned to the Coronary Care Unit.

The patient was continued on Plavix status post
catheterization and Integrilin.  The patient also had an
echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 15% to
20% with inferobasal aneurysm.  The patient was started on
anticoagulation for a low ejection fraction and a question of
an aneurysm; initial on heparin and then converted to
Coumadin.

Given the patient's ventricular fibrillation arrest, the
patient was taken for an Electrophysiology study which
revealed fossae of ventricular tachycardia, and the patient
was taken the following day for implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement.  Status post
defibrillator placement, the patient's chest x-ray was okay.
Interrogation revealed that the defibrillator was working,
and the patient was discharged with implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator in place, off amiodarone.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was admitted intubated on
arrival.  However, the following morning the patient was
successfully extubated and had stable room air saturations.
On hospital day two, after extubation, the patient developed
flash pulmonary edema and was treated with intravenous Lasix,
morphine, and nitrates.  The patient continued to be diuresed
aggressively (1 liter to 2 liters per day).  The patient
eventually regained stable saturations and was discharged on
a low dose of Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with a
question of pneumonia given a temperature of 102.4 and
question of a retrocardiac density on chest x-ray.  The
patient also with a question of dirty urine, consistent with
a urinary tract infection.  The patient was placed on
Levaquin and will be treated with a 14-day course.  The
patient remained afebrile during the rest of his
hospitalization.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient with a hist
