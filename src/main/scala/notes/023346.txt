Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Lipomatous hypertrophy of the
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderate AS (AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2) No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Torn mitral chordae. Mild valvular MS (MVA
1.5-2.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm.
Conclusions
Pre bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There is complex atheroma of the ascending, arch and
descending thoracic aorta. An epiaortic scan was conducted to
deliniate areas of least plaque/calcifcation for aortic cross
clamp and cannula prior to bypass. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. There is calcium
extending onto a significant portion of the posterior mitral
leaflet. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. A torn mitral chord is present, originating from the
posteromedial papillary muscle. There is borderline mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.8 cm2, 3.2 on recheck at higher
blood pressure). Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen, most prominent when blood pressure is in 170's systolic.
Vena contracta <.5 cm consistently.

Post byass: Preserved biventricular funciton. LVEF >55%. An
aortic valve bioprosthesis is seen (#23 magna per surgeons).
Peak gradient 12 mm Hg, Mean gradient 6 mm Hg post bypass. No
AI, no perivalvular leaks on aortic valve. Peak MR remains [**12-7**]+.
Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2192-4-20**] Mr [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR where he underwent
CABG x1 (SVG->PLB) and AVR (#23mm CE Magna pericardial) with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Cross clamp time=104 minutes, CPB time=130 minutes.
Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9379**] operative report for further
details.Mr [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition, requiring Neo and Propofol to optimize blood pressure
while sedated.All drips were weaned in a timely fashion and the
patient was extubated postop night. He was transferred to the
SDU floor on POD#1.All lines and tubes were discontinued in a
timely fashion. On POD#2 Mr[**Known lastname **]'s rhythm went into a rapid
atrial fibrillation. He was beta blockaded and started on
Amiodarone po dosing.Anticoagulation was initiated with
Coumadin. Day #3 his rhythm converted to NSR in the 80s.On POD
#4 Mr [**Known lastname **] was doing well and it was felt that he was ready
for discharge to rehab for further strength and exercise
