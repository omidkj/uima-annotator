History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75909**] is a 57 year-old male well known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
with a history of Afib, PE, s/p left pneumonectomy on [**2151-3-4**]
for T3N2 squamous cell carcinoma
discharged home [**3-10**], w readmissiom on [**3-13**] for failure to
thrive now with syncopal episode while at rest in bed and
generalized left sided chest pain. The patient saw Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic today. He looked well at the time.  He
awoke at midnight with generalized left chest pain and
diaphoresis.  He "passed out" for 60s according to his daughter.
 When he awoke he was alert and orientated and able to move all
extremities.  He denied visual symptoms, loss of sensation, limb
weakness, and loss of balance.  He denies fevers, chills,
nausea, vomitting, [**Last Name (LF) 75966**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] new neurological symptoms,
and any new muskuloskeletal symptoms.


Past Medical History:
1. T3N2 squamous cell carcinoma of the left main stem bronchus
diagnosed [**11-21**].  The initial tumor was a large, necrotic,
friable mass that completely occluded the left mainstem
bronchus; it was associated with left lung collapse and
bilateral hilar and right paratracheal adenopathy.  The tumor
was debrided and a stent was placed in early [**11-21**].  Treatment
with combination chemotherapy and XRT was started on [**2150-11-30**].
2. Pulmonary embolism [**11-21**].
3. Post-obstructive pneumonia [**11-21**].
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. Latent tuberculosis.
6. Pneumonia [**11-21**].

Social History:
70-pack-year smoking history.  He is living with his daughter,
[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] has three children, two daughters and one son, and he
has grandchildren.  He has not been smoking for one month.  He
occasionally drinks alcohol and denies illicit drug use or
abuse.  He was born in [**Country 5881**] and came to the U.S. roughly forty
years ago.


Family History:
Father died of laryngeal cancer.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2151-3-26**]
CT OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post left pneumonectomy.
In the pneumonectomy bed, there is heterogeneous fluid which
nearly fills the cavity as well as a small amount of residual
air. The fluid is quite heterogeneous with large foci of higher
density ([**Doctor Last Name **] 55-60) within it consistent with blood products.
Within this hemorrhage there are several blood-fluid levels both
in the intrapleural and extrapleural spaces in the left
hemithorax, generally seen in the setting of anticoagulation.
The hemorrhagic fluid extends into the left lateral chest wall,
as well. As reported on the concurrent chest radiographs, in the
span of one day, there has been reversal of the previously
leftward mediastinal shift. This suggests a short-interval
increase in the amount of fluid in the left pneumonectomy bed.
The post- contrast images demonstrate no area of active
extravasation, specifically, related to either the bronchial
arteries, or along the chest wall and the projected course of
the intercostal vessels.

The thoracic aortic contour is within normal limits. The heart
size is stable. There is a small non-hemorrhagic pericardial
effusion. Suture material is seen in the left hemithorax, where
there has been resection of the left pulmonary artery. The main
and right pulmonary arteries and their major segmental branches
are clear without evidence of pulmonary embolism. The right lung
demonstrates marked emphysema, as on the preoperative CT. There
is no area of consolidation. Minor dependent changes are noted.
There is no right pleural effusion. The left main stem bronchus
has been ligated. The right-sided bronchial tree is patent
without endobronchial lesion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous, predominantly high-density fluid within the
left pneumonectomy resection cavity, consistent with a prominent
component of acute hemorrhage. This in conjunction with the
reversal of the previously seen leftward mediastinal shift
suggests that the volume of fluid has increased substantially
since one day ago, due to acute bleeding.
2. No acute bleeding source identified at the pneumonectomy
margins. However, the presence of blood/fluid levels at time of
presentation is suggestive of underlying anticoagulation (or
coagulopathy).
3. No right-sided or central PE.
4. Non-aggressive appearing lesion in the left humeral head,
incompletely imaged, which may represent an enchondroma.

ECHO [**2151-3-26**]
IMPRESSION: Small loculated pericardial effusion without
evidence for hemodynamic compromise.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75909**] was admitted on [**2151-3-26**] for a syncopal episode at
home.  Upon arrival to the ED his blood results revealed an INR
of 6.0. A Chest CT was done and revealed heterogeneous,
predominantly high-density fluid within the left pneumonectomy
resection cavity, consistent with a prominent component of acute
hemorrhage.  He was treated with 10 mg IV Vitamin K , 1 unit FFP
and 1 unit of PRBC and 10 mg Decadron. He was transferred to the
SCIU for monitoring and remained stable. He was seen by
endocrinology and cardiology and neurology for his syncopal
episode.  No definite cause for his syncopal episode was found.
He had no further episodes while hospitalized. He transferred to
the floor and continued to do well with systolic blood pressures
in the 120-130's.  On HD #3 he was started on heparin with a
goal PTT 50-60 and monitored for bleeding.   On HD #6 he was
converted to LMW  and discharged to home.  He will follow-up
with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Hospital 620**] [**Hospital 197**] Clinic for
anticoagulation management.  He also will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
