History of Present Illness:
68 yo male with history of pontine cva '[**03**], htn, hyperlipidemia,
depression, recently finished course of abx for PNA, aphasic,
blinks to communicate (up/down is yes, side/side is no). Patient
presents with epigastric discomfort and diaphoresis first noted
at 5am on day of admission. Per the nursing home records, the
patient was found to be coughing and vomiting at 5am this
morning. At that time hew was diaphoretic, tachycardic and

intervention and fibrinolytics. The patient was started on a
Heparin drip, given Plavix load of 300mg and ASA 600mg. CXR
showed opacity in LLL obscuring diaphragmatic border. Patient
was given Levaquin and Clindamycin given recent history of
aspiration pneumonia. On transfer, patient's VS were 97, 122/72,
22, 100% on NRB. Patient was not given a beta blocker.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient reports persistent RUQ and
epigastric abdominal pain. He denies chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea or diaphoresis. He reports he has felt chilled,
but denies subjective fevers.

CT abd/pelvis
1. Slightly limited exam secondary to motion and streak
artifact. No bowel
obstruction, colitis, diverticulitis, or fluid collection.
Moderate-to-large
amount of stool retained in the colon and rectum.
2. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube and Foley catheter in place.
3. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely representing
atelectasis.

ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 10 %) with anterior,
septal and apical akinesis. No definite apical thrombus seen but
cannot exclude. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal (cannot exclude apical wall motion
abnormality). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary process detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33962**] is a 68 y/o M with a history of Pontine infarct
in '[**03**], with HTN, HPL, who presents after episode of epigastric
discomfort, found to have infero-lateral ST segment elevations
on ECG but negative cardiac enzymes.  Abd CT concerning for
constipation.
.
# Possible STEMI: Mr [**Known lastname 33962**] was hemodynamically stable on
admission but with EKG changes showing 1mm ST segement
elevations in I, AVL, and ST depression in II, III, AVF, LBBB
and complaints of epigastfic pain.  He refused
re-vascularization and cardiac enxymes x 3 were negative,
therefore this episode was thought to be a strain pattern in the
setting of LBBB.  His EKG did not change throughout the
admission.  Conservative management was initiatied in the ED
with anticoagulation and antiplatelet medication, however these
were discontinued when cardiac enxymes x 3 were negative. He was
discharged on his home doses of coumadin, aspirin, beta blocker,
and ACE-I.
.
# Abdominal Pain: Initially concerning for small bowel
obstruction given dilated loops of bowel on KUB and vomiting
this AM at the nursing home, however CT only showed stool with
no evidence of SBO. Surgery was consulted and G-tube was drained
to gravity while awaiting CT results.  He was initially kept NPO
but diet was restarted after SBO was ruled out and patient had
had two bowel movements.  He was initially started on
antibiotics given his abd pain and borderline fever, however
these were discontinued when his pain resolved with bowel
regimen and pt did not show an up-trending fever curve or WBC.
If abd pain returns on discharge, he may require up-titration of
his bowel regimen.
.
# Heart Failure: ECHO this admission showed poor LV function of
10% which was likely the result of a prior ischemic event rather
than an acute event.  On discharge he was continued on his home
cardiac meds to optimize medical management of his heart
failure.  He will follow-up with cardiology on discharge.
.
# Tachycardia: Patient has sinus tachycardia on admission with
LBBB, and this continued for most of the admission. It was
unclear if this is new as outside records had not arrived by the
time of his discharge. Most likely sinus tachycardia in the
setting of acute abdominal process, and was probably worsened
because the patient missed several doses of his home BB.  When
SBO was ruled out, he was given a fluid bolus as he appeared dry
and had been NPO, and tachycardia improved. Home nutrition was
also restarted.
.
# History of recent PNAs: The patient did not have a cough on
admission, however has a borderline fever and signs of
infiltrate on CXR. Since it has been only weeks since recent
PNA, may have post-PNA changes on CXR. Patient is oxygenating
fine currently. His respiratory status was stable throughout the
admission, and PNA was thought to be unlikely, therefore he was
not treated for PNA.
.
# History of Pontine CVA: Aspirin and statin were continued.
