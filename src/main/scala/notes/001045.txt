Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath; chest pain with radiation to left arm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Redo Sternotomy, Aortic Valve Replacement (21mm Biocore Epic)
[**2164-5-1**]


History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 80 year old
female with severe aortic stenosis and history significant of
CAD
s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, pulmonary
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, and worsening renal
insufficiency stage III.  The patient was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 51681**]
for
follow up of her worsening dyspnea, now having to sit after
walking as little as 3 steps.  This is a marked decrease to what
she could do 3-6 months ago.  She fatigues more easily and has
cut back on her activities wanting to sleep all the time.  She
also notes LUE pain that starts in the left arm and radiates
upward to the heart happens when she is short of breath.  She
also does have some chest pain that is exertional.  She sits
down
and it gets better rather quickly.  The patient is unable to
perform pulmonary function tests because of her difficulty with
performing the test.  An echocardiogram on [**2164-1-25**] revealed
severe aortic stenosis with peak transalvular velocity of 4.44
m/sec, peak/mean pressure gradiesnt of 79/45 mmHg, and
calculated
[**Location (un) 109**] by continuity equation of 0.5-0.6 cm2.  LVEF was 50-55%.
Cardiac catheterization revealed mild-moderate coronary artery
disease which will be managed medically.  She presents
pre-operatively for heparin prior to redo sternotomy.

Pertinent Results:
[**2164-5-1**] ECHO
PREBYPASS

A patent foramen ovale is present. There is a bidirectional
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The main pulmonary artery is dilated. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results on [**2164-5-1**] at 930 am.

POSTBYPASS

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Bioprosthetic
valve seen in the aortic position. It appears to be well seated.
There is mild aortic insufficiency noted at the junction of the
native non and right coronary cusps. 1- 2+ mitral regurgitation
present. Aorta is intact post decannulation. Rest of the
examination is unchanged.

Very poor transgastric views.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating Room on [**2164-5-1**] where
she underwent redo sternotomy, and aortic valve replacement by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative note for details. Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition. She was left
intubated and sedated overnight. She required packed red blood
cells for a postoperative anemia. On postoperative day one, she
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
She initially experienced intermittent hypertension which
responded well to Nicardipine drip. Warfarin was resumed for
atrial fibrillation but held after one dose due to
supratherapeutic INR. Over several days, beta blockade and
Diltiazem were titrated accordingly with much improved blood
pressure and rate control. However required titration down due
to bradycardia.  She responded well to Lasix, and dose adjusted
for diuresis. INR gradually improved, and low dose Warfarin was
resumed. She continued to progress and physical therapy worked
with her on strength and mobility.  On post-op day number 7, her
INR was 2.5, the coumadin dose was help on [**2164-5-8**].  On post-op
day 9, the patient's INR is stable at 2.6.  She will be advised
to take Coumadin 0.5mg on [**2164-5-10**], and INR will be followed
every other day until a steady therapeutic INR is achieved.  It
is now felt that the patient is safe to be discharged to
rehabilitation center on post-op day #9.
