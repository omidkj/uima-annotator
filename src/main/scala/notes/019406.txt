CXR:

Brief Hospital Course:
*)DOE - due to the increase in drainage and loculated appearance
of his persistent pleural effusions, this was thought to be the
most likely etiology of his worsening symptoms. The
Interventional Pulmonology team was consulted.  During the
course of the admission the IP team performed bilateral pleural
drains every other day until discharged.
.
*)CHF - on admission, there was no evidence of fluid overload on
exam, and his home medications, including furosemide, were
continued, in addition to close monitoring of fluid status.  He
had re-accumulation of fluid in his lungs with recurrence of his
symptoms and lasix were restarted. However, he  had difficulty
maintaining his blood pressure while on lasix, ace inhibitor and
beta blockers resulting in an admission to the ICU for
hypotension. The patient was minimally symptomatic during this
admission and was called out once his blood pressure stabilized.
His blood pressures remained low but stable throughout his
admission and cardiology was consulted to help titrate his
furosemide, ace inhibitor and beta blocker while maintaining
normotension.  Patient was eventually discharged on both his
beta blocker and lasix.
.
*)CAD - he is s/p CABG and pacemaker placement; on admission
there was no evidence of an acute cardiac event as an etiology
of his worsening dyspnea on exertion. An ECG did not show
significant change from prior, and he did not endorse any chest
pain, palpitations, or other cardiac symptoms. Home medications
were continued.
.
*)HTN - well-controlled during his hospital course. Home
medication regimen was continued.
.
The remainder of his medical issues were stable during his
hospitalization, and his home medications were continued.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of
breath. A CT scan of your chest did not show a clot in your
lungs, but did show an increase in the size of the fluid
collections around your lungs. You were seen by the
Interventional Pulmonology team, who drained the fluid from your
lungs on 7 occasions using the catheters you already had in
place.
.
We had to adjust your blood pressure medications during your
admission.
- Lisinopril was started and then stopped due to low blood
pressure
- Captopril which is in the same class as lisinopril was started
- Your Metoprolol Succinate was switched to Metoprolol Tartrate
50 mg twice a day.
