Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective ICD placement complicated by pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Defibrillator placement


History of Present Illness:
81 y/o M w/ HTN, HLD, anteroseptal MI [**2132**], sCHF (ef25-30%), and
OSA who presented for prophylactic ICD placement c/b pericardial
effusion and tamponade.
.
Mr [**Known lastname **] has had progressively worsening CHF. Per report he had
exercise MIBI in [**2156-11-1**] that revealed a large distal
anterior-inferoapical aneurysmal defect without reversibility.
His ejection fraction was 22%.  An echo also at that time
suggested an ejection fraction around 30%.
.
He underwent ICD placement for low EF. After the procedure he
had chest pain and echo showed a moderate pericardial effusion
with high density consistent with blood or inflammatory fluid.
There is brief RV invagination in late diastole without right
ventricular diastolic collapse. These findings are suggestive of
elevated intrapericardial pressure without frank tamponade.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 however because of low SBPs in the
70-80s, pulsus >20 and concern for tamponade he was transferred
to the CCU. In the CCU he complains of pain from the pacemaker
sight but denied SOB. He was given 2L IVF and his SBP improved
to the 100s.

ECHO [**2157-11-16**]
Poor image quality. A pacer/ICD is seen in the RA/RV. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is brief RV invagination in late diastole without right
ventricular diastolic collapse. These findings are suggestive of
elevated intrapericardial pressure without frank tamponade.
Close hemodynamic monitoring and repeat echocardiography are
suggested.
.
ECHO [**2157-11-17**]
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. LV systolic function appears
depressed. The right ventricular systolic function is depressed.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion with preferential
fluid deposition of up to 1.6 centimeters distally/apically, and
0.8 centimeters basally. The effusion appears circumferential.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation
or other cellular elements. A brief period of right ventricular
free wall invagination during late diastole is appreciated
consistent with possible early cardiac tamponade (clips 36, 37).


IMPRESSION: Limited study. Poor image quality. Small to
moderate, circumferential, complex pericardial effusion with a
brief period of right ventricular free wall invagination. No
exaggerated respiratory variation of mitral valve inflow
pattern.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-11-16**],
the size of the pericardial effusion and extent of cellular
debris/blood may be minimally smaller. A brief period of right
ventricular free wall invagination during late diastole is
somewhat more evident on the current study. Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
notified of the results in person.
.
CXR [**2157-11-18**]
A left chest wall single-lead AICD is noted, with the lead tip
extending to
the expected location of the right ventricle. There is no
pneumothorax.
Small effusions are not well evaluated on this portable
radiograph. Small
amount of scarring/atelectasis is seen in the right mid lung.
Hilar and
cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The aorta is tortuous.
There is nopulmonary vascular congestion or edema.

IMPRESSION: Little change from one day prior. No evidence of
vascular
congestion or pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o M w/ HTN, HLD, anteroseptal MI [**2132**], CHF, and OSA who
presented for prophylactic ICD placement c/b pericardial
effusion.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Pericardial effusion: He underwent ICD placement that was
complicated by pericardial effusion. He had a brief episode of
hypotension which responded to fluids and was not felt to be
tamponade. His Lasix and BP meds were initially held.
Repeated echo showed stable to mildly decreased size of the
effusion. His lasix was restarted but his atenolol, lisinopril
and imdur were not restarted on discharge because of his acute
kidney injury and low normal blood pressures on day of
discharge. These medications can be restarted as an outpatient
at the discretion of his PCP and cardiologist as his BP and
[**Year (4 digits) **] return to normal.
.
#Acute kidney Injury: His [**Year (4 digits) **] rose from 1.7 to 2.4 during
this admission which was felt to be related to decreased
perfusion from peri-procedural low BP in teh setting of his low
EF. His [**Year (4 digits) **] should be monitored to ensure improvement.

#Chronic Systolic CHF: Last EF 25-30%. Underwent successful ICD
placement for primary prevention of cardiac arrest. During this
admission he was briefly hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s-80s.
He was given 2L IVF with improvement of his BP. However he was
then mildly fluid overloaded. He received IV lasix with
improvement of his respirtory status. His weight on admission
was 105 kg and weight on discharge was 101.5 kg.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# CAD: H/O prior MI and now ischemic CHF. On ASA 325,
Atorvastatin 40mg, Atenolol, Lsinopril, Imdur, lasix as
outpatient. BP meds, diuretics, were held for hypotension and
[**Last Name (un) **]. Lasix was restarted prior to discharge.
.
# OSA: On BiPAP at home. Pt refused while in hospital.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#[**Last Name (un) **] elevation: Mr. [**Known lastname 94816**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] increased to 2.4 on
the day of discharge. Please follow his [**Last Name (Titles) **] to ensure
improvement.
.
#Blood pressure medications: His Lisinopril, atenolol and
isosorbide dinitrate were held at discharge. These should be
restarted at the discretion of his PCP and cardiologist pending
resolution of his [**Last Name (un) **]. Since atenolol is renally cleared,
substitution of metoprolol may be considered.
