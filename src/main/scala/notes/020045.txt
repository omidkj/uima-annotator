Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
79 yo M with a history of hypertension and diabetes found at
home with altered mental status. He was last seen on Saturday
[**2187-10-27**] at work and in normal state of health. He was found by
his family at home on Monday [**2187-10-29**] lethargic and confused. He
was initially able to respond to sons saying that he was OK,
then became unable to speak or communicate. His sons gave him
juice and sugar pills as he has been like this in the past when
hypoglycemic. He was then brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where he
was found to have a low grade fever of 100.4, leukocytosis,
hypertension to 200s/100s, acute renal failure, and
hypernatremia.  Head CT was negative for bleed.  He was
intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRI
and further evaluation of his mental status.

At [**Hospital1 18**], he The underwent MRI brain which showed small areas of
restricted diffusion on DWI in right parafalcine cortex.
Neurology was consulted and did not feel the patient had a new
stroke, and they felt his presentation was more consistent with
a toxic-metabolic picture.
.
The patient was successfully extubated, however, his mental
status never returned to baseline.  Possible contributing
insults, including hypernatremia and other metabolic
derangements, poorly controlled hypertension, and infection were
either corrected or ruled out.  The patient remained confused
and far from his relatively highly functional baseline per his
family.  No clear etiology of his mental status was found, and
he was transferred to the floor for further evaluation.

[**2187-10-29**] CXR: normal tube placement, no acute cardiopulmonary
process.

[**2187-10-31**] MRI/MRA brain:
1. Subacute infarcts involving paramedian right frontal cortex
and subcortical white matter, which may relate to distal
occlusion of A3 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery,
perhaps on an embolic basis. However, there is no evidence of
new infarction elsewhere in the brain.
2. Moderate chronic micro-ischemic change in bihemispheric
periventricular and subcortical white matter.
3. Moderate generalized atrophy.
4. Unremarkable cranial MRA with no flow-limiting stenosis.

[**2187-11-1**] Head CT: no mass effect or hemorrhage

[**2187-11-2**] TTE: Mild symmetric LVH with overall LVEF 50%. Increased
LV filling pressure.  Mild AV, trace AR, 1+ MR.  3+ TR. moderate
PAH.

Video swallow: Various consistencies of barium were administered
through out the exam. Both the oral and pharyngeal phases were
within functional limits. No premature spillover or oral cavity
oropharyngeal residue was identified. No aspiration or
penetration was observed during the exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Altered mental status:  Despite multiple studies and
extensive evaluation, no clear etiology was determined.  The
patient's mental status continued to wax and wane during the
hospitalization, however, never returned to baseline. He was
always able to provide his name, and was intermittently oriented
to place, but never oriented to situation or time.  Per his
family, the patient was relatively highly functional prior to
this event, and given the lack of improvement, the family agreed
to long term nursing facility placement.  At the time of
discharge, he was able to feed himself with supervision, and sit
in a chair safely.  He needed a lot of assistance moving and
changing position, and was intermittently cooperative with PT.
All sedating medications were held and blood pressure and blood
glucose were closely monitored.   The patient was very hard of
hearing, which limited effective communication.  The patient
should have neuropsychiatric testing in the dementia clinic one
to two months after discharge.
.
2. Hypertension: the patient has a history of renal artery
stenosis and difficult to control hypertension.  He had stenting
of his renal artery several months ago.  At the time of
discharge, his regimen included Clonidine TTS 3, Lisinopril 40
mg qd, Amlodipine 10 mg qd, Metoprolol 50 mg po bid (when heart
rate would tolerate), and Hydralazine 50 mg po q6.  The
patient's blood pressure was originally well controlled on
Labetalol, however, his low heart rate limited our ability to
give the drug. Per the Geriatrics Attending, clonidine is not an
optimal drug to use in elderly with dementia, therefore, if it
is ultimately possible to wean off some of the medication,
Clonidine should be the first withdrawn.
.
3. Diabetes:  The patient was maintained on sliding scale
insulin.  Low dose Lantus was restarted late in the admission.
The patient had high readings during the day but tended to have
a very low fasting glucose on the am labs.  The patient had a
history of hypoglycemic episodes from tight diabetes control.
HbA1c is 5.6%.
.
4. CAD/CHF:  LDL 67, no need for statin.  Continue betablocker
and ace-inhibitor as tolerated.  He had three sets negative
cardiac enzymes and his echocardiogram showed preserved LV
systolic function.  He had several episodes of NSVT, and
electrolytes were repleted as necessary.  At discharge, aspirin
and Plavix were restarted.
.
5. FEN:  He was initially on tube feeds via the nasogastric
tube.  He successfully passed a video oropharyngeal study, and
was able to eat by himself at the time of discharge.
Electrolytes repleted as necessary.
.
6. Disposition: The patient was ultimately discharged to a
skilled nursing facility.  His mental status never recovered
during this admission and the chance long term recovery of
memory and function is unpredictable.  His three sons and their
wives were very involved with the patient's care.  He was full
code.
