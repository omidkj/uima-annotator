History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 82yoM with multiple medical problmes including
CAD, CHF (EF 30-35%), CKD (Cr 3.2 on admission to rehab) who was
brought to the ED from rehab with SOB and confusion. In the ED,
he was combative and initially refusing vital signs. Initial
vitals: 97.8 74 136/53 18 96% 4L np. While in the ED, he calmed
but was noted to be delerious. When he fell asleep, O2 sats
dropped. He he was temporarily placed on a non-rebreather, but
when awoken was easily weaned back to nasal canula. On exam in
the ED, crackles were noted in the in right base. In the ED, UA
was done and was negative. Head CT negative. CXR was notable for
new R-sided opacity. No consults were called in the ED. VItal
prior to transfer: 154/63, P76, RR18, 100% on 3L NC
.
In her ED call-in, PCP was concerned about uremia. Pt has a
documented "cognitive impairment," but it is unclear what this
entails from the notes in OMR. Otherwise, the patient had been
quite functional at home prior to his [**2182-5-22**] admission, after
which he went to rehab where he has been since. Of note, last
admission, poor responsse to 120mg Lasix with metolazone 5mg.
.
On the floor, pt is unable to articulate words and not following
commands.

Studies:
CXR ([**2182-8-6**])
Limited study due to rotation demonstrates bilateral pleural
effusions with bibasilar airspace opacities, worst on the left
than the right, possibly due to atelectasis though infection is
not excluded.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2182-8-6**])
No acute intracranial process.

RENAL U.S. ([**2182-8-7**])
1. Stable large left mid-to-lower pole renal mass.
2. Mild stable left-sided pelviectasis.
3. Unchanged atrophic, slightly echogenic right kidney.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US ([**2182-8-7**])
1. Trace perihepatic ascites.
2. Doppler assessment of the hepatic portal veins and inferior
vena cava (retrohepatic and mid) shows patency and appropriate
directionality of flow.  No evidence of thrombus.

TTE ([**2182-8-8**])
there is a mobile echodensity seen in the left atrium at the
base of the mitral leaflet, near the aorto-mitral fibrous
continuity. This could be a vegetation or part of the myxomatous
mitral valve. A TEE would help clarify, if clinically relevant.
Moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction. Dilated and depressed
right ventricle. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe pulmonary
artery hypertension.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2182-8-15**])
1. No evidence of new hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or
infarction.  Study is somewhat limited by motion artifacts.
2. Small focus of altered signal intensity, unchanged from
previous study, likely representing hemorrhagic residuum in
right frontal lobe.
3. Increasing confluence of FLAIR hyperintensities seen in the
periventricular white matter, most likely indicating progression
of chronic small vessel infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 82yo M with CKD, CHF (EF 30-35%), and CAD
who was brought to the ED with AMS and hypoxia and admitted to
the ICU and later transfered to the medical floor and
hemodialysis was intiated.

# AMS:
The patient's altered mental status was thought to be possibly
due to delirium from an infection or toxic metabolic cause or
due to his uremia secondary to worsening chronic renal failure.
He was found to have LLE cellulitis and RLL PNA and was started
on broad antibiotics for these (initially vanc/zosyn then
changed to vanc cefepime).  His mental status improved
dramatically on the antibiotics.  An LP was considered, but not
performed as it was thought his pneumonia accounted for the
source of infection.  It was felt that while his uremia was not
the cause of such an acute change in his mental status, it was
felt that this was at least contributing to his apparent
baseline confusion.  His mental status continued to fluctuate
between AOx1 to AOx2-3, with obvious inattention and confusion
at times.

# Acute on chronic renal failure:
The patient was found to have a high BUN:Cr, although his feUrea
was not consistent with pre-renal.  The patient also had
recently started on colchicine which was inappropriately dosed
for his GFR.  He was resuscitated with IVF and his renal
function improved somewhat.  Renal was consulted and recommended
hemodialysis be started.  His feelings towards dialysis were not
fully known and it was determined that he did not have capacity
at this time to make the decision.  It was felt that by
initiating hemodialysis on this admission, the correcting of his
uremia may help his mental status to the point where Mr. [**Known lastname **]
