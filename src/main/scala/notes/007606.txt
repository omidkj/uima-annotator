INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (tape
not available)
of [**2104-10-1**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size. Mild
global LV hypokinesis. [Intrinsic LV systolic function depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Eccentric TR jet. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm). Based on [**2096**]
AHA
endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a
moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and echocardiographic data. Bilateral pleural effusions.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral

regurgitation. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2104-10-1**], biventricular systolic function is now
mildly depressed (global - without regionality) - may be related
to tachycardia. Moderate mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
artery systolichypertension are now seen.

Based on [**2096**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic
data.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o male presented from rehab with shortness of breath and
found to be in Afib with rapid ventricular response.

Hospital course is detailed below by problem:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - The
initial plan of treatment was for direct cardioversion, and the
patient was intubated for airway protection, as he was in
worsening respiratory distress when cardioversion was to be
done. During intubation, however, the patient spontaneously
converted to sinus rhythm. He was transfered to the CCU where he
was shortly extubated secondary to intolerance of ET tube and
hypotension preventing use of sedatives.
He was treated for atrial fibrillation with metoprolol for rate
control. He spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm several
times with relapse to atrial fibrillation, so he was not
cardioverted. Instead, amiodarone was started and he again
converted into sinus rhythm, which was his status at discharge.
He was also noted to have occasional episodes of NSVT during
which he was assymptomatic. He was anticoagulated initially with
a heparin drip which was eventually converted to coumadin with
an INR of 2.2 on discharge. Coumadin dose was halved with the
addition of amiodarone
