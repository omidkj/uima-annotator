Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11839**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture [**2103-7-19**].


History of Present Illness:
Pt presents from rehab today with headache and increased
confusion at rehab.
Pt recently discharged on [**7-14**] for an admission for headache and
altered mental status.  By the time of his arrival to the floor
during that admission his mental status changes had essentially
resolved and his headache was thought consistent with chronic
headache he has had for at least a month.  He had a CT scan
during that admission, which was stable.
.
Today, Mr [**Known lastname 84008**] neuro-oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] got a call from [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital **] Rehab Center reporting confusion.  Apparently the patient
was forgetting the details of his recent hospitalization and
confused as to where he was and where he had been.  Per his
wife, he has not participated in rehab since his recent
admission on [**7-13**] and has been consistently confused at rehab.
He also reported headache, which per the patient was unchanged
from what he has been dealing with for months.  This is
bifrontal and throbbing in character.  It has not improved with
treatment for sinusitis with fluticasone.  The patient also
reports he is unsure of the details of his confusion and feels
like he has been progressively improving.  Further details are
not available at this time.  The physician at rehab did not feel
comfortable managing the patient so he was transferred in to
[**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED initial VS were T 97.3, P 96, BP 126/85, RR 18, O2 92%
RA.  He complained of chronic headache but had no other
complaints  He had a CT head, which was stable as well as CXR
and UA.  His UA showed very mild pyuria and thus he received PO
ciprofloxacin *1.  He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in the ED who
thought he appeared stable from his previous baseline and was
ready to discharge him back to rehab but when the patient's wife
reported more chronically altered mental status a decision was
made to admit him for further work-up.
.
On the floor the patient cannot remember why he was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] but confabulates a story about needing to be brought
here to have a bowel movement (likely due to apparently asking
to defecate in the ambulance and being told he had to wait to
get to [**Hospital Ward Name **]).  He reports persistent headache.  He
reports his abdominal pain, which was an issue during his last
hospitalization has improved.
.
ROS:
+ Per HPI as well as for weakness (chronic) that he thinks is
improving
Denies fevers, chills, night sweats.  Denies change from chronic
intermittent diploplia.  Denies neck pain or stiffness.  Denies
chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, or cough.  Denies
acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Denies any
change in baseline weakness. Denies dysuria or foul smelling
urine.  Denies melena or hematochezia.  Denies vertigo.

[**2103-7-13**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1. No evidence of acute abdominal or
pelvic processes. 2. Bilateral common femoral and external iliac
thrombus small amount of thrombus within the infrarenal IVC
filter. New left common iliac vein thrombus is also noted. 3.
Stable bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral 4-mm lower lobe
nodules. 4. Hepatic steatosis.
.
[**2103-7-17**] CT head: 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, new mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. 2.
Post-treatment changes in the right temporal lobe. 3. Unchanged
left ventriculostomy and slight ventricular enlargement. 4.
Unchanged right sphenoid and mastoid/middle ear sinus disease as
described above.
.
[**2103-7-17**] CXR: Port-A-Cath is unchanged with catheter tip located
in region of the right atrium. Lung volumes are low with stable
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. VP shunt courses along the
left chest wall into the upper abdomen. No definite signs of
pneumonia or CHF. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
seen. Heart size cannot be assessed fully though appears grossly
stable. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Bony structures appear
intact.
.
[**2103-7-19**] CXR: No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
.
[**2103-7-20**] 24 hour EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous
ICU monitoring study because of severe diffuse background
slowing, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Background activity over the right hemisphere showed more severe
focal slowing and occasional sharp waves over the right temporal
region. These findings indicate a potentially epileptogenic
focal structural lesion in the right temporal region. Compared
to the prior day's recording, there were no significant change.
.
[**2103-7-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Lung volumes remain very low with
marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, chronic since at
least [**2103-5-13**]. Small accompanying right pleural effusion or
pleural thickening is also stable. Moderate cardiomegaly
exaggerated by low lung volumes, unchanged. Lungs grossly clear.
Right-sided central venous infusion port ends in the right
atrium close to the tricuspid valve.
.
[**2103-7-25**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased enhancement demonstrated within the resection
cavity, invo
