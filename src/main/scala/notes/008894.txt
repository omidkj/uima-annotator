CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old man
with known brain cancer (oligodendroglioma), who presented to
the ED on [**3-13**] with worsening mental status and a left
leg ulcer.  Patient had been increasingly confused over the
past few days and possibly had a fall a few days prior to
admission.

On the day of admission, VNA noticed an abscess on the left
leg and sent patient to the Emergency Room, where he was
found to be afebrile, but hypotensive with a systolic blood
pressure of 95.  Patient finished chemotherapy and also had
some partial seizures last week.  He has had seizures since
[**2165**].  Head CT [**3-13**] showed new bleed around temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle and at tip of the inferior
right temporal lobe.  In the Emergency Room, he received more
than 3 liters of fluid.  He was given stress-dosed steroids,
and he had an I&D of his left leg ulcer, and was started on
Zosyn.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Oligodendroglioma versus oligoastrocytoma anaplastic
diagnosed [**2166-3-24**].  [**2166-3-24**] he had a MRI for
infertility.  Later in the year he had temozolomide, and he
has had persistent seizures.  In [**2167-12-24**], he had an
increasing enhancement and was started on radiation therapy
as well as temozolomide and dexamethasone.
2. History of line sepsis.
3. Neurologic symptoms, encephalopathy secondary to tumor,
recent increase in weakness and inability to ambulate
possibly secondary to steroid myopathy.  In addition, he has
a left field cut in vision.
4. Hyperglycemia (steroid induced).

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Celebrex 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lamictal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Keppra 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Dexamethasone 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Valproate 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
7. Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Inderal 60 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Seroquel 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. prn.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is an anesthesiologist.  He lives
with his wife.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the
MICU for close observation overnight, and the patient did
well.  The following day he was transferred to the floor and
remained stable throughout.

1. Intracranial hemorrhage:  Repeat CT on [**3-14**] showed
no change from the previous day.  Neurology and Neurosurgery
were consulted.  Neurosurgery team felt that the bleed is
stable and there is no need for surgical intervention at this
time.  The goal is to keep the systolic blood pressure less
than 140.  No new neurologic deficits.  Hematocrit dropped
from 33 to 30 during this admission, which is felt to be
insignificant.

2. Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission, but
quickly responded to fluid challenge and blood pressure has
since been greater than 100 systolic.  Patient is
hemodynamically stable and has been afebrile since admission.
Was given stress-dose steroids for two days, and was switched
back to dexamethasone.  Also Inderal was held on admission,
and has not been restarted as blood pressure has been less
than 120 throughout admission.

3. Left leg cellulitis:  Patient was started on Zosyn for two
days and changed to Augmentin for one day.  He was finally
changed to Levaquin on the day of discharge as the patient
has concomitant questionable pneumonia.  Continue wet-to-dry
dressing changes b.i.d. with saline.

4. Hyperglycemia secondary to steroids:  Patient was
continued on regular insulin-sliding scale.

5. Hypertension:  Inderal was held on admission.  Blood
pressure is still borderline low, so Inderal was discontinued
altogether.

6. Seizure disorder:  Patient had been having seizures
lately.  Was taking Lamictal, valproate, and Keppra on
admission.  Neurology recommended stopping Lamictal, which
was done.  Valproate dose was increased on [**3-14**] and is
still subtherapeutic on the day of discharge.  This will need
to be followed up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**],
neuro-oncologist, was e. mailed to be made aware of the
subtherapeutic valproate level.

7. Brain cancer:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] from the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic will
follow up with the patient for one month.  For now, we will
begin a dexamethasone taper 2 mg p.o. q.d. for two weeks,
then 1 mg p.o. q.d. for two weeks, then 0.5 mg p.o. for two
weeks, then 0.5 mg p.o. q.o.d. for four weeks, then off.

8. Hypoxia:  Patient was noted to have an increased O2
requirement once on the regular medical floor saturating 90%
on room air from 97% on room air.  Chest x-ray on admission
was clear, but repeat chest x-ray two days later showed a
small bilateral pleural effusion with a questionable
infiltrate in the left lower lobe.  Decision was made to
treat with Levaquin for 10 days and encouraged use of
incentive spirometer.

9. Code status:  Full.

10. Low back pain:  Chronic.  Responds well to Percocet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage outside of oligoastrocytoma.
2. Brain cancer.
3. Left lower extremity cellulitis.
4. Question of pneumonia.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
on [**3-21**].  He is also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
two weeks.  He is also to have a followup MRI on [**3-21**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient is at baseline, somewhat
lethargic, but able to answer all questions.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Keppra 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Regular insulin-sliding scale.
4. Tylenol prn.
5. Percocet prn.
6. Valproate 500 mg p.o. q.8h.
7. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Dexamethasone taper as described above.
9. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for 10 days.
10. Potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o. q.d. for three days.
