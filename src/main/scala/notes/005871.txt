Stridor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
Central venous line (L subclavian) placement
Transesophageal echocardiography
PICC line placed

History of Present Illness:
79yo spanish speaking M Hx DM2, HTN, Pulm HTN, AF, [**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital 8**] hospital for further
evaluation/management of worsening stridor. Patient was
initially admitted to OSH on [**6-11**]. He presented complaining of
back pain and dysuria, and was found to have a Klebsiella
urinary tract infection, with ? urosepsis as well as ARF (Cr 2.7
from baseline 1.7). He was initially admitted to the ICU. During
his stay, he developed worsening stridor. Per report, he was
started on Solumedrol empirically. He evaluated first with a
chest/neck CT, which showed ? bronchomalacia, but no obvious
parenchymal disease. A laryngoscopy performed by ENT was
negative by report. He had bronchoscopy on the day of transfer,
which demonstrated moderate tracheal occlusion and significant
edema in the proximal [**12-30**] of the trachea (?extrinisc compression
vs malacia), RMSB with 50% circumferential/extrinsic occlusion
at the orfice, and 30% LMSB narrowing. There was moderate
mucous, but no endobronchial lesion or foreign body. He had been
treated with Solumedrol, and nebulizers, but did not tolerate
Heliox by facemask. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management by interventional pulmonary.

CT Chest: No evidence of external compression of the bronchi,
evidence of tracheobronchomalacia.
.
Transthoracic ECHO:  [**2189-6-17**] Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are  normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the  descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-29**]+)  mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. No evidence for endocarditis seen.
.
[**2189-6-24**]:  CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multilobulated right pleural-based mass without significant
enhancement, local invasion or associated thoracic
lymphadenopathy. No primary neoplasm identified elsewhere within
the torso. This may represent post- infectious sequelae,
mesothelioma, nerve sheath tumor or metastatic disease from
unknown primary. If clinically indicated, biopsy could be
performed.
2. No significant change in distal sigmoid colonic wall
thickening.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
79M initially transferred from OSH for interventional pulmonary
evaluation of worsening inspiratory stridor, which was later
identified as tracheobronchomalacia.  Other issues included
renal failure and metabolic derangement, resolving MSSA
bacteremia.  His current issues include a pleural based lung
mass, anemia with occult positive stool, infections, hepatitis
and paroxismal Afib.
.
A.  Pleural based mass:  Please see attached CT reports.  This
pleural based mass on the right was stable on his various CT
scans.  Radiology was concerned about it being a multilobulated
right pleural-based mass without significant enhancement, local
invasion or associated thoracic lymphadenopathy. No primary
neoplasm identified elsewhere within the torso. This may
represent post- infectious sequelae, mesothelioma, nerve sheath
tumor or metastatic disease from unknown primary. If clinically
indicated, biopsy could be performed.  Question as whether this
is an old finding or a more recent one.  Of note, his
respiratory status is stable on room air at time of transfer.
.
B.  Tracheobronchomalacia/COPD:  On initial arrival, patient had
severe stridor concerning for urgent requirement of intubation.
However, continuous bronchodilator treatment overnight induced
near complete resolution of the stridor, and urgent intubation
was not required.  On hospital day two, however, pt was
intubated for airway protection given continued poor mental
status and underwent bronchoscopy at that time which revealed no
airway stenosis or external compression without significant
tracheobronchomalacia.  Following stabilization, pt was
extubated and again required continuous bronchodilator therapy
(including racemic epinephrine) as well as corticosteroids as
empiric therapy for restrictive airway disease, with ultimate
resolution of stridor.  Therefore, it was felt that pt most
likely had bronchospasm as a result of his metabolic derangement
and renal insufficiency/uremia.  He has been stable on room air
for several days now with nebulizer treatments written prn. The
steroids are being tapered by 10mg of prednisone per day as his
respiratory status has been stable and there is a concern for
multiple infections including sigmoid colitis.  He is currently
on 40mg.
.
C.  Infections:  His WBC had trended down to about 11 but has
risen back up slowly to 18.  This can partly be attributed to
the steroid treatment, but also is concerning for infection.
1.  CT scan showed sigmoid colitis (please see attached
reports).  We do not think this is ischemic colitis as he was
ruled out with a normal lactate and bicarb.  Of note he was
occult blood positive and complained of abdominal pain
especially when defecating.  He is being treated empirically for
C Diff (antigen negative x2 thus far) and for gram negative
coverage with levoquin started today [**2189-6-25**]. Given his recent
high doses of steroids and his colitis, would have a low
threshold for
