Admission Date:  [**2175-4-29**]       Discharge Date:


Service:  Gold Hepatopancreatical Biliary

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
female who was admitted to the medical service on [**2175-4-29**], where she presented with a two day history of fatigue,
malaise, and generalized weakness with a one to two day
history of nausea and vomiting with coffee-ground emesis.
The patient denied any hematemesis, melena or bright red
blood per rectum at that time.  She reported that her last
bowel movement had been two days prior to admission and
normal.  She also complained of progressive weakness and has
a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastritis, diagnosed in
[**2174-8-24**] on esophagogastroduodenoscopy done at that time.

Before arriving at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], the
patient had presented to an outside hospital, where
nasogastric lavage done at that time revealed 700 cc of
coffee-grounds and no further emesis.  Her hematocrit on
presentation was 36.  She was admitted to the hospital with
serial hematocrits, hydration and was scheduled to undergo an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy the following day.  However, prior
to the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, she developed diffuse
crampy abdominal pain.

A nasogastric tube was placed at that time for 200 cc of
bilious material.  A KUB done showed dilated loops of small
bowel with air fluid levels.  There was no free air on
upright chest x-ray.  An abdominal CT scan done showed free
fluid in the pelvis with no free air, dilated loops of small
bowel with a transition point in the left pelvis and distally
collapsed small bowel.  The patient was then transferred to
the general surgery service, with plans to go to the
Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  History of recurrent
diverticulitis, status post sigmoid colectomy with a low
anterior resection in [**2167**].  2.  History of peptic ulcer
disease and gastrointestinal bleed.  3.  Status post total
abdominal hysterectomy.  4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Degenerative joint disease.  6.  Aortic stenosis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zoloft, Prilosec, atenolol,
Zestril, ampicillin, aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the
patient was afebrile at 98.6, heart rate 70, blood pressure
200/80, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 93% on two
liters.  General:  Alert and oriented times three, in
moderate distress.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Positive
bowel sounds, mildly distended, diffuse tenderness worse in
the left lower quadrant, positive guarding, positive
percussion tenderness.  Rectal:  Guaiac positive with no
stool in the rectal vault.  Extremities:  Warm.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 9.8, down from
16 on admission, hematocrit 30.6, platelet count 242,000,
liver function tests normal and amylase 56, lipase 15.  KUB:
As described above.  Upright chest x-ray:  No free air.  CT
scan of chest:  Chronic interstitial changes, bilateral
pleural effusion, right greater than left.  Abdomen CT scan:
As described above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on the evening of [**2175-4-30**], where she underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.
Intraoperatively, multiple adhesions were taken down and a
clear transition point was identified in the mid-jejunum.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There was minimal
blood loss, however, due to her cardiac history, she was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for
postoperative care.

Of note, the patient had been on levofloxacin and Flagyl
preoperatively for a presumed right lower lobe infiltrate
which was identified on admission chest x-ray.  She also
received Kefzol intraoperatively.  She had been extubated in
the Operating Room, however, her electrocardiogram showed
some ST depression so she was placed on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol.

1.  Neurologic:  The patient was placed on subcutaneous
morphine for pain control.  She remained neurologically
intact mostly, with the exception of some episodes of
sun-downing, with confusion and agitation.  However, she
responded well to small doses of Haldol and, by postoperative
day number six, was fully clear, awake, alert and oriented
times four.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's initial electrocardiogram
showed some ST segment depression and initial CK was negative
at 51, however, troponin was elevated to 3.4.  She underwent
a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed moderate to
severe depression in left ventricular systolic function with
a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% and mild to
moderate aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation and
severe pulmonary artery hypertension.

The patient was placed on low dose beta blockers and
intravenous hydralazine for blood pressure control.  She
continued to have elevated blood pressures and her beta
blocker, ACE inhibitor and hydralazine were titrated for
effect.  When she started taking orals, she was placed on
enalapril, clonidine and Lopressor with systolic blood
pressures in the 160s.  She had no episodes of chest pain
throughout her hospitalization and remained otherwise stable
from a cardiovascular standpoint.

3.  Respiratory:  The patient was extubated in the Operating
Room.  She initially had low oxygen saturations, for which
she was treated with chest physical therapy and gentle
diuresis with Lasix.  She was eventually weaned to a nasal
cannula with low oxygen requirement.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was kept on nothing by
mouth postoperatively, with a nasogastric tube in place.  Her
nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day number
two.  She continued to be nauseated with abdominal
distention.  On postoperative day number four, the patient
was less distended.  She was started on trial sips, which she
tolerated well.

5.  Genitourinary:  The patient had a Foley catheter placed
intraoperatively, with good urine output and no major renal
issues throughout her hospital stay.

6.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable and
was 29.9 at the time of discharge.

7.  Infectious disease:  The patient was placed on
levofloxacin and Flagyl preoperatively, however,
postoperatively, no antibiotics were given.  The patient
remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell count.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient is afebrile,
hemodynamically stable.  Her ambulation is somewhat limited.
She is tolerating a regular diet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is currently awaiting
acceptance at a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Complete small bowel obstruction, status post exploratory
laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.
2.  Aortic stenosis.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  History of diverticulosis.

6.  Degenerative joint disease.
