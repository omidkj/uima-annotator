Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Known lastname 1106**] surgery on [**2116-8-10**] and
underwent repair of the aneurysm in an extensive surgery which
lasted approxmiately 9 hours.  Intraoperatively she was observed
to develop multiple graft thromboses and had to undergo multiple
thrombectomies.  Her postoperative course was complicated by
respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure and ultimately
she was transitioned to comfort care and expired.  Prior to her
passing, her daughter (who is health care proxy) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
had a meeting in which she clearly delineated her mother's goals
for care, which did not involve aggressive escalation of care,
and she was transitioned to comfort measures only on [**2116-8-15**] and
passed away thereafter.  Her postoperative course is summarized
by systems below:

Neuro: She was maintained on versed and fentanyl postoperatively
for pain control and sedation; she demonstrated intact reflexes
and responses to stimuli initially and later in the hospital
course became less responsive.  When the transition to comfort
measures was made, she was maintained on versed and fentanyl
such that no signs of pain were noted.

CV: She was initially maintained with IV fluids however over the
2-3 days postoperatively she required levophed for blood
pressure augmentation.  Bedside echocardiogram x2 demonstrated
no evidence of cardiac insult.  She did have episodes of atrial
fibrillation with RVR which were treated with amiodarone.  On
[**8-15**] her pressor requirement increased and vasopressin was
added.  When the transition to comfort care was made, the
pressors were stopped and she expired.

Resp: She was maintained on CMV ventilation initially and did
transition to pressure support ventilation for a period of time
postoperatively.  However as she became hemodynamically unstable
she required increasing FiO2 and ventilatory support.  Chest
x-rays were largely unrevealing, and a bronchoscopy was
performed with BAL which yielded gram negative rods, and she was
treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia.  When
transitioned to comfort care she was kept intubated and remained
so at the time of her cardiac arrest, after which she was
terminally extubated.

GI:  She remained NPO.  She had multiple loose guiac-positive
bowel movements postoperatively however her abdomen remained
soft until [**8-15**], when she was found to have increasing abdominal
distention and rising lactate to as high as 8.5.  A general
surgery consultation was obtained and a laparotomy and possible
bowel resection was offered to her daughter, who declined this
escalation in care.  It was of the opinion of the general
surgery team that she may have ischemic bowel based on her exam
and rising lactate, which was likely contributing to her overall
global metabolic insult.

GU:  She was transitioned to CVVH due to her blood pressure
instability, and she was treated with bicarbonate for lactic
acidosis.  She remained anuric.  At the time of transition to
comfort care, CVVH was discontinued per her daughter's wishes.

Heme:  She was transfused RBCs and platelets and was found to be
profoundly thrombocytopenic.  Heparin products were avoided
given her history of HIT.

ID:  She was treated empirically for infection with vanc/zosyn
and then transitioned off zosyn to cefepime and flagyl given the
concern for thombocytopenia.  Flagyl was added on [**8-15**] to cover
for C.diff colitis however the margin of suspicion was low for
this infection.  WBC remained mildy elevated.

Dispo:  She was transitioned to comfort care on [**2116-8-15**] in the
evening and she expired peacefully within hours.  Her daughter
[**Name (NI) 8982**] was notified and she declined a postmortem exam.  The
medical examinar likewise declined a postmortem exam.
