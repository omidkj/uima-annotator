History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 3646**] is a 76 y/o F with hx of CAD, sCHF (EF 45% in [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2200**]), HTN, DVT on enoxaparin, and recent hospitalization in
[**Month (only) 1096**] for asthma exacerbation c/b resp failure requiring
mechanical ventilation, on home O2 2L NC, who came to the ED
today reporting 4-5 days of worsening SOB, accompanied by
substernal chest tightness and productive cough with sputum
production.  Also endorses orthopnea, and recently increased her
pillows from 4 to 6 at night.  No extremity swelling.  No
pleuritic chest pain.  No nausea or vomiting. She has had
worsening exertional dyspnea, though she is wheelchair bound and
only intermittently ambulates.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  99.4, 78, 180/106, 99% 4L NC.  Exam
initially unremarkable.  Labs included hgb of 10.4, normal
WBC/plt/chem7.  Cardiac biomarkers were negative.  BNP was 318.
U/a was negative.  CXR showed small bilateral pleural effusions,
but no pulmonary edema or consolidations.  ECG showed no new
ischemic changes.  BNP was normal and troponin was negative.
The ED team initially planned on having the patient undergo a
stress test, but she became acutely dyspneic with respiratory
rate in the 30s.  ABG 7.41/44/193 on BiPap.  She was treated
with methylprednisolone, magnesium, and nebulizers.  She was
also given benadryl, famotidine, and an epipen out of concern
for possible anaphylactic reaction--the patient has had itching
after taking her lovenox (last taken this morning).  The ED team
spoke with the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] reported that the patient has
been recommended to pursue [**Hospital3 **].  Prior to departing
the ED, her VS were 97.3, 80, 22, 128/71, 100% on Bipap.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was agitated and repeatedly
requested to be transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  Her only
physical complaint was of heartburn, no worse than her usual
acid reflux symptoms.


Past Medical History:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy.  EF 35-40% on ECHO in [**2198**].
3.  Asthma, though no PFTs in system and no documented outside
PFTs. uses 2LNC at home
4. Lower extremity DVT that was diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**] at an unknown
time and was treated for an unknown length of time, but this was
many years ago.
5.  Dyslipidemia.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Normocytic anemia.
8.  Chronic rhinosinusitis.
9.  Depression.
10. Adenoid hyperplasia


Social History:
Home: Lives in [**Location 686**] with her daughter (40 y/o) and
grand-son (16 y/o). However, the patient also states that her
daughter frequently disappears from home for a few weeks at a
time because she is "mixed up in drugs." The patient does not
currently know where her daughter is or how to get in touch with
her. She is tearful and worried when talking about her home
situation.
- Exposures: The patient states that there are no pets at home.
There is no mold, dust, construction in or around the home.
- ADL: The patient is wheelchair-bound at baseline but uses a
cane to take a few steps. Her activity is limited due to
musculoskeltetal discomfort as well as dyspnea. She is able to
dress and shower by herself.
- Smoking: denies.
- EtOH: denies.
- Illicits: denies


Family History:
She has several members of family with coronary artery disease
and heart attacks, no diabetes, no cancer reported.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o F with hx CAD, CHF, DVT and recent hospitalizations for
asthma exacerbation, presenting with progressively worsening
cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, and sputum production, with
hypertensive crisis on arrival to MICU. Respiratory status
improved without major intervention, and she was briefly on a
nitro gtt, then pt left AMA before anything could be done.
.
# Respiratory distress:  Unclear what patient's intrinsic
pulmonary dysfunction is due to, although prior documentation
suggests she wears nasal cannula at home and prior episodes of
respiratory distress have been attributed to asthma
exacerbations.  Pt had no oxygen saturation measurements on room
air in ED, and pO2 only measured while on Bipap, so degree of
hypoxia is uncertain, if any.  Symptoms of progressive
orthopnea, dyspnea on minimal exertion and leg edema suggestive
of CHF, although pt not grossly volume overloaded, CXR generally
clear, and BNP normal.  Sudden onset of symptoms in ED in
absence of exposure to asthma precipitants or allergens is
atypical for true asthma exacerbation.  No PFTs available in our
system.  No widened mediastinum or hemodynamic instability to
suggest aortic dissection.  Multiple reports of poor medication
compliance in OMR; pt may not be using home inhalers. We tried
to get PFT's but she left AMA prior to this. This was briefly
given prednisone but this seemed to make littler difference as
she was already at baseline after 12 hours in the MICU.
.

# Hypertensive urgency:  likely [**3-12**] epinephrine she got in the
ED (for what was thought to be an allergic rxn). Improved with
nitro gtt.  Generally normo/hypertensive in ED. on home meds
hctz and diltiazem
.
# CAD/Ischemic cardiomyopathy: No ischemic changes on ECG, trop
negative.  No chest pain.  Not on afterload reducing [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Ruled out for MI
.
# Lower extremity DVT: Unclear if taking enoxaparin at home,
though she tolerated it well in house.

# Dyslipidemia: c/w statin
.
# Normocytic anemia: hgb/hct at baseline
.
The pt left AMA before further intervention could be made
