Chief Complaint: Found at home altered

Reason for MICU transfer: Intubated and on pressors


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Mechanical Ventilation
Central Venous Access Placement
Continuous EEG monitoring


History of Present Illness:
65 yr/o F with history of [**First Name3 (LF) 2320**], steroid dependent asthma, CAD
with old MI presented to ED with altered mental status.

Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 2561**] and
diagnosed with a pneumonia. Discharged home yesterday on course
of cefpodoxime. This AM, family found her at home altered.
Called EMS who found her confused, poorly responsive, and not
following commands. Blood sugar was in low 60s but did not
improve with glucose administration. She was transported to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.

On arrival to the ED, VS - 98.6 77 103/63 18 97% 2L Nasal
Cannula. Found to have tremors UE bilat with some myoclonic
jerks, ? R sided gaze preference, not really following exams.
Strange breathing with periods of apnea, then rapid breathing.
ED thought seizures so gave ativan which didn't help. More
sedated and sats dipped to 80s. Due to this and concern for
airway protection was intubated so could get head CT. Neuro was
consulted. Didn't think this seizures, EEG didn't look that
concerning but recommended 24hr EEG. Head CT negative. After
intubation BP dropped to 80s and stayed there despite a couple
liters of fluid. Started on peripheral norepi and R IJ placed.
Given Vancomycin and Levofloxacin. BP 30min before ICU transfer
HR 60, BP 101/56, RR 16, 100% on AC, on norepi.

On review of information sent from [**Hospital3 2568**], there is a
discharge summary from [**Date range (1) 81029**] and then radiology and labs
from later in [**Month (only) 116**]. Discharge summary from [**Date range (1) 81029**] mentions
admission to r/o PNA without evidence of PNA although mentions a
recent pneumonia. Was given one day of abx and then stopped and
discharged. CXR from [**4-9**] read as patchy opacity of RLL
concerning for developing PNA. Also Air contrast exam of
esophagus with evidence of silent aspiration. Head CT on [**4-6**]
without acute changes, and CXR on [**4-5**] with retrocardiac
opacity. Labs from [**4-9**] with WBC 15.8, Hgb 13.3, Hct 39.5, Plts
187. Discharge med sheet from [**Hospital3 2568**] showing Cefpodoxime
200mg [**Hospital1 **] to be taken for 10 days until [**4-19**] (meaning must have
been started [**4-10**]).

On arrival to the MICU, intubated and sedated. No family present
and currently trying to identify contact information.

[**2139-4-16**] 3:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):

[**2139-4-16**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.  Please note
that MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute stroke.

[**2139-4-16**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background rhythm and occasional bursts of
generalized slowing. These findings indicate a widespread
encephalopathy, affecting both cortical
and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and infection are among the most common causes. There were no
areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features.

[**2139-4-17**] Chest x-ray:
Mild interstitial edema is new, accompanied by increasing
moderate
cardiomegaly and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 Focal
abnormality at the bases of both lungs, not as readily visible
now as it was on [**4-16**], could be pneumonia but is readily
explained by atelectasis. Pleural effusions are small if any.
No pneumothorax.  ET tube and right jugular line are in standard
placements and nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and
out of view.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yr/o F with multiple medical problems and recent admission to
[**Hospital6 4287**] for pneumonia (discharged yesterday) found
today at home poorly responsive.  There was concern that patient
was having seizures, she recived ativan in
