CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: determine extent of injury, please perform Recon for TLS

Field of view: 38 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man with GSW to left posterior chest
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
determine extent of injury, please perform Recon for TLS
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 22-year-old man with gunshot wound to left posterior
chest.

No prior comparison exams are available.

CT OF THE CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images are obtained through the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast only per
trauma protocol. Coronal and sagittal reformations were
evaluated.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Minimal amount of
loculated pneumothorax is noted medially within the anterior and
posterior right chest with dense consolidation and patchy
ground-glass opacities noted predominantly within the right
upper lobe, likely representing underlying alveolar
hemorrhage/contusion from a known gunshot wound. A small amount
of hyperdense pleural fluid is noted posteriorly with bilateral
atelectasis portions of the lower lobes noted. The heart and
great vessels appear unremarkable. The airways appear patent to
the subsegmental level. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes
are identified. The chest tube is noted coursing posterior
medially within the right hemithorax. Nasogastric tube
terminates within the distal esophagus. Subcutaneous emphysema
is noted along the right lateral chest wall from a chest tube
insertion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Mild amount of
hypoattenuation is noted symmetrically along the portal vessels
consistent with periportal edema, likely reflecting aggressive
resuscitation. A small hypoattenuating lesion measuring
approximately 8 mm is noted in the right lobe, too small to
characterize but likely benign. The gallbladder displays a mild
amount of fluid surrounding it, also likely related to
aggressive resuscitation. The spleen, pancreas, stomach,
intra-abdominal bowel, adrenal glands, and kidneys all appear
unremarkable. No free air or free fluid of collections are noted
within the abdominal cavity. No pathologically enlarged lymph
nodes are present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Intrapelvic bowel,
prostate, and a Foley-containing urinary bladder appear
unremarkable. No free fluid collections are noted within the
pelvic cavity. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are
identified.

BONE WINDOWS: Fracture with displaced fragments along the bullet
tract is noted involving the inferior right scapula and right
lateral third rib. Small metallic bullet fragments are noted
along the posterior chest. A comminuted fracture of the T3
posterior pedicles and transverse processes adjacent to multiple
bullet fragments is present with displaced ossified fragments
within the central canal. The largest bullet fragment is located
just adjacent to the canal extending along the right pedicles of
T2 and T3. Additionally, a small fragment appears to be located
within the right central portion of the spinal canal at T2-T3
interspace. A minimally displaced fracture is also likely
present involving the right right T2 transverse process and
pedicle.

IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple bullet fragments predominantly centered at T2 and T3
with a few fragments noted to be within the spinal canal.
Comminuted fracture with displaced osseous fragments into the
canal involving the posterior elements T3 (transverse process
and pedicles) and right T2 posterior elements. Additional
fractures along the bullet tract involving the right inferior
scapula and third right lateral rib.

2. Dense predominantly right upper lobe consolidation containing
air bronchograms likely represents extensive
hemorrhage/contusion from underlying injury. Minimally loculated
medial pneumothorax noted anteriorly and posteriorly within the
right chest. Small amount of hyperdense pleural fluid.

3. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.

4. Mild periportal edema and edema within the gallbladder fossa
likely reflective of aggressive fluid resuscitation.

CT THORACENTESIS W/TUBE PLACME; CT GUIDED NEEDLE PLACTMENT

Reason: want a pigtail drainage of the right lower lung
hydropneumot

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man with collection in the right base of the lung
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
want a pigtail drainage of the right lower lung
hydropneumothorax
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT-GUIDED CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT

HISTORY: 22-year-old male with collection in the right lung and
right-sided pneumothorax.

Limited axial CT images through the chest obtained with patient
in left lateral decubitus position demonstrate a right-sided
chest tube in place with its tip in the right posterior
hemithorax. There is a large right-sided consolidation involving
mid-to-posterior porion of the right lung. A right- sided
pneumothorax is present.

Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, initially, an attempt to place a
12 French and consequently 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheters was made
which was unsuccessful. Using CT fluoroscopy for guidance, an 8
French stiff catheter was then successfully placed into the
right posterolateral pleural space in the region of the
pneumothorax. Satisfactory position of the cathter tip was
verified with CT images. The catheter was secured to the skin
using skin fasteners. The chest tube was set to suction.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate
complications occurred.

CONSCIOUS SEDATION: The patient received a total of 125 mcg of
fentanyl and 2 mg of Ativan during the procedure and was
continuously monitored by registered nurse in the CAT scan
suite.

The patient tolerated procedure well and no immediate
complications occured.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of an 8 French chest tube.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man with transection of cord at T2, Removal of Chest
Tube.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for ptx
AP CHEST

INDICATION: Removal of chest tubes. Pneumothorax on right side.

A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2200-6-21**] at 09:14 hours
and compared with the prior evening's radiograph. The study is
performed supine. There is increased opacification in the right
hemithorax compared to the left which may indicate some laye
