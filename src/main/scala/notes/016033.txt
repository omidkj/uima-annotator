Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity worsening ischemia and non-healing
wounds.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2197-10-23**] Right below knee amputation
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Placement of left radial arterial line
Direct Current Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
65M with multiple medical problems s/p L SFA to AT bypass on
[**7-24**] that failed and thrombectomy of the graft at that time,
which was also unsuccessful, requiring multiple toe amputations
and most recently a left BKA now presenting from nursing home
Academy Manor with worsening ischemia and non-healing wounds on
the RLE. Apparently he was being treated with Vancomycin 750
q36hrs for his wound infections, but that was most recently
switched to Linezolid as wound cultures came back with Vanc
resistent enterococcus, as well as Morganella Morganii sp and
Klebsiella.


Past Medical History:
#. H/o MRSA, VRE infections
#. H/o ESBL in the urine in [**6-/2197**]
#. Peripheral vascular disease
#. Coronary artery disease: The patient reports a "massive heart
attack" 16 years ago. No intervention at that time. He is
recently s/p cardiac cath [**6-/2197**] with DES to Left circumflex,
and POBA to D1
#. Chronic systolic heart failure: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with
regional hypokinesis. EF=45%. Patient reports frequent
admissions for HF and dependence on lasix. He has been
chronically on oxygen, 2-3L for approximately 2 months, which
has not been weaned secondary to frequent hospitalizations.
#. Statin induced immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy - on
Cellcept and prednisone, history of weakness requiring
intubation s/p treatment with IVIG as well as Rituxan.
#. Hypertension
#. Gastro-esophageal reflux disease
#. Hypothyroidism
#. Diabetes mellitus type 2
#. Dyslipidemia
#. chronic anemia

PAST SURGIGAL HISTORY:
#. Left superficial femoral artery to left anterior tibial
bypass [**7-24**]
#. Thrombectomy of graft [**8-23**],
#. Multiple toe amps (1st toe Right foot, 1st/2nd/5th toe Left
foot)
#. Left BKA on [**8-15**], recently discharged


Social History:
Lives in a rehab facility. Has never smoked. At baseline the
patient is quadriplegic, secondary to the necrotizing myopathy,
although is able to feed himself if someone cuts up his food.

Path:
Right lower extremity; below-the-knee amputation (A-J):
Cutaneous ulceration, acute inflammation and necrosis.
Calcified atherosclerosis.
Histologically viable soft tissue margins. Bony margin, no
diagnostic abnormality recognized.

EEG:
([**11-22**]): This is an abnormal video EEG study due to periodic
generalized sharp and slow wave discharges with bifrontal
predominance
at 1-1.5 Hz frequency. These findings are suggestive of cortical
irritability and potential for epileptogenesis. However, no
electrographic seizures were seen during this recording. This
telemetry
captured one pushbutton activation but did not contain an
electrographic
seizure. Brief views of the background rhythm show a
disorganized mixed
theta/delta activity consistent with a moderate to severe
encephalopathy. No areas of focal slowing were seen in this
recording
although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.

([**11-17**]): This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. No electrographic seizures or epileptiform
discharges were
seen. The background was very slow throughout the day's
recording
suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.

([**11-16**]):  This is an abnormal video EEG study because of initial
continuous periodic epileptiform discharges at 1.5-2 Hz
consistent with
non-convulsive status epilepticus. These abated after treatment
with
intravenous phenobarbital. After 7 p.m., there were no further
definite
electrographic seizures but periodic discharges occasionally
recurred
in brief runs at frequencies less than 1 Hz. Interictal
background
activity showed severe diffuse slowing and attenuation of faster
frequencies consistent with a severe diffuse encephalopathy

([**11-13**]): This 24 hour video EEG telemetry demonstrated
generalized and
bifrontal, spike and sharp wave discharges that evolved into
periods of
sustained, rhythmic discharges, consistent with an underlying
non-convulsive status epilepticus. There were no apparent
clinical
manisfestations on video associated with the status epilepticus.

MRI Head: No acute intracranial abnormality present. Pooled
nasopharyngeal secretions and under-pneumatized mastoid air
cells bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30048**] is a 65 year old man, with h/o PVD, CAD, DM2, s/p
remote L BKA, and statin-induced immune-mediated necrotizing
myopathy, who presented on [**10-18**], with a right LE
ulcer/osteomyelitis to the vascular service.  He was started on
IV linezolid, cipro, flagyl, and underwent right BKA on [**10-23**].
His course has since been complicated by a. fib with RVR s/p
DCCVx1, hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**10-27**],
prompting intubation and pressor support, as well as status
epilepticus.
.
Course on Vascular Service
.
Post-operatively, in the PACU, the patient had hypotension
96/40, with minimal oozing from wound; the patient recieved
fluids and was transfused packed red cells, eventually started
on Neo drip, with stabilization of BP, and was transferred back
to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 VICU with Neo drip.  Over the next day, the patient's
blood pressure was stable, and the Neo drip was weaned off. He
was also started Hydromorphone IV for breakthrough pain. His
Tmax was 101.0, and his R LE wound swab grew Pseduomonas. On
[**10-25**] @ 0847AM, the pt was noted to have A. FIB with RVR 160s,
SBP 95/60s->60/40, prompting re-starting the neo gtt and
transfer to CVICU with cardiology consultation.  The pt received
direct cardioversion x 1, and converted to NSR. He received IV
amiodarone load x 24hrs, then coverted to oral dosing x 1 week.
He was also started on heparin gtt, which was transitioned to
oral comadin. Cardiac enzymes were obtained, and his troponin
ranged from 0.40 to 0.53, with flat CK, MB peaked at 10. TTE was
obtained without new focal wall motion abnormality. Ca
