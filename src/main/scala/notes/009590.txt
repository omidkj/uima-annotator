Pertinent Results:
[**9-16**]: CT head:
1. Acute epidural hematoma (8mm thickness) along the left middle
cranial fossa with mixed attenuation suggesting active bleeding.
No signs of herniation at this time.
2. Parenchymal contusion and small extra-axial hemorrhage
involving the right temporal lobe.
3. No fracture. Soft tissue/scalp hematoma posteriorly.

[**9-17**] CT head:
IMPRESSION: No change in left subdural or right temporal fossa
hemorrhages

[**9-17**] Tibia/Fibula/Ankle bilateral:
Right lower extremity: comminuted mid shaft tibial and fibular
fracture
Left lower extremity: left knee is congruent. Cross-table
lateral demonstrates no lipohemarthrosis. Left tibia,fibula,
ankle joint appear intact.

[**9-17**] Lower extremity fluoroscopy, intra-operative for ORIF right
tibia/fibula: Status post ORIF of the tibia with antegrade
intramedullary nail and interlocking screws. The hardware is
intact. Improved alignment of the comminuted tibial diaphyseal
fracture. Improved alignment of the comminuted fibular
diaphyseal fracture.

[**9-24**] CT Abdomen/pelvis:
1. Liver laceration in the right lobe of the liver, through
segment VII
extending to the IVC, with no definite active extravasation of
contrast to
suggest active bleeding.
2. High-attenuation ascites in the abdomen and pelvis,
consistent with old
hemorrhagic component.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.

[**9-27**] CT head:
1. Expected evolution of a right inferior temporal lobe
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
2. Evolution of blood products within a left parietal epidural
hematoma.
Stable non-displaced left parietal skull fracture.
3. Left temporal lobe extra-axial collections are much less
apparent. No new hemorrhage.

[**9-28**] HIDA scan:
1. Probable bile leak with accumulation of radiotracer just
above
the superolateral aspect of the right lobe of the liver.
2. Delay in gallbladder filling.

[**9-28**] RUQ U/S:
1. Large right hepatic lobe hematoma with central liver
laceration extending from the liver capsule to the intrahepatic
IVC. The laceration itself has decreased in size from the CT,
however, the surrounding hematoma is more apparent on the
current examination.
2. Moderate subcapsular hematoma with mass effect on the
superior and
posterior right hepatic lobe appears essentially stable from CT,
although,
direct comparison is difficult.

[**10-7**] CXR:
Large right pleural effusion has markedly increased. The
cardiomediastinum is mildly shifted towards the left side. Left
lower lobe retrocardiac
atelectasis is unchanged. Drains project in the upper abdomen.

[**10-7**] CXR:
the patient has received a new right-sided catheter. The tip of
the catheter projects close to the midline. The previously
placed right pleural catheter is in unchanged position. Extent
of the pre-existing right pleural effusion has further
increased. Only a minimal part of right apical lung is
ventilated. The left lung is unremarkable, apart from a small
left basal atelectasis. No left pleural effusion. Known right
clavicular fracture

[**10-10**] CT Chest:
1. Pulmonary emboli.
2. Decreased amount of right pleural effusion but with new
loculation.
3. Interval drainage of subcapsular fluid collection with large
persistent
hypodense area in the liver associated with parenchymal injury
4. Small lung nodule (4 mm) in the left upper lobe, of doubtful
clinical
significance.
5. Comminuted complete right-sided clavicle fracture.

[**10-16**] CXR:
Since the prior study, there is no substantial change in the
partially
loculated right pleural effusion. Right basal atelectasis as
well as the
position of the right chest tube are unchanged. Left lung is
clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 year-old female, unhelmeted bicyclist struck
by car who was admitted to Acute Care Surgery and subsequently
transferred from field, and intubated after deterioration of her
neurologic status.

Her immediate list of injuries included:
- Left acute epidural hematoma
- Left subdural hematoma
- Liver laceration
- Right open tib/fib fracture
- Right midclavicular fracture

Pt was emergently transferred to operating room for exploratory
laparotomy and 2 quadrant packing with open abdomen and RLE
ORIF/VAC placement which went well without complication (reader
referred to the Operative Notes for details) and subsequently
transferred to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for
evaluation and treatment of polytrauma.  Attending of record was
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the Acute Care Surgical Service. The patient arrived
to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit intubated/sedated, on
IV fluids, IV antibiotics, with a foley catheter, nasogastric
tube, VAC dressing, and fentanyl for pain control.  The patient
required minimal single-[**Doctor Last Name 360**] vasopressor for BP parameters.
