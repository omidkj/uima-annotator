Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty in breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 82 year-old female with a history of NSCLC
(stage IV) who presents with shortness of breath.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening
before admission when she began to feel somewhat short of
breath.  The next morning, this sensation persisted, so she
became concerned.  She also reports a few day history of a
non-productive cough.  Denies sick contacts, recent travel or
sedentary lifestyle.  She denied chest pain, fever, chills,
dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.  She presented to the ED
where she was found to be hypoxic to the 70s on room air.
.
In the ED, she was placed on a non-rebreather with sats up to
the high 90's.  Attempts were made to wean her to NC but they
were unsuccessful, as she was satting 88% on 4L NC.  She
remained afebrile in the ED but was found to have WBC of 17.
Given that, she received levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Blood
cultures were drawn prior to antibiotic administration.  CXR did
not show PNA, but demonstrated progression of known lung cancer.
 She underwent a CT head to rule out metastases, which was
negative.  On transfer, patient was afebrile with HR- 77, BP-
112/49, RR- 16, SaO2- 98% on 15L NRB
.
On transfer to the ICU, the patient was stable and comfortable.
Sats were 97% on 5L NC and 95% high-flow with a face-tent.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower
extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria,
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision
changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI [**2134**] s/p CABG [**2165**]
Hypertension
Dyslipidemia
CVA: small left posterior frontal infarct in [**12/2164**]
Macular Degeneration
NSCLC- stage IV (oncology history below)
.
-- [**12/2165**] presented in with unresolving right-sided pulmonary
infiltrate and an unrelated myocardial infarction.
-- [**2166-1-2**] Sputumcytology confirmed adenocarcinoma with a
pattern of stainpositivity consistent with lung origin (CK7 and
TTF-1 positive). She had stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer,
based on the multiple intrapulmonary lesions. She has no
evidence of extrathoracic or central nervous system involvement
with metastasis.
-- [**2166-1-7**]--->[**2166-5-6**]: Status post 6 cycles of pemetrexed
500->400>200 mg/m2 on [**2166-1-7**], [**2166-1-28**], [**2166-2-18**], [**2166-3-11**],
[**2166-4-1**], and [**2166-5-6**].  Her course was complicated by
cytopenias and development of increased creatinine levels.
-- [**2166-5-23**] Chest CT showed partial response with interval
improvement in the consolidation of the superior segment of the
right lower lobe and nodular densities of the left lower lobe.
Still widely disseminated BAC.
-- [**2166-8-13**] CT Chest shows increased density of right lower lobe
consolidation and worsened peribronchiolar ground-glass
opacities
in the lingula are most consistent with worsening of widely
disseminated non-small cell lung cancer, much less likely due to
infection.
-- [**2166-10-2**] Chest CT: slight interval progression of known
disease, no new sites.


Social History:
30 pack-year history of smoking.  Patient quit in [**2164**] but
resumed again.  Currently smokes 1 pack per week.  Drinks
socially.  Denies drug use. Married and lives with her husband.
She is a retired court reporter.


Family History:
Her father died due to CAD at age 52. Her mother had stomach
cancer and osteosarcoma. No history of lung cancer, colon cancer
or breast cancer.

CXR: [**2-13**]
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy. The
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There
continues to be progression of disease with increased extent of
consolidative opacity within the right lung base. Ill-defined
opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe are similar to
prior. Small right pleural effusion is present. There is no
pneumothorax. There is hyperinflation of the lungs.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of disease progression.
.
CT Head: [**2-13**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or
recent infarction. An area of encephalomalacia in the left
frontal lobe,
compatible with chronic infarct is unchanged. Prominence of the
ventricles
and sulci reflects generalized atrophy, notably in the bifrontal
extraaxial spaces. Areas of periventricular and subcortical
white matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process or mass
effect
.
LENIs: [**2-14**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
CT chest [**2167-2-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass
opacities,
bronchiolar nodules and dense consolidation within the lingula
and right
middle lobe. After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays
and CTs, these findings can all be explained by worsening
bronchioalveolar carcinoma, given the absence of any change
rapid enough to suggest pneumonia. Of course pneumonia might be
present and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on the
basis of clinical findings.
2. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
3. Moderate emphysema.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
82yo female with NSCLC stage IV presents with hypoxia.
.
#. Hypoxia. On admission patient with chief complaints of
progressive shortness of breath and non-productive cough. No
home oxygen requirement at baseline. On admission she was placed
on NRB for treatment of O2 saturations in 70s saturations in the
70s.  Admission CXR with no definite infiltrate, though concern
for progression of her known lung disease. In setting of
elevated WBC. concern for infectious process and empirically
treated with l
