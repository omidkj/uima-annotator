[**2116-11-19**] Cytology of Thoracentesis fluid:
"Atypical cells favor reactive mesothelial cells and inflammtory
cells."
.
[**2116-11-20**]: TTE:
"The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no
pericardial effusion."

[**2116-11-25**] Cytology of Thoracentesis fluid:
"NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Scattered lymphocytes and
proteinaceous material."

[**2116-11-27**] Video Swallow Study:
"Single episode of aspiration of nectar thickened liquids on the
initial bolus during premature spillover. Prominent residual

[**2116-11-28**] CT Chest:
"1. Bulky adenopathy within the mediastinum and both hila
resulting in compression of left lower lobe bronchus
2. New bilateral moderate/large pleural effusions.
3. Right upper lobe patchy pulmonary parenchymal opacity which
could represent the patient's known pneumonia or metastatic
disease.
4. Unchanged retroperitoneal adenopathy, left chest wall and
scapular masses 5. A lytic lesion of the T12 vertebral body
extends to the osseous margins of the central spinal canal and
results in possible spinal cord compression at this level."

[**2116-11-29**] Unilateral US of UE:
"No evidence of venous thrombosis."

[**2116-11-30**] Cytology of Thoracentesis fluid:

.
[**2116-12-7**] Portable CXR:
"Interval improved aeration in left upper lobe and left
perihilar region, corresponding to reduction in left effusion
and adjacent atelectasis, with residual moderate to large
loculated left effusion.
Stable right sided effusion"
.


Brief Hospital Course:
   The patient was intubated in the ED for respiratory distress
and hypoxia.  He was immediately admitted to the MICU on
[**2116-11-18**] where he was found to require dopamine for maintenance
of blood pressure.
.
1.  Respiratory distress: On admission, the respiratory distress
was thought to be secondary to mixed hypoxic hypercarbic failure
secondary to pneumonia and left pleural effusion.  While pending
work up for his respiratory distress, the patient self extubated
himself on [**11-20**].  He was relatively stable from a respiratory
standpoint until the 15th when he experienced acute respiratory
distress requiring BIPAP.  This was thought to be secondary to
fluid overload after mobilization of fluids after receiving
several liters of hydration as per the sepsis protocol and
pressure support. The patient was given a ten day course of
Zosyn which he tolerated well for the PNA and a thoracenetesis
with chest tube placement for the presumed malignant pleural
effusion (2.5L of exudative fluid was removed, however 3 sets of
cytology all returned negative for malignant cells).  The
patient subsequently recieved a pleurodiesis from interventional
pulmonary as well.  After pleurodesis, pt became tachycardic and
tachypnic (to 12
