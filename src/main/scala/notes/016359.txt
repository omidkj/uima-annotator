disease with a recent admission to [**Hospital6 1130**] in [**Month (only) 1096**], COPD taking home nebulizer, asplenia
Fragmin, in usual state of health until the date of
admission. Over the course of the day, the patient noted
worsening of her shortness of breath associated with nausea,
but no vomiting, ear condition and cough, which was
nonproductive.  Measurement on ambulatory room air saturation
at 89 and 91%.  She also noted using her home nebulizers
every one to two hours over the course of the day.  Because
she was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Room, as [**Hospital6 1129**] was on
diversion unfortunately.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has Addison disease with a
recent admission to [**Hospital6 1129**] as

cancer of nonsmall cell type, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease on home nebulizer, Trousseau syndrome on Fragmin ,
history of malignant melanoma,
asplenia from hemorrhage

[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12056**] at [**Hospital1 2025**].  Phone #:  [**0-0-**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient reported allergies to PENICILLIN,
which causes anaphylaxis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.1, heart rate 120, blood
pressure 100/42, oxygen saturation 99% on 10 liters.
GENERAL:  The patient is tachypneic and anxious.  HEENT:
pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes
dry.  NECK:  There is no JVD, accessory muscle use is noted.
CHEST:  Inspiratory and expiratory wheezing.  HEENT:
Tachycardia.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds times four.
GENITOURINARY:  No CVA tenderness.  EXTREMITIES:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema, positive purpura on legs.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is alert and oriented times three,
otherwise, nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 14.5, hematocrit 33.6, platelet count 45,000,
neutrophils 76, lymphocytes 13, sodium 133, potassium 4.2,
chloride 92, bicarbonate 31, BUN 10, creatinine .5, glucose
94.  ABG on admission 7.35, 53, 265 on 10 liters.  The EKG
showed sinus at 113, normal axis, PR 140, QR 76, QVC 401.
There was a single PVC.  No ST or T changes.

Chest x-ray showed flatten diaphragm, left effusion and mild
upper zone redistribution.

In the ED, the patient had labs drawn, including blood
cultures, stress doses steroids given, and antibiotics for
asplenia.  OxyContin was given for pain and Ativan for
anxiety.  Continuous nebulizers were also administered.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course could be
summarized as follows:  The patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit on [**12-14**] with the admitting
diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
The oxygen saturation was 89% to 91% and she had an increased
requirement for nebulizers.  The MICU course was significant
for the requirement of continuous nebulizers, Solu-Medrol,
Lovenox, but no antibiotics.

On the night of admission, the patient developed left lower
extremity numbness and coldness with inability to Doppler her
pulse below the knee.  The foot was noted to have sensation,
but preserved motor function.  Angiogram showed multiple
occlusion including the superficial femoral artery, anterior
and posterior tibial arteries and peroneal arteries.
Vascular Surgery consultation recommended IV heparin, but no
acute surgical intervention.  The patient is still short of
breath as of [**2115-12-16**], when she was transferred to
the floor, but she was no longer requiring around-the-clock
nebulizers.  She was transferred to the regular medical floor
for further care.

The patient remained on all of her other medications while in
the MICU and on the floor, except for Fragmin, which was
changed to Lovenox while in house.  Protonix was also added
while the patient received high-dose steroids.  She received
IV Solu-Medrol for three days, which was then switched to
Prednisone, which is being tapered off following her
discharge.  The patient's left lower extremity has remained
stable.  The clots have not progressed.  She has good motion
and sensation in her feet, although the dorsalis pedis pulses
is no longer Dopplerable.  The patient has frequently
requested transferred to the [**Hospital6 1129**].
However, the nature of her illness and the likelihood that
the acute event would be resolved quickly, made that option
not favorable to patient care.

The patient's last documented room oxygen saturation was 81%
with supplemental oxygen increasing to 97%.  The patient will
be discharged on [**2115-12-20**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, q.2 to 3h.p.r.n.
3.  OxyContin 20 mg p.o.b.i.d.
4.  Ativan 1 to 2 mg p.o.q.4 to 6h p.r.n.
5.  Florinef .1 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Fragmin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d
8.  AeroBid 4 puffs b.i.d.
9.  Prednisone, which will be tapered off, 50 mg on
[**12-20**] and 12th, 40 mg on the 13th and 14th, 30 on the
15th and the 16th, 20 on the 17th and 18th, and 10 mg on the
19th and thereafter.  The patient will also be on home oxygen
three liters nasal cannula to wear continuously.  The patient
is to also receive physical therapy and walk with a walker.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Lung cancer.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Trousseau syndrome.
4.  Malignant melanoma.
5.  Asplenia.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient should followup with her primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12056**].  The patient would prefer to be
re-admitted to [**Hospital6 1130**] in the future as her primary care is obtained at that
institution.



The patient will followup with her other specialists for care
of her leg and pulmonary condition.
