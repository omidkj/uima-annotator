Pertinent Results:
[**2118-8-19**] Vein Mapping: The right greater saphenous vein is patent
throughout with the caliber of 0.33 to 0.46 in the thigh and
0.30 to 0.37 in the calf. The left greater saphenous vein is
also patent with a caliber ranging from 0.34 to 0.54 in the
thigh and 0.26 to 0.31 in the calf.

[**2118-8-19**] Carotid U/S: 1. No significant carotid artery stenosis
bilaterally. 2. Mild atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid
bulbs and internal carotid arteries bilaterally.

[**2118-8-22**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be
excluded. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal and mid
inferoseptal and inferior wall hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
35-45 %). The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is on an epinephrine infusion. The
patient is now A-paced. Inferoseptal and inferior wall
hypokinesis is still present, though slightly improved from
pre-bypass exam. Estimated EF is 45%. Right ventricular function
is unchanged. Mild aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild aortic
stenosis is unchanged. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta are
intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation.
Upon admission she received medical management and underwent
pre-operative work-up. She was brought to the operating room on
[**8-22**] where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 with
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to distal right
coronary artery/ Full left-sided Maze procedure with a
combination of Atricure bipolar system and the CryoCath with
resection of left atrial appendage.CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME:
115 minutes. CROSS-CLAMP TIME:  95 minutes. Please see operative
report for further surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. She arrived intubated, on propofol, levo, epi and was
a-paced over SB 40's for optimal cardiac function. Sedation was
weaned,she was found to be neurologically intact and extubated
without incident that postop night. Pressors were slow to wean
off as she was acidotic, requiring blood, and epi was
discontinued. Dobutamine was added for continued hemodynamic
support. Betablocker was initially held due to hypotension and
bradycardia. Once pressors and inotropy were weaned off  by
POD#4 Coreg and Digoxin were started. Amiodarone was initiated
for MAZE and post-op rapid a-fib. Mrs[**Last Name (un) 91505**]  heart rate
and hypotension improved. An Ace was added but she became
hypotensive and was discontinued. She continued to progress and
on [**8-26**] she transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of
strength and mobility. Anticoagulation was initiated for
postoperative AFib/MAZE. Gynecology was consulted due to
persistent vaginal discharge. She had initially been consulted
by gyn preop and a dose of Diflucan was given, however the micro
resulted in nonfungal organisms. She was placed on Metronidazole
po x 7 days per gynecology. The remainder of her hospital course
was essentially uneventful. She was cleared for discharge to
[**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 3597**] on POD# 7. All follow up appointments
were advised.
