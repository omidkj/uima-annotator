Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21193**]
Chief Complaint:
headache, left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 yo man who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
admitted to Neurosurgery [**6-14**] for brainstem hemorrhage.  History
dates back to about 4-5 weeks ago when he had sudden onset
dysphagia and odynophagia.  Had an extensive work up at an OSH
as well as here with ENT and ENT eval here showed no an anatomic
process.  According to his daughter, he had multiple head
imaging
studies including MRI which were apparently normal, but was
diagnosed clinically with having had a stroke.  His speech was
slurred mildly from this, but he was easily understandable.
Also, he received a PEG for the dysphagia, but after about [**3-26**]
weeks was starting to take applesauce and oatmeal by mouth.
While at rehab, he developed Atrial Flutter and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of this.  He was discharged to rehab
tuesday, and was doing well.  On friday was found to have
confusion, headache, left hemiparesis and worsened dysarthria.

Was taken to [**Hospital 78777**] hospital where a CT showed a brainstem
hemorrhage with intraventircular spread and blood in occipital
horns as well as question of likely small subdural versus focal
subarachnoid clot in the inter hemispheric fissure anteriorly.
Was transferred here to [**Hospital1 **], where he was following commands,
confused, and had left leg weakness which was [**4-27**].  He had to be
intubated for MRI secondary to confusion and was intubated
yesterday for several hours for the study.  Was noted to be very
sedated yesterday AM and evening, with minimal movement on the
left side, and this has improved significantly as sedation was
washed out.
His daughter at bedside feels that he appears much less sedated
than yesterday and seems to be less confused.  Also seems to be
moving his left side better.

After transfer, repeat head CT showed no acute change.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Opens eyes to loud voice and only maintains for
3-5 seconds before closing again.  Cannot assess orientation
well as he is so profoundly dysarthric, but seems to say no to
options of 'hospita;" and "[**2165**]".  Follows 2 step command with
RUE and only 1 step with LUE.  Dysarthric to point that only
"base-ball" on [**Location (un) 1131**] could be discerned and otherwise cannot
understand
him.  No apparent neglect.  Severely inattentive.
Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm
bilaterally. Can read, but does not blink to threat either side.

Could not tolerate funoscopy.  Extraocular movements intact
bilaterally, no nystagmus. Sensation seems intact V1-V3 but
unreliable.  Facial movement down just slightly left.  Hearing
terrible in left ear at baseline, and hears only loud voice in
right ear today.  Palate elevation asymmetrical with elft
slightly higher than right.  Gag intact but requires significant
stimulus.  trapezius normal bilaterally. Tongue midline,
movements intact

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone paratonic throughout. No observed
myoclonus.  Has significant intention tremor which is improved
from yesterday.  Has asterixis.
Mild left pronator drift

Difficult to assess dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, but at

Sensation: Intact to light touch x 4, could not otherwise
assess.

Reflexes:
Trace [**Hospital1 **]/Tr bilaterally.  Absent BR, Knees and ankles
Toes up left, equivocal right.

Coordination: Could not do FNF due to inattention.

Did not assess gait.

DISCHARGE EXAMINATION:
Pt is globally disoriented. His speech is fluent. Naming of low
frequency objects intact. He has persistently dysarthric speech.
Pt has a tendency to sundown at night, but easily re-directs.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-6-14**] 1:10 PM
1. Hemorrhage within the prepontine cistern and layering within
the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
2. Likely small subdural versus focal subarachnoid clot in the
inter hemispheric fissure anteriorly.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-6-15**] 4:22 AM
Allowing for positional differences, little change is seen
compared to prior study. Hemorrhage again seen in the prepontine
and premedullary cistern, and layering within the occipital
horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally. High-density
material also again seen in the interhemispheric fissure
anteriorly, possibly representing small subdural versus focal
subarachnoid clot. Mass effect from the medulla is not
significantly changed from prior study. There is no shift of
midline structures. The configuration of the ventricles is
little changed from prior. Visualized paranasal sinuses are
normally aerated

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-6-17**] 2:24 PM
Little interval change compared to [**2165-6-15**]. Persistent
hemorrhage within the basal cisterns with intraventricular
extension in both lateral ventricles. Unchanged mild-to-moderate
communicating hydrocephalus.
There is a prominent vascular focus likely related to the left
anterior cerebral artery/ supraclinoid internal carotid artery
(series 2, im 13) and as suggested before pt. would need a CTA
or MRA to assess for aneurysm.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2165-6-15**] 11:25 AM
New ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal
contours are unchanged with cardiac size normal. There is no
pneumothorax. The right lung is grossly clear. Minimal increased
opacity in the left lower lobe is new, likely atelectasis.
Residual contrast material is in the visualized colon. New
ill-defined opacity in the
