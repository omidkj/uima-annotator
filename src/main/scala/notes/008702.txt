Pertinent Results:
[**2133-8-25**]: CXR: Large opacity in the right perihilar region
extending to the lateral hemithorax on the right. Density highly
suggestive of airspace disease although smaller underlying mass
lesion cannot be entirely excluded. A neoplasm is suspect.

[**2133-8-25**]: Liver/ Gallbladder U/S: Cholelithiasis, no evidence
acute cholecystitis. Prominent common bile duct, cannot exclude
distal choledocholithiasis.

[**2133-8-25**]: CT HEAD: No significant interval change with no acute
intracranial pathology identified.

[**2133-8-25**]: CT C-spine: 1. Limited examination due to multilevel
degenerative changes as described above with no definite acute
fracture. The kyphotic angulation results in canal narrowing,
which increases risk of cord injury. If high clinical suspicion,
a dedicated MRI can be used for better evaluation of ligamentous
and cord pathology. 2. Atherosclerotic disease and centrilobular
emphysema.

[**2133-8-26**]: Renal U/S: HISTORY: 85-year-old man with acute renal
failure. Please evaluate for
obstruction.

COMPARISONS: None.

FINDINGS: The aorta is of normal caliber and diameter
throughout. There is
no evidence for aneurysm or focal dilatation. The right kidney
measures 10.4 cm and the left kidney measures 11.3 cm. Within
the right kidney, there are no stones, masses or hydronephrosis.
Within the lower pole of the left kidney, there is a 2.7 x 1.4 x
1.1 cm multiseptated hypoechoic structure likely representing a
multiseptated parapelvic cyst. There are no other masses
identified. There is no hydronephrosis. There is a Foley present
within the bladder, which is decompressed. There is limited
arterial vascular evaluation of the left and right kidneys.
However, waveforms are normal in appearance and there is
normal-appearing flow.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for hydronephrosis.
2. Right-sided parapelvic cyst.
3. Limited evaluation of the renal vasculature, however, flow
appears normal.
4. No abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2133-8-27**] 2:58 PM

[**2133-8-26**]: CT chest without contrast: 1. Large right upper lobe
mass abutting the major fissure, encapsulating and narrowing
right upper lobe airways. Postobstructive pneumonitis is seen
adjacent to the lesion. Several pulmonary nodules are seen in
the superior segment of the right lower lobe, in the right
middle lobe, and left lower lobe. 2. Multiple heterogeneous,
predominantly sclerotic lesions in spine, consistent with
metastatic disease. 3. Hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the
liver, incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast study,
consistent with metastatic disease. Further evaluation with MRI
is recommended.
4. Previously described pancreatic duct abnormalities are not
well evaluated on this study, and MRI is recommended for further
evaluation. 5. Multiple right-sided calcified pleural plaques
and multiple foci of left-sided pleural thickening suggesting
prior asbestos exposure. 6. Mediastinal and hilar
lymphadenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old male with CAD s/p STEMI on [**2133-8-19**] here with
diarrhea x1 day, dizziness, possible acute pancreatitis, and
acute renal failure.

#. Acute renal failure: FeNA 2.8 consistent with ATN. Renal was
consulted and felt this was likely multifactorial from
cholesterol emboli, recent initiation of an ACEI, and volume
depletion. Abdominal ultrasound with renal flow with no evidence
of aortic dissection or obstruction. Urine eosinophils negative.
His creatinine was monitored and should continue to be closely
watched for resolution at rehab.  He maintained good urine
output with 1100 cc in the 24 hrs prior to discharge.  Please
avoid nephrotoxic medications, including ACE-inhibitors for the
time being.  Continue to monitor urine output and ensure patient
does not become dehydrated.  Cr on day of discharge 7.3,  BUN
53,  K 3.6

#. Pancreatitis: Chemical elevation of Lipase and ALT sensitive
and specific for acute pancreatitis though history not typical
with minimal symptoms. [**Last Name (un) 5063**] score approximately 3 at
admission and 0-1 at 48 hours. Given that LFTs are decreasing
and lipase is falling, it appears that the patient likely passed
the obstructing stone. GI (ERCP team) involved initially but
decided against ERCP acutely given his improvement and he was on
Plavix; Consider ERCP in [**7-7**] weeks as an outpatient if desired
by patient/family. Zosyn was started to cover possible
developing biliary sepsis, but there was no sign of this
subsequently. He was eventually resarted on clears. Statin held
given transaminitis.

## bloody stools: The patient started having liquid stools, +
for blood, since starting clears, ?related to PO intake as he
has had a substantial amount of PO fluids over the first 24
hours of clear liquid diet. However, he remained symptom-free,
hemodynamically stable, and with stable Hct (~35). Diarrhea
improved overnight as his diet was restricted again to sips, and
he was restarted on clears again, with no red liquids. He had
another loose bowel movement that was green and guaiac negative
and he reported to me on the day of anticipated discharge that
the diarrhea was slightly improved.  If this continues, you may
consider checking C. difficile.  Hct 34 on day of discharge.
Diarrhea described as green in color, occult blood negative on
the day of discharge.

#. Right lung mass: Given his smoking history, the mass is
concerning for lung cancer. The plan as of his last discharge
was to defer biopsy for one month given that he is on Plavix.
However, given the likely metastatic nature of the disease, it
is unclear what benefit a biopsy might provide as the patient
and his niece are reluctant at this time to consider
chemotherapy.

CT chest during this admission showed a post-obstructive
pneumonitis; given the potential for an infectious component, he
was covered with Zosyn for postobstructive pneumonia for seven
days (ends [**2133-9-2**]). Noncontrast chest
