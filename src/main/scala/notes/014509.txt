IMAGING:
CT Head [**8-17**]:
FINDINGS: There is an acute right-sided parafalcine subdural
hematoma
measuring 7 mm in thickness near the vertex (2:25). More
inferiorly, there is a fluid hematocrit level (2:19), which may
represent hemorrhage into an
arachnoid cyst at this site. Hyperdense material layers along
the superior
aspect of the right posterior tentorium consistent with subdural
hematoma.
There are no other areas of hemorrhage. There is no shift of
midline structures or herniation. The ventricles and sulci
demonstrate mild prominence, likely sequelae of age- related
parenchymal atrophy. There is no acute vascular territorial
infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains well
preserved. Osseous structures are intact. There is a left
parietal vertex subgaleal hematoma (2:28). The partially
visualized paranasal sinuses, ethmoid and mastoid air cells are
clear apart from minimal aerosolized material in the right
sphenoid sinus (3:18).
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute right parafalcine subdural hematoma extending
inferiorly over the
tentorium cerebelli. In the posterior interhemispheric falx,
there is an ovoid focus with discrete margins. Internally, the
is acute hemorrhage layering with CSF attenuation. This raises
suspicion of hemorrhage into a pre-existing arachnoid cyst,
which was present at this site.
2. No midline shift and no herniation. No hydrocephalus.

CT Head [**8-18**]:
FINDINGS: Please note, some of the images were degraded by
motion artifact
and were repeated. There is incomplete improvement upon repeat
acquisition. There is a right parafalcine subdural hematoma,
which measures up to 9.8 mm, slightly smaller than the prior
measurement of 10.8 mm. There is persistent extension over the
tentorium inferiorly, particularly in the right tentorial
aspect. There is unchanged low-attenuation focus in the
posterior aspect of the right parafalcine subdural hematoma
measuring 5.3 x 10.1 mm. Differential considerations remain
unchanged and include potential arachnoid cyst. There are no new
foci of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. There is no mass
effect,
edema or shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and
white matter
differentiation is well preserved. Again is noted a left
posterior occipital scalp hematoma slightly smaller than the
prior examination. There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: Slightly smaller right parafalcine subdural hematoma
layering
along the tentorium inferiorly.

Head CT [**8-19**]:
FINDINGS: Again identified is a right parafalcine subdural
hematoma with a
focal area of hypodensity, minimally smaller in its widest
posterior aspect when compared to prior exam (2a:20), but
overall little changed.
It extends along the right tentorium, unchanged. No new
intracranial
hemorrhage is identified. There is no evidence of edema in the
brain. Mild
prominence of the ventricles and sulci due to cerebral atrophy
is again seen. A small left parietalr scalp hematoma is
decreased in size. The bones are unremarkable. Aerosolized
secretions are again seen in the right sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: Minimal decrease in the widest posterior portion of
the right
parafalcine subdural hematoma, which is largely unchanged, with
unchanged
extension along the right tentorium.

CT C-spine [**8-17**]:
FINDINGS: There is no fracture or dislocation. There are marked
degenerative changes with loss of intervertebral disc height
between C4/C5, C5/C6, and C6/C7 with anterolisthesis of C4 on C5
anterolisthesis of C5 on C6. There are posterior disc osteophyte
complexes at C4/C5 and C5/C6. There is moderate canal narrowing
particularly at C5/C6. There is bilateral facet arthropathy,
most marked at C5/C6. There is no significant prevertebral soft
tissue swelling. The visualized outline of thecal sac appears
normal apart from canal narrowing at C5/C6; however, CT cannot
provide detail comparable to MRI. The partially visualized lung
apices demonstrate scarring with possible septal thickening,
which may indicate volume overload.
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or dislocation. Multilevel degenerative changes
with canal
narrowing, which may predispose to cord injury in the setting of
trauma. If there is concern for neurologic injury, recommend
MRI.
2. Possible mild septal thickening of the lung apices may
represent volume
overload.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2131-8-20**] 8:34 PM
Slight increase in the bibasilar pleural effusions with mild
stable cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary venous congestion. No
consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 89F who resides at an [**Hospital3 **] facility who
is s/p mechanical fall while attempting to get up from her
dining table on [**8-17**].  She was taken to an OSH where an acute
subdural hematoma was identified along the falx with layering
over the right tentorium. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
definitive neurosurgical care.

Her head CT was repeated upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], and found to be
essentially stable. Given her history of being on coumadin for
atrial fibrillation, she was admitted to the ICU for q1h neuro
monitoring and anticoagulation was reversed. Her head CT was
again repeated on [**8-19**], and she was determined to be stable for
transfer out of the ICU to the neurosurgical floor. She also
complained of back pain, so imaging of the spine was obtained
and determined to be without acute process. She was seen and
evaluated by PT and OT who determined she would require
continuous PT/OT treatment in the [**Hospital3 **] facility.
Patient desaturated to 80s and was placed on lasix 20mg [**
