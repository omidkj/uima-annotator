Service:  [**Location (un) **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year old gentleman
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on
home oxygen, atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes, recently
discharged from [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2131-12-12**], status post T3 through T7 laminectomy.
His hospital course was complicated by T4 epidural hematoma
evacuation.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 7558**] for three days at which point the nursing
staff noticed increased secretions as well as decreased
oxygen saturations.  Of note, the patient had been treated
with pneumonia approximately one month prior to this
admission.  Additionally, there was some report that the
patient had decreased p.o. intake at rehabilitation and a
questionable history of Methicillin-sensitive resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient does report a flu shot in
[**2131-11-26**].  He is currently denying any fevers, chills,
nightsweats, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  The patient's
treatment at rehabilitation primarily consisted of nebulizer
treatments with suctioning for the chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease as well as diuresis for probable congestive
heart failure.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was
noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 63/94
associated with hypoxia.  The patient was initially
transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for BiPAP and
for intravenous fluid resuscitation.  At that point the
patient was initially started on Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin as
well as Clindamycin.  After aggressive intravenous fluids
hydration the patient's blood pressure normalized to
approximately 110/48.  His arterial blood gases at the time
was 7.46, 45, 66, after BiPAP 7.48, 44, 115.  The chest x-ray
was consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia.  He was
stabilized over night in Medicine Intensive Care Unit and
transferred to the regular floor for further treatment and
evaluation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient prior to recent surgery was
independent of activities of daily living, however, post
surgery has been quadriplegic.  Currently the patient lives
with his wife, however, he spent time at [**Hospital3 7558**] postoperatively.  The patient is an ex-tobacco
user and quit in [**2093**] with a 35 pack year history.  The
patient reports approximately 2 glasses of alcohol a day.  He
denies any intravenous drug abuse.  He is a retired engineer.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature maximum 99.4,
pulse 74, blood pressure 53/94 after intravenous fluid
resuscitation, increased to 112/60, respiratory rate 32,
oxygen saturation 95% on BiPAP with pressure support of 10
and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.  Generally, the
patient is an elderly cachectic male described as being in
mild to moderate respiratory distress on BiPAP.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Moist mucous membranes.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  No
scleral icterus.  Neck examination, no jugulovenous
distension.  Cardiac examination, normal S1 and S2,
tachycardiac, regular rate.  Pulmonary examination:  Clear to
auscultation anterolaterally with rhonchi in the upper
airways, abdominal examination benign.  Extremity
examination, trace bilateral lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient was able to withdraw from pain.  Sensation intact
in the lower extremities, however, unable to voluntarily move
lower extremities against resistance.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data from admission, white blood
cell count 14.4 with a differential of 91% neutrophils, no
bands, 3% lymphocytes.  Hematocrit 38.9, baseline hematocrit
34 to 36, platelets 126, MCV 101.  Chem-10 remarkable for a
bicarbonate of 35, BUN 26, creatinine 0.7, cardiac enzymes
negative.  Lactate 1.9.  Coagulation studies normal.
Arterial blood gases, 7.46/45/66, on BiPAP 7.48/44/115.
Chest x-ray from admission, right heart border was obscured
secondary to right middle lobe density, left lung base with
opacification, officially read as possible right middle lobe
pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory distress - The patient was
initially transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for
a 24 hour period of time during which he received BiPAP over
night as well as nebulizer treatment and suctioning,
antibiotic treatment was initiated with Clindamycin,
Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone.  The patient was transferred
back to the floor the following day, off of BiPAP saturating
fine on nasal cannula.  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
he persistently mucous plugged, particularly at bedtime while
lying in the supine position, during which time he saturation
would decrease significantly down to 60s or 70s.  The
patient's oxygen saturation improved dramatically post
suctioning, respiratory therapy.  The chest x-rays were
notable for worsening infiltration on both sides, however,
there was no evidence of overt congestive heart failure.  The
patient remained hypoxic on room air with an oxygen
saturation of 80%, however, he was able to be weaned down to
4 liters of nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation greater
than 90% without any evidence of respiratory distress.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient has a history of
pneumonia.  He is status post treatment for Levofloxacin
given the right middle lobe infiltrate.  The patient was
broadly covered with antibiotics, however, during his
hospitalization he had had a right subclavian line placed and
subsequently developed an Methicillin-sensitive resistant
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, one out of four bottles
were positive for Methicillin-sensitive resistant
Staphylococcus aureus with negative seromas cultures.  The
catheter tip was sent, growing gram positive cocci and the
patient was started on Vancomycin therapy.  She will be
discharged with a PICC line with follow up treatment as an
outpatient with Vancomycin.  Additionally, the patient had an
echocardiogram to evaluate for any vegetations.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which revealed no
vegetations.  An ejection fraction of 75 to 80%, the left
ventricle was described as being hyperdynamic.  There was 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.  There were no other obvious wall
motion abnormalities or other valvular abnormalities.  The
patient was treated initially for presumed bacteremia without
evidence of endocarditis or osteomyelitis, however, given his
known back surgery and inability to move his lower
extremities voluntarily, the decision was made to follow up
with his vascular surgeon and obtain an magnetic resonance
imaging scan as an outpatient to evaluate for any suspicious
lesions of the surgical site which would warrant prolonged
antibiotic therapy.

3.  Coronary artery disease - The patient does have a history
of coronary artery disease, however, no recent cardiac
catheterization confirmed that.  The patient did have a
positive troponin while he was in the Medicine Intensive Care
Unit, however, creatinine kinase were flat.  The patient was
maintained on Digoxin for
