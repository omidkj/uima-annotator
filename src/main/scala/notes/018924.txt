                            **FINAL REPORT [**2103-6-26**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2103-6-26**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

         FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in
MCG/ML
