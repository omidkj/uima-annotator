Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 y.o. female with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation and
mechanical aortic valve on coumadin presents from an OSH with
left sided SDH. Patient was at home yesterday, felt off balance,
and fell forwards in the bathroom. She is unsure of LOC during
the fall. She was helped up by her daughter, with whom she
lives, and contined with her regular activities. She felt well
for the remainder of the day and this morning she felt more
"wobbly."
Her daughter felt that she was "off" and when she noticed the
patient was febrile she took her to an OSH. A head CT was
performed that detected a left sided SDH. She was found to be
febrile to 102 and subsequently received 1 dose of rocephin. She
also received 10mg of vitamin K and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
In our ED, her INR was found to be 3.5 and she was also found to
be febrile to 103.4. She has no specific complaints and denies
headache, blurry vision, dizziness, and nausea/vomiting. UA and
CXR in ED negative. She received 10mg SQ Vit K and 3 units FFP
with repeat INR now 1.7. She became mildly dsypneic after so
much volume, but this resolved with her home lasix and
additional 20mg IV lasix. Repeat head CT showed expected
evolution of SDH but no enlargement or increase in shift
(already 5mm). No herniation. Currently reactive pupils and
intact neuro exam except slight L facial droop. On PO and IV
pain meds. Concern for worsening neuro exam this AM, stat HCT,
possible OR.

IMAGING:
CT HEAD [**2104-6-19**] -
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of left acute subdural hematoma resulting
in 6 mm of
left to right midline shift.
2. Periventricular white matter change consistent with chronic
small vessel ischemia.

CT HEAD [**2104-6-20**] -
IMPRESSION: Stable left frontoparietal subdural hematoma with
redistribution of blood products. New left frontal lobe
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Increased mass effect with
increased effacement of sulci, cisterns, and the lateral and
third ventricles, increased shift of midline structures.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo f with PMHx of CHF, Aortic stenosis, CAD and Afib on
coumadin who presented to ED on [**6-19**] after a fall. It was
unknown if she had LOC. She was admitted to the NSURG ICU
because of a left-sided 8 mm subdural hematoma. Her INR was
elevated to 3.5 which was reversed on admission. The patient and
the family declined operative interventions for the SDH, which
NSURG felt was reasonable. She was discharged to floor on NSURG
service and was noted to have worsening lethargy on [**6-20**]; a
repeat Head CT showed a new intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
stable subdural hematoma.  The patient developed hypoxia and was
felt to be in acute diastolic heart failure with an NSTEMI.
Anticoagulation was not indicated given her ICH and so she was
treated with aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control.
The patient was also diuresed with improvement in her
oxygenation.  She was treated empirically for a hospital
acquired pneumonia given her fevers and hypoxia.  Her mental
status continued to decline with at first right sided and then
left sided paralysis.  Neurology was consulted and felt that
these changes were most likely due to her ICH and surrounding
edema.  She was treated with high dose decadaron without much
change in her symptoms.  She was maintained on seizure
prophylaxis and the neurology team did not feel that the patient
was having seizures as an explanation of her somnolence.  The
patient's status continued to decline she developed guaiac
positive stools and likely had a stress ulcerations from the ICH
and steroids.  The family felt that given the patient's poor
prognosis and her very low likelihood of meaningful recovery
that she would want to have comfort focused care.  She passed
away comfortably on [**2104-6-29**] at 7:00pm.
