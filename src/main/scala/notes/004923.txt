Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted pre-operatively on the afternoon of [**10-18**]
for an elective BKA on [**10-19**].  On admission she was examined,
and outside of significant anxiety over the procedure, was found
to have the same exam as when she previously left the hospital.
She was made NPO after midnight for a BKA on [**10-19**] and recieved
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl the night of admission for
preoperative prophylaxis.  On the evening of [**10-18**] she
complained of nausea.  An EKG was done which was unchanged from
baseline.
    At 0400 on [**10-19**] she was found on the floor next to her bed
by the nurses unresponsive.  An immediate code blue was called
with response by medical and surgical house officers.  She was
found to be pulseless and with occasional agonal respirations.
ACLS protocols were initiated and the patient was intubated
without difficulty.  She recieved 2 rounds of chest
compressions, epinephrine, and atropine.  A triple lumen
catheter was placed in the R groin after multiple attempts.
Pulses were regained and a rhythm was reestablished.  She was
transferred to the SICU where she required multiple pressors for
hypotension.  In the SICU a TTE was done which showed severely
depressed left ventricular function but no thrombus.  Over the
course of the next day her CK's rose into the [**Numeric Identifier 961**] and her
Troponin was 4.7 at its peak.
    The patient at that time was noted to be bleeding briskly
from her multiple groin sticks and developing a large hematoma.
Pressure was held and over the course of the day the hematoma
continued to enlarge requiring multiple transfusions of blood
products including pRBCs, platelets and FFP.  She was taken to
the OR for hematoma evacuation.  No active bleeding was seen but
the femoral vessels were not explored.  For details please see
OP note.  After no improvement in her clinical status the family
decided to make the patient CMO on the morning of [**10-20**].  All
pressors were stopped and she passed away shortly after at 11am.
