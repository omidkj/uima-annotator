Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1865**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right subclavian central line placement
Intubation
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient presented to OSH ED yesterday w/neck pain since the
17th. Per the OSH, she was somnolent and found to be acidotic on
ABG; she was then intubated and R triple lumen femoral placed.
Discussion with family per OSH records indicates that she was
found down for an undetermined amount of time.  CXR initially
showed extensive right-sided PNA and the next day (day of
transfer) was notable for left upper lobe infiltrate.  Exam was
notable for fresh track marks.  Pt was treated with vancomycin,
gatifloxicin and Unasyn per OSH ID consult.  Utox + for cocaine
and opiates, BZ. By report, responded to Narcan (awoke).  Head
CT was negative for acute intracranial abnormality. 2 sets of
blood cultures were + for gram + cocci; echo (TTE) negative for
vegetations and EF was 70%.
*
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] per her son's request.  She
was on Levophed and dopamine prior to transfer, and transferred
on dopamine and bicarb gtts.  She received 6 liters of IVFs by
report to resident over the phone.  She has been ordered 1 U
PRBC, but needs to come from Red Cross, so they're trying to get
the blood sent directly here. Her last abg was 7.37/40/287 on AC
500, Peep 8, rr 22, FiO2 100%. She had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test but no
results are available yet.


Past Medical History:
Hepatitis C (liver biopsy in [**2116**] as showing stage III fibrosis)
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia/lymphoma
history of IVDU

sialolithiasis
fine tremor
peripheral neuropathy

[**2119-10-23**] - Echo - The left atrium is normal in size. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small (~1cm) anterior pericardial effusion but
without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

[**2119-10-27**] CXR - 1. Peripheral and basilar predominant interstitial
pattern affecting the right lung to a much greater degree than
the left, in corresponding to more extensive areas of
consolidation on earlier radiograph of [**2119-9-23**]. These
findings may be due to slowly resolving pneumonia, but areas of
interstitial disease from drug toxicity, previously masked by an
overlying pneumonia, is within the differential diagnosis,
particularly if the patient has received bleomycin therapy.
Continued radiographic followup is recommended to assess for
resolution. If persistent, a high-resolution CT may be
considered.  2. Splenomegaly.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**2119-10-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No radiographic evidence of acute, displaced rib fracture. If
symptoms are localized to a specific area, coned-down rib films
with metallic marker may be helpful.
2. Interstitial lung opacities as described above. Please see
recent report [**2119-10-27**] regarding differential diagnosis
and recommendations.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old female with history significant for Hepatitis C, IV
drug use, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia now transferred
from outside hospital with high grade bacteremia, septic shock,
and respiratory failure.
*
1) Respiratory failure:
Her respiratory secondary to a right upper lobe pneumonia. On
transfer, her PaO2 to FiO2 ratio was less than 200, which is
consistent with ARDS.  Therefore, she was switched to pressure
control ventillation to keep her peak pressures less than 30.
At those pressures, she was pulling tidal volumes of about 400
cc.  She was intially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime.  When her blood cultures
grew out strep. pneumonia, noted from the OSH, she was switched
to penicillin. She became febrile on [**10-19**] and [**10-20**]
self-extubated on [**10-20**], and later had to be reintubated on
[**10-21**] due to tachypnea and alkalemia.  She was extubated
successfully on [**10-25**] and weaned without difficulty to nasal
cannula.
switched to vanco on [**10-21**] for positive blood culture (GPC) on
[**10-19**]. The plan is 14 days should finish on [**11-3**]. The pt
remained satting well on room air until discharge.
.
2) Strep Pneumo sepsis:
Initially, the etiology of her gram positive cocci bacteremia
was unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] her history of IV drug use and her fresh
track marks on exam, there was initial supicion for
Endocarditis. However, at the outside hospital, she had a
negative transthoracic echocardiogram for endocarditis. She had
an abdominal ultrasound that was negative for ascites,
therefore, SBP was unlikely the source.  Once her blood cultures
grew out strep. pneumonia, it seemed most likely that her
pneumonia was the source of her bacteremia. On transfer, she was
on dopamine through a femoral line to maintain her blood
pressure. On arrival, she had a subclavian line placed.
Initially, she required 3L of IV boluses to maintain her CVP
above 15 (accounting for PEEP).  She was continued on the
dopamine and vasopressin was added. On hospital day 2, she was
weaned off of the dopamine and maintained on the vasopressin;
however, due to low urine output, she was switched back to the
dopamine and off of the vasopressin.  Her cortisol stimulation
test at the outside hospital showed an appropriate respo
