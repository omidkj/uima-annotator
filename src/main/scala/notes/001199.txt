Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, R sided chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
   75 yo Male with COPD, CHF (EF 55%), Coomb's positive
hemolytic anemia (transfusion dependent), 5Q Syndrome(loss of
long arm of chromosome 5 causing transfusion dependent anemia -
subtype of MDS), remote history of DVT, DM II,  presents with
sudden onset SOB, new orthopnea, R-sided pleurtic chest pain,
and new lower extremity edema.  Pt was transfused one unit [**Unit Number **]
days prior to admission and he had recently stopped prednisone
for coomb's positive hemolytic anemia. Pt denies fever and
chills at home.  Pt was admitted with similar complaints in
[**2122-11-6**] at NEBH. At the time, the BAL cultures were
negative and the patient was treated with abx and steroids.  CT
at time of discharge demonstrated worsening cystic formation.
.
   In the ED, ECG showed ST depressions in leads V4-V6.  The
patient was subsequently started on heparin gtt.  Given CXR
findings of increased perihilar haziness, and R infrahilar
haziness, in conjunction with fever to 100.4 and a lactate of
3.5, he also received azithro 500mg x1, ceftriaxone 1g IV x1,
and Lasix 20mg IV x 1.  After diuresis, the patient subsequently
became hypotensive with decrease in SBP from 130s to 90s.  He
was then given NS 250 cc with some return of SBP to 110s.  The
patient did not receive a CTA to rule out a PE due to the
developing acute renal failure. (No urine output to lasix.)
.
   The patient was evaluated by the MICU resident on night of
admission for respiratory distress.  He was subsequently
intubated due to hypoxia and respiratory distress.  The patient
was subseqeuntly found to have bilateral PEs on CTA consistent
with findings of DVT on LE dopplers.  The patient was not
started on anticoagulation however given the concern for
bleeding with several episodes of hemoptysis.  In addition the
patient also had a presumed aspiration PNA with an as yet
unisolated organism.  He had multiple cystic lesions which were
concerning for infection, super infection or intrinsic lung
disease and multiple bronchoscopy and BAL were unable to
identify neither the infection or the underlying lung disease.
However the patient did improve clinically on vancomycin,
levofloxacin and flagyl.  Although extubation was initially
complicated by persistent secretions and poor spontaneous
breathing trials, the patient was successfully extubated on
[**2123-3-9**].  During his MICU course, the patient also received
several blood transfusions for his Anemia and 5Q syndrome as
well as multiple boluses of fluid to maintain blood pressure.
The patient did well for 24 hours post extubation and was
transferred to the floor hemodynamically stable.

CXR [**2123-2-21**]: "FINDINGS:
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with mild
cardiomegaly and a tortuous and unfolded aorta. There is
increased perihilar haziness. There is also patchy increased
opacity in the right infrahilar region. No definite effusions
are identified. Lung volumes overall are slightly reduced. There
is no pneumothorax. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: 1. Increased perihilar haziness compared to the
prior study may represent early CHF.
2. Increased right infrahilar opacity, concerning for pnemonia
given the history of fever."

Bilateral LE US [**2123-2-22**]:
"The veins of the right lower extremity from the groin to below
the popliteal trifurcation show normal color flow, normal
Doppler with augmentation and normal compressibility. On the
left side, however, the popliteal vein and anterior tibial vein
are distended, noncompressible and partially occluded. The
superficial femoral vein, greater saphenous and common femoral
vein all show normal flow, compressibility, and Doppler wave
forms.
CONCLUSION:
Acute DVT involving the left popliteal and anterior tibial
veins. The remainder of the venous system is fully patent."

TTE [**2123-2-23**]: "Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular  wall motion is normal.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated.
