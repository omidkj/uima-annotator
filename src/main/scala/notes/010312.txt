Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2123-2-24**] and underwent flexible
bronchoscopy at the bedside that same day, which revealed
significant granulation tissue in the left mainstem bronchus
causing occlusion during exhalation.  She also had mild to
moderte granulation tissue in the right mainstem bronchus.

On [**2123-2-25**] she was planned to go to the operating room for
rigid bronchoscopy and debridement; however, ST depressions were
noted on her telemetry tracing and although she did not complain
of symptoms of chest pain or pressure, and she remained
hemodynamically stable, it was thought prudent to cycle her
cardiac enzymes prior to taking her to the operating room.
Troponins x3 were negative (<0.1), and the ST depressions
resolved, likely representing mild demand ischemia and not an
MI.

She was taken to the operating room on [**2123-2-26**] for rigid
bronchoscopy as planned.  Through the working channel of the
flexible bronchoscope, cryotherapy was
performed to the granulation tissue with a reduction in
granulation tissue of approximately 25%. As the majority of the
granulation tissue could not be extracted, it was determined
that the patient should not have her Y stent replaced and allow
the granulation tissue to regress for the next month and be
reevaluated for Y stent replacement. Her 7- 0 Portex
tracheostomy tube was then reinserted and she was
then transferred back to the intensive care unit in stable
condition.

She was discharged to rehab on [**2123-2-27**] in stable condition.
She was on her regular pureed diet and tolerating O2 by nasal
cannula with CPAP as needed.
