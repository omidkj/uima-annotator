Pertinent Results:
[**2112-11-17**] Cardiac Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this
right-dominant system revealed two-vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA had no significant stenoses.  The LAD had a
50-70% stenosis after D1, which itself had a 70% mid-vessel
stenosis.  The distal LAD tapers and had an 80% stenosis.  The
LCX had a widely patent prior stent in a large OM2. The RCA had
severe diffuse proximal and mid-vessel disease up to its
bifurcation.  The RPL and RPDA branches were small and without
significant stenoses, with distal filling via LAD collaterals.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal central
aortic pressures.

[**2112-11-18**] Echo: Off Pump CABG:1. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. 2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. 3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. 4. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. 5. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. 6. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. 7. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. 8. There is no pericardial
effusion. The LV systolic function was preserved at the end of
the case.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he ruled out for acute infarction. Cardiac
cath on [**11-17**] showed severe left anterior descending coronary
disease. Having previously refused surgical intervention
elsewhere, he now consented to surgery. On [**11-18**] he went to the
operating Room where an off pump bypass was performed. See
operative note for details.  He tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Plavix was administered as he was done off pump.
Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and  extubated. On post-op day one he was
transferred to the telemetry floor.

He was admonished to the necessity of taking medications as
prescribed, smoking cessation and compliance with glucose
control.  Beta blockade was resumed and diuresis begun.  Chest
tubes were removed on the first day after surgery. Physical
Therapy was consulted for mobility and strength. Insulin was
begun, both fixed dose and sliding scale, as this had previously
been his regimen when compliant. He was evaluated by the pain
service regarding his pain medication regimen due to his history
polysubstance abuse. The remainder of his post-op course was
uneventful and on post-op day four he appeared suitable for
discharge to rehab with the appropriate medications and
follow-up appointments.
