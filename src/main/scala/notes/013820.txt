The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and free

thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 35 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

place
There is a mean gradient of 26 mm across the valve,the new valve
area is 0.9

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2163-6-27**] where the patient underwent aortic
valve replacement (19mm tissue).  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Cefazolin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to home with VNA services in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
