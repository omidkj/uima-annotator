History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year-old female with a history of ILD who presents
with altered mental status. Per the daughters report she was
suffering from respiratory symptoms for the last 2 weeks with
fever, mild cough and laryngitis. She is on 3 liters O2 at the
NH. She was tx with 1 week of Levo starting [**2137-1-31**] for possible
PNA. Although her respiratory symptoms were improving on monday
she noted her to be significantly fatigued in her nursing home
and less conversational. She required more assistance yesterday
and was dropping objects. Today she was found slumped in her
wheelchair, lethargic but opening her eyes to voice. VS, FS 117,
BP 84/54 R, 87/52 L, P 62, R 12, 100% 3L NC. On review of her
med list it appears lasix 60mg PO was started [**2-15**] and lopressor
25mg PO BID was started on [**2137-2-14**]. It was thought she was
having a CHF exacerbation. Her Chem7 yesterday was Na 140, K4.2,
bicarb 36, BUN 53, Cr 1.6, Ca 8.4.
.
In the ED, Inital VS 97.3, HR 70, BP 98/70, R 18, 100%. FOund to
be hypoglyemic and given D50 with improvement of BG to 189. CT
head negative. Became more arousable and able to answer
questions. EKG showed Aflutter with Ventricular rate in the 60s.
CXR showed BL lower lob markings felt consistent with CHF or
PNA. BNP 2586. In the ED she developed hypotension with SBP to
the 70s but responded to 2L IVF bolus. She was given Levo 750mg
and Vanco 1gm IV. Blood culture was drawn. She was admitted to
the ICU for AMS and recent hypotension. VS prior to transfer
were 96.2 71 97/55, 20, 100% on oxygen. The daughter (HCP) was
called and confirmed full code status while in the ED.
.

nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,

IMAGING:
CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of an acute intracranial process. MRI would be
more sensitive
for an acute infarction, if indicated.
2. Likely retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst in the right posterior
fossa.
.

TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Severe aortic valve stenosis is not
suggested. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-5-21**],
right atrial and right ventricular cavity enlargement with now
identified, with marked right ventricular free wall hypokinesis
and new tricuspid regurgitation.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of an acute
pulonary process (e.g, pulmonary embolism).

LE U/S: IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower
limb.

CXR (admission):
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse chronic bilateral interstitial lung disease (IPF).
2. Prominent hila from prominent pulmonary vessels suggesting
pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Progressive cardiomegaly.

CXR (intubated):
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
supine position. The patient has been now intubated and ETT is
seen to reach the central portion of the right main bronchus. It
should be withdrawn by at least 3 cm so to avoid obstruction of
the left main bronchus. Previously described left internal
jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged
position. An apparently new NG tube reaches only to mid portion
of esophagus. No pneumothorax has been generated. Previously
described extensive bilateral interstitial congestion and
probably edema pattern remains.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old female with history of progressive interstitial lung
disease, presents in respiratory distress, hypotension, and
increased lethargy.
.
#Shock: Patient arrived hypotensive despite extensive IVF
resuscitation and required dopamine via PIV. Multiple etiologies
were in the differential diagnosis.  Septic shock was the most
likely etiology, given her respiratory symptoms prior to
admission,
