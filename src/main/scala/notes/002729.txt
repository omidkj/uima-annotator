Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive urgency and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 39 M with DM, ESRD on HD, gastroparesis, autonomic
dysfunction, CAD (STEMI, NSTEMI), ; was admitted to MICU with
usual nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and hypoxemia of unknown
origin. Mr [**Known firstname 6164**] was recently admitted from [**2103-12-5**] with
concern of line infection/positive blood cultures; started on
vancomycin with HD.
.
Pt. reported sudden onset N/V x4 on day of admission. Emesis was
non-bloody or bilious. No prodorome or associated symptoms,
except slight abdominal pain, no diarrhea, occasional dry cough
x 2+ months.
.
Pt also reports being "high on fluid" as he notes that he senses
that with increased abdominal girth and neck swelling. This
onset of these symptoms could not be clarified by the patient.
He reports being at a party the day before and drinking
cranberry juice and water, but denies use of EtOH, drugs or
dietary indiscretions. This episode is similar in nature to
previous exacerbations of gastroparesis per patient and renal
attending who knows patient well (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**]. Saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(his cardiologist) on day of admission; was feeling ill at the
time. He recommended increasing lisinopril and labetalol, adding
HCTZ and stopping clonidine patch.
.
From ICU admit note: "In the ED, patient received 20 IV
labetalol for elevated BP; 4 mg IV ativan and 2 mg IV dilaudid.
Femoral CVL placed. Initial vitals 97.8, HR 90, 190/120, 97% on
RA. Desatted to upper 80s on RA and ?lower into 70s per ED
signout (but not documented in written notes), ABG with pO2 of
71. Placed on 3 L NC. CXR with volume overload; CTA obtained due
to hypoxemia and was negative for PE. SBP range 170s-180s. In
ICU pt c/o [**9-23**] abdominal pain, asking for dilaudid and ativan,
2 mg of each."
.
While in ICU, patient completed ROMI, CTA and repeat XRs did not
show apparent PNA and he continued to have a 2L O2 requirement.
He was started NPO, abdominal pain and N/V impoved and was then
advanced to clears. Pain was treated with IV dilaudid, IV ativan
and zofran. CTA review revealed a new LAD aneurysm. Pt underwent
HD today where he received Vanco per HD protocol and was deemed
stable enough for transfer to floor.
.
Pt. was seen in HD, NAD, somewhat sleepy s/p Ativan for nausea.
In addition to above, he reported one episode of CP 2 d PTA,
lasting 30seconds, w/o associated symptoms and resolution on its
own. He denied N/V, CP, SOB, diarrhea, fevers, chills, HA,
diplopia.
