Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male who
was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2179-4-15**] for evaluation of a
basilar artery aneurysm.

The patient has a significant history of coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, mitral
valve regurgitation, hypertension, peripheral vascular
disease, and stroke, as well as a history of rectal cancer
(status post resection and colostomy).

The patient was at his Winter home in [**State 108**] when he
experienced two weeks of worsening shortness of breath,
orthopnea, and chest pain.  Because his family lives in
[**Hospital1 3494**], [**State 350**] the patient requested transfer to
[**Hospital6 2561**] for mitral valve surgery.

As part of his presurgical evaluation, the patient underwent
a head computed tomography which was worrisome for fusiform
basilar artery aneurysm which was confirmed by magnetic
resonance angiography to be 1.3 cm X 2.1 cm in diameter
aneurysm.

The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for definitive treatment prior to
mitral valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft and mitral valve disease.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Gout.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Rectal cancer; status post colostomy.
7.  History of burns as a child; he has had bilateral upper
extremity with skin grafting.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Home medications included Zocor,
Elavil, Synthroid, Lasix, potassium chloride, Colace,
lactulose, amiodarone, Protonix, allopurinol, and captopril.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN (which produces a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Hospital1 3494**] with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on
admission revealed the patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  General examination revealed an elderly male in no
apparent distress.  Head and neck examination demonstrated
normocephalic and atraumatic.  The neck was supple with
proptotic eyes.  Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a
regular rate with a systolic murmur.  The lung examination
demonstrated good air movement with bibasilar crackles.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, and nondistended
with a functional colostomy noted in the left lower quadrant.
Extremity examination demonstrated 2 to 3+ edema; right
greater than left.  Pulses were palpable throughout.  Old
burn injuries were noted in both bilateral upper extremities.
The patient was noted to be missing the fifth digit on his
right hand and had a .................... left hand.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2179-4-15**] under the
Neurosurgery Service directed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**].

Shortly following angiography to fully study the extent of
his basilar artery aneurysm on hospital day two, the patient
experienced an episode of acute respiratory distress
requiring emergency reintubation and was subsequently
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on [**2179-4-17**].

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's pulmonary status
was responsive to aggressive diuresis.  The patient was
successfully extubated on [**2179-4-18**] and continued to
demonstrate improving failure signs with aggressive diuresis.
With continued with improvement in his respiratory status,
the patient was able to be transferred back to the regular
floor on [**4-19**] where he remained until the day of his
surgery.

An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained given reports
of a positive catheter tip culture at [**Hospital6 2561**]
which reportedly demonstrated Pseudomonas and Escherichia
coli, as well as a reported recent history of Clostridium
difficile colitis.  Although no evidence of bacteremia was
noted at that time, the patient was prophylactically begun on
perioperative Flagyl for Clostridium difficile prophylaxis
beginning on [**2179-4-19**].

A cardiac catheterization conducted on [**2179-4-22**]
demonstrated elevated left-sided and right-sided filling
pressures and preserved cardiac output.  In addition,
moderate pulmonary hypertension with large V waves and
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing was noted.  40% to
50% serial stenoses in the proximal and medial portions of
the left anterior descending artery were noted.  Nonselective
renal angiography demonstrated only mild bilateral stenosis
(less than 40%).

Following stabilization of the patient's respiratory status,
extensive conversations were held with the patient and his
family with regard to the risks of additional cardiac surgery
given his fusiform basilar artery aneurysm.  Following
extensive discussions surrounding the risks of potential
stroke during the course of his procedure, the patient and
his family agreed to mitral valve replacement on [**4-26**],
and the patient was subsequently scheduled for a mitral valve
replacement on [**2179-4-27**].

On [**4-27**], the patient underwent a right thoracotomy with
mitral valve replacement with a 31 Mosaic porcine valve.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of
100 minutes.  The patient's pericardium was reapproximated.
Lines placed included a right radial arterial line, a right
internal jugular with a Swan-Ganz catheter.  Two atrial wires
were placed and two right pleural tubes were additionally
placed during the course of the procedure.  On transfer to
the Recovery Room, the patient's mean arterial pressure was
60.  His central venous pressure was 12.  His PAD was 28, and
his [**Doctor First Name 1052**] was 36.  The patient was noted to be a normal sinus
rhythm at a rate of 80.  Drips on transfer included Milrinone
and Levophed.

The patient was initially weaned and extubated shortly
following his procedure; however, he required reintubation
for respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation on
postoperative day one.  A follow-up chest x-ray demonstrated
evidence of volume overload with questionable acute
respiratory distress syndrome.

An Infectious Disease consultation obtained at that time
recommended starting the patient on empiric Zosyn coverage in
addition to his standing Flagyl dosage.  Further consultation
with Pulmonary Medicine resulted in continued aggressive
diuresis of the patient with good effect.  Further evaluation
of the patient's chest film demonstrated the presence of
bilateral pleural effusions with increasing evidence of
underlying newly diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis.  Intermittent
temperature spikes resulted in the addition of vancomycin to
the patient's antibiotic regimen with continued aggressive
respiratory care.

A screening transesophageal echocardiogram obtained on [**5-5**] demonstrated no evidence of endocarditis as a potential
source of the patient's elevated temperature.

The patient demonstrated gradual improvement in his
respiratory status with aggressive diuresis and continued
antibiotic therapy through [**5-6**], at which point he was
successfully extubated while in the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Recovery Unit.

Following extubation, an oropharyngeal speech and swallowing
study was obtained which cleared the patient for oral intake
on [**5-6**].

The patient continued to demonstrate an improving clinical
examination and diminishing signs of respiratory distress
through postoperative day 13 ([**5-10**]), at which point he
was transferred to the floor and admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

Extensive review by Physical Therapy recommended the patient
for rehabilitation placement following discharge.

On the floor, the patient continued to demonstrate a
gradually improving clinical examination with continued
aggressive diuresis.  A follow-up chest computed tomography
demonstrated no evidence of a pulmonary infectious process;
however, it did demonstrate evidence of progressive pulmonary
fibrosis; right greater than left.

On postoperative day 17 ([**2179-5-14**]), the patient was being
planned for transfer
