Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. Torn mitral chordae are
present. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname **]
at 10AM before CPB.

POST-BYPASS:
Normal RV systolic function.
Mild global LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 45%)
There is no residual MR>
There is a prosthesis in the mitral position, well seated and
functioning well.
The mean mitral gradient is 2 mm of Hg.
Thoracic aorta is intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2149-5-14**] 14:16

HISTORY: Postoperative cardiac surgery.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-15**], there has been
some clearing
of the left retrocardiac opacification. Bibasilar atelectasis
with small
bilateral effusions persist in this patient with intact midline
sternal
sutures and a prosthetic valve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and taken to the OR on
[**2149-5-14**] for mitral valve repair, MAZE and LAAA ligation. See
operative for details. Post operatively he was taken to the
CVICU intubated, sedated and on amiodarone and propofol drips.
Pt was weaned from the ventilator and extubated on POD#0.
Betablockers and diuresis was started on POD#1. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was in atrial fibrillation and developed conversion pauses
requiring temporary pacing with epicardial wires. A cardiology
consult was obtained. A permanent pacer was indicated at this
time. Betablockers were held then resumed at low dose on POD#4.
Low dose betablocker was tolerated. He converted to NSR.
Coumadin therapy was initiated. Diuresis was ongoing. Chest
tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol. Pt
was evaluated by physical therapy and cleared for discharge to
home on POD#6.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 98327**] his PCP will [**Name9 (PRE) 86284**] his coumadin management-
confirmed with [**Doctor First Name **] from Dr.[**Name (NI) 98328**] office.Target INR
2.0-2.5.
