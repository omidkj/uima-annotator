This discharge summary summarizes the hospital course from
admission of [**1-30**] through transfer from the ICU on
[**2-2**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 46-year-old male
with a history of chronic pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, who
presented with abdominal pain on [**1-29**] and suspected
cholangitis.  CT of his abdomen at that time showed two new
"pseudocysts" and the patient was admitted to the Medical
floor.

On the [**1-30**], he had an ERCP which revealed
spontaneous pus drainage into the duodenum through a fistula
and a 2 cm stricture of the common bile duct.  His old
plastic biliary stent was changed and Surgery was consulted,
but he was felt not to be a surgical candidate at that time
because of ongoing alcohol abuse and the fact that the
abscess at the pancreatic head had spontaneously necessitated
into the duodenum.

On the floor, the patient had increasing symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal, more abdominal pain, and increasing oxygen
requirement.  Chest x-ray done upon transfer to the ICU
demonstrated bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and because of
worsening hypoxia secondary to bilateral infiltrates, the
patient was transferred to the Fenard ICU for further
management with a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis, induced
acute respiratory distress syndrome.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse; status post
ERCP with common bile duct biliary stent in [**2130-5-9**]
status post biliary stent change in [**2130-6-8**], status post
biliary stent change in [**11-11**] secondary to repeated stent
migration.  In [**2130-5-9**], his ERCP was complicated by
hemorrhage and status post embolization of his gastroduodenal
artery.
2. Status post secondary to pancreatic insufficiency.
3. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
4. Recalcitrant alcohol abuse.
5. Depression and anxiety.
6. Status post correction for duplicated renal collecting
duct.

ALLERGIES:  Naprosyn, ibuprofen, and Ativan.

aneurysm.

claims to drink 10-12 beers a day.  He has a history of
delirium tremens.

VITAL SIGNS:  His temperature is 100.2.  His heart rate was
114.  His blood pressure is 152/78 and he was 96% on 100%
nonrebreather.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he was confused,
disoriented, slightly agitated.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  His jugular venous pressure was flat and
his mucous membranes were dry.  His heart was tachycardic,
S1, S2.  His lungs anterolateral showed decreased breath
sounds throughout.  His abdomen was soft, slightly tender in
epigastrium, though bowel sounds were not present.
Extremities were without edema.

LABORATORIES:  White count at that time was 13.8, hematocrit
was 32.2, platelets were 212.  Sodium was 136, potassium 3.6,
chloride 97, bicarb 28, BUN 6, creatinine 0.5, albumin was
3.4, PT was 11.8.  ABG showed 7.42, pCO2 of 43, pO2 of 76 on
6 liters shovel mask.

Chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates,
which had developed from [**1-29**].  MRCP showed common
bile duct artifact likely secondary to stent, mildly enlarged
kidneys with hydronephrosis.

One out of eight blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in
pairs and chains from [**1-30**].

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Pancreatitis:  The patient was maintained on ampicillin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl for a period of 11 days.  He did
well with regards to his pancreatitis and he is followed by
the Hepatobiliary and ERCP service.  There were no further
events of this pancreatitis nor his abscess.

2. Mental status:  The patient was largely confused
throughout the hospitalization.  Because of his heavy alcohol
use, he was maintained on standing benzodiazepines through
[**2-6**] at which time benzodiazepines were
discontinued.  He was seen by the Psychiatry service, who
recommended discontinuing benzodiazepines and narcotics and
use Haldol prn.  Overtime he cleared such that by time of
transfer to the floor on [**1-14**], he was mentating,
slightly confused.

3. Infectious disease:  Patient was continued on ampicillin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl for his peripancreatic abscess.  On
[**2-8**], he was noted to have a fever spike.  Patient was
evaluated with CAT scan of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis,
which revealed no changes in his pancreas, however, a dense
right lower lobe infiltrate.  Antibiotics were changed to
Vancomycin and ceftazidime for nosocomial pneumonia.  Patient
defervesced.  Antibiotics were discontinued on [**2-13**].
Patient remained afebrile.

4. Pulmonary:  Patient had two episodes of intubation during
this hospitalization, the second intubation on [**2-9**] to
allow adequate sedation for CAT scan.  He was extubated
without problem.

Patient was discharged to the floor on [**2-13**] for
further management.
