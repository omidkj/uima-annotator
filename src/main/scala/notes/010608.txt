Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LAD instent restenosis treated with cypher stent


History of Present Illness:
49 year old male with HIV (last CD4 183 in [**2161-2-18**], VL < 50 in
[**12-24**]), and STEMI in [**2-25**] complicated by
anteroseptal/anteroapical akinesis with EF 35%, as well as DVT
and influenza infection while in the hospital, who presents from
home with fever, cough, and exertional chest pain.
.
The patient states that for the last 2-3 days he has been
experiencing a cough productive of thick sputum. Of note, he
says his 4 teenagers recently all had strep throat. He had some
sore throat as well but that has resolved. He hasn't taken his
temperature but has felt warm.
.
What prompted him to come in was chest tightness across his
precordium while ambulating, that did resolve with rest. It felt
similar to the pain with his MI, though less severe. It radiated
to the left arm, is associated with shortness of [**Date Range 1440**]. He
denies lightheadedness, palpitations, or association with
breathing. Of note, he has been admitted for a similar pain
shortly after his MI at which time a p-MIBI demonstrated a
moderate partially reversible perfusion defect involving the
apex and mid and distal anterior wall, as well as a moderate
fixed perfusion defect involving the mid and distal anteroseptal
wall, which were both thought to be a result from his recent MI
and not ongoing ischemia.
.
On arrival to the ED vitals were 101.9, 78, 106/60, 14, 96% on
room air. He had a chest x-ray that was unremarkable. He
underwent CTA which was negative for PE or dissection, but did
demonstrate subtle changes in the right lung base consistent
with bronchopneumonia. EKG on arrival was unchanged from prior,
with evidence of an old anteroseptal MI. While in the ED,
however, he developed recurrent chest pain in the setting of
tachycardia, now with more prominent ST depressions in the
lateral precordial leads. He was given nitroglycerin and
metoprolol 5 mg IV. He also received morphine 4 mg. Subsequently
his blood pressure was noted to drop to the 80s systolic. He
received 3 liters of IVF, but blood pressure remained low, so
sepsis protocol was initiated: He had a right IJ precept
catheter placed. ScvO2 81%, CVP 11. Norepinephrine was
initiated. He also received levofloxacin and metronidazole x 1
after blood cultures were drawn.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient says he still has about
[**2164-2-22**] level chest tightness, but otherwise feels comfortable.
He denies any melena, though has occasional mild hematochezia
from his hemorrhoids. Denies hematuria. Denies lower extremity
edema.


Past Medical History:

1) STEMI in [**1-25**] with overlapping bare metal stents to the LAD
for a 90% ostial occlusion.
2) Congestive heart failure, with EF 35%, with anterior wall,
septal, and apical akinesis post-MI in [**2-25**].
3) HIV, last CD4 183, VL < 50 in [**12-24**], on [**Date Range 2775**], managed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
4) DVT in the right common femoral and popliteal vein in [**2-25**],
during admission for STEMI, on coumadin.
5) Hypereosinophilia
6) Hemorrhoids
7) Influenza during [**2-25**] hospitalization for STEMI


Social History:
He denies any alcohol, tobacco or drugs. He is
separated from his wife. [**Name (NI) **] has two children ages 6 and 10, who
are well. He works in banquets. He has lived in [**Location 86**] for
approximately six to seven years and he arrived in the U.S. in

a Haitian mother.


Family History:

diabetes.


Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 100.3, 97, 94/38, 23, 97% on 3L NC. CVP 9.

GENERAL: Well nourished African American male resting
comfortably in bed.
HEENT: Moist mucous membranes. Anicteric sclerae. Tonsils
non-erythematous, without exudate.
NECK: No lymphadenopathy. Right IJ catheter in place. No JVD.
COR: RR, normal rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS: Coarse upper airway sounds that make it difficult to
auscultate true lower airways.
ABDOMEN: Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, no [**Doctor Last Name **]
sign.
EXTR: No edema. Pneumoboots in place.
LYMPH NODES: No anterior or posterior cervical nodes, no
supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinial nodes


Pertinent Results:
CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mucus impaction in distal right lower lobe airways with
peripheral ground glass opacity most suggestive of an infectious
etiology.
2. Mild bronchiectasis with peribronchial thickening.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism
.
CT [**5-31**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions
with consolidation/atelectasis in both lower lobes
.
CCATH:
COMMENTS:
1. Instent restenosis of proximal LAD
2. Successful PCI/stent to proximal LAD instent restenosis with
a
2.5x28mm Cypher stent deployed at 17 atms. Excellent result with
normal
flow down vessel and no residual stenosis.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI/stent to proximal LAD in-stent restenosis with
a drug
eluting stent.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 y/o man w/HIV and recent STEMI w/ 2 BMS to his LAD presented
the ED with a pneumonia. He had hypotension and spent several
days in the ICU, not intubated, but on pressors. His hypotension
resovled, but he developed an NSTEMI. He was transfered to the
floor and monitored. His CKs were initially trending down, but
began trending up again and he was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service for cardiac cath. He was continued on a heparin drip in
preparation for cath as well as for treatment of his DVT. Cath
showed in-stent restenosis of LAD lesion and a drug-eluting
stent was placed. The patient was discharged on Lovenox bridge
to coumadin for prior known DVT. He was discharged with cardiac
rehab and PCP follow up, to complete a 10 day levoquin course.
He was continued on [**Hospital Unit Name 2775**] throughout his hospital course and
further HIV care will be managed by his PCP.
