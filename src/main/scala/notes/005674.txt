.
TTE:
IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with hyperdynamic LV systolic
function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal systolic
function and right ventricular hypertrophy. At least mild aortic
stenosis. Severely calcified mitral annulus. Moderate to severe
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

.
ERCP:
Impression: ERCP with cholangiogram revealed 1cm stone in
mid/distal CBD with upstream biliary dilation.
Because of the patient's critical illness, the decision was made
not to attempt sphincterotomy/sphincteroplasty for stone
extraction.
Successful placement of 5cmx10F double-pigtail biliary stent for
biliary drainage.

Recommendations: Repeat ERCP in [**2-25**] weeks for stent removal and
stone extraction.
Continue antibiotics for 10 days.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Sepsis / Gram Negative Bactermia / Hyperbilirubinemia /
biliary stone: Remained hemodynamically stable on Zosyn and
Cipro. ERCP was performed, stent was placed as detailed in the
studies above, and there were no complications. Pain was well
controlled pre- and post-procedure with Dilaudid prn.
.
# ARF: Creatine was elevated on admission to 1.9; IVF
rehydration was administered.
.
# Elevated troponin: OSH records have conflicting data.
Cardiologist suggests EF 70%, Intensivist reports EF 20%.
Cardiac enzymes were WNL. Echo was performed and EF was found to
be preserved.
.
# AFIB: One two episodes of RVR during admission exam. Lopressor
was held in the setting of sepsis with discharge instructions to
restart the day after discharge, [**7-1**].
