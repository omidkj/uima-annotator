Pertinent Results:
[**12-24**] MRA RIGHT LE:
.
[**2146-12-14**] CXR: INDICATION:  Feeding tube placement. Feeding tube
has been advanced into the body of the stomach.  Tracheostomy
tube remains in standard position.  Bilateral poorly defined
alveolar opacities in the upper and mid lung regions show slight
interval improvement compared to the recent radiograph.
.
[**2146-12-12**] CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: 1.  Multifocal bilateral
ground-glass opacities with peribronchovascular and subpleural
distribution.  In the setting of fevers, this may be due to a
diffuse infection, but other etiologies including cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia should be
considered as well.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is also possible in
the appropriate clinical setting. 2.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions. 3.  Incompletely imaged low attenuation left lobe
hepatic lesion for which ultrasound may be considered for more
complete assessment if warranted clinically.
.
[**2146-12-2**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: 1.  Acute comminuted and depressed
fracture of the squamosal left temporal bone with associated
temporal contusion, as described. 2.  No other intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage, significant mass effect, or shift of the
midline structures. 3.  Inflammatory changes involving the
paranasal sinuses.
.
[**2146-12-2**] CT LOW EXT: IMPRESSION: 1.  Comminuted impacted fracture
of proximal tibia involving medial and lateral tibial plateau.
2.  Fibular head fracture. 3.  Comminuted distal tibial fracture
involving medial malleolus and tibial plafond. 4.  Comminuted
distal fibular fracture.
5.  Fracture dislocation of talus. 6.  Fractures of cuboid and
fourth metatarsal.

obvious right tib/fib fractures.
.
[**2146-12-2**]
Patient to OR with ortho trauma team for the following:
1. Irrigation and debridement of open foot and ankle wound
2. Debridement of open fractures of the fibula, talus and distal
tibia
3. Closed reduction of proximal tibia fracture
4. External fixation of the proximal tibia and ankle fractures.

fasciotomy of right lower extremity.
.
[**2146-12-6**]
Patient to OR with trauma for closure of fasciotomy wounds in
right lower leg; adjustment of external fixator around the
plateau fracture; debridement of open fracture to bone, and
application of black sponge vacuum dressing to right dorsal foot
wound.  No complications during the procedures and pt tolerated
it well.  Transferred back to the TSICU post-operatively on
ventilator support.
.
[**2146-12-9**]
Patient to OR for tracheostomy with trauma team secondary to
