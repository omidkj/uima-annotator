HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 48-year-old woman with primary
pulmonary hypertension who awoke on the day of admission with
a fever of 101.6 accompanied with aches, chills which mildly
improved upon taking Tylenol.  When the patient became more
symptomatic however, the patient came to the Emergency Room.
She did not have any localizing complaints except a
generalized whole body achiness as well as flu-like symptoms.

She denies shortness of breath, cough, sputum production.
She denies dysuria, increased frequency, or urgency.  She
denies any neck pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, or upper respiratory tract like symptoms.  She
denies any sick contacts and has not eaten any suspicious
foods.  She has not taken any new medications.  She denies
any joint pains or rash.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Primary pulmonary hypertension:  The patient has been
taking Flolan which is a continuous prostacyclin infusion for
the past 2.5 years ([**11/2118**]).  The patient says that she has
not had any history of line infection and sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
who is on medical leave currently.  The patient's baseline
blood pressure is 80-110.  She says she only gets shortness
of breath with exertion.  She is also on Coumadin and sees
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology for her primary pulmonary
hypertension as well.
2. History of supraventricular tachycardia/ventricular
tachycardia:  The patient sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and has had
three ablations done in the past.  The patient is currently
on amiodarone for management of her arrhythmias.
3. Glaucoma.
4. Status post appendectomy.
5. Status post cesarean section.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Coumadin 2.5 mg po q day except half a tablet on Thursday
and Sunday.
2. Prostacyclin 18 ng/kg/min.
3. Multivitamin.
4. Claritin.
5. Cosopt one drop OS [**Hospital1 **].
6. Xylatan one drop OS q hs.

ALLERGIES:  Vancomycin causes an itchiness/redness at the
head and neck.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of a myocardial infarction at
age 53.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married and has two children.
She lives at home.  She denies any alcohol, or tobacco, or
drug use.  She manages her Flolan infusion on her own.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Patient is a thin woman in
no acute distress.  Temperature is 99.3 F, blood pressure
80/40, heart rate 105, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation
97% on room air.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  No
scleral icterus.  Oropharynx clear.  Skin:  No peripheral
embolic signs, or rash, or splinter hemorrhages.  Chest:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally with faint fine and
inspiratory crackles.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm with S1 and variable splitting S2, systolic murmur,
visible carotid pulsations were present to the ear.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic:
Grossly intact.

LABORATORIES:  White count 6.6 with a differential of 77
neutrophils, 18 bands, 4 lymphocytes, hematocrit of 41.3,
platelets of 141,000.  PT of 23, INR of 3.7.  Sodium of 139,
potassium 38, chloride 105, bicarb of 22, BUN of 11,
creatinine of 1.0, glucose of 107.  Urinalysis was negative.
A TSH 3.3, free T4 1.2, ALT 13, AST of 16, total bilirubin of
0.7.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia, prominent main
pulmonary arteries consistent with primary pulmonary
hypertension.  No pleural effusions.  Blood cultures and
urine cultures were drawn in the Emergency Room.  In the
Emergency Room the patient also received linezolid x1 dose.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Infectious Disease:  The patient has [**3-17**] positive blood
cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the source of which
was likely to be from the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] line for the
patient's Flolan infusion.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] line was
removed and the catheter tip culture was positive for
Pseudomonas.

The patient was started immediately on intravenous
ceftazidime and Tobramycin.  A left subclavian line was
placed on [**2121-9-13**].  The patient also had a further
Infectious Disease workup to identify the source of
bacteremia including a transthoracic echocardiogram and a
transesophageal echocardiogram which showed no evidence of
vegetations, but increased pulmonary artery pressures with
new bidirectional flow across the patent foramen ovale.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed because the patient
complained of some lower abdominal pain which was negative, a
urinalysis and urine culture were negative, and a renal
ultrasound was also found to be negative.

On [**2121-9-12**], the patient became progressively more
hypoxic and complained of severe right sided pleuritic chest
pain with oxygen desaturation into 79%, which subsequently
increased to 100% on 100% nonrebreather.  A chest CTA was
performed to look for evidence of pulmonary emboli, which was
negative, but did show evidence of a right lower lobe
consolidation with effusion, as well as suspected early
cavitation which was thought to be secondary from the
patient's Pseudomonal bacteremia.

On repeat chest CT scan done on [**2121-9-22**], there was
a persistence of the right lower lobe consolidation with
effusion as well as an increased fluid density opacity within
the right lower lobe which was thought secondary to entrapped
fluid or early abscess formation.  The patient had an
ultrasound guided diagnostic thoracentesis performed on
[**2121-9-23**], which revealed an exudative fluid,
representative of an uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion.

The pleural fluid Gram stain was negative for any organisms
or white cells, however, the fluid culture was positive for
rare bacterial growth.  It was thought however, that the
effusion was still uncomplicated and that the Tobramycin with
ceftazidime antibiotic treatment, the pneumonia and effusion
would resolve after a three week course.

On [**2121-9-25**], a PICC line was placed for outpatient
antibiotic and Flolan treatment, and the subclavian line was
removed and the tip was sent for culture.  The patient is to
continue a full three-week course of Tobramycin and
ceftazidime and if the patient remained afebrile and has no
symptoms of infection after stopping the antibiotics for at
least one week, the patient will be able to have a permanent
central line placed for her continuous Flolan infusion.

2. Pulmonary:  As noted, the patient became progressively
more hypoxic during her hospital course with right sided
severe pleuritic chest pain.  As noted again, the chest CTA
performed at that time revealed no evidence of pulmonary
emboli, but did show right lower lobe pneumonic consolidation
and effusion secondary to septic emboli.  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2121-9-12**] for her worsening hypoxia.  The patient was initially
placed on nonrebreather mask ventilation, and then required
BiPAP.

Because the patient's hypoxia did not improve, elective
intubation occurred on [**2121-9-15**].  The patient was
extubated on [**2121-9-19**] and developed post-extubation
stridor which was successfully treated with a brief course of
steroids.  The patient was transferred out of the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2121-9-23**].  Her breathing
improved remarkably and the patient no longer required oxygen
upon transfer out of the MICU.  Her oxygen saturation
remained excellent at 97-99% postextubation.  Additionally, a
repeat chest x-ray which was performed on [**2121-9-25**]
showed an improving right lower lobe consolidation.

It terms of the patient's pulmonary hypertension, the patient
was continued on her Flolan infusion during her entire
hospital stay.  The patient had her Coumadin stopped while in
the hospital, and the plan is to restart the patient's
Coumadin for her primary pulmonary hypertension once the
permanent tunnel catheter is placed approximately two weeks
after discharge.  The pati
