Brief Hospital Course:
1.UGI Bleed:  Pt was placed on IV protonix and an octreotide
drip.  An EGD [**7-3**] demonstrated 3 large bleeding esophageal
varices, which were banded with good hemostasis achieved. Give
IV ceftriaxone for ppx against SBP.  HCT is steadily dropped to
26 and remained stable with serial Hct.  Given 1u pRBC before
discharge.  Liver team is following and will have repeat EGD.

2. R Foot Ulcer: necrotic appearing ulcer was debrided by
[**Month/Day (4) **] on [**7-3**]. [**Month/Day (4) **] has low suspicion for underlying
osteomyelitis.  Xray did not demonstrate signs of osteo.

3. ARF: Pt presented with Cr 1.5.  ARF was likely prerenal from
fluid loss.  With aggressive hydration Cr improved to near
baseline of 1.1.

4. HTN: all outpt meds were originally placed on hold while the
patient was actively bleeding.  Pt was discharged on Naldol,
Lasix, and Spironolactone.

5. DM: Glucose controlled on lantus 20 [**Hospital1 **] with RISS.

6. Hepatocellular CA: Pt had completed Avastin RX on [**6-20**] as
part 1 of chemo protocol. Due to start gemcitabine/oxaliplatin
this week however treatment will be delayed because of bleed.
Followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
