History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 year old man from [**Country 2784**] h/o HTN who
had a headache last night, took aspirin and went to bed. The
patient came into the ER after seizing, vomiting. He required
intubation because he could not protect his airway. The patient
was withdrawing all extremities to pain according to the ER
resident. Currently the patient is on propofol. Neurosurgery was
called because there was a large IVH seen on CT scan.

No acute cervical fracture or dislocation. No significant
prevertebral soft
tissue swelling. Small posterior osteophyte at C5/C6.


Final Report
HISTORY: 60-year-old man with hypertension, presenting with
acute loss of
consciousness with headache and questionable seizure. Possible
fall but no
signs of acute trauma. Evaluate for possible cervical spine
fracture.

TECHNIQUE: Helical MDCT images were acquired from the skull base
to the
cervicothoracic junction. Multiplanar reformatted images were
acquired.

COMPARISON: No comparison is available.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute cervical fracture or
subluxation.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The normal
cervical lordosis is preserved. There is normal atlanto-axial
alignment. There are multilevel chronic degenerative changes,
most prominent at C5-6 with posterior osteophyte, causing mild
spinal canal stenosis.

In the visualized lung apices, there are mild paraseptal
emphysematous changes and bilateral dependent atelectasis. There
are an endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube. There is
secretion pooling in the dependent position of the posterior
pharynx.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cervical fracture or subluxation.

2. Prominent posterior osteophytosis at level C5/C6, which
increases risk of spinal cord injury even in minor trauma.
Recommend MRI if clinically
concerned for cord trauma.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2192-12-6**]



OBJECT: EVALUATE FOR BRAIN ACTIVITY. THIS IS A DIGITAL EEG
MONITORING
WITH EKG AND VIDEO [**12-5**] - [**2192-12-6**]. THERE WERE NO PUSHBUTTON
ACTIVATIONS.
ROUTINE SAMPLING AND SPIKE AND SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS WERE
UTILIZED.


REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] L. [**Doctor Last Name **]


FINDINGS:
ROUTINE SAMPLINGS: Showed a general suppression of the
background with
bursts of either generalized or left or right activity seen with
a
frequency of between 8 and 12 seconds. There were no
epileptiform
features seen.
SLEEP: There were no normal sleep features seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed occasional sharp and slow wave
complexes in the left frontal region.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 12 entries in this file.
Showed
no epielptiform features.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations in
this
file.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no ongoing seizure activity.
The
background activity was suggestive of a burst-suppression
pattern and
occasional sharp and slow wave complexes were seen in the left
frontal
region.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   r/o DVT



Final Report
HISTORY: 60-year-old male. Rule out DVT.

COMPARISON: None available.

FINDINGS: Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging of the left
internal
jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, and brachial veins was
performed. The right subclavian vein was interrogated for
comparison purposes. There is a dampened waveform appreciated in
the left subclavian vein compared to the right, suggestive of
central obstruction. In the remainder of the vessels; however,
there is normal flow, compressibility, and augmentation. There
is no intraluminal thrombus identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Nonvisualization of the left internal jugular vein. This
could be
secondary to prior occlusion or aplasia.

2. Dampened waveforms in the left subclavian vein compared to
the right. This of uncertain clinical significance. If there is
clinical concern for an SVC syndrome, further evaluation with
MRV could be considered.

3. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis in the left upper
extremity.

These findings were communicated to the referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
