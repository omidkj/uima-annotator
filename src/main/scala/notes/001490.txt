Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Aortic root to right atrial fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein isolation: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2181-8-8**]

History of Present Illness:
This 57 year old man has a long standing history of atrial
arrhythmias s/p flutter ablation, PVI in [**2178-6-16**] and again in
[**2179-9-16**], and multiple cardioversions. He has been most
recently managed on Amiodarone. He was last here at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2181-7-17**] when he complained of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue for
several weeks. He underwent successful cardioversion and had his
Coumadin switched to Pradaxa due to difficulty maintaining
adequate INR levels. Plans were made for repeat attempt at
ablation in [**Month (only) **]. He developed recurrent atrial tachycardia
shortly following his cardio version on [**7-26**]. He underwent
successful DCCV of atrial tachycardia on [**8-2**] with prompt return
to sinus rhythm.
.
Today, pt had planned repeat PVI attempt with CH, but 2nd
transeptal went to aortic root above NCC. Case stopped. TEE
color flow Doppler revealed small fistula between the right
atrium and aortic root with L to R flow. 1U platelets ordered
but not yet given. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**], MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Surgery consulted
and will patient shortly. Patient was left intubated and sent to
CCU for repeat TEE ~1500 to re-evaluate fistula in hopes that it
will have closed. Last Pradaxa [**2181-8-7**] AM dose.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain.

Please note that patient is intubated at time of admission and
therefore details of history are obtained from his electronic
medical record.

Post-Procedure Initial TEE [**2181-8-8**]:
A mobile 0.3 x 0.3 cm structure consistent with probable
thrombus (or other small mass) is seen in the the left atrium
attached to left atrial wall to the left and posterior to the
aortic root . A trans-septal catheter is seen and following
withdrawal there is residual left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum. Left ventricular global systolic function is
normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is an echodense region along the posterior border of the
aorta, adjacent to the non-coronary cusp consistent with a
hemotoma that measures 1.8 cm at the widest. There is a 2mm wide
jet of color Doppler flow through the hematoma from the aortic
root into the right atrium. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Aortic root to right atrial communication with
associated hematoma. Small left atrial mass as described above.

.
Repeat TEE [**2181-8-9**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A small, approximately 1 x 3 mm
mobile structure consistent with possible thrombus is seen
attached to the wall of the left atrium (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]), although
independent motion is not appreciated. Right atrial appendage
ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There is an
echodense region along the posterior border of the aorta,
adjacent to the non-coronary cusp consistent with a hematoma
that measures 2.3 cm at the widest. There is a 3-5mm wide jet of
color Doppler flow from the aortic root into the right atrium.
[clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Aortic root to right atrial communication with
associated hematoma. Very small left atrial mass suggestive of
thrombus as described above.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-8-8**] the
color Doppler jet appears slightly wider and is now continous
throughout the cardiac cycle. The left atrial mass is smaller in
size. The previously appreciated interatrial shunt is no longer
appreciated.

Repeat TTE [**8-13**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20
cm/s). A left-to-right color flow signal is seen across the
interatrial septum at rest across the mid-interatrial septum
consistent with a small secundum atrial septal defect. Overall
left ventricular syst
