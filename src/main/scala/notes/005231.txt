Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 year old male with DMII, Hep C, CABG, numerous sepsis
admissions p/w sepsis, UTI, possible PNA, CP/NSTEMI and severe
anemia likely secondary to a lower GI Bleed.
.
# Sepsis - Mr [**Known lastname 65215**] presented in sepsis.  He refused central
line placement in the ED.  Due to his known h/o infection with
multi-drug resistant gram negative rods and his h/o MRSA, he was
covered broadly with meropenem and linezolid (vanc allergy), the
linezolid was discontinued after cultures revealed only E. coli.
 [**1-17**] admission blood cultures were + for coag negative
staphylococcus and Urine culture was posititve for ecoli
(sensitive to meropenem and sulfa).  He was treated with
aggresive fluid recussitation (with many units blood and FFP)
and his BP improved.  He did not need pressors.  He has been AF
x 1 d.
.
# GI Bleed - Mr [**Last Name (Titles) 65337**] Hct was 16 on admission with guiac +
stool, INR 12; PEG flush in the ED was negative but later was +
for coffee ground return.  GI was consulted but did not want to
intervene in the setting of acute illness.  He was made NPO; 2
lg bore IVs were placed, he was given 6 U FFP in the ED with
reversal of INR to 2; 10mg SQ vitamin K, 1 U platelets (due to
concern over plt dysfx due to ASA use); he received 7U pRBCs in
all with a stable Hct for 36 hrs.  He has had no further
hematochezia or melena.  His diet has now been advanced to tube
feeds.
.
#CHF: Mr [**Known lastname 65215**] became acutely hypoxic/SOB after all the blood
product tranfusions;  CXR revealed pulm edema.  He has been
improving with lasix IV.  Goal diuresis is 500-1L/day.
.
# non-ST-elevation MI/CAD/elevated troponin - likely demand
ischemia related to low Hct. Cardiology did look at the EKG and
recommended holding beta-blockers given septic picture. ASA
given, Statin was continued.  Beta blocker was held [**1-17**]
hypotension.  beta blocker was readded after resolution of
hypotension.
.
# FEN/Hypernatremia - NPO for on admit given bleed. restarted
tube feeds today.  Pt became very hypernatremic to 157 after
admission; free water flushes were increased to 300cc q 4 and
his last Na was 150
.
# Proph - PPI [**Hospital1 **], pneumoboots
.
# h/o DVT/PE - on fondaparinux on last admission. Given
bleeding, will hold and use pneumoboots.
.
# Hypernatremia - free water through g tube: increased to 300cc
q4hrs after Na of 157.
