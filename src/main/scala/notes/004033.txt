epigastric discomfort and nausea and dizziness w/o vomiting

EtOH or smoking hx. She reported a hx of chronic anemia for
which she sees a hematologist but has not had guaic neg stool

vitals were T 98.0 HR 94 BP 119/49 O2 sat 100% and had an hct 19

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Antral ulcer- EGD was performed which revealed a large antral
ulcer with epi and malignancy was suspected but it was not
bx'ed. CEA=3.50 and Abd CT obtained for CA workup. She received
2 more units prbc's post EGD despite hemodynamic stability and
hgb 9.4 hct 27.8, and she was started on a protonix gtt. Pt was
then transferred to the floor on her 3rd hospital day, with
stable hematocrits.  She had a repeat EGD whice showed a healing
ulcer, gastritis and possible varicies.  She was continued on
protonix 40IV [**Hospital1 **] for ulcer. Currently on [**Hospital1 **] po.  Pt typed and
crossed and started on maintenance IVF with [**Hospital1 **] hct checks which
was normal.  H.pylori serologies negative. Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 1158**] Tray is the
pt's outpt doctor, and he assumed care of the patient while in
house.  The record of her OSH abd CT read were significant for
hepatic and renal cysts, normal spleen, scattered para-aortic
adenopathy, small amount of ascities and emphysematous changes
in bilateral lung bases.

2. Renal:  Pt with [**First Name (STitle) 18048**] with liver involvement.  Her baseline
creatinine is 1.4, and she came in at 1.6 which elevated to 1.9.
 She improved with some fluids, so her ARF was likely secondary
to prerenal azotemia.  No hematuria.  Renal was consulted and
suggested optimal BP control, of crucial importance in the care
of [**Name (NI) 18048**] pt's.  We added clonidine and held ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] becuase of
her pre-renal azotemia.  She will f/u with renal as an outpt.

3. Cardiovascular:  Pt was continued on metoprolol for hx of SVT
(details not known).  Metoprolol was switched to the non-cardiac
selective beta blocker nadolol 40mg po QD for potential
decompression of portal system (pt found to have varicies on
EGD).  No arrhythmias while in house.  For hypertension, the pt
was continued on HCTZ.  Renal suggested clonidine and not
ACE-I/[**Last Name (un) **] in lieu of slight renal failure.  She was placed on
clonidine TTS once a week.

4. Pulmonary-CXR with atelectasis. Sats remained stable.  She
was recommended ambulation and treated with incentive
spirometry.

5. Pancytopenia:  Pt with wbc 2.2 and plts 80-100's.  A
reasonable explanation for her anemia was GI blood loss,
however, a component of possible marrow failure is suggested by
the two other low level blood lines.  She has had a negative BM
in the past (specifics unknown).  She may have a myelodisplastic
syndrome vs non-malignanct aplastic anemia.  Her normal MCV does
not rule out MDS.  She should have an outpt BM biopsy for this.
She will be referred to H/O clinic for this ([**2184-11-16**] at 1445 on
[**Hospital Ward Name 23**] [**Location (un) **] with Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2539**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 27819**].  The
patient also has an oncologist she has been seeing for over one
year whom she may also f/u with.

5. FEN-Pt was placed on IVF while NPO.  Her diet was advanced
from NPO to clears to full liquids, finally to solids by the
last hospital day.  The pt did have a non-gap acidosis
attributed to diarrhea (blood being a cathartic).  This [**Female First Name (un) **]
resolved by time of discharge.
