History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 yo woman c MMP including morbid obesity, chronic
resp failure on home O2 Fio2 35 %, ESRD on HD, bedridden.  Pt
was sent from [**Hospital1 11851**] NH today for fever and altered mental
status. Pt had been hallucinating and lethargic for the last 2
days .  Pt c/o left flank pain which started last night and
worsening SOB.
.
In ED found to be febrile up to 101.4, HR 70- 80 BP 71/56
----160/61 after NS boluses and neo drip.ABG 7.22/48/132  At OSH
a fem A-line was placed, and in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] a L subclavian

.
[**2183-4-14**] AXR: This study is extremely limited secondary to
positioning and body habitus. From what can be visualized of the
abdomen there is increased density seen over the right
hemipelvis which may represent oral contrast versus bony
abnormality of the right pelvis. Contrast appears to be within
the rectum/sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. There are no grossly dilated loops of
small bowel.
.
[**2183-4-14**] Abdominal ultrasound: Survey scans of the upper abdomen
show normal-appearing liver and normal forward flow in the
portal venous system.
The right kidney is seen to be rather small and atrophic. There
is no ascites noted.
Targeted scans of the left lower quadrant in the region of the
pannus demonstrate diffuse cellulitis, but no walled-off fluid
collections. A spot was marked for aspiration for purposes of
culture but no drainable abscess was identified.
CONCLUSION: Findings are consistent with panniculitis with
extensive edema in the left-sided pannus but no evidence of
walled-off fluid collection or abscess.
.
[**2183-4-14**] CXR: Bilateral lung opacities predominantly at lower lung
fields, which are concerning for pneumonia. A PA and lateral
radiograph would be helpful for more complete assessment, when
the patient's condition permits. Similar findings have been seen
on prior radiographs. Although possibly due to recurrent
aspiration pneumonia, a more chronic process such as
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma cannot be excluded. If infectious
symptoms are absent, or, if this fails to resolve following
antibiotics, CT would be recommended.
Right central venous catheter whose tip is not well visualized.
No pneumothorax is seen.
.
[**2183-4-15**] CT of abdomen/pelvis: 1. Bilateral lower lobe
consolidation.
2. Diffuse subcutaneous tissue edema.
3. Gastric lipoma and numerous small bowel lipomas.
4. No intra-abdominal abscess identified.
5. The patient's fat pannus is incompletely imaged and the
apparent fluid collection seen on the ultrasound exam performed
on the same day is not well visualized on this study.
6. Enhancement in segment IV of the liver along the falciform
ligament with multiple chest wall collaterals is concerning for
SVC obstruction. This could be further evaluated with
contrast-enhanced chest CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo woman c MMP including morbid obesity, chronic resp failure
on home O2 Fio2 35 %, ESRD on HD, bedridden present c fever,
hypotension and worsening hypoxemia.
.
#  Septic shock due to unclear etiology: Pt was given aggressive
IVF initially given sepsis and started on phenylephrine gtt.
Source of infection included the tunneled dialysis line vs.
panniculitis vs. PNA.  She had  an area of redness and
fluctuance in the LLQ of her pannus that showed a small fluid
collection in the ED.  Surgery aspirated small contents and sent
the swab for culture.  She was started on broad antibiotics.
Given her sepsis concern for line infection was high aswell and
patient needed to have the dialysis line removed.  However she
was hypotensive and on a pressor and attempts to place a
temporary dialysis line were unsuccessful.  She continued to
become progressively more hypotensive requiring additional
pressures.  Given concern for intraabdominal infectin she
underwent CT scan.  GIven her body habitus her full pannus was
not visualized in the CT scanner, however there were no obvious
source of infection in the intrabdominal cavity.  Given her
increased pressor requirement family was called and after
discussion with brother goals of care were changed.
.
#Respiratory failure: Pt had bilateral infiltrates on CxR.
Unclear if she had PNA vs. fluid overload.  She was given fluids
as part of her sepsis management.  She was initially on trach
collar but given worsening hyposemia she was placed on
ventilator for assistance.
.
#Renal failure (acute on chronic):  Patient with metabolic
acidosis and hyperkalemia on admission.  She was total volume up
and disucssion was initiated with renal regarding CVVH as she
was still on a pressor.  Renal service recommended dialysis
however her only dialysis access was the previous line where
there was concern for infection.  Attempts to place new
temprorary dialysis catheter were unsuccessful.  Given her
worsening sepsis and hemodynamic status further aggressive
measures to obtain access were deferred.  Hyperkalemia treated
with insulin/glucose and improved from 6.1 to 4.0.
.
# FEN: Pt on gettting IV fluids. NPO initially.
# Prophylaxis: PPI , sc Heparin, pneumaboots.
# Communication:  Health care proxy [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **] was in close
communication thruout patient's stay.  She was made DNR
initially and given her worsening clinical status goals of care
changed to comfort measures only.  Patient was taken off
pressors and expired quickly.

Medications on Admission:
