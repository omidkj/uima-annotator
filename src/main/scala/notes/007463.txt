History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36881**] is a 70 y/o M with DM2, CVA, mental retardation,
parkinsonism, asthma, OSA on cpap, recently admitted for
nosocomial pna, readmitted soon after discharge from his NH
after desaturating there. He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) **]
after presenting with three days of cough that developed into
respiratory distress and mental status changes. On that
admission, the team started vancomycin and
piperacillin-tazobactam for healthcare associated pna; he was
treated with aggressive pulmonary hygiene, including frequent
suctioning, chest PT, scheduled nebulizers, and guaifenisen. His
course was notable for improving though ongoing chronic
hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Shortly after returning to [**Location (un) **]
Manor, he apparently became febrile to 100.5, tachy to 104,
tachypneic to the mid-30's, and desaturated to the 70's. He was
brought to the emergency deparmtent, where he was found to be
satting in low-mid 80's on 3L nc, so a NRB was applied, with a
rebound in sats to the mid 90's. For hypoxemia, he had a CTA
showing no PE, chronic RLL collapse, and improving
consolidation. He was febrile to 100.5, and cx's were drawn.
When seen on arrival to ICU, he said he was feeling better and
that his breathing was more comfortable. His only other
complaint was of some diarrhea over the past few days.

Brief Hospital Course:
70m with DM2, CVA, mental retardation, Parkinsonism, asthma,
OSA, recent admit for pneumonia who returns shortly after
discharge with fever, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia.
.
# Fever and hypoxemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 36882**] CXR and CTA appear
improved compared to the imaging from his prior hospitalization
which showed pneumonia. He was initially sent to the MICU for
close monitoring given his hypoxemia and need for a NRB. In the
MICU, the patient improved quickly with minimal intervention and
it was thought that he had mucous plugging which accounted for
the rapid improvement in his oxygenation. Other possible causes
for his hypoxemia were bronchospasm or an aspiration event
leading to pneumonitis. He was continued on vancomycin for
coverage of MRSA and completed a 10 day course on [**2198-6-19**]. Given
his eosinophilia (thought to be [**2-16**] to drug), his Zosyn was
changed to levofloxacin. He was also started on flagyl given
concern for aspiration pneumonia and diarrhea, with concern for
possible C diff. He was also treated with advair, guaifenesin,
chest PT, and scheduled nebulizer treatments (both albuterol and
atrovent). He was weaned down from a NRB to nasal cannula. He
was transferred to the general medical floor on [**2198-6-17**] and
continued to do well. We continued to wean his oxygen
requirement down to 4L, with a goal of keeping his O2 sats
89-92% so as to prevent hypercapnea. His BiPAP continued to be
held as it was felt that it could be contributing to his mucus
plugging. He underwent regular suctioning for his secretions,
but by time of discharge, his secretions were much improved. He
was discharged to an acute care facility, with the goal of
aggressive chest and pulmonary physical therapy. He will
complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin and flagyl at rehab (6
days remaining).
.
# Eosinophilia: On admission, he had an eosinophilia of 11%.
Within 24 hrs, his eosinophil count dropped to 1%. It was felt
that his eosinophilia was likely due to a drug reaction, with
zosyn being the most likely cause. Zosyn was changed to
levofloxacin and flagyl with good effect. He remained afebrile
on this regimen.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC was 9.4 on admission, but rose to 11.1 on
the day of discharge. He was afebrile and had no localizing
symptoms of infection. His other hematology labs were also
elevated from baseline and it was felt to be a sign of volume
contraction in the setting of mild dehydration (as his BUN was
also slightly elevated from baseline). He was encouraged to take
adequate PO fluids. No changes were made to his antibiotics.
.
# OSA: He has a history of OSA and is supposed to be on CPAP at
home. However, it was attempted during his last hospitalization
and was felt to be contributing to his hypercapnea. The CPAP was
discontinued and his pCO2 and oxygen sats remained stable. His
CPAP continued to be held during this hospitalization. The
patient should follow up with his PCP regarding the need for a
repeat sleep study to insure that he is on the correct CPAP
settings at home.
.
# Diarrhea: He also complained of diarrhea on admission. He was
started on flagyl empirically for aspiration pneumonia, but also
with the idea that it would cover possible C diff. However, he
did not have any stool samples to send for culture and thus was
never evaluated for C diff.
.
# DM2: He was continued on his outpatient dose of metformin and
ISS. His fingersticks were checked QID and remained within good
range while on this regimen.
.
# FEN: He was kept on a cardiac diet. Given the concern for
possible aspiration pneumonitis, he underwent a speech and
swallow evaluation. Bedside evaluation was unable to be
completed, but the video swallow exam showed no evidence of
aspiration. It was recommended that he continue on a regular
texture PO diet and PO meds. He did not require IVF. His
electrolytes were checked regularly and were repleted prn.
.
# PPx: He was given heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis; PPI for GI
prophylaxis; and bowel regimen was held given ? of diarrhea. He
may need a bowel regimen initiated if he does not have a bowel
movement within 24 hrs.
.
# Access: PICC line.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
.
# Dispo: He was seen by PT who felt that rehab would be best for
the patient, with a focus on acute pulmonary rehab. He was able
to ambulate without becoming dyspneic.
