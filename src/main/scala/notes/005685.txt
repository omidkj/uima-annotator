Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]

altered mental status

History of Present Illness:
Hepatologist:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**]
PCP:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman with h/o Hepatitic C Cirrhosis with
portal hypertension s/p TIPS, MELD score 23, who presented to an
OSH with altered mental status.
.
Her father found her on the morning of admission with her legs
hanging over the side of the bed.  She was unresponsive.  The
family reports that she had been feeling well at home but
becoming increasingly confused.  They admit that she often
fights against taking lactulose, though they feel she is largely
compliant with it.  She may have spit out her lactulose dose
last night.  Otherwise, ROS significant for some nausea.  She
has nevertheless been eating and drinking well.  No diarrhea.
No fevers.
.
When EMS arrived, her blood sugar was 146.  She was noted to be
incontinent of urine.
.
Upon arrival to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital3 6783**], her VS were 129/60   117   21
98% RA.  She was intubated because of failure to protect her
airway.  Although the lowest recorded temp was 96.2 rectally,
she was noted as being hypothermic and a bair hugger was placed.
 Labs were notable for K of 6.2 and non-gap acidosis with HCO3
of 14.  Lactate was elevated at 5.6.  WBC elevated at 16 with
Hct and Cr at baseline.  UA significant for large leukocytes and
negative nitrites.  CT Head without contrast revealed vague area
of low attenuation in the lft frontal region, ? related to small
vessel ischemia.  There was no evidence of bleed, mass, or
midline shift.  CXR revealed vascular congestion.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, she was intubated.  Further history
was obtained via phone call through the patient's son.
.
ROS:  unable to obtain

[**2185-11-16**] CT Head without constrast:  No acute intracranial
process
.
[**2185-11-16**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] and Brain without contrast:  Limited study due
to motion artifact. No contrast was administered due to the
patient's inability to further cooperate and the marginal renal
status. There is no evidence of infarction. The MRA demonstrates
a dominant and patent right vertebral artery with a tiny, but
apparently patent left vertebral artery, and patent internal
carotid arteries bilaterally. The remainder of the study,
although limited, demonstrates no evidence of hemorrhage or
other abnormalities.
.
[**2185-11-17**] CT abd and pelvis w/o contrast: 1. No evidence of
hemoperitoneum or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Cirrhotic liver, with signs for portal hypertension with a
large amount of ascites.
3. Consolidation within the lower lobes of the lungs
bilaterally, most likely represents atelectasis. However,
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Anasarca.
.
[**2185-11-22**] Liver, gallbladder u/s: 1. Patent TIPS with abnormally
high velocities within the mid and distal aspects of the shunt,
similar to the previous exam. Findings remain compatible with
TIPS malfunction.
2. Limited evaluation of the left and anterior right portal vein
although
suggestion of abnormal directionality of flow within the left
portal vein
is compatible with shunt dysfunction.
3. Cirrhotic liver with moderate-to-severe perihepatic ascites
and
cholelithiasis.
.
[**2185-11-24**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen
on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2185-10-27**], no major change is evident.
.
IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman who presented w/ altered mental
status in the setting of Hep C cirrhosis.

# Altered Mental Status: Given her hx of hep C cirrhosis and
recent TIPs procedure, her AMS was thought to be most likely due
to hepatic encephalopathyy. She was reported to have a hx of
poor compliance with lactulose at home.  Of note, she has not
had other episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.
Head CT at OSH was negativ
