4.  Type 2 diabetes.
5.  History of congestive failure.
6.  Ejection fraction 20%.
7.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
8.  Frequent recurrent UTIs.
9.  The patient is status post AICD in [**2167**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  98, 88, irregular, 140/82, 18.  The patient's
general appearance is awake, appropriate, in mild distress.
HEENT:  Examination was unremarkable.  There were no carotid
bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Examination was
unremarkable.  Extremity:  Right lower extremity mottled from
knee to foot with diminished sensation and diminished motor
function of the right foot.  Pulse examination shows palpable
femorals bilaterally.  Pulses on the right are absent distal
to the femoral pulse.  On the left he has a palpable
popliteal and Dopplerable signal triphasic DP and PT.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data included the following:
CBC, white count 8.4, hematocrit 45.7, platelet count
210,000, PT 17.4, INR 2.1, PTT 26.5, BUN 39, creatinine 1.9.

The Department of Cardiology was requested to see the patient
for emergent risk assessment.  They thought he was at a high
risk for perioperative cardiac event.  But, given the
emergency of the situation, no further intervention,
cardiacwise, will be done at this time and recommended beta
blockers and close EKG and serial enzymes monitoring
postoperatively.

The patient had a right subclavian line place.  Heparin was
started.  The patient was taken to the operating suite on an
emergent basis and underwent a right femoral embolectomy.
The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory
stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was transferred to the PACU with palpable
popliteal pulse and Dopplerable DP and PT at the ankle.

Immediately, postoperatively, he was hemodynamically stable
with blood pressure of 139/65, oxygen saturation on three
liters 97%.  Foot examination showed good capillary refill
with a Dopplerable AT and palpable popliteal pulse.
Dressings were clean, dry and intact.  Motor and sensory
examination were intact.  Postoperative hematocrit was 44.8,
INR 2.2, BUN 39, creatinine 1.9, potassium 6.4, recheck 5.3.
Initial CK was 550,000.  MB and troponin levels were pending.
The patient continued to do well.  The patient was
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.

Post chest x-ray for right IJ placement was satisfactory.

On postoperative day #1, there were no overnight events.  The
patient was hemodynamically stable.  The pulse examination
remained unchanged.  IV fluids were hep locked.  The patient
was begun on POs and diuresed, but maintained in the VICU for
the following day.  Preoperative medications were
reinstituted.  The patient did not have significantly
elevated total CPKs, but MB fraction and troponin levels were
flat.  The patient was begun on anticoagulation.  Central
line was removed.  The patient was transferred to the regular
nursing floor on postoperative day #2.  The patient was
evaluated by the Department of Physical Therapy.  The
remaining hospital course was unremarkable.  The patient was
seen by the Department of Physical Therapy.  They thought
that he was a good rehabilitation candidate and would benefit
from [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.  Screening was begun.  The
patient requested [**Hospital1 1319**] or [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]
Hospital.  The patient was discharged in stable condition.
The wounds were clean, dry, and intact.  The patient had a
functioning leg with a Dopplerable DP and PT on the right.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 10 mg q.d. goal INR 2.5 to 3.5.
2.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
3.  Lisinopril 10 mg PO q.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
5.  Lopressor 25 mg.
6.  Aspirin q.d. 325 mg.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acutely ischemic right leg and foot
secondary to embolus, status post embolectomy.
