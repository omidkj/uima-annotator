[**2158-2-15**]:
LMCA 80% ostial
LAD 80% ostial, 95% proximal, 70% mid occlusion
LCX one major OM patent
RCA 100% ostial
SVG single proximal aortic anastomosis [**1-18**] aortic calcification
with bifurcating graft to RCA occluded and limb to LAD with two
serial "ugly" thrombotic lesions
LIMA - not utilized during surgery [**1-18**] small vessel

LVEDP 44 mm Hg
PA 52/22
CO 4.59
CI 2.20
RA 10
RVEDP 15

In the cath lab, the patient received Integrillin, 40 mg IV
lasix, plavix, and 1/2NS.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84 year old male with a history of CAD s/p
CABG (SVG->RCA, LAD), CHF EF 20%, HTN s/p AAA repair,
significant tobacco history and HL, and chronic renal
insufficiency (baseline Cr unknown) who presented on [**2158-2-13**]
with NSTEMI with peak troponin of 9.18 now s/p cath with DES to
LAD and LMCA

The patient was continued on aspirin, plavix 75 mg x 9 months
post PCI, Integrillin 18 hours post cath, and simvastatin 40 mg.
His Atenolol 50 mg QD was changed to Lopressor 50 mg TID with
good effect. The patient's BP remained well-controlled on
Lopressor 50 mg TID. An ACE would be beneficial for cardiac
remodeling, however, given his rising creatinine, an ACE was not
initiated at this time.

Patient has history of CHF with EF of 20%.The patient appeared
overloaded on presentation. He is not on an ACE. We gave him
another 40 mg IV lasix x 1 on transfer to the CCU, he received
40 mg IV lasix in the cath lab and was transferred from [**Location (un) **]
on Lasix 40 mg IV BID. He takes lasix 40 mg QD x 3 days (per
patient) and HCTZ 50 mg x 4 days (per patient) at home for the
past 2 weeks. He diuresed well to Lasix 80 mg IV and then
stablized on lasix 40 mg QD.

His baseline creatinine is unknown, it was  1.6 (1.5 at OSH)on
presentation. It rose to 2.2 with aggressive diuresis.

He was doing well post cardiac catheterization until the early
morning of [**2158-2-20**]. He suddenly went into ventricular
fibrillation. Code was called and was fully ran. He was
defibrillated 10 times with no restoration of regular pulse.
Patient was intubated. He also recieved epinephrine, atropine,
magnesium and calcium when central access was established.
Echocardiogram was performed at the bedside and no pericardial
effusion was found. The code was ran for about 30 minutes.
Family member and the attending were called. Family member
denied post mortem.
