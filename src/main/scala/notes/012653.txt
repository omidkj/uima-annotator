Admission Date:  [**2153-5-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2153-5-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2081-12-22**]     Sex:  F

Service:  O-Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old right-
handed woman who had an episode of loss of consciousness at a
restaurant.  The patient was noted to have a probable generalized
tonic-clonic seizure.  The patient was taken to an outside
hospital, where she was intubated and loaded with Dilantin.  The
patient underwent a head CT scan which disclosed a large left
frontoparietal subdural hematoma with mass effect and midline
shift.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**], where she underwent emergent left craniotomy and
evacuation.  The patient was found to have subdural mass.
Pathology found the mass to be consistent with central nervous
system lymphoma.

On [**2153-5-23**], the patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy.  The
biopsy was negative for lymphoma.  Postoperatively, the patient
was noted to have ST segment depressions in V3 through V6 and
troponin elevated to 1.4.  The patient was also noted to have
electrocardiographic changes which were thought to be related to
rate related ST segment depression with digoxin effect.

The patient was seen by cardiology and her digoxin was
discontinued.  The patient was started on a beta blocker and an
echocardiogram was done.  The echocardiogram disclosed a normal
left ventricular ejection fraction, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation
and 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient was transferred to
the oncology service for initiation of high-dose methotrexate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Asthma.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa drugs.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin and digoxin; on transfer,
the patient was on Decadron 4 mg q.d., lansoprazole 15 mg
q.d., Dilantin 100 mg t.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.,
salmeterol one to two puffs b.i.d., regular insulin sliding
scale, albuterol inhaler p.r.n.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a second cousin with Wilson's
disease and a sister with breast cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient was a
pleasant female lying in bed in no acute distress.  Vital signs:
Temperature 100.4, blood pressure 120/60, heart rate 80,
respiratory rate 20.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Left
craniotomy scar, moist mucous membranes, oropharynx clear, pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
extraocular movements intact.  Neck:  Supple, no jugular venous
distention.  Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular, S1 and S2, no
murmur, rub or gallop, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the apex
radiating to the axilla.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds. Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times 3, cranial
nerves II through XII intact, exam otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer, white blood cell count was 17,
hematocrit 30.6, platelet count 190,000, BUN 11, and creatinine
0.6.

RADIOLOGIC DATA:  MRI from [**2153-5-18**] disclosed an enhancing
left frontal extra-axial mass with mass effect, intracerebral
edema in the left frontal lobe.  CT scan of the torso from [**2153-5-21**] showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or masses within
the chest, abdomen or pelvis.  Echocardiogram from [**2153-5-21**]
showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, mild
dilatation of the left and right atria, 1 to 2+ mitral
regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, no pericardial
effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Events while on the neurosurgical service
were reviewed above.  Hospital course while on the oncology
service will be reviewed below.

(1)  Oncology:  The patient underwent initiation of chemotherapy
with high-dose methotrexate.  She underwent a lumbar puncture to
evaluate for the possibility of carcinomatous meningitis.  The
patient was continued on steroids.

(2) Seizure prophylaxis:  The patient was continued on Dilantin
and was maintained on seizure precautions.

(3) Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was continued on a beta
blocker for rate control.  Anticoagulation was held given her
recent neurosurgery.

(4) Asthma:  The patient was continued on her inhalers.

(5) Gastrointestinal:  The patient was continued on lansoprazole
and a bowel regimen.

(6) Endocrine:  The patient was maintained on a regular insulin
sliding scale.

(7)  Renal:  The patient was well hydrated during the
administration of methotrexate due to the fact that methotrexate
can precipitate in renal tubules.  Urine pH and methotrexate
levels were monitored.

(8)  Skin:  The patient was noted to have zoster neuralgia.
She was given Capsacin cream.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was instructed to follow up with
neurosurgery for placement of an Ommaya shunt so that she may
undergo intrathecal chemotherapy.  We will also follow up
cerebrospinal fluid cytology.  The patient is to follow up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Capsacin cream.
Salmeterol inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Dilantin 100 mg p.o.t.i.d.
Decadron 4 mg p.o.b.i.d.
