Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105647**] arrived in the hospital after a fall in the shower.
He came to the ED, where he was diagnosed with a R hip fracture.
He came to CC7 for medical clearance, and was cleared by the
team. He then went for an ORIF of his right hip on [**2178-6-21**] to
the Orthopedic Team.  He tolerated the procedure well, and was
taken to PACU where he was hypotensive and required pressors.
He stayed in the PACU overnight, and was transferred to the SICU
through the next day.  He was transferred to the floor after
close monitoring, and blood pressure stabilization.

The rest of his hospital stay was unremarkable.  He was given 1
unit of PRBC on [**2178-6-21**] for a low hematocrit, and it bumped
appropriately. Physical therapy worked with the patient, and
felt, along with the physician staff, that the patient would
benefit from rehab.
