Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemic respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
CVL placement
Flexible bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old gentleman with a past medical history
significant for COPD, colon CA s/p resection, AF with RVR, and a
recent admission for hypoxemic respiratory distress who presents
with fever, dyspnea, and non-productive cough now transferred to
the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory distress. The pateint reports
a 1 day history of fever to 102, non-productive cough, and
progressively worsening dyspnea for which he presented via EMS
to an OSH ED. At that time, per report, he had an SaO2 of 33%RA
improved to 75% NRB. At the OSH ED, he was placed on NIPPV with
improvement in symptoms. He had a CXR that demonstrated diffuse
bilateral infiltrates, and he received vancomycin and pip/tazo.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED at the request of his
family.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 30835**] for
hypoxemic respiratory distress. At that time, symptoms were felt
to be due to CHF and pneumonia, and the patient was diuresed
aggressively and treated with vancomycin and cefepime with
hospital course complicated by hemoptysis with MTB ruled out
with 3 negative induced sputums and AF with RVR.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 100.3 76 90/56 20 95%NRB.
Labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 17.1 with a neutrophil
predominance and INR >4, and the patient was then admitted to
the MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient states that his dyspnea is improved from
earlier today. Denies any CP, n/v/d, abd pain, palpitations.

Past Medical History:
1. Colon cancer stage II (T3N0M0), status post right
hemicolectomy in [**2152**].
2. History of TB treated in [**Location (un) 6847**] - apparently 2 years on
antibiotics and a few more months for prophylaxis.
3. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia in [**2154**] discovered by VATS
biopsy.
4. Hypertension.
5. Cataracts status post bilateral surgery.
6. Eczema.
7. Atrial fibrillation: s/p DCCV [**2161-2-3**]
8. CHF: LVEF [**12-10**] 50%
9. DM 2

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] lives in [**Hospital1 392**] and he came from [**Location (un) 6847**] about 10
years ago.  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] used to be a truck
drive. He continues to use alcohol occasionally.  He is a former
tobacco user, smoked 1 pack per day for approximately 40 years
and he quit in [**2141**].  He denies exposure to asbestos and denies
any exposure to any animals or birds.

Family History:
His family history is notable for mother who had hypertension,
father who died of unknown cause, brother who died of head
trauma, and an older brother who is a smoker who has lung
cancer. He does have a daughter with breast cancer.

Imaging:
CT chest [**5-6**]
Marked interval improvement of generalized infiltrative
pulmonary abnormality, seen also in fluctuation over the course
of this admission on chest radiography, suggesting that the
changes are in large part due to the status of pulmonary edema.
Persistent bilateral lower lobe interstitial thickening on a
background of moderately severe emphysema is not typical of
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, etiologies such as viral
pneumonia and drug toxicity are considered more likely.
.
US [**5-9**]
1. Abnormal gallbladder, with distention, wall thickening, and
copious sludge concerning for acalculous cholecystitis.
2. Numerous echogenic foci with ring-down artifact in the
gallbladder wall, compatible with adenomyomatosis.
3. Mid aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3.9 cm, minimally
enlarged from prior CT.

BAL path: Alveolar macrophages, abundant acute infalmmation.
Negative for malignant cells.
