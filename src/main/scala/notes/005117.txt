[**2175-11-19**] Chest CTA : 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
associated atelectasis, possible small superimposed
consolidation.
  2. No segmental or larger pulmonary embolus seen.

[**2175-11-22**] UGI :
  There is no evidence of obstruction, leak or fistula at the
esophagojejunostomy anastomosis site.

[**2175-11-26**] CT Chest/abd/pelvis : 1. Interval development since
[**2175-11-19**] of multifocal airspace consolidation, most compatible
with multifocal pneumonia, but possibly early ARDS.
  2. Subacute eccentrically located subsegmental pulmonary
embolism involving the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe,
that can be seen in retrospect on [**2175-11-10**] with
ischemia/infarction of pulmonary parenchyma on [**2175-11-19**], now
mostly resolved.
  3. Small anastomotic leak in the region of surgical drain left
of the blind limb of the esophagojejunostomy.
  4. Enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, up to 1.5 cm in short
axis.

[**2175-11-26**] CT guided drainage of abdominal abcess : Successful
CT-guided drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess left of the
blind
limb of the esophagojejunal anastamosis without immediate
complication.

[**2175-11-29**] Non invasive venous studies : No evidence of bilateral
lower extremity DVT.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7173**] was admitted to the hospital and underwent the
aforementioned procedure which was tolerated well.  He returned
to the recovery room in stable condition with good vital signs
and adequate pain control.  He was transferred back to the
surgical floor for further recovery where he continued to make
good progress.  He did have some tachycardia on post op day 2
with O2 saturations of 95% on 4L nasal cannula.  He had a Chest
CTA which was negative for PE and he continued with DVT
prophylaxis.  He underwent vigorous chest PT and incentive
spirometry and his O2 saturations improved.

An upper GI was done on [**2175-11-22**] which revealed no anastomotic
leak.  He had a feeding jejunostomy placed at the time of
surgery and tube feedings were begun after his bowel function
returned. His surgical wound was healing well without evidence
of erythema. He was up and walking without difficulty but
continued to have periods on tachycardia and a mild O2
desaturation. He also had a rising WBC.  A CT of the
chest/abdomen  and pelvis was done on [**2175-11-26**] which revealed a
fluid collection around the EJ anastomosis as well as a PE in
the Right lower lobe. It also showed multifocal pneumonia.  A CT
guided drainage was subsequently done on the fluid collection
and he was placed on IV heparin for his PE.  He was also placed
on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Flagyl until organisms were identified.

The Infectious Disease service was consulted as he multiple
organisms in the gram stain of his wound culture including
yeast.  They recommended Micofungin instead of Flagyl until
sensitivities were available.  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] looked much better
after drainage of his abscess and his WBC was decreasing.  He
remained afebrile.

Coumadin was started for his PE and INR's were checked daily.
His heparin was changed to Lovenox to allow him more mobility
and the Lovenox was discontinued when his INR was 2.0.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] will monitor his INR and dose his Coumadin starting
[**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2174-12-11**].

He had a PICC line placed for long term antibiotics and
Vancomycin and Zosyn were changed to Ertapenum.  His Micofungin
will also continue.  The length of antibiotic therapy is yet to
be determined.  He will have a fistulogram next week followed by
an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and he will also be followed
by the Infectious Disease service as an outpatient with weekly
CBC's, BUN,creatinine and LFT's to follow.

After a long hospital stay he was discharged home on [**2175-12-7**]
with [**Date Range 269**] services for IV antibiotics, PICC line care and drain
care as well as Coumadin teaching.  He remains NPO and all of
his nutrition is coming from J tube feedings of Replete with
fiber cycled at 120cc/hr over a 14 hour period.  Hopefully as
his nutritional status improves his leak will seal off and he
will be able to begin an oral diet.
