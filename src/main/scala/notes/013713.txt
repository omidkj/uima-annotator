Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4111**]
Chief Complaint:
Direct admit from Nursing Home for malnutrition and chronic
aspiration, plan to have jejunostomy tube placement.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**5-12**] open jejunostomy tube placement
[**6-2**], open jejunostomy tube placement following dislodged
previously placed tube
[**6-21**], [**Month (only) 26092**] IR jejunostomy change (attempted change of
10Fr to larger size)
[**7-4**], unable to fundoplicate via Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
(EGD)
[**8-16**], Tracheostomy under local and change of J-tube to 14
Fr tube

History of Present Illness:
80M with dysphagia supported on TPN who presents for feeding
jejunostomy placement.  Prior to admission he was reported to
have fever and (+)blood cultures from rehabilitation center.

Past Medical History:
1. A gastrointestinal bleed in the [**2091**], treated with a
Billroth II surgery.
2. Atrial fibrillation since the [**2101**] for which the patient
was placed on anticoagulation with Coumadin.
3. Gastric adenocarcinoma discovered in [**2119**] after a
recurrent gastrointestinal bleed, treated with partial
esophagogastrectomy. This adenocarcinoma is stage IB. The
patient's Coumadin was discontinued at that time.
4. History of stroke in [**2121-4-12**]. The patient was placed
back on Coumadin at this time. He has been on Coumadin
since.
5. Hypertension.
6. Osteoarthritis.
7. large GI bleed in [**2124**], so off all anti-platelets or
anti-thrombotics
8. hx of mantle cell lymphoma treated with five cycles of
R-CHOP,in remission.
9. recent perianal lymph node biopsy for ? lymphoma (uptake on
recent PET scan) on [**3-25**] with complication of urinary retention.
bx results showed poorly-circumscribed leiomyoma
10. reflux, which is likely largely due to bile reflux given his
past history of a vagotomy and partial gastric resection

RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 26093**] the procedure. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the attending radiologist was present and supervising

approach. Final internal length is 36 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW PO
Reason: ? Aspiration

VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW EVALUATION: Study done in conjunction
with speech and swallow division. Multiple consistencies of
barium were administered to the patient under constant video
fluoroscopy. Oral phase demonstrates severely impaired bolus
formation, bolus control, and tongue movement. Premature
spillover was consistently seen prior to initiation of swallow.
The pharyngeal phase was characterized by moderate delay in
initiation of pharyngeal swallow. Significant residue remained
in the valleculae and piriform sinuses after swallow.
Penetration and aspiration were seen with multiple consistencies
of barium.

RADIOLOGY Final Report CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS
Reason: NEW APHASIS, RIGHT UPPER WEAKNESS - ASSESS FOR VASCULAR
INJURY
Comparison is made to prior MRI dated [**2128-4-3**] and prior
CT dated [**2128-4-2**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT
There are areas of encephalomalacia from previously identified
right MCA distribution stroke involving the right frontal,
temporal, and subinsular region with bilateral old lacunar
infarcts involving the basal ganglia. Evidence of acute major
vascular territory stroke, hydrocephalus, shift of midline
structures, or hemorrhage. Osseous structures and soft tissues
appear unremarkable. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
well aerated.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK
Please note there was very poor contrast opacification of the
neck and intracranial vessels due to infiltrated IV during bolus
injection. This poor opacification makes accurate interpretation
on the CTA not possible. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted
bilaterally at the regions of the carotid bifurcation.
IMPRESSION:
Areas of encephalomalacia from old right MCA distribution stroke
and bilateral basal ganglia lacunar infarcts. No evidence of
acute major vascular territorial infarct or hemorrhage.
CTA uninterpretable due to suboptimal bolus from IV
infiltration. The patient may return to the department for a
repeat CTA if clinically needed at no additional cost.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE / Reason: Assess for carotid stenoses.
INDICATION: New right-sided hemiparesis, history of stroke.
Carotid ultrasound examination was performed bilaterally.
RIGHT SIDE: There is mild plaque at the distal common carotid
artery and proximal internal carotid artery with respective peak
systolic velocities 61 cm/sec, and 51 cm/sec. The peak systolic
velocity in the external carotid artery 86 cm/sec. ICA/CCA ratio
0.84. The flow in the vertebral artery is in antegrade
direction.
LEFT SIDE: There is mild plaque in the distal common carotid
artery and proximal internal and external carotid arteries with
respective peak systolic velocities 52 cm/sec, 33 cm/sec, and 79
cm/sec. ICA/CCA ratio is 0.63. The flow in the vertebral artery
is in antegrade direction.
IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal internal
carotid arteries bilaterally. This is a baseline examination at
the [**Hospital1 18**].

OBJECT: 80-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY WEAKNESS AND
HX OF
STROKE, NOW WITH WAXING AND [**Doctor Last Name **] MENTAL STATUS. PLEASE
EVALUATE FOR
SEIZURES. REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: The background is slow and disorganized and
reached a
maximum of 6.5-7 Hz posteriorly during wakefulness.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were bursts of generalized delta frequency

slowing occasionally better appreciated on the left side.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed as this was
requested as a portable study.
SLEEP: No normal transitions between wakefulness and sleep were
seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: An irregular cardiac rhythm was noted with an
average
heart rate of 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and

disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing
suggestive of
an encephalopathy. Infection, toxic metabolic disturbances, and
medication effects are among the most common causes. No clear
epileptiform features were seen and no electrographic seizures
were
seen.
