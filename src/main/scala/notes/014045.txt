Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she became hypotensive. Levophed was begun. Vent
settings were changed after her first gas intubated was
7.21/68/285. Her CVP as 4 and she was given 5L NS and 1 unit [**12-5**]
NS once Na was back. R IJ and R art line was placed. Labs were
drawn which showed hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, and
normokalemia. At 3:43 AM, she went into an atrial tachycardia
with a rate of 160's with her pressure dropping into the 40's.
Code was initiated. She was cardioverted into sinus rhythm with
200J and blood pressure resumed. Vasopression was started with
the attempt to quickly wean off the levophed. She had very
labile BP in next 1 hour ranging anywhere from 80 on max vaso
and levo to 180 off both. She again entered into an atrial
tachycardia and I cardioverted her with 100J into sinus rhythm
again. During this time, the intern called the grandson again
and reiterated her poor prognosis. The grandson decided to make
the goals of care comfort. Pressors were stopped and the patietn
was placed on a T-piece.
