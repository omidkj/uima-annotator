Service:  OME


The patient was on the Biologic Service.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
female with metastatic mucosal melanoma admitted today to
begin cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy.  Her oncologic
history began in [**2159-9-26**] when she started to have
rectal pain initially thought to be hemorrhoids.  She began
over-the-counter agents but did not get relief and was
eventually referred to a surgeon who felt this was an anal
fissure in combination with hemorrhoids for which she
recommended steroids and over-the-counter remedies.  On
[**2160-3-10**] she underwent surgery with a rectal mass noted.
Biopsy revealed melanoma with tumor cells staining positive
for S100, Melan-A, HMB45 anti-tyrosinase.  Torso CT revealed
left hilar adenopathy, two indeterminate densities at the
right hemithorax and numerous hepatic lesions highly
suggestive of metastatic disease.  On [**2160-4-11**] she started
temozolomide 5 days on and 23 days off with radiation to the
rectal region for pain relief.  She received 4 of 5 planned
fractions.  She completed 2 cycles of Temodar in [**Month (only) 116**] with
torso CT showing interval progression in the perirectal
adenopathy and liver lesions.  She was referred here to
discuss treatment options and high-dose IL-2 was recommended.
Her nuclear stress test revealed no EKG changes but there was
a perfusion defect.  It was unclear if this was artifact so
she underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2160-6-30**] revealing
a 30% to 40% stenosis of the LAD felt to be hemodynamically
insignificant.  She passed eligibility testing and is now
admitted to begin cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Melanoma as above, osteopenia, anxiety
disorder with insomnia, status post TAH-BSO, status post
laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2154**], history of low blood
pressure.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married with 3 daughters.  Lives in [**State 1727**]
where she owns a restaurant.  Prior heavy smoking 1 pack per
day x30 years,  currently smokes 6 to 7 cigarettes per day.

MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl 50 mcg topically daily, ondansetron 8
mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. nausea, multivitamin tablet daily,
senna C 3 tablets at bedtime, Prozac 20 mg daily.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing female in no
acute distress.  Performance status 1.  VITAL SIGNS:  98.1,
85, 18, 96/66, O2 sat 95% on room air.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Sclerae anicteric.  Moist oral
mucosa without lesions.  LYMPH NODES:  No cervical,
supraclavicular or bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1/S2.  CHEST:  Clear.
ABDOMEN:  Rounded, soft, nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
SKIN:  Intact.  NEUROLOGIC EXAM:  Nonfocal.

ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 10.1, hemoglobin 13.4, hematocrit 40.1,
platelet count 335,000, INR 1.1.  BUN 12, creatinine 0.6,
sodium 138, potassium 3.7, chloride 100, CO2 27, glucose 119,
ALT 33, AST 29, CK 37, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 4.5,
calcium 9.4, phosphorus 3.0, magnesium 2.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and underwent
central line placement to begin therapy.  Her admission
weight was 66.9 kg and she received interleukin-2 600,000
international units per kilo equalling 40.3 million units IV
q. 8 hours x14 potential doses.  During this week she
received 9 of 14 doses with doses held related to development
of shock and toxic encephalopathy.  Her course was also
complicated by acute pulmonary edema with respiratory
distress syndrome.  Hypotension was initially noted on
treatment day 4 with initial response to a fluid bolus.
Hypotension was related to capillary leak syndrome from IL-2
therapy.  She developed recurrent hypotension, this time
requiring the initiation of vasopressor therapy with Neo-
Synephrine.  Continuous blood pressure bedside and central
telemetry monitoring were instituted.  No cardiac arrhythmias
were noted.  IL-2 therapy was held while on Neo-Synephrine.

On treatment day 5 she was noted to be lethargic and confused
consistent with toxic encephalopathy.  Frequent safety checks
were instituted per nursing policy.  IL-2 therapy was held
throughout that day given mental status changes.  On
treatment day 6 she was tachypneic with hypoxia and chest x-
ray confirmed acute pulmonary edema.  She initially responded
to nebs and Lasix but again became tachypnea with hypoxia
requiring an ICU transfer.  In addition she became
hypotensive at that point requiring initiation of Neo-
Synephrine blood pressure support again.  In the ICU she was
treated with BiPAP and serial cardiac enzymes were done to
rule out cardiac source which were negative.  Echo revealed a
normal LVEF.  She was aggressively diuresed and ruled out for
an infection.  She was eventually transferred back to the
floor on [**2160-7-9**] where she initiated physical therapy.
She had some borderline oxygen saturations and was thus sent
home with home oxygen therapy on [**2160-7-13**] after otherwise
recovering from treatment.

Other side effects from IL-2 this week included nausea and
vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy; diarrhea; fatigue
and development of an erythematous pruritic skin rash.  Her
rectal pain was managed with fentanyl patch, p.r.n. oxycodone
and topical lidocaine.  During this week she developed acute
renal failure with a peak creatinine of 1.3 improved to 0.4
at the time of discharge.  She had associated oliguria and
mild metabolic acidosis noted with a minimum bicarb of 18.
She was treated with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict I & Os were maintained.  IV fluids were significantly
decreased given acute pulmonary edema in the setting of renal
failure.  She developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 234
and a peak AST of 151, both improved within normal limits at
the time of discharge.  She developed hyperbilirubinemia with
a peak bilirubin of 2.6 improved to normal at the time of
discharge.  She was anemic without need for packed red blood
cell transfusion.  She developed mild thrombocytopenia with
platelet count low of 132,000 without evidence of bleeding.
She had no coagulopathy or myocarditis noted.  By [**2160-7-13**]
she had recovered from side effects to allow for discharge to
home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  She was alert, oriented and
ambulatory.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with her family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 1
week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by shock, acute
pulmonary edema and acute renal failure.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol 320 to 650 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.
