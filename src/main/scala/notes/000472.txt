AMS and tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
59F with PMH of stage 4 colon CA s/p R hemicolectomy in [**2098**],
s/p chemo with recurrence and currently consented for phase I
trial who was referred by PCP for increasing confusion,
abdominal pain, and poor po intake.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.8 151 124/79 16 98% on
RA. She was found to be oriented x2, jaundiced, and endorsed RUQ
pain. Her exam was notable for jaundice, sinus tachycardia,
palpable mass in RUQ, abd nt, guaiac neg stools, and +asterixis.
Labs were notable for WBC 24.3 with left shift, positive UA,
ammonia level 61, VBG 7.50/40/51/32, Lactate 3.0, Na 129, K 3.0,
Cr 0.6, ALT: 39 AP: 756 Tbili: 9.4 Alb: 3.1 AST: 164, negative
Utox. Head CT showed no acute process. CTA chest was performed
to rule out PE, which was a suboptimal study, that showed Small
R pleural effusion with RLL atelectasis, multiple b/l pulmonary
nodules up to 6mm slightly increased in size from prior, but no
no central PE. It also showed innumerable hepatic metastases
infiltrating and enlarging entire liver, increased in number and
size since previous CT with marked compression of intrahepatic
IVC, hepatic veins, and portal veins, no biliary ductal
dilation. There was moderate increased perihepatic ascites. RUQ
US was notable extensive intrahepatic mets, patent main portal
vein. She was given 3.5L fluids and started on vancomycin and
aztreonam for empiric abx coverage.

Of note, her HR was noted to be 144 at her most recent onc visit
on [**11-8**]. She had complained of pain in her knees and back,
reportedly taking [**5-28**] vicodin per day. Her pain med regimen was
changed at that time to 10mg oxycontin [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone for
breakthrough. She had also complained of nausea relieved by
lorazepam 1mg approx [**Hospital1 **]. She did not complain of abdominal pain
at that time, and no confusion was noted.

Her vital signs on transfer were 129 112/77 20 100%. On arrival
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her vitals were 97.7, 130/74, 127, 18, 94% on RA.
She complained of feeling tired and weak over the last few days
with nausea, no vomiting or diarrhea. She also endorsed
increased urinary frequency over the last few days, dizziness,
and confusion. She denies fever or chills. Her history is
unreliable however, as she is only oriented to self and
hospital.

FOLFOX which was complicated by severe neuropathy, minor PORT
problems and nausea.
-- [**2099-3-12**] She had a takedown ileostomy resection of distal and
proximal ileum w/ enterostomy.
-- [**2099-7-28**] her CT torso showed no evidence of disease.  At this
time her CEA was 1.6 ([**2099-8-6**]).
-- She was followed serially and on [**2100-3-9**] her CEA had risen to
9.3.
-- [**2100-3-16**] CT abdomen that showed 4 solid appearing lesions w/in
the liver consistent w/metastatic disease
---- [**2100-8-11**] she was seen in consultation with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
and tentatively planned for colon resection, Right lobectomy,
segmental liver resection, IOUS, and resection of prior
ileosigmoid anastomosis on [**2100-8-27**].  A pre-operative CT torso was
done [**2100-8-11**] and again showed unchanged liver lesions (when
compared to [**7-28**] study), unchanged pelvic adenopathy and no new
interval lesions.
--[**2100-8-29**] MRI showed an 8-mm lesion in the left proximal
humerus, concerning for metastasis.  Surgery was indefinitely

due to recent PORT, Avastin started on C2
--[**2101-11-1**]; disease progression seen on CT scan. Started on
Erbitux/CPT-11. Rec'd a total of 7 cycles. treatment was
complicated by hypomagnesemia and severe diarrhea with several
doses of chemotherapy being held.
--[**2102-6-14**] CT with interval progression and >20% increase in
hepatic disease burden, no new disease sites, CEA rising
-- [**2102-6-20**] C1D1 Capecitabine 1500mg PO BID
-- [**6-27**]--[**7-2**] admitted for confusion and Klebsiella UTI
-- [**2102-7-17**]-started on CapeOx. C1 c/b n/v during infusion,
