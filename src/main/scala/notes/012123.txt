Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
# Apparent asthma flare

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
# Intubation

History of Present Illness:
19-year-old female h/o (1) presumed asthma requiring intubation,
(2) vocal cord dysfunction, (3) depression and (4) conversion
disorder, with multiple psychiatric admissions, now admitted for
apparent asthma flare.  Patient was in her usual state of health
when she went running on the evening of admit, after which she
reportedly experienced dry coughing and difficulty breathing.
Patient then used her asthma nebulizers and called her
pulmonologist, who advised her to continue nebulizer treatment.
Patient experienced no relief with nebulizers, and upon the
advice of her pulmonologist, presented to the emergency room.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted in [**10/2150**] and intubated
for respiratory distress [**3-20**] presumed asthma flare and PNA, and
was diagnosed at that time with paradoxical vocal cord
dysfunction per ENT fiberoptic study.  Prior hospitalizations
for asthma exacerbations had also involved intubation.
.

.
ROS per mother: Significant only for dry cough shortly before pt
presented to ED.

Past Medical History:
# Question asthma: Patient had been treated for asthma since
[**2148**], with home medications including prednisone, albuterol,

# Question paradoxical vocal fold dysfunction: Diagnosed per ENT
fiberoptic exam 9/[**2150**].

[**Hospital1 2025**] psychiatry ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**] MD), pt demonstrated fictitious
symptoms including asthma, hyperventilation, LOC [**3-20**]
hyperventilation, pseudo-seizures, and self-induced cellulitis.

# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-12-1**] 8:42 PM
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. No acute cardiopulmonary disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
19F h/o questionable asthma requiring previous intubations, as
well as conversion disorder and depression, admitted with
presumed asthma flare with intubation in the ED, no ABG.
.
# Respiratory distress: Possible etiologies included conversion,
anxiety, PNA, or true asthma flare.  No ABGs were performed in
the ED before patient was incubated, and therefore there were no
laboratory data as to whether patient was becoming hypercarbic
with respiratory failure.  Per ED records, it appeared that
patient was intubated given a clinical picture of increasing
respiratory distress.  Past spirometries were normal, but
performed in setting of recent bronchodilator administration;
therefore, no spirometry studies had been recorded comparing
lung function before and after bronchodilator use.  Current vent
settings are 500 cc x16, PEEP 5, FIO2 35 %.
.
Diagnostic: SBT in a.m. to assess whether pt demonstrates active
bronchospasm by increasing PaCO2 with respiratory work.  Pt not
continued on steroids or bronchodilators; consider assessing
CBC/differential for eosinophilia.  CXR to monitor for possible
PNA, which is unlikely given recently completed five day course
of azithromycin.
.
Management: SBT on HD2 was successful and pt had no further
respiratory distress.  N osigns of infection, or asthma
exacerbation with no wheezing on exam.  Likely episode was
seconday to paroxysmal vocal cord dysfunction.  Arranged follow
up appointment with allergy physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 68303**] on Monday
[**12-7**].  No futher steriod treatment needed a this time, will
discharge on home medications.
.
# Conversion disorder: Patient had been diagnosed with
conversion disorder per [**Hospital1 2025**] psychiatrists, with identified
symptoms including respiratory distress.  Patient was recently
intubated in [**2150-10-17**] for presumed asthma exacerbation,
and with this latest intubation, appeared to have accelerated
her hospitalizations possibly [**3-20**] increased stress in her school
or personal life.
.
Diagnostic: Patient has a long-term relationship with [**Hospital1 2025**]
psychiatry.
.
Management: Will refer pt back to [**Hospital1 2025**] psychiatry for follow up
.
# Depression: Pt had h/o depression requiring medications
although currently not taking lamotrigine.  As this hospital
admission was possibly related to increased school stress,
consider psychiatry outpatient f/u to assess coping skills,
extent of depression, and relationship with conversion disorder.
.
# Paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction: During last
hospitalization for presumed asthma exacerbation, patient was
scoped by ENT who diagnosed patient with paradoxical vocal cord
dysfunction given vocal fold adduction during inspiration.
Patient was advised to seek speech therapy as outpatient.  Given
that this is a stable issue, and may likely be related to her
conversion disorder, defer additional diagnostic workup for
outpatient management.
