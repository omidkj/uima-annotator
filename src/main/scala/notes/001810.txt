Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis [**3-22**]
Bronchoscopy with biopsy [**3-23**]

History of Present Illness:
This is an 85-year old gentleman with 6 months of dyspnea and
recent diagnosis of likely right upper lung primary cancer with
diffuse mets, and recent thoracentesis diagnostic on the right,
who is presenting with worsening dyspnea 24 hours after a
thoracentesis. He has a 15 pack year smoking history (quit 20
years ago) presenting with worsening shortness of breath and
cough for the past few months. He explains that he has had
worsening dyspnea with exertion for the past few months which
has now progressed to shortness of breath even at rest. He has
also noticed a worsening cough during this time. No hemoptysis
but occassionally lightly  brown tinged sputum. He denies any
chest pain, fevers or chills. He reports a mild lost of weight
and with decreased appetite over the past few months.

A chest x-ray on [**2119-3-14**] showed two large pulmonary masses in the
right upper lobe (6.7 x 5.9 and 3.9 x 2.6 cm) as well as several
additional nodular opacities in both lower lobes. A subsequent
CT showed stage IV lung cancer with right upper lobe primary,
satellite nodules, bibasilar metastases, and bilateral effusions
right greater than left.

He was seen by IP on [**3-16**] who performed a right-sided ultrasound
guided thoracentesis removing 1250 cc of fluid. He initially
felt better however in the last few days he started having
worsening shortness of breath and difficulty lying flat. No
chest pain and no fever.

On arrival to the ED his initial VS were 97.8 140/52 60 24 sat
92% on room air. A chest x-ray showed worsening pleural
effusions. He was sent for a CTA to rule out a PE. He was given
1L NS prior to the CTA. Per report during the CTA, while lying
flat and receiving the contrast, he became more acutely short of
breath with increasingly labored breathing, tachypneic to 30,
and desaturating to 86% on 3L NC. Expiratory wheezes and
crackles bilaterally were appreciated. He was given duonebs,
40mg IV lasix, and started on a nitro drip at 0.42 mcg/kg/min. 1
SL NTG was also given. An EKG showed atrial flutter with 4:1
conduction but no ischemic changes. He was subsequently
saturating 80% on FM and so was started on BiPAP, a foley was
placed, and he was admitted to the ICU.

Vital signs at the time of transfer were hr 57 bp 135/55 80% on
FM, 99%/BiPAP.

On arrival to the MICU the patient appeared to be in no acute
distress and was breathing comfortably with sats of 93% on 5L
NC.

MICROBIOLOGY
[**2119-3-20**] Blood Culture: No growth

IMAGING
[**2119-3-20**] ECG: Atrial flutter with 4:1 block or this may be
consistent with atrial tachycardia with 4:1 block. Non-specific
septal and inferior ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2118-11-3**] findings are similar

[**2119-3-20**] CHEST (PA & LAT): Known right upper lobe lung mass, and
multiple bibasilar pulmonary nodules, redemonstrated. CHF. Mild
increase in the moderate right pleural effusion, and stable left
pleural effusion.

[**2119-3-20**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: Metastatic lung
cancer, with a right upper lobe primary mass and multiple
satellite metastatic nodules in both lungs, not significantly
changed since the earlier study of [**2119-3-14**]. Moderate right and
small left pleural effusion, have slightly enlarged since
[**2119-3-14**], especially given the fact that the patient underwent a
right thoracentesis in the interim. Increasing bibasilar
atelectasis. No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic
pathology.

[**2119-3-20**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No acute intracranial pathology.
Moderate-to-severe involutional changes and small vessel
ischemic disease. No evidence of metastatic disease. Please note
that a non-enhanced MRI
study would be more sensitive for metastatic disease.

[**2119-3-21**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The diameters of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderatemitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-11-17**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation. Based on [**2112**]
