.
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe ill-defined opacity which is
nonspecific, and may represent an area of atelectasis or
infection. There is an adjacent small left pleural effusion.
.
EKG
Sinus rhythm @ 96bpm. Low precordial lead voltage. Technically
limited study. Baseline artifact. ST-T wave flatteing
inferiorly. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CT chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolism or secondary signs
of embolism.
2. In the absence of history of malignancy, a 4-mm pulmonary
nodule warrants no further follow- up unless there are risk
factors for malignancy, in which case follow- up in one year is
recommended.
3. Impacted proximal right humeral fracture, partially imaged.
.
2D echo:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Mild symmetric LVH. Left ventricular function is
probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
LLE duplex:
IMPRESSION: Negative for left lower extremity DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with COPD exacerbation and PNA admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
hypoxia.
.
#. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure - Etiologies included COPD
exacerbation and PNA with left lingular infiltrate on CTA, with
CTA negative for PE.  Patient denies any cardiac history, but
may also have a small component of volume overload on exam.  Has
BLE edema, bilateral crackles, unable to assess JVP based upon
body habitus.  Patient has history of hypercapnea and has
required intubation in past.  Patient's current ABG is
7.30/78/64/40.  Patient was on BIPAP over the first night for 5
hours, quickly weaned to face mask, then nasal cannula by 2nd
day in ICU. Initially given IV solumedrol, CTX, azithromycin for
CAP, and lasix 40mg IV, and standing nebs.  The patient
clinically imprved and was transitioned to the inpatient floor.
There was a question of whether or not acute systolic or
diastolic CHF was contributing to her symptoms.  A 2D echo was
limited because of her body habitus but showed preserved
systolic function.  She was continued on her home dose of Lasix
which she takes for LE edema.  Her steroids were transitioned to
PO and she will complete a slow taper.  Antibiotics were
transitioned to PO Levaquin.  She remained stable on her home O2
requirements of 2-3L.
.
#. Anemia, acute vs. chronic, normocytic - Unknown baseline. Hct
remained stable during this hospitalization.
.
#. Type 2 DM:  Patient was monitored on HISS while inpatient.
Her metofromin was initially held but restarted at discharge.
.
#. Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
.
#. s/p RUE fx and R 4th and 5th MT fracture - Continued LE
splint.  pain control was obtained with oxycodone 5mg q4hrs prn
.
#. Hypertension:  Patient on Diltiazem, lisinopril at home.
Patient also reports a possible abnomal heart rhythm in the
past.  Currently in NSR.  Home medications were initially held
due to low BPO but were reintroduced as she clinically improved.
.
# Conjunctivitis:  The patient developed some irritaiton and
redness in her left eye the day of discharge. There were no
signs of pustular discharge and the patient denied any red flag
symptoms.  Patient was afebrile.  EOMI.  Antibiotics not
indicated.  Gave supportive care.
.
# Dispo- d/c back to rehab for further care.
