See the MICU Green Admission note for further details. Briefly,
this is a 54M with severe COPD on home O2 (noncompliant), OSA,
HTN, multiple psychiatric diagnoses admitted with cough and
progressively worsening dyspnea. In the ED, the patient was

Studies:
[**9-7**] CXR: Bibasilar nodular opacities, more pronounced within
the left lung base, which may represent an infectious process.

[**9-7**] CT Head: 1. No acute intracranial process. Minimal white
matter hypodensity, compatible with sequelae of chronic small
vessel ischemia.
  2. Right cheek subcutaneous nodule for which clinical
correlation is advised.

[**9-7**] CTA Chest: 1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic
syndrome. Limited subsegmental evaluation.
  2. Scattered ground-glass opacities with a centrilobular,
peribronchovascular distribution with suggestion of peripheral
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities also noted. In the setting of esophageal
distention and fluid, with small tracheal secretions, this is
most compatible with aspiration.
  3. Mild centrilobular emphysema, as on prior study.
  4. Resolution of prior left lower lobe collapse.
  5. Patulous esophagus with air-fluid level, as seen on prior
studies. A non- emergent upper GI evaluation could be considered
for further evaluation.

Esophogram: The esophagus is diffusely dilated with abundant
tertiary
contractions. The gastroesophageal junction appears widely
patent; however, there is holdup of barium as well as a barium
tablet at the GE junction. The barium tablet passes with
multiple sips of water. There is proximal escape, with residual
barium seen in the esophagus throughout the duration of the
study. Evaluation of esophageal motility is limited due to
substantial residual barium in the esophagus.
IMPRESSION: Esophageal dysmotility.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 y/oM with severe COPD on home O2 (noncompliant), OSA, HTN,
multiple psychiatric diagnoses admitted wit
