Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ace Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, somnolence.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic paracentesis ([**6-6**]).

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 71 y/o man with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinomas (ineligible for the transplant
list) who presents from clinic with increasing shortness of
breath and somnolence. History was taken from wife and son, as
patient was too somnolent to answer questions.
.
Patient was recently discharged [**6-4**] after admission for
hyponatremia (see below). He went to [**Hospital 1036**] Rehab for less
than one day and had a follow-up appointment in liver clinic on
morning of admission. Per family, he was coughing clear phlegm
last night, went to his scheduled appointment with Dr.
[**Name (NI) **] where he was diagnosed with possible URI and
prescribed clarithromycin, Zolpidem, and albuterol. After the
appointment family felt that he did not look very well. He
became increasingly short of breath and somnolent and was noted
to be shaking and coughing up green mucus. At this point his
family decided to bring him to the emergency room.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 99 (101.6 rectally), HR 131, BP
106/61, RR 28, sat 100%. Lactate was 5.7. Labs otherwise
remarkable for sodium of 128 (baseline), potassium 5.2 with
normal renal function. Hct was 29.5 (baseline mid 20s) with
white count of 8.4 (increased from baseline [**5-5**] with 84% polys,
10% bands). Ammonia was 71. LFTs were ALT 33, AST 80, TB 28.7,
INR 2.9 (liver synthetic function steadily worsening over the
last 1-2 months). CXR showed increasing congestion in the right
hilum with ?RML/RLL infiltrate. CT head showed no acute
intracranial process and abdominal ultrasound showed slow flow
in the portal vein. Non-obstructive thrombosis cannot be
completely excluded but there is still some patency of the vein.
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed with cell count showing
4650 WBCs, cell diff pending.
.
In the ED, he was given Zosyn and vancomycin for empiric
treatment of HAP. He was given 500 cc IVF and admitted to the
MICU for tachycardia and somnolence. Vitals at time of transfer
HR 107, BP 106/53, RR 17, sat 98% on 4L. Access is two
peripheral IVs.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 81256**]/10 for worsening
hyponatremia. His diuretic regimen was uptitrated, and he was
kept on a fluid restriction. His sodium improved on this
regimen. His total bilirubin during that admission had been
trending up. His MELD was 29 but he is not a transplant
candidate given that he has four known liver tumors on imaging.
Also of note during that admission, there was a hematocrit drop
with oozing from a paracentesis site and blood in his urine
after foley placement. He received 2u PRBCs during that
admission.
.
Goals of care have been recently addressed between patient and
palliative care service. Per recent discharge note, on [**5-29**]
patient told palliative care that he would like to be DNR/DNI,
however his wife and HCP stated that he was to be full code.
Further conversation was deferred to Dr. [**Name (NI) **] in the
outpatient setting.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: pt denies headache, chest pain or pressure,
shortness of breath. Patient endorses mild abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
# HCC dx [**8-8**]: 4 known hepatocellular carcinomas, so ineligible
for the transplant list. One of his tumors was treated with
radiofrequency ablation and the others were not amenable to this
treatment. The remaining tumors were treated with CyberKnife
irradiation of which he had 3 treatments starting on [**2-20**] and ending on [**2104-2-22**].
# Cryptogenic cirrhosis diagnosed [**8-8**]
# CAD with +ETT-MIBI [**2103-10-18**]
# Pancreatic cystic mass of unknown etiology
# Reactive PPD with +[**Doctor Last Name **] gold [**2103-10-16**]
# Hypertension
# Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Pt was born in [**Country 77717**]. He was living with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1411**]
until his recent hospital admission. He is a retired flooring
contractor. He previously drank >3 glasses of wine per for ~50
years but has not drank since [**2103-5-2**]. No tobacco or
recreational drug use. After the previous admission he has not
been walking. He is becoming increasingly bed-bound and
dependent on family for assistance.

Family History:
Brother died of stomach cancer. No other known family history of
malignancy.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 71 y/o man with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and HCC,
recent admission for hyponatremia, now presents with altered
mental status, tachycardia, and possible pulmonary infiltrate on
chest x-ray.
.
# Tachycardia, Hypotension, Bacteremia, SBP: Patient was found
to have positive blood cultures from the day of admission with
Kleibsiella and GNR on paracentesis. Patient was started
empirically on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for coverage of SBP
and possibly HAP. Pt had a hct drop to 19, and it was thought he
developed a hemoperitoneum from rupture of HCC. After
