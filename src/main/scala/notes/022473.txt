Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization X 2


History of Present Illness:
70yo Chinese speaking man with history of previous IMI [**2134**],
hypertension, and borderline diabetes presenting with dyspnea
and chest pressure. The patient was in his normal state of
health until a couple of months ago when he noted progressive
dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure on exertion. Previously
he had been able to walk a kilometer without symptoms. Over the
past month he has been able to walk only 200 meters before
becoming short of breath and developing chest pressure. He flew
from [**Country 651**] on [**2145-6-4**] and is planning to remain in the U.S.A.
until [**2145-10-9**]. He also experienced shortness of breath
during the flight. Since that time he has had progressively
severe and more frequent episodes. He presented to the ED today
with two days of severe dyspnea and chest pressure brought on at
rest.
.
In the ED, HR 132, BP 160/100 RR 14 91%RA. Initial ECG revealed
sinus tachycardia with possible ST-elevations V2-V3, Q in III.
He was treated with metoprolol 5mg iv x4, 50mg po and SL
nitroglycerin. Pain did not resolve. Repeat ECG revealed TWI I,
aVL, V5-V6. A nitro gtt was started, and the patient was then
chest pain free.  Emergent cardiac cath revealed 3VD and Echo
revealed 20% LVEF with AI and MR.  After cath, patient brought
to CCU on nipride gtt.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension:  *5.0 cm  <= 4.0 cm

Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  4.9 cm  <= 5.0 cm

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  *7.5 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  20%  >= 55%
Aorta - Valve Level:  3.6 cm  <= 3.6 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Severely dilated LV cavity.
Severe global LV hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. RV function depressed.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Moderate
(2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Impression:
1.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral akinesis
with a basal inferolateral aneurysm.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed (mild).
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mioderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

[**6-21**] Coronary catheterization
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: CHF, CAD
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic biventricular dysfunction.
3. Severe mitral regurgitation.
4. Class IV congestive heart failure.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant
circulation with three-vessel coronary artery disease. LMCA had
mild
diffuse disease. LAD had a 60% mid-vessel stenosis between D1
and D2.
A large LCx was totally occluded before a large, branching OM1
system,
which filled via collaterals from the a small distal LCx system.
RCA
had a mid-vessel 60% stenosis, diffuse 60-70% distal vessel
disease.
Distal RCA was then occluded prior to a moderate-sized R-PLV.
R-PLV
filled via collaterals from the left.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred because of marked
elevation of
filling pressures.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate pulmonary
hypertension (65/39 mmHg). Right- and left-sided filling
pressures were
markedly-elevated (RA mean 20 mmHg, PCWP mean 42 mmHg with "v"
waves to
52 mmHg).
