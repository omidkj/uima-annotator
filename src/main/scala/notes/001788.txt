Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 year old male with new diagnosis of
alcoholic cirrhosis who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
significant GI bleeding.  He was discharged five days prior to
presentation, and reports that he had no pain at the time of
discharge.  Over the next few days, he developed right upper
quadrant abdominal pain.  Two days prior to discharge saw his
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] ordered a RUQ US that was performed on the day of
admission.  That imaging test showed a probable portal vein
thrombosis and he was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.
.
In the ED, his VS were T 97.8, BP 121/73, HR 70, RR 16, SpO2
100% on RA.  The patient appeared jaundiced (present at
discharge) but had a quite distended abdomen, which he said was
worse than baseline.  After discussion with Hepatology the
patient was admitted for further work up.  Given his recent GIB,
Heparin was held pending cross sectional imaging and discussion
with attending in the AM.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient reported mild RUQ
discomfort but denied pain, confusion, tremor, or any other
acute changes.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive per HPI for RUQ discomfort,
abdominal distention, and ~10 lb weight gain.  Also endorsed
loose stools getting worse since discharge.  Finally, endorsed
darkened urine.  Denies fevers, chills, night sweats, rash,
pruritus, confusion, somnolence, slurred speech, chest pain,
dyspnea, headache, or visual changes.


Past Medical History:
# Alcoholic cirrhosis -- newly diagnosed at last admission
# GI Bleeding -- known esophageal varices
# Gastritis
# Hypertension


Social History:
The patient is a project manager for an electronics contractor.
He was working up until his recent hospitalization.  No history
of tobacco use.  Up until his last hospitalization, he was
drinking 3-4 beers/day.  He denies any alcohol over the last two
weeks.  Denies any illicit drug use.

Family History:
Coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus. His mother had
emphysema.

Imaging / Studies:
# CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST ([**2193-1-18**] at 1:14 AM):
The lungs are clear. There are coronary artery calcifications
and calcifications are noted in the thoracic aorta without any
aneurysmal dilatation. There is a very large esophageal varix
seen just superior to the gastroesophageal junction. In
addition, there are numerous tortuous periesophageal varices as
well. These varices are fed by a dilated coronary vein the
appears to be decompressing the patient's portal hypertension.
The cirrhotic liver is shrunken and nodular suggestive of end
stage liver disease. The portal vein and all the major portal
branches are patent. There is no focal lesion seen within the
parenchyma. The gallbladder is partially collapsed and
unremarkable. The spleen, adrenals and kidneys and pancreas are
unremarkable. There is ascites seen surrounding the liver and
the spleen and tracking inferiorly along the right paracolic
gutter. There is a small spleno-renal shunt. There are scattered
mesenteric lymph nodes; however, none meet CT criteria for
lymphadenopathy. Note is made of edematous wall of the ascending
colon, likely the result either from underlying hypoalbuminemia
or the portal hypertension. Otherwise, remaining loops of small
and large bowel appear essentially unremarkable.
BONES: There is an old compression fracture seen at T12.
Otherwise, there are no other additional evidence of acute
fracture. There are no lytic or sclerotic lesions suggestive of
metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:
1. Nodular shrunken liver suggestive of cirrhosis.
2. Ascites seen surrounding the liver and the spleen.
3. Large coronary vein with gastric varices and very large
esophageal and perasophageal varices.
4. The portal vein is well opacified and there is no evidence of
any filling defect (clot) within the portal vein or the major
branches, including the SMV and the splenic vein.
5. Edematous ascending colon bowel wall likely secondary to low
albumin and portal hypertension.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2193-1-18**] at 2:49 PM):
An NG tube lies with its tip in the duodenum. The trachea is
central and the cardiomediastinal contour is normal. There is
volume loss evident in the right lung base with an airspace
opacity adjacent to the right heart border, better appreciated
on the lateral view consistent with right lower lobe
consolidation or atelectasis. While this could reflect
atelectasis given the volume loss, in the appropriate clinical
setting pneumonia is also a possiblity. Small bilateral pleural
effusions. Multiple old rib fractures.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe airspace opacity may reflect
atelectasis or pneumonia.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 58 year old male who was recently discharged
on [**2193-1-12**] after an admission for significant GI bleeding, with
newly diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis, esophageal varices,
and severe portal hypertensive gastropathy.  He presented
several days after discharge with RUQ pain, decompensated
cirrhosis, and question of portal vein thrombosis on RUQ
ultrasound which was later ruled out with CTA abdomen.
.
# Acute on Chronic Liver Failure: He was recently diagnosed with
alcoholic cirrhosis on his prior admission from [**2193-1-10**] to
[**2193-1-12**] for GI bleeding and discharged with outpatient followup
after being stabilized.  His transaminases, bilirubin, and coags
this admission had worsened significantly compared to those at
his prior admission.  He had MELD score 36 and DF 145.  Portal
vein thrombosis was an initial concern given the reported
results of his RUQ ultrasound, but was ruled out by CTA.
