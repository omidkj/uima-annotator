Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sotalol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, bilateral leg edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial tap and drain placement


History of Present Illness:
71yo F PMhx Afib on coumadin and amiodarone, systolic CHF (LVEF
15-20% on TTE [**2127-1-17**]), nonischemic cardiomyopathy, VT s/p
ablation and ICD/PPM, complete heart block, severe TR, CKD, with
two recent hospital stays in since [**Month (only) 359**] for shortness of
breath thought to be secondary to CHF exacerbations who now
presents after being referred from her PCP's office for SOB,
orthopnea, LE edema, and lethargy. Patient was recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 57530**] and [**Date range (1) 60504**] for dyspnea on exertion. On
both admissions patient was diuresed, second admission was also
notable for cardioversion of afib and increase in her amiodarone
from 100mg daily to 400mg daily. Of note, patient reports she
never returned to her baseline after each admission. Since her
recent discharge, patient reports worsening BLE edema, weight
gain of 2lbs, and worsening DOE, orthopnea (now sleeping on
couch because her breathing is better) and cough. On day of
admission, patient was seen by her PCP with above complaints as
well as reports of single episode blood streaked sputum, and
single episode of non-positional non-exertional L shoulder pain
that resolved with tramadol at home. PCP felt patient was volume
overloaded and in need of inpatient diuresis, referred patient
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was afebrile with normal and stable vital
signs. Exam was significant for crackles throughout lungs. CXR
demonstrated enlarged cardiac silhouette. Bedside echo performed
by ED staff demonstrated pericardial effusion and cardiology
consult was obtained. On evaluation by consult, bedside TTE
demonstrated large circumferential pericardial effusion without
ventricular diastolic collapse. Given hemodynamic stability,
patient was scheduled for AM pericardiocentesis and admitted to
CCU for further monitoring

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 96 | 83 | 95/58 | 15 | 97%
-In general, well developed, well nourished, A&O X3, NAD.
Eyes - Pallor and icterus absent.
Oral cavity - Moist.
Neck - No lymphadenopathy.
Axilla - No lymphadenopathy.
Chest - Normal vesicular breath sounds. Basal crackles.
CVS - Pulse irregularly irregular. Normal heart sounds.
Abdomen - Soft. Non tender. No palpable organomegaly. Normal
bowel sounds.
Extremities - [**12-8**]+ edema
-skin examination: on the bilateral lower extremities are
multiple tan-brown to erythematous macules predominantly on the
pretibial surface. scattered individual lesions have
telangiectatic prominence. occasional tan brown papular lesions
as well. R and L arm, neck, as well as the upper back are
similar lesions as described above. areas of focal linear
excoriation along lateral forearm. no lesions on the palms or
soles, scattered red papules c/w cherry angiomata

Echo [**10-29**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15
mmHg. LV systolic function appears (moderately to severerly)
depressed. RV with (mildly) depressed free wall contractility.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade

Liver/ gallbladder US: 1. No hepatic mass identified and no
biliary dilatation seen.  2. Bilateral pleural effusions,
ascites in the right upper quadrant, and  pulsatile
bidirectional flow within the portal vein all of which are
consistent with right heart failure and possible congestive
hepatopathy


Brief Hospital Course:
71yo F PMHx multiple cardiac issues including non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 15-20% on TTE [**2127-1-17**]), complete heart
block s/p ICD/pacemaker, severe TR, two recent hospital stays
for dyspnea found to have large pericardial effusion without
evidence of tamponade, now s/p drainage w cytology demonstrate
primary effusion lymphoma

#Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: followed by renal consult
team. Unclear CIN vs ATN. Creatinine high was 6.6, decreased to
4.3 at discharge. Spironolactone was held at the time of
discharge because of renal function. Chem-7 should be checked in
2 days to monitor.

#Hyponatremia:  Thought [**1-8**] pseudohyponatremia. Resolved at
discharge

#Transaminitis. DDx includes lymphoma, amiodarone effect vs
Shock liver. RUQ US no hepatic mass, no biliary dilation. LFT's
improved over the course of hospitatization but were still
elevated at discharge. Amiodarone was decreased to 100 mg daily.
Simvastatin was held at discharge.

# Primary Effusion Lymphoma ?????? Drain placed for effusion, removed
uneventfully. ECHO showed no accumulation at discharge.
Cytology demonstrating primary effusion lymphoma, HIV neg and
HHV8 labs are negative. Pt was seen by oncology service who will
see pt after discharge for f/u of pending tests and plan of
treatment. Incidental lung nodules, sub-4 mm nodules in the
right lower lobe, noted on CT chest from [**2125-10-1**], recommended a
[**5-18**] month f/u exam based on pt's risk factors which was not
done at this institution. Allopurinol was started.

# Skin Lesions ?????? chronic purpuric lesions over extremities, in
setting of PEL, concern for KS. Dermatology team sent biopsy of
lesions which were not suggestive of Kaposi's sarcoma.

# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Signs of volume overload on
history and exam, likely exacerbation by worsening pericardial
effusion as described above. All meds held [**1-8**] [**Last Name (un) **] initially. Pt
was diuresed with lasix drip. Oral Lasix was restarted at
discharge but spironolactone and ACE inhibitor were held.
Carvedilol was continued.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Afib on coumadin and amiodarone. History
of CHB following remote ablation procedure for vtach, currently
A/V paced. Amiodarone was decreased to 100 mg daily for
increased LFT's. Warfarin was restarted prior to discharge.
.
# HTN: well controlled on carvedilol. Hydralazine and isordil
for afterload reduction was held because of borderline low blood
pressure at discharge.
.
Transitional care:
1. VNA assessment of VS and fluid status, monitoring of daily
weights
2. Consider chest CT in near future to evaluate pulmonary
nodules if not done already
3. Oncology f/u for treatment of Primary effusion lymphoma.
4. Labs on Friday [**2127-10-31**] to check kidney function and INR
5. Suture removal on [**2127-11-10**] of biopsy sites on leg and arm.


Medications on Admission:
