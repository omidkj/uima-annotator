History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71745**] is a 51y/o gentleman with history ETOH abuse and
hepatitis C who has had [**9-6**] ED visits and 1 admission related
to alcohol intoxication over the past month who was brought to
the ED because he was found to be very intoxicated. Of note, he
was admitted on [**2190-5-17**] due to EtOH, Hct 31 (in the setting of
hematuria, guaiac positive brown stool) and left AMA upon
arrival to the floor.
On the mornig of admission, he had just been discharged from the
ED for alcohol intoxication. He reports drinking when he left,
and he was picked up by EMS and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] at around noon.
He reports drinking heavily since he was a teen but has been
drinking a fifth of vodka daily for the past 3 months. No
withdrawal, no DTs because he says he is never sober. No
particular life changes that made him drink heavier over the
past 3 months. Has no desire to quit. Is living with his
girlfriend these days.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 74 104/69 16 97% RA. Labs
notable for Hct 34.9, plt 107. Serum EtOH 463. While he was
being assessed, he was noted to become hypoxic to 70% in the
setting of apnea for an unclear amount of time, and requited
noninvasive bag-valve mask ventilation. With physical stimuli as
well as Narcan, he began breathing again. 40 minutes later he
attempted to leave and required Haldol for restraint.
The ED staff has been concerned about his very frequent ED
visits and contact[**Name (NI) **] SW and the legal department ([**Last Name (un) 103334**]
Saunders). Though this is usually not done on the weekends, a
Section 35 was obtained from Superior Court Judge Ball. He is
admitted to [**Last Name (un) **] for management until his hearing on Monday.

On arrival to the floor, he is sleeping but easily aroused.
Denies pain. No shakes. Wants to leave and drink.

Brief Hospital Course:
51yo M with HCV, untreated, h/o depression with SA, asthma who
presents with EtOH intoxication initially on the floor and then
transferred to the ICU with large Valium requirement in the
setting of EtOH withdrawal and marked nursing needs who is now
being discharged from the ICU under section 35 to a treatment
facility for alcohol abuse.

# Alcohol abuse: EtOH 463 at admission, significant EtOH
consumption daily is most likely explanation for dramatic
benzodiazepine requirement on the floor. Patient was protecting
his airway, no vital sign abnormalities to suggest DTs now. No
known history of withdrawal seizures. Patient was maintained on
Diazepam 30mg q2hours PRN CIWA greater than 10 while in the ICU.
The patient was followed by Psych who recommended decreasing
Valium to 30 mg Q8 hours to minimize risk of reintoxication, and
hold and decrease dose if patient appears intoxicated.  Continue
to avoid Valium
PRNs unless patient develops objective signs of alcohol
withdrawal (tremors), and continue VS Q1 as you are doing. For
acute agitation unresponsive to verbal redirection, would use
Haldol 5 mg PO. Patient was startd on multivitamin, folate, and
thiamine and should be continued on these medications. He was
monitored with a sitter with physical restraints used as needed.
In the ICU, the patient was under surviellance by [**Hospital1 18**] security
in light of having broken a sitter's finger on the floor. No
restraints were needed in the ICU.
  OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ICU under section 35
to a treatment facility for alcohol abuse. Continuation of CIWA
protocol with Valium as needed for CIWA greater than 10.

# Anemia: Hct 31 now from baseline of 41, was 33 on [**5-16**], MCV
95. B12, folate within normal limit, iron low. EGD in [**2190-2-21**]
showed no varices. No known colonoscopy in the past. Most likely
GIB with upper source from gastritis due to EtOH vs varices vs
PUD vs Dieulafoy lesion vs [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear. Also possibly BM
suppression from EtOH given WBC and PLT lines down as well. No
hemodynamic instability at this time. Guaiac neg in the ED but
recently guaiac positive on previous visit to ED. Pantoprazole
was started during this admission and continued through ICU
stay. Iron supplementation was not started as an inpatient, but
this should be considered on an outpatient basis. Repeat EGD as
an outpatient should also be considered if there is no
improvement in anemia with iron supplementation.

# Transaminitis: AST:ALT >2 makes transaminitis
