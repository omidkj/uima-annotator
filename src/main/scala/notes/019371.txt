Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 86 yo female with PMHx of CAD, HTN, TIAs, hyperparathyroidism
on Unasyn at [**Hospital 100**] rehab for acute cholecystitis (no surgery,
cooling down w/ abx), presents with lethary. Patient denies
chest pain or abdominal pain. Patient is able to answer
questions but slow response.
.
In the ED patient was found to be thrombocytopenic and have
elevated WBC, she was also found to be hypercalcemic and was
given IVF. She underwent CTA to rule out PE as patient reporting
some dyspnea and was found to have PE in the R pulmonary artery
and left upper lobe branch. Patient was given vanc/levo/flagyl
for cholecystitis as felt unasyn could be contributing to
thrombocytopenia. She was seen by surgery in the ED who
recommended previous plan to hold off on any type of surgery
until patient more stable.

Micro:

Imaging:
[**2116-5-28**] - lower ext ultrasound -  1. Intraluminal thrombus
extending from the left common femoral vein to the popliteal
vein, nonocclusive.
2. Intraluminal thrombus extending from the right superficial
vein distally and possibly to the popliteal vein, also
nonocclusive.

[**2116-5-28**] - CTA chest -
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli, greatest within the distal right
main pulmonary artery extending into the right upper and right
lower lobes. Small pulmonary embolus within the arteries to the
left upper lobe. Ground-glass opacity and small right pleural
effusion distal to the major portion of pulmonary embolism could
reflect small pulmonary infarction.
2. Prominent, ectatic thoracic aorta.
3. Small intra-aortic thrombus, unchanged by imaging compared to
a CT from [**2116-5-14**].

[**2116-5-29**] - U/S liver - Persistent areas of thickening within the
gallbladder wall, and soft tissue within the lumen, with an
enlarged periportal lymph node. These findings are concerning
for gallbladder carcinoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o female with recent diagnosis of acute cholecystitis who
present from [**Hospital **] rehab with dyspnea found to have PE on CTA
and thrombocytopenia.
.
1. PE/DVT and thrombocytopenia: The patient presented with
multiple thrombi in lungs and legs.  She was found to have HIT
type 1 which was thought to be the main driver of the clotting.
Complicating her treatment was her simultaneous DIC which was
felt to be driven by her likely (although never biopsy proven)
locally advanced gallbladder cancer.  The patient was treated
with empiric antibiotics directed at acute cholecystitis but
further imaging was not consistent with active infection or
gallbladder inflammation.  The patient was felt to have both DIC
and HIT as she had a significantly positive PF4 antibody and
evidence of hemolysis and a consumptive coagulopathy.  In
discussions with the patient's family, given that the underlying
DIC cause (i.e. gallbladder cancer) was not treatable and
therapies for the HIT driven thromboembolic disease would put
her at significant risk for bleeding, comfort was made the prime
goal of care.  Over the course of the next day, her consumptive
coagulopathy progressed with resulting oliguria and depressed
mental status.  The patient's condition continued to deteriorate
and she expired in the early morning of [**2116-5-30**].  The family
(son and daughter-in-law) was [**Date Range 653**].  The family declined
autopsy.
.
2. Hypercalcemia - Patient with elevated calcium, appears to
have elevated CA at baseline. Most likely secondary to
hyperparathyroidism as this has been noted in OMR worsened by
the thiazide diuretic.
.
3. Diabetes - BS elevated, will cover patient with RISS
.
4. CAD - Patient with history of fixed defect on stress-MIBI.
- Will hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
- Continue BBlocker and statin once po
.
5. PPx - supratheraputic INR, tylenol, bowel regimin
.
FEN - NPO
.
Code - DNI/DNR, later changed to CMO following extensive
discussions with her next of [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor First Name 1975**] [**Known lastname 8024**] and his
wife.
