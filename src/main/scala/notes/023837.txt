HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old
African-American male who presented to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a six hour history of hematemesis on
[**2140-8-3**].  The vomiting had started earlier that morning
while he was sleeping.  It was not associated with any
abdominal pain, fevers, cough, shortness of breath, chest
pain, palpitations, or diarrhea.  Upon presentation to the
Emergency Department, NG lavage was performed and dark red
liquid was removed.  Having had no clearing after 1 liter the
patient was maintained on continuous suction.  The hematocrit
at that time showed a level of 29.  The decision was made to
admit the patient.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus, type 2, requiring insulin.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction noted
to be greater than 60%.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
7.  Bladder lesion.
8.  Prostate cancer with known metastasis.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 120 mg b.i.d.
4.  NPH 60 units q.d.
5.  Zocor 50 units q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a nonsmoker.  No history of
alcohol or drug use.

Once admitted from the Emergency Department, the patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:  Vital
signs:  T current 98.9, blood pressure 181/78, pulse 92,
respirations 20, saturation 97% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
General:  The patient was alert, cooperative, in no acute
distress.  The nasogastric tube was showing reddish brown
liquid draining.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  The
patient has no jugular venous distention.  No evidence of
anterior or posterior lymph node adenopathy.  The
.................... was noted to be negative.  Pupils were
equal and reactive to light bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  No evidence of any edema.
Rectal:  Positive for melena.  Extremities:  Warm, 2+ edema
in the lower extremities.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II
through XII were grossly intact.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On presentation, the patient's
white count was noted to be 17.6, hematocrit 29.6, platelets
235,000.  INR 1.2, PT 13.7, PTT 28.7.  Sodium 141, potassium
3.9, chloride 101, C02 26, BUN 35, creatinine 1.0, glucose
175.  The U/A was unremarkable.

The ECG was normal sinus rhythm at 90.

The chest x-ray was unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission from the Emergency
Department, the patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit.
In the Intensive Care Unit, a right internal jugular triple
lumen catheter was placed.  He was then resuscitated with 2
liters of normal saline.  Late on the evening of hospital day
number one, GI Service was consulted and preparations were
made for upper endoscopy.  This endoscopy showed two
submucosal bleedings; while there was evidence of recent
bleeding, neither of them were actively bleeding at the time
of the scope.  At this time, General Surgery was consulted
for possible intervention should the patient have an
exsanguinating event and for possible treatment plans.

General Surgery consult pointed out that the patient indeed
had significant comorbidities which should be considered in
designing a treatment plan.  These included insulin-dependent
diabetes times eight years, congestive heart failure,
hypertension, and a history of prostate cancer.  Most recent
echocardiogram on [**2140-7-18**] revealed no valvular
abnormalities, mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection
fraction of 55%.  Most importantly, the patient had 13 or 14
positive prostate biopsies for high-grade adenocarcinoma of
the prostate in [**2137**].  Most recent [**Doctor Last Name **] score was at least
8.  A bone scan in [**2137**] revealed upper and lower thoracic
activity and metastatic disease could not be excluded.  PSA
in [**2139-9-18**] had increased and the patient had been
started on q. three month Lupron.  This PSA had normalized in
[**Month (only) **] and hormonal therapy had been discontinued.  He is due
for a repeat PCA later this month.

Given the likely metastatic stage of the disease the patient
has in the past declined surgery and x-ray therapy for his
prostate.  Given the overall clinical picture, it was deemed
that the best course for this patient would be a minimally
invasive surgical approach that would allow resection of the
actually bleeding area.  Therefore, preparations were made
for laparoscopic wedge resection of the lesions.  This was
scheduled for hospital day number seven.

Surgery proceeded without any complications and the patient
was extubated and moved to the Intensive Care Unit in
relatively stable condition.
