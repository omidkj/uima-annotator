Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a right thoracotomy with
tracheoplasty and bronchoplasty.  See formal op note for
details.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
SICU extubated and in stable condition.  She had an epidural
catheter placed pre op and had adequate pain control and her
hemodynamics were stable.

She remained in the ICU for a few additional days to maintain
vigorous pulmonary toilet and also required vigorous diuresis
which helped to improve her oxygenation.  She has a history of
atrial fibrillation pre op and had some episodes of rapid
ventricular rates on post op day #2 which prompted adding a beta
blocker.  Her rates remained stable from that point on with
Diltiazem, Lopressor and Propafenone.  Her respiratory status
remained stable and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on
[**2186-8-8**].

Following transfer she progressed very well.  She able to
ambulate independently with oxygen on at 2 liters/min with
saturations of 94%.  She continued her bronchodilator treatments
and was using her incentive spirometer effectively.  Her right
thoracotomy site was healing well and her pain was minimal. She
was tolerating a regular diet.

On [**2186-8-9**] her Coumadin was resumed at her pre op dose and she
will continue follow up at the [**Hospital 1562**] [**Hospital3 **].
Her INR was 1.2 and she will have it checked on [**2186-8-14**]. The
[**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital was notified.
After a nominal recovery she was discharged to home on [**2186-8-10**]
and will follow up in the airway clinic in 2 weeks.
