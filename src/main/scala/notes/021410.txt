Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
39 year old woman with asthma and possible hypersensitivity
pneumonitis who presents with shortness of breath. She has had
6-7 years of progressively worsening SOB and has had an
extensive prior workup (please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 84946**] notes)
including an open lung biopsy in [**10/2118**] which was initially
thought to show sarcoidosis, but after re-review is more
consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. She has had
numerous prior ICU admissions for SOB and has been intubated in
the past. She has had worsening SOB for the past several days,
possibly worsened by the heat, and has been using her inhaler
more frequently so came to the ED.
.
In the ED initial VS were: afebrile, HR 115, RR in the 30s, sats
in the mid-80s which improved to 99% after a neb. On exam she
was taking rapid shallow breaths with poor air movement so got 3
back-to-back nebs with some improvement. She initially refused
steroids due to h/o steroid psychosis. She was given 4g
magnesium and 0.3mg 1:1000 subQ epi, and then agreed to take
solumedrol 125mg IV. She also got 2mg lorazepam x3 for anxiety.
VS prior to transfer were HR 134, BP 111/56, RR 27, 98% on a
continuous neb.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is tachypneic and speaking in
short sentences. Appears anxious and uncomfortable.


Past Medical History:
1. Asthma
2. Possible inflammatory lung process such as hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. (Had open lung biopsy in [**10/2118**] which was reviewed
by [**Hospital1 18**] pathologists and showed undefined inflammatory process
superimposed on normal lung,and poorly formed granulomas that
seemed to be consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis)
3. History of positive PPD (the patient reports that it was
borderline degree of induration for many years and has not
received INH. She states the reason for no INH was a clear CXR
4. PCOS
5. Postpartum depression requiring psychiatric hospitalization
6. Multiple miscarriages requiring D and C
7. Status post multiple colposcopies and cervical LEEP procedure

8. Meningitis in [**2118-12-11**]
9. Status post tonsillectomy

Social History:
The patient is divorced and lives in a home with her 3 children.
Works as a business analyst. Occasional etoh. Prior 1-1/2 pack
per day smoking for 15 years, quit in [**2106**]. High likelihood of
asbestos exposure according to the patient as she was a
volunteer firefighter in the past. History of positive PPD. Has
a dog, cat, a lizard and a hamster at home.


Family History:
Father alcoholic. [**Name2 (NI) **] family history of lung disease or DVTs.

IMAGING:
CXR (PA and lateral) [**2119-6-6**]: Lung volumes are improved compared
with prior.  There is no focal
consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal.  Chain suture is
again noted in the right mid lung. IMPRESSION:  Improved lung
volumes without acute chest abnormality.

EKG [**2119-6-7**]: Sinus tachycardia. Early R wave transition.
Non-specific ST segment changes
anteriorly. Broderline low voltage. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.

***CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2119-6-7**]:
FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear, with evidence of prior wedge
biopsy from the
right upper and lower lobes.  A subpleural 2-mm nodule in the
right upper lobe
is unchanged from [**2116**].  The pleural surfaces are normal without
effusion or
pneumothorax.

There is evidence of severe tracheobronchomalacia, with near
complete and, in
places, complete collapse of the trachea and bronchial tree
during dynamic
expiration.  At the level of the clavicular heads, the trachea
measures 2.3 cm
AP x 1.6 cm TV (314 mm2), which on dynamic expiration decreases
to 1.1 cm AP x
0.9 cm TV (56 mm2) (6; 9, 5; 14).  At the level of the aortic
arch, the
trachea measures 1.8 cm AP x 2.5 cm TV (350 mm2) on inspiration,
which on
dynamic expiration decreases to 0.6 cm AP x 1.2 cm TV (59 mm2).

The right and left bronchi measure 1.3 and 1.4 cm, respectively,
on the
inspiratory phase (2; 27) which progresses to near-complete
collapse,
measuring less than 2 mm on dynamic expiration (5; 24).  The
bronchus
intermedius measures 6 mm on inspiration (2; 27) and 3 mm on
expiration (5;
28).

The heart and great vessels are normal in size and
configuration.  There is no
pericardial effusion.  There is no central lymph node
enlargement.

Though this exam is not tailored for the evaluation of
infradiaphragmatic
structures, no abnormality is seen.  The size of the spleen
measures at the
upper limits of normal.

There is a subacute nondisplaced fracture of lateral left sixth
rib, new from
[**2119-3-12**].

IMPRESSION:
1.  Severe tracheobronchomalacia with air trapping.
2.  No lung parenchymal abnormality to suggest diagnosis of
hypersensitivity
pneumonitis or sarcoid.
3.  Subacute fracture of the lateral left sixth rib.


Brief Hospital Course:
39 year old woman with asthma and possible hypersensitivity
pneumonitis who presents with shortness of breath.

Acute issues:
# Tracheobronchomalacia (NEW DIAGNOSIS): Patient states symptoms
are similar to prior asthma exacerbations  but no wheezing on
exam and CXR shows no hyperinflation of lungs.  Pt initially
admitted to the MICU, but soon transferred to the floor.
Interventional pulmonology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and pulmonology (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] involved as outpatient care and inpatient advice.  CT
Trachea performed and showed severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Additional workup to be performed as an outpatient with possible
stenting in a few weeks.

Chronic issues:
# Anxiety/Depression:  Continued citalopram, trazodone.

# Sinus tachycardia: Likely related to anxiety.  No chest pain.
VSS. EKG unremarkable.  Improved over the course of admission.

Transitional issues:
# Tracheobronchomalacia: extensive outpatient workup required
prior to possible treatment. Appreciate excellent coordination
of care by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], et. [**Doctor Last Name **].  See d/c paperwork for
details.
