Final Report
COMPARISON: [**2181-2-24**].
FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the
postoperative period.
Small amount of pneumopericardium remains. No pneumothorax.
Bibasilar
atelectasis is also slightly better. Small pleural effusions are

demonstrated. Retrosternal gas on lateral view is likely related
to recent
surgery.
IMPRESSION:
Improving bibasilar atelectasis. Persistent small pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admission for mitral valve repair by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see operative note. In
summary he had a mitral valve repair, triangular resection of
the middle scallop of the posterior leaflet (P2)
with an annuloplasty of the mitral valve with a 30 mm future CG
annuloplasty ring. His bypass time was 65 minutes with a
crossclamp of 46 minutes. He tolerated the operation well and
following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. He weaned and was extubated on the day of surgery
and remained hemodynamically stable. On POD#1 his chest tubes
were removed and he was transferred from the intensive care unit
to the step-down floor. All other tubes lines and drains were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol. Once on the floor he
worked with nursing and physical therapy to improve ambulation
strength and endurance. The remainder of his post-operative
course was uneventful.
On POD 4 he completed physical therapy conditioning and was
cleared to be discharged home with visiting nurses. He will
follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-29**].
