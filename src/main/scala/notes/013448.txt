volume overloaded so given 120 iv lasix. EP interrogated device
and found one episode of vfib shocked to vtach. Also found
several episodes of vtach apparently ATP terminated. FVT zone
added to increase window for ATP to be used to reduce incidence
of shocks. Did not change lower limit of vt zone. There was also
