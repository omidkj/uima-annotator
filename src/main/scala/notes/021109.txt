Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9662**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 This is an 83 year old with a history of HTN, glaucoma,
hyperlipidemia who presents with acute onset shortness of
breath.

Ms. [**Known lastname 77456**] was in her USOH until 4 days ago she developed acute
onset DOE associated w/ fatigue and new mild cough and feeling
as though she was gasping for air.  She rested over the weekend
but on Monday decided to stay home as her sx had persisted w/ no
improvement but no worsening. She called her PCP and reported
her sx who referred her to the ED. She denies hemoptysis, sputum
production, lower extremity swelling, fever, chills, chest pain,
pleuritic pain, recent travel or any other associated sx.  No
h/o prior clot, miscarriages or family h/o blood clot.

Of note, approximately 6 mo ago she suffered an L1 compression
fx which has left her sedentary w/ recommendation for bedrest.
She has had excruciating LBP and R hip pain w/ multiple recent
cortisone injections for trochanteric bursitis.  She was a
previously active lady walking miles/day, working 4x/week and
athletic.  She is uptodate on her cancer screening w/ colonscopy
every 3 years for colonic polyps and mammagrams.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: 96.8 110, 113/66, 16, 100%
on RA.  Her physical exam was significant for L>R calves w/
associated tenderness. Labs were significant for d-dimer 6218,
troponin 0.05, creatinine 1.4, Hco3 20 and wbc 11.3.  Given
elevated d-dimer and calf assymetry, LENIs were obtained and
revealed DVT of the left popliteal vein and a left peroneal
vein. A subsequent CTA of the chest showed saddle and segmental
PE, no pulmonary infarct and evidence of right heart strain. AN
EKG demonstrated RBBB. She was started on IV heparin with a
bolus. Blood pressures throughtout her ED stay were in the low
100s.  A MICU bed was requested in the setting of saddle PE w/
R. Heart Strain. Vitals on transfer were:

This is an 83 yo F w/ no signficicant PMHx other than Fall in
[**Month (only) 404**] and has hip pain w/ limited ROM since that time. W/u for
fx has been negative. On thursday has had sudden onset dyspnea.
No orthopnea or PND.  Denies lower extremity edema. No f/c. BS
are clear. HR in 80s. On exam left lower extremity was swollen
and tender. D-dimer is positive. Got a CTA and demonstrated
saddle PE  + mass in renal. Started on heparin gtt w/ bolus. EKG
shows RBBB and ischemic inferior TWI which is old.  Vitals on
transfer: 97.5, 109/70 85, 20, 100%ra.

On arrival to the MICU,  97.5 159/91 21 100% in 1L NC. She was
comfortable and had no complaints.

unknown chronicity.

LENI:
IMPRESSION: Acute DVT of left popliteal and a left peroneal
vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is an 83 year old with a history of HTN, glaucoma,
hyperlipidemia who presented with acute onset shortness of
breath and was found to have saddle pulmonary embolism.  She was
treated with IV heparin and ultimately transitioned to coumadin.
 She incidentally was noted to have a new renal mass which was
felt to be normal variant anatomy on ultrasound.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Saddle Pulmonary Embolism: Saddle PE on CTA.  Evidence of RLE
DVT as possible source w/ associated calf assymetry. Possible
triggers included recent immobility in setting of back pain.
Hypercoagulability of malignancy was considered, but patient up
to date on screening and renal mass felt to be normal variant
anatomy.  IVC filter was considered but deferred given that she
was hemodynamically stable and not hypoxemic, and TTE of her
heart revealed an estimated PA pressure of 34. Risk factors for
mortality included troponinemia and elevated creatinine which
both resolved before discharge. She was bridged on heparin gtt
and started on coumadin [**2178-7-28**].  INR at discharge was 2.5.
She was sent home on warfarin 3 mg daily (decreased from 6mg for
initiation of TMP/SMZ antibiotics for UTI) and fondaparinaux 7.5
mg DAILY.  She will be followed by the [**Hospital **] Clinic at
[**Hospital1 **] Medical Assoc and her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 17**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
