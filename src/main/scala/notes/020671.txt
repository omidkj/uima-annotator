CHEST, TWO VIEWS ON [**9-23**]

HISTORY: Status post chest tube removal.

REFERENCE EXAM: [**9-20**].

FINDINGS: There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly and valve
replacement. There is volume loss at both bases that is similar
compared to prior. There is no overt pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 47639**] was admitted 3 days prior to surgery for mitral
valve replacement to be heparinized while off coumadin.
On [**9-18**] he was brought to the operating room where he had a
Mitral valve replacement with #25/33 On-X valve. Please see
operating room report for full details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CT ICU in stable condition. He did well in
the immediate post-op period, his anesthesia was reversed and he
extubated. On POD1 he was started on Beta blockers, diuretics,
heparin and Coumadin and he was transferred to the step down
floor for continued post-op care. On POD2 his chest tubes and
temporary pacing wires were removed, and over the next several
days the patients activity level was advanced. On POD6 the
patients heparin infusion was stopped as the INR had become
therapeudic. At that time it was decided that he was stable and
ready for discharge to home with visiting nurses.
