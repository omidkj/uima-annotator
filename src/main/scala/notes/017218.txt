Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia, Tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
63 y/o M with PMHx of COPD on home 1.5-2L O2 started after
recent admission for PNA/COPD exacerbation s/p intubation was
admitted with tachycardia and tachypnea.
After prompting by home nurse, pt was persuaded to come to ED
for respiratory  distress. Pt had been recently admitted [**2159-9-17**]
for subacute worsening hypoxia (70's% at rest and 60's% with
minimal exertion) [**3-10**] RLL PNA. He was started on azithromycin
and ceftriaxone for a presumed COPD exacerbation; and developed
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation on HD [**3-11**]
with successful extubation HD 4. He was given pulse dose
steroids, nebulizers and received a 5 day course of
levofloxacin, and was due to finish a prednisone taper starting
at 60mg with a planned 14 day taper, on the day of this
admission. Of note, despite improvement, he had persistent
episodes of desaturation to the 70s% with ambulation.

He denied fevers/CP/N/V/D, but endorsed ongoing productive
non-bloody cough and difficulty clearing secretions. He denied
any lower extremity swelling, palpitations, chest pain,
diaphresis, and lightheadedness. Of note, pending discharge for
most previous hospitalization, pt was able to maintain an
ambulatory oxygen saturation of 90% but was sent home with home
oxygen nevertheless. He was using 1.5-2L at rest and for
ambulation on presentation.
.
On arrival to the ED, his VS were T 97.4 HR 126 BP 123/72 RR 28
Sats 88% on RA, and 98% on 2L. Pt received solumedrol 125mg IV,
Albuterol/Ipratropium Nebs, Vancomcyin 1gram, Levofloxacin
750mg, Magnesium 2grams IV.  CXR showed improvement in RLL
infiltrate since last admission. Urine/blood Cx were sent. Due
to concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure, pt was admitted
to the ICU for overnight monitoring for need for intubation.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
63 y/o M with severe COPD presents with hypercarbic respiratory
distress c/w COPD exacerbation.  As above, pt initially admitted
to ICU for observation, did not require invasive or non-invasive
resp support, sx resolved with steroids/abx/Neb tx as above.  Pt
with 95%o2 sat on 0.5L NC at time of d/c, sx at baseline per pt.
<br>

# Hypercapnic respiratory distress [**3-10**] c/w COPD exacerbation
with contributions from secondary pulmonary hypertension from
COPD and resolving RLL PNA. Ruled out for MI.  Tachycardia
resolved with steriods and antibiotics, making PE less likely.
New PNA unlikely given absence of new infiltrate on CXR and
clinical signs of cough/fever.
- ambulatory sats day prior to d/c did not drop below 90%
- pt continued on prednisone 60mg QD, Rx 2 [**2-7**] week taper given
severity of baseline COPD and recent history, though pt with sig
sx improvement
- resume home COPD meds incuding albut/ipratropium inhalers,
advair, and tiotropium
- Azithromycin 500mg day [**4-11**] at time of d/c, Rx 2 more days
- maintain on home O2 2L by NC, wean as tolerated for goal
O2sats 90-95%
-Pt's PCP fu appt has been moved up to next week, pt to f/u.
<br>

# Leukocytosis: [**3-10**] to underlying COPD flare/resolving PNA;
steroid use. Infection was ruled out given normal lactate 1.9
wnl on admission; stable and improving RLL process on CXR;
LFTs/amylase/lipase were all WNL.
- Blood/UA neg, no diarrhea
- likely [**3-10**] steroids, afebrile, leukocytosis improving at time
of d/c at 13.3 from 19.3, PCP to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u.
- Azithro for COPD exacerbation as above
<br>

# Tachycardia: Resolved on admission to ICU, likely secondary to
primary respiratory distress. Unlikely to represent a PE given
that tachycardia resolved with nebulizers and steroid treatment.

<br>

# CAD: ECHO preported prior basolateral hypokinesis but ECG on
admission shows no ST changes, and Ruled out for MI.
- continued aspirin
<br>

# Schizophrenia: Severe psychiatric disease which has been a
barrier to medical care in the past when the patient has refused
to come to the hospital. ECG X3 negative for QTc prolongation
- Continue olanzapine 5mg qd, outpt f/u as per routine with
changes per PCP
<br>

# History of inpatient fall on admission [**2159-9-17**].
- Fall precautions while in-house, no events
- Pt c/s for gait stability
<br>

# Prophylaxis: Heparin sc TID, bowel regimen, PPI while on
steriods, Rx 3 week course at time of d/c with steroids above,
chest PT, [**Name (NI) **] while on steriods (while in-house), PT c/s
