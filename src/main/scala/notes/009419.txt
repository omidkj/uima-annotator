History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 yo f h/o CRI, HTN, GERD, colon ca,
neprhotic syndrome, dc'd [**3-31**] after low anterior resection of
colon. Now p/w 1wk h/o diarrhea worsened one day prior to
admission, found to have wbcc 30 in ED, admitted [**4-19**] and
started on both p.o. vanco and IV flagyl. Began to have brbpr on
[**4-25**], on [**4-30**] had flex sigmoidoscopy showing pseudomembranes with
recurrent c.diff vs. bowel ischemia as etiology. Then developed
some sob/fluid overload and was started on lasix and neseritide
gtt's. Had had some intermittent afib which was thought to be
contributing to presumed diastolic dysfunction. Tx to CCU
[**2192-5-12**] for worsening tachypnea and oliguria on nesiritide and
lasix gtt. Was cardioverted chemically with good result. Also
developed acute on chronic renal failure for which nephrology
has been following, zenith of 6.0, now back at baseline
creatinine of 2.0's.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo f w/ h/o CRI, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea,
c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc,
and negative ct. A brief-problem based hospital course is
outlined below.

1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin
and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad
spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was
initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and
trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so
diagnosis remains presumptive.  C. diff B toxin was sent and was
negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and
IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She
subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was
able to tolerate PO's.

2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with
resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had
no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we
were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel
or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of
tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic
phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal
pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing
severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not
surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage
was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results
showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po
vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is
quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were
the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and
resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there
may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was
performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis,
following completion of cdiff treatment.

2) acute renal failure w/ CRI-  Renal team was consulted on
admisison.  Baseline cr is approx 2.0.  On admission this was
significantly elevated to 4.1.  FENA was c/w prerenal etiology
and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume
resusciation.  This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an
albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT.  Fluids
were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day
and the patient has maintained oxygenation.   Alb/cr ratio not
c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low
alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of
500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and
improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and
returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that
her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to
ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive
overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis
given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips.
However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with
diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which
was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her
lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down
to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of
discharge.

3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic
on admisison.   Unclear why it was low when patient presented.
Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev
lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC
workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose
as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range
for the duration of her hosital course.

4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On
admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP
responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive.
She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and
isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.

5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be
40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event
precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to
have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal
hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to
her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed
medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for
management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV
lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU
briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her
CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negativ
