hypotension and rapid atrial fibrillation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
male who was in his usual state of health until the morning
of admission, while on the golf course, he felt dizzy,
lightheaded, and fell to the ground.  EMTs were called and
patient was taken to [**Hospital3 24768**].  He was thought to be
in ventricular tachycardia, and was given adenosine and
shocked.  He went into a rapid atrial fibrillation, given
diltiazem and Lopressor.  Patient developed some hypotension
and was started on dopamine.  Patient was sent to [**Hospital6 1760**], and in route, he had
ventricular tachycardia times two.  He was started on a
lidocaine drip.  When patient arrived, he was on dopamine at
10, lidocaine at 3, without any symptoms.  Throughout all of
this, the patient had no chest pain, shortness of breath, or
palpitations.  Of note, patient had one episode of syncope
one month ago in a similar situation while golfing.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Angioplasty 15 years ago at [**Hospital6 **].  Unknown
anatomy.
2.  Hypertension.  Off medications for 3+ years.
3.  High cholesterol.
4.  Right shoulder surgery for chronic dislocation.
5.  Cataracts three to four years ago.
6.  Tonsillectomy.
7.  Syncope one month ago.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco one pack per day, alcohol four to
five drinks per day.  Patient is a retired salesman for GE
for ten years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had an myocardial infarction in his
70s and hypertension.  [**Name (NI) **] father and uncles had
gastric cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 105/71. Heart
rate 146.  Oxygen saturation 96%.  General:  Patient is a
pleasant, obese, white male in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck was
obese with no jugular venous distention appreciated.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rhythm, tachycardic, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Abdomen obese, nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurological:  Patient alert and oriented times three, moving
all extremities.

Electrocardiogram showed aflutter with 2:1 block with a rate
of 150.  Patient's previous electrocardiogram showed ST
depressions in I, II, V2 through V5, V6 and a T wave
inversion in III, Q in III and atrial fibrillation.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild congestive heart
failure.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 14, hematocrit 48,
platelets 241,000, INR 1.3, CK 168, MB of 9, troponin of 3.2.
Urinalysis was negative with greater than 300 protein.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.4, chloride 104, bicarbonate 24, BUN
22, creatinine 1.2, calcium 10.3, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus
4.0, glucose 142.  At outside hospital, CK was 115 and
troponin of 0.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient on admission had no further
ventricular tachycardia on telemetry.  He had a CK that
peaked at 274, third troponin was 6.8.  Patient was sent to
the EP Laboratory where he had an AICD placed for inducible
ventricular tachycardia.  He was continued on Toprol XL 100
for rate control.  He had an echocardiogram that showed an
ejection fraction of 25% and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
Patient then had a Persantine thallium that was negative.  He
was started on an ACE inhibitor for his low ejection
fraction, Zestril 5.  Patient was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit the day following admission after having
his AICD placed. He had no further episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post ventricular tachycardia arrest.
2.  AICD placement.
3.  Left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of
25%.
4.  3+ mitral regurgitation.
5.  History of hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol XL 50.
2.  Amiodarone 400 b.i.d. times two weeks, then 400 q.d.
times three months, then 200 q.d.
3.  Zestril 5 q.d.
4.  Aspirin 1 q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  Patient will follow-up at the Device Clinic on
[**2193-6-19**].  He will also follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2193-7-16**] and on [**2193-6-19**], he will have pulmonary
function tests for being on the amiodarone.  He had LFTs that
were within normal limits.
