History of Present Illness:
56 year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis and HCC s/p liver
transplant ([**2156**]) with recurrent decompensated hepatitis C
cirrhosis, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension
admitted [**2161-11-1**] with acute worsening of chronic low back pain.
Patient has had chronic LBP attributed to scoliosis of
lumbosacral spine.  He reports prior flares lasting 2-3 days.
The current flare began approximately 3 days ago, following a
scheduled weekly paracentesis (6L removed).  The pain is
localized to the lower back and does not radiate.  He denies
bowel or bladder retention or incontinence or difficulty with
ambulation.  He believes this may be related to increased
physical activity over the past 1 week. In the past, he has
received epidural steroid injections.  Narcotic use has been
limited by encephalopathy.

LUMBO-SACRAL SPINE (AP & LAT) [**2161-11-1**]
Essentially unchanged levoscoliosis of the lumbosacral spine
with no evidence of new compression fracture.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2161-11-4**] 6:00 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of the transplanted liver with markedly
dilated portal veins. No thrombus is present.
2. Stable splenomegaly, collaterals, and worsening
intra-abdominal ascites.
3. Mild-to-moderate layering right pleural effusion with
compressive atelectasis. Development of plate-like atelectasis
left lower lobe.
4. Kidneys without hydronephrosis and nonspecific stranding. At
the lower pole of the left kidney, a single non-obstructive
calculus is remaining measuring 5-6 mm.
5. Segmental wall thickening and mural edema of the sigmoid
colon, nonspecific in the setting of ascites. Mild uncomplicated
colitis cannot be excluded. No rim-enhancing lesions,
pneumatosis or extraluminal air. No evidence of bowel
obstruction.
.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2161-11-6**]
1. Increased intrinsic signal abnormality within the L2-3 disc
with surrounding endplate signal changes since the previous MRI
of [**2161-9-19**]. Subtle soft tissue prominence is also identified,
but no definite fluid collection is seen. No evident paraspinal
soft tissue prominence seen. These findings could be due to
advancing degenerative change or due to low-grade infection.
Given the clinical suspicion of infection, further evaluation
with repeat lumbar spine study with gadolinium is recommended.
Given patient's low EGFR, a consent could be obtained and,
clinically, it should be determined whether the study is
important for any decision making.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes are identified as above with
spinal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 levels as well as at L2-3
level.
.
[**2162-1-10**] CT abdomen/pelvis IMPRESSION: 1. Right-sided pleural
effusion, unchanged compared with the previous study. 2.
Moderate-to-large ascites, unchanged compared with previous
study. 3. No reaccumulation of the retroperitoneal fluid
collection which was previously drained.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 56 year old male with hepatitis C
cirrhosis/HCC s/p liver transplant ([**2156**]) with recurrent
decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, diabetes
mellitus type II, who was admitted for acute on chronic low back
pain and was found to have coag-negative staph bacteremia and
L2-3 discitis / osteomyelitis.
.
Initial [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]:
.
# GPC Bactermia: He has had several prior episodes of bacteremia
requiring removal of his HD catheter.  Blood culture from his HD
line on [**2161-12-2**] grew coag negative staph.  Spinal plain films
from his admission on [**2161-12-1**] were unrevealing.  CT abdomen
pelvis on [**2161-11-4**] showed no acute findings concerning for
infection.  His HD catheter was removed on [**2161-11-5**] after an
early HD session.  Noncontrast MRI on [**2161-11-6**] showed possible
low grade discitis at L2-3.  Multiple consecutive blood cultures
from [**11-2**] to [**11-12**] grew coagulase negative staph.  His continued
bacteremia was concerning for a persistent source of infection.
TTE and TEE showed no evidence of endocarditis or paravalvular
abscess.  ID was consulted and recommended an 8 week antibiotic
course.  He was treated with Vancomycin following HD protocol
from [**2161-11-4**] through [**2161-11-11**] without clearing the bacteremia, at
which point he was switched to Daptomycin.  Gallium and bone
scans showed no evidence of infection except for the region of
discitis at L2-3.  His Daptomycin dose was increased from 500 mg
Q48H to 650 mg Q48H on [**2161-11-19**] per ID recs for 8 week course to
be completed with last dose on [**2162-1-7**] per ID.  A new tunneled
HD catheter was placed on [**2161-11-20**].  He has subsequent clinical
deterioration with new low grade fevers to 100.0 on [**2161-11-23**] and
100.1 on [**2161-11-26**], blood culture positive for GPCs on [**2161-11-24**],
and worsening back pain with new radiation to the buttocks.
