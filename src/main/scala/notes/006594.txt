Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 86 yo woman with h/o Parkinsons and HTN who
presented s/p fall with T9 compression fracture.
.
#. S/P Laminectomy and fusion:  Patient had a fall at home and
suffered a compression fracture of T9.  She had a laminectomy
and fusion of T8-T10 on [**10-5**].  She endured the surgery without
complication.  She had two drains in place in the incision site,
which were both pulled during this hospital admission.  The
patient attempted to wear a TLSO brace, but this was deemed too
uncomfortable for the patient at this time.  Physical Therapy
worked with the patient during this admission, and they feel
that she could benefit from further training and assistance at a
rehabilitation facility.  The patient has slight sensation in
her lower extremities, but she is not able to move her legs
voluntarily.
.
#. Shortness of Breath:  Patient had an episode of shortness of
breath on [**10-8**].  She was found to have a white-out on CXR.  She
was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible
hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She had a PICC placed on [**10-9**], and
the placement CXR showed resolution of the acute process.  The
patient was discharged on Vancomycin and Zosyn in the setting of
possible pneumonia.
.
#. Delerium:  Per the geriatrics team, the patient had an
episode of fluctuating cognition after her surgery.  She was
thought to have hypoactive delerium secondary to advanced age,
recent surgery, narcotics, and admission to hospital.  The
patient's famotidine prescription was changed to omeprazole and
she was placed on Miralax daily for adequate bowel control.  The
patient did not have any more acute events of delirium during
this hospital stay.
.
#. Pneumonia: On [**10-8**] am she developed acute resp distress.  CXR
showed opacification of the Left lung.  O2 sats remained stable.
 Thereafter she was started on vanco/zosyn for presumed hosp
acquired pna.  F/u CXR showed resolution of this infiltrate but
given the acute nature of her resp issues, the antibiotics were
continued.  PICC was placed.  PLEASE PULL PICC ONCE IV ABX NO
LONGER NEEDED.
.
#. Pain: The patient is currently on Tylenol and Morphine for
pain.  She states that her pain is well controlled on this
regimen.   She needs bowel regimen for constipation in the
setting of narcotics.
.
#. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:  The patient had an episode
of AFib with RVR on [**2168-10-6**].  The patient was asymptommatic.
She was given IV Metoprolol and Diltiazem, and she was then
placed back on her home dose of Diltiazem.  The patient
converted back to NSR and has remained in this rhythm for the
remainder of her hospital course.
.
# Parkinson's Disease:  The patient has a h/o parkinson's.  She
was maintained on her home dose of carbidopa/levodopa on this
admission and did not have any acute events during this hospital
stay.
.
# CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI.  Reconfirmed with patient and daughter.
