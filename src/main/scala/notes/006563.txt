History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 yo F with chronic back pain, spinal

back pain.  Patient experience chronic back pain and bilateral
leg pain for several years now. However, since a few days ago,
she has acute lower back pain and bilateral whole leg pain, so
severe that she could not walk. At baseline, she walks with a
cane and does ADLs independantly. She claims that the low back
pain is sharp with radiating bilateral tingling leg pain. She

deformity of the mid thoracic spine.

[**2144-7-24**] CXR - No evidence of pneumonia

[**2144-7-25**] CXR - Possible slight interval increase in patchy left
perihilar opacity -- this could represent an early pneumonic
infiltrate. Otherwise, no significant change compared with
[**2144-7-24**]. Stable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2144-7-25**] 8:37 PM

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN

Reason: R/o abscess, collection
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with new back, L3 compression fracture new on
XR, also febrile with no source
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R/o abscess, collection
INDICATION: New L3 compression fracture on plain films, fever of
unknown origin.

COMPARISONS: MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2140-10-23**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained of
the lumbar spine. Axial T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained
from the L1/2 through L5/S1 interspaces. Post-gadolinium
T1-weighted images were also obtained.

MRI L-SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are multilevel
degenerative changes involving the lower thoracic and lumbar
spine which appear slightly worse when compared to the previous
exam. There is loss of intervertebral disc space height at
multiple levels, disc desiccation and multiple disc bulges.
These disc bulges are associated with facet degenerative changes
at multiple levels, most marked at L3/4 and L5/S1. There is no
significant central canal stenosis.

There are mild-to-moderate compression deformities involving the
L2, L3 and L5 vertebral bodies. Compared to the previous exam
from [**2140**], the degree of compression deformities are slightly
worse. However, there are no signal abnormalities associated
with these compression deformities indicating that they are
likely chronic.

There is hyperintense T2/STIR signal identified within the L2/3
and L5/S1 disc interspaces. This is new when compared to the
previous exam. This raises the suspicion for infection although
definite post-contrast enhancement is not seen. There is no
evidence of an epidural mass or collection. The alignment of
lumbar spine is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Hyperintense T2/STIR signal within the intervertebral disc
spaces at L2/3 and L5/S1. This hyperintense signal raises the
suspicion for infection/discitis and clinical correlation is
recommended.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes involving the lower thoracic
and lumbar spine which appears slightly worse when compared to
the previous exam. No evidence of significant spinal stenosis.
3. Mild-to-moderate compression deformities involving the L2, L3
and L5 vertebral bodies which also appear slightly worse when
compared to [**2140**]. However, no abnormal signal is associated with
these compression deformities indicating a chronic nature.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2144-7-27**] 8:30 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: interval consolidation

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with fever
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval consolidation
INDICATION: Fever. Evaluate for interval consolidation.

COMPARISON: [**2144-7-26**].

AP CHEST: Again, there is cardiomegaly, and prominence of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Congestive failure has improved.
The right lung volume is low, and there is right basilar
atelectasis. Linear areas of atelectasis at the left lung have
increased compared to yesterday. No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Improved congestive failure and no definite
pneumonia.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2144-7-27**] 3:18 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: HYPOTENSIVE EPISODE, FUO, POSSIBLE DISCITIS, ON
STEROIDS, EVAL FOR INFECTIOUS PROCESS.
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with hypotensive episode, FUO, possible
discitis? On steroids
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o intradominal infectious process
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST WITH RECONSTRUCTION
DATED [**2144-7-27**]

COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis [**2140-10-12**].

INDICATION: Hypotensive episode, fever of unknown origin, and
possible discitis. Patient on steroids, evaluate for infectious
process.

TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was obtained through the abdomen and
pelvis after the intravenous demonstration of 100 cc of nonionic
contrast. In addition, oral contrast was administered.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Limited imaging of the lung bases
demonstrates cardiomegaly and coronary artery calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion. There are tiny bilateral
pleural effusions, which are new. Scattered opacity is seen at
both lung bases which may be atele
