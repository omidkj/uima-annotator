Intraop TEE [**2128-1-5**]
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal
limits).
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing for slow
ventricular rate. Preserved biventricular systolic function from
pre-cpb. LVEF = 35%. MR is now trace. Aortic contour is normal
post decannulation

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2128-1-5**] where the patient underwent coronary
Artery Bypass Graft Surgery x 2 Left internal mammory artery to
Left anterior descending artery, reverse saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery.  See operative note for full
details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and titrated up as blood pressure tolerated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  He
did go into atrial fibrillation and was loaded with Amiodarone.
After 24 hours of paroxysmal  atrial fibrillatiion, he was
started on Coumadin on post operative day 3. Coumadin follow up
with INR goal of [**12-25**] was arranged with this PCP Dr [**First Name (STitle) **].  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication per protocol.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD **** the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
