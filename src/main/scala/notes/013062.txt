regurgitation
is seen.

mitral
regurgitation is seen.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through a 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French XBLAD 3.5 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Visualization of the left coronary artery was repeated after the
i.c.
administration of 50 mcg of nitroglycerine.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

PTCA COMMENTS:
  We elected to treat the totally occluded proximal LAD with
PTCA/Stenting using heparin and integrilin prophylactically.  A
Choice
PTXS wire crossed into the LAD with significant difficulty (a
Wizdom SS
wire and several PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] Intermediate wires would not cross).
 A 2.5
x 15 mm Voyager was used to predilate in five inflations at 8-9
atm.  An
export catheter would not cross beyond the proximal LAD, but
suctioning
of this area resulted in minor improvement in flow. A 2.5 x 24
mm Taxus
DES was deployed proximally and into the mid-LAD at 12 atm, and
another
2.5 x 24 mm Taxus DES was deployed in overlapping fashion more
distally
at 12 atm.  The second SDS was used to post-dilate the overlap
area at
18 atm.  There was significant spasm and no-reflow in the
[**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
intracoronary nitroglycerin and nitroprusside were adminstered
through
the guide, and more intracoronary nitroprusside was administered
through
the lumen of a 2.0 x 30 mm Maverick positioned just distal to
the second
stent.
  Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual
stenosis
within the stented segments with loss of a major diagonal branch
(closed
at the start of the case), and TIMI-3 flow into a diffusely
diseased
distal LAD.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
system
with two [**Company 12425**] CAD.  The left main had mild disease.  The LAD
had a 70%
lesion at it's origin and a 100% proximal occlusion.  The left
circumlfex artery had a 70% lesion in the OM1 branch.  The RCA
had mild
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and
left
sided filling pressures with a
