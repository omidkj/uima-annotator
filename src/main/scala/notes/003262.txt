Pertinent Results:
[**2107-2-4**]
Introp TEE
Pre-Procedure:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 10 - 15 %). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is significant calcification of the ascending aorta. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The patient was started on NTG and his PA pressures came down
from 70/35 to 55/30 with modest improvement of RV fxn. LV
remained severely depressed.
Based on the epi-aortic scan and the surgeon's assessment of the
ascending aorta, the procedure was changed to an off-pump LIMA -
LAD CABG only. The plan was to refer the patient for a
trans-vascular aortic valve replacement.
Post-procedure::
The patient is on low-dose phenylephrine.
RV systolic fxn remains mildly depressed.
LV systolic fxn is severly depressed.
AI remains trace.
MR is trace.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 74-year-old male who presented to an outside hospital
with chest pain, exertional dyspnea, and ruled in for
non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction.  He had an echocardiogram
that revealed a decline in his ejection fraction to 10% from 30%
in [**2099**].  He also had aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area
of 0.8 cm2. Cardiac catheterization  demonstrated 3-vessel
coronary artery disease with 60% left anterior descending artery
stenosis, 70-95% left circumflex artery stenosis, an occluded
right coronary artery with poor left-to-right collaterals.  He
was taken to the operating room on [**2107-2-4**] and underwent an
off-pump coronary bypass grafting x1 with the left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery.  The aorta
was palpated and found to be heavily calcified throughout the
entire ascending aorta all the way down to the annulus.
Intraoperatively Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was asked to evaluate the level of
calcific anatomy, and confirmed Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] findings. A discussion
was carried out as to what options the patient had.  It was felt
that it would be a prohibitively high risk to replace the aortic
valve, since there was no safe place to clamp on the aorta.  At
this point, it was elected to do the left internal mammary
artery to left anterior superior descending artery bypass off
pump.  See operative note for full details.  Post operatively he
was extubated and epinephrine was slowly weaned.  He went into
rapid atrial fibrillation on POD#1 and dropped his systolic
blood pressure into the 70's.  He was cardioverted x 3 with
200/360/360 Joules and converted to sinus rhythm.  He was weaned
from all vasoactive medications over the next 3 days and was
hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm.  He did have post
operative acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.0 and
this was decreasing at the time of discharge.  He was started on
Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and received 2 doses
of 5 mg and INR went to 4.8.  He was resumed with Coumadin at a
lower dose and INR was therapurtic at the time of discharge.  He
was evaluated by physical therapy for strength and mobility and
cleared for home.  He was transferred to the step down floor on
post operative day 5.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed
per cardiac surgery protocol.  He was tolerating a full oral
diet, ambulating with assistance and his wounds were healing
well.  It was felt that he was safe for discharge home with
services on POD # 8.  The patient will be advised to follow up
with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks and at that time discuss Corevalve
options for aortic stenosis. All follow up appointments were
advised.
