SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient states that she lives in

heart rate 96, blood pressure 157/63, oxygen saturation 97%
on 2 liters.  Current physical exam temperature 99.1, pulse
93, blood pressure 140/80, oxygen saturation 94% on 3 liters.
HEENT: oropharynx moist.  Chest: trace crackles at the left
base, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no
murmur.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, positive

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 18, hematocrit 41.4,
platelets 307.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.3, chloride 84, CO2
52, BUN 12, creatinine 0.5.  In 7/00 cardiac echo normal left
ventricular systolic function, normal wall motion.  On
[**2101-10-25**] chest x-ray increased lung volume, flat diaphragm,
infiltrates in lower lobe.  On [**10-28**] chest x-ray small
bilateral pleural effusions with patchy consolidation of the
left base.  On [**2101-10-28**] white blood cells 13.8, hemoglobin and
hematocrit 11.5 and 36.2, platelets 290.  Sodium 138,
potassium 3.7, chloride 95, bicarbonate 36, BUN 13,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 113.  Calcium 8.6, phosphate 2.5,
magnesium 1.8.  Arterial blood gas on 5 liters of O2 per
minute was 7.38/59/98.  On [**10-31**] white blood cell count 13.5
(patient on steroids), hemoglobin and hematocrit 12.1 and
38.4, platelets 347.  Sodium 131, potassium 4.2, chloride 88,
CO2 40, BUN 19, creatinine 0.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a woman with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbated by pneumonia and
intubated for respiratory failure.  In the medical ICU she
was started on Solu-Medrol 40 mg IV t.i.d., Atrovent and
albuterol nebulizers.  The patient's sputum showed gram
negative rods and she was empirically started on ceftazidime.
She received 2 gm of Ceftaz, followed by 5 gm of 1 gm
ceftriaxone IV q.24 hours and then was switched to 500 mg
p.o. q.d. of levofloxacin on [**10-31**] for a seven day course of
levofloxacin.  She was not febrile during this admission.
She was still complaining of an occasional cough.  Ventilator
dependence was minimal and she was extubated without
complications on [**10-26**].  Intravenous steroids were
stopped on [**10-28**] and she was started on prednisone taper 60 mg
q.d.  On day of discharge, [**11-1**], it was the first day of
prednisone 30 mg q.d.  She was on 2 liters of nasal prong
oxygen at home and this is what she was receiving at
discharge.

The patient was often confused, belligerent and anxious, but
this apparently is her baseline.  She complained of
occasional headache.  She has a history of chronic headaches
for which she receives Darvon (propoxyphene) 65 mg q.four
hours p.r.n. and this was restarted.  On discharge the
patient had crackles to 1/3 up the lungs, but she did not
have rales nor stigmata of congestive heart failure.  Given
her pneumonia, these crackles make take a fair amount of time
to resolve even if the active infection has already cleared.

Regarding her labs, sodium was around 130.  She has a history
of SIADH secondary to lung disease and at times in the past
has been on oral salt tablets 500 mg three times a day.
Because her sodium has been stable here off sodium tablets,
they were not restarted.  CO2 was high at around 40, but
looking at her past discharge summaries, this appears to be
her baseline.  She is likely CO2 retaining from COPD.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d., last dose [**2101-11-6**].
2.  Darvon (propoxyphene) 65 mg p.o. q.four p.r.n. headache.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Klonopin 0.5 mg in a.m., 1 mg in p.m.
5.  Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Lactulose syrup one to three tablespoons b.i.d. p.r.n.
constipation.
7.  Atrovent inhaler two puffs t.i.d.
8.  Albuterol inhaler one puff b.i.d.
9.  Prednisone taper [**11-1**] to 9/36 30 mg p.o. q.d., [**11-3**] to
[**11-4**] 20 mg p.o. q.d., [**11-5**] to [**11-6**] 10 mg p.o. q.d., [**11-7**] to
[**11-8**] 5 mg p.o. q.d., [**11-9**] off prednisone.
