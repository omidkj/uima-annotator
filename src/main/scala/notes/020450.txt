*******************

EKG: Atrial fibrillation, rate 118 bpm. Axis indeterminate, low
voltages in limb leads. Wide QRS complex, LBBB.

[**2180-2-5**] 10:48AM CXR: Comparison made with the prior chest x-ray
of [**2-1**]. This one was taken in the supine position. A
moderate to large left effusion is present. The left lower lobe
cannot be seen and an infiltrate in this area cannot be
excluded. The right chest appears clear. There may be a smaller
posterior right effusion.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of failure and left lower lobe infiltrate
cannot be excluded.

[**2179-11-10**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with prominent free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
a diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Dilated ascending aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30207**] was initially admitted to the Vascular surgery service
on [**2180-1-31**] with a diagnosis of PVD and right foot cellulitis,
empirically started on Linezolid (history of VRE and MRSA).
Levaquin was added on [**2180-2-1**]. Of note, diuretics were held on
admission in anticipation for angiography. A RLE angio was
performed on [**2180-2-1**], which revealed focal areas of stenosis in
the superficial femoral artery and right popliteal arteries,
occluded AT and PT and stenosed peroneal artery. After
discussion with the patient, decision was eventually taken to
proceed with right BKA, which he underwent on [**2180-2-4**].

He was extubated in the PACU on [**2180-2-4**] at night. Following
extubation, he had transient hypotension, and was transfused 2
units of PRBCs post-operatively with resolution of hypotension.
On [**2180-2-5**], his BP was noted to be trending down, with
decreasing U/O, and patient given IVF total of 2250 cc (NS +
LR). A Swan Ganz catheter was placed, with initial numbers CVP
29, PA 62/30, PCWP 23, SVR 843, CO/CI 3.3/1.54, MV02 58%, PaO2
94%. A Dopamine drip was subsequently started given ongoing
hypotension, and Lasix 40 mg IV was given for increasing
respiratory distress, then 80 mg IV X 1. CXR with CHF. He was
intubated for increasing respiratory distress and somnolence,
with ABG 7.26/58/94 --> 7.25/55/56 on 100% face mask prior to
intubation. Given low cardiac output, Milrinone was transiently
started for inotropic support, stopped because of hypotension.
He was transferred to the CCU for further management, on
Dopamine drip.

Upon arrival to the CCU, Mr. [**Known lastname 30207**] had repeated episodes of VT.
Amiodarone bolus 300 mg IV was given, followed by a drip, with
successful conversion to his baseline rhythm in atrial
fibrillation with rate 70-80s. He was briefly started on a
Milrinone drip. He was continued on Dopamine drip, with addition
of Levophed for pressure support.

His subsequent Swan Ganz numbers were increasingly suggestive of
septic shock with low SVR, normal to high CO/CI, with a possible
component of cardiogenic shock with probable peri-operative MI
given rising CK and troponin. He was continued on pressors, and
antibiotic coverage was broadened to include Levaquin,
Clindamycin, Ceftazidime
