CHIEF COMPLAINT:  80 year old male with vague abdominal
complaints.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year old male with
a past medical history significant for dementia, though mild,
who presents with vague complaint of abdominal and chest
discomfort.  The patient was unable to provide a clear or
full history, but at the time of the interview stated that he
had problems for a couple of weeks in terms of belly pain and
unable to distinguish between diarrhea and constipation at
the time of admission.  He says that he has had a bowel
movement on the day of admission, but also notes that he has
some vague chest discomfort at baseline, two to three times a
week.  At the time of admission, denied any abdominal
discomfort, shortness of breath or palpitations.

four liters.  Generally speaking, in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Small OM clear.  Mucous membranes dry.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 positive.  No
murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally with bilateral crackles, no wheezes.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended; 5 cm mass in right lower

hematocrit of 41.6, platelets of 341,000, sodium of 144,
potassium of 4.0, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 24, BUN 19,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 123.  Normal liver function tests,
total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.  INR is 0.8,
negative troponin and CKs.

Chest x-ray was negative at time of presentation.  An EKG on
presentation was sinus at 103 with multiple premature atrial
contractions, normal axis, baseline left bundle branch block,
T wave inversions in I; no change on comparison to
[**2196-11-25**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Service where he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
He was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation.  Ultimately,
the patient had a CT scan that revealed a right lower
quadrant mass and ultimately was seen by Surgery on the 31st,
that recommended GI and Cardiology consults for evaluation as
well as NPO and NG tube decompression.  The patient continued
to be decompressed for several days with only complaints of
nausea and abdominal discomfort.

Ultimately, the patient was seen by Gastroenterology that
recommended the same NG suction and observation for potential
procedure in the future.  The patient again continued to be
decompressed for several days.  Ultimately on the [**1-17**], the patient pulled out his NG tube and while doing
that had an episode of what appears to be aspiration.
Ultimately, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], intubated secondary to hypoxic
respiratory distress, and for likely aspiration pneumonia.
The patient had a Swan placed and was hypotensive,
transiently on Dopamine, ultimately on Levophed and
vasopressor that were both weaned off within three days.

The patient was put on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient with right upper lobe pneumonia and left lower
lobe pneumonia that are gradually increasing rather than
improving.  He has been continued on his Amiodarone drip for
atrial fibrillation since p.o. load has been impossible.  The
patient was afebrile after weaning off his pressors on the
[**1-22**], continued to be afebrile until the 10th, at
which point he spiked a fever to 101.0 F.

The patient had five sputum cultures grow out MRSA which
correlated with the Gram stain and also had a right IJ that
was discontinued that grew out MRSA from a blood culture
drawn from the central line.  The patient had an NG tube
changed to an OG tube on the 11th.  His cordis was removed
and the patient had a quadruple lumen put in its place.  The
first Swan numbers revealed a PA pressure of 42/20, a wedge
of 15 to 22, a CVP of 13 to 15, cardiac output of 5.13 and
SVR of 920.  Initially, his SVR was 360, cardiac output in
the 6 range and a wedge around 8.

After repletion, his cardiac output and his wedge improved,
and the patient appeared to be improving until the fever
spike, at which point he became more distressed in terms of
his respiratory status, requiring increasing ventilations and
ultimately going from SIMV and pressure support to assist
control ventilation at 630 by 20 with an FIO2 of 55%.
Arterial blood gases revealed a pH of 7.3, 45, 40, with
correction by the change in the ventilator.

Ultimately, the family decided that they wanted the patient
transferred to the [**Hospital6 1708**] for
evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8635**].  Based on this, the decision
has been made to transfer the patient.

SYSTEM BY SYSTEM PROBLEM LIST:
1.      [**Name2 (NI) 24763**]lar:  The patient, prior to having his
surgery planned, had a MIBI that revealed reversibility and
also an echocardiogram that revealed a depressed ejection
fraction in the 25 to 30% range.  The patient ultimately
continued to be in atrial fibrillation, was loaded on
amiodarone intravenous.  Because of his obstruction and
uncle[**Name (NI) **] obstruction, Cardiology here felt that he should
continue his drip at 0.5 mg per hour.  Otherwise, the patient
has been hemodynamically stable since weaned off pressors
from the septic physiology that he was displaying.

2.      Infectious Disease:  The patient with right upper
lobe, left lower lobe Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia.  Also, with new left pleural effusion,
increasing white count, ongoing fevers and increasing
respiratory distress.  Plan should be to continue
antibiotics, specifically Vancomycin.  Consider further
addition of Rifampin if the patient's clinical situation
continues to worsen.  Plan should also include a tap of the
patient's left pleural space to rule out empyema in case the
patient needs a chest tube.  This was planned at the [**Hospital1 18**]
for today, but given transfer, should be done at his new
location.  No other positive cultures for now.

3.      Pulmonary:  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia and congestive heart failure.  Continuing
antibiotics.  He is currently day 11 of all of his
antibiotics.  Based on his worsening clinical scenario, we
have switched him from SIMV to assist-control.  He is
currently on assist-control 630 by 20, with FIO2 of 55%.  We
also initiated diuresis today with 40 mg of intravenous
Lasix.

4.      Renal Function:  Stable; follow BUN and creatinine.

5.      Gastrointestinal:  The patient with an obstructing
mass in his right cecum.  Will print out reports for you of
CT scan.  Would consider surgery if more stable.  The patient
felt not to be a surgical candidate at the time of this
dictation.

[**Doctor Last Name **] goal for the day of one liter negative.  Electrolytes are
stable.  Will forward a copy of his electrolytes.

CODE STATUS:    Code status is Full Code.

PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient is on:
1.  Protonix 40 twice a day.
2.  On pneumoboots.

HEME:  The patient with low platelets on heparin.  Heparin
induced thrombocytopenia antibody pending.  With
discontinuation of heparin, the patient returned his platelet
count to normal.

NOTE:  The patient should not be given any heparin
subcutaneously, intravenous or in flushes.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged to the [**Hospital6 1708**]
under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8635**].
