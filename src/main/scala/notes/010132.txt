Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, Dyspnea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
48 year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%) s/p ICD in
[**2117**], HTN, CKD (baseline Cr 1.3-1.6) and asthma p/w chronic
cough, abdominal pain and n/v, unable to take POs.
.
The pt has had a cough, productive of white sputum for the past
2mos, as well as weight gain being managed in Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] HF
telemedicine clinic. His lisinopril was changed to losartan out
of concern for cough, and last week his torsemide was increased
to 100mg daily to further managed his HF. He also notes DOE and
orthopnea and ten lb weight gain over the past week and 20 lbs
over the month despite increasing doses of diuretics. In
addition to the increased DOE he has had cough which is
increasing. He has also had vomitting after bouts of coughing.
Because the coughing has been persistent it has been difficult
to take his PO meds. He states that the vommiting has been
mostly in the context of coughing but not always. Additionally
his son has had n/v/d symptoms over the last couple days as
well.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 95.9 105 143/74 22 100%RA. The pt was
found to have K+ 3.1, Cr 1.5, BNP 7000s, INR 2.4, trop <0.01.
CXR showed no significant interval change. Persistent
cardiomegaly, without
overt pulmonary edema. CT ab non con showed no acute process. He
was treated with KCL 60meq PO, morphine 4mg IV,zofran,
promethazine, and torsemide 100mg IVx1.

STUDIES:
CXR:
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Single lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending
to the expected position of the right ventricle. Moderate
cardiomegaly persists. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. No focal
consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
seen.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change. Persistent
cardiomegaly, without overt pulmonary edema.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:
The lungs are clear. A pacemaker device is seen ending in the
right
ventricle. The heart is enlarged. There are no focal hepatic
lesions. The
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
normal. There is no evidence of obstructing renal stones or
renal masses. There are only mild atherosclerotic calcifications
of the iliac arteries.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There
is no free air and no free fluid. The small and large bowel
including the appendix are normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS:
The urinary bladder is normal. There is no pelvic
lymphadenopathy or pelvic free fluid.
BONES: There are no significant degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION: No acute CT findings in the abdomen or pelvis.

Radiology Report ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2120-1-31**]
7:06 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal pathology.
2. Cardiomegaly.

Radiology Report DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2120-2-3**] 2:59
PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature. Exaggeration of phasicity in the
portal
venous waveform may correspond to the provided history of
congestive heart
disease.

2. Echogenic liver (borderline), suggestive of fatty
infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease, including more significant hepatic
fibrosis or
cirrhosis, cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
No focal
liver lesions identified.

Radiology Report	CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2120-2-5**]
10:14 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-22**] and 30:
Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vasculature is
unremarkable, lungs
are clear and there is no pneumothorax. Transvenous right
ventricular pacer
defibrillator lead is in standard position, unchanged.

Cardiovascular Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2120-2-8**]  10:46:54 AM
Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V conduction delay. Possible
left atrial
abnormality. Prolonged Q-T interval. Rightward axis.
Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific
inferolateral T wave flattening. Low QRS voltage in the limb
leads. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2120-1-29**] the ventricular premature
beats are absent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Patient is a 48 year-old man
with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%) with 5 admissions this
year, s/p ICD in [**2117**], HTN, CKD (baseline Cr 1.3-1.6) and
asthma, who presented with cough, n/v, most likely from acute on
chronic CHF. Due to the worsening nausea and vomiting, patient
was unable to take his diuretic medications, leading to
worsening of the volume overload with gut edema. He was diuresed
in-house to close to dry weight with resolution of nausea and
vomiting and improvement in coughing. IV Lasix drip with
milrinone was used for diuresis initially but patient was
transitioned to oral diuretics on disc
