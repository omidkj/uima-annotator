Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-2-5**] - Redo Sternotomy, AVR (21 CE magna tisuue),CABGx3
[**2199-1-29**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
70M with CAD s/p CABGx2v [**9-17**], PCI with [**Month/Year (2) **] to distal LCx [**9-23**],
PAF, RHD s/p bioprosthetic AVR and MVR, HIV admitted with chest
pain and palpitations.

The patient was in his usual state of health until the day of
presentation when he developed a rapid pulse/palpitations. The
onset was sudden and was soon followed by a sharp pain in his
left chest which radiated down his left inner arm. He states
that it is similar to his prior anginal experiences, although
more intense and more significant CP component. He endorses left
upper back pain, diaphoresis, palpitations and rapid pulse. He
denies lightheadedness or nausea. He took 2 SL NTG without
relief. He called EMS.
.
EMS arrived and gave an additional 3 NTG sprays without relief
and aspirin.
.
In the ED, the vitals were 99.2, ?84, 133/93, 100RA. The patient
went into atrial fibrillation with RVR. He had metoprolol 5mg IV
x3 and 50mg PO metoprolol. The chest pain resolved with
conversion to NSR. Laboratory data was significant for first set
of CE were negative. EKG with atrial tachycardia with
ventricular rates of 120s. The patient had lateral ST depression
in V5-V6, I, II.ST depressions persisted after rhythm converted
to NSR. CXR 1V reportedly unremarkable. Given persistent left
back pain despite improved chest pain, CTA chest performed; on
preliminary read, no evidence of dissection. Received total
morphine 8mg IV, 1 additional SLNTG; also, at recommendation of
cardiology fellows, was started on heparin gtt. On transfer to
the medicine service, 70, 120/63, 17, 99%2L NC.
.
Of note, seen in his cardiologist's office on [**2199-1-24**] for
exertional angina (with walking). Given lack of relief with
Imdur, patient was started on Nitro-patch 0.4 mg per hour for 12
hours every day. In addition, Lipitor was restarted at 20 mg
every other day.

Minimal bilateral ICA calcific plaque, no appreciable associated

stenosis (graded as less than 40% bilaterally).

[**2199-1-29**] - Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated native three vessel coronary artery disease.  The
LMCA had
an ostial 30% , proximal 30% and diffuse disease throughout with
heavy
calcification leading to 80% stenosis before a complex
bifurcation with
D1 adn D1.  There was moderate stenosis of the origin of S1.  D1
was
heavily calcified with a proximal 75% stenosis which was similar
to the
previous cath.  The was mild diffuse disease in the mid to
distal LAD.
The LCX had diffuse disease in the AV groove CX with patent [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 22595**].  The previously large and grafted OM remains occluded
with
scant filling via left-left collaterals.  The RCA was difficult
to
engage with a JR4, AR1, AR2 as all these catheters selectively
intubated
the RV/conus branch and the brachiocephalic artery.  Ultimately
a 5
French AL1 deep-seated the artery with a 20-30 mm Hg gradient
down the
vessel indicating a moderate RCA stenosis likely of 50% in size
which
was however not visualized.  The RPDA was diffusely diseased
with a
stenosis at the origin of 60% and a mid stump of the prior SVG.
There
were patent lateral branches arising off the RPDA with faint
collaterals
to the LAD.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated right and left
ventricular
enddiastolic pressure of 16 and 21 mm Hg, respectively.  The
mean PA
pressure was 36 mmHg (phasic 60/23 mm Hg; pulmonary vascular
resistance
157 dynes/sec/cm-5).  The PCW was 22 mm Hg.  The cardiac index
was
preserved at 3.1 L/min/m2.  The mean systemic arterial blood
pressure
was 75 mmHg (phasic 111/51 mm Hg).
3.  There was a mean aortic valve gradient of 33 mm Hg
calculating to an
aortic valve area of 1.3 cm2 using an assumed oxygen consumption
of 125
mL/min/m2 to calculate cardiac output according to the Fick
principle.

[**2199-1-28**] ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets appear normal, but the transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-8-7**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. The
aortic and mitral valve gradients are similar.

PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.

There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities in the
anteroseptal wall.. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF=45 % to 50%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (are
