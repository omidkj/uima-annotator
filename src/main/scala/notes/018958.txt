Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 93746**] is a 51 yo gentleman with Down Syndrome and chronic
Hep B s/p posterior cervical laminectomy on [**2108-7-11**] for severe
spondylotic cervical stenosis causing LE weakness and pain.  The
cervical stenosis came to medical attention after a fall in late
[**2108-6-7**].  Since spinal surgery earlier this month he has had
repeated UTI's.  He has been staying at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab Facility
for Aged since his discharge on [**2108-7-19**].  He started having
mental status changes approx 48 hours ago; patient was becoming
increasingly somnolent.  His temperature spiked to 102.0 earlier
today.  His foley was replaced at the rehab facility, but
apparently it was a traumatic foley replacement because ED notes
blood in bag.

ED sent urine and blood cultures prior to starting empiric ABX.
The patient's SBP dropped to 60s.  He received 4-5 liters of
crystalloid in the ED and he was started on levofed and
dopamine.  A right femoral line was placed for access. He is
being admitted to the ICU with concern for urosepsis.

Past Medical History:
- chronic hep B - on adefovir and lamivudine, no known cirrhosis

- trisomy 21
- rosacea
- Right eye blindness - [**3-10**] retinal detachment
- Right cataract
- eczema
- Cholelithiasis

Social History:
Was staying at rehab facility after recent discharge [**7-19**].
Sister is health care proxy.

General: well-nourished, unresponsive to command and noxious
stimulus.  rhythmic breathing with series of 2 breath
ihalations.

sternal border, no rubs/gallops. JVP at 8 cm above sternal
angle.  2 + radial pulses bilat.
Lungs: CTAB anteriorly
ABD: + BS, soft, nd, nt, no masses,
Ext: right femoral line in place, hands and feet cool, capillary
refill ~ 5 sec. mild bilat tibial edema.
GU: triple lumen foley in place
Neuro: unresponsive to command or pain. not moving extremeties


Pertinent Results:
URINE and BLOOD CX positive for Proteus Mirablis, which was
pan-sensitive.

TTE [**2108-8-9**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Moderately depressed and dilated right ventricle with estimated
moderate pulmonary hypertension. No vegetations identified. If
clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo man with Down's syndrome, severe cervical stenosis s/p
laminectomy who was admitted from rehab for altered mental
status, acute renal failure, and GNR sepsis.

1) GNR septicemia and bacteremia:  blood and urine cultures on
admission grew Proteus, pan sensitive.  He was treated with IV
fluids, pressors to support his blood pressure and broad
spectrum antibiotics.   It was initially difficult to wean off
pressors with his systolic blood pressure frequently dropping
into the 70s.  He is now hemodynamically stable, off pressors
and has been transitioned from cefepime to po ciprofloxacin per
sensitivies to complete a 14 day course (last day [**8-20**]/).  It
appears that his baseline SBP is in the upper 80-low 90s -
mentates well with good UOP at these pressures and has ranged as
high as the 110s on the floor prior to discharge.

2) Acute renal failure:  His acute renal failure was thought to
be pre-renal in origin. His creatinine quickly returned to
baseline after fluid repletion.  He was noted to have an
adequate urine output throughout his hospital stay even at
low-normal BPs.

3) Altered mental status: secondary to septicemia, now resolved.
 Able to answers simple questions and engages well with
medical/nursing staff.  Sister HCP reports he is back to
baseline.

4) Mild depressed systolic function on TTE:  no known prior
cardiac history.  Suspect may be related to sepsis.  Recommend
nonurgent outpt TTE to f/u in [**3-11**] months.

5) Cervical stenosis s/p laminectomy: the patient has minimal
strength in upper extremities and has not moved his lower
extremities spontaneously since his surgery. This is his
baseline, as confirmed with neurosurgery. He is to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] six weeks after his surgery, which will be the
week of [**8-20**]; Dr.[**Name (NI) 2845**] office will contact the rehab facility
with the appointment date and time, if this is still necessary.

6) Chronic Hep B: His outpatient Hep B medications were held for
2 days, and were restarted once his renal function returned to
[**Location 213**].

7) ?Chronic urinary retention: Indwelling foley catheter was
changed twice during ICU stay. Consider nonurgent outpatient
urological consultation for evaluation for possible antibiotic
prophylaxis against recurrent UTI.

8) RUE swelling: noted on day of discharge in the arm where
midline was placed. Midline was removed since IV antibiotics not
required. Skin warm, good radial pulse, patient reported
intermittent tenderness. IV nurse evaluated when midline was
pulled and no concern for UE DVT, recommended elevation.
