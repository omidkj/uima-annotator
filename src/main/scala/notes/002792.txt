History of Present Illness:
77 year old female with h/o COPD on 2L nc, hypercarbic resp
failure, HTN, pulmonary nodules who was found to be unresponsive
at her nursing home.
.
Per NH records and ED report, patient found to be at her normal
baseline status (A&Ox3) around 5pm.  Approx 15-30min later, she
was found to be unresponsive, and EMS was called.  Her VS at the
time were: BP 120/60, HR 100, RR 22, 82% on 15L, FS 190. Labs
from NH [**2-10**]: UA neg ket/nit/leuk/wbc/prot, Na 145, K 4.5, CO2
45, BUN 14, Cr 0.4, Ca 9.3, Glu 81, wbc 3.8, hgb 8.5.  Of note,
per nursing home records, she is on xanax standing and trazadone
prn for anxiety.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 92.7 100 86/37 90% 10L.  Her SBP ranged
70s-200s.  Per ED report, dropped w/ propofol and fentanyl,
improved with holding of sedations.   Her pupils were thought to
be minimally reactive with some weakness on the left, so a code
stroke was called.  CTA head/neck prelim negative.  CXR
hyperinflated w/o evidence of pna/effusions.  She was intubated
in the ED given worsening AMS.  There was question of jaw
[**Last Name (LF) 110199**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given ativan for possible seizure.  Her
labs in the ED were notable for Na 150, BUN/Cr 25/0.6, K 5, HCO2
>50, WBC 13.6 (85% PMN, 2% bands), trop < 0.01; UA neg
wbc/leuk/nit, pos prot, pos granular casts; lactate 2.2.  On the
vent, her ABG was: 7.34/78/501.  She has 2piv's, vent settings:
fio2 30%, tv 400, r18.
.
Currently, patient is awake and responsive; she denies pain,
history of cough, diarrhea, dysuria, fevers.

Imaging:
[**2169-2-16**] CXR- Endotracheal tube 2.5 cm from the carina. Linear
parenchymal
opacities in the right upper lung, potentially chronic; however,
followup of this region recommended on future exams.
.
[**2169-2-16**] CTA head and neck-
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Generalized parenchymal atrophy with changes of chronic small
vessel
ischemic disease.
3. Confluent hypodensity in the central pons likely represents
additional
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, given the
such findings in other typical locations. However, possiblity of
osmotic myelinolysis ("central pontine myelinolysis") cannot be
excluded entirely, in the appropriate clinical context.
4. Tiny, 2 mm aneurysm arising from the proximal portion of the
right
posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
5. Unremarkable CTA of the neck.
6. Prominence of superior ophthalmic veins in both orbits,
likely varices.
7. Severe emphysematous changes in the visualized lung apices
with
ill-defined nodular opacities in the right upper lobe.
Comparison with
previous (outside) cross-sectional studies, if available, is
advised.
.
[**2169-2-17**] CTA chest-
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus with suboptimal
opacification of the
left lower lobe subsegmental arteries where there is scarring;
therefore,
pulmonary embolus cannot be excluded in this region.
2. Severe emphysema.
3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
.
TTE [**2-21**]- The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
valve prolapse is present. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.
.
CXR [**3-2**]- As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change. Large lung volumes, moderate cardiomegaly
without pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
effusions. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
