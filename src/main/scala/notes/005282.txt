History of Present Illness:
79 yo male with PMH of CAD s/p stents in [**2170**] and EF 21% in
[**2174**].  Came in after telling PCP that systolic was 70s this am,
who wanted him to present to the ED.  He keeps a chart of his
daily blood pressures, which have ranged 80s to 90s systolic
(long term baseline) until yesterday, when it was 74/43 and
today at 73/43.  He is completely asymptomatic and specifically
denies LH, SOB, CP, palpitations, F/C, abd pain.  He reports
that his UOP has been down and his urine has been darker.  He
has intentionally limited his fluid intake per his
cardiologist's recommendations, but that has been over the
course of months.  He endorses thirst.
.
He had a recent admission at [**Hospital **] hospital for UGIB with
gastric ulcers.  He was placed on a PPI.  On [**4-8**], his BUN/Cr
was 51/1.9.  he was given 2U pRBCs with discharge HCT 30.  An
abdominal u/s noted small to moderate acites in the upper
abdomen.
.
He has also undergone 2 mechanical falls in the last month.  He
has residual left knee pain/swelling and left leg echymosis.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 97.1  57  68/47  18  89%RA. He was
given a 350cc of gentle fluid.  Surgery was consulted and they
are following.  His stool was guaiac positive and melenotic.  GI
was consulted, but have not seen him yet.  He had a CT pelvis
showing ascites with no other abnormalities.  Bedside echo
showed no effusion.  He had a LE u/s because of asymmetry in his
legs which showed no DVT.  No CTA was done because of his renal
failure.  Before transfer to the floor, VS were 75/54 48 100%
2L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he is still asymptomatic.  His systolic
BP is in the 80s.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2179-4-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
without evidence of pulmonary edema. Findings are concerning for
a pericardial effusion or early cardiac decompensation. Findings
discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11084**] at the time of
interpretation.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**4-21**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-4-18**], the
degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have slightly
decreased.

[**4-22**] Foot Xray: No localizing history is available. There is
mild diffuse osteopenia. There is probable mild soft tissue
swelling along the dorsum of the foot. No fracture or
dislocation is detected. Recommend correlation with specific
site of symptoms for full assessment.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo with PMH of CAD p/w acute on chronic heart failure
biventricular with EF 20%.
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Biventricular HEART
FAILURE: Patient was started on lasix gtt but was hypotensive
and had low UO. An IJ was placed and he was started on milranone
and phenylephrine. He diuresed well and his BP improved to his
baseline which in 80s/50s.  He was weaned off the pressors but
kept on the lasix gtt with good diureses. He was net 10L
negative. His repeat echo showed overall improvement in MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]R but EF unchanged. His symptoms improved and he was able to be
weaned off oxygen. He was discharged on 40mg torsemide daily.

# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: FeUREA suggests pre-renal etiology which
is likely poor forward from heart failure, improved wih
diureses.
.
# GIB/Ulcers: Hct stable. Cont PPI, Restarted on 81mg ASA given
stability
.
# CAD: Cont ASA, statin
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Mild and stable throughout admission
.
# LLE injury: [**3-15**] to falls. Knee has effusion and is
erythematous. Joint tap negative. Afebrile without leukocytosis.
R foot painful with ambulation but improved with tylenol. Cont
cephalexin to complete 10 days course. R foot plain films were
negative for fracture. Follow PT recs for PT eval at home for
safety. Discontinued ambien as he had sundowning in the hospital
and ambien certainly was worsening disorientation.
.
# General Care: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac diet,
Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI, Access: 2 18G PIVs, PICC (d/ced
