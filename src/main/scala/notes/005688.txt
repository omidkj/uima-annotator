History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 38975**] is a 67 yo male with severe COPD, s/p recent
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation [**Date range (1) 38976**], cancer of the
layrnx and prostate status post xrt who is admitted with
hypercarbic respiratory failure [**12-24**] COPD exacerbation.
.
He was in his usual state of health since his last admission and
had been weaning his prednisone over 4 weeks.  He was down from
40 mg daily to 30 with a plan to decrease to 20 mg tomorrow.
However, over the last week, he became more dyspneic with
exertion with increased sputum production.  He is normally
sedentary but is able to bath himself without help (though has
dyspnea when this is completed) and walk from his chair across
the room.  Over the last few days, he was unable to talk in
complete sentences and was more dyspneic with any movement.  He
had an appointment with his outpatient pulmonologist today who
sent him to the ED for evaluation.
.
He additionally reports several loose bowel movements a day for
the last 3 days associated wtih mild abdominal cramping.  This
is not particularly bothersome and he does not have any
abdominal cramping at [**Last Name (un) **] time. .

In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.8 HR 75 BP 100/73 RR 16 O2SAT:
93% 4L.  He was noted to be tachypneic and unable to speak in
full sentences.  No ABG was done.  He was placed on BiPAP and
was noted to have improved symptoms.  CXR without new
infiltrate.  Given the chronicity ofhis symptoms over several
days, he was sent over to the ICU on 4L NC.  He was given
Vancomycin, Zosyn, Solumedrol 80 mg IV and combivent nebs x3
prior to transfer.
.
On the floor, the patient is able to answer questions but begins
to purse his lips and use accessory muscles to recover after
speaking.  He denies any other symptoms on review of systems
including chest pain, headaches, weakness, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, constipation, dysuria.  He does endorse urinary
hesitancy and frequency but this has been ongoing since his
prostate cancer xrt.
.

CXRAY ON [**2138-4-23**]:
PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There is marked
hyperexpansion of the lungs with upper lobe lucency and splaying
of
bronchovasculature, which is compatible with known severe
emphysema. There is vague opacity in the left lower lung between
the left eighth and ninth ribs posteriorly as well as at the
left lung base, which could represent small foci of scarring or
residual of infection in this patient with recent pneumonia. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact.

IMPRESSION: Severe emphysema. Residual infection versus scarring
in the leftlower lung.
.
CXRAY PORTABLE ON [**2138-4-24**]:
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

This examination is technically very limited. Only the upper
portion of the
thorax was included. Visualized portions of the lungs are clear.
The upper
mediastinum is unchanged.
.
EKG ON [**2138-4-23**]:
Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat. Consider left atrial
abnormality
although is non-diagnostic. Otherwise, tracing is within normal
limits.

.
Abdominal X-ray [**2138-4-26**]: Single AP supine portable radiograph was
submitted. There is stool throughout the colon. There is no
evidence of bowel obstruction or pathologic calcifications in
the abdomen. Degenerative changes are in the lumbar spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old M with a PMH significant for severe COPD on 4L home
oxygen, who presents with worsening shortness of breath and
productive cough as well as diarrhea.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening of chronic CO2
retention and respiratory acidosis in the setting of COPD
exacerbation requiring BiPAP. There was no clear clear
infiltrate on plain film.  The etiology was unclear though may
have been in the setting of prednisone taper over the last week.
He was continued on BiPap at night, which he found helpful.
.
# COPD exacerbation: Patient's dyspnea is most likely related to
COPD exacerbation and possibly exacerbated by prednisone taper
and changes in acid base status with diarrhea. Gold stage IV
COPD. He was treated with standing nebs and a slow prednisone
taper. He will continue his nebs at home. He was started on
steroids and was discharged on 60mg prednisone; he has pulmonary
follow up on the day after admission and will taper the steroids
according to his pulmonologists' instructions. He completed a 5
day course of azithromycin. Advair was continued.
.
# Diarrhea: C. diff negative x 2. Resolved with conservative
management. Unclear etiology.
.
# Anemia: Hct down from admission (39-36.8) though now closer to
baseline.  Normocytic in nature.  Iron studies, B12 and folate
wnl earlier this month.  He is having guaiac positive stools.
Hct remained stable throughout admission.
- Will likely need inpatient or outpatient GI consultation.
.
# Memory difficulties: continued donazepil.
.
# T1 Larynx Cancer: Patient is status post radiation therapy. No
current treatment.
.
# [**Doctor Last Name **] 8 Prostate Adenocarcinoma: Patient reports worsening
urinary symptoms, increased avodart as outpatient.
.
# Depression: continued prozac.

Medications on Admission:
