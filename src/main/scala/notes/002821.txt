Chief Complaint:
elective toe amputation and ulcer debridement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:

    foot.
2. Debridement of right lower extremity anterior ulcer.

PICC line Placement


History of Present Illness:
66 yo M with ESRD on HD, CHF, COPD and severe PVD originally
admitted for right 1st and 2nd toe amputation with pre-op
pneumonia, and post-op loculated pleural effusions and a fib
with RVR.
.
The patient initially was admitted to the [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] surgery
service for right 1st and 2nd toe amputations as well as right
lower leg ulcer debridement with VAC dressing placement on
[**2136-4-11**] On pre-op testing the patient was found to have a right
middle lobe pneumonia. Subsequent CT chest on [**2136-4-11**] revealed
bilateral loculated pleural effusions and pneumonia. He received
multiple antibiotics including nafcillin, clindamycin,
vancomycin and levofloxacin. The patient had a CT guided
thoracentesis with pigtail catheter placement on [**2136-4-13**].
Cultures on this fluid to date are without growth. Sputum
culture has growth only from [**2136-4-11**] with moraxella. The
patient was transitioned to vancomycin and zosyn and is now on
approximately day 6 of an expected 10 day course of zosyn
monotherapy.
.
On post-op day #2 the patient developed a fib with RVR with a
rate to the 130-150's. He developed hypotension to the systolic
70-80's and required transfer for the medical ICU. The patient
transiently required pressors. He was started on an amiodarone
load on [**2136-3-18**].
.
On the day of transfer from the ICU to the floor, the patient
underwent PICC line placement which failed and ended in midline
placement. He is scheduled to undergo revision by IR tomorrow.
In addition, he made his code status DNR/DNI by ICU team report.

.
Currently the patient complains of persistent shortness of
breath and lower extremity pain.
