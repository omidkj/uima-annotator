Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventillation
Right radial arterial line

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 107247**] is a 62 yo F PMH of afib, TIA, memory loss s/p
hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, asthma
recently admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage [**Date range (1) 107248**]
readmitted with acute change in mental status and agitation.
Since her discharge on [**2-17**] her husband reports that she had been
doing well until 2 days PTA when she was more fatigued and
agitated than usual. She did not have any specific complaints
but her husband reports development of diarrhea two days PTA
which he thinks was due to metformin being started. On the day
of admission, her husband was called by the nursing facility to
report that she was not waking up and she was sent to [**Hospital1 **]. Due to concern for possible repeat or progression of
intraparencymal bleed she was transferred here for neurosurgical
evaluation.
.
On arrival in the ED T100.8 BP 106/49 HR 64 RR 12 100% on 4L NC
FSBG 271. She was intubated on arrival in the ED due to
somnolence and concern that she would not be able to protect her
airway. She was given lidocaine 100mg IV, versed 2mg and
fentanyl 100mcg for sedation. She was given an additional 4mg IV
versed, started on versed gtt at 5mg/hour and fentanyl 100mcg
following this BP dropped to 76/palp. She was given 3L IVF and A
line was placed. She was also started on dopamine gtt at 2.5.
She had a LP without evidence of infection. Head CT was done
which was stable when compared to imaging from her recent
admission. There was no evidence of new or worsened bleed. She
was also given 10mg IV decadron, 2mg ceftriaxone. Dopamine gtt
was d/c'd prior tor transfer to the floor with BP 149/51.

.
[**2103-2-23**] Head CT: 1. Expected evolution of left medial temporal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with decreased intraventricular
blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
2. No new hemorrhage, herniation, hydrocephalus, or other acute
intracranial process.

[**2103-2-24**] MRI Head:
1. Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal
lobe without surrounding edema. Small amount of blood products
is also seen in the ventricles, which could be secondary to
extension of blood products from this abnormality. The
appearances are nonspecific, but given the location, primary
hemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like
cavernous malformation should be considered. Gadolinium-enhanced
MRI can help for further assessment.
2. Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be
seen in
patients with seizure and postictal stage. However, subtle
increased signal within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is
unusual for postictal status. This could reflect degenerative
changes within the pyramidal tract. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

[**2103-2-24**] MRA Head:
Slightly bulbous basilar artery without discrete aneurysm.
Otherwise, normal MRA of the head.

[**2103-2-24**] EEG:
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a
slow and disorganized background with increased slowing in the
left
hemisphere. This indicates a moderate encephalopathy with an
area of
subcortical dysfunction on the left. The former finding is most
often
caused by medication, metabolic disturbances, or infection.
There were
no epileptiform features noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 107247**] is a 62 yo F PMH of afib, TIA, memory loss s/p
hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, asthma
recently admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage [**Date range (1) 107248**]
readmitted with acute change in mental status and agitation
intubated in the ED for airway protection.  Her hospital course
is as follows:
.
# Agitation/altered mental status: Was initially unclear what
caused alteration in her mental status.  At baseline she has an
odd affect and is intermittently confused.  She was afebrile and
did not have any evidence of infection.  LP was performed and
was unremarkable.  Neurology was consulted.  EEG was performed
and was negative for seizure, only with slowing near the area of
her bleed.  CT scan showed her old stable bleed.  Her blood
sugar was normal.  MRI showed a bulbous basilar artery but
otherwise was unremarkable for a cause of her symptoms.
Psychoactive medications were held.  We continued her keppra at
current dose.  Her confusion returned to baseline during the
course of her admission.  Her altered mental status was likely
multifactorial to include medications, as well as her
hypercarbia, OSA/COPD (see below).  She should follow up with
neurology/neurosurgery as an outpatient.
.
# Hypercarbia/COPD/OSA: She was initially admitted intubated,
but was extubated after 24 hrs.  ABG showed mild hypoxemia with
p02 in the 50s-60s as well as significant hypercarbia, with pC02
in the 80s-90s, occationally in the 100s.  CXR was unremarkable
for infection.  We continued her bronchodilators.  During her
admission she had periods of somnolence possibly due to
increased carbon dioxide retention in the setting of untreated
OSA.  She was tried on autoset CPAP initially however this was
not effective for her.  She was briefly sent to the floor but
readmitted to the MICU after increased somnolence.  Sleep was
finally consulted.  She had an inpatient sleep study which
established BIPAP settings for her.  She will require follow up
sleep study and titration as an outpatient.  She continued to be
delirious with periods of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] agitation.
According to her husband, her mental status prior to her
discharge was similar to her baseline.  AutoSet BiPAP setting:
--Emin=8cm Imax=20cm max I-E gap 10cm at night for now (can be
ordered through [**Hospital 6549**] Medical - the contact there is
[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Name (NI) 6549**] Medical, cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 49797**])
--Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107249**] to arrange follow-up with sleep to
arrange formal outpatient BiPAP titration to further tailor
settings in the future
.
# Recent Left temporal hemorrhage: Was stable on CT and MRI.  We
continued her keppra and held her coumadin and plavix.
