s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F wtih hx of HTN, afib on coumadin, dementia and CHF
presents s/p unwitnessed fall at home ([**Location (un) 52925**]). Was seen
at [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital and had CT scan showing IPH and transferred
here for further neuro eval. Per the patient, she was washing
her bathroom floor, when she felt a little unsteady and just
fell. Doesn't remember chest pain, shortness of breath,
dizziness or any other precipitating factors. After talking with
staff at her residence, she apparently was found in the bathroom
bleeding this morning. She had not pressed her life button. It
was unclear what time she had fallen or for how long she was
down. She is demented at baseline and has been getting worse
over the last year, having increasing angry spells. She is
unsteady and supposed to use a walker, but she does not use it
in her apartment. She has not had any signs of infection or
change in her health recently.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were T 98.2, HR 70, BP 144/76, pox
100%. At the OSH, she had received 10 mg Vit K and a tetanus
shot. In our ED, he received activated factor 9 (Profilnine 1800
u) and 1u FFP.
.
On the floor, she denies any pain. She is alert and pleasant but
oriented only x1 (to self). She seems to remember what happened
today, but tries to change the subject when she can't answer
questions. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, weakness, headaches, vision changes,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, dysuria or bowel changes.

CT Head [**2193-8-30**]
1. Stable right frontal and left temporal intraparenchymal
hemorrhages. These
findings are most comptible with amyloid angiopathy though
underlying lesions
cannot be excluded. Recommend MRI to further assess.
2. No new areas of hemorrhage. No midline shift. No change in
the size of
the ventricles.
3. Parenchymal atrophy and chronic small vessel white matter
changes.

Hip X-ray [**2193-8-30**]:
IMPRESSION: No fractures. Left hip fixation without hardware
failure.

CXR [**2193-8-30**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, but no acute cardiopulmonary
process.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with hx of dementia, afib on coumadin, HTN and CHF who
presented after unwitnessed fall at home now w/IPH.
.
# IPH - Patient had one CT scan at the OSH and one in ED that
showed stable IPH in the R frontal lobe and L temporal lobe. She
also received a CXR and hip x-ray at that time that ruled out
additional fractures. She has dementia at baseline and is
oriented only to person, but was otherwise neurologically
intact. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended reversal of
anticoagulation, SQ Heparin, and q4 hr neuro checks. She
received Vitamin K, Profilnine, and 2u FFP. Her INR's were
followed throughout her stay, her coumadin and ASA were held and
she did not require additional coagulation intervention. Her SC
Heparin was eventually decreased from TID to [**Hospital1 **] dosing without
incident. As the ED felt that she required more frequent neuro
checks than the original recommendation, she was admitted to the
MICU overnight to receive q2 hour neuro checks. After a full day
of frequent checks, she was transferred to the medicine floor
for continued care.
-She will follow-up with Neurosurgery in 1 month for repeat head
imaging and will hold her Coumadin until then.
.
# Fall - Patient's fall was of unclear etiology. The patient is
a poor historian given her dementia, but per her recollection
she was cleaning the bathroom floor when she fell. She has no
memory following the fall. If this is accurate, her fall was
most likely mechanical as she has no history of seizure, was not
orthostatic, and demonstrated no evidence of infection as
assessed by vitals signs, CXR, UA, and WBC. EP evaluated her
pacemaker and found no evidence that she had a cardiac event to
explain her fall. She was monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospitalization and did not demonstrate concerning morphology or
clinical symptoms. 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were negative. She
had an ECHO in [**4-28**] that demonstrated an EF of 60% without AS
and a CXR showed no abnormalities. She was assessed by PT and
cleared for dispo to her [**Hospital3 **] facility, but given the
extent of her dementia, she is being to rehab before
transitioning to a long-term facility with 24 hour monitoring.
.
# Afib - Patient is atrial paced since [**2189**]. She had normal
vital signs throughout her hospitalization. She was continued on
her home dose of Sotalol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] and her anticoagulative
regimen of Coumadin and ASA were held throughout her stay with
plan to restart after follow-up with Neurosurgery. Her pacemaker
was evaluated as above.
-hold coumadin until neurosurgery follow up
.
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure - Patient demonstrated no signs
of fluid overload on exam, so home lasix was held. A Digoxin
level was obtained based on a Cr of 1.8, but it was not
elevated, so she was continued on her home dose of Digoxin. PO
intake was appropriate, but as she demonstrated no need for
Lasix by clinical exam, it was held throughout her stay. On
review of records, it appears that the patient has not seen a
cardiologist in approximately 3 years, so she should follow up
with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] lasix until patient follows up with PCP or until
clinically indicated.
.
# Dementia - Patient is pleasant and agreeable, although per
[**Location (un) **] her dementia has been worsening over the last
year. She was continued on her home dose of Namenda, Aricept,
Mirtazapine and Citalopram per home doses.
.
# Chronic kidney disease - Pt. with a creatinine of 1.8 on
admission, decreased to 1.7 by day 3 of her hospitalization. A
baseline Cr in [**2189**] was 1.2, but she has no record of a
physician appointment since [**2190**], so it is unclear the
progression of her [**Name (NI) 2091**]. Her Digoxin level was assessed and found
to be appropriate, so it was continued. Her Lasix dose was held
as it did not appear to be clinically indicated and out of
concern for worsen
