Chief Complaint:
suspected overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intramedullary nailing with cephalomedullary
device, gamma nail of right femur fracture.


History of Present Illness:
52 yo M with a history of paraplegia secondary ot HTLV-1
infection, sacral decubiti, COPD, and substance abuse who was
admitted [**12-13**] for menal status changes and respiratory
distress, intubated with pneumonia, sucessfully extubated, then
discharged to his NH on [**12-21**], who re-presents today with a
suspected methadone/benzo overdose responding to narcan in the
ED. He is on chronic methadone/oxycodone at his nursing home for
pain and was found unresponsive w/ a respiratory rate of 4 and
bp of 72/64, satting 88%, EMS was called and gave 4 mg narcan to
which he responded well, however he required two additional
doses for decreased respirations in the ED. Recieved 3 L of NS
for blood pressure support. Toxicology was consulted and
recommended against a narcan gtt. In the ED he desatted to
89-90% on 2L NC and was placed on NRB, subsequently desatted to
75-80% on NRB, lung exam ronchorous, gas at that time 7.37/48/54
and was intubated of hypoxic respiratory failure. CXR on
admission showed resolving pneumonia, shortly prior to
intubation, showing worsened bibasilar infiltrates, possibly c/w
aspiration.

intubation and PEG
2.	Sacral decubitus ulcers w/ chronic pain

Brief Hospital Course:
A: 52 yo gentleman with h/o paraplegia [**2-19**] HTLV-1, multiple
sacral decubiti, COPD, and polysubstance abuse recently admitted
with pneumonia who p/w mental status changes likely socondary to
oversedation with methadone and acute hypoxic respiratory
distress likely secondary to aspiration event.  During
hospitalization the following problems were addressed:

1. mental status changes: The patient responded well to narcan
and was found to have methadone and benzo's in his utox which
suggests a medication overdose.  The [**Hospital1 33092**] staff was
suspicious that the patient was buying drugs on the street and
reported that there were no prescribed benzo's in their
medication list.  Toxicology was consulted in the ED and
recommended not starting a narcan gtt as patient was on high
doses (30mg QID). He was intubated and sedated initially with
propofol, then versed and fentanyl. When sedation was lifted he
was treated with low dose methadone at 15mg [**Hospital1 **] and prn morphine
prior to dressing changes.  It is recommended that he follow-up
with a pain specialist to develop a more appropriate dosing
regimen.  As his mental status responded to narcan, and the
patient had had a thorough work-up just two weeks prior during
his prior hospitalization, it was not felt his presentation
warrented head CT or LP.  B12 and folate levels were normal
during prior hospitalization earlier this month.  Psychiatry
consulted to determine whether this overdose was intentional.
From their assessment, it was an accidental overdose, and may
have been secondary to a medication error.  The complete tox
screen revealed Trileptal and Clozaril in his system, which were
confirmed by his nursing home to be ordered for another patient
on the same floor.  Once his mental status improved to baseline,
methadone was titrated up to a dose that ensured adequate pain
control and put the patient at less risk for oversedation.

2. hypoxic respiratory failure: this was thought to be due to an
aspiration event that occurred in the ED. The patient became
acutely agitated when receiving narcan.  He was treated
initially with levofloxacin and clindamycin for a possible
aspiration pneumonia.  On day two, vancomycin was added to the
regimen to cover for possible MRSA pneumonia given his previous
hospitalization history.  He was extubated on day #3, but
required suppl
