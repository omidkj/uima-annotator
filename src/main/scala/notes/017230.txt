DIAGNOSIS:
Left second toe, MPJ:
- Acute osteomyelitis.
- Skin with ulceration.
- Bony and soft tissue margins are viable.
.
Foot
1. Cortical irregularity and periosteal reaction in the shaft of
the proximal
phalanx of the great toe, is concerning for osteomyelitis.
2. Suspected minimally impacted fracture at the base of the
middle phalanx
of the left second toe.
3. Continued healing of the proximal left metatarsal shaft
fracture with
callus formation and obscuration of the fracture line.

If clinically indicated, a lateral view targeted to the second
toe (the
current lateral view is of the entire foot) or alternatively a
CT or MRI may
help to better depcit the findings in the second digit.
