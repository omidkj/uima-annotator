History of Present Illness:
66 yo F with h/o PE, renal failure last Cr 5, seizure d/o was
found down apparently x9 days after an unwitnessed seizure. Pt
managed to crawl to window, yell for help, EMS arrived which
took pt to OSH. Pt has been recently hospitalized for malaise
[**Date range (1) 1163**]/[**2163**] and found to be in renal failure, which was
thought to be pre-renal in the setting of poor PO intake,
hypotension from adrenal insufficiency while off steriods. Her
Cr improved from 5.6 to 1.3 with IVF. She was also discharged on
cefuroxime for a UTI, abx to be completed [**6-24**]. Pt was
discharged to extended care facility on [**6-17**].
.
OSH: Arrived via EMS, speech slurred, found pt in filthy appt,
dried feces on legs, cat feces and urine feces everywhere.
Initial VS 96.1 BP 84/50 HR 103 86%RA FS 73. Initial BUN/Cr
110/10.1 K 4.4, Alb 2.7, WBC 19.7, HCT 33.2, PLT 444, 5%Bands,
INR 2.1. Tox screen +benzos and opiates. Serum ethanol-none
detected. Received Cefuroxime 750mg PO x1, solumedrol 125mg IV
x1, linezolid 600mg x1. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for furhter
management of ARF.
.
[**Hospital1 18**] ED Course: Initial VS 98.4 BP 96/44 HR 94 18 96%RA. SBP
dropped to 84/53 received 3.3 L NS IVF, SO2 dropped to 89% RA
increased to 96% 4L NC. She was noted to have rhabdo as well as
acute on chronic renal failure. Aggressive fluid resuscitation
was started and her renal function has improved since and her ck
has been trending down. Her UA was noted to be equivocal for UTI
and grew VRE which per ID was likely colonization. SHe was noted
to have gram positive cocci bacteremia and was started on
vancomycin for this. speciation is currently pending. pt's
subsequently transferred to the floor for further management. on
arrival she has no specific complaint other than refusing her
vancomycin although she agrees to take her anti-seizure
medicationse.
.
Per pt ROS: She denies any f/c/s. No cough. No chest pain /
palpitations. No abdominal pain/N/V/Diarrhea. c/o dysuria. She
is confused, c/o HA but no visual changes. Poor historian,
paranoid, very tangential speech--could not fully evaluate.

Discharge [**Month/Day/Year **]:

.
CT head [**7-5**]:
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
shift
of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular
territorial
infarct.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation appears preserved and there
is unchanged appearance to age appropriate atrophy.  Mild
calcifications noted within the carotid siphons bilaterally.
Soft tissues and osseous structures appear unremarkable.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:

No acute intracranial pathology.
..
..
CT C-spine [**7-5**]:
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture or
dislocation.  There is multilevel degenerative joint and
degenerative disc disease.  No prevertebral soft tissue swelling
is identified.  Visualized contents of the intrathecal sac
appear unremarkable.
Please note overall examination was slightly limited due to a
large amount of artifact from the shoulders.

IMPRESSION:
No acute fracture or dislocation.

..
..
[**7-5**] CXR(portable)
FINDINGS:  Other than linear atelectasis noted at the left base,
lungs appear clear.  There is mild indistinctness to the
perihilar vessels and engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature
which may suggest mild amount of fluid overload
in this patient with known renal failure.  No evidence of
pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are not
significantly changed. No large right effusion is identified,
however the left costophrenic angle is not included on current
film.

Surgical hardware from right total shoulder replacement is again
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Left lower lobe linear
atelectasis.

2.  Perihilar haziness and congestion of the pulmonary
vasculature likely
relates to fluid overload in this patient with known renal
failure.
..
..
[**7-5**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm 89. Borderline first degree A-V block. Compared to
tracing
of [**2163-6-14**] the premature atrial beats are absent.

..
[**7-8**] Echo:
Conclusions:
Limited images obtained. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall  motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic  function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo F with paranoid and seizure d/o, CKD, PE on
anticoagulation found down for 9 days and was noted to have
acute on chronic renal failure, apparent gram positive cocci
bacteremia. Patient admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-5**], transferred to the
floor on [**7-7**]. The following issues were addressed on this
admission:
.
1. Neuro/MS change: Patient was noted to be down at home.
Etiology thought to be secondary to seizure.  Patient maintained
on TID klonopin alone for seizure prophylaxis at home.  Patient
head CT negative, Utox positive for benzos and opiates.
Metabolic derangements as below. Had no evidence of trauma or
acute process by CT, cardiac enzymes cycled and remained flat.
EKG is unchanged from baseline.  Patient's mental status
improved throughout her stay and she is at her baseline on
discharge.  Neurology consulted on the patient and recommended
initiation of dilantin for seizure management.  Had no seizures
throughout stay.  Initially on klonopin 1
