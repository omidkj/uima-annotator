CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hyponitremia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 81 year old female with a
history of hypertension, remote cerebrovascular accident and
unclear history of malignancy involving the right axillary
node six years ago.  The patient had been in her usual state
of health until approximately one week prior to admission
when she felt a hacking nonproductive cough.  The patient was
treated at this time with an unknown antibiotic for
bronchitis without significant improvement.  The patient
returned to her primary care physician on the day prior to
admission and was started on a prednisone taper 80 mg for two
weeks.  The patient reported fatigue, generalized weakness
and decreased p.o. intake over the past several days.  On the
morning of presentation at admission she felt dizzy and fell
to the floor alone where she remained from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00
p.m.  the patient denies any loss of consciousness or head
trauma.  She also denies any preceding chest pain, shortness
of breath, nausea, vomiting or palpitations.  She recalls all
events.  She was found by her son alert but minimally
confused, complaining of right hip pain.  The patient was
taken to the [**Hospital3 4527**] Emergency Department where hip
and pelvis films were done and were negative for fracture.
Eventual vitals on presentation to [**Hospital3 4527**] were a
temperature of 97, heart rate of 62, blood pressure 237/74.

LABS:  Revealed a serum sodium of 109.

The patient received one liter of D5 half normal saline plus
two amps of sodium bicarbonate.  Her urine output was
reported to be approximately 1400 cc.  The second liter of
intravenous fluids was hung and the patient was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care
Unit for further care.  On arrival, the patient was
comfortable, complaining of right hip pain and cough.

Review of systems was negative for recent weight loss, fevers
or chills, nausea and vomiting.  She denied any change in
stool or abdominal girth.  The patient was accompanied by her
son who stated that the patient was not far from her baseline
mental status.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Cerebrovascular accident 10 years prior with a mild right
sided weakness.
4.  History of "metastatic cancer" in a lymph node six years
prior status post resection and XRT of the right axilla and
anterior chest.  The patient states this was not breast
cancer.  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2026**] at [**Hospital1 2025**].
5.  Right arm edema secondary to above.
6.  Normal mammogram/patient report one year ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Antibiotics of unknown, currently completed course.
2.  Prednisone 80 mg q. day.
3.  Solu-Medrol 125 times one in Emergency Department on
[**3-12**].
4.  Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She is widowed and
active at baseline.  Her son is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 33601**], phone
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 33602**] and work number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33603**].  The patient
denies any tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs; temperature 99.2, heart
rate 65, blood pressure 120/37, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 99% on room air.  General; the patient is an
elderly female who is well nourished, alert and
conversational.  HEENT; no evidence of head trauma.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light accommodation.
Oropharynx is dry.  Neck is supple with full range of motion,
there is no lymphadenopathy.  Jugular venous distention to 7
cm bilaterally.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2 with 3/6 systolic
murmur heard loudest at the left lower sternal border
consistent with tricuspid regurgitation.  There are no
gallops or rubs.  Lungs; there are faint crackles at the
right base, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
There are no wheezes.  Abdomen; healed lower midline scar, no
tenderness, guarding or distention.  There are normoactive
bowel sounds in all four quadrants, no palpable
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are without calf tenderness,
bilateral hips and knees with full range of motion.  There is
no pain, mild pain to palpation of the right buttock and hip.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  Neurological; the
patient is alert and oriented to hospital.  The patient is
able to recite the day and date of [**2154**].  Cranial nerves
II-XII are grossly intact, sensation is intact, motor is [**2-27**]
in the right upper extremity, 4+/5 in the left lower
extremity, 4+/5 bilateral lower extremities, right toe is
upgoing, left toe is downgoing.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 109, potassium 4.1, chloride 74,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 7, creatinine 0.9, blood glucose is 171,
AST is 70, ALT 55, alkaline phosphatase 116, total bilirubin
0.6, CK is 2269 with MB fraction of 36 and index of 1.6,
troponin of less than 0.2.  Serum osmolalities are 2.7 but
believed to be falsely high secondary to glucose greater than
100.  Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a
rate of 53, normal axis, no ST-T wave changes.

Chest x-ray was poor film, rotated with no infiltrates or
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient appeared uvolemic and initially
was administered 2 liters of intravenous fluid with excellent
urine output.  The patient was repleted her sodium to a goal
of 120 with 3% normal saline at 250 cc/4 hours and rechecked
serial sodiums.  The patient also had a normal TSH which was
ordered to rule out hyperthyroidism.  Urine lytes were sent
as well as repeat serum osmolytes.  Urine lytes were
indicated of an appropriately diluted urine.  Hence, given
this finding it was believed that SIADH was less likely in
the differential.  The following day, after the patient's
sodium had stabilized above 120, she was transferred to the
medical floor.  At this time, the patient was discontinued
off of intravenous fluids and allowed to equilibrate on her
own.  By serial sodium check on the first day on the medical
floor, the patient's mid day sodium was 128 and her mental
status changes were noted to be completely resolved.  The
patient continued to equilibrate on her own and repeat urine
lytes were checked which showed that despite concentrated
iron, given the patient's mixed picture the etiology of her
hyponitremia was not able to be elucidated.  She was
discharged to rehabilitation facility in stable condition on
[**2155-3-14**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post fall.
2.  Severe hypernitremia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to have her sodium
checked on [**2155-3-18**] and serial sodium thereafter.
