LABORATORY DATA:  Labs revealed the following:  White count
4.9, hematocrit 38.2, platelet count 183, INR 1.1, PTT 26.3,
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 102, CO2 27, BUN 20,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 132.  Head CT shows left hemorrhage
in the region of the MCA accumulating in the left lateral

The patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9224**] service to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.

The patient had a vent drain placed on the day of admission.
She went directly to angiography, which showed a ruptured
left PICA aneurysm.  She underwent coiling of the left PICA
aneurysm without any interprocedure complication.  This was
monitored in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively.

Postoperatively, neurologically, she was arousable and not
following commands.  Pupils:  Left was larger than the right.
They were both sluggish to react.

slight.  She was restless.  She was moving all extremities
with some right sided weakness and attempting to follow
commands by opening her eyes to voice.

distress, which was nonresponsive to BiPAP.  The patient was
intubated at that time.

Neurologically, the patient's pupils reminded reactive to
light, but she was only localizing briskly on the right,
greater than the left, with decreased movement on the right.

On [**2163-9-14**], the patient had bronchoscopy, which
showed some thick secretions, but no obvious mucous plugging.
The patient had repeat head CT on [**2163-7-20**] that showed
resolving left lateral hematoma.

On [**2163-7-20**], the patient had PEG and tracheostomy done
without complication.

On [**2163-7-21**], the patient's vent drain was
discontinued due to decreased output.  The patient's mental
