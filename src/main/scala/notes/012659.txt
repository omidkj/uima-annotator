Cardiac catheterization:
C.O 3.94  C.I. 2.30  RA 14  RV 42/15  PA 42/24  PCWP 21
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling
pressures
and slightly low cardiac index
3. Patent bypass grafts.
4. Overall clinical presentation consistent with flash pulmonary
edema
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patient revealed severe native CAD with proximally occluded RCA
and
LMCA.
2. Selective angiography of grafts revealed a widely patent
SVG-OM that
filled a large OM. The SVG to PDA was widely patent. The LIMA to
LAD
was widely patent.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of right and left
sided
filling pressures with RA of 14mmHG and PCWP of 21mmHG. The
cardiac
index was low at 2.3. There was mild pulmonary hypertension.
There was
no gradient across the aortic valve.
4. Ventriculography was limited as the pigtail migrated back to
ascending aorta one second after injection began. However there
appeared to be anterolateral and inferior hypokinesis with EF of
about
35%.
.
[**2159-2-7**] Echocardiogram:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). While the study is technically difficult
and the views limited, it appears that there is mild inferior
wall hypokinesis. The inferolateral wall is not seen well enough
to comment on its function.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2158-2-6**]:CHEST, AP PORTABLE:
The tip of the endotracheal tube lies in the right main stem
bronchus and should be withdrawn for more optimal positioning.
There is a nasogastric tube coursing into the stomach, whose
inferior position is not fully evaluated here. The heart size is
normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There is
diffuse bilateral air space disease with a somewhat patchy
distribution, which could be seen in a variety of conditions,
including congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and ARDS. Of
note, there are no pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, or hilar
opacities to suggest cardiac failure, however.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse airspace disease. Right mainstem bronchus
intubation.
.
[**2159-2-7**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST. Compared to the prior radiograph
obtained yesterday,there is marked improvement in the
interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema. There are no pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. ET tube and NG tube
are in good position.
IMPRESSION: Marked improvement in the pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old female with CAD s/p CABG [**5-16**] ((SVG-PDA, SVG-OM,
LIMA-LAD), HTN, AFib, DM presents with acute dyspnea, intubated,
now s/p cardiac cath, likely acute pulmonary edema from
diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure given CABG vein
grafts widely patent.  No interventions on cardiac
catheterization and patient tolerated procedure without
complications, PCWP was 21.  Patient was diuresed with lasix and
extubated hours after the catheterization.
.
1.  CV: Ischemia, taken to cath, with vein grafts widely patent,
no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.  Continue ASA, statin,
beta blocker.
        Pump: Echo performed, EF 50-55%, Diastolic and systolic
dysfunction seen on Left ventriculogram on cath (Echo results
above).  Likely pulmonary edema in setting of dietary
indiscretion.  Diuresed with lasix, pulmonary edema much
improved by exam and cvhest x-ray.  Restarted ACEI for afterload
reduction.  Changed to po lasix dose.  This may need to be
increased as outpatient.  Patient instructed to check daily
weights and call physician if weight increases > 2 lbs.
        Rhythm: normal sinus rhythm, monitored on Telemetry
.
2.  DM: insulin gtt on day of admission given blood sugars
300's, monitored finger sticks.  No ketones in urine, so
unlikely DKA.  Transitioned to RISS the next day.  Restarted
oral hypoglycemics prior to discharge and sugars well-controlled
and not requiring insulin.
.
3.  Resp: s/p extubation on [**2-5**], breathing comfortably off
oxygen.
.
4.  FEN: low sodium, diabetic diet.  Patient had nutrition
consult for low salt diet education.
.
5.  Dispo: Patient to be discharged to home without services
after being cleared by physical therapy.  She has an appointment
scheduled with her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32963**] on [**2159-2-21**].
