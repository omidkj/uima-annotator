Chief Complaint:
portal vein injury s/p Nissen fundoplication

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72M s/p lap converted to open Nissen fundopilcation on [**9-24**] for refractory GERD, complicated by portal vein
repair and thrombus. On POD 1 he was found to be in multifocal
atrial tachycardia; cardiology was consulted. He was initially
asymptomatic, however then developed diaphoresis and fever to
101.1, he was transferred to the ICU and started on a cardizem
drip. His blood pressures decreased and he had a transient
pressor requirement. A CTA was obtained and was negative for PE.
On POD 2 he was off pressors. ID was consulted and he was
started on Invanz. A CT abd/pelvis was obtained which
demonstrated subtotal occlusion of the left portal vein with
possible left lobe ischemia. He was started on a heparin drip
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On day of transfer his WBC was 12.7, Cr was 0.56, and Tbili was
2.3 Dbili was 1.2, AST 497 ALT 1062 and AP 146. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], he continued to be tachycardic 110's-160's and irregular,
although he denies any chest pain or subjective shortness of
breath. He endorses peri-incisional and postoperative abdominal
pain. He is transferred on a heparin drip but off all pressors.
He has a right femoral line and left a-line in place.

IMAGING:
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2126-9-26**]
- S/p Nissen fundoplication with indeterminate findings at GE
junction, recommend esophagram
- Subtotal occlusion L portal vein with clot in left lobe,
possible left lobe ischemia. Hepatic artery patent
- Gallstones, possible chronic cholecystitis
- Bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Hepatobiliary/Transplant Surgery
service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2126-9-26**] for management
of his left portal vein thrombus following a portal vein
ligation during Nissen fundoplication on [**2126-9-24**]. Upon arrival, he was admitted to the Surgical ICU for
continued cardiovascular monitoring given his multifocal atrial
tachycardia while on a heparin drip. MAT was managed with
titration of metoprolol.

Left portal vein thrombus evaluated with hepatic Duplex
ultrasonography, showing likely nearly occlusive clot of the
left portal vein with very low flow.  Multiple gallstones
without other signs to suggest cholecystitis was noted. Repeat
ultrasound imaging on [**2126-9-29**] confirmed these findings.

Patient was started on warfarin PO 5 mg on HD#2 ([**9-28**]). Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was transferred from the SICU to the surgical floor on
hospital day 2 once it was determined he was cardiovascularly
stable. The heparin drip was continued as warfarin
anti-coagulation was initiated (5 mg warfarin dosed again on
HD#3, [**9-29**]). PTT was 71.7 and INR 3.3. Heparin drip was
discontinued [**9-30**] and Coumadin was held for [**9-30**] given rapid
increase in INR after 2 doses of coumadin. Repeat INR should be
checked on [**10-1**].

Now stable, the plan was to transfer back to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**]
Hospital under the care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for continued management on
HD#4. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred following his request to be at
[**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**], as it allowed him to be closer to his family.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] will likely need a TTE upon transfer to further
evaluate his cardiac function, given his MAT (controlled with
metoprolol) during his stay at [**Hospital1 18**]. This was not completed
while at [**Hospital1 18**] due to the acuity of his illness and stability
from a cardiovascular standpoint.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2126-9-27**] for
complications related to your recent Nissen fundoplication. You
were admitted under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Hepatobiliary
Surgery service. You had a brief stay in the Surgical ICU,
during which time you were giving an intravenous infusion of
heparin, a medication used to prevent clot formation to treat a
clot in your left portal vein (a vein into your liver). You were
also started on warfarin, a drug used for long-term management
of your clot.

You will be transferring back to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital for
care.
Please speak with your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 6783**], if you develop
fever, nausea/vomiting, rash/redness/swelling around your
surgical site, new bleeding, loss of conciousness, or other
concerning symptoms.
Please take the prescribed analgesic medications as needed. You
may not drive or heavy machinery while taking narcotic analgesic
medications.  You may also take acetaminophen (Tylenol) as
directed, but do not exceed 3000 mg in one day. Please get
plenty of rest, continue to walk several times per day, and
drink adequate amounts of fluids. Avoid strenuous physical
activity and refrain from heavy lifting greater than 10 lbs.,
until you follow-up with your surgeon, who will instruct you
further regarding activity restrictions. Please also follow-up
with your primary care physician.

Avoid swimming or baths until cleared by your surgeon. Clean
your wound with soap and warm water. Pat the area dry gently.
Your staples will be removed by the surgeon at a future
appointment.

Warfarin (Coumadin):
- What is this medicine used for? This medicine is used to thin
the blood so that clots will not form.
- How does it work? Warfarin changes the body's clotting system.
 It thins the blood to prevent clots from forming.
- What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Signs of
a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing; chest
tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; fits; or
swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe dizziness or
passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you hit your
head. Talk with health
