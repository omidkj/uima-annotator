Lungs ronchi bilateraly
heart RRR

Pertinent Results:
Echo:[**2185-7-11**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with small cavity size and hyperdynamic
systolic
function (LVEF>75%). Valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] is not clearly seen, but there
is premature
closure of the aortic valve c/w obstructive cardiomyopathy. The
right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate free wall hypokinesis and
akinesis/dyskinesis of the
distal third of the free wall. The aortic leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Aortic stenosis is not suggested. No definite aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen (but
images are suboptimal and cannot be fully excluded)l. Moderate
to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to CR [**Doctor First Name **] for further treatment. Found to
have an outflow obstruction in the heart. After 1 week of
attempts of extubation he underwent a tracheostomy and a
percutaneous gastrostomy tube.
Multiple times when diuresis was attempted he changed his rhythm
to a fib, a flutter requiring anticoagulation.
he also during the hospitalization developed a ventilator
associated pneumonia, with positive blood cultures. This
cultures were proven to me MRSA> He did not responded well to
Vancomycin so we switch the antibiotics to Linezolid with
adequate response.
He is now doing better, appropriately treated for his pneumonia
and receiving anticoagulation
He will be DC to rehab soon
