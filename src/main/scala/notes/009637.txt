[**2167-10-2**] Chest X-ray:
IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings in the lungs
bilaterally,
asymmetrically more so on the right than on the left.  These
findings could be related to either pulmonary edema versus
atypical infection.  Clinical correlation suggested.

[**2167-10-2**] Abdomen/pelvis X-ray:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of obstruction or perforation.

[**2167-10-5**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Ascending thoracic aorta
is top normal in size without evidence of dissection.
2. On a background of COPD and pulmonary edema, there are
bilateral multifocal opacifications which may represent
infectious process and/or aspiration.
3. Significant esophageal dilatation, with retained fluid and
food contents.  If this has not already been further assessed,
recommend evaluation.
4.  Mediastinal, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric root
lymphadenopathy with 1.7 cm necrotic subcarinal lymph node.
Differential diagnosis for this is extensive, but does include
malignancy.  Recommend further evaluation or correlation with
clinical history.
5. Nodularity of the bilateral adrenal glands.  Attention on
followup.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
This is 78yoM h/o CAD and COPD now w/ 3 days of worsening
dyspnea in the setting of [**12-22**] months of daily post-prandial
vomiting in the setting of esophageal dysmotility. Patient was
found to have hypoxic on admission and was treated empirically
for COPD exacerbation with steroids and nebulizer treatments. On
HOD#3, patient developed acute desaturation requiring increased
oxygen. CTA was completed and ruled out PE however showed
bilateral diffuse airspace disease concerning for aspiration as
well as food compaction in the esophagus. Patient was
transferred to the ICU for further interventions and close
monitoring. While in MICU, discussion occurred regarding
patient's preferences and goals. Patient in the past has had G/J
tube for feeding because of esophageal dysmotility and it was
his desire to not pursue that option again. Additionally, it
order to reverse the underlying issue, he would have needed an
EGD which would have required intubation and patient was against
intubation. Given these goals, his care was reoriented around
comfort, which allowed him to eat. He understands that by
eating, he is at equisitely high risk for aspiration, which
could ultimately lead to death. He was started on pain
medications and ativan for anxiety. Given his stable picture, he
was transferred to a skilled nursing facility for hospice care.
