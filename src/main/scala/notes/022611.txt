History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77315**] is a 74yo male with PMH significant for CAD s/p
CABG, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, CRI, and CHF who
is being transferred from the CCU for management of respiratory
failure. He was initially admitted on [**4-1**] to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service
with increasing dyspnea on exertion at home. He had been
complaining of exertional dyspnea and increased weight despite
increasing doses of Lasix. Of note, he was diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation in [**Month (only) 404**].
During his time on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service he was given boluses of
Lasix IV
with little improvement. He was then transitioned to a nitro and
Lasix gtt. He also underwent a thoracocentesis and 1.5L of fluid
was removed. The patient continued to become more dyspneic,
tachypneic, and hypoxic despite thoracocentesis and diuresis.
Further diuresis was limited by lower blood pressures. He was
then transferred to the CCU for further management.
In the CCU the patient became more short of breath and hypoxic.
He was intubated and then diuresed. His acute respiratory
failure was
thought to be related to his heart failure.  After significant
diuresis and improvement in his oxygen requirements, he  was
weaned from the ventilator.  On the day of extubation, the
patient remained sedated. Due to hypercarbic respiratory
failure, the patient was re-intubated the same day. His altered
mental status was further worked up since it was thought that it
contributed to difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Despite
this, he was not able to be extubated. He also completed a 10
day course of vanc/zosyn during this time for VAP. Given
difficulty with weaning off the ventilator, the pt underwent
tracheostomy. Given difficulty with diuresis with diuretics, the
patient was started on CVVH. In addition, he was started on
Meropenem for sputum culture grew Enterobacter. He also
underwent a bronchoscopy today which revealed blood and
increased secretions. He is now being transferred to the MICU
for management of his respiratory failure.

Relevant Imaging:
1)CT chest ([**4-25**]): Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right
more than left. Large parts of the lung parenchyma are involved
in an ongoing fibrotic process that may be triggered by other
infection or overhydration. No mass lesions, no relevant
lymphadenopathy.

2)CT head ([**4-25**]): In comparison with the prior study, no
significant change is noted, persistent mild prominence of the
sulci and ventricles, likely age related and involutional in
nature. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
infarct.

3)ECHO ([**4-15**]): Small pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Grossly preserved
biventricular systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
74yo male with complicated medical history who initially
presented for CHF exacerbation and then transferred to the CCU,
then MICU for respiratory failure.

1) Resp failure - The patient was admitted to the CCU and
rapidly became more short of breath and hypoxic.  He was
intubated and initially required high settings to maintain
oxygenation.  He was diuresed and his respiratory failure was
thought to be related to his heart failure.  After significant
diuresis and improvement in his oxygen requirement, the patient
was weaned from the ventilator.  On the day of extubation, the
patient was still somewhat sedated, but it was thought he was
awake enough to maintain ventilation.  Due to hypercarbic
respiratory failure, the patient was re-intubated the same day.
It was thought his mental status was not alert enough at the
time for successful extubation.  His sedating medicines were
held and he was worked up for other causes of altered mental
status including uremia or hepatic encephalopathy.  Neither of
these were felt to be contributing to his difficulty with
extubation.  Metabolic abnormalities including increased bicarb
and low sodium were also corrected.  However, the ventilator was
not able to be weaned successfully.  Once on pressure support,
the patient respiratory rate increased and he was agitated.
Pulmonary was consulted but also could not fully explain why he
could not come off the ventilator.  He also completed a 10 day
course of vanc/zosyn for VAP.   A working hypothesis is that his
failure is related to his profound diastolic heart failure and
some underlying restrictive pulmonary defect that is not well
understood.  A tracheostomy was placed. Bronchoscopy was also
done which revealed increased secretions and presence of blood.
The patient was then transferred to the MICU for management of
his respiratory failure. His respiratory status continued to
decline and he became increasingly difficult to oxygenate and
his pH on ABG became more acidotic. After a family meeting the
decision was made to change code status to comfort status only.
Patient expired quickly after the tracheostomy was disconnected
from the ventilator.

2)Hypotension - Patient was hypotensive upon admission to the
CCU.  He was noted to be febrile and broad spectrum antibiotics
were started with vancomycin and zosyn.  He was treated with a
10 day course for hospital associated pnuemonia.  A swan was
placed for better management of his hypotension and shock.   It
is likely that he had a mixed picture of some septic and
cardiogentic shock.  Initially he was quickly weaned from the
levophed and he maintained his pressures.  Later in his ICU
course, he was sent to the cath lab for replacement of a swan
and a new IJ line.  During this procedure he again became
hypotensive and it was thought that some quantity of bacteria
was liberated during removal of his old line.  He was restarted
on levophed and again started on vancomycin.  Cultures remained
negative.  It seems likely that the cause of this new
hypotension was propofol.  The propofol gtt was stopped and he
was taken off pressors. During his stay in the MICU the patient
became hypotensive and required 2 pressors to maintain his blood
pressure. The pressors were sto
