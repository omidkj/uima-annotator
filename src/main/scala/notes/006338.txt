RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2195-10-7**] 7:14 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Assess for lung re-expansion, new processes

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman with LUL mass, post obstructive pneumonia s/p
bronch, resection of mass
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess for lung re-expansion, new processes
HISTORY: Left upper lobe mass post bronchoscopy for obstructive
pneumonia.

AP BEDSIDE CHEST. The left lower thorax is partially opacified
suggesting both atelectasis and effusion. Equivocal small right
effusion. Right lung normally aerated as is the visualized left
upper lobe with no mass identified. There is minimal if any left
mediastinal shift. Multiple tubes and catheters are
satisfactorily positioned and no PTX on this semi-erect film.
Allowing for technical differences there is no change from
similar exam one day ago.

IMPRESSION: No short interval change in left lower lobe
atelectasis/effusion.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2195-10-2**] 7:17 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p bronchoscopy

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p bronchoscopy
INDICATION: 81-year-old female status post bronchoscopy.

COMPARISON: None.

AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: A nasogastric tube descends
below the diaphragm with the proximal side port at the level of
the gastroesophageal junction. An endotracheal tube terminates 4
cm above the carina. There is complete opacification of the left
hemithorax with slight tracheal deviation to the left. No
pneumothorax is seen. The right lung is clear. The surrounding
soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Left lung collapse with tracheal deviation.

Nasogastric tube proximal side port at the gastroesophageal
junction. Advancement by approximately 3 cm is recommended.

These findings were called to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 8:30 p.m. on
[**2195-10-2**].

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2195-10-3**] 12:25 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C

Reason: Evaluate obstructing LUL lesion.
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate obstructing LUL lesion.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT torso.

INDICATION: This is an 81-year-old female with a reported
history of left upper lobe obstructing lesion. Evaluation
requested.

COMPARISONS: There are no prior studies available for
comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast MDCT axial images were acquired of the
lower chest and abdomen. Approximately 130 cc of IV Optiray
contrast was injected and axial images from the thoracic inlet
to the pubic symphysis were acquired. 3-minute delay images of
the kidneys were also obtained. Coronal and sagittal images were
also obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube is
present within the lumen of the trachea. A nasogastric tube is
present within the lumen of the esophagus. There has been
collapse of the left upper and left lower lobes causing shift of
the mediastinum to the left. There are diffuse coronary
calcifications but otherwise the heart and great vessels are
unremarkable. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right. There has been collapse/consolidation of
both the upper and lower lobe on the left. There is associated
volume loss. There are areas of consolidation that appear to be
loculated particularly in the anterior aspect on the left. In
the aerated portions of the left lung, there are several tree
and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearing areas that could represent an underlying
infectious process. There are no definitive endobronchial
lesions visualized (CT is a limited modality to fully evaluate
for endobronchial lesions). There is no mediastinal, hilar or
axillary lymphadenopathy that meets criteria for pathology.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a small
amount of air present within the biliary system of the liver.
This would be consistent with a previous history of
sphincterotomy. In segment II/III of the liver, there are two
areas of hypoattenuation that measure 2.2 and 4.3 cm diameter
respectively. These areas could represent areas of altered
perfusion or they could represent intrahepatic masses. Further
examination of these areas is recommended via ultrasound. These
areas do not enhance post- contrast and they do not appear to
disrupt the normal hepatic vasculature. There are no other focal
liver abnormality is identified. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. The pancreas, spleen, stomach, and adrenal
glands ap
