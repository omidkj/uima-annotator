Called by Emergency Department to evaluate
episodes of speech difficulty and "freezing up"

    lobectomy/resection).
2. Intraoperative image guidance.
3. Microscopic dissection.
4. Duraplasty.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 64 year-old right-handed male with history of
oligodendroma, found in 07 , s/p resection, stable at least
since
[**12-9**], first presented in SE (long ICU stay c/b PEs and VAPs),
seizure disorder, HTN, hypothyroidism, DM2 and hyperlipidemia
who
presents with multiple brief episodes of "freezing up" and
difficulty producing speech for ~3-5 days, with increasing
frequency over the last 2 days.

The patient is not sure exactly when these episodes started but
believes he did not have any last week.  He first noted brief
episodes of difficulty producing speech.  He felt that all of a
sudden he wasn't able to get out the words he wanted to.  He was
able to think about them in his head, but felt "stuck".  He was
occasionally able to get some words out, but not all.  He
thought
these lasted anywhere from 5-30 seconds.  These episodes were
only a couple of times a day on Wednesday, but continued to
increase in frequency and by the weekend he was having many (he
couldn't quantify but said more than 20 a day).  At this point
he
also noticed that his body would "freeze up" and "get tight"
with
these episodes.  He said he would clench his arms and legs and
find them difficulty to move, "like I was paralyzed"   He said
if
he thought about it he may be able to get some movement during
these episodes, but again it was very difficult.  He also
endorsed a feeling of fear during these episodes.  He did not
have any LOC with them.  He did not experience any [**Year (2 digits) **]
laceration or bladder/bowel incontinence.  He returned to his
baseline immediately after these events and did not believe he
had any confusion or lethargy.  His language also returned to
baseline.

Multiple of these episodes were witnessed.  The patient will
stop
taking and tense his SCMs.  Head turning was not a consistent
direction.  He also will tense the muscles off his upper arms,
bilaterally.  He does not talk initially and stares straight
ahead.  However he then will respond to some questions, and
answer, "yes it is happening", and was able to count to ten both
directions during one of these episodes.  His muscles are tensed
but they are reposition-able and will intermittently follow
commands, but stated "it takes a lot of concentration"  There is
no eye deviation.  He does breath rapidly during these episodes,
but no vital changes were noted on telemetry.  The episodes last
5-15 seconds, and he returns to baseline afterwards.

The patient is a somewhat tangential historian and related
multiple ideas for why he thought this was happening.  He was
most concerned about any progression of his oligodendroma.
However he also noted that he has been attempting to taper off
his standing Ativan, which various amounts of success.  He was
on
at one point 4-6mg total daily dose, and had been tapering down
to 2mg total daily dose.  He has had various problems with this
taper, particularly he be lives his appetite is worse the less
Ativan he takes.  He had been intermittently taking 15mg of
phenobarbital to help wean him off the Ativan.  There are
various
notes that indicate the patient had a stay in detox at [**Hospital1 882**]
for benzo use issues.  In addition he has stopped a number of
his
medications because he feels they are interfering with his
ability to get of the Ativan, notably: metformin and Lipitor.

He has had epilepsy admissions in the past, and is currently a
patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  In OMR he was noted to have episodes
that sound similar in description to the spells he describes
here, although he states these are different than any he has
experienced before.

His prior seizure types were focal motor and per patient
primarily involved left arm and leg shaking.  He did have an
admission last year for seizures with a more atypical semiology
which involved a feeling of difficulty moving, associated with
garbled speech, a feeling of doom, and abdominal sensations.
There was no loss of consciousness during these episodes, which
never lasted more than 30 seconds.  These occurred in the
setting
of a self-taper of Topamax, which he blamed for the episodes.
The EEG monitoring during admission showed correlation of these
episodes with "electrographic seizures... of right frontal
origin."  Events stopped after Dilantin was loaded and
maintained.

He has been on Lamictal, Topamax in the past which were stopped.

He is currently on Dilantin alone.

On neuro ROS, the pt [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4273**] focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4273**] difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, patient does report some recent
worsening of cold and heat intolerance.  He has some weight loss
over the past months but was nota able to quantify.   No night
sweats. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4273**] cough, shortness of breath.  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4273**] chest pain or
tightness, palpitations.  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4273**] nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or
abdominal pain.  He has constipation at baseline.  No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4273**]
arthralgias or myalgias. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4273**] rash.
