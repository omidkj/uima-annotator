HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old
male with no known medical history, who presented to an
outside hospital's Emergency Room in [**Month (only) **] with complaints
of right foot swelling, pain and redness.  At that time, he
was treated with Cephalexin 500 mg by mouth four times a day
for ten days and, despite this antibiotic course, had
persistent redness and foot pain.  He was ultimately seen by
a health care associate, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], on [**2140-10-19**], and was given
a second trial of Cephalexin for 14 days, without resolution.
Due to the lack of resolution, dependent rubor and signs and
symptoms consistent with possible rest pain, he was
ultimately referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] for possible vascular
disease consultation.  Ultimately the patient received
impedance platysmography as well as an arteriogram that
showed significant disease that warranted an operation.  He
was brought to the operating room on [**2140-11-17**], where he
underwent a cross-femoral-to-femoral left-to-right bypass
including bilateral common femoral artery and endarterectomy
and bilateral profundoplasty and then a right
cross-femoral-to-posterior tibialis bypass graft utilizing a
non-reversed greater saphenous vein with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**].  At
the end of the operation, the patient had Dopplerable right
pulse which was the posterior tibial being monophasic.  The
patient was cared for in the postoperative Surgical Intensive
Care Unit due to the complexity of the case and the long
length of the patient's intubation, he was maintained on
ventilatory support for several days.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Ethanol, which he takes eight to ten
beers per day, tobacco greater than 50 pack years of smoking,
peripheral vascular disease, onychomycosis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Appendectomy, two different aborted
intra-abdominal procedures for presumed cancer, as well as
herniorrhaphy.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Keflex, Lotrimin.

LABORATORY DATA:   Hematocrit 40, BUN and creatinine 5 and
.7.  Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm with
occasional premature atrial contractions.  Heart rate was 88,
otherwise normal, no evidence of Q wave or ST segment change
or T wave inversion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient's postoperative course and
overall hospital course were remarkable for failure to
extubate.  He had respiratory failure on postoperative day
one, requiring emergent intubation.  He was maintained on
full ventilatory support postoperatively.  On postoperative
day one, his hematocrit was 31.  He had a BUN and creatinine
of 5 and .5.  He was noted to be hypotensive and very
tachycardic.  No electrocardiogram changes were seen, other
than sinus tachycardia to the 120s to 140s.  His low blood
pressures were treated with volume and ultimately he was
given Lopressor for his tachycardia.  He was initially also
given delirium tremens prophylaxis with an Ativan drip.
Electrocardiogram just showed sinus tachycardia at 108,
normal axis, with normal intervals.

By postoperative day number two, he had persistent
tachycardia.  He was actually started on diuresis, and given
increased titration of Lopressor.

On postoperative day number three, he had enzymes that were
sent to rule out a possible myocardial infarction, that
showed a CPK of 454 and 395, as well as an MB fraction of 6.9
and 6.6, and a troponin-I greater than 50 x 2.  Given this,
it looked like he had a possible non-Q wave postoperative
myocardial infarction.  Chest x-ray at that time additionally
showed evidence of congestive failure.  He was ultimately
referred to the Cardiology service, who recommended a bedside
transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed severe global
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 25%, and mildly
decreased systolic function.  It was a relatively poor study,
so no regional wall motion abnormalities could be assessed.
He was begun on a heparin drip and also given aspirin and
beta blockade as needed.  Lower extremity noninvasives were
also performed at that time, that showed no evidence of
thrombosis.

On [**2140-11-22**], his enzymes peaked.  His troponin-Is were again
greater than 50.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at
33, with normal axis, normal intervals, and he had 1 to 2 mm
ST segment depressions across the precordial leads V2 through
V5.  Given this, as well as the setting of a temperature
spike, he was pancultured, including blood cultures, line
cultures, etc.  His Swan-Ganz catheter was changed.  He had
resiting of all of his line sticks.

On postoperative day number six from the femoral-femoral
bypass, etc., he was noted to have a hematocrit of 29, a
white count of 10, BUN and creatinine of 15 and .6.  His
pulmonary artery pressures were 46/21, with a wedge of 15.
Cardiac output was 4.5, and an index of 2.5, systemic
vascular resistance of 1400.  Sputum cultures from [**2140-11-21**]
ultimately revealed Moraxella and E. coli that were sensitive
to Levaquin, and he was therefore treated for a presumptive
pneumonia.  His white count was 12,000 at this time.

On [**2140-11-25**], the Cardiology consult service performed a
cardiac catheterization showing elevated left ventricular end
diastolic pressures, trace mitral regurgitation, an ejection
fraction of 30%.  A ventriculogram study showed
anterolateral, apical, and apical inferior wall motion
abnormalities, consistent with a left dominant or left main
disease.  The left main coronary artery was eccentric and
severely calcified, with an 80% lesion as well as the left
anterior descending having a 90% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex was 80% stenosed.  Given this severe three vessel
disease and left main of approximately 80 to 90% stenosis,
the Cardiothoracic Surgical service was consulted on
[**2140-11-25**].  Cardiac Surgery therefore suggested that the
patient undergo a coronary artery bypass graft, given the
severe three vessel disease and left main disease.

He was transferred to the Cardiac Critical Care Unit and was
ultimately taken to the operating room on [**2140-11-27**], where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2, including
saphenous vein graft to the oblique marginal, and saphenous
vein graft to the left anterior descending.  The patient came
off pump with a mean arterial pressure of 70, CVP of 21, and
pulmonary artery pressure of 36.  He was in sinus tachycardia
at 100, and he was on milrinone drip.

Postoperatively from the coronary artery bypass graft, he was
taken to the Cardiac Surgical Recovery Unit, where his
postoperative hematocrit was 29.  He had a potassium of 4.4,
BUN and creatinine of 6 and .4.  He was still intubated,
sedated on propofol, being maintained on Neo-Synephrine .5
mcg/kg/minute.  He was additionally transfused two units of
packed red cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma.  He
was A-paced at 90.  He had an arterial blood gas with a gas
on 100% of 7.41, 39, 106, 24, -1.  Chest tube had put out 435
for one, and 280 for a second.  As a consequence, his
propofol was weaned.  He was extubated, and his milrinone was
maintained.  Aspirin was placed.  Lopressor was held for some
hypotension issues.  Neo-Synephrine was removed once a
transfusion was complete.

On postoperative day number two, he remained in the CSRU.
The milrinone that had been started post-transfusion and
post-Neo-Synephrine removal was ultimately weaned off by
postoperative day number two.  His hematocrit was noted to be
27, white count went down to 9000.  He continued his
Levaquin.  BUN and creatinine were 11 and .4.  Neurological
status was intact.  Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day
was started.  He was given lasix for diuresis.  His Swan-Ganz
catheter was removed.  Ultimately he was given a cardiac
diet, and it was recommended that he continue his Levaquin
for a total of ten day treatment for presumed Moraxella and
E. Coli pneumonia that was picked up post-vascular bypass
