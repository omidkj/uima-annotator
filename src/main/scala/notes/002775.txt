History of Present Illness:
55 y.o. male with PMHx of DM, HTN, CAD s/p IMI with 3 stents to
RCA and recently diagnosed RCC who is transferred from [**Hospital **]for ongoing work-up of acute renal failure and change in
mental status.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**2165-4-16**] for
chest and abdominal pain. He ruled out for an MI with cardiac
biomarkers and was felt to be constipated as was illustrated on
CT and thought to be due to chronic narcotic use for lower back
pain and right hip pain (awaiting hip replacement). His
constipation was treated aggressively with medications and
disimpaction with minimal effect. On day 4 of his
hospitalization, he was febrile to 104 with a leukocytosis to 14
and was pan-cultured while Vancomycin and Zosyn were started
empirically with specific concern for a PIV infection suggested
by surrounding erythema and edema. Blood cultures later grew
GPCs in [**2-23**] bottles and chronic foot ulcers were swabbed and
reportedly grew staph aureus with pending sensitivities. Zosyn
was thus discontinued. In the setting of infection, patient
became delirious, noted to be attempting to grab things from the
air and talking to people in the room. Of note, patient was
continued on narcotics, reportedly at the wife's insistence
given concern for narcotic withdrawal. Neurology was consulted
and recommended a head CT which was unremarkable, leaving them
to conclude that the mental status was toxic/metabolic in the
setting of infection and narcotic use. He was started on
Ceftriaxone 2 grams daily for CNS coverage though no LP was
performed. On day 5, patient was noted to develop acute renal
failure with a creatinine of 3, up from 1.3 and was also anuric.
CKs were checked to evaluate renal failure from rhabdomyolysis
and were not likely contributing at a level of 361. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of his renal failure
progressing to the point of needing HD, since [**Hospital3 77641**]
no HD facilities.
.
Upon arrival, patient was noted to vomit and had reportedly
vomited in route to [**Hospital1 18**]. He additionally started experiencing
low-amplitude, rhythmic clonus of his hands and legs, became
transiently hypoxic and was not verbally responsive. There was
concern for seizing and patient was urgently intubated to
protect his airway. Discussion with the patient's wife, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN,
revealed that the patient has never had a seizure disorder and
does not drink alcohol. Additionally, he had a CT scan with
contrast at [**Hospital1 2025**] 3 days prior to his admission to [**Hospital3 **]as a part of his RCC work-up and the wife expressed concern for
contrast-induced nephropathy. Patient was then ordered for a
stat head CT given the mental status and neurology was consulted
for further assistance with management.

For complete blood culture results, please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] and
ask for microbiology.

[**2165-4-21**] CXR: ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is approximately
45 mm from the carina, standard position. Lung volumes are low
and there are several areas of plate-like atelectasis. Heart
size borderline enlarged. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal.
No pneumothorax.

[**2165-4-21**] Abd XR: Diffuse colonic dilatation without air within
the rectum. This may represent ileus. Close followup is
recommended.

[**2165-4-21**] Left foot XR: The patient is status post partial
amputation of the first through fifth metatarsals and resection
of multiple phalanges. Portions of the 1st distal phalanx, the
toe of the second (?) digit, and the fifth toe are present.
There is a focus of air overlying the surgical bed of the first
ray, representing either air within an area of ulceration or
subcutaneous emphysema. There is relative lucency of the
adjoining portion of the first metatarsal bony remnant
suspicious for osteomyelitis.
Correlation with any previous (outside) radiographs and history
of recent
debridement is recommended for full assessment. The posterior
calcaneus is obscured by overlying material and not fully
evaluated on this examination.

[**2165-4-22**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

[**2165-4-22**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to
the pattern of widespread alpha range activity alternating with
relative suppression of the background without reactivity which
is suggestive of an alpha coma pattern. This abnormality
suggests a severe encephalopathy. Medications and metabolic
disturbances may be causes but this pattern can also be seen in
post-anoxic patients. There were no lateralized or epileptiform
features seen and no electrographic seizures were seen in this
recording.

[**2165-4-22**] Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis.

[**2165-4-22**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity enlargement and
preserved global  biventricular systolic function.

[**2165-4-25**] TEE: No intracardiac mass or vegetations. No significant
valvular regurgitation. Complex, mobile atheroma in descending
aorta, simple atheroma in the aortic arch.

[**2165-4-25**] MRI/MRV Head w/o Contrast: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarction.
2. Patent major dural venous sinuses. Decreased signal in the
posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus, includ
