NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT

FINDINGS: There is a large mixed density intraparenchymal
hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe at the site of prior
surgery displaying hematocrit levels. The size of the hemorrhage
itself measures approximately 4.9 x 5.4 cm not including the
marked adjacent edema. Additionally, there is interventricular
extension of hemorrhage tracking down into the fourth ventricle
and a mild-to- moderate sized right subdural likely acute on
chronic hematoma measuring approximately 6 mm from the inner
table with blood noted to track along the tentorium. Moderate
amount of dilatation of the left ventricular system is noted.
Subcutaneous air and a large subgaleal mixed density hematoma is
present adjacent to the craniotomy site. There is approximately
11 mm of leftward subfalcine herniation as well as mass effect
noted on the brainstem with slight effacement of the ambient
cistern consistent with mild uncal herniation. Paranasal sinuses
display mild amount of thickening within the left maxillary
sinus but are otherwise unremarkable.

Orogastric and endotracheal tubes are in place.

IMPRESSION:

1. Large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent
mass effect causing prominent leftward subfalcine herniation and
mild uncal herniation. Intraventricular extension of hemorrhage
with moderate left-sided hydrocephalus.

2. Acute on chronic right subdural hematoma over the right
cerebrum and new acute subdural hematoma along the falx and
tentorium.

3. Large mixed density subgaleal hematoma and subcutaneous air
adjacent to craniotomy site.

4. Findings are most consistent with hemorrhagic conversion of
patient's known metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

Findings discussed with the ordering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on date of exam at approximately 10:00 a.m.
