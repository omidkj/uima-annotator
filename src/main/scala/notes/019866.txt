Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
50 year old woman with PMH of COPD with multiple previous
intubations, IV drug use now on methadone, hepatitis C, seizure
disorder, and tobacco abuse presents with increasing shortness
of breath over last day. She reports an associated cough with
yellow/greenish sputum. She also had a migraine headache,
similar to her usual migraines, associated with nausea and
vomiting. She denies fevers, chills. She reports a history of
smoke exposure 2 days prior to prenetation when she was staying
with her sister who fell asleep with a cigarette, causing her
pillow to smoke and her apartment to fill with smoke.
On presentation to the ED her O2 sat was 67% but improved to 92%
on 2 liters of oxygen. ABG's demonstrated acidemia with
hypercarbia, and she was placed on CPAP and vomited. CXR was
grossly clear. Repeat ABG was 7.19/96/19 so she was intubated to
improve oxygenation and ventilation. Her BP dropped to 70-80's
systolic post intubation as during previous intubations so a
femoral line was placed and she was given 4 liters of NS. She
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory support.

CXR ([**2183-4-9**]): PA AND LATERAL CHEST: There has been interval
extubation. The lungs are hyperinflated. The diaphragms are
flattened and the retrosternal clear space is increased. There
is no focal air space consolidation. There is no effusion. There
is some linear atelectasis at both lung bases. There is no
pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Interval extubation without focal air
space consolidation to represent pneumonia or aspiration. No
CHF.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 46780**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], for a short course,
because of hypercarbic respiratory failure from a COPD
exacerbation. She required a short course of intubation and
mechanical ventiliation. Thereafter, she recovered to baseline
with steroids, nebulizers, and levofloxacin.

1) Resp Distress/COPD: Again, she had hypercarbic failure and
was initially intubated for a COPD exacerbation. Her CXR showed
only right basilar atelectasis and emphysema. An initial sputum
gram stain had 4+ GNRs but the subsequent culture was negative.
She initialyl had leukocytosis, but this also imprvoved. She was
given albuterol and atroven nebulizers and was transitioned from
solumedrol to a Prednisone taper. She was started on
Levofloxacin for a ten day course. Baseline PFTs were obtained,
but the results (which showed somewhat preserved lung volumes,
with marked decrease of her FEV1 and FEV1/FVC and DLCO) may not
have represented a true baseline given her resolving acute
pulmonary process. She was discharged with Pulmonary follow-up
and was given extensive counseling on smoking cessation - she
was started on Nicotine replacement.

2) Hypotension: Of note, the patient had a short episode of
hypotension in the ED after intubation. This responded to fluid
boluses. Her blood pressure was stable thereafter.
