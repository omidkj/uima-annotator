Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pulmonary intubation
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is intubated so all history was obtained via OSH
records and the patient's family. The patient is a 68 y/o man
with HTN, chronic etoh use, and recurrent UTIs, but no known
cardiac history, who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2109-9-2**]
complaining of shaking chills and malaise 1 day after heavy etoh
use at a golf tournament. Initial exam showed an afebrile,
somnolent, obese male with systolic BP bw 95-110, HR 100 with
extra systolic beats, resp rate of 22 and saturation at 98% on
NC. Only other exam finding was b/l ankle pitting edema. EKG
showed NSR with non specific ST-T changes. Troponins were 0.16,
0.12, 0.13, 0.14. CXR showed only cardiomegaly. Moments after
presentation he was found to be febrile (102 rectal temp),
agitated/tremulous, and hypotensive (systolics in the 80s). Pt
was treated with Ativan per the CIWA protocol as Etoh withdrawal
was suspected. On further evaluation, he was found to have
leukocytosis secondary to a UTI, and an elevated creatinine (1.4
->1.95). He was tranfered to the ICU given the suspicion of
urosepsis and was started on Vanc/Zosyn. He soon became
obtunded, hypoxic, and hypercarbic. Up to this point, he had
recieved a total of 6mg Ativan. He was sedated and intubated
with PRVC ventilator support. He remained febrile over the next
2 days despite pesistently negative blood cultures (x8) and his
Abx regimen was broadened to include
Vanc/Imipenem/Cilastin/Cipro. Urine culture grew pan sensitive
Ecoli >100,000 cfu/ml.
.
After initiation of ventilator support on [**2109-9-2**], he continued
to be hemodynamically unstable with SBPs in the 80s-90s despite
aggressive fluids. He was placed on dopamine 5 mcg/kg/min but
was pesistently hypotensive so dopamine was switched to
norepinephrine 8mcg/min. His hemodynamics improved to SBPs in
the 100s. An Echo on [**9-4**] showed an EF of 15%, severe diffuse LV
hypokinesis, mod diffuse RV hypokinesis, mod MR, mild-mod TR, no
pericardial effusion. His initial leukocytosis (10,000 wbc
today) and creatinine (1.65 today) have improved. He is afebrile
today with a Tm of 99.8. Patient is being transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for
more intensive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive diuresis (he
has gained 15lbs over the last 3 days) and possible baloon pump
placement.
.
ROS: Per report over the past 6 months he has had + Orthopnea
with patient frequently sleeping sitting up in chair. +
Peripheral Edema. + Irregular pulse, increased awareness of
heart beat. + exertional dyspnea. Otherwise no chest pain,
?paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac Cath
[**2109-9-12**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant systems

demonstrated no angiographyically-apparent flow limiting
stenosis. The
LMCA, LAD, LCX and RCA had no apparent flow limiting disease..
2.Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 22 mmHg and PCW of 37mmHg. There was
severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with PASP of 71 mmHg. The
cardiac
index was low at 1.8 L/min/m2. the pulmonary vascular resistance
was 261
dynes-sec/m5. There was no evidence of significant left to right

shunting under the loading conditions encountered.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Elevated biventricular pressures.
3. Mildly elevated systmeic arterial pressures.

Echo
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral
