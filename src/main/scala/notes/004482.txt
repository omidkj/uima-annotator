GI bleed

History of Present Illness:
77 y/o woman with Afib not on coumadin, dCHF, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, COPD, IBS, CKD, and myeloproliferative disorder
transferred from OSH for management of recurrent GI bleeding s/p
hemorrhoidectomy requiring multiple hospitalizations and
transfusions. The patient has had about 1.5 years of
intermittent GI bleeding, with painless BRBPR, maroon stools,
and clots, which worsened over past 4-5 months. Per report, she
has also had intermittent hematochezia. Colonoscopy on [**6-10**] at
OSH showed diverticulosis and hemorrhoids, which were believed
to be the source of the bleeding. She had large amounts of
rectal bleeding s/p hemorrhoidectomy on [**7-9**] and was transferred
to ICU of OSH from [**Date range (1) 9463**], where she received 7 units PRBC and
3 units FFP and Vit K. Last Hct was 30.7. Post-op, she was
started on flagyl x 5 days and levoquin for Klebsiella UTI. She
is s/p upper and lower endoscopy suggestive of duodenitis and
mild gastritis, colonoscopy, and a tagged RBC scan without clear
source (stomach or transverse colon). A second colonoscopy was
attempted but patient was unable to tolerate prep.

A hemodialysis trauma line was placed in the right IJ. Hct was
30.7. Her Cr was 1.5, INR 1.68, and WBC 21 (chronically elevated
WBC in 18) at OSH.

She was transferred to MICU for angiography to help localize
source of persistent GI bleed with the plan of returning to
outside hospital for non-emergent surgery if source cannot be
embolized.

Upon arrival to the floor, initial vs were T 96.3 F, HR 106 BP
127/57, RR 16, 95% on 3L NC.

Patient reports she has been incontinent of stool since
procedure.
She was guaiac positive without frank blood per rectum and was
given additional fluid given elevated Cr 1.5 in preparation for
angiography. She denied feeling lightheaded since this morning.
She has SOB, orthopnea, chronic hot flashes, night sweats, and
130 lb weight loss over past year. She denies fever or chills.
She has history of constipation and diarrhea. ROS otherwise
negative.

Imaging:
[**7-16**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly is less pronounced, and although
there is mild vascular engorgement in the upper lungs,
mediastinal veins are not dilated. Therefore, the
mild-to-moderate generalized pulmonary edema could be due to
transfusion reaction rather than the hemodynamic effect of blood
product administration. Dual-channel right supraclavicular line
ends in the upper right atrium. No pneumothorax. Pleural
effusions are minimal if any.
.
[**7-16**] CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. Non-contrast CT scan performed due to contrast allergy.
Significant
residual barium within the bowel is noted which limits
evaluation for GI
bleeding.
2. Splenomegaly measuring 15.5 cm.
3. Diverticulosis of descending colon and sigmoid colon without
evidence of acute diverticulitis.
4. Multiple compression fractures noted of T9, L1, L3 and L5
which are age
indeterminate.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right than
the left.
6. Severe four-chamber cardiac enlargement.
.
[**7-21**] Tagged RBC scan:
IMPRESSION: Moderate hemorrhage into the sigmoid colon beginning
15 minutes into the study.
.
[**7-21**] Angio:
FINDINGS:
1. [**Female First Name (un) 899**] gram demonstrated normal anatomy with opacification of
left colic,
sigmoidal, and superior rectal arterial branches.
2. Sigmoidal and superior rectal arteriograms demonstrated
contrast
extravasation in the region of distal rectum, associated with
some early
filling veins.
3. Following embolization of a superior rectal artery, there was
no contrast extravasation.
.
[**7-22**] KUB:
FINDINGS: There continues to be borderline dilatation of the
transverse
colon. This might be consistent with mild ileus. A small amount
of residual barium is still observed in the cecum or ascending
colon. No evidence of calcifications or free air.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o woman with Afib not on coumadin due to various bleeding
disorders, dCHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and
myeloproliferative disorder transferred from OSH for management
of several months of recurrent GI bleeding s/p hemorrhoidectomy,
massive transfusion protocol, and IR coiling of superior rectal
artery.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# GI Bleed: The patient was transferred from an outside hospital
with GI bleed requiring 7 units PRBCs.  Work-up at OSH included
upper and lower endoscopy, colonoscopy, and tagged RBC scan
unable to localize bleeding (either stomach or transverse
colon).  On admission, the patient had intermittent episodes of
bright red blood per rectum.  However, her hematocrit remained
stable.  She underwent a non-contrast CT that was limited by
residual barium in her intestines from a past study prior to
hospital transfer.  Gi
