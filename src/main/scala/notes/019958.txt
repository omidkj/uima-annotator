Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting, hematemasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD, arteriovenous graft revision, placement of tunnelled

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] is a 74 year old man with DM II c/b triopathy, CRI
on dialysis (baseline Cr 4), aortic stenosis, dilated CMP (EF
60%), and recent GI bleed who presents with nausea, coffee
ground emesis, poor po intake, increasing confusion, and
foul-smelling urine. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 4494**] in [**Location (un) 1514**] for vomiting and GI bleed from
[**Date range (3) 32041**]. Workup there included EGD which showed
"narrowing, causing him to throw up" and a colonoscopy which
showed "irritation, 80%-sure irritation and not cancer" per his
son. [**Name (NI) **] his son, both EGD and colonoscopy showed a source of
bleeding, but the patient did not require any transfusions. His
son noticed that his baseline mental status decreased while
admitted, as he was more confused and unable to answer questions
about his symptoms. He was discharged, and was initially
incontinent of stool and still confused but then began to be
more active with improved appetite after a week. He still
required his son to administer medications, a task the patient
had been able to do before. Last week, his son noticed that the
patient had poor po intake, and seemed weaker with less interest
in the TV. Four days ago, his son gave the patient a suppository
and saw a bit of "fresh blood". Last night, he observed his
father vomiting; this morning, the patient had coffee ground
emesis and his urine appeared dark brown and foul-smelling. He
was brought to the ED>

In the ED, VS: T 97.9 HR 80 BP 121/52 RR 20 O2 95% RA. He was
described as endorsing chest discomfort but not true chest pain.
EKG showed diffuse T wave flattening and CXR was negative. 1st
set of cardiac enzymes showed Troponin 0.10, which was decreased
compared to prior Troponin levels and consistent with decreased
clearance [**12-28**] to his poor renal function. He was given 325 mg
ASA. To evaluate for UGI bleed, NG lavage was performed which
was negative for bleed. Guaiac was positive with brown stool. He
received 4mg Zofran IV and 40 mg pantoprazole. U/A was obtained
given his foul-smelling urine, which was positive for UTI. He
received ciprofloxacin IV 400mg. He is admitted for r/o MI,
hydration given inability to tolerate POs, w/u of GI bleed, and
UTI.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was not complaining of
nausea, vomiting, or chest discomfort. His son had stepped out.
The patient was unsure of prior chest pain, SOB, hematemesis,
foul-smelling urine, or dysuria. When his son returned, he noted
that his father normally used a walker to ambulate and had not
had any falls in the past ~9 months. He is to have follow-up on
[**2144-5-13**] with GI for the "atypical cells" found on the
colonoscopy.

CXR [**5-3**]
CHEST, THREE VIEWS: There has been interval placement of an OG
tube with tip
and side hole projecting below the diaphragm. The heart size is
top normal
and unchanged as are mediastinal and hilar contours. There is no
pneumothorax
or pleural effusion. Right superior mediastinal fullness likely
relates to
tortuous vessels. No airspace opacification identified. The
pulmonary
vasculature is normal. No gross osseous abnormality.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Head CT [**5-3**]
FINDINGS: The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with
age-
appropriate atrophy. Periventricular white matter hypodensities
are noted,
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There is
no shift of
normally midline structures. Calcifications of the carotid
arteries are
noted. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There i
