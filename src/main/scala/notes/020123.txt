History of Present Illness:
56 yo man with no [**First Name3 (LF) 65**] PMH who was complaining of a headache at
the dentist today and was sent to an OSH where a right parietal
ICH was found.  He was
intubated for unclear reasons, but possibly due to decreasing
mental status, and sent here.  In speaking with his family, he
was apparently feeling well over the weekend without complaint.
His sister did tell me that he was hoarse when she spoke to him
and she was concerned about this.  When asked, he said it was
his normal voice, but she did not think this.  Then, yesterday
he apparently told his wife he had a mild headache, but did not
mention where or other characteristics.  He did not mention
other problems such as weakness, numbness, tingling, dysphagia,
or visual changes, but his family says he doesn't typically
complain. No recent weight loss.

He went to the dentist today and needed a tooth removed(? cause
of his earlier HA). Before this though, he was complaining of
severe right sided head/temple pain and the dentist sent him to
[**Hospital **] Hospital.  There, a 4x3 cm right parietotemporal
hematoma was seen with IV spread to the lateral ventricle.  He
apparently became more obtunded and was intubated. His BPs there
were reportedly 200/100s.  He was sent here and seen by the
neurosurgery team who will admit him.  He was loaded with
dilantin and will be monitored in the ICU.  He is currently
sedated on the vent.

Past Medical History:
None known, but pt does not see doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 30449**].

Social History:
Lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] drinks occ.  He smokes "heavily" for at
least 40 years.

Family History:
Unknown

Head CT: Large 4.2 x 3.1 cm hemorrhagic mass centered in the
right parietal lobe with surrounding edema and shift of the
midline leftward 7 mm causing subfalcine herniation.  An
underlying mass cannot be excluded with this study.  *The volume
is ~60 cc and it extends into the right lateral vent, but not
the 3rd or 4th.

Repeat HCT [**12-14**]: This study is unchanged from previous. Again
noted is large parenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal
lobe displaying a hyperdense hemorrhagic center with hypodense
rim of vasogenic edema. Intraventricular hemorrhage is again
noted with the majority of blood within the right lateral
ventricle and no change in ventricular size to suggest
developing hydrocephalus. Leftward subfalcine herniation is
unchanged in size or appearance. Surrounding osseous and soft
tissue structures are within normal limits.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are no pathologically
enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes. There are
no pleural or cardial effusions. There are bilateral lower lobe
infiltrates, right greater than left. There are no discrete
nodules. The pulmonary arteries are normal. There is
atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch. An
endotracheal and NG tube appeared in satisfactory position.
There are 5-mm pretracheal, precarinal, and AP window lymph
nodes.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There are two low attenuations
within the liver, one within segment 2 and a smaller one is
within segment 4. These are too small to accurately
characterize, but could represent cysts. The left kidney is
smaller than the right. The left renal artery is patent,
although there may be mild narrowing at the origin. There is a
1-cm rounded area of low attenuation in the upper pole of the
right kidney, too small to characterize. The gallbladder is not
distended, and is without stones. There are no discrete
pancreatic masses. However, in the region of the pancreatic head
and second portion of the duodenum, there is some free fluid and
inflammatory fat stranding. There are small adjacent lymph
nodes. There is also some free fluid within the mesentery and
right pericolic gutter. There is no free air. There are no
dilated loops of large or small bowel. There is atherosclerotic
calcification and mural thrombus of the descending aorta. The
adrenal glands are normal. There is a small low attenuation at
the lower pole of the right kidney, too small to characterize.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon are
normal. There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
There is a Foley catheter within the bladder. The prostate is
normal. There is no lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lesions. Well-defined sclerotic
focus in the right humerus likely a bone island.

IMPRESSION:
1. No discrete masses within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Bilateral lower lobe pulmonary infiltrates. Etiologies
include possible infection, aspiration, or atelectasis.
3. Fluid and inflammatory change in the peripancreatic region,
with fluid in the mesentery. Query pancreatitis. Clinical
correlation is recommended. 4. Two low attenuations within the
liver, too small to characterize.
5. Two low attenuations within the right kidney, too small to
characterize.

Brief Hospital Course:
56yo man with no [**Month/Day (2) 65**] PMH who was complaining of a headache at
the dentist and was sent to an OSH where a right parietal ICH
was found with intraventricular extension. He was intubated and
sedated and admitted to the ICU. Etiology of hemorrhage was
thought to be hypertensive hemorrhage, as he is blood pressure
was very difficult to control in the ICU. He had no evidence of
malignancy on torso CT. MRI should be performed in [**7-20**] weeks to
allow the blood to clear prior to evaluating for any other mass
or evidence of amyloid angiopathy.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. ICH: In the ICU, he was monitored for neurologic status and
was found to improve slowly. His SBP was controlled < 150. He
was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis for goal level
[**12-1**]. He was treated for a week with mannitol as well. He
improved while in the ICU and was able to be extubated.

2. Fever: He had a fever thought to be secondary to his dental
abscess. He was started on augmentin, with zosyn added for
persistent fever on [**12-16**], discontinued on [**12-22**].  He initially
continued to have a leukocytosis with a mild cough.  A CXR was
obtained, which was negative.  Dental films are done with
results pending.  Leukocytosis has been resolving and he has
remained afebrile.

3. Atrial fibrillation: He was found to be in atrial
fibrillation on [**12-16**]. Anticoagulation could not be started given
his hemorrhage. His rate was controlled with amiodarone and
metoprolol.

4. HTN: In the ICU his SBP was maintained < 150 on a nipride
drip. In order for this to be weaned off ([**12-22**]), he required
multiple medications.  Prazosin is in the process of being
weaned off and well be discontinued by the time of discharge.
Clonidine will also need to be weaned off (taper outlined in
discharge orders).  His Lisinopril can be titrated for blood
pressure control and spironolactone can be started.
