Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Pulmonary Embolus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial Line Placement

History of Present Illness:
74 yo f with hx of dementia, transfered from OSH today after
cardiac arrest. Pt was found to be complaining of feeling dizzy
and SOB at her NH, then was found down. CPR was initiated at the
NH, she was intubated in the field and given atropine x2 and epi
x 4 enroute to OSH. She arrived with PEA arrest. She was coded,
after multiple rounds of atropine and epi, went to VF and was
shocked x 1, then returned to PEA. After more CPR and epi, dopa,
calcium gluconate, and bicarb the pt returned to a sinus tach
with perfusion. Cooling began in ER with return of pulse. Code
lasted about 30 min in ER + time in field. After CPR she had a
subclavial line attempted on the right resulting in a
pneumothorax. She was on 3 pressors, then a chest tube was
placed with BP improvment. CT of the chest showed a large almost
saddle right sided PE with multiple small right PEs. She had a
femoral line placed. She was started on heparin due to the PE.
Pt was given flagyl, zosyn. She had possible seizure activity
prior to trasfer and was given ativan x 1. ABG at 19:55 had a ph
of 7.04.
.
Upon arrival in the MICU, she had a BP in 80s, that then
declined to the 50s. She was on dopa gtt, levo gtt, and heparin.
Neo was started on arrival with improvment of BP. A-line was
placed. ABG showed pH still at 7.01 and PO2 of 40, so bicarb was
restarted.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-1-27**]):
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    ~4000/ML.

Blood Cultures: Pending

Studies:
The current study demonstrates the right chest tube in place
with no apparent right pneumothorax, although small pneumothorax
can be obscured by significant amount of subcutaneous air. The
ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the
proximal stomach and might be advanced another 10 cm. There is a
lucency surrounding the aortic arch that potentially might
represent small amount of pneumothorax. Minimal left apical
pneumothorax also cannot be excluded. Currently, the amount of
subcutaneous air is higher on the left than on the right. The
left basal opacity has some triangular appearance and most
likely a combination of consolidation and atelectasis of the
left lower lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo f with hx of dementia, now s/p cardiac arrests in setting
of PE and PEA arrest, with pneumothorax s/p chest tube, now
intubated and unresponsive having myoclonic jerks.

# Hypotension/Cardiac arrest: Secondary to large PE. Pt had a
prolonged arrest and is continuing to have hypotension. On
admission patient was continued on Levophed and Dopamine,
Neosynepherine was started. CE at the OSH and her CK here are
elevated, likely secondary to her CPR, but ischemia can not be
excluded. She was at risk for hypoperfussion induced cardiac
ischemic injury. Pt cooled to temp of 92 at OSH, now at 94.
However, due to PE and prolonged code and time since her code
patient was not a good candidate for cooling protocol given
concern for coagulopathy and overall poor outcome. Patient was
monitored on telemetry and started on a bicarb gtt given her
profound acidosis. The patient's extremly poor prognosis was
shared with the family and it was determined that the patient
would be made Comfort Measures Only. Patient pasted shortly
after being made CMO.

# Pulmonary embolism: Pt had a large right PE and this likely
triggered the cardiac arrest. She was started on heparin at the
OSH. Unclear her risk factors for PE or if she had any clots in
the past. Continued heparin gtt. No thrombolysis given extremely
poor prognosis.

# Altered mental status/myoclonic jerks: Pt was unresponsive to
all stimuli except a minimal amount of pupilary constriction.
This was likely [**1-31**] both her prolonged hypoperfusion during her
code likely causing anoxic brain injury and her elevated lactate
causing a significant metabolic acidosis. Pt is overbreathing
the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she does retain some brain function. Whe initially
had jerks on her left side but these generalized over the course
of her admission. Unclear if she had a hx of sz, since the pt
was on depakote at her NH. Her head CT at [**Hospital1 **] had no
significant findings, but was likely too soon after her event to
show anoxic injury. Sedation was held and metabolic
abnormalities were corrected.

# Acidosis: Metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. Lactate
is likely causing her AG acidosis. It was 8 on arrival. She is
also CO2 retaining despite her elevated RR. Bicarb gtt continued
until pH>7.2.

# Pneuomthorax: Secondary to subcalvian line placement attempt
on right. Chest tube is currently in place. CXR with decreasing
pneumo. Pt has extensive subcutanteous air on chest wall.
Further Pneumothorax noted on the left surronding the aortic
arch. Left sided pneumothorax was small and did not reguire
chest tube.

# Coagulopathy: Likely in setting of shock, fibrinogrin likely
low due to clot formation. Coags and bleeding monitored.

# Hypertension: Held home lasix, atenolol, nifedipine, and
lisinopril

# Dementia: Unsure her baseline, currently unresponsive.
