History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo female with pmhx of T1-T2 paraplegia,
frequent admissions for pna and UTI, chronically on 2L NC at
home for COPD. She is presenting for increasing oxygen
requirement, cough. Her baseline is 90-95% on 2L and she
desatted to the 85% on 5L and was satting in the 80s on Venturi
mask. The patient's PCA attempted nebs and chest PT without
improvement this am so brought her into the hospital. She had
developed an increased oxygen requirement starting 2 days prior
to admission and had slowly increased to 5L at time of
presentation. The patient denies shortness of breath and says
that she feels well. She also denies fevers. She denies chest
pain and abdominal pain. She denies fevers (she did have low
grade fevers last week when she was dx with UTI but not over the
weekend). She does say that she has been having productive cough
and an associated sore throat. She does endorse wheezing.
.
Of note, she presented to the ED on [**2-23**] with c/o aspiration on
[**2-22**] and productive cough. At that time, her CXR looked
non-infected and unchanged from prior but her UA was positive.
Given her frequent resistant UTIs, she was started on cefepime
[**Hospital1 **] for 7 days (day 1 [**2-23**]). She continued to spike low grade
fevers to 99.5 and complained of incontinence and large volumes
of urine even while on abx. This resolved by 4 days prior to
admission and she reports that her urinary function has returned
back to her baseline.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  107/59 HR 83 99% ON NRB with RR of
14. CVL in place. She was started on Combivent x3 and Solumedrol
125mg. A CXR revealed worsening RLL infiltrate. She received
levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl, she had been receiving
cefepime for UTI. In the ED, she was placed on NRB satting 97%.
Her hematocrit was noted to be 28.1, which is her baseline.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  the patient is satting 95% on face mask
12L O2. She appears comfortable but is anxious and easily
tearful. She endorses chronic bilateral foot pain, which has
been ongoing but is otherwise comfortable. She does endorse nose
congestion. She also endorses constipation, with last BM on
Tuesday (6 days ago).

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo female with hx of T1/T2 paraplegia, frequent
UTI/aspiration pneumonias who is presenting with hypoxemia,
cough, multilobar peumonia. The patient did not have a
leukocytosis and was afebrile but she was requiring 10L on face
mask to maintain oxygenation. Her CXR revealed multilobar
pneumonia and the patient endorsed previous history of
aspiration one week prior to presentation. She had MRSA positive
sputum in [**2149-12-2**] so she was started on Vanc, and given
her hx of aspiration, she was also started on Zosyn. She
received nebs and was able to wean her oxygen requirement to 2L
NC, which is her baseline home requirement. The patient had been
to the ED the week prior and was found to have positive UA, no
UCx was sent at the time, and she was started on IV cefepime
based on sensitivies from previous UTIs, she had completed 6 out
of 7 days of cefepime at time of presentation and was
transitioned to Zosyn, as above. The patient has a PICC line and
she was discharged to complete an 8 day course of antibiotics.
On discharge, the patient was on her home O2 requirement.
