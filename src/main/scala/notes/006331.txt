History of Present Illness:
Initial patient contact: [**2162-5-31**] 8:30pm
Primary oncologist: [**Doctor Last Name **]

71M with NSCLC p/w fever, myalgias, cough and shortness of
breath. Patient reports he was in his USOH until this past
Thursday when he received cycle 3 of chemotherapy (carboplatin).
Following chemotherapy, he developed nausea/vomiting and general
malaise, which he experienced with his prior cycles. On Thursday
night, he reports that his heat was shut off, and he stated that
night he felt cold all night. The next day he developed
chills/?subjective fevers, associated with a new (Vs. worsened)
non-productive cough and profound malaise and arthralgias. He
states that since this time he has had persistent nausea, though
has been able to take pos, and continues to have fatigue,
myalgias, subjective fevers, and shortness of breath, which
necessitated increasing his home O2 requirement to 3L.  He notes
that he has had a stuffy nose as well, but has not had purulent
mucus production. He does also report a frontal headache, but
denies photophobia or neck stiffness. He denies arthritis or a
rash. He notes that his wife has been sick with a viral illness
recently.  Given his constellation of symptoms, he called his
doctor and came to the ED.

In Ed: T101.1 174/106 108 26 96%RA. Received 1gm Tylenol,
oxycodone 5mg, Zofran, Percocet 2 tabs, ceftriaxone 1g,
vancomycin 1g

Upon arrival to floor, patient notes that he continues to feel
unwell with fatigue, myalgias, cough and mild shortness of
breath. He also notes persistent mild epigastric pain and new
mild sore throat.

ROS: Noteable for recurrent sharp chest pain, abd pain, chronic
back pain. Denies dysuria, change in bladder or bowel habits.
Has history of peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain that has
not been characterized completely. All other review of systems
otherwise begative.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Presented in [**9-/2161**] with one month productive cough, dyspnea,
and wheeze. Chest x-ray revealed a right upper consolidation and
fullness in the right hilum. He received a course of
antibiotics, but repeat x-ray on [**2161-2-26**] showed worsening of
the right upper lobe infiltrate and persistence of the right
hilar mass. The presence of the mass confirmed on CT and PET
scans. In addition to the right hilar mass, there was
radiographic evidence involving the bilateral hilar and right
mediastinal lymph nodes. Multiple nodules were seen on PET scan,
although they were not FDG avid. However, they were of small
size. Endobronchial biopsy [**11-27**] revealed squamous cell
carcinoma at least in situ with foci suspicious but not
definitive for invasion. Endobronchial biopsy of right upper
lobe and four lymph nodes on [**2162-1-1**] revealed squamous cell
carcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue. During the workup for
his non-small cell lung cancer, Mr. [**Known lastname 13440**] was found to have a
vocal cord mass, although biopsy of this has been unsuccessful,
but on [**2162-1-26**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] perform microlaryngoscopy and
biopsy of the right true and false vocal cords and
esophagoscopy. Pathology revealed papillary squamous
proliferative lesion, mild focally moderate dysplasia and
squamous mucosa with epithelialhyperplasia, hyperkeratosis,
parakeratosis, and mild dysplasia. On [**2162-1-19**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**]
ultrasound-guided thoracentesis of the right side, draining two
liters of clear serous fluid and rigid bronchoscopy with stent
placement in the bronchus ntermedius. Flexible bronchoscopy on
[**2162-2-11**] revealed occlusion n the right upper lobe bronchus by
tumor and the previously placed stent was cannulated. Rigid
pleuroscopy, pleural biopsy, tube thoracostomy, and Pleurx
catheter placement. Pleurx catheter was placed on [**2162-2-17**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 13440**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a PET scan on [**2162-3-23**]. This showed
increase in size of the prominent right upper lobe. The
FDG-avid mass, which had increased in size from 13.1 x 7.2 cm to
14.4 x 8.1 cm with SUV max of 18.7 from 13.2. The mass caused
obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus. There were
multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe, left upper
lobe, and left lower lobe with some of these nodules having
central calcifications suggesting granuloma. None of the nodules
were FDG avid. There was persistent mediastinal and right hilar
lymphadenopathy, pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the left
lower paratracheal region with FDG uptake. Large FDG avid lymph
nodes at the right hilum formed conglomerate mass surrounding
the right upper lobe bronchus with most of the lymph nodes
increasing in FDG size and avidity. In the abdomen, there were
new FDG avid lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and mesenteric
stations. Patient is currently carboplatin AUC 6 IV and
paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks for [**4-5**] cycles. Last chemo
cycle 3 on [**2162-5-27**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 71 year old male with metastatic squamous lung ca
s/p C3 carboplatin and paclitaxel who presented with
hypoglycemic syncope and resolved respiratory symptoms off abx
and on a reduced lantus dose.
.
# Hypoglycemic syncope / DM2 -  In the unit, she had a BS of 46
and was symptomatic, but no syncope, improved to 108. poor po
intake. hypoglycemia work-up random cortisol, TSH wnl. sugars
continued to drop due to evening lantus night prior and poor po
intake. Another differential is that the mediastinal mass could
be stimulating the vagus nerve and causing vasovagal syncope,
but have similiar prodromal symptoms, but blood sugars
correlating to symptoms suggest former as etiology. Lantus was
reduced from 30 units at night to 5 units at night.
.
# Resolved respiratory symptoms / COPD - on baseline home O2 of
3L for COPD. No significant change in co
