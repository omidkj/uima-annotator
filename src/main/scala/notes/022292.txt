CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2158-3-10**]
PORTABLY AP CHEST X-RAY: Interval placement of a tracheostomy
tube. There has been interval removal of an NG tube. No
pneumothorax is identified. No definite subcutaneous air is
seen. Mediastinal contour and cardiac contours are unchanged.
Again seen are alveolar opacities bilaterally, but much more
prominent on the left. This is not significantly changed from
prior exam.

IMPRESSION:

Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube and removal of an ET
tube and NG tube. No definite pneumothorax or subcutaneous air
identified. The exam is not significantly changed.

EKG Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2158-3-1**] the rate has increased. No evidence of acute or old
ischemia

1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is very difficult to assess
but is probably
normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course outlined by problem below:

# Respiratory failure- multifactorial. Has restrictive
(charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragmatic weakness s/p
plication, right upper lobectomy, on CPAP at home at night) and
obstructive (COPD) components. Also has had two recent
consecutive aspiration pneumonias. Sputum w/ acinobacter at osh,
now w/oroflora. At [**Hospital1 18**], sputums only grew out oropharyngeal
flora.  He was continued on levo, and vancoand showed
imporovement in respiratory status.  He was extubated on  [**3-5**]
however he showed progressive resp distress over the next 2 days
requiring reintubation.  CXR showed worsening left sided
pneumonia and he had a leukocytosis.  REmained afebrile.  Flagyl
was added and he responded well with decreasing WBC and
decreased respiratory distress.  He underwent tracheostomy and
was able to tolerate minimal pressure support by the time of
discharge on PSV 5/5 for period of time and allowed to rest on
higher pressure support.  He received steroids for his COPD and
which has now been tapered off.  His vanc, levo, flagyl will be
continued unitl  [**2158-3-19**].  Given his reestrictive disease
(charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragm disease, and new right
lobectomy) he will liklely need longterm support with
ventilation.

## sedation - did well with haldol standing order.  This may be
stopped if he tolerates his trach without aggitation.  He
sundowns so may require it at night.

# Hypotension - he was received on pressors, but these were
rapidly titrated off and he maintained good blood pressures.  He
was given a short course of stress dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg
qid both for his hypotension at the OSH and his COPD
exacerbation).

# NSTEMI- asa, bb. s/p cards consult, r-sided ekg nl. Liekly was
demand ischemiea in the setting of his hypotension.  His echo,
albeit of poor quality shows a normal EF and no WMA.  He was
started on a beta blocker, aggressive statin, ASA.  He will need
an ACEI for long term benefit of his CAD.  He was diuresed until
euvolemic which imporved his hypoxia.  Would continue to diurese
until patient BUN/Cre bump.

# Lung cancer-Stage 2-poor prognosis with 20-30% chance for cure
with surgery alone. Adjuvent chemo would only add an additional
5% chance for cure. Heme-onc consult discussed prognosis with
family and as of discharge the pt not aware of the final path
results yet. He can follow up with the [**Hospital 3782**] [**Hospital 25568**] clinic for
further follow up.
