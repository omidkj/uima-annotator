Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
25 yo female with past medical history of asthma complicated by
multiple intubation and IV drug abuse complicated by septic
shock and septic arthritis. Patient was sent from [**Hospital1 **] for
ED evaluation of pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted
to be low. She was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] earlier today
([**2143-1-9**]) after a two day stay for toxic ingestion of
hydroxyzine. Was discharged back to [**Hospital1 **] after note of CXR
showing multifocal pneumonia and was subsequently started on
levofloxacin 750 mg PO for a planned 7 day course. Had fevers at
[**Hospital **] rehab today and report of decreased oxygen
saturation. Patient notes a cough which is now productive,
though she is unable to clarify whether cough is different from
her chronic cough.

In the emergency department, initial vitals were: T 101.8, HR
146, BP 129/107, RR 26, 85% RA. Was persistently tachycardic in
ED (sinus per EKG). Received levofloxacin at [**Hospital1 **]. In the
ED received vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Additionally, was given
lorazepam 2 mg IV x 1. Report by word of mouth through nursing
staff was that patient had acute mental status change after a
trip to bathroom in the ED. Prior to transfer to the ICU vitals
were: HR 120s, BP 117/97, RR 25, O2Sat 97% 4L NC.

Studies:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2143-1-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Perihilar ground-glass opacities with
bronchiectasis, and a more focal area of opacification in the
right lower lobe. Findings could reflect multifocal infection,
or drug reaction, combined with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

ECG [**2143-1-7**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Modest ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the
previous tracing of [**2142-10-5**] sinus tachycardia rate is faster and
modest
ST-T wave changes are present.

Chest Xray [**2143-1-9**]:
Single AP portable view of the chest is obtained. There is
persistent bilateral lung opacities worrisome for pneumonia.
There is no significant change from prior study. There is a
small right pleural effusion. Heart size cannot be assessed.
Mediastinal contour is grossly stable. There is no pneumothorax.
Right posterior upper rib fractures are again noted.

CT chest:
1. Bilateral ground-glass opacities, new pneumatoceles, focal
areas of
atelectais-consolidation, Chronic mild upper lobe
bronchiectasis, and focal air trapping as described above.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious causes
such as atypical viral/bacterial pneumonia including PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] edema secondary to drug reaction, chronic changes
secondary to patient's known hypogammaglobulinemia, or collagen
vascular disease such as goodpasture's syndrome. Exposure to
recreational drugs might be considered as well. Overall the
findings have progressed since the prior study obtained in
[**2141-8-25**].

2. Chronic mild upper lobe bronchiectasis and bronchial wall
thickening may be secondary to asthma or patient's known
hypogammaglobulinemia.

3. New pneumatoceles may be sequale of prior infection or active
infection
such as PCP.

4. Marked osteopenia with multiple stable vertebral body
compression fractures and old rib fractures.

Discharge labs:


Brief Hospital Course:
25 year old female with past medical history of asthma
complicated by multiple intubations and IV drug abuse
complicated by septic shock and septic arthritis. She was sent
from [**Hospital1 **] for ED evaluation of pneumonia after her oxygen
saturation was noted to be low.

#. Hypoxia, fevers:  She was found to have possible multifocal
pneumonia on CXR, she was initially treated broadly with
Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin, which was then narrowed to
Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone and changed to Levofloxacin and
Cefpodoxime before dischage (planned last day [**1-15**]).  Blood
cultures were sent and are pending.  Sputum culture was
negative.  She had a CT chest which showed ground glass
opacities bilaterally possibly reflecting infection vs
drug-induced lung injury.  She was treated with nebulizer
treatments and a short course of prednisone for possible
contribution of her underlying asthma.  Patient was originally
started on Tamiflu but then tested negative for influenza and
her tamiflu was stopped.  Attempted ICU consent with patient
over course of stay however too somnolent at first and then
refused to discuss bec
