Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous coronary intervention
Intubation in the CCU
A-line placement in the CCU

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105222**] is a 67 yo man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2172**] with re-do
in [**2-/2180**] admitted to [**Hospital 1121**] Hospital on [**7-15**] for "sudden
onset shortness of breath."  At that time, he complained of
diaphoresis but denied chest pain.  He was found to have
pulmonary edema and was given lasix, aspirin, and nitro.  He
required intubation in the ED, with an ECG showing RBBB and
ST-elevations.  He was given azithromycin and rocephin for
question of infiltrate on CXR.
.
Following intubation and initiation of propofol, his SBP dropped
to the 80s and he had bradycardia with subsequent asystole.  He
received CPR for 8-10 minutes and was transferred to the ICU
where he was started on cardiac cooling and initiated on
dopamine gtt. UOP was approximately 30cc/hr, CEs showed trops
0.2 to 0.4 with flat CK.  Cardiology was consulted and the
patient was started on a heparin gtt for presumed ACS.  He was
diagnosed with "CHF with flash pulmonary edema" s/p cardiac
arrest. [**Month/Year (2) **] was done that showed EF of 30% with severe MR,
inferior akinesis and hypokinesis. Creatinine was up to 3.6 from
the patient's baseline of ~3. There was concern for "anoxic
encephalopathy" but neurology consult was deferred due to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.
.
At time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, he was intubated and moving
all extremities but not responsive.  He was afebrile with a SBP
of 110/70, HR 80, ambu-bag with transition to vent, RIJ in
place, with dopamine drip running.
.
Of note, he had been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU [**2180-2-23**] with DOE after
having been previously evaluated at [**Hospital3 1443**] for
concern for unstable angina.

MRI Chest [**2180-7-19**]
FINDINGS: There is no thoracic aortic dissection. The thoracic
aorta is normal in caliber throughout. Ascending aorta measures
approximately 3.2 cm in caliber. Incidental note is made of an
aberrant right subclavian artery.
The pulmonary artery is normal in caliber, with the main
pulmonary artery
measuring approximately 2.7 cm.  The heart is not enlarged.
There is no pericardial effusion. Note is made of mitral
regurgitation. There is bilateral, right greater than left,
effusions and atelectasis / consolidation.  Note is made of a
sternotomy, consistent with history of previous CABG. Please
note that the graft is not evaluated.  Renal arteries cannot be
assessed due to patient's inability to tolerate further
scanning. Limited views of the kidneys from a localizer images
demonstrate atrophy of the left kidney. Left kidney measures
approximately 7 cm in length. Right kidney measures
approximately 9 cm in length.
IMPRESSION:
1. No thoracic aortic dissection or aneurysm.
2. Bilateral, right greater than left, effusions and atalectasis
versus
consolidation.
3. Mitral regurgitation.

RENAL U/S [**2180-7-19**]
FINDINGS:
The right kidney measures 9.6 cm. Normal color vascularity and
waveforms are seen throughout the right kidney. The study of the
left kidney is somewhat limited. The cortex is thinned. The left
kidney measures 7.6 cm. There is a cyst located in the mid
portion of the kidney measuring 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.9 cm and is stable
in appearance. A normal sharp systolic upstroke is seen in the
left main renal artery with a peak systolic velocity of 46
cm/sec, essentially unchanged since the prior scan. Intrarenal
waveforms on the left kidney are limited. The left renal vein is
patent.
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study of the left kidney. Normal waveforms in the
left renal
artery, not significantly changed since prior scan. Left renal
vein patent.
2. Left renal cyst, unchanged.

CARDIAC CATH [**2180-7-20**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated native 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
was
patent. The LAD was occluded at the ostium with disteal vessel
filled
via SVG wth no significant distal disease. The LCX had 95%
proximal
lesion with vessel filling AV LCX and collaterals to distal RCA.
The
grafted OM branches were occluded from the LCX. The RCA was not
injected. The PDA was a small vessel filled from SVG and the
distal RCA
was occluded filing faintly from the SVG-RPDA and from the LCX
collaterals. The SVG-D1 from initial CABG revealed mild disease.
The
SVG-OM from prior CABG revealed long segment with mid disease to
60% and
distally filled very small segment of OM. The SVG-LAD was
normal. The
SVG-RPDA had long segment proximal/mid idsease to less than 50A%
filled
small PDA. The SVG-OM had proximal 70% stenosis and 95% lesion
just
distal to the SVG in OM.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The left sided
filling
pressures were elevated measuring 24mmHg. The systemic arterial
pressures were normal measuring 119/51mmHg. There were no
significant
gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter
from the
left ventricle into the ascending aorta.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the SVG-OM with 2.25x8mm
Minivision
stent and a 2.5x12mm Xience stent whi
