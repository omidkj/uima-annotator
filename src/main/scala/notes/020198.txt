CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Question ischemic bowel, Tylenol toxicity
and acute liver failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented on [**2165-4-7**] as a 59 year-old female with diabetes mellitus,
chronic renal insufficiency, depression admitted to the
[**Hospital3 35813**] Center on [**4-4**] after she was found
unresponsive and found to have a Tylenol overdose with a
level of 123 with resulting acute liver injury and metabolic
acidosis. She became unresponsive the day prior to admission
and was intubated and required Levophed for hypotension and
was started on Zosyn for questionable pneumonia. Patient had
a high lactate and was profoundly hypotensive and acidotic
and a CT of her abdomen was obtained and contained
pneumatosis and was concerning for ischemia and surgical
consult was obtained on [**2165-4-7**] after hepatology had
already seen the patient and assessed her medical condition.
The patient was housed in the medical intensive care unit at
this time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for Tylenol overdose,
depression, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, chronic
renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, peptic
ulcer disease and pericardial effusion.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy [**84**] years ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, Norvasc, Plavix, aspirin, Glipizide,
Neurontin, amitriptyline, Lopressor, Zocor and Lantus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former smoker, lives with daughter.

MEDICATIONS IN HOUSE:  At time of presentation Levophed .108
and insulin, lactulose, Mucomyst, vitamin K, fludrocortisone,
hydrocortisone, Zosyn, Pepcid, Flagyl.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission temperature
was 100.6, 83 in sinus rhythm, 108/50, 18, 97% on CVP 11. She
had respiratory rate of 18 at 40% with blood gases 7.32, 22,
154, 12 and -12. She was intubated. Pupils were reactive.
Coarse breath sounds bilaterally. She was regular rate and
rhythm. Abdomen was obese, soft. She had an upper midline
incision. Her extremities were well perfused.

White count on admission 22.3, hematocrit 27.9, platelets
241. PT 19.4, PTT 37.2, INR 2.4. Chemistries: 142, 3.9, 105,
10, 62, 5.7 and 125. Urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte
esterase with large white count. ALT 24, 13, AST was 26, 78,
alkaline phosphatase 115, total bilirubin .6, amylase of 84,
lipase was also normal. CK was 766, MB was 20, troponin was
.21. Albumin was 2, acetaminophen was 27.7, cortisol was
49.4, lactate was 5.7 at time of presentation. Chest x-ray
showed left circumferential cardiac opacity. CT of the
abdomen showed thickening of the ascending, transverse and
descending colon. Rectum was spared with pneumatosis in the
ascending colon. CT of her head showed no hemorrhage,
multiple hypodensities consistent with prior infarct.

In summary, patient is a 59 year-old female in multisystem
organ failure and acidosis admitted with a Tylenol overdose.
The patient has encephalopathy and renal failure and
respiratory failure with hypotension which could have been a
possible cause for her bowel ischemia. Patient's clinical
condition improved, however, somewhat. By hospital day 2 she
was off of pressors and was now on Zosyn and Flagyl for
antibiotic prophylaxis with a lactate that had dome down to
4.3. Operating room was postponed for that day. Renal
continued to see patient throughout her hospital course as
did hepatology team. On hospital day 3 patient had decreasing
transaminases, however, increasing white count and green
surgery service was consulted at that time under Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] care with the clinical scenario of hypotension in
the setting of an intubated patient where clinical
examination was not accurate and CT scan finding of
pneumatosis with high white count and high lactate. Patient
was taken to the operating room for an exploratory
laparotomy. For operative details please operative note.
Grossly, however, patient was found to have a large amount of
dead nonviable bowel and underwent total colectomy on [**2165-4-9**]. After surgery patient went to the Intensive Care
Unit on [**2165-4-9**] in critical condition. Due to the
patient's unresponsiveness neurology was consulted on [**4-10**] and did an EEG which showed diffuse encephalopathy without
focal slowing and they suggested that patient had likely
suffered a significant anoxic brain injury during the
hypotensive event intraoperatively which was evidenced by
parallel end organ damage, kidney, liver and bowel. Patient
continued in the unit of [**2165-4-10**] and continued to
become more acidotic receiving bicarb. Patient had an MRI of
her head which showed probable anoxic encephalopathy and
patient had ventilator weaned to CPAP by hospital day 6.
Patient continued to do well on the ventilator but mental
status was still not clear. Patient started on hemodialysis
and tolerated it well by [**2165-4-14**]. Had large ileostomy
output. Patient was thought by renal to have acute and
chronic kidney injury and remained off of pressors at this
time. Trial  of extubation was done on [**2165-4-16**]. Patient
extubated well without event. On [**2165-4-15**] stroke consult
continued consult on patient and patient was transferred to
the floor on [**2165-4-18**] without event.

Patient was started on tube feeds 30 cc an hour on [**2165-4-18**]. Physical therapy continued to see patient throughout
the case. Patient developed bilateral pleural effusions with
E coli, urosepsis on [**2165-4-19**] treated appropriately. CT of
the abdomen and pelvis was obtained. No signs of infection
were found. Psychiatry followed up consultation seeing
patient [**2165-4-18**] and patient continued to tolerate
hemodialysis well. Patient was started on HEP-locked IV and
renal diet on [**2165-4-20**]. C difficile x3 were sent and were
negative. White count was increasing on [**2165-4-18**].
Nutrition continued to see patient throughout her hospital
course. Patient developed a pelvic abscess and underwent
drainage. Wound VAC was placed and was changed on a q 3 day
basis growing on MRSA. Patient was on vancomycin essentially
2 week course and was discontinued from the vancomycin [**2166-5-20**]. Lines were changed. Tips were sent for culture.
Patient continued to tolerate dialysis. Zosyn was added for
abscess cavity drainage. Wound care nurses were seeing
patient for ostomy care. Patient went back to the operating
room on [**2165-5-12**] for wound debridement and ostomy
revision and exploration of the wound by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**]. It was
uneventful. Patient's wound VAC was then replaced and
continued to be changed on q.d. basis. Vancomycin and
Levaquin were given for culture and sensitivity of urinary
tract infection and MRSA. Vancomycin was just on a level low
maintenance after hemodialysis. Patient was continued to be
screened for rehabilitation. Patient went to the operating
room on [**2165-5-21**] for Perm-A-Cath placement. Patient
ultimately improved. Antibiotics were discontinued on [**2165-5-30**]. Dermatology was first consulted on [**2165-5-20**] for
continued itching because of what was thought to be Levaquin
and patient was pretreated with Benadryl. Patient was
awaiting bed to rehabilitation from [**2165-5-22**] onwards.
Patient continued to tolerate dialysis well with no further
issues and was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2165-5-30**]
after PICC line was placed.
