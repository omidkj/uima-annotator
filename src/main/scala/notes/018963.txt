Carotid duplex ultrasound: [**2131-12-11**]
Right ICA no stenosis. Left ICA no stenosis.

[**2131-12-12**] ECHO
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 40 cm from the incisors. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is bileaflet restriction
with a central MR jet.The left borders of the left atrium are
not well visulalized to be measured
Post bypass
The patient in now s/p Mitral annulopasty with a 28 ring
The patient is on a Milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min,Nor epi
@.05 mcg/kg/min, Epi at 0.1 mcg/kg/min.
The cardiac index is 1.9
There is mild residual mitral regurgitation
The aorta is similar to prebypass
The mean gradient across the mitral valve is 4 mm hg
EF on inotropy is 40-45%,with slight improvement in RV function.


[**2131-12-11**] Vein Mapping
Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate wide patency of the greater
saphenous veins bilaterally. Please see digitized images on PACS
for formal sequential measurements. Of note is a somewhat
varicoid appearance to the right greater saphenous vein
containing many large side branches.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22364**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-12-11**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. As he had been off his
coumadin for five days, heparin was started as a bridge to
surgery. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. Vein
mapping revealed varicosed veins bilaterally right more so then
left. A carotid duplex ultrasound showed no significant carotid
artery disease. The eectrophysiology service interogated his
pacemaker and made the appropriate changes in anticipation of
surgery. On [**2131-12-12**], [**Known lastname 22364**] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent a mitral valve repair using a 28mm
annuloplasty band. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He remained intubated given his need for pressors
and his hemodynamic instability. His pacer was again
interoggated and switched back to a DDD at 80. On postoperative
day two, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He
was slowly weaned off pressors and inotropes, were completing
off on post operative day seven.  He had been started on low
dose ace inhibitor prior to milirone being stopped and placed on
carvedilol. He continued to do well and physical therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility.  He was ready for discharge
to rehab ([**Hospital1 10478**] hills)on post operative day twelve.
