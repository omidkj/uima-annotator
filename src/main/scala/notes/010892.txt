Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-9-27**] - Coronary bypass grafting x4 with left internal mammary
   artery to left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the first obtuse
marginal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft
from the aorta to the second obtuse marginal coronary artery; as

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4295**] is a 83 year old male with a 2 month history of
dyspnea on exertion. He was referred for cardiac catheterization
after echo showed depressed LV function with an ejection
fraction of 20-25%. Echocardiogram also notable for [**1-18**]+ mitral
regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Subsequent cardiac catheterization was
significant for left main and three vessel disease. He is now
admitted for surgical revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2199-9-27**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A patent foramen ovale is present.Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction in mid to apical segments and
especially in the RCA territory. There is moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2199-10-2**] Discharge Chest X-ray, PA and Lat:
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable since
preoperative study and small right pleural effusion has been
present throughout. There is no pulmonary edema. Extremely heavy
asbestos-related pleural calcification obscures large areas of
the lung. Mediastinum has a stable and unremarkable
postoperative appearance. Atherosclerotic calcification in the
aorta and innominate artery is very heavy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4295**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-9-27**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to four vessels as well as resection of his left atrial
appendage. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit. On postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He developed atrial fibrillation as
well as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia which was treated
with Amiodarone. Given his low ejection fraction and ventricular
ectopy, the electrophysiology service was consulted. It was
initially decided that if his ejection fraction remained below
40% 2 months after surgery by echoacrdiogram, then a primary
prevention AICD would be placed. Given his poor ejection
fraction, Warfarin anticoagulation was initiated with a goal INR
between 1.5 - 2.5. On postoperative day three, he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Despite his poor ejection
fraction he was unable to be started on an ACE-I due to a
systolic blood pressure in the 90s. Prior to discharge, EP study
was performed and negative for inducible sustained ventricular
arrhythmias. Therefore AICD was not recommended at this time
with recommendations to advance beta blockade as tolerated. By
post-operative day six, he was medically cleared for discharge
to home. Prior to discharge, arrangements were made and
confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12872**] for outpatient management of
Warfarin.
