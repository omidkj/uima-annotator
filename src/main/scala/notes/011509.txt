Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo woman with COPD and 3L O2 requirement, transferred from
nursing home with desaturation to 52%/2L associated with
confusion.

1. Respiratory distress - LLL pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
Pt's saturation responded to BIPAP, solumedrol, nebs to 100% on
3LNC in ED, her baseline.  Respiratory acidosis improved.  Pt
started on Levo 250mg qd (renally dosed) for LLL pneumonia for
10 days total.  Prednisone 60mg qd x 2 weeks total, careful to
tightly control blood sugars.  Albuterol/atrovent nebs scheduled
with albuterol inh for rescue breathing.  Pt is a mouth
breather, so nasal canula was switched to face mask with good O2
sats (>95%).

2. UTI - by U/A, though UCx after Abx neg.  Covered with Levo.

3. h/o CHF - No old records.  No signs of active CHF now.  No
EKG evidence of old ischemia; CK and trop negative x 1.  Dig
level 0.6, which is okay.

4. Delerium - likely due to UTI and hypercarbia.  Improved after
BIPAP.
