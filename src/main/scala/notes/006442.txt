B LE strength 5/5, sensation +
trachea midline, c-collar in place
RRR, B CTA, no abrasion
Abd soft, NT/ND
B LE WWP, no edema

Pertinent Results:
CT c-spine [**9-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or malalignment.
2. Spondylosis with severe central canal stenosis at C3/4 and
C5/6. In the setting of trauma and multiple extremity paresis,
this is concerning for spinal cord contusion. Further evaluation
may be performed by MRI.
3. Thyroid nodule.

MRI [**9-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Severe spinal cord stenosis and cord compression at C3/C4 and
C5/C6. Increased signal within the cord at C3/C4 is concerning
for possible edema versus gliosis.
2) Abnormal signal intensity in the upper anterior portion of
the T2 vertebral body could represent a neoplastic metastatic
lesion. Consider clinical correlation and bone scan.

Brief Hospital Course:
After admission to the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 26581**] was evaluated by the
spine orthopedic attending. His c-spine CT scan showed severe
narrowing of his spinal canal. He was diagnosed with central
cord syndrome. Cord contusion was confirmed by MRI c-spine.
There was no fracture of the c-spine and no other injuries
besides minor abrasions. He was maintained on a solumedrol drip
for 48hrs without improvement of his upper extremity weakness.
His chest xray showed a small infiltrate with low grade temps
and he was started on levaquin for presumed pneumonia. All his
cultures were negative.
On [**9-23**], he was taken to the operating room for decompression of
his spinal canal. He tolearted the procedure well, however was
left intubated for airway protection. On [**9-27**], he underwent open
tracheostomy and open GJ-tube. After the procedure he was placed
on trach mask, which he tolerated well. He was placed in the
chair and seen by physical therapy. His c-collar should be in
place when not in bed.
At transfer, he was in a good condition. Tube feedings had been

pain controlled by prn pain meds. His incisions were clean, dry
and intact without erythema. He will finish his 10day course of
