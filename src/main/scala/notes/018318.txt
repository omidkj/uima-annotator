Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine / Bactrim / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
89 F with history of breast cancer s/p lumpectomy in [**2145**],
dementia, atrial fibrillation, PSVT, orthostatic hypotension and
history of syncopal episodes and multiple falls with recent C2/3
spinous process
fractures in [**10-5**], who presents after a syncopal episode with
C2 spinous process fracture on CT.  Patient was in USOH at rehab
(where she has had several falls), when to the bathroom to
urinate, became dizzy, syncopized and "hit the floor" quickly.
She landed on her left side, and is not sure whether she
actually lost consciousness. (event not witnessed). She cannot
recall any prodromal symptoms other than dizziness.  She was
brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where she was found to be hypoxic to 87%
on RA, Head CT neg, CXR showed fluffy bilateral infiltrates read
as pulmonary edema, shoulder and pelvic XRay without fracture,
and CT neck showed "subacute C2 fracture."  She received
Ceftriaxone and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further management.

.
The patient has had prior admissions for syncope, which is
thought to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension.  She has had
a 24 hour holter monitor during a symptomatic episode, which
showed sinus bradycardia in the 50s.  She is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of gerontology for her othostatic hypotension, who
recently increased her florinef to 0.1 mg daily in [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2149**].

MICRO:
[**2150-12-31**] URINE CULTURE - NO GROWTH

IMAGING:
-EKG [**2150-12-30**]: Sinus rhythm. Findings are within normal limits.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2150-10-4**] there is no
significant diagnostic change.
-CXR [**2150-12-30**]: Diffuse bilateral opacities may represent
pulmonary edema or ARDS, although infectious process not
excluded.
-C-SPINE (AP, FLEX & EXT): No significant interval change.
Unchanged, grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 which normalizes
with extension. Unchanged severe degenerative changes.
-CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: 1. No evidence of
pulmonary embolus. 2. Diffuse bilateral ground glass and
interstitial pulmonary opacities.  Differential includes ARDS or
pulmonary edema. Superimposed infectious process not excluded.
Recommend chest radiograph after diuresis for further
evaluation.
3. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
4. Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be reactive.
-ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60-70%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**11-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-9-5**], the apparent
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is markedly increased.
CXR [**2150-12-31**]: AP chest compared to [**12-30**] and baseline
examination [**5-15**]: Symmetrically distributed coarse
peribronchial opacification is probably pulmonary edema
worsening in some areas of the lungs, relatively sparing others
because of emphysema and relatively mild pulmonary fibrosis.
Moderate cardiomegaly with particularly severe left atrial
enlargement is longstanding. Pleural effusion is small if any.
An alternative to atypical pulmonary edema would be multifocal
interstitial pneumonia and particularly viral.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission to the medicine team, she was afebrile, but had a
chest xray concerning for multilobular pneumonia, and possibly
also for changes consistent with pulmomnary fibrosis from
Amiodarone, which she had been taking since [**2144**] for A Fib. She
was started on antibiotics (Cefepime, Cipro and Vancomycin for
HAP), and methylprednisolone 80mg q8h for treatment of
amiodarone toxicity, as well as albuterol and ipratropium
nebulizers for symptomatic treatment. Over a period of four days
her oxygen requirement improved from 6 liters to 3 liters and
she seemed to be markedly improving.
.
On [**1-4**], the patient became tachypneic, began grasping at her
throat, and was unresponsive to commands. A code blue was
called. Upon the ICU team's arrival to the patient she was being
intubated. She continued to have a pulse, but was bradycardic to
low 30s, with BP 60/palp. Pulse became weak. She was given
Atropine 0.5mg x2, and started on a Dopamine gtt. About 1 minute
into the drip, HR was >100 and SBP rose to 210. Doapmine was
stopped and she was transfered to the MICU, placed on the
ventilator and sedated on Versed and Fentanyl. Her post-arrest
lactate was 7.2, but by midnight it was 1.7.

On [**1-5**] she was bronchoscoped, and her steroids were continued
for presumed Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. She could not be
immediately weaned from the vent, and in fact on [**1-6**] required
an increase in FiO2 from 50% to 60% and PEEP of 8. Of note, she
had a BNP of 9540. On [**1-7**], tube feeds were started, and a CT of
her chest was interpreted as an acute CHF exacerbation
superimposed on chronic Amiodarone lung toxicity processes.
Weaning from the vent remained [**Name (NI) 2480**], and discussions were
held with the patient's son and family meetings arranged. On
[**1-9**], she was still intubated, and her Cef
