correlate with physical exam.

Indication:elevated LFT's, leukocytosis, diffuse abd pain, foul
stool
IMPRESSION:
1. Distended gallbladder with pericholecystic inflammatory
stranding and perihepatic free fluid are suggestive of
cholecystitis. Please refer to right upper quadrant ultrasound
performed the same day for further details.
2. Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, but
infection cannot be excluded.
3. 3.4 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.
4. Innumerable renal cysts with atrophied kidneys.

[**2186-9-19**] 5:44 PM ~CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: eval free air, acute process
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Please correlate with
subsequently performed CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis as well as
right upper quadrant ultrasound.
2. Left lung base increased opacity, possibly on the basis of
left lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia.
3. Right basilar atelectasis.

Reason: cholecystitis

PROCEDURE: After explaining potential risks and benefits of the
procedure to the patient's wife by telephone, verbal consent was
obtained. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2026**] served as witness. Patient identity
was confirmed by name and date of birth. A qualified nurse was
present to administer 50 mg of fentanyl over a 30-minute period
with appropriate monitoring.
The right upper abdomen was prepared and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine buffered with bicarbonate was
injected into the skin and subcutaneous tissues for local
anesthesia. Thereafter, utilizing ultrasound guidance, an
8-French pigtail catheter was inserted directly into the
gallbladder. There was a free return of bile. The gallbladder
was decompressed with suction (approximately 300 cc.) and
specimens were sent for culture and Gram stain. The catheter was
then connected to the bag to drain dependently. The patient
tolerated the procedure and no immediate complications were
observed. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was present for all essential portions of the
procedure.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patient status post percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
placement by ultrasound guidance.
.
[**2186-9-20**] 3:30 AM ~CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
IMPRESSION:
1. Right internal jugular line without evidence of pneumothorax.
The orientation of the distal tip suggests possible placement
within the ostium of the azygos vein.
2. Small left pleural effusion.
3. Left lower lobe collapse.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
HD1: Presented to ER, Pt admitted to SICU for observation and
percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage. Overnight patient
recieved 2 units of FFP, remained afebrile and hemodynamically
stable with a decreasing white count.

HD2: Perc chole drain placed without incident, creatinine
improving from 2.1->1.5, ICU course notable for improved mental
status; patient advanced to clears without incident.  patient's
mental status much improved and ready to transfer to floor.
Patient's family had visited for support without incident.

HD3-6: Patient did well on the floor. mental status improved to
that of baseline - was repsonding appropriately and able to
thave conversations. he was tolerating a regular diet and had
worked some with physical therapy - sitting in a chair, etc...
Patient did have one episode of increased respirations which
after appropriate workup and treatment was determined to be
fluid overload and responded well to lasix. he was ready to be
discharged on HD4 but there were no beds, so patient remained in
house until HD6 at which he was discharged back to his facility
with his perc chole drain with instructions to f/u in about 3
weeks with dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in clinic.
