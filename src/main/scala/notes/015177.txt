[**2169-9-19**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Despite interval drainage with a
pigtail catheter (since removed), there is no significant change
of the pelvic abscess compared to [**2169-6-23**].
2. Unchanged sigmoid colon diverticulosis and thickening of the
sigmoid colon bowel wall without evidence of acute
diverticulitis.

[**2169-9-21**] CT guided drainage :
Technically successful CT-guided drainage of diverticular
abscess

[**2169-9-25**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Pigtail catheter is seen
appropriately placed curling within the pelvic abscess however
the pelvic abscess is unchanged in size. The case was discussed
with the surgical resident caring for the patient, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] suggested that the drain should be attached to
negative suggestion to facilitate appropriate evacuation of the
abscess.

[**2169-9-26**] TTE :
no obvious vegetations seen, but technically suboptimal study

[**2169-9-29**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Interval increase in amount of ascitic fluid within the
abdomen and
pelvis, with suggestion of abscess rupture inferiorly with
increased size to abscess. Barium within the cavity consistent
with known fistulization to the adjacent sigmoid colon which
remains thick walled. Drain remains positioned within anterior
aspect of collection.
2. Interval development of small bilateral simple pleural
effusions as well as some adjacent compression atelectasis.
3. Unchanged hepatomegaly with underlying fatty infiltration.

[**2169-10-6**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Status post sigmoidectomy and ileostomy.
2. Persisting suprapubic fluid collection and pigtail catheter
removal.
3. Moderate-to-large amount of ascites with enhancing
peritoneum, concerning for peritonitis.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
5. Cirrhosis

[**2169-10-11**] CT Abd/pelvis : Recently placed pigtail catheter is at
least partially within the bladder dome with the overlying
suprapubic simple fluid collection has been decreased in size
from most recent imaging.
These findings were discussed in detail with the caring surgical
resident, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], via phone immediately after exam completion
at 6:20 p.m. A joint
decision between the radiology and surgical team was to remove
the catheter and continue bladder foley decompression for one to
two weeks to allow further healing of the inflamed bladder dome.
The catheter was removed uneventfully by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12919**] shortly
after exam completion. Can consider cystogram prior to foley
removal to ensure no leak.

[**2169-10-23**] Cystogram : No evidence of bladder leak in this normal
cystogram.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2169-9-19**], the patient was admitted to general surgery for
persistent diverticulitis and pelvic abscess.  Hepatology was
consulted for elevated LFTs suspicious for infectious vs.
alcoholic aetiology.  She was started on levofloxacin and
metronidazole.  She was rendered NPO, and on [**2169-9-21**], she
underwent CT-guided drain placement of the pelvic abscess.
Drained fluid was sent for culture.  Her pain was improved and
she was started on regular diet with nutritional
supplementation, which she tolerated.  Nutrition consult was
obtained for poor nutriti
