ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. Bile peritonitis.
2. Small bowel obstruction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 72-year-old
male, who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital from
[**2-21**] to [**2142-4-6**] for acute mesenteric ischemia
for which he had status post aortobifemoral bypass graft for
an occluded mesenteric vasculature with dead bowel.  He also
underwent a massive small bowel resection with
jejunocolostomy during that hospital visit.  This was
followed with ileocecectomy and ileocolostomy, and a
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, a PEG/J tube and a left
subclavian Hickman for long-term TPN.

His previous hospital course was complicated by anastomotic
ulcer with significant bleeding.  The bleeding had
subsequently subsided over a period of time.  The patient was
then discharged to rehab after prolonged hospital course, but
now returns with significant dehydration, azotemia, sepsis,
abdominal pain, and a low-grade temperature of 100.3.  He
also had leukocytosis, and on initial CT scan, there was
presumed small bowel obstruction at the small bowel - colon
anastomosis.  Patient was brought in urgently for hydration
and exploratory laparotomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Acute mesenteric ischemia.
2. Anastomotic ulcer/bleed.
3. History of MRSA.
4. History of Enterobacter/Klebsiella septicemia.
5. Significant 60-pack year smoking history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Aortobifemoral/superior mesenteric artery bypass graft.
2. Small bowel resection.
3. Left subclavian double lumen Hickman.
4. Status post ileocecectomy/ileocolostomy.
5. Status post cholecystostomy tube.
6. Status post PEG-J tube.
7. Remote status post vasectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Levaquin 500 mg q.d.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
3. Ursodiol 300 mg t.i.d.
4. Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.
5. Loperamide 2 mg b.i.d.

10. Insulin-sliding scale.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  WBC 21.4, hematocrit 29.9,
platelets 247.  Sodium 154, potassium 3.8, chloride 125,
bicarb 16, BUN 74, creatinine 1.8, glucose 72.  ALT 96, AST
92, alkaline phosphatase 318.  Amylase 23, total bilirubin
9.9, lipase 11.

CT of the abdomen and CT angiogram:  Small bowel obstruction
with distention of the small bowel, edema of the small bowel
wall, most likely at the ileocolonic anastomotic site.
Distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall edema.  Ascites.
Patent superior mesenteric artery graft.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted on [**2142-5-11**] and
immediately went to the operating room for an exploratory
laparotomy.  In the OR, a exploratory laparotomy with a
midline incision was performed, along with a cholecystectomy,
and G tube placement.  A small bowel resection with
jejunocolostomy was also performed, and a diagnosis of bile
peritonitis was confirmed in the OR.  The patient tolerated
the procedure, remained in hypovolemic/septic shock following
the operation.  He was transferred to the Surgical ICU for
further management of his hypovolemia, azotemia, and sepsis.
He was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics including
vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl, and fluconazole.

During his OR and initial ICU course, he received 8 units of
packed red blood cells, 4 units of FFP, and over 5 liters of
crystalloid.  He had an estimated blood loss of 2 liters in
the OR.  He was maintained on a Levophed drip.  Over the next
couple of days, the patient was given massive fluid
resuscitation along with FFP and vitamin K.  He was kept
intubated and sedated.

During his hospitalization, the Vascular Surgery service was
also made aware of his presence.  They had formally evaluated
while in the Emergency Department, and followed him
throughout his hospital course.  They felt that he
demonstrated no evidence of acute ischemia during his present
hospital course.  This patient had blood cultures, sputum
cultures, and peritoneal cultures all which demonstrates
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

By [**4-15**], the patient was finally weaned off his
Levophed.  He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
rest of his ICU course.  He was continued on broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  Patient was also started on TPN with the help
of a nutritional consult.  He was also started on tube feeds
and advanced slowly to a goal of 30 cc an hour of full
strength Impact with fiber.

On [**4-16**], the patient was started on diuresis of his
fluid overload.  On [**4-17**], a right upper extremity
ultrasound was obtained for right upper extremity swelling.
This ultrasound demonstrated a nonocclusive thrombus of the
right internal jugular vein.  The patient was started on a
Heparin drip of 400 units per hour with a goal of 40-60 PTT.

On [**4-19**], the patient developed diarrhea, Clostridium
difficile was sent, which returned negative.  On [**4-20**],
the patient was finally extubated and patient was tolerating
goal tube feeds and CPM.  He was transferred to the VICU on
[**2142-4-21**].  He received aggressive chest PT.  He was
finally transferred to floor status on [**2142-4-23**], and
also underwent a second ultrasound, which did not reveal any
deep venous thrombus particularly of the right internal
jugular vein.  His Heparin was stopped, and the patient was
also taken off all antibiotics by [**2142-4-23**].

A bedside swallow study was performed, and the patient was
determined to be a clear aspiration risk.  As a result, he
was maintained at NPO status, and was continued on tube feeds
with a plan for long-term TPN.  Home TPN service and Dr.[**Name (NI) 19165**] office was contact[**Name (NI) **] for future planning of home TPN.
Patient's Foley was also discontinued, and he successfully
passed his voiding trial.  Physical Therapy and Occupational
Therapy were both consulted, and patient was screened for
rehab.  Patient remained hemodynamically stable, and remained
afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital course.  He was
set for discharge by [**2142-4-24**].
