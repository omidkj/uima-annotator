Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck pain and L arm weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lung biopsy [**2101-7-8**]
C-spine stabilization [**2101-7-11**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 60013**] is an 80yo RHM with a history of atrial
fibrillation, HTN, HLD and elevated PSAs on finasteride therapy
who is being admitted for the work up of a C-spine bony mass
with
associated cord compression. He reports that he has been
experiencing neck pain, weakness, unsteadiness. He describes
stiffness located on the right side of his neck that radiates to
his shoulder.  It also radiates up to the back of the head,
consistent with occipital headaches.  He did do a course of
physical therapy for what was thought to be muscle spasms, but
it
was not at all helpful. Two after developing neck pain patient
started have weakness on the left upper extremity. He also
complains of some clumsiness with his left hand more so than his
right.  He says that his left hand is "useless" he reports
dropping things and a general lack of coordination.  He also
reports having lost [**10-8**] pounds. Today he denies any
incontinence.

He also describes a generalized unsteadiness that has caused him
to be much less active on his feet. "When I stand, I fall back",
and is very concerning to him.

He had MRI/ cervical spine at Health Alliance MRI/center on
[**2101-6-18**] which showed a large mass is best appreciated on the T1
and T2 Weighted sequence and appears to arise from the posterior
elements of  C2. [**2101-6-22**]  CT/Head at Health Alliance MRI center
that showed a hypodensity within the brainstem. We do not have
an
official report.

Review of Systems: Negative for dysarthria, dysphagia, increased
phlegm production without increased shortness of breath or
fevers/chills, no diarrhea/constipation, no bowel/bladder
incontinence, no double vision.


Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin therapy, noted to have an
elevated INR of 7.5 yesterday. He reports at least two prior
admissions for epistaxis requiring holding of his warfarin. He
is
normally followed at the [**Hospital **] hospital.

3. HLD
4. CAD: told that he had an EKG which showed evidence of old
infarct

they are watching and waiting, and since his last test, the PSA
has not elevated.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2101-7-12**]):    NO GROWTH.

REPORTS:
CXR [**2101-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Large size central pulmonary
right-sided hilar mass. No previous chest examinations available
for comparison. Described findings would benefit from a chest CT
for further delineation of the process.

CT ABD/PELVIS/CHEST [**2101-7-6**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Lung mass measuring 3.1 x 6.0 x 6.8 cm proximal to the right
hilum with a single adjacent enlarged hilar lymph node
concerning for primary malignancy.
2. 10 mm hypodense/hypoenhancing focus Segment VIII in the right
liver lobe is not completely characterized on this exam.
Small/early metastasis can not be excluded.
3. 7 mm arterial hyperenhancing nodule in the body of the
pancreas.
Differential includes a primary pancreatic tumor (such as a
neuroendocrine
tumor) or metastasis.
4. 8 mm soft tissue nodule in the mesentery in the left upper
quadrant
concerning for metastasis.

MRI L-SPINE [**2101-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous signal intensity
mass involving the lateral mass of C2 vertebra, likely a bony
metastasis. Visual
