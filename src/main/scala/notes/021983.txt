Labs on Discharge:

Imaging/Other Data on Discharge
[**5-26**] Sputum cx:  GRAM STAIN (Final [**2161-5-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S).
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2161-5-29**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
      YEAST.    SPARSE GROWTH.
      HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE, BETA-LACTAMASE NEGATIVE.
MODERATE GROWTH.
         Beta-lactamse negative: presumptively sensitive to
ampicillin.
         Confirmation should be requested in cases of treatment
failure in
         life-threatening infections..

[**5-26**] Urine legionella Ag: Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final
[**2161-5-27**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

[**5-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Right lung opacities with possible small
left lower lung opacity,
raising concern for multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting.
In the setting of trauma, pulmonary hemorrhage/contusion or
aspiration not
excluded.

[**5-26**] C-spine CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture with minimal retrolisthesis of C3 on C4
which is most
likely degenerative in etiology, although of indeterminate ge.
2. Multilevel degenerative change with posterior disc osteophyte
complex at
C5-C6 causing mild-to-moderate spinal canal narrowing. If
clinical concern
exists for cervical cord injury, consider MRI if no
contraindication.
3. Partially imaged right lung consolidation may be due to
infection and
extent better assessed on accompanying chest radiograph.

[**5-26**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

[**5-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Right PICC ends in the region of the cavoatrial junction.
2. Improved, but persistent multifocal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 46742**] is an 87 year old man with a PMHx significant for
idiopathic capillary leak syndrome, moderate AS, and recent
pneumonia with RML abscess who presented to the ED s/p a fall
and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with PNA and hypoxemia. His stay
was complicated by acute kidney injury which resolved over
course of admission

# Pneumonia and hypoxemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 46742**] presented to the ED on
[**5-26**] following a fall from standing. In the ED, he was found to
have right sided pulmonary infiltrates, productive cough, and
hypoxemia. In the unit, Mr. [**Known lastname 46742**] was found to be normoxic
with SpO2 of 93-96% on room air suggesting that perhaps a mucous
plug had been expectorated. He was begun on Vanc, zosyn, and
levofloxacin in the ED and this was continued on the floor. CXR
performed on admission demonstrated a multifocal pneumonia.
Sputum cx grew H. influenzae and was trated with empiric
Vancomycin and Zosyn which was changed for oral Amoxicillin on
[**2161-6-2**].

#Acute kidney injury: Mr. [**Known lastname 95339**] initial BUN/Cr in the ED
was 31/1.1. With his baseline creatine of 0.7, cachectic body
habitus, and physical exam consistent with volume depletion,
this was thought to represent prerenal azotemia. Fluid repletion
with NS was performed with improvement in renal function.

#Aspiration: Given recurrent pneumonias including abscess it was
felt pneumonias were likely to be related to aspiration. Pt also
noted to sound gurgly when lying flat and talking. Speech and
swallow eval was requested. Patient was placed on dysphagia diet
with thinned liquids which has been noted in the discharge
orders. However, speech pathologist evaluation on [**2161-6-2**] did not
show any evidnce of dysphagia or aspiration, so he was changed
to a regular diet.

#Lung nodule: Patient was found to have persistent GGOs on chest
CT performed in mid [**Month (only) **] compared to CT in [**Month (only) 547**]. Therefore, it
was recommended that patient have a follow up CT in 6 months
([**2161-10-29**]). Previous CTs were performed at [**Hospital1 2025**].
