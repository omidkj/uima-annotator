Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS: T 98.0 BP 157/69 HR 128 RR 31 O2sat 94% 6L
GENERAL:  Alert, oriented, cooperative male in no mild
respiratory distress.
HEENT:  Scleara anicteric.  Right pupil asymmetric but reactive,
left pupil symmetric and reactive.  Mucous membranes are moist,
oropharynx clear.
NECK:  Supple, no masses, no cervical or supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregularly irregular, normal S1, S2, no rubs,
murmurs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Moderate air flow, expiratory wheezes throughout,
increased expiratory phase, bronchial breath sounds left lung,
decreased breath sounds at bases bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel
sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.  Well healed right leg mass with no
residual deficits at this time.
NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR [**2196-9-3**]:
1.  Interval increase in size of multiple pulmonary metastases.
2.  Interval increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CTA CHEST [**2196-9-3**]: no pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Calcifications are noted within the coronary arteries.  There is
no
pericardial effusion, though fluid extends superiorly within the
pericardial recess.  A prominent left supraclavicular lymph node
mass, not present on the prior exam, measures 2.7 x 3.3 cm.
Mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged. Lung windows
demonstrate marked progression of metastatic disease.  Existing
lesions have increased dramatically in size, and there are
multiple new nodules.  For example, previous dominant nodule
along the left pleural margin now measures 5.1 cm, previously
2.5 cm. Nodule at the right cardiophrenic recess measures 4.4
cm, previously 1.8 cm. Nodule at the esophageal hiatus has grown
markedly extending inferiorly and displacing the aorta to the
left, measuring approximately 7.9 cm, previously 2.4 cm.  Many
lesions have become confluent, particularly at the right lung
base. The patient is status post left upper lobectomy with
volume loss in the left lung.  Intramural peripheral thrombus in
the thoracic aorta without aneurysm is unchanged. There is no
evidence of osseous metastasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year-old man with history of metastatic lung cancer, 100
pack-year smoking history, presented with acute on chronic
dyspnea.
.
# Respiratory distress: Diffuse wheezes on exam. CXR revealed
innumerable pulmonary masses, perihilar opacities, pleural
effusions. CTA showed no PE. Dyspnea was likely due to a
combination of infection, cancer progression, COPD exacerbation.
He received solumedrol IV and prednisone taper, fluticasone,
ipratropium, Xopenex, diuretics, and levofloxacin. His symptoms
improved to dyspnea only with movements. He was still on 2L NC
of O2 on discharge. He was sent home with prenisone taper, nebs,
and levofloxacin x 8 more days.
.
# Chest pain: Patient had episodes of chest pain. MI was ruled
out. Pain resolved by discharge.
.
# Abdominal pain: chronic stomach spasm. He was put on diazepam.
No pain at time of discharge.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Patient unaware in AF; last
documented in [**3-28**].  CHAD2 score 1 for age. He was continued on
metoprolol for rate control and was started on ASA 325 mg for
anticoagulation, with warfarin to be considered as outpatient.
He was put on Xopenex instead of albuterol.
.
# Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No recent
chemotherapy.  No signs or symptoms of bleeding.
.
# Chronic kidney disease: Unclear etiology.  Creatinine at
baseline.
.
# Metastatic lung cancer: Rapidly progressive on imaging. He was
continued on  amitriptyline, tylenol for pain. Home with hospice
care.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
