Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo F transferred here on [**4-19**] intubated from OSH for possible
tracheal stent placement given tracheal compression [**2-9**] to large
left sided small cell lung tumor, metastatic to liver.  Had
received chemotherapy at the OSH on [**4-21**] (carboplatin and
etoposide).

She was admitted initially to the ICU and underwent bronchoscopy
found to have 80% stenosis of RUL bronchus.  No intervention
undertaken.  SVC found to be completely occluded and stent was
placed with excellent effect.  Additionally, patient found to
have R subclavian thrombus.  She was initially treated with
heparin and transitioned to and discharged on lovenox. Echo on
[**4-21**] revealed severely depressed EF of 20% presumed to be from
myocarditis - viral vs. chemotherapy induced.  Repeat echo one
week on [**4-28**] showed slight improvement to 20-25%.  She was
treated with ACEi and BB for non-decompensated heart failure.
Patient also underwent 160cc thoracentsis of R pleural effusion
and received empiric treatment for pneumonia which was completed
prior to transfer to floor. She was successfully extubated and
transferred to the floor.

On the floor patient became pancytopenic as expected 10 days
post-chemotherapy administration.  Her respiratory status
improved and she was successfully weaned off of oxygen though
she remained short of breath (though not hypoxic) with
ambulation more than 10 yards.  She was monitored for several
days to ensure increase in counts which started to trend back up
towards normal and she was discharged in stable condition on
room air home with services on lovenox.  Per patient preference,
she will follow up with oncology at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted from an outside hospital where you had been
intubated as you were found to have a large tumor compressing
your airway and much of your left lung.  You were brought here
to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a stent placed in your superior vena cava (SVC)
as it had a large clot in it which was preventing blood flow out
of your head.  You initially were admitted here to the ICU but
were extubated
