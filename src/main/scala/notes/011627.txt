vascular resistance 814.  After 24 hours of Natricor, the
pulmonary artery pressure was 46/16 with a mean of 30 and the
patient was 1.3 liters negative.  He was tolerating diuresis
well at the time of his transfer to C Medicine Service.  The
patient was also having worsening of his chronic renal
failure recently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.8, blood pressure 97-120 systolic/51-70 diastolic with MAP
ranging from 63-84, pulse 70 beats per minute paced,
respirations 18.  General:  The patient was lying supine in
bed, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  No icterus.  No pallor.
Neurological:  No focal neurological deficits.  The patient
was alert and oriented times three.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm, III/VI holosystolic murmur best auscultated
at the apex, S3, jugular venous distention 10 cm, positive
bilateral pretibial pitting edema.  Pulmonary:  Lungs clear
to auscultation with crackles at the right lung base.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2190-2-6**], the white blood cell count was
4.2, hematocrit 25.4, platelets 160,000, BUN 79, creatinine
3.7, INR 1.8, creatinine decreased to 3.3 on [**2190-2-7**].

EKG showed a paced rhythm at 70 beats per minute.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please see the first paragraph of this
discharge summary.

After transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on the floor, the patient
continued to diurese well at 1.5 to 2 liters negative per
day.  His creatinine continued to fall.  His blood pressure
remained stable.  He remained asymptomatic.  The swelling in
his legs noticeably decreased.  The patient felt that his
breathing was easier.

A Renal consult was placed and they advised to continue
diuresis.  EP consult was also placed for consideration of
placement of a biventricular pacer but since the patient had
significant clinical improvement this was deferred.
