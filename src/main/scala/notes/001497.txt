HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88-year-old male
admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**] with complaints of loose bowel
movements, tea-colored urine, increasing lethargy, and
dehydration.  On presentation to the emergency room, the
patient was lethargic with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing, dry
mucous membranes, and a heart rate between 30 and 40.  The
patient was treated with one amp of D50, NEW, 5 units of
insulin, and one amp of calcium gluconate.  Lasix was given
for congestive heart failure and then he was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed
atrial fibrillation treated with Digoxin and on admission the
level was 2.3; history of gastrointestinal bleeding;
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the urine;
anemia; hypertension; status post large MCA stroke on
[**2154-4-30**] on the right leaving the patient with left-sided
neglect and left hemiparesis; and gastric polyps.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed
temperature 99 degrees, pulse 70, respiratory rate 26, oxygen
saturation 95% on room air, blood pressure 161/58.  In
general, the patient was only able to speak Russian.  He
appeared to be moving his right side only and had soft
restraints on the right wrist from pulling his lines.  HEENT
examination revealed pupils equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Sclerae were anicteric.  The chest revealed coarse
breath sounds transmitted diffusely with rales bibasilarly.
There were occasional wheezes noted over the right middle
lobe region.  Cardiovascular examination revealed normal S1
and S2, occasional premature beats, and no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdominal examination revealed T-tube in place.
The site appeared clean, dry, and intact.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel
sounds.  Genitourinary examination revealed Foley catheter
draining cloudy amber urine and leaking at the insertion
site.  The patient was guaiac negative.  The extremities
revealed no edema and no rash.  There was a small shallow
ulcer roughly 1 cm across over the left lateral malleolus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for management of acute renal failure
with creatinine going from 0.5 to 3.6 with minimal urine
output.  He was also begun on Ciprofloxacin and treated from
[**6-14**] to [**6-23**] for urinary tract infection.  He began
receiving hemodialysis while in the unit for his acute renal
failure and developed a right thigh hematoma from the
catheter insertion site for which he received two units of
blood transfusion and fluid resuscitation.  He was then
transferred to the medical floor on [**2154-6-16**].

His hospital course was significant for an increase in
creatinine to a maximum of 7.3.  The differential diagnoses
were thought to be acute tubular necrosis or acute
interstitial nephritis possibly with minimal chain disease.
The patient had significant proteinuria of 1.8 grams in 24
hours.  Potassium was initially managed well with Kayexalate.
On admission, it was 5.5 and came down appropriately.
Prednisone was begun at 60 mg q.d. on [**2154-6-22**] to treat
acute interstitial nephritis empirically.  No biopsy was
obtained.

The decision was made to initiate hemodialysis due to
worsening electrolyte abnormalities and volume overload.  On
[**2154-6-25**], the patient underwent Quinton catheter
placement.  A right femoral was attempted without good flow.
A left femoral line was successfully placed.  The patient
underwent hemodialysis with removal of 1.0 kilograms.  Later
in the evening, after hemodialysis, the patient's systolic
blood pressure dropped down below 70.  His hematocrit was
20.2 down from 27 earlier in the day.  A CT scan was obtained
of the abdomen and lower extremities which showed a right
hematoma.  No retroperitoneal bleed was noted.  The patient
was emergently transfused and volume resuscitated.  After
being transferred to the medical floor, the patient remained
stable except for a continued drop in his hematocrit such
that he received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells
over the course of [**6-25**] to [**6-29**].  In addition to this,
the patient's volume status responded well to hemodialysis as
a decrease was noted in his anasarca.  Also the patient was
noted to have yeast in his urine on [**6-22**] and on [**6-28**]
for which he was begun on Diflucan.  The patient had been
instrumented since being at the rehabilitation facility.

In terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation, he has been
rate controlled successfully on Lopressor; however within the
last week as he has undergone hemodialysis and has begun
approaching his dry weight, his blood pressure has begun to
decline associated with the start of hemodialysis before
volume was taken off.  His blood pressure was felt to be
volume sensitive and we are in the processing of titrating
his Lopressor down from 100 mg b.i.d. which was initially
used to control his atrial fibrillation to a dose that will
be better tolerated by his blood pressure.  In addition to
this, it is recommended that at hemodialysis, the temperature
of the diasylate be decreased to prevent induction of
hypotension.  The patient's blood pressure remained stable
while he was on the floor in the range of 120/70 with a pulse
in the 80s.  His stay over the last two weeks of admission
has been mostly uneventful except for an acute mental status
change that appeared due to a urinary tract infection with
subsequent urosepsis.  That was diagnosed on [**2154-7-18**] when the
patient was noted to be producing turbid urine in his Foley.
Urinalysis sent off showed a high epithelial cell count and
cultures of the Foley specimen of urine grew out both yeast
and Staphylococcus aureus.  There was no evidence of an
endovascular infection.  Repeat urinalysis and urine culture
grew out only yeast at 106 colony forming units per
milliliter and no Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was
begun on Ciprofloxacin and Diflucan.  Ciprofloxacin was given
at 500 mg p.o. q.d., to be dosed after hemodialysis on
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and the Diflucan at 100
mg p.o. q.d.  Both of these are anticipated to continue for a
14 day course in him and they were started on [**2154-7-19**].
During the course of his stay on the medical floor, he has
remained afebrile and other than the acute mental status
change, he has remained otherwise stable.  His baseline
mental status appears to be conversant in Russian with
slurred speech that may be secondary to lack of dentures.
