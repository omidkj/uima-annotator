Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
CODE STROKE;


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV TPA

History of Present Illness:
This is a 88 yo RH man who was in good health this AM, made his
breakfast, was eating pancakes and sausage when at 10:50am his
wife heard a thud in the dining room and found him on the floor,
awake and eyes open but not answering questions. He was taken to
an OSH ([**Hospital1 1474**]) where he was noted to have a right
hemiparesis and aphasia, NIHSS of 22 by their count, CT neg for
bleed but with some signs of left frontal infarct. No tPA was
given as per notes he had a "recent MI."  This MI actually
occured in [**2165**] per family. Regardless, he was transferred here
for further stroke w/u after being given 325mg asa pr. On our
exam he had an NIHSS of 16 (see exam below), bottom line had a
global aphasia and right hemiparesis. CTA showed a left M1
signal drop out. Code stroke was paged at 2:51pm. He got the CTA
just minutes later and was seen by neuro immediately. Despite
being out of the 3 hour window for t-PA, he got t-PA at 3:40pm
(5.8mg bolus followed by 52.3 mg infusion) with good result - he
was more awake, raising his right arm to gravity and admitted to
ICU.

Family notes on ROS he was seen by PCP last week for "virus" as
he was feeling woozy, decreased PO intake. Otherwise had no c/o
SOB, CP, palp.

Found to be in new afib in the ED.

CT AT PRESENTATION:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of the normally midline
structures. There is loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter differentiation
at the left insula and portions of the left frontal/parietal
lobes. Additionally, there is mild sulcal effacement. The
findings are concerning for acute infarct in the left middle
cerebral artery territory. There is no hydrocephalus. The
osseous structures are unremarkable. There is a large left
maxillary sinus retention cyst.
IMPRESSION:
1) Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the left middle
cerebral artery territory concerning for acute infarction.
CTA NECK & CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: There is multifocal narrowing of
the vertebrobasilar and carotid vessels. At the left internal
carotid artery, at the carotid bifurcation, moderate
atherosclerotic disease and calcified plaques result in a 60%
stenosis. Atherosclerosis in the distal basilar artery results
in moderately-severe narrowing. Within the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], a
filling defect is seen in the left M2 branch of the middle
cerebral artery which may be consistent with thrombus or
embolus. Additionally, there is depletion of the normal
branching pattern of the left middle cerebral artery, distal to
the obstruction, consistent with hypoperfusion and/or distal
embolization.
IMPRESSION:
Multifocal stenoses of the vertebrobasilar and carotid arteries,
particularly in the left internal carotid artery just distal to
the common carotid bifurcation. Additionally, a filling defect
in the left middle cerebral artery may represent a thrombus or
embolus at this location.

A preliminary report of stroke in the left middle cerebral
artery territory with filling defect was given by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
3:30 p.m.

CAROTID U/S [**2-24**]:
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid and
vertebral arteries. Significant plaque was identified on the
left. It is heterogeneous with some calcification.
On the right, peak systolic velocities are 97, 100, 147 in the
ICA, CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1. This is
consistent with less than 40% stenosis.
On the left, in the internal carotid artery, the peak systolic
over diastolic velocity is 250/33. In the remainder of the
vessel the peak systolic velocities are 90, 146 in the CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 2.8. This is consistent
with a 70-79% stenosis.
There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: Significant left-sided plaque with a 70-79% carotid
stenosis. On the right there is less than 40% stenosis.

MRI/A:
There is an area of restricted diffusion involving the left
anterior temporal and left frontal lobes extending to the left
subinsular region and the left posterior parietal lobe, all of
which are consistent with a large subacute left MCA distribution
infarct. There is involvement of the left insular ribbon by this
infarction with slight adjacent sulcal dilatation noted. No
evidence for hemorrhagic transformation is seen. There is
minimal enhancement seen within the infarct in the frontal
region following intravenous gadolinium administration. The
ventricular system is symmetrical without hydrocephalus.
Scattered T2 hyperintensities are noted along the centrum
semiovale suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic or
gliotic changes. There is chronic mucosal thickening within the
paranasal sinuses. Signal flow voids are preserved along the
intracranial portions of the carotid and basilar arteries.
IMPRESSION: Large area
