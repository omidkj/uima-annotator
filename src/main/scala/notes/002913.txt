Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, labored breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
endocardial biopsy


History of Present Illness:
35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive
lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed
systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission
[**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, re-admitted with
shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.

Her symptoms began in [**Month (only) **] (after a recent
hospitalization), when she developed diarrhea (which she relates
to her metoprolol). The diarrhea (multiple times daily,
non-bloody, brown in color) initially improved but then worsened
again. She then developed nausea, vomiting, and dry heaves,
without abdominal pain, and was admitted on [**10-10**]. She also
reported worsening shortness of breath, 3 pillow orthopnea, and
episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She was felt to be
intravascularly dry, so she was given IV fluids. She had a
thorough workup for causes of her diarrhea (infectious,
structural, medication related etc.) and was scheduled for GI
follow up on [**10-16**]. During the admission, an echocardiogram was
performed, demonstrating worsening systolic function (EF
15-20%), but she was felt to be intravascularly dry, so her
Lasix was held. Given the patient's concern that her diarrhea
started at the same time as metoprolol (75mg daily), this
medication was also stopped (and switched to carvedilol 3.125mg
[**Hospital1 **]). She was to have close follow up with her cardiologist. She
had acute on chronic renal failure which returned to close to
baseline (1.5) with IV fluids; she had a renal biopsy during
that admission, the results of which are still pending. Her
Imuran was initially held during the last hospitalization but
was restarted after a conversation with her [**Hospital1 112**] rheumatologist.
During that hospitalization, her nausea was not fully explained,
but there was a possibility that restarting her Imuran may have
contributed.

Her presentation today is similar. She has nausea and dry heaves
(non-bloody, non-bilious), along with worsening shortness of
breath/PND/orthopnea. Her husband (who follows her vitals
closely) has noted increased blood pressures and heart rates
since she was discharged from the hospital. Given her worsened
nausea and tachycardia to the 120's, he brought her to the
hospital. She denies any history of blood clot (but had IUFD at
21wks recently).

In the ED, triage vitals were T97.6F, HR 124, BP 126/109, RR 18,
Sat 100%. She was given 4mg IV ondansteron x 2, in addition to
ceftriaxone and azithromycin given an equivocal chest x-ray. She
was transferred to the floor for further evaluation. Her
respiratory rate was noted to be as high as 33.

On review of systems, she reports nausea and vomiting, as well
as shortness for breath and orthopnea as above. Diarrhea is
unchanged. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain (but perhaps
some chest "heaviness"), palpitations, pleuritic chest pain,
cough, weakness, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain,
constipation, hematemesis, hematochezia, urinary symptoms.

Past Medical History:
- SLE: diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease
(membranous nephropathy by report of biopsy), facial rash,
Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis
- Gastritis
- Restrictive lung disease: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], noted to
be moderate to severe on PFTs completed 5/[**2179**].
- History of pancytopenia associated with varicella zoster
infection
- History of persistent thrombocytopenia
- Baseline proteinuria (Cr 0.8-0.9 pre-pregnancy)
- Intrauterine fetal demise [**7-/2180**] (at gestational age ~21wks)
- Right- and left-sided cardiomyopathy (EF estimated 15-20% in
[**9-/2180**])


Social History:
Patient is a computer programer in [**Location (un) 745**] and married. She was
accompanied at presentation by her husband [**Name (NI) **] and sister. She
denies tobacco or EtOH.

CXR [**10-15**] PA/Lat (prelim): Retrocardiac opacification which may
represent atelectasis vs. pneumonia; bibasilar effusions and
increased hilar infiltrates suggestive of volume overload;
stable moderate cardiomegaly.

ECG [**10-15**]: Sinus tachycardia. Leftward axis, normal intervals.
TWF in I, II, V5-V6 (interpreted as pseudonormalization in ED,
but unimpressive).

[**Month/Year (2) **] [**10-11**]: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-7-24**], the
LV cavity size has increased and the LVEF is slightly lower
(LVEF OVERestimated on prior study). RV dysfunction is now more
prominent.
