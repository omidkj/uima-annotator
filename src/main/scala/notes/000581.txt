History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo female with PMH significant for OSA, obesity
hypoventilation, and pulmonary HTN who is being transferred to
the MICU for dyspnea requiring BiPAP. The patient presented to
her PCP earlier today with chest pain and SOB. In the ED, her
chest pain resolved quickly and the initial plan was to admit
her to the cardiology service for ROMI. Upon further questioning
the patient was more short of breath than she has been at
baseline. Per daughter, her SOB has gotten worse over the past 2
weeks especially on exertion. The patient has been also feeling
more fatigued. She also admits to some production of green
sputum. No associated PND, orthopnea, lower extremity swelling,
fevers, or chills. Of note, the patient has been admitted to the
MICU multiple times for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was
noted to become more somnolent and ABG showed an elevated PC02.
She was then placed on BiPAP and then transferred to the MICU.
Of note, the patient has missed several of her appointments with
her pulmonologist and endocrinologist.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.0 BP 120/56 AR 62 RR 14 O2
sat 94% on 2L NC. She received Lasix 20mg IV, Kayexelate 30 gm,
and ASA 325mg.

Past Medical History:
1)Obstructive Sleep Apnea on home CPAP, 16cm H20
2)Obesity Hypoventilation
- Multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure; PFT's

consistent with a restrictive defect
- PFTs: FVC 39%, FEV1 37%, FEV1/FVC 96%, TLC 59%, DLCO reduced

3)ASD with right-left shunt (12% shunt fraction documented in
nuclear study from [**2116-3-30**])
4)Pulmonary artery hypertension: Echo in [**10/2118**] demonstrated a
TR gradient of 33mmHg ?????? followed by [**Location (un) 4507**]
5)Hypertension
6)Pan-hypopituitarism with partially empty sella on
desmopressin, levothyroxine, prednisone ?????? followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]
7)Diastolic CHF with dilated RA/LA on previous echo
8)Angioedema (unclear history, possibly related to ACE-I)

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**8-21**]): There is gross cardiomegaly with upper lobe
venous diversion consistent with CHF. There is acute kyphosis
and extensive degenerative change in the lower thoracic spine as
well as the thoracolumbar junction.

2)ECHO ([**8-22**]): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Left atrial dilation with moderate diastolic LV dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo female with PMH as listed above who presents
with 2 week history of worsening dyspnea and chest pain.

1)Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient presented with 2 week
history of worsening shortness of breath. She was found have an
elevated PC02 of ~80 on an ABG. Baseline pCO2 is in the 60's.
She has been hospitalized multiple times for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. She has been compliant with CPAP at home
(which has not been the case in the past per OMR). She does not
appear to volume overloaded on exam. She does admit to some
daily green sputum production, which was suggestive of a
possible underlying infection. She was started on BiPAP in the
emergency room which was continued when she came to the MICU.
She was also started on Levofloxacin and Mucinex for
tracheobronchitis. Over the course of 24 hours her respiratory
status significantly improved and she was transitioned to 1-2L
nasal cannulus.

2)Chest pain: She presented with 2 week history of chest pain,
which resolved quickly in the ED. No history of CAD. Cardiac
enzymes were negative x3, ECG was normal, and there were no
events on telemetry.

3)Leukocytosis: Patient presented with mild leukocytosis of of
12.5. She has history of UTIs on prior admissions but U/A on
this admission was w/o WBCs. She also denies any urinary
frequency or burning. No evidence of pneumonia on cxray but
given history of green sputum production, she may have some
tracheobronchitis. She was placed on 5d course of Levaquin.

4)Diastolic CHF: Last ECHO in [**2118**] with EF>55%. She does not
appear volume overloaded on exam. She received Lasix in the ED;
she is also on Lasix as an outpatient but unclear why. She
underwent an ECHO which showed an increase in her pulmonary
pressures from 33-->50. Her ejection fraction remained the same.
 Lasix was held in the MICU and the floor team should call her
PCP to discuss why this was started.

5)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to "empty sella".
She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] but has missed several
appointments with him. The last time she was hospitalized she
was on Prednisone 15mg PO daily; she was started on 60mg per PCP
notes but after talking with her daughter she had actually been
on 5mg. Endocrinology was consulted to help determine her
regimen. She was continued on Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and
Desmopressin.

6)Hypertension: Continued on outpatient regimen of Lopressor and
Diovan.

Addendum by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge [**2120-8-26**]:  Appointments
were arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (endocrine) on [**9-17**] at
10:30 am and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**] (sleep) on [**10-14**] at 9am.  I called
patient and advised her daughter (English speaking) of the
dates/time and that she must keep these appointments.
