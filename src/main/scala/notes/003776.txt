History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 yo female with DM, HTN, CRI, and recent diagnosis of
small cell lung cancer on chemotherapy who presented to ED with
c/o SOB and wheezing x 2 days on [**2139-1-2**]. Pt was admitted in
[**Month (only) **] for right-sided pleuritic CP, cough, and DOE, which was
thought to be due to post-obstructive PNA (treated with
levaquin/flagyl x 14 days). She had a bronchoscopy w/ needle
aspiration of RUL mass which was positive for malignant cells
consistent with SCLC. After discharge, she was started on
etoposide/cisplatin on [**2138-12-29**] and given IVF hydration.

Ms. [**Known lastname 102272**] presented to the ED [**2139-1-2**] with DOE, found to have
elevated creatinine to 6.2 (baseline 1.2), hyperkalemia,
hyperphosphatemia (9.6), hypercalcemia (8.0). Uric acid found to
be 18.5. Renal felt ARF [**2-19**] tumor lysis and cisplatin toxicity.
Pt was initially on the floor but transferred to the ICU to
initiate CVVH. CVVH was stopped [**2-19**] clot formation.

When pt was transferred to the regular medicine floor, she felt
physically well though anxious. No CP, SOB. No F/C/N/C. +anxiety
about what is going on though feels like she is coping well, son
is coming in in am. She spoke to her therapist  who helped her
feel better.

Selected Radiology:

[**2139-1-2**]- Renal U/S-
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Unchanged septated left lower pole Bosniak type 2 cyst.
3. Multiple bilateral simple cysts.

[**2139-1-3**]- Chest PA/Lat-
Again seen is complete right upper lobe collapse due to the
previously described perihilar mass. Compared to the prior study
there has been interval increase in the amount of right upper
lung collapse with associated expansion of the right lower lung.
The left lung appears clear. There is no new infiltrate or
effusion.

[**2139-1-13**]- Chest PA/LAt-
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild congestive failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral
pleural effusion. Slightly improving atelectasis of the right
upper lobe. Continued right perihilar mass corresponding to the
patient's history of small cell lung cancer.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 68 yo female with DM, CRI, HTN, recently diagnosed stage
IIIa SCLC on chemo p/w tumor lysis, s/p CVVH now on
hemodialysis. Course was complicated by a pancytopenia, febrile
neutropenia, and respiratory issues.

1 Acute Renal failure- pt with underlying diabetic nephropathy,
baseline creatinine 1.0-1.2. Now with acute on chronic renal
failure. Likely [**2-19**] cisplatin toxicity, possible tumor lysis,
and ATN. She is s/p CVVH for hyperurecemia and hypercalcemia
which had to be stopped secondary to clotted lines. Azotemia
slowly resolved over the course of her stay and she began making
urine.  She was continued on allopurinol for hyperurecemia.
Hemodialysis was started and she is s/p tunneled line to the
RIJ; she will continue HD as an outpatient. She was initially on
sevelamer and aluminum hydroxide for hyperphosphatemia which
were d/cd when phosphate levels returned to [**Location 213**]. She was
started on calcium carbonate for persistently low free calcium
which also had to be repleted IV.

2. [**Name (NI) 102273**] Pt had a pancytopenia from cisplatin/etoposide.
Cisplatin usually has a biphasic elimination profile at 24 hours
and 5 days and usually one does not get neutropenia so early.
She may have decreased clearance of cisplatin for some reason.
And etoposide expect decrease counts [**10-31**] d. CBC was checked
[**Hospital1 **].

a. Febrile [**Name (NI) **] Pt was neutropenic with a nadir of 40
neutrophils. She was switched to her own room, put on
neutropenic precautions, and a neutropenic diet. She became
febrile, spiking to 102.5 on [**2139-1-9**]. Vancomycin was started
and dosed by level (<15),  and cefepime was started at
neutropenic fever dosing, though dosed for CrCl <10. She was
pancultured multiple times without finding a source (see c.diff
below). She received neupogen until WBC was >10K for a few days.
She devervesced and the antibiotics were stopped.

b. Anemia- Tranfusion criteria was 21 given that she had no
comorbid disease and baseline Hct around 30. However, given that
pt is dialysis patient per renal wanted Hct higher. She was
transfused in HD multiple times.

Iron studies were consistent with ACD. She was also started on
epoegen by renal. Pt had an episode of epistaxis x 1 in MICU,
and gauaic positive stools here.

c. Thrombocytopenia- transfused for platelets <20 or bleeding.
She received 2 pooled units [**2139-1-8**] for tunneled line placement
and counts came up subsequently along with the other lines.

3. Respiratory status- During the middle of hospitalization, pt
started to get wheezy on exam. She does have a history of
asthma/COPD but she had never had anything like this before. Her
O2 Sats went to the mid-80s on RA and she was put on O2. She
developed stridor one night, but was never in respiratory
compromise. She was immediately
