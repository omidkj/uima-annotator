Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatic mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pylorus sparing Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple Procedure)


History of Present Illness:
This 73-year-old woman has
multiple medical problems including polymyalgia rheumatica
for which she takes steroids.  She has recently had a sigmoid
colectomy for diverticulitis seven months ago and suffered a
postoperative pulmonary embolism from this.  This required
anticoagulation for a six month period, which was just stopped
one week prior to this operation after consultation with her
primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She comes for treatment
of an incidentally found cystic lesion of the head of the
pancreas consistent with IPMT.  Furthermore, cytology from
and endoscopic ultrasound showed mucin and suspicious cells
for atypia.

Hypercholesterolemia
polymyalgia rheumatica

back pain/radiculopathy
s/p left breats biopsy

Social History:
The patient lives alone, in an a bulding with elevators.  The
patient uses a cane for ambulation.  Patient had a homemaker who
assists with shopping and laundry

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
General: No apparent distress
Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm
Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended.  O
Extremities: no clubbing cyanosis or edema
Neuro: alert and oriented.

On discharge the patient had a well healing abdominal wound that
was clean dry and intact.  The patients abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.

Pertinent Results:
Pathology:

Jejunal segment and Whipple specimen
     1.  Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, with low grade
dysplasia.
     2.  All margins and regional lymph nodes are free of tumor.

     3.  Focal atrophy of adjacent pancreas, and dilation of
pancreatic duct.
     4.  Foci of heterotopic stomach and pancreas, in the
proximal part of the  duodenal segment.
     5.  Bile duct and separate jejunal segment; within normal
limits.

[**2177-12-27**]: CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Fluid in the upper abdomen, likely secondary to the recent
surgery an volume overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical service on [**2177-12-24**].
The patient had an uneventful operative procedure, with
approximate blood loss of 500cc and the patient received 8400 cc
of crystalloid resuscitaiton and 1 unit of packed red blood
cells.  Post operatively the patien was comfortable with an
epidural in place for pain control, and the patient had adequate
urine output.  She recieved stress steroids and received a rapid
taper given her history of taking chronic steroids.

On POD #1, the patient was stable and was continued on the
Whipple clinical pathway.  ON post operative day 1 the epidural
was removed and the patients pain was adequately controlled with
a PCA.  She had some uncontrolled hypertension that required a
nitrogycerine drip postoperatively.  This was weaned and the
patient recieved intermittend intravenous lopressor for blood
pressure control.  The patient continued along the whipple
clinical pathway without event until post operative day 3.  On
the evening of POD 3, , her JP drain in the right upper quadrant
changed
character from serous fluid to pure venous blood.  There was
approximately 600 cc of fluid out in [**7-15**] hours.  Her urine
output was marginal and her vital signs were unreliable as a
predictor because she was under beta blockade.  Furthermore,
she had a positive troponin from the night before following some
epigastric pain and  chest discomfort.  A CTA of the chest ruled
out a pulmonary embolism at that time.  Given these findings, we
were concerned for a postoperative bleed especially given her
steroid dependence.  On the morning of postoperative day 4 and
made the decision to re-explore her for control of the bleeding.
 She had an exploratory laparatomy and evacuatoin of a hematoma.
 The patient remained stable and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative days [**6-7**].  Serial hematocrits were followed and
these remained stable.

On postoperative days [**8-9**] it was noted that the patient had
evidence of blood in her Nasogastric tube.  Her hematocrit
dropped to 26.  Her protonix was increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing, she
was given a lavage which became clear after 350 cc, and was
transfused 2 units.  She also recieved FFP.  Her cardiac enzymes
were negative with this event since the patient did not "feel
well".  TPN was started given her poor nutritional status and
the aforementioned events.  Her hematocrit dropped to 25 again
on postoperative day [**9-10**], and she was transfused an additional 2
units of packed redblood cells.  her JP output remained
serosanguinous.  She did have increased dark blood output from
her NG tube opn this day, and given her ongoing upper GI bleed,
the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for
closer monitoring on [**1-1**] (POD [**10-12**]).  It was decided not to
scope the patient given the recent surgery and risk of damage to
the anastamoses. She was started on a protonix drip and serial
hematocrits were monitored.  She had a contined transfusion
requirement.  She remained hemodynamically stable and her output
from her NG tube ceased.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable in the ICU and the
patients hematocrit stabilzed.  The patient was transferred to
the floor on postoperative days [**1-14**].  The patient was started
on a clear liquid diet on post op days 13/9.  her JP output
continued to be stable.  She was given full liquids on post op
day 14/10, and advanced to a regular diet and oral medications
by post operative days 15/11.  She had a JP amylase sent that
was normal.  She had a couple of episodes of self limited bowel
movement positive for blood, but her hematocrit and hemodynamic
monitors remained stable.  Her JP was discontinued and the
patient was stable and ready for discharge to a rehab facility.
