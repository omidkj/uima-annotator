History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 17025**] is 54 y/o female with PMH significant for
obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, nonobstructive coronary disease,
hypertension, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary
hypertension.  Per the patient, she underwent gastric stapling
in
[**2135-7-10**] to treat obesity.  During the surgery, she reportedly
sustained arterial bleeding and significant blood loss.  She
believes she was comatose for over a month.  She was then
transferred to rehab where she significantly improved, and was
recently discharged to home.  She however notes her balance
remains poor, and on [**2135-11-12**] she was walking up steps when she
lost her balance and fell backwards, striking the occipital
portion of her head.  She was unconscious for 4-5 minutes per
the
husband, and she was taken to an OSH.  Head CT at OSH revaeled
small left temporal subdural hematoma with left frontal and
temporal convexity contusions and left sylvian fissure
hemorrhage
noted.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgery
evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2135-11-13**] 12:01 AM:
Hyperdense material in the left sylvian fissure and along the
sulci of the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes is
consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is a focal area
of parenchymal hyperdensity in the anterior left frontal lobe,
consistent with a hemorrhagic contusion. It is not clear whether
a smaller left anterior temporal hemorrhagic contusion is also
present. There is a hyperdense left subdural collection along
the left temporal convexity, measuring up to 3 mm in thickness,
and in the inferior aspect of the anterior interhemispheric
fissure. There is no shift of normally midline structures,
hydrocephalus, or evidence of a major territorial vascular
infarction.

There is a gas-containing laceration and a subgaleal hematoma at
the right
parietal vertex, and a smaller left parietal subgaleal hematoma.
No acute
fractures are identified.

There is fluid and mucosal thickening in the left maxillary
sinus. There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells
bilaterally. There is fluid in some of right mastoid tip air
cells. There is partial opacification of the left mastoid antrum
and the left middle ear cavity.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left subarachnoid hemorrhage. Small left subdural hematoma.
Hemorrhagic
contusion in the left anterior frontal lobe, and possibly also
in the left
anterior temporal lobe.
2. Bilateral subgaleal hematomas.
3. Fluid in the left maxillary sinus and in the right mastoid
air cells.
Partial opacification of the left mastoid antrum and middle ear
cavity.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT [**2135-11-13**] 7:10 AM:
There has been no interval change in the predominantly
left-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage and in the small left
inferior temporal and anterior parafalcine subdural hematoma.
The left anterior frontal and temporal hemorrhagic contusions
are unchanged. There may be a small hemorrhagic contusion in the
anterior right temporal lobe. There is no intraventricular
extent of hemorrhage, and no hydrocephalus.

The subgaleal hematomas are unchanged. The abnormalities in the
paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells and the left middle ear are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage. Unchanged small
left
subdural hematoma. Unchanged left anterior frontal and temporal
hemorrhagic contusion. A likely right anterior frontal
hemorrhagic contusion is now also evident.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2135-11-13**] after a fall. She sustained
a left SDH and left frontal/temporal contusions which was
apparent on the head CT.  Because the blood extends into the
Sylvian fissure and engulfs the carotid, a CTA was obtained.
CTA revealed no evidence of aneurysm or vascular abnormalities.

Repeat head CT 12 hours after the first revealed no interval
progression in terms of the SDH or SAH.  Neurologically the
patient remained stable with baseline right deltoid weakness.
After 24 hours of observation in the NICU, the patient was
transferred to the floor late on [**2135-11-14**].

She worked with PT and OT who felt that she was safe to be
discharged home with home PT and nursing care. Her dilantin was
subtherapeutic so she received extra doses and was sent home
with Keppra. The patient's foley was removed in the am on
[**2135-11-15**] and she was voiding without difficulty prior to
discharge.

At the time of discharge, the patient was oriented x 3 with full
strength throughout Her right deltoid remain week due to prior
injury. The patient was ambulating and taking in food without
difficulty. The patient uses a CPAP machine at home for sleep
apnea which she continued while in the hospital.
