Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH for presumed septic shock (culture
negative) resulting in multi-organ failure (respiratory failure
s/p tracheostomy, acute renal failure, hepatic tranaminitis) &
hemodynamic instability.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

access catheter placement, post-pyloric feeding tube placement,
femoral dialysis catheter placement, removal of tunneled left
subclavian hemodialysis catheter.
.
OSH Lines/procedures: L SCV HD line; Percutaneous CCY drain;
Trach

History of Present Illness:
54 yo M with h/o HTN, AF s/p CV, admitted on [**7-26**] to OSH
with sepsis and acute renal failure. About 6 weeks prior to
admission the patient complained of SOB and went to see his PCP
who ordered [**Name9 (PRE) 11149**] that were reported as 'fine' per the pt's wife.
One week later the patient was involved in a MVA with ? of LOC,
air bags deployed, he did have his seat belt on, and was brought
to [**Hospital 1121**] Hospital. There, he was noted to be in afib, and
was started on coumadin. His course was also complicated by
labile BP's, put on alcohol detox, but his wife felt that the
patient had no cause to be withdrawing. He was d/c'd [**7-1**], on
coumadin, with the idea that he would follow up for
cardioversion in the near future.
 Following his discharge, he had 2 weeks of not 'feeling right',
complaining of worsening dyspnea, extreme fatigue, no cough or
fever. He presented to [**Hospital1 487**] complaining of severe shortness
of breath. His vitals there were BP 191/60, HR 65, RR 34, 95% on
100% NRB. Labs were notable for a WBC 22,100, 20% bands, 60%
neutrophils, K 6.8, BUN 46, Cr 4.2, lactic acid 18.8, AST 4560,
ALT 3528, Alk Phos 72. A CTA was performed, which was negative
for PE, but noted marked cardiomegaly, trace pericardial
effusion, reflux into IVC suggestive of right heart failure,
small air in pericardial space, hypoperfusion of the
intraabdominal arteries suggestive of decreased cardiac output,
trace pelvic ascites, and edema of gallbladder wall.
.
The following is a summary of events of his hospital stay up
until transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] (bulleted for ease of summarizing
complicated course):
- [**7-26**] - admitted to [**Hospital3 **], ABG 7.12/29.3/86.2 on
100% O2
- next ABG 6.97/43.2/131.9/9.6
- pt. bradycardic and hypotensive, K - 6.5
- Mult boluses with Sodium Bicarb > improved brady
- pressors for hypoT, started initially on levophed
- blood cx and sputum sent
- Pt intubated
- CTA neg for PE
- admitted to ICU for presumed PNA and resp failure, ARF req HD,
hepatitis, sepsis
- Abd US - ? of biliary source
- Nephrology consult - thought ethylene glycol ingestion- neg
- cholecystostomy tube placed with marked drainage per IR but
neg cx
- [**Doctor First Name **] consult - no surgical source multi-organ failure
- ID - consult - placed on broad spectrum anti-abx with vanco,
zosyn, levo, then switched to vanco/etrapenem
- persistent afib - cardizem drip for rate control per cardio
c/s
- able to be titrated off all pressors
- Ileus - put on TPN
- [**Date range (1) 31312**] - low grade fevers that increased again, normal WBC,
hypotension required re-addition of pressors,
levophed/dopamine/vasopressin added. Eventually weaned to just
neosynephrine to avoid reflex tachycardia.
- ID consulted - changed lines, triple lumen grew MSSA
- pan cultures otherwise neg
- persistent severe anemia req mult transfusion (30 units
pRBC's)
- thrombocytopenia improving (thought to be secondary to
heparin)
- worsening hypoT despite resolution of fevers, titrated up on
neo
- stress dose of steroids initiated [**8-11**]
- ID - recommended vanco/meropenem/caspo, but patient already
defervescing
- daily HD continued
- transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management on [**8-13**] at 1am
