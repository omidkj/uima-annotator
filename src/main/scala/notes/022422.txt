IMAGING
CXR [**2112-12-30**]
Relatively stable examination with no definite acute pulmonary
process
.
CT C spine [**2112-12-30**]
No acute traumtic injury. Degenerative changes as above.
.
CT head [**2112-12-30**]
Small amount of right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Gven size
and distribution and given history, post traumatic etiology
suspected. No mass effect.
.
MRI head 2/2.08
1. Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage along the sulci in the right
frontal lobe at the site of hypodensity seen on CT.
2. Extensive bifrontal and right medial parietal superficial
siderosis.
3. Moderate-to-severe brain and medial temporal atrophy.
4. Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease
5. No evidence of acute infarct.
.
CT abdomen [**2112-12-31**]
1. Saddle pulmonary embolism with relatively greater clot burden
on the right. Echocardiography may be useful as clinically
indicated to assess for right heart strain.
2. Renal cysts some of which are greater density than simple
fluid, probably due to protein content.
3. Small amount of free pelvic fluid is nonspecific.
.
IVC filter placement [**2112-12-31**]
Uneventful placement of infrarenal OptEase IVC filter from the
right common femoral venous approach.
.
ECHO [**12-31**]/-08
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate-to-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. Suboptimal image quality -
patient unable to cooperate.

IMPRESSION: dilated, severely hypocontractile right ventricle;
moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED the patients vitals were Tmax 99.8, HR 70-77, BP SBP
(82-119)/(43-84), RR 28-40, Sat 88% on 4L, then 100% on
Non-rebreather. He received 5 Liters of NS, levofloxacin 750mg
x1, ceftriaxone 1gm x1, flagyl 500mg IV x 1, and 8 units of
regular insulin. Insulin drip was started at 6 units/hour. He
was started on levophed titrated up to 0.09mcg/kg. Finger stick
prior to CT scan was 401. Peak glucose of 500.  Patient had a
lactate that peaked at 5.8.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was pan-scanned. He had a head CT which was
questionable for a small SAH. It was read as such by the ED
radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2026**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Neurosurgery was
consulted. Neurosurgery resident and neurosurgery attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 548**] felt that there was no SAH, and what was seen was
artifact. Neurosurg signed off, because they felt there was no
bleed.
.
Pt was found to have large saddle embolus when scanning abdomen
for possible ischemic bowel.
.
Unable to send pt for repeat head CT as he did received contrast
for his CT chest. At time of admission still discussing final
decision and further head imaging for patient.
.
Pt was confused and unable to answer questions. Unable to obtain
ROS.
.
Impression: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o man found down, noted in
the ED to be hypotensive, w/ desat, AG of 17, BG 500, w/ renal
failure Acute vs. Chronic, noted to have CT read of head w/
debate of artifact vs. SAH, found to have massive pulmonary
embolus on CT scan. He was transferred from ED on
Non-rebreather, levophed for BP, and Insulin drip, DNR/DNI.
.
# Saddle Pulmonary Embolus: Pt had massive pulmonary embolism,
that has lead to ms changes, LOC, hypoxia, hypotension, elevated
lactate, leukocytosis, and likely stress response causing
glucose elevation.
Pt was hemodynamically unstable from pulmonary embolism. There
is debate as to whether or not pt had SAH bleed on head CT,
radiology says maybe, neurosurg states it is an artifact.
Discussed final read with all parties. Unable to repeat head CT,
because CT chest dye load would interfere with ability to tell
if SAH occurred. head imaging showed bleed (confirmed by MRI),
no heparin, placed IVC filter
pending consensus no head bleed, planned to give intra-pulm cath
thrombolytics becaue the benefit of lytics likely outweighs risk
at this point in time.
TTE was done for right heart strain, with results as reported.
Fluid bolus were given PRN, as he is preload dependent, kept CVP
15-20.
.
#: Altered Mental Status: Patient found down unconscious, he had
an underlying baseline of alzeimers. Unclear what caused LOC.
Initially felt to be secondary to metabolic or infectious
etiology given finding concerning for DKA (glucose 500s, ketones
in urine, AG=17) and Sepsis(leukocytosis 18, elevated lactate
5.8, hypotension, desat). Finding of massive saddle PE, expl
