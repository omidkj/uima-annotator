Chief Complaint:
cough, dyspnea, O2 requirement, tranaminitis

liver biopsy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 4580**] is a 59 year old male with monoclonal
gammopathy,
severe oral lichen planus, recent GIST tumor s/p surgical
resection
[**2170-12-27**], possible neuromuscular disorder who presents with cough
and fever X 3 days.
.
His symptoms began three days ago beginning with one day of low
grade fever to 100.4, cough, and fatigue. He was noted to have
increased O2 requirement and transaminitis and was referred to
the ED. Patient has had no abdominal or GI symptoms.
.
Of note patient has had a long and complicated medical history
beginning in [**2169-8-20**] when he suddenly lost his sense of
taste after treatement of social anxiety with proproanolol. It
was the start of a progressive course of oral lichen planus. Due
to loss of taste, he last 20 lbs. He developed respiratory
problems including a number of sinus infections in the summer of
[**2170**] requiring treatmetn with antibitotics. Workup by his PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 7837**] "abnormal immunoglobulin levles, further evaluated with
bone marrow biopsy revealing MGUS. He began to develop rashes,
and worsening of his oral lichen planus with mouth, pain and
thrush. He had biopsies of his tongue confirming diagnosis
lichen planus. Biopsy of plaques on the dorum of his knuckles
were suggestive of Gottren's papules, making diagnosis
concerning for dermatomyositis. Given patient had not had
weakness consistent with this, it was suggested that he had a
diagnosis of sine dermatomyositis. Later with subsequent biopsy,
this diagnosis was challenged with systemic lichen planus.
Furthermore, as dermatomyositis was raised, patient underwent an
exhausive workup for malignancy including colonsocopy and
endoscopy. A gastric mass was discovered, found to be a benign
GIST tumor. Throughout these hospitalization, patient became
malnourished as workup for his symptoms continued. He developed
several pneumonia . During his most recent hospitalization for
low grade temperature, cough, and hypoxia, he was found to have
a possible aspiration and/or bronchiectasis/bronchiolitis with
resultant transpulmonary
shunt. Sputum cultures grew MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
He was treated with a 10day course of cipro and cefazolin. At
time of discharge he was satting in the low 90s on room air with
ambulatory sats in the mid-90s on room air. A cause of his
weakness has not been discovered. Neurology has recommended a
voltage gated calcium channel antibiody [**Hospital1 **] nicotinic receptor
binding antibody which must be ordered as outpatient. Weakness
was also thought to be the cuase of his aspiration risk and NIF
of -40. It was unclear whether this was a neuromuscular process
or rheumatologic condition. Decision was made to initiate
treatment with steroids. Patient's breathing improved (NIF
improved to -80). He was discharged on a prolonged steroid
course.
.
Of note, skin biopsy recently showed overlap between lichen
planus and connective tissue disorder (lichen planus with immune

deposition). Serologic tests include: negative [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA,
anti-synthetase antibodies and normal CK. Inflammatory markers
were markedly elevated. Sine dermatomyositis was suggested, but
seems less likely based on his clinical course.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.7 102 101/60 22. He
triggered for hypoxia 84% on RA. CXR from earlier in the day was
clear. He was not given antibiotics. He was admitted for
management of hypoxia. He was given 1L NS. Vital sings on
tranfer were: 112/75, 101, 90% 4L nc.
.
On the floor, patient has no new complaints. Looking forward to
returning home.

CXR:
 PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-10**] through [**1-16**],
extent of peribronchial thickening and impaction of extensive
bibasilar
bronchiectasis may have increased slightly since the most recent
prior lateral chest radiograph, [**1-10**]. There is really no
change in the appearance of the frontal views as recently as
[**1-16**]. Generalized hyperinflation is due to emphysema.
Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema,
consolidation. A tiny right pleural effusion may be new, but
probably not clinically significant. Findings would therefore be
attributed to decompensation of emphysema and bronchiectasis.

RUQ U/S:
1. Normal hepatic Doppler examination.
2. Sludge and likely polyps within the gallbladder. No
pericholecystic fluid or wall thickening.

CT Abd: 1. Bibasilar bronchiectasis with mucoi
