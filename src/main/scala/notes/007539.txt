CHIEF COMPLAINT:  AICD firing.

The patient is a 56-year-old male with coronary disease,
cardiomyopathy with EF of 20 percent, 3 plus MR, Afib status
post cardioversion, and COPD, who presents with AICD firing.
The patient was in his usual state of health until this
afternoon when he felt a little woozy on his way to the
dishwasher.  He sat down and at that time his AICD fired for
a total of nine shocks from the time he was at home to the
time he presented to the Emergency Room.  He also noted [**6-4**]
substernal chest discomfort 30 minutes before the first AICD
firing with associated nausea.  No radiating chest pain, no
diaphoresis.  Currently, the patient was chest pain free.
The patient denies any history of recent PND, orthopnea, or
lower extremity swelling.

In the Emergency Room, he was noted to be in V-tach and was
shocked again by his AICD three more times.  He was
eventually started on a lidocaine drip.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lisinopril 5 q.d.
2. Aspirin 325 q.d.
3. Plavix 75 q.d.
4. Lasix 40 q.d.
5. Digoxin 0.125 q.d.
6. Lipitor 20 q.d.
7. Atrovent.
8. Toprol XL 25 q.d.
9. Dofetilide 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10.      Coumadin.
11.      Protonix 40.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of
20 percent.

Coronary artery disease with stent to LAD in [**12-28**].

COPD.

Afib.

Status post pacemaker and AICD implantation in [**12-28**].

Dyslipidemia.

On exam, the patient was sitting in bed, anxious, and in no
acute distress.  His vital signs are stable.  His jugular
venous pressure was approximately 10 cm.  His lungs were
clear except for fine crackles of his left base.  His heart
had regular, rate, and rhythm.

An EKG on the day of admission at 14:47 showed polymorphic
VT.  After the shock by his defibrillator, his subsequent EKG
showed normal sinus at 88 with normal axis and intervals,
inferior Q waves, and poor R-wave progression.

SIGNIFICANT LABORATORY DATA:  His INR was 2.8.  His potassium
was 3.3, which is repleted in the Emergency Room and his
magnesium was 1.7.  First set of cardiac enzymes were
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient presented with ventricular
tachycardia and multiple shocks from his AICD.  The patient
had three sets of cardiac enzymes, which were checked and he
ruled out for MI.  It was felt by the EP team that the most
likely etiology of his ventricular tachycardia was due to the
dofetilide in combination with hypomagnesemia and
hypokalemia.  His dofetilide was stopped and the patient was
started on amiodarone.  His digoxin was also D/C'd.  His
lidocaine drip was eventually weaned off.

Of note, the patient did have a small troponin leak with flat
CK's and MB's, and this was thought to be due to the shocks
themselves and not from ischemia.  His Toprol XL was
increased to 37.5 q.d.  He was continued on 5 of lisinopril
and also started on Aldactone 25 for potassium-sparing
effect.  Of note, the patient had no further episodes of AICD
firing while in the hospital.  He did have short runs of
NSVT, the longest of which was five beats.

The patient also had a very difficult time coping with the
number of shocks he received.  The patient does have a
history of anxiety disorder for which he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
his psychiatrist.  The patient during his hospital stay was
very concerned about events leading to his hospitalization
and repeatedly expressed feelings of anxiety.  He also stated
at times he wished that he did not have the defibrillator in,
and would rather have it out.  It was explained to the
patient numerous times that the defibrillator saved his life
and that if it had not been in, he would have died.

The Psychiatry consult was obtained while in-house, and they
recommended starting Klonopin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.  The patient
will also follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist as well.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Ventricular tachycardia secondary to
dofetilide toxicity and electrolyte abnormalities.

Congestive heart failure.

AICD firing.

Anxiety.

Depression.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient has several follow-up
appointments including with his primary care doctor, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  He also has an appointment for an outpatient set of
pulmonary function tests given the fact that he will be on
amiodarone.  He also has a followup with both the Heart
Failure Clinic and Pacemaker Clinics.  He also has a followup
with his outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

1. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
3. Plavix 75 q.d.
4. Lipitor 20 q.d.
5. Atrovent inhaler.
6. Protonix 40 q.d.

11.      Klonopin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12.      Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.  He was instructed to
   followup with the Heart Failure Clinic on [**6-26**] to get
   his Coumadin levels checked.
13.      Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. q.d.
