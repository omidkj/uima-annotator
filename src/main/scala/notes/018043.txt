Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Vision loss.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 71 year-old right-handed gentleman who presented
with acute onset right-sided visual loss.

He was in his usual state of health until 8:30 this evening when
he developed the acute onset of right-sided visual loss.  His
daughter called an ophthalmologist who lives in the neighborhood
who came to assess the pt.  He apparently diagnosed a right
hemianopia and advised calling EMS over concern for stroke.  The
pt was transported via EMS to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Code Stroke was called
on arrival (10:13pm), the Neurology resident was at bedside by
10:15pm.  NIHSS was performed immediately and was 2 (for
complete hemianopia).  Blood was drawn and he was taken
emergently for CT scan of the head.  This revealed no ICH.  The
risks and benefits of IV tPA were discussed with the pt by the
Stroke Fellow.  It was decided to administer tPA given the
potential disability caused by this deficit.  IV bolus of tPA
(based on wt of 70kg) was administered at 11:18pm.

The pt otherwise offered no complaints.  He did state, however,
that all night last night and until roughly 11:30am, he was
experiencing palpitations, which he has been known to experience
in the past.

The pt denied headache, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria,
dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing
difficulty. Denied difficulties producing or comprehending
speech.  Denied focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel
or bladder incontinence or retention. Denied difficulty with
gait.

On review of systems, the pt denied recent fever or chills.  No
night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough,
shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or tightness.  Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No
recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:
-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

brisk. On confrontation, there is a complete right visual field
hemianopia in the right eye and more of a crescenteric right
visual field deficit in the left eye (i.e. it is noncongruous).
There is no ptosis bilaterally. Funduscopic exam revealed no
papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages. EOMI without nystagmus.
Normal saccades. Facial sensation intact to pinprick. No facial
droop, facial musculature symmetric. Hearing intact to
finger-rub bilaterally.  Palate elevates symmetrically.  [**6-1**]
strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally. Tongue protrudes in
midline.

-motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. Strength was full
throughout. No pronator drift bilaterally. No adventitious
movements noted.

-sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout. No extinction
to DSS.

-coordination: No intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted. No
dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.

BRAIN MRI:
There is subtle signal abnormalities seen in the medial left
occipital lobe which is only visualized on the diffusion images
without corresponding abnormalities on the ADC map or on the
FLAIR or T2-weighted images. These findings are suspicious for
an acute infarct. Clinical correlation and followup examination
are recommended. There is mild prominence of sulci. Subtle
periventricular hyperintensities are noted due to small vessel
disease. There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. Mucosal
thickening is seen in both maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Subtle diffusion abnormality in the medial left
occipital lobe suspicious for an early infarct. Consider
clinical correlation and followup.

MRA OF THE HEAD:
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation. Normal flow signal is seen
in both posterior cerebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolus other history of PAF
found. However, transthoracic echo not adequate to assess for
atrial thrombus.

Carotid Ultrasound: Prelim read was no significant stenosis
bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Left occipital stroke: Exam on presentation was notable for a
noncongruous right homonymous hemianopia.  Due to the potential
disability derived from this deficit, the decision was made to
give the pt IV tPA in the emergency department.  He was
therefore admitted to the ICU for observation 24 hours.
Unfortunately, his deficits did not resolve.  MRI demonstrated
an area of restricted diffusion in the left occipital lobe.  MRA
of the brain was normal.  Etiology was felt to be cardioembolic
given paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was started on
warfarin. TTE demonstrated no thrombus. Carotid ultrasonography
was normal.  He was found to be hyperlipidemic and was started
on atrovastatin.  He was also found to have an elevated glycated
hemoglobin and fasting glucose.  This should be followed-up with
his PCP on his return to [**Country 532**].

2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: This was felt to be the
etiology of the stroke.  He was started on warfarin.  He was
also continued on sotalol.

3. Hyperlipidemia: The pt was found to have elevated total
cholesterol and LDL. he was started on 10mg of atorvastatin
daily.
