Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**]
Chief Complaint:
lower extremity weakness, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8789**] is an 87-yo man with history of colon cancer
(refusing treatment), PAF, CHF with chronic pleural effusions
who presented with lower extremity weakness and was found to be
hypoxic with O2 sat in the 80s requiring NRB and MICU admission.
.
The patient was mostly recently admitted on [**2188-6-20**] for
hypotension likely from dehydration. He was given IVF and was
discharged on [**2188-6-21**] with amox-clav for UTI. A day later, on
the day of this admission, he felt as if his legs were "rubbery"
and that he had difficulty ambulating even with his walker. He
denies dyspnea, chest pain, lightheadedness, or worsening of his
leg edema. He denies fevers, chills, coughs, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, constipatin, dysuria.
.
On arrival to the ED, T 101.2, BP 117/50, HR 76, RR 22, 89%RA.
His CEs were negative x 1. CXR revealed worsening R pleural
effusion. He received 1 liter NS, ceftriaxone 2 grams,
levofloxacin 750 mg. Due to his hypoxia, he required NRB and was
admitted to the MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
Colonoscopy [**2184-3-25**]:
>Polyp in the transverse colon (polypectomy) - adenoma
>Polyps in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)- Colonic mucosa with
focal hyperplastic features
>Polypoid, ulcerated mass in the hepatic flexure (biopsy) -
Superficial fragments of colonic mucosa with ulceration, marked
acute inflammation, and highly atypical glands, suspicious for
carcinoma.


Past history:
# Colon mass during colonoscopy for guaiac positive stools in
[**2184**]. Pathology was worrisome for carcinoma. Although the
patient was offered resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he declined
# hematuria/BPH - traumatic foley insertion and manipulation
[**3-16**] lead to urosepsis and subsequent urinary retention
# sick sinus syndrome and bifascicular block s/p pacemaker [**2184**]

# PAF - on amiodarone, not on coumadin d/t concern for
malignancy
# H/O SVT
# Atrial flutter status post ablation [**2-/2186**] - not on
anticoagulation d/t concern for malignancy
# Anemia - on arenesp and iron
# Echo [**2186**]: mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, RA and LA
# BPH s/p TURMP [**2187**]
# b/l edema with skin changes
# hard of hearing
# hx of guiaic positive stools/GI bleeding
# osteoarthritis
# osteoporosis
# subclinical hypothyroid state as per record
# [**Year (4 digits) **] insufficiency
# right pleural effusion - Found on CT on [**2188-2-25**] for increasing
DOE. [**3-6**] and [**3-18**] thoracentesis c/w transudative. Workup during
last admission revealed RV diastolic dysfunction. Concern was
for PE as etiology, but unable to get CTA d/w ARF and V/Q not
helpful. Not anticoagulated due to h/o GIB, pleurodesis not an
option d/t transudative.
# Tibial talar dislocation with comminuted distal tib fib
fracture status post surgery [**2181**]
# hx syncope in [**2181**], unclear etiology

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with hypoxia and was intially sent to
the ICU. He was diuresed, but also started on Vanc, Flagyl and
Levofloxacin empirically. After diuresis, his oxygenation
improved and he was transfered to the floor. He was continued on
abx empirically but they were discontinued after 48hours of
negative cultures. He was then switched back to Augmentin to
complete a course for UTI started on last admssion.  It is
likely that he experienced a CHF exacerbation [**2-23**] to the IVF
given on last admission and [**2-23**] to decreased lasix on discharge.
His "weakness" was consistent with deconditioning and poor
cardiopulmonary status on admission rather than focal leg
weakness. On exam, strength was [**5-26**] in LE and his walked very
well with PT. His ambulation improved with diuresis. TSH was
normal. Diuresis was continued. His hypoxia continued to improve
with 90-94% RA and on ambulation. He continued to refuse
thoracentesis. He did have rare desturations at night to 87% and
may benefit from O2 at night in the future. He also received 2
units pRBC's for HCT below baseline. He was discharged without
shortness of breath or hypoxia on his orginal home dose of lasix
40mg daily.
