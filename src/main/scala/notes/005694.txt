CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant
55-year-old female who was transferred from the [**Hospital3 49333**], and was admitted directly to the Intensive
Care Unit on [**2178-4-15**].  The patient has a history of
hypertension and diabetes who had a recent abdominal ventral
hernia repair on [**2178-4-7**] for incarcerated bowel.  She
did well until postoperative day #6 when she developed some
chest pain and dyspnea.  At that time, there was a concern
for a pulmonary embolism, and she was started on IV Heparin.
The patient was transferred directly to the MICU of the [**Hospital1 1444**].  She was scheduled to get a
CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism, but given the
fact that she had a depressed creatinine clearance and the
presence of only one kidney that was held off at only one
time.

In addition, she received an echocardiogram that revealed no
RV strain, and lower extremity noninvasive studies were also
done that was negative for a clot.  Patient also had a
Swan-Ganz catheter placed that was found to be consistent
with septic physiology, and so it was concluded at that time
that she most likely has a septic shock rather than a
pulmonary embolus.

The patient had a colonoscopy while she was in the Intensive
Care Unit, and it was found that she had pseudomembranous
colitis.  At that time, she was started on po Vancomycin and
IV Flagyl.  In addition, the patient also complained of some
abdominal distention and was found to have an ileus, and so
all po were held, and PICC line was placed, and the patient
was started on TPN.  The only po she received was
medications, more specifically to help clear up her
pseudomembranous colitis.  The patient was intubated for
hypoxia and respiratory distress and was extubated on [**2178-4-19**].  Before being transferred to the floor, the patient was
aggressively diuresed with a goal of [**12-18**] liters negative by
receiving IV Lasix since she received excessive amounts of
fluid when she initially presented and was hypotensive.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSIONS:  Vital signs:  Temperature is
98.7, pulse 104, blood pressure 153/68, respiratory rate 24,
and O2 saturation 99% on 4 liters.  General:  The patient was
comfortable, sitting on chair, in no acute distress.  Lungs:
Decreased breath sounds bilateral bases with some rhonchi.
Heart:  S1, S2 regular, rate, and rhythm with tachycardia.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops heard.  Abdomen is soft, obese,
distended, some bowel sounds.  Extremities:  [**12-18**]+ upper and
lower extremity edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION TO THE FLOOR:  White count 12.9,
hematocrit 31.9, platelets 334.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.8,
chloride 102, bicarb 24, BUN 17, creatinine 0.7, glucose 242,
calcium 8.4, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 3.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 55-year-old female who was
recently transferred out of Medical Intensive Care Unit after
presenting there from an outside hospital for hypoxia,
hypotension, concern for pulmonary embolus, and was found to
be in septic shock secondary to pseudomembranous colitis.
The patient was started on IV Flagyl and po Vancomycin and
was extubated on [**2178-4-19**].  The patient is doing well at
this time.

1. Pseudomembranous colitis:  The patient is currently on
Flagyl 500 mg po tid and Vancomycin 125 mg po qid.  The case
was discussed with the ID team, who recommended that given
the patient's history of pseudomembranous colitis, and the
fact that she is still having some diarrhea, although her
Clostridium difficile toxin is negative, it would be
reasonable to continue treatment for a total of two weeks
with her antibiotics.  The patient is going to be discharged
from the hospital to an acute rehab with two weeks additional
course of both Flagyl and Vancomycin.

2. Hypoxia:  The patient most likely has hypoxia secondary to
a combination of atelectasis along with congestive heart
failure.  This patient received aggressive fluids in the unit
for resuscitation.  The patient has been receiving aggressive
IV Lasix, and the patient has been diuresing about 1-1.5
liters everyday, and her breathing substantially improved.
On the day of discharge, the patient's O2 saturation was
anywhere between 94-98% on [**12-18**] liters with a nasal cannula.
In addition, the concern for pulmonary embolus was very
minimal, and was more consistent with atelectasis.  The
patient was continuing getting albuterol and Atrovent
inhalers along with chest PT and incentive spirometry, and
was often encouraged to move out of bed to the chair, and the
patient's breathing improved tremendously.

3. Hypertension:  Patient was consistently hypertensive
during the hospital course, and so was started on Captopril
25 mg po tid, and was titrated upwards to 100 mg po tid.  At
day of discharge, the patient's blood pressure remained
stable with a systolic blood pressure in the range of
120-140s.  The patient was currently on 100 mg po tid.

4. Renal:  The patient is status post left nephrectomy and
was in acute renal failure in presentation, but most likely
in the setting of prerenal since the patient was dry and
hypertensive.  After receiving aggressive IV fluids, the
patient's creatinine is now back to baseline, and on the day
of discharge, the patient's creatinine was 0.6.

5. Diabetes:  Patient was being covered with regular sliding
scale insulin while in hospital with fingersticks qid.  The
patient is to continue getting the same while in
rehabilitation because switching over to her po Glucophage
500 mg po q day.  This will be done at the rehabilitation
prior to her discharge to home.

6. FEN:  Patient had an ileus while in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, and so the patient was kept NPO, and received
nutrition through her PICC line.  The patient received TPN,
but as patient's symptoms improved and was starting to pass
gas, the patient's diet was advanced.  She was initially
started on clear liquids followed by full liquids, and the
day prior to discharge, the patient was started on a bland
low residual diet which she tolerated well.  At that time it
was decided it would be reasonable to stop the TPN.  The
patient was tolerating full po.
