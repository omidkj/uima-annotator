Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 107582**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-4-26**] after a fall at
home.  She was evaluated by the orthopaedic surgery service and
found to have a left hip fracture.  She was admitted to medicine
and cleared for surgery.  On [**2170-4-27**] she was taken to the
operating room and underwent a left hip TFN.  During the surgery
it was noted that she had a lacerated profunda artery.  [**Date Range **]
surgery was called in and she also underwent repair of her
artery.  She was estimated to have lost 2.5L of blood and was
transfused a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells.  She
was transferred to the ICU post operatively for further care.
She was transfused an additional 1 unit of packed red blood
cells.  On [**2170-4-28**] she was transfused with 3 units of packed red
blood cells due to acute blood loss anemia.  On [**2170-4-29**] she was
transferred from the ICU to the orthopaedic floor.  She was seen
by physical therapy to improve her strength and mobility.  On
[**2170-4-30**] she was again transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood
cells. Internal Medicine was re-consulted for post operative
fluid overload. Her ins and outs were closely monitored and Ms.
[**Known lastname 107582**] improved on her home dose Lasix over the last days.
Her hct remained stable.  She underwent arteriogram prior to D/C
at the recommendation of the [**Known lastname **] Surgery team which did not
shoe any abnormality.  The rest of her hospital stay was
uneventful with her lab data and vital signs within normal
limits and her pain controlled.  She was discharged to rehab in

coordinated.  She will follow up with [**Known lastname **] Surgery in 1
