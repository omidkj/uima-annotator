but refused transport to the ED for eval at that time. She
continued to have a headache today on the day of admission and
so presented to the ED [**2123-2-19**]. There she had a runny nose,
cough, and received benadryl and compazine. She fell asleep and
de-sated to 60% on room air. She was placed on Bipap and
transfered to the MICU

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Respiratory distress: Pt presented w/ 02 sat in the 60s but
asymptomatic. Reason for acute desaturation not entirely clear.
However, she has had prior episodes of 02 sats in the 60s as an
outpatient (per OMR notes) as well. The patient has severe,
underlying cardiopulmonary disease, which may have transiently
worsened in the setting of sedating medications. ABG not done on
admission, so not clear how hypercarbic she was (her venous HCO3
on admission was 40, which is her ~baseline). She briefly went
to the ICU for close monitoring but no active intervention.  She
has been on sildenafil since [**2120-10-29**] (not a new med for her)
and this was continued.  Her O2 sat improved without
intervention to the 90s on 2-3Liters.  She continued her home
BIPAP while in the hospital in addition to her home inhalers.
Her primary pulmonoligst was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss her baseline
respiratory status; and per his report this appears to be her
baseline. No further interventions/changes made.
.
# Recent fall/pre-syncope: Pt reports feeling lightheaded prior
to fall on day PTA. Suspect she may have been hypoxic or perhaps
hypotensive during episode. Her BPs have been in the 80s-110s
here, while off of her BP meds, which she reports taking as
prescribed. Thus, it is possible that her BP has been signif
below 80s while taking her BP meds. Head CT negative, neuroexam
normal. Pt ruled out for MI. No events on tele noted. (Pt has
been on these BP meds for past 6 months)  Her Toprol and
Lisinoprol were not restarted given her low BP and this will be
reassessed as an outpatient.
.
# Pulmonary Hypertension/Cor Pulmonale -Pt was on sildenafil
which was continued while in the hospital.  Initially her Lasix
was held but this was restarted on hospital day # 2. A repeat
ECHo showed similar pulmonary HTN as compared to her previous
ECHO from [**2121-12-29**]. No further changes made to her pulmonary
medications.

.
# HTN: Pt was initially more hypotensive with SBP 80-90s.  Her
blood pressure meds were held.  Despite her diastolic heart
failure, her Toprol and Lisinopril were held on discharge as her
BP continued to remain in the 90-110 systolic.
.
# Diastolic Heart Failure: Pt had repeat ECHO during her
hosptialization which showed a hyperdyanmic EF of 75% but
unchanged from her previous in [**2121-12-29**].  Her beta blocker
and ACE were held give her low BP and thought it may contribute
to her symptoms.  They were not restarted on discharge. It was
felt she should follow up with her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]s her BP and determine if the BB could be restarted at a
later date.
.
#Hyperkalemia-Pt had potassium of 5.2 on day of discharge; no
treatment given as patient is on lasix and usually they become
hypokalemic.  Pt had appt with nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4171**] day
after discharge. I called to ask them to check her potassium
tomorrow.  Given that the patient is on lasix and has a
relatively  high potassium (that has trended up over past 6
months) she may warrant further evaluation as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a headache and found to
have a low oxygen in your blood.  This was concerning and you
went to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. It was
felt that your headache may be related to the fact that your
blood pressure was low and because you had low Oxygen.

There were some changes to your medications.
You will no longer take your Toprol (blood pressure medicine)
and we stopped your Lisinopril.  Please discuss these
medications with your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 19039**].

You will continue to take the lasix 80mg twice daily as you were
previously.

If you have any change in your breathing, shortness of [**Last Name (Titles) 1440**],
headache, confusion, weakness or fatigue, chest pain, or
increased swelling in your feet, please call your doctor or
return to the ER.  Also, if you feel very lightheaded, please
