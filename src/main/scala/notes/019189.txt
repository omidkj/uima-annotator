Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
89yoF Russian speaking with CAD, EF 45% on last echo [**5-/2103**],
HTN, AFib on Coumadin who was admitted to Cardiology [**2108-9-3**]
for progressive SOB/DOE for the past [**2-9**] wks, progressing to SOB
at rest; also with increased wt, upper and lower extremity
swelling, PND, orthopnea such that has been sleeping straight
up; but no CP, syncope, or palpitations. Failed outpt management
of CHF exacerbation with increase of PO Lasix 60 mg to 120mg.
VNA noted low O2 sats, sent her to [**Hospital 191**] clinic where she had
cyanotic lips, and then sent to ED where she was 121/68 p76 and
100% on 4L NC. CXR consistent with a very large heart, bilateral
patchy opacities and L > R pleural effusion; also with BNP 5500
(no baseline) and Cr 2.3 up from 1.7 back in [**4-/2108**], and
baseline appears to be mid 1's.
.
She was given 80 mg IV Lasix in the ED, and through admission to
Cardiology was given 60 mg IV Lasix instead of the intended 120
mg IV due to concern for hypoTN. Review of her floor vitals
shows progressive decrease in her SBP's from 110's to 90's,
reported 70's by the primary team this am, and is 85 on
evaluation most recently.
.
Through her course, she was diuresed as above; ACEi, beta
blocker, and Coumadin have been held; echo has just been done
this am; CE's have been trended which are only minimally
elevated Trop's (0.1-0.11) with negative MB's. There was also of
note a concern for LLL PNA vs atelectasis for which she was
given IV Levaquin x1, but this was not continued on the floor
(she denies cough, fever, and WBC's are low)
.
She is transferred to CCU for aggressive monitoring of blood
pressure while being diuresed.
.
ROS as above, otherwise negative.

short sentences, not in extremis but her lips, tongue, and
fingertips are notably cyanotic. EOMI, no scleral icterus, mouth

pulsations noted about 4.5 cm above her earlobe for total JVP
~12cm above RA level at ~45 degrees, +HJR
Back is notably kyphotic, lung sounds very diminished with poor
respiratory effort but gross wet sounding crackles noted
diffusely and gross expiratory wheezes as well
Irregular S1/S2 but no murmurs appreciated, nor S3/S4
Abdomen is soft but obese, NT ND, benign
BLE with gross anasarca to the thighs, and bilateral shins
exhibit gross chronic lymphedematous changes reminischent of
elephantiasis with scaly hyperkeratosis on a diffuse background
of chronic erythematous hyperpigmentation; also with pitting
edema.
CN 2-12 grossly intact, alert and attentive to conversation;
full neuro exam deferred at present

ON DISCHARGE:
Sitting in bedside chair. Cyanosis has resolved, appears much
improved. Minimal JVD and basilar crackles. BLE edema and
chronic venous stasis changes are improved.

ECHO [**9-3**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least
15 mmHg. There is mild basal left ventricular hypertrophy with a
suggestion of "burnt out" apical left ventricular hypertrophy
and associated aneurysm versus prior apical infarct (1.5 x 1.7
cm apical aneurysm without thrombus seen). The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular ejection
fraction is borderline as other segments are hyperdynamic (LVEF=
50%). There is a 1.0 cm spheroid/sessile mass (clips [**6-13**]) seen
in the LVOT about the anterior mitral annulus which is mixed
calcified/non-calcified in appearance (suggestive of atypical
caseating mitral annular calcification but tumor is also part of
the differential). There is no LVOT obstruction. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global hypokinesis suggested. There
is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There
are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with
Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-5-7**], the
degree of TR has increased. RV size has probably increased with
new evidence of volume overload. The apical aneurysm and overal
LVEF are similar (LVEF underestimated on prior report), The LVOT
mass was present but is now more prominent (likely due to
different angulation rather than major changes). If indicated, a
cardiac MRI would be ebst to characterize all of the elements
mentioned above.

CXR [**2108-9-12**]: PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Endotracheal
tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina. Right-sided PICC
terminates in the mid SVC.

Again noted is massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Probable
bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive
atelectasis is
unchanged. There is mild-to-moderate central vascular
engorgement. There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch is noted. Bones
