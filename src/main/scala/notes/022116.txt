Admission Date:  [**2200-4-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-4-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2144-1-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increaesed fatigue.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and
congestive heart failure.  In [**2196**] the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization, which revealed a 90% stenosis in the
RPL and a sequential 80% lesion in distal left anterior
descending coronary artery.  There was also disease of first
and second diagonals.  Subsequently he underwent stenting of
the distal right coronary artery on [**2197-9-28**].  On [**2198-5-14**] he
was catheterized at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 38829**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] Medical Center due to
congestive heart failure, although by report there were no
interventions at that time.  Since then the patient has been
in his usual state of health, but more recently the daughter
reports her father has been very fatigued.  There is no
complaint of chest pain, chest discomfort or shortness of
breath.  Due to the increase in fatigue and loss of exercise
tolerance the patient was referred to a cardiologist and
underwent further testing.

On [**2200-1-31**] the patient underwent echocardiogram, which
demonstrated moderate concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy, mild aortic stenosis, moderate aortic
insufficiency and a mildly dilated aortic root.  There was
also moderate MR and mild tricuspid regurgitation.  He
underwent an exercise stress tolerance test at the same time
with Myoview, which was significant for symptomatic exercise
test, which was stopped due to diaphoresis and pallor.
Imaging revealed a partially reversible inferolateral defect.
An EF was 45%.

The patient denies currently any orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, lightheadedness or peripheral edema.  The
patient presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for
catheterization and likely AVR coronary artery bypass graft
procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Cardiothoracic team.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.  3.  Diabetes mellitus.  4.  Coronary
artery disease status post stenting of right coronary artery.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for status post recent
laser eye surgery and status post tooth extractions.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 375 mg po q.d., Mavic 4 mg
po t.i.d., Glucovance 5/500 mg po b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg po
q.d., Lasix 20 mg o q.o.d., Toprol 200 mg po q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a supportive daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
owns and works at a family grocery store.  Tobacco, the
patient smoked since the age of 14, but quit four years ago
and occasional ETOH use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature is 98.2.
Heart rate 76.  Blood pressure 162/68.  Sating 98% on room
air.  The patient has a supple neck with no bruits.  Lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate
and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, with no masses.  Distal extremity
examination is negative for edema.  Warm bilaterally.

Electrocardiogram significant for normal sinus rhythm with a
rate of 70.  There is inverted T waves in V4 through V6, left
shift of the axis and widened QRS and no evidence of active
ischemia.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.9,
hematocrit 34.8, platelets 146, sodium 138, potassium 4.4,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 21, BUN 24, creatinine 1.5, which
is baseline.  INR of 1.3.

Chest x-ray is significant for slight cardiomegaly with left
ventricular predominance, tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No congestive heart failure.  No infiltrate.  Urinalysis
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient on the day of admission was
admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service.  The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization.  This was significant
for an ejection fraction of 50% with normal wall motion.
Mitral valve showed 1+ regurgitation.  There was 3+ aortic
regurgitation.  Right coronary artery showed 60% stenosis.
Left anterior descending coronary artery showed 80% stenosis.
Proximal circumflex showed 50% stenosis.  Obtuse marginal one
was 60% stenotic.  On hospital day number two the patient was
taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the
Cardiothoracic team where he underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times three and AVR.  The patient received a #23
CarboMedics mechanical valve and the grafts were left
internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to diagonal and
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery.
The patient tolerated this procedure well.  He underwent an
EVJ on the right thigh with hyper skip.

The patient also underwent a Dermabond study.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  The
patient was extubated without incident with good O2
saturation.  The patient was weaned off of all drips.  The
patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 22.  The chest tubes had a total drainage of
600 cc over 24 hours.  The patient's intravascular was
augmented with 500 cc of Hespan.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and in no acute distress.  On
postoperative day number one the patient remained stable and
was transferred to the floor.

On the night of postoperative day number one the patient
developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.  The patient was managed with intravenous
Lopressor.  Rate and blood pressure remained stable in the
130s.  The patient was started on po Amiodarone and rate
became controlled.  The patient spontaneously converted to
sinus rhythm on the morning of postoperative day number two.
The patient's chest tubes and lines were discontinued on
postoperative number two without incident.  The patient's
hematocrit remained stable at 26.  The patient has
occasionally reverted back to atrial fibrillation.  He has
been anticoagulated for his valve and his atrial fibrillation
for a goal of 2.5 to 3.5 on Coumadin.  The patient is
continued on Amiodarone and will be on 400 mg po t.i.d. times
one week and then will switched to 400 b.i.d. times one week
and then 400 q.d. for several months.  The patient's
creatinine had been elevated on postoperative day number two
to a high of 2.0.  The patient's Lasix and potassium had been
stopped and the patient's creatinine has now drifted down to
a baseline of 1.3.  The patient's urine output has remained
adequate.  The patient's diet has been advanced to a diabetic
[**Doctor First Name **] 1800 diet.  The patient is ambulating and is now stable
for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease coronary artery bypass graft
times three.
2.  Aortic insufficiency status post AVR, #23 CarboMedics
mechanical valve.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Amiodarone 400 mg po b.i.d. stop
[**2200-5-2**], Amiodarone 400 mg po t.i.d. start [**2200-5-3**],
Glucovance 5/500 po b.i.d., Lopressor 75 mg po b.i.d.,
