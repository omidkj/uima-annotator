Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 5282**]
Chief Complaint:
Cirrhosis on [**Male First Name (un) **] list s/p aborted trx due to pulmonary
HTN.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization x2
Paracenteses x2
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] is a 41 year-old man, well known to this service,
with history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH + HCV, pulmonary
HTN, severe ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy, now being
transferred from the SICU s/p aborted liver trx due to elevation
in pulmonary pressures to 52/25 (mean 36).
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] was recently admitted from [**2-11**] to [**2147-2-22**] to medicine
service for pancreatitis presumed secondary to gallstones. ERCP
was not performed during that admission as he improved and it
was felt that since he was doing well, the risks outweighed the
benefits. Since d/c, he did well, but did present to ED on [**2-26**]
with abdominal pain and distended abdomen from worsening
ascites. 6L paracentesis was performed and he was given 75 g of
albumin. Of note, creatinine at that visit was 1.8, up from 1.2
from recent discharge. He has been maintained on lasix 20 qd,
aldactone 50 qd. On this admission, his creatinine was noted to
be 2.2, which rose to 2.4, but is now down to 1.8 s/p IVFs.

Past Medical History:
- HCV and EtOH cirrhosis on [**Month/Day (4) **] list
- h/o SBP early [**7-27**] on Cipro prophylaxis
- Grade II esophageal varices
- Recurrent hepatic encephalopathy on vegetarian diet
- Pulmonary HTN
- Hypothyroidism
- Anxiety disorder
- H/o EtOH abuse, IVDU

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year-old man well known to our service, with history of
cirrhosis secondary to EtOH + HCV, pulmonary HTN, severe
ascites, and recurrent encephalopathy, s/p transfer from SICU
post aborted liver trx due to elevation in pulmonary pressures,
then transferred to MICU for diuresis on Lasix gtt. He is now
transferred to back to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name 679**] following 13L fluid removal
for further medical management.
.
# New leukocytosis: Pt with large bump in WBC toward end of
stay, downtrending on day of discharge. Unclear etiology, as has
remained afebrile and clinically feels well. C.Diff negative,
multiple therapeutic taps negative for SBP. No cultures negative
to date.
.
# Elevated PAPm: Repeat right heart cath on [**3-11**] (after
diuresis) showed mean PA pressure of 52 with wedge pressure in
high 20s. Following MICU admission with Swann in place for
diuresis, PAPm is much improved now s/p diuresis on Lasix gtt.
BNP is also improving. His length of stay fluid balance in the
MICU is -13.5L, and his PCWP/PAPm has improved to 15/29 (from
28/52). As PAPm has improved significantly following diuresis
with concomittant improvement in PCWP, it is possible that fluid
overload may be contributing more to elevated PAPm than
pulmonary hypertension.
Off Lasix gtt, negative fluid balance was difficult to obtain,
and pt was placed on increasing doses of IV then eventually PO
diuretics to achieve improved UOP. Increases doses were limited
by rising Cr.  Pt was finally dicharged on Spironolactone 200mg
PO qam, 100mg PO qpm, and Lasix 200mg PO qam, 100mg PO qpm, with
goal I/O negative -1L. Per outpt pulmonologist Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4648**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
resumed home Iloprost while inpatient. Pt is now re-listed on
liver [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] list (pt aware) in setting of improved
pulmonary hypertension.
.
# Cirrhosis: MELD score was previously 34-36, which led to
attempted liver [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Now s/p diuresis for elevated
pulmonary pressure. Cirrhosis has been c/b ascites,
encephalopathy and SBP. No asterixis at present. Pt has had 3
therapeutic [**Doctor First Name 4397**] thus far- [**3-1**] (6L off), [**3-5**] (5L off), [**3-14**]
(6L off), [**3-21**] (~5.5L.), [**3-26**] (~4L). MELD score at discharge
stable at 33.  Pt was continued on Lactulose 30ml PO QID,
Rifaximin 200mg PO TID for hx hepatic encephalopathy. Continue
Ciprofloxacin 250mg PO q24 for SBP prophylaxis. Continue
Ursodiol 600mg PO QAM for elevated bilirubin/pruritis. On Lasix
and Spironolactone. Pt is now re-listed on liver [**Month/Day (4) **] list
(pt aware) as PAPm now improved to <35 (actual 29). Nadolol held
given borderline pressures, re-consider as outpt.
.
# Acute renal failure: This was thought to be secondary to
volume overload +/- HRS at time of transfer from SICU. In MICU,
Cr improved significantly, down to 1.2 from 2 with diuresis,
suggesting improved renal perfusion.  On floor, Cr likely
bumping with diuresis, has been stable between 1.8-2.2.  Pt was
discharged on high doses of Spironolactone/Lasix as above. Also
continue Midodrine 7.6mg PO TID for renal perfusion; holding
Octreotide d/t concern this might further elevate pulmonary
arterial pressures.
.
# Hypothyroid: stable. Last TSH [**2147-12-29**] wnl. Continue outpatient
Synthroid 88mcg PO qday.
.
# Anemia: normocytic; felt to be due primarily to marrow
suppression. S/p transfusion 1U PRBCs [**3-1**], [**3-5**], and [**3-8**]; 2U
PRBCs on [**3-10**]. Pt was guiaic positive on [**3-10**] and [**3-11**], hapto
<20, LDH WNL, retic count 2.4. Patient with h/o diverticulosis
per [**2142**] colonoscopy.
Crit has been stable in mid-20s.
- Trend daily crits
- Consider repeat colonoscopy as outpt
- Transfuse if hct<21 or actively bleeding
.
# Hand/leg cramping: Thought to be related to increasing doses
of diuretics. Magnesium was increased with some benefit. Pain
was controlled with Codeine 15-30mg PO q12 PRN cramping/pain. Pt
was discharged with a limited prescription.
.
# FEN: Pt had previously had a Dobhoff, which clogged [**3-9**], and
was removed [**3-10**]. Now tolerating POs, but per nutrition will not
get adequate intake given liver disease and low
protein/vegetarian diet.  Dobhoff replaced again [**3-21**], as pt
inadvertantly had it pulled out. Additionally, pt accidentally
pulled Dobhoff out 10inches toward end of stay while sleeping.
Replaced by GI fellow, with bridle now in place. Likely not
post-pyloric but adequate. On fluid restriction 1200ml d/t
concern of volume overload. On Mag, Zinc, Vit D.
