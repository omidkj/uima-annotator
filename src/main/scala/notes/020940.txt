Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 yo female with minimal PMH who presents with
acute onset dyspnea. She injured her left ankle stepping in a
pothole about two weeks ago and subsequently developed left calf
cramping which she attributed to her injury. This continued
until today, when she got up from a chair and noticed acute
onset dyspnea. Her calf pain stopped right about the same time.
She noticed chest discomfort and lightheadedness at that time.
She went to an OSH where a CTA was positive for a large saddle
embolus. She was given 90mg of lovenox and sent to [**Hospital1 **].

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 122 149/105 22 100%4L. She
remained tachycardic but o/w HD stable and satting in the upper
90s on RA. She received 1500cc NS. A bedside echo showed
moderate RV dilation and mild pulm HTN. She was admitted to the
MICU for monitoring.

On the floor, she is comfortable and pleasant with no current
complaints.

CTA chest from outside hospital:
Extensive filling defect within the pulmonary arterial tree with
saddle embolus at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery.
There is PE extending into nearly every lobar segment. There is
apparent flattening of interventricular septum which could
reflect right heart strain. No pathologically enlarged node is
noted. No pericardial effusion is visualized. No pleural
effusion is noted.
Linear atelectatic changes of the lingula and right middle lobe
noted. There is no evidence of infarct. No worrisome nodules.
The visualized part of the upper abdomen including adrenal
glands, kidneys and spleen appear unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with possible
right heart
strain.

Echo: [**7-9**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricular cavity with basal right
ventricular hypokinesis and right ventricular pressure and
volume overload consistent with right ventricular strain in the
setting of pulmonary emboli.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 46 yo female with no PMH who presents with
DVT/PE in the setting of OCPs and left ankle injury.

DVT/PE: Presented with submassive pulmonary embolism with
evidence of right heart strain on CT and ECHO.  Known risk
factors include recent left ankle injury with immobilization and
longterm OCP use. Age-appropriate cancer screening is up- to-
date and no family hx to suggest prothrombotic state. Large clot
burden with some evidence of RH strain but HD stable. No
absolute indication to lyse.

Given lovenox at the OSH prior to transfer and continued
throughout hospitalization.  OCP was discontinued given
thrombogenic potential.  Monitored on telemetry for first 24hrs
of hospital stay with no evidence of arrhythmia.  Patient
elected for long term treatment with lovenox instead of
transitioning to oral anticoagulation given frequent travel for
work.  Started on vitamin D and calcium given risks of
osteoporosis with LMWH.  She will follow up with hematology to
determine whether she needs a more thorough evaluation for
thrombophilia.  Patient will need at least 3 mths of
anticoagulation.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] with a large pulmonary
embolism, or blood clot in your lungs.  You were treated with a
blood thinner called lovenox, that you will need to take twice
daily for the next 3 to 6 months.  Of note, this medication can
cause some thinning of the blood, which can cause easy
bruising/bleeding.

We have made the following changes to your medication regimen:
- BEGIN TAKING Lovenox SC injections twice daily
- BEGIN TAKING calcium supplements
- BEGIN TAKING vitamin D supplements

Please take your medications as prescribed and follow up as
suggested below. If you cannot make these appointment times,
please call to reschedule. In addition, because many medications
may interact with Lovenox and increase the risk of bleeding,
please check with your doctor before taking over-the-counter
medication or herbal supplements.
