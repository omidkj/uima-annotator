Admission Date:  [**2195-8-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-8-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2130-4-10**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Company 191**]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
woman with multiple medical problems including coronary
artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2171**], breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and chemotherapy
and radiation therapy, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in
splenectomy, portal vein thrombosis, and known grade III
esophageal varices who presents now with a 3-day history of
black tarry stools and nausea times one day.

The patient denies bright red blood per rectum.  Denies
vomiting or hematemesis.  She was noted to be more lethargic
by her family on the night prior to admission and was taken
was noted to have a blood pressure of 156/75, and an
electrocardiogram that showed rapid atrial fibrillation to
the 160s, and inferolateral ST depressions.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further management.  In the Emergency Room she was found
to be in sinus tachycardia with a rate of 102 and blood
pressure 122/61.  The patient complained of right-sided chest
pain which resolved one sublingual nitroglycerin.  The
patient also was complaining of nausea.  Electrocardiogram
showed persistent inferolateral ST changes.  Nasogastric
lavage was done which revealed small specs of blood clots,
but no active bleeding.  Hematocrit was 19.9.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for observation overnight.  The [**Hospital 228**] Medical
Intensive Care Unit course was notable for a transfusion of 4
units of packed red blood cells with appropriate bump in
hematocrit to 30.  The patient was placed on Protonix,
propranolol, and Octreotide drip.  The patient also ruled in
for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a peak creatine
kinase of 863 which then trended downward and with slow
resolution of electrocardiogram changes.  The patient's
atrial fibrillation spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm.
The patient did have one episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia in the post myocardial infarction period.  The
patient's esophagogastroduodenoscopy was delayed in the
setting of her non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.  Cardiology
deferred catheterization in the setting of gastrointestinal
bleed.

The patient was transferred to the Medical floor for further
management.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denied
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath.  The
patient did continue feeling lightheaded when going from
lying to sitting.  The patient did have mild right upper
quadrant tenderness, but no rebound or guarding.  She
reported continued black stools, but no dysuria and no chest
pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2171**].  Status post exercise MIBI in [**2194-9-14**]; a 9-minute [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, 62% maximum heart rate,
no anginal type symptoms with possible ischemic
electrocardiogram changes (0.5-mm to 1-mm  ST depressions in

ejection fraction of 47%, and mild reversible perfusion
defect in the inferior wall and apex, and mild global
hypokinesis.
 2.  Hypercholesterolemia.

hypercalcemia treated with steroids.
 7.  Diastolic dysfunction.
 8.  Admitted for dyspnea on exertion in [**2194-9-14**].
 9.  Status post transthoracic echocardiogram which showed
mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy,
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of
greater than 55%.  No regional wall motion abnormalities.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
10.  Portal vein thrombosis in [**2188**] treated initially with
Coumadin.
11.  Osteoporosis.
12.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2189**].
13.  Esophageal varices presumed secondary to portal vein
thrombosis, status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2194-9-14**] showing grade III varices in middle and lower third
of the esophagus which were nonbleeding.
14.  Helicobacter pylori negative in [**2194-9-14**].
15.  A 3.8-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm incidentally noted
on CAT scan from [**2194-9-14**].
16.  Status post Escherichia coli sepsis in [**2194-8-15**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Home medications include)
1.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Propranolol 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Octreotide drip 50 mcg per hour.
3.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient allergic to ERYTHROMYCIN and
CEFTAZIDIME; the patient gets thrombocytopenic with
CEFTAZIDIME.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband.  The
patient has four sons.  She quit smoking eight years ago and
drinks alcohol socially.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Both father and mother died from heart
problems.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.5, blood
pressure 114 to 133/51 to 63, respirations 18, satting 99% on
2 liters.  In general, the patient was pleasant, slightly
tired, but alert and oriented times three.  HEENT revealed
oropharynx was slightly dry.  Neck had jugular venous
distention to 8 cm.  Cardiovascular had a regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Respiratory with
crackles heard halfway up on the right and at the base on the
left.  No wheezing.  Abdomen was soft with moderate
distention, mild right upper quadrant tenderness.  No
hepatomegaly.  Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  Right femoral line in place.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with
slight left ventricular decompensation.

Abdominal ultrasound showed portal vein thrombosis with
diffuse increase of hepatic echogenicity compared to the
study done on [**2194-9-17**].

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with normal
intervals, normal axis, Q wave in III, poor R wave
progression, ST depressions in V5 and V6; ischemic changes
improved from previous electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient received Octreotide drip
for 72 hours, continued on Protonix and propranolol.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable at 30 and did not
require any further transfusions.

Upper endoscopy revealed multiple grade III varices in the
middle and distal third of the esophagus.  Three bands were
placed.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient ruled in for a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a peak creatine kinase
of 863.  Her creatine kinases began to trend down, and her
electrocardiogram changes resolved.  This was likely
secondary to demand ischemia from her gastrointestinal bleed.
Aspirin was held secondary to her gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient was on propranolol and started on an ACE
inhibitor.  Her Lipitor was continued.

Cardiac catheterization will eventually have to be done as an
outpatient.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient's post myocardial
infarction echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45%
and 4+ mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.  The
patient was diuresed with Lasix p.r.n.   The patient will
need to receive a follow-up echocardiogram in two to three
months to evaluate her congestive heart failure status and to
evaluate the need for valve repair, as echo revealed 4+ MR.

4.  ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  The patient's atrial fibrillation
from outside hospital spontaneously converted to normal sinus
rhythm.  The patient had one episode of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia within the post myocardial infarction
24-hour period.  The patient's only other telemetry events
was a brief episode of atrial tachycardia.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's INR was elevated, and the
patient was treated with vitamin K.  Hypercoagulability
workup was
