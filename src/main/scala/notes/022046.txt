CXR [**2111-2-4**]:
Evaluation is limited by the position of the
head over the upper chest and low lung volumes. Again noted is
increased
opacification at the left lung base, most likely atelectasis and
increased
pleural effusion, although underlying infection is not excluded.
There is
slight upper lobe redistribution, particularly on the left, with
hilar
fullness, but there is no overt pulmonary edema. The heart size
is not
significantly changed allowing for differences in technique. Two
pacer leads follow a normal course from the right-sided battery
pack terminating in the expected position of the right atrium
and ventricle. Degenerative change of the bilateral glenohumeral
joints is noted with unchanged inferior displacement of the
right shoulder.
IMPRESSION: Slight interval increase in left pleural effusion
and basilar
atelectasis. Cardiomegaly and probable mild failure, but no
overt pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 75F [**Name (NI) **] pt with hx of bilateral PE's, AF, COPD,
Non-Obstructive CAD and Dementia, presenting with hypoxemia.
.
# Hypoxemia: Pt on baseline 3L at [**Name (NI) **], presented to the MICU on
3L. ED ABG with p02 of 62, pCO2 of 64 indicative of A-a
gradient. No clear evidence of infiltrate on CXR, although could
not exclude retrocardiac opacity as source of infection. Pt now
at baseline 02 requirement. Unclear precipitating events for
transient hypoxia (COPD excerbation resolving with steroids,
atelectasis, fluid overload, PE). Pt now at baseline without
appreciable wheezes on exam. No increase in sputum production
from baseline. No reported fevers of chills. The patient was
continued on 3L 02. The pt was discharged with 4 additional days
of PO cefpodoxime to treat presumed bronchitis.
.
# Hypercarbia: Pt with PFTs suggestive of COPD (FVC 0.96, FEV1
0.47, ratio of 49, 71% predicted), however pt with tachypnea,
wheezing. ?increase in productive cough. Pt with hx of pCO2
50-70s. Currently breathing comfortably and mentating likely
close to baseline. HCo3 of 39 is at patients approximate
baseline.
.
# Fluid Status: Pt with initial Hct of 38 (baseline approx 30),
in setting of increase BUN and slightly increased [**Name (NI) **] pt that was
suggestive of intravascularly depletion, however her fluid
status is difficult to assess given crackles on physical exam
and suggestion of mild fluid overload on CXR. The patient was
felt to be close to euvolemia and thus was not diuresed during
her hospital course.
.
# UTI: Pt positive urine cx >100K GNR. Per [**Name (NI) **] records the pt
was part way through a course of PO macrobid, given the patients
pulmonary symptoms, the patient was started on PO Cefpodoxime to
cover both urinary and pulmonary potential organisms.
.
#. Mental Status: Non-focal neuro exam. Baseline reported to be
AOx1-2. Patient currently calm. Unclear if patient altered from
baseline. The patients daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] and per report her
mental status exam was at baseline at the time of discharge.
.
# DM II:ISS while in house
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled on Metoprolol
and Diltiazem. INR was supratherapeutic without signs of
bleeding. The ICU team anticipate jump in INR given pt received
Levaquin, and thus the patients Coumadin was held. The patient
was discharged on her home dosing of Metoprolol and Diltiazem.
.
The patients INR was 2.7 on discharge. Given that she will
remain on cefpodoxime for 4 additional days the plan will be as
following:
Fri [**2-6**]: Cefpodoxime , No Coumadin
Sat [**2-7**]: Cefpodoxime , No Coumadin
Sun [**2-8**]: Cefpodoxime , 0.5mg Coumadin
Mon [**2-9**]: Cefpodoxime , 0.5mg Coumadin, INR Check
Tue [**2-10**]: Cefpodoxime , Coumadin per INR
