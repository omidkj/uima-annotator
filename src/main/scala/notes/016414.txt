ADDENDUM:  The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2201-2-26**], at which time he completed his course of
antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and Flagyl on [**2201-3-1**].  During admission on the floor, the patient also had a
slowly progressive anemia, probably secondary to his
myelodysplastic syndrome.  The patient was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit of
greater than 28 given his history of coronary artery disease.
 The patient had an appropriate response to the transfusion
and his hematocrit remained stable times three days at the
time of discharge.  There was no evidence of any active
bleeding.

Additionally, a gastrojejunostomy tube was placed given the
patient's history of chronic aspiration pneumonia and the
need for tube feeding.  On [**2201-3-3**], a gastrojejunostomy
tube was placed successfully and tube feedings were started
immediately without incident.
