Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure and unresponsiveness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubated (intubated at OSH)
LP
Pacemaker placed [**2-22**]

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an obese 67 yo man with complicated PMH including
HTN, hypercholesterolemia, ongoing EtOH abuse and hx of neck
hematoma, C7 fracture from MVA in [**3-22**] transferred from [**Hospital3 6265**] after being found unresponsive.

Hx if limited given no family members and unable to reach
friend/neighbor.  [**Name (NI) **] medical records, patient was last seen
normal 2 days ago then was found "sleeping" in the chair
yesterday per neighbor/friend who thought that he was just
sleeping.  However, the friend found him in same position today
hence called 911.  EMS reports that his FSBG was 203 and was
found unresponsive but moving his L side intermittently.  Either
en route or while at [**Hospital1 **], had repeated generalized seizure
which did not abate with Ativan 2mg IV hence given Valium 10mg
which stopped the seizure.  He was then loaded with 2g of
fosphenytoin then intubated for airway protection.  CT
reportedly
negative for acute pathology and LP was unsuccessful hence
started on Vanc/Acyclovir/Rocephin prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Reportedly EtOH level 0 at [**Hospital3 3583**].

Here, patient is febrile to 101.8. Given hx of EtOH abuse,
patient started on banana bag.

[**2-19**] Abd U/S:
1. Diffuse increased echogenicity of the liver is likely related
to fatty
infiltration. However, other forms of liver disease including
fibrosis and
cirrhosis are not excluded. Please clinically correlate.
2. Ascites and splenomegaly, suggestive of portal hypertension.
However, the main portal vein does demonstrate hepatopetal flow.


[**2-18**] Hand XRay:
1. Degenerative changes as described above.
2. Soft tissue swelling adjacent to interphalangeal joint of the
left thumb in addition to a possible juxta articular erosion.
Given soft tissue swelling and possible erosion, gout should be
considered.

Imaging:
EEG [**2179-2-14**]:
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine
sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background
with low
voltage. This is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
There was
also prominent left hemispheric slowing. There were no
electrographic
seizures or epileptiform discharges noted on this recording.

MR head w/w/o gado: [**2179-2-14**]
There is no evidence of intracranial mass. There is a focal area

of hyperintensity in the left posterior thalamus on the FLAIR
images. This
area is hyperintense on the diffusion-weighted images and
faintly hypointense
on the diffusion coefficient maps. This most likely represents a
small area of infarction. There is no abnormal enhancement after
contrast
administration. Images of the remainder of the brain are
somewhat degraded by susceptibility artifacts at the skull base.
However, no other abnormalities are detected.

CONCLUSION: Probable subacute left posterior thalamic
infarction. No other
significant abnormalities are detected.

EKG [**2179-2-13**]:
Atrial fibrillation is now present. The QRS complex is still an
intraventricular conduction defect with right bundle-branch
block morphology and diffuse T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing of [**2179-2-11**] the QRS complex is more narrow. The
axis remains leftward with an intraventricular  conduction delay
that is more right bundle-branch block. Diffuse T wave changes
and ST segment changes are still present.

Hip/pelvis:
The film is somewhat underpenetrated. There is evidence of a
right total hip
replacement in a satisfactory position. No fracture is
identified, though the
upper portions of the pelvis are not adequately seen.


LENIS [**2178-2-13**];
1. No DVT of either lower extremity. Please note, however,
left-sided calf
veins are not visualized.
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema bilaterally.

CTA neck/head [**2178-2-13**];

1. Approximately 50-55% stenosis at the origin of the left
internal carotid
artery by NASCET criteria.

2. Technically limited study demonstrating patent intracranial
arterial
vasculature without evidence of aneurysm or high-grade stenosis.


3. No acute hemorrhage or infarction.
