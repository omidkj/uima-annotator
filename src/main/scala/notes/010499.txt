Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2124-9-4**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR well
seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
Physiologic TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
The rhythm appears to be A-V paced. Results were personally
Conclusions
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35%). A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. The right ventricle is not well [**Doctor First Name **] but its
function is probably normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-9-4**]
there is now global left ventricular systolic dysfunction which
is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
As a same day admit she went to the Operating Room where the
aortic valve was replaced and the ascending aorta replaced using
a 23mm ON-X valve and a 28mm gelweave graft. The peicardium was
closed with Cor-matrix as well.  She weaned from bypass on Neo
Synephrine in stable condition.  She weaned from the ventilator
and pressor support easily.  Chest tubes and temporary pacing
wires were removed per protocol.  Coumadin was started for the
mechanical valve and Heparin on POD 3.
Heaprain was stopped on POD#6 when her INR was therapeutic at
2.5 and was given 5mg of coumadin.

She developed a junctional rhythm in the 70s postoperatively and
Electrophysiology was consulted. She converted to sinus rhythm
subsequently.  She was aggresively diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. Physical Therapy worked with her for
strength and mobility.

On POD #6 she was cleared for discharge to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
[**Last Name (un) 17679**]. Appropriate follow up instructions, medications and
appointments were given.
