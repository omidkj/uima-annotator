History of Present Illness:
84 y.o. man with multiple medical problems admitted to ICU for
pneumonia, respiratory failure and septic shock.  History is per
daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] daughter, he has been feeling weak over the last
10 days or so.  On Monday, he sufferred a GTC seizure which he
has not had in a few years.  He came to ED here at [**Hospital1 18**], and
was evaluated.  Workup at the time showed no abnormality though
CXR showed possible infiltrate.  Pt was discharged back home
where he has 24 hour caretakers.  [**Name (NI) **] continued to feel weak, but
had no other focal complaints.  Per daughter, he was not
complaining of SOB, CP, cough, fever.  Last night, he felt cold.
 This continued until today, when he felt cold to the touch and
a temperature taken showed T=32 Celsius.  He was brought to the
ED.  Here he was found to be hypotensive to SBP in 80s and 90s.
He did not have significant response to fluid bolus (? 2L ).  A
central line was placed and he was started on dopamine and
levophed.  CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate so he was treated for
pneumonia with ceftriaxone, vancomycine, levaquin and flagyl.
Due to hypoxia (78% RA, 91% on NRB), he was intubated.  He was
then transferred up to MICU for further management.  He received
a total of 5.3 L NS in ED.

1) Deafness
2) Hypothyroidism
3) Diastolic dysfunction

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. No LV mass/thrombus. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. Mild AS. Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Normal tricuspid
valve supporting structures. Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF 6070%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion
are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review)
of [**2141-1-9**], mild aortic stenosis is now present; the
aortic, mitral,
and tricuspid regurgitation are all increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y.o. man with h/o hypothyroidism, pneumonia, seizures,
diastolic CHF who presents with hypothermia, hypoxia, and
hypotension.  CXR revealed pneumonia, and hypothermia and
hypotension consistent with septic shock from pneumonia.
Etiology of pneumonia unclear--may have been secondary to
aspiration event from seizure, but more likely preceeded seizure
given his generalized weakness.
..
..
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar
pneumonia.  Initial ABG was 7.17/64/106 suggesting respiratory
acidosis from hypoventilation.  Pt was intubated and remained on
venilator for 2 wks. He was extubated on [**2142-11-21**]. He remained off
the ventlator for 1 wk but was re-intubated secondary to hypoxia
and hypercarbia. He remained intubated for 1 wk. After
discussion with fa
