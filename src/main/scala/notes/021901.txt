History of Present Illness:
32 year old female with no past medical history presented to an
outside hospital seven days prior to transfer with a two day
history of sore throat, progressive and productive cough,
pleuritic chest pain, myalgias, shortness of breath, nausea,
bilious and non-bloody vomiting, and fever to 103.1. She has not
had any sick contacts, although her husband developed strep
throat after the patient was already admitted in the hospital
and was strated on antibiotics.
She initially presented to the ED where she had a CXR which
showed a right upper lobe pneumonia. WBC was 10. She was
discharged home on Levaquin. At home, she continued to feel
unwell with vomiting and myalgias. Later that day, she had a
syncopal episode witnessed by her husband. The patient went to
the bathroom with diarrhea. After BM, she called her husband
saying that she feels dizzy. She then passed out. LOC x one
minute. No bowel/baldder incontinence. No confusion. She
returned to the ED later that evening and was found to have a
blood pressure of 74/52 and hypokalemic with a potassium of 2.9.
She was fluid resuscitated, potassium repleted and given
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and Vancomycin. The patient was
found to be hypoxemic, ABG 7.43/28/68 and underwent CTA which
was negative for PE, but which demonstrated right upper lobe and
right lower lobe pneumonia. Incidentally, a left upper lobe
nodule and borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy were found and
transferred to the ICU. The patient continued to deteriorate,
developed respiratory distress and was intubated on [**2107-6-7**]. ID
was consulted. They recommended to change Abx to Vanco, Levo,
Clindamycin. Thoracentesis performed [**6-9**] showed WBC 4443, RBC
570, poly 80%, mono 20%, glucose 85, LDH 934, TP <2.5.

Brief Hospital Course:
32 yo woman transferred from OSH where she was found to have
worsening PNA, requiring intubation. The following issues were
investigated during this hospitalization:

# Multifocal pneumonia: Pt was intubated and ventilated on AC on
transfer to ICU on [**2107-6-10**]. Antibiotic regimen was changed to
Zosyn, Vancomycin and Clindamycin, the latter of which was added
to decrease toxin production. Additionally, blood, urine,
Legionella, sputum, and BAL samples were collected for cultures.
She was successfully extubated on [**2107-6-11**]. Culture data was all
negative except a sputum culture which showed 1+ GPCs in pairs.
The leading differential was bacterial PNA, specifically
Streptococcus Pneumoniae. Interestingly, the patient's husband
and child were recently diagnosed with strep throat, although
this would be a different streptococcal strain. All other
possibilities seemed less likely given extensive work-up, though
the severity of the patient's PNA, necessitating intubation, was
concerning. As a result, broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin
and Zosyn) were continued via PICC on discharge for a total of 2
weeks (both during and after hospitalization). The patient
remained afebrile with adequate oxygenation for the rest of her
hospitalization.
.
# Hydronephrosis: Patient had an abdominal U/S at the outside
hospital with demonstrated mild hydronephrosis of the L kidney.
This was reevaluated here with a renal US which showed no
hydronephrosis. Patient also denied urinary symptoms. No further
investigation was pursued.
