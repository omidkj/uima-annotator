Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ placed
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80F with a history of severe AS, CAD, s/p nephrectomy
for RCC with ESRD recently started on HD and recent admission to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cough [**Date range (1) 135**] p/w cough. Today she woke up from
sleep with acute shortness of breath and cough. NO Chest pain.
Husband called 911. In the ER, afebrile HR 120s, SBP 110s. CXR
with ? PNA. She was given ceftriaxone 1 gram and levofloxacin
750mg IV X1. Given continued resp distress intubated (rocuronium
and etomidate).
On presentation to the CCU pt intubated unable to provide
history. Per husbandpt has had a severe cough since discharge
from hosp productive for clear sputum. Overall has had a cough
for ~3 mos (had been treated for PNA X2 most recently [**2174-5-15**]).
She saw her cardiologist and who stopped her ramipril and
switched her to losartan 1 day PTA. She has not had any fevers,
nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note she had aoritc
valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-10**] (initially valve area 0.56cm2, gradient
27 -> after the procedure the calculated aortic valve area was
0.74 cm2 and gradient 12 mmHg.) Pt has been on dialysis in the
past but with improvement in creatinine she was not dialysed on
Thursday (last dialysis [**2174-5-24**]).


Past Medical History:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2171**] anatomy as follows:
-- LMCA clean
-- LAD: mild disease
-- LCX: mild disease with origin OM1 and OM2 60-70% stenosis
-- RCA: ulcerated 50% proximal plaque w/ mild disease
-- severe AS: [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 cm2, peak gradient 50

.
Other Past History:

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**4-/2174**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2174-5-20**] demonstrated:The left
atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

EKG on admission-Sinus tachycardia with left bundle-branch block
with secondary ST-T wave
abnormalities. No diagnostic change from tracing #1.
.
[**Month/Day/Year **] on admission - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments
(LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small, primarily anterior (?loculated)
pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise
with a prominent anterior fat pad.
.
[**6-6**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left
bundle-branch block.
Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.
