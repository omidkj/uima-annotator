Allergies:
Lipitor / Codeine / Procardia / Iodine / Pepcid / Catapres

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI - being transferred for cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
87 yo female with history of hypertension who presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with chest pain for 2 days and found to have a NSTEMI
as per cardiac enzymes. Peak Trop I was 0.96 although CKs have
remained flat as per outside hospital. Patient continued to have
episodes of chest pain that were being treated with SL NTG with
improvement. Denies any other associated symptoms including
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis. However, did note that the pain
radiated to both of her arms. Patient went into mild heart
failure yesterday after getting IVF but seems to be improving
with IV Lasix. Was seen by Cardiology this morning, and was
started on Lipitor, Heparin gtt and Integrillin gtt and
requested to be transferred here for cath. She refused Lipitor
because she is allergic to it. Being transferred here for cath
and further management.

Reason: please assess interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
87 year old woman with NSTEMI, new onset shortness of breath now
s/p diuresis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please assess interval change
INDICATION: 87-year-old with congestive heart failure.

Portable upright frontal radiograph. Comparison is made to one
day earlier and study performed 6 hours earlier.

FINDINGS:
Compared to the study of 6 hours earlier, there has been an
improvement in the congestive heart failure pattern with
decreased upper zone redistribution. There is stable
cardiomegaly. Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant, likely
from prior cholecystectomy. The aorta is calcified, and
calcifications are also seen in the splenic artery.

IMPRESSION:
Improving congestive heart failure.

1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary artery
had a 20%
stenosis.  The LAD had a 90% stenosis at the origin.  The LCX
had a 60%
stenosis of the OM1.  The RCA was totally occluded.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided
filling
pressures (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 10 mm Hg).

Pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated (PA pressure was
47/18
mm Hg).  Left sided filling pressures were moderately elevated
(mean PCW
pressure was 21 mm Hg).  Central arterial pressure was mildy
elevated
(aortic pressure was 150/63 mm Hg).  Cardiac index was low (at
2.2
L/min/m2).
3. Successful PTCA/stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0x13mm
Cypher
DES. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
dissection and
TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. PCI of the LAD.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is
seen in the RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Severely depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired
relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely
depressed. Anterior, septal, apical, distal inferior, and distal
lateral
severe hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
mitral
regurgitation is present.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. There is a small pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
# CHF - The arrived slightly fluid overloaded then had flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension and fluid
administration on the floor. She was transferred to the ICU for
[**Last Name (un) 62089**] monitoring but did not require intubation. Her echo showed
an EF of less than 30%, 2+ MR, overall left ventricular systolic
function was severely
depressed. Anterior, septal, apical, distal inferior, and distal
lateral
severe hypokinesis to akinesis was present.  She diuresed well
and became euvolemic with a base weight of 49.8kg. She will be
discharged on only Lasix 20mg.
.
# CAD- The patient was transferred here from [**Hospital1 **] for an
NSTEMI. Her cath showed 20% LMCA, 90% LAD which was stented, and
a 60% OM1 lesion. Her RCA was totally occluded.  Her peak
troponin 1.07 and peak CK of 354. She was continued on a ASA
B-blocker, and ACEi.  She was given Crestor because she said she
was allergic to Lipitor and tolerated this well. If her diarrhea
persists, consider stopping Crestor. She should remain on Plavix
for at least 6-9 months.
.
# LBBB. AV paced.  The paitent had a 16 beat run of VT on the
tele monitor here. She was asymotpaitc. She should be evaulated
by her cardiologist for a Biv/ICD pacer if nnecessary.
.
# Acute renal failure- The patient had an increase in her Cr
here thought to be due to contrast. Peak was 1.5 and began to
decrease before discharge. Recheck in [**2-10**] weeks.
.
# Anemia and thrombocytosis: She takes hydrea for essential
thrombocytosis. Also takes procrit as outpt to counteract
hydrea.  Initially her Plavix was doubles to 150 since she has
thrombocytosis, but then she had an episode of blood-streaked
stool therefore her Plavix was reduced to 75. Her HCT decreased
to 26 ans she was transfused 1 unit to a HCT of 32
