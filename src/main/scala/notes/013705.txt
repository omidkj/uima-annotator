Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro-patient is in a persistent vegetative state and remained
unresponsive and at his baseline throughout his hospital stay.

Cardiovascular-patient was weaned off of pressor support shortly
after admission, he was maintained on iv metoprolol with
adequate control of his blood pressure.  However, the pt. does
not tolerate being turned on his right side - his pressures will
decrease somewhat.  If this occurs - place pt. back to supine
position and blood pressure should correct.

Respiratory-patient was intubated on admission. A series of
discussions were had with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, his
daughter, regarding the need for tracheostomy. Both the primary
general surgery team and the thoracic team were consulted
regarding the need for tracheostomy. Eventually, a second
opinion was requested by the daughter and obtained from general
surgery. The daughter was told that the patient would likely
benefit from tracheostomy and that extubation could very well
lead to reintubation considering the patient's poor functional
status. The daughter decided to attempt extubation, the pt. was
extubated and has been doing very well for the past several days
off of the vent.  He has been maintaining O2 saturations in the
high 90s with minimal oxygen from the face tent.

GI-the patient was started on TPN for nutritional support. He
was also given tube feedings. He is currently being maintained
on tube feeds and no TPN.  His albumin has been stable with this
regimen and he should be continued on this: Nepro 45% strength
for Osm of 280 at a goal rate of 70cc/hour.

GU-Pt. has been getting Lasix throughout his stay for help
w/diuresis.  He was initially quite volume overloaded and need
this to get fluid off so he could be extubated.  He is no longer
requiring lasix and is making adequate uring on his own.  His
renal function has also returned to [**Location 213**].

[**Name (NI) **] The pt. received a few transfusions of PRBCs during his
and for the past week his hematocrit has been stable.  We do not
anticipate that he will need any further transfusions.

[**Name (NI) **] Pt. was initially being treated for aspiration pneumonia and
is requiring two more day of antibiotics to complete his course.
 His WBCs have been stable.
