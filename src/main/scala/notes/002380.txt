Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia
and hypertension that lives alone in [**Hospital3 4634**] and is said
to be awake, alert and oriented.  She was ambulating to the
bathroom this am when she felt acutely dizzy. She collapsed to
the ground where she was unsure if she lost consciousness. She
dragged herself to the bathroom but noted onset of sub-sternal
chest pressure, nausea, shortness of breath, and bilateral arm
numbness. She called help using the pull cords and 911 was
called. She was brought to the ED and was found to be very cold.
 An EKG revealed the patient to have ST elevations in the
inferolateral leads.  She also dropped her heart rate to the
30's and is said to be in complete heart block.  She is
currently being 100% paced with external pacer pads to a HR of
60.  Her blood pressure dropped to the 40's systolic.  She was
given a total of 2 doses of atropine and a 300 cc saline bolus
as well and with the pacer pads is now in the low 80's systolic.
 She is on a 100% non-rebreather but sats can't be obtained due
to cold temperatue.   Her rectal temp was 97.  She was given ASA
81 mg x 4, Plavix 600 mg, Liptor 80 mg and Morphine 2 mg for
chest pain after the pacer pads were placed.  She will be
accompanied by her daughter-in-law.
.
In OSH ED, hypotensive in 3rd degree AV block, SBPs to 60s.  EKG
showed ST elevations in inferior leads with reciprocal changes
in V2, aVL, early repolarization in lateral leads.  External
pacers placed and pt. transferred here for cath.
.
In cath lab, LAD mid 60% stenosis, L circ 70% at origin, mid RCA
99%, RCA stented with BMS.  Currently denies discomfort but
notes mild shortness of breath.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

CXR:
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The
aortic knob is calcified. Mild increase in interstitial markings
indicate mild interstitial fluid overload. There is no focal
consolidation or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial fluid overload.

Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD was
diffusely
diseased with a mid vessel 60% lesion.  The LCX had a 70% origin

stenosis.  The RCA had a mid vessel 99% lesion.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 18 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 17 mm Hg.
There was
mild pulmonary arterial hypertension of 32/19 mm Hg.  There was
systemic
arterial hypotension at 98/44 mm Hg.  The cardiac index was
preserved at
3.5 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful stenting of the mid RCa with a 2.5 X 12 mm Vision
bare
metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for
detail).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with a bare metal stent.
4. Successful treatment of STE IMI with primary PTCA.

TTE:
The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
inferior hypokinesis/akinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50 %). The estimated cardiac index is
borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with focal basal free wall hypokinesis. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Inferior wall hypokinesis/akinesis consistent with
myocardial infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
CAD/Ischemia: The patient suffered an inferior STEMI with
culprit lesion found in the RCA s/p bare metal stent. Her
initial course was complicated by hypotension and bradycardia
requiring dopamine and external pacing. However, both of these
resolved quickly after stenting and resolution of coronary flow.
She was begun on metoprolol, lisinopril, ASA, Plavix, and
atorvastatin. Her lipid panel did show both an elevated total
cholesterol and an elevated LDL. Her HbA1c was normal at 5.4%.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as her new cardiologist.

Pump: Initially the patient showed signs of volume overload with
pulmonary edema. She initially recieved IV lasix for diuresis
and was maintained on a stable regimen of 20mg PO lasix. An
echocardiogram showed an EF of 50% with inferior hypokinesis and
1+MR/AI.  She was begun on metoprolol and lisinopril with good
effect.

Rhythm: The patient was initially bradycardiac with a high
degree of AV block. However, this resolved after coronary
intervention. She remained in normal sinus rhythm for the rest
of her hospitalization. She was begun
