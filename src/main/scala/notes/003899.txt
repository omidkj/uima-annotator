Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 49761**] is an 87 y/o female with a history of CHF, afib, pulm
htn [**3-7**] COPD who was transferred from BIDN for respiratory
distress likely from a pneumonia. She was noted to be short of
breath at her nursing facility the day PTA and was found to have
an O2 sat of 80% on RA and was put on 2L of 02 which brought her
up to 88%. The following day she destated again with an O2 sat
of 70% on 2L with worening tachypnea and tachycardia. She was
sent to BIDN where she was noted to have a fever of 103 and a
CXR with RLL infiltrate worse than previous concerning for
pneumonia. Her blood gas was 7.44/58/62/She was given
Ceftriaxone, Levaquin and dexamethasone and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for ICU admission.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.9 104 104/62 20 92% 8L venti
mask. She was noted to be mentating well with crackles noted
bilaterally and decreaed breath sounds on the right side. Vital
Signs Upon Transfer were: Temp: 97.4 ??????F (36.3 ??????C) (Oral), Pulse:
94, RR: 29, BP: 108/44, O2Sat: 94%, O2Flow: 8L (Mask).
.
On arrival to the MICU, she appeared comfortble and in NAD. She
was speaking in full sentences and not using any accessory
muscle use. She was a venti mask sating 95%.
.
While in MICU [**Location (un) **], the patient did well.  She was started on
vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin to treat for HCAP.
Solumedrol was discontinued as this was not thought to be
secondary to a COPD exarbaction.  Given where she lives, the
decision was made to treat for CAP instead of HCAP so vancomycin
and cefepime were discontinued on [**4-28**].  The patient was weaned
down to 2L NC with saturations maintained in the mid-90s with no
shortness of breath.  BPs were initially low so home Bumex was
held but they improved today so the medication was resumed.  She
is being transferred to the medicine floor for further
management
.
On arrival to the floor, vital signs were T: 97.7, BP- 108/55,
HR- 60, RR- 20, SaO2- 96% on 2L.  The patient denies fevers,
chills, chest pain or shortness of breath and reports feeling
better.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2120-4-28**]**

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2120-4-28**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

Blood cultures ([**2120-4-27**]): pending at discharge
Urine culture- no growth
Urine legionella- negative
Sputum culture- contaminant

Imaging CXR PA/Lateral [**4-27**]:
AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no
prior studies available for comparison.

Heart size is enlarged. Bilateral prominence of pulmonary
arteries is most
likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension, although some
degree of
lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded. Coronary and aortic valve
calcifications are noted.

Patient is in interstitial pulmonary edema associated with
bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
Re-evaluation of the patient is recommended to assess the hila
for the presence of lymphadenopathy versus enlarged pulmonary
arteries.

Chest x-ray ([**2120-4-28**])
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-27**], there is little
interval
change. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
evidence of
increased pulmonary venous pressure, bilateral pleural effusions
with
compressive atelectasis, and probable engorgement of central
arteries
consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension or
lymphadenopathy.

Chest x-ray ([**2120-4-29**])
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-28**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
congestion and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis. Asymmetric
opacification at the right base could well reflect developing
consolidation.  Hilar prominence is again seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 49761**] is an 87 y/o female with a history of CHF, afib, pulm
htn [**3-7**] COPD who was transferred from BIDN for respiratory
distress, likely [**3-7**] pneumonia.

# Respiratory Distress: She was noted to have a RLL infiltrate
in the setting of fevers making pneumonia the likely diagnosis.
She also has a history of congestive heart failure whioch may be
contributing to her shortness of breath.  She was treated
initially with azithromycin, Vanc and Cefepime.  She improved
dramatically in terms of her shortness of breath and was able to
be weaned to 2L NC on day 3 of admission.  She was subsequently
transferred to the general medicine floor, at which time Vanc
and cefepime were discontinued.  On the medicine floor, she was
switched from azithromycin to levofloxacin and did very well.
Home bumetanide was also resumed on day of transfer to the
medicine floor.  She was weaned down to 2L NC with no fevers,
shortness of breath, cough or any signs of hemodynamic
instability.  She walked without worsening of symptoms.  Of
note, the patient recently qualified for home oxygen at 2L NC so
we will recommend that she be discharged on oxygen.  Plan
