Admission Date:  [**2184-1-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2184-1-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2127-9-7**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female
with multiple medical problems including COPD status post
multiple intubations, last intubation approximately one month
prior to admission, who presented to an outside hospital on
[**2184-1-17**] with acute shortness of breath along with cough and
wheezing.  She had apparently been in to see her
pulmonologist one day prior to admission with similar
complaints.

In the Emergency Department, she required intubation due to
increasing dyspnea and tachypnea.  Her ABG at the time was
7.19, 95, 114.  She was sent to the Intensive Care Unit at
the outside hospital for care from there.  She was given
Levaquin and IV steroids, and for presumptive diagnosis of
COPD exacerbation given her history of intubations for this
purpose in the past.

She was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] after what was apparently
a difficult intubation for concern for tracheal stenosis.
The patient was sent directly to the Intensive Care Unit at
[**Hospital3 **], where she underwent a rigid bronchoscopy on the
day of admission to the Intensive Care Unit on [**1-21**].  The
rigid bronchoscopy showed tracheobronchomalacia, and the
patient underwent dilation of area in her trachea.  There is
some stenosis as well as excision of scar tissue and
aspiration of secretions.  She was extubated one day post
bronchoscopy, and sent to the floor for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD on home O2 at 4 liters per minute.
2. Degenerative joint disease.
3. Hypertension.
4. Dyslipidemia.
5. Irritable bowel syndrome.
6. Type 2 diabetes.
7. GERD.
8. Depression.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Combivent.
2. Lisinopril 10.
3. Neurontin 800 p.o. t.i.d.
4. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Pepcid.
6. Verapamil 80 p.o. t.i.d.
7. Fentanyl patch 50 mcg q.72h.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine and Compazine.

FAMILY HISTORY:  She denies any pulmonary disease or cancer
in her family.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Status post cholecystectomy.
2. Right knee replacement.
3. Question of cardiac catheterization in the past, unknown
intervention.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a current smoker two packs per day
40-50 pack year history.  She had significant alcohol use in
the past, but currently denies.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature was 98.2, blood
pressure 139/72, pulse 84, and 79 kg.  She was on assist
control when she came to the Intensive Care Unit with a tidal
volume of 600, FIO2 of 40%.  Her ABG was 7.48, 46, and 110.
In general, she was in no acute distress, awake.  Appeared to
have responded appropriately with nods.  HEENT:  Pale
conjunctivae.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light.  No lymphadenopathy.
Obese neck.  Oropharynx difficult to visualize with ET tube,
but no evidence of lesions.  Cardiovascular examination:
Positive S1, positive S2 regular rate and rhythm.  Pulmonary:
Rare expiratory wheeze.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Trace
pitting edema to her calves.  Neurologic examination was
grossly intact.

SIGNIFICANT LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 19,000
with a normal differential, hematocrit of 39, platelets of
314.  Otherwise, unremarkable, and patient was ruled out for
a MI at the outside hospital with cardiac enzymes.
Urinalysis was negative.  She had a questionable negative
cardiac catheterization done in [**2181**].

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia:  The patient underwent a rigid
bronchoscopy on the day of admission to evaluate for
tracheostenosis.  She was noted to have tracheobronchomalacia
likely due to multiple intubations in the past.  She had
excision of scar tissue as well as removal of excess
secretions at the time.  The procedure went without
complications, and the following day she was sent to the
Medical floor for observation.  No device or stent was placed
at that time.

2. Respiratory distress:  The patient was likely intubated at
the outside hospital for COPD exacerbation, and was
ventilating fine on her current vent settings, and she was
aggressively tapered off the ventilator and on just
supplemental oxygen after one day in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was continued with supplemental oxygen on the
floor with good O2 saturations ranging from 95 to 97% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  The patient's antibiotics were changed
to azithromycin on her second hospital day to finish a
five-day course for bronchitis.  She was also continued on
nebulizers around-the-clock with Combivent and albuterol as
needed.  She was also given aggressive chest physical therapy
and encouraged to use incentive spirometry.

The patient was continued on prednisone at a dose of 40 mg
q.d., which is her outpatient dose and she was continued on
that until she saw her outpatient pulmonologist.  In
addition, given the patient's sleeping habits and noted
snoring and periods of apnea, she was encouraged to get an
outpatient sleep study and this was put in her discharge
plan.

3. Reflux laryngitis:  The patient was noted to have
significant redness and edema in her posterior oropharynx and
larynx, and was placed on Protonix for treatment of reflux
laryngitis.

4. Hypertension:  The patient was continued on her outpatient
verapamil dose with some elevated blood pressures during her
hospital stay, and was asked to with in the range of 140s to
150s and told to followup with her outpatient physician
regarding adjusting her medication.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home, tolerating low-flow supplemental
oxygen less than home requirements.  Home with VNA services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Combivent two puffs q.6h.
2. Neurontin 600 t.i.d.
3. Lisinopril 10 q.d.
4. Prednisone 40 q.d. x10 days, and then discuss with her
pulmonologist continued use of steroids.
5. Azithromycin 500 x2 more days.
6. Lorazepam 1 mg q.4-6h.
7. Verapamil 80 q.8.
8. Protonix 40 q.d.
9. Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  She is to followup with her pulmonologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**4-2**] days.  She is also to followup with her
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-30**] weeks.
