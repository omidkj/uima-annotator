Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfered from [**Hospital6 **] for Left Periprosthetic femur
fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open Reduction Internal Fixation of Left periprosthetic Femur
Fracture ([**2168-10-25**])


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 89 yo lady w/ h/o HTN, RA, who was admitted on [**2168-10-22**]
s/p multiple falls at her nursing home, which resulted in Left
peri-prosthetic femur fracture. She had an initial Left hip
fracture after mechanical fall on [**2168-9-30**]. At that time, she
was seen at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital where a L hip hemiarthroplasty
was done. By report, post op course c/b anemia and oversedation.
She was d/[**Hospital 65061**] Nursing Home on [**10-5**], and since then,
she has continued to have multiple falls, now leading to
fracture at prosthesis site.
Upon admit [**10-22**], patient had stable VS with mild tachy, but was
noted to be confused. She was given morphine for pain control.
She had a negative head CT, CTA neg for PE (but CT chest showed
9x5 mm left lingular nodule and COPD). Her femur films showed
fracture of proximal left femur immediately distal to distal tip
of prosthesis w/ medial displacement and slight anterior
angulation of distal fracture fragment. She was partially
reduced by ortho in ED and placed in traction with plan for O.R
when clinically stable. She was noted to have sinus tach to
100's, thought to be due to pain/hypovolemia. Given admission
hct of 24.9 (from baseline 34), she was thus admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for hct watch and close monitoring. She was guiac negative but
team was concerned for thigh vs RP collection.They were unable
to get CT w/ leg in traction but hct stabalized. She rec'd three
units of prbc's pre op and went to O.R. on [**2168-10-25**] for ORIF of
left hip prosthetic fracture. EBL 800 cc. She has received a
total of 7 units of prbc's to date (4 in last 24 hrs).
Post op last night, pt noted to be hypotensive to 90's and
tachycardic to 100's with decreased UOP. She was thought to be
in AF, started on amio gtt, lopressor, then neosynehphrine was
started as well. There was concern for post op bleeding and CT
scan of surgical site completed w/o evidence of bleed. CTA also
done given A-a gradient and tachycardia post op. Swan floated
through RIJ. Has femoral A line. She remains intubated currently
and her BP, HR have normalized. She is sedated. SICU team
requested transfer to MICU service.

Diagnostic Studies:
[**2168-10-21**] RIGHT FEMUR, THREE VIEWS
Again seen is a fracture of the proximal femur immediately
distal to the distal tip of the prosthesis. There is medial
displacement, bandaging, and slight anterior angulation of the
distal fracture fragment, however, this appears to be improved
in position in comparison to prior study.
.
[**2168-10-21**] CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. There is a 9 X 5-mm nodule within the left lingula. Given the
patient's underlying extensive emphysematous disease and the
appearance of the nodule, we suggest obtaining prior studies
from elsewhere for comparison. In the absence of this,
short-term followup should be obtained in two months' time to
evaluate for interval change. Small bronchogenic neoplasm cannot
be excluded.
3. There is a hiatal hernia. Given the appearance of this, with
a lack of intraluminal air and the soft tissue prominence,
correlation to barium swallow study is suggested.
.
CT Head [**2168-10-21**]
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. The ventricles are
symmetric, there is no shift of normally midline structures.
There are multiple areas of decreased attenuation within the
periventricular subcortical white matter, consistent with
chronic small-vessel ischemic infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Minimal mucosal thickening is
noted within the right maxillary sinus. No air-fluid levels are
seen. The soft tissue structures are otherwise normal. No
fractures are identified.
.
CT Head [**2168-10-27**]
The study is limited secondary to significant motion. Within the
left frontal lobe, there is an area of decreased attenuation,
involving both the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter in the distribution of
the left MCA artery, and likely represents an area of recent
infarction. The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift
of normally midline structures. There is decreased attenuation
in the periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic
small vessel ischemic infarction.
There is bilateral mastoid opacification, and mild mucosal
thickening in the right maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.
No definite areas of intracranial hemorrhage are seen.
.
[**2168-10-28**] EEG
This is a normal portable EEG. No lateralizing or
epileptiform abnormalities were seen. Frequent ventricular
ectopies
with couples were seen.
.
[**2168-10-28**] Carotid US
Atherosclerotic plaque is present in the carotid arteries
bilaterally as described above. There is no significant carotid
stenosis (evaluated as less than 40% stenosis bilaterally).


Brief Hospital Course:
89 y/o female who was admitted on [**2168-10-21**] for treatment of left
periprosthetic femur fracture after a fall. Initial workup ruled
out PE and stroke. She was found to have first degree heart
block on EKG. CT of head revealed evidence of chronic small
vessel infarcts. She was treated by the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team and eventually
transfered to the SICU service after ORIF of left femur by
orthopedics on [**2168-10-25**]. Post op she was hypotensive and
tacycardic requiring pressors, swan ganz catheter, and
antiarrythmia agents for suspected AFib. A CTA ruled out PE. She
was subsequently transfered to the MICU service for management
of hypotension and arrhythmia. She received fluids, was weaned
from pressors, and was stabilized.  Swan ganz was removed. She
was slow to recover from sedation and had a CT of the head which
revealed subacute left frontal stroke. Neurology was consulted
and she had repeat head CT which was unchanged, her SBP was kept
>120, blood sugars were tightly controled, and fevers were
minimized with tylenol. Echo showed normal LVEF, Carotid US
showed less than 40% Stenosis bilaterally, EEG was negative for
seizures. She was started on coumadin 4mgQHS for
anticoagulation. Her unresponsiveness continued and workup for
toxic metabolic cause was unreveiling. She was taken off any
sedating medicat
