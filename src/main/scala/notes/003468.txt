History of Present Illness:
55 yo M who presented to his PCP's office in early [**Month (only) **]
[**2200**]
with chest pain and EKG changes. Pt was sent to the ED at
[**Hospital3 1443**], subsequently admitted, and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease. Surgery was delayed secondary to
persistent fevers. He was found to C. Diff and was treated with
flagyl. Workup at that time was also notable for multiple
pulmonary emboli and he has been placed on lovenox until his
surgery. He returns today for evaluation and rescheduling of
surgery. He has felt very well since discharge and denies any
symptoms of fever, chest pain or dyspnea.

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-11-26**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior, anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate
([**2-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A very eccentric posterior
directed MR was seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is in
sinus rhythm

1. Biventricular function is normal
2. Eccentric MR still present
3. Aorta is unchanged post decannulation
4. Other findings are unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-11-26**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to five vessels(Left Internal Mammary Artery >Left
Anterior Descending artery ,Saphenous Vein Grafted >diag
Y>Obtuse Marginal 1,>OM2,SVG>PLB). Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **]
operative report for further details. Postoperatively he was
transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the
next several hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed.All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.  On
postoperative day one, he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. His electrolytes were repleted as needed.
He was started on Coumadin for a history of PE. On POD2 he
experienced rapid atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm
with amiodarone IV converted to PO. The ACE was restarted.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation of increasing
mobility and strength and cleared him for discharge to home.
POD4 he had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with
spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. The remainder of his
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. He continued to
progress and was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to home
with VNA on POD# 5. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 5686**] will follow the Coumadin
dosing, with first INR draw to be done on Thurs. [**12-4**]. All
follow up appointments were advised.
