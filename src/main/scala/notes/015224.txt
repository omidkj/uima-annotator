Stool ([**12-27**]): C diff positive

Blood cx ([**12-29**]): MRSA 3/4 bottles
Blood cx ([**12-30**]): MRSA

Urine cx ([**12-29**]): no growth

ECHO ([**2116-12-30**]):
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is  moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior,  inferolateral and inferoseptal akinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and  free wall motion are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic  valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No  aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**2116-12-29**]):  Mild CHF may be improved compared to [**2116-12-26**].
Otherwise, unchanged exam with stable cardiomegaly and
retrocardiac opacity.

UE doppler US:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**]
examination of the left upper extremity venous system was
performed. Nonocclusive thrombus is seen within the left
internal jugular vein and left subclavian vein. Normal
compressibility, color flow and waveforms are seen within the
left axillary vein. Normal color flow and waveforms are seen
within the left cephalic, basilic, and brachial veins.

TEE ([**2117-1-7**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic. The left
ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely
depressed.There is significant calcification in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no
vegetations or abscess.  Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no vegetations
or abscess. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is a graft in the descending
thoracic aorta. No abscess is seen around the graft, however CT
scan or MRI would be a more accurate test to rule out the
diagnosis.  No TEE evidence of endocarditis.

CT abdomen ([**2117-1-8**]):
  1) Small left inguinal fluid collection with surrounding fat
stranding. This can be seen post-procedurally. However, a
superimposed infection cannot be excluded radiographically.
  2) Extensive vascular calcification with the endograft in the
thoracic aorta.
  3) Simple bilateral moderate pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Thoracic aortic aneurysm:  he was transferred from OSH on
[**2116-12-21**] for treatment of T10-level aortic aneurysm discovered on
CT scan.  He underwent endovascular aneurysm repair w/ stent
placement on [**2116-12-22**], during which he lost 2500cc blood and
received 10units PRBCs.  There were no procedural complications.
 He was treated w/ heparin gtt after his surgery for
anticoagulation; meanwhile, he was started on coumadin therapy
for a goal INR of [**1-21**].  When goal INR was achieved, heparin gtt
was d/c and he was continued on coumadin.  His aortic stent was
observed to be in the proper position by serial CXRs during his
admission, w/ no signs or symptoms of bleeding.  He does not
require further anticoagulation for his vascular grafts after
d/c, but must continue coumadin for treatment of DVT as below.
He will require follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28610**] in Vascular
Surgery clinic in [**12-20**] weeks after d/c.

2. MRSA bacteremia: approximately 1 week after surgery, the pt
became febrile.  Blood cultures were drawn, and grew MRSA.  The
patient's left IJ central line was d/c on the 1st day of fever,
and was noted to contain purulent fluid; the catheter tip was
cultured and grew MRSA, making infected line the most likely
source of bacteremia.  A new right subclavian central line was
placed, and treatment was begun w/ vancomyin on [**2116-12-30**].  The pt
defervesced after 24 hours of vancomycin therapy, and was
monitored w/ daily surveillance cultures.  Surveillance cultures
on [**12-14**], and [**1-5**] grew MRSA despite continuing vancomycin
treatment, raising concern for possible bacterial seeding of
cardiac valves or vascular graft.  He was evaluated w/ TEE,
which showed no evidence of endocarditis, and w/ abdominal CT,
which showed no evidence of vascular graft infection.  ID
service was consulted, and believed that positive surveillance
cultures were most likely [**1-20**] infected left IJ thrombus w/
intermittent bacterial showering.  The pt was continued on
vancomycin therapy, and gentamicin was added for synergy and to
assist with clearance of bacteremia.  After 2
