Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
aspiration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of severe COPD on home
oxygen(4L), diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis who was
recently discharged to [**Hospital1 **] after admission for aspiration
pna/pneumonitis who now presents with increasing shortness of
breath after aspirating. She was being treated at her [**Hospital 4382**] for Pneumonia with Vanc/Zosyn through PICC, however she
had an aspiration event during dinner, unable to take meds and
possibly in need of NG tube prompting transfer to the ED. There
she was placed on a NRB and unable to wean down, so admitted to
ICU.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.3 HR 89 afib BP 118/72 RR 28
POx 100% on NRB. CXR showed worsening Right effusion and [**Name6 (MD) **]
[**Name8 (MD) **] MD, family would be okay with feeding tube in setting
of chronic aspiration.

On floor she appears comfortable on 100% face mask.  She denies
SOB and does not recall why she is here.  She is confused when
we attempt to explain what has happened and cannot re-iterate
the consequences of chronic aspiration or a PEG tube when
explained to her.

Review of systems:
(+) She does state she has some belly pain and has not stooled
in several days.
(-) Denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

BEDSIDE SWALLOW EVAL:
1. Suggest determining goals of care with planned family
meeting.
2. If the family wishes to continue to allow the pt to eat,
understanding the risks of intermittent aspiration, I would
suggest the following:
a) PO diet of thin liquids and moist ground solids
b) strict supervision for meals- pt needs to be fed to reduce
risk of aspiration
c) slow rate of increase - take breaks during intake to allow RR
to return to baseline
d) take down high flow mask and then return after each bite and
sip
e) pills crushed with puree
f) alternate between bites and sips
g) sit upright for 30 minutes after meals
3. If the family wishes to get a more objective view of her
swallowing, we can certainly take her for a video swallow, but I
do not feel it will be representative of a full meal and may not
reveal the occasional aspiration episodes that are occurring.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Aspiration: Patient with known chronic aspiration risk, unable
to take PO meds at [**Hospital1 **].  She gets confused during attempts
to explain what has happened during her aspiration events likely
due to her baseline dementia. Had S&S study in [**3-3**] with
recommendation for soft dysphagia diet. HCP and grandson met
with palliative care, social work, and with ICU team regarding
peg tube placement. Decided NO PEG tube but are not ready to
make decision re: no further hospitalizations/hospice.

# Hypoxia/Hypercarbia - Baseline PO2 in 60s with PCO2 in 70s.
Etiology is most likely worsening right pleural effusion vs.
aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Underlying COPD,
kyphoscoliosis contributing. ABG with improved hypercarbia from
baseline - PCO2 68. Had lactate of 1.7.  Was receiving coverage
for health-care associated with vanc/zosyn (Day 1=[**2196-5-4**] on
previous admission).  We continued these abx here and she
remained afebrile. Was kept on Non-invasive ventilation when
sleeping to keep sats 89-92%.
- Vanc and Zosyn to end on [**2196-5-15**]

# COPD  and restrictive lung disease from severe
scoliosis/kyphosis on home O2 (3-4L at baseline): On admission
bicarb was at her baseline suggesting no CO2 retention.
She was continued on atrovent/albuterol nebs.

# A fib on coumadin: Last INR was [**2196-5-6**] 2.3 and she was
initially rate-controlled although off home beta blocker she had
HRs in 100s. She was restarted on Diltiazem with good rate
control.  Long-term anticoagulation with coumadin would not be
beneficial, so she was kept on a full dose aspirin.

# Acute on chronic Diastolic heart failure: ECHO from [**10/2195**]
showed EF of 70-80% with Mild PAH and significant pulmonic
regurg. IV lasix was given PRN while NPO.

# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

# Goals of Care: The family will discuss further what things
would constitute most
important "quality of life" for Ms. [**Known lastname 54770**], and clinical plans
will be guided by that.  For now she will continue IV
antibiotics, other meds as needed for her chronic illnesses, and
efforts will be made to wean her from the mask that she does not
like.
