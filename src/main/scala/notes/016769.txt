Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 5448**] is an 86 year old female with h/o atrial fibrillation
and AVNRT who presents with AVNRT and hypotension.

#. AVNRT - patient has history of past episodes of AVRNT.  On
this admission, she was again noted to have AVNRT, rhythm was
broken with adenosine x6 times on this admission, but recurred
following the first 5 tries.  On the last administration of
adenosine, patient stayed in NSR.  Given history of recurrent
AVNRT, patient underwent successful EP ablation.  Patient will
continue on full dose aspirin for at least 1 month.

# Hypotension: patient presented with SBP in the high 80s.
Following conversion from AVNRT to NSR, blood pressure improved.
 Patient had no sign of sepsis on clinical exam, and no growth
from blood cultures.  Diuretics were initially held on admission
given hypotension, but were restarted on discharge.
.
# Renal insufficiency: unknown baseline creatinine.  On her last
admission, she had a creatinine of 1.4-1.5, however improved to
1.1 on discharge.  Her creatinine increased suddenly to 2.1 on
[**4-5**] in the setting of mild dehydration. Her creatinine is now
improving and is 1.7 today. Her diuretics were held and
restarted at discharge. She has no signs of infection or
evidence of ATN. No medication changes to cause nephritis. Chem
7 should be checked again on Monday [**4-9**]. K was initially
high, then has required repletion. She is discharged on 20 meq
daily.

# Chronic Diastolic CHF: Pt was without symptoms on admission
and appeared euvolemic on exam.  Diuretics were initially help
for hypotension, but with reversion to normal sinus rhythm
following adenosine and ablation, patient's hemodynamics
stablized.  Patient will resume diuretics on discharge. She
appears to have mild fluid overload with 1+ peripheral edema but
has clear lung fields and no O2 requirement.

# CAD: Patient was noted to have troponin of 0.02 on admission
in the setting of tachyarrhythmia.  Cardiac enzymes trended down
to 0.01 following reversion to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient was
continued on ASA, metoprolol, and simvastatin.

# Depression/Dementia: patient was continued on citalopram,
effexor, and risperidone. Her mental status has waxed and waned
but she has always been responsive with no signs of agitation.

# Chronic constipation: patient was continued on senna and
colace. Last BM on [**4-5**].
