Admission Date:  [**2159-11-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2159-11-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2088-6-20**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Elective cardiac catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male who presented to his primary care physician's office for
evaluation of shortness of breath and chest tightness brought
on by raking leaves.

He was referred to an outside hospital for evaluation in late
[**Month (only) **]; at which time he ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  He was noted to be in pulmonary edema at the
time, however, and had an echocardiogram on [**2159-11-3**]
which revealed a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction
of 15% to 20%, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid
regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, with estimated
pulmonary artery pressures of 40 mmHg to 45 mmHg, left
ventricular hypertrophy, and diffuse hypokinesis.

The patient was admitted for elective catheterization.  He
had been having ongoing dyspnea since his hospitalization,
but the chest tightness had not recurred.  He denied any
orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He had not had an
lower extremity edema.  During his recent hospitalization, he
had been diuresed approximately 10 pounds and has not
regained any of that weight.

A catheterization on the day of admission revealed he had a
90% stenosis of the right coronary artery. He underwent
successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stenting with prior percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty atherectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  High cholesterol.
3.  Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago.
4.  Status post appendectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother had coronary artery disease which
was diagnosed in her 50s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He is an
ex-drinker; he quit 10 years ago.  He has a history of
tobacco use which he quit 10 years ago as well.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed the patient
was afebrile, blood pressure was 114/65, heart rate was 78,
pulse oximetry was 97% on room air.  In general, he was
alert, lying supine in bed, in no acute distress.  His pupils
were reactive.  His sclerae were anicteric.  His jugular
venous pressure was measured at 5 cm to 6 cm.  His heart
examination revealed a normal first heart sound and second
heart sound with no murmurs or gallops.  His lungs were clear
bilaterally except for slight crackles at the bases.  His
abdominal examination was benign.  His feet were cool with
faint dorsalis pedis pulses palpable bilaterally.  At the
time of examination, the patient had a compression device
over the left groin.

CATHETERIZATION DATA:  The patient had an intra-aortic
balloon pump placed prophylactically prior to
catheterization.  Blood oximetry at the time of
catheterization revealed 64% saturation in the superior vena
cava, 65% in the pulmonary artery, and 97% arterial
saturation.  His cardiac output and index were 4.05 and 2.04;
respectively.  Wedge pressure was 11.  Pulmonary artery
pressure was 36/15, with a mean of 23.  Right ventricular
pressure was 37/6.

Left ventriculography revealed mild-to-moderate mitral
regurgitation and severely reduced left ventricular function
with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%.

Coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system with a
normal left main coronary artery.  The left anterior
descending artery had minimal luminal irregularities with an
apical 80% lesion in a small segment of the vessel.  The left
circumflex was not obstructed, but the obtuse marginal (which
was a large branch) had a 60% mid vessel lesion.  The right
coronary artery had an 80% ostial lesion and proximal lesion.
The right coronary artery lesion had a rotational
atherectomy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,
and successful stent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  Immediately following
catheterization, the patient was moved to the Coronary Care
Unit; at which time the intra-aortic balloon pump was
discontinued approximately one hour after arrival to the
Coronary Care Unit.  He had a transient episode of
hypotension during which his blood pressure fell to a
systolic pressure of 70s to 80s.  He was asymptomatic.  The
sheath and balloon pump were pulled and pressure applied for
approximately 30 minutes with no complications of bleeding.
He had good distal pulses afterward.  He was continued on
Integrilin for a total of 18 hours which was discontinued on
the morning of [**2159-11-13**].

The morning following the procedure, the patient had no
complaints and was discharged to home with some slight
changes in his cardiac medications.

2.  TYPE 2 DIABETES:  The patient was covered with a
sliding-scale during his admission.  He was restarted on his
outpatient oral hyperglycemics at the time of discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Quinapril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Glucophage 800 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was instructed
to call his primary care physician and make an appointment
with his outpatient cardiologist in the next one to two
weeks.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  He was discharged in good condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Three vessel coronary artery disease; status post right
coronary artery rotablation, percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty, and stent.
