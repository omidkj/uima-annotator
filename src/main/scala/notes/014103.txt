Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 61 yo male with PMH of HTN, HLD who presents with
progressive dyspnea. Two to three weeks ago patient began to
experience dyspea, intially only with exertion, particularly
with climbing stairs. His symptoms progressed and he began to
have dyspnea with minimal DOE. He also had profound orthopnea
and PND and was unable to sleep unless he was sitting upright.
He also began developing LE edema over the past few says. He
denies palpitations, chest pain, lightheadedness.
He then went to the [**Hospital3 **] ED. He was diuresed with iv
lasix. An echo was obtained which showed EF 55%, mod to severe
AI and elevated pulm pressures. He was transfered for cath to [**Hospital1 **]
for ischemia evalation.
In cath lab, right and left cath were done. Wedge was 34, pa
systolic pressure 90, aortic pressure 200s, aortagram with 3+
AI. Coranaries showed occulded RCA, chronic, some disease in LCx
and LAD. The sheath was pulled at 4:45. He was given 100mg IV
lasix and nitro gtt was started. He was transfered to the CCU on
NRB.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Radiology:
Cardiac Cath ([**2-24**]) - Preliminary Report
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated two vessel and branch vessel coronary artery
disease.  The
LMCA was normal in appearence.  The LAD had a distal occlusion
and a 70%
lesion in the first diagonal branch.  The LCx had a mid 50%
vessel
narrowing and a 70% stenosis in the LPL branch.  The RCA had a
total
chronic occlusion with left to right collateral filling.
2.  Ascending aortography demonstrated severe aortic
insufficiency with
retograde filling of the left ventricle within two heart beats.
No
dissection flap noted.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severly elevated left
ventricular
filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 38 mmHg.  There was also
severly
elevated pulmonary hypertension, with a PASP of 77mmHg.  The
mean PAP
did not improved with inhaled 100%FiO2, but did lower with
reduction in
systemic blood pressure.  The patient had severe systemic
hypertension,
with a central aortic pressure of 220/87 mmHg.  This improved
with IV
lasix and nitroglycerine bolus/gtt.  There was no significant
transaortic valvular gradient on careful pullback.  Cardiac
index was
preserved, with a CI of 2.5 L/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2.  Severe aortic insufficency.
3.  Severe systemic hypertension.
4.  Severe pulmonary hypertension.
5.  Severly elevated left ventricular filling pressures.

PCXR ([**2-24**]):
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary venous hypertension. Cardiomegaly.
.
ECHO ([**2-25**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. Quantitative
(3D) LVEF = 42%. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with a hypoplastic
appearance to the right coronary cusp. There are no vegetations
seen. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation in a
trileaflet valve, mostly through the apparently-hypoplastic
right coronary cusp. Moderately dilated left ventricle with mild
global biventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
Chest CTA ([**2-25**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary embolism of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery,
mainly
involving the anterior segment. No right heart strain.
2. No evidence of thoracic aortic aneurysm. Aortic regurgitation
cannot be
assessed on non-ECG-gated CT images. Echocardiography or MRI
might be
considered for further workup.
3. Moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown origin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year-old man with a PMH of hypertension and
dyslipidemia who presents with 2-3 weeks of progressive
shortness of breath, signs and symptoms of CHF found to have
severe aortic regurgitation on echocardiogram and right upper
lobe pulmonary embolism on CT angiogram.

# CHF with aortic insufficiency: Patient had no history of valve
abnormality and the eitology was further evaluated with 3D
echocardiogram that revealed a tri-leaflet valve and an LVEF of
42%. There was no evidence of endocarditis on echocardiogram. It
is likely that his CHF/AI was exacerbated in the setting of his
severe hypertension with SBP 200 on admission and possibly by PE
that was later found on CTA. Preexising CHF may have caused
aortic annulus dilation worsening the AI and AI was likely
contributing to worsened heart failure. On cath, patient had
elevated pulmononic pressures and was therefore diuresed. Pt was
started on metoprolol 50mg TID to control heart rate and kept on
home losartan for BP control. Metoprolol was ultimately
uptitrated to 200mg daily at time of discharge. CT surgery
consult was obtained. Severe elevation in LV pressure was
somewhat more consistent with fairly acute regurgitation to
which the heart had not yet had a chance to compensate v
