Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch. No 2D or
Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate/severe MVP. Moderate thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Torn mitral chordae. No MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse
(predominantly the posterior leaflet). There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Torn mitral chordae are
present with prolapse through the mitral valve in systole.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mitral valve prolapse with moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition and Heparin
was begun for atrial fibrillation.  Dental clearance was
obtained and Mitral valve repair and annuloplasty with a 32mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Saddle Ring was performed on [**5-1**].  See operative note
for details.  Attempts at DCCV prebypass resulted in VF and the
institution of urgent bypass. Amiodarone was administered
postoperatively. A MAZE procedure was not undertaken due to the
dilated atrium. His LVEF was 25-30% after surgery by TEE.

He weaned from bypass on Epinephrine, neosynephrine ansd
Propofol.  He transferred back to the CVICU where Milrinone was
begun due to low CI with elevated SVR despite adequate volume
resuscitation.  His index rose, epinephrine was stopped and he
remained stable.  He was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated easily.  The Milrinone and neosynephrine were weaned
and beta blockde was resumed with good ventricular rate control.
Diuretics were administered and coumadin resumed.

Following transfer to the floor he was ambulated, PT worked with
him for strength and mobility and medications were titrated for
maximum bebefit.

He was discharged home having been instructed to medications,
restrictions and followup care.  Arrangements were made for
Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 1075**] to follow and manage his Coumadin.
