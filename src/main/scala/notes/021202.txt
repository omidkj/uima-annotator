Brief Hospital Course:

controlled, she was placed on [**Hospital1 **] NPH with an inuslin sliding
scale and transfered to the gyn floor.  Pt complained of tooth
pain.  She was seen by dental consult service and noted that
there was no acute issue.  She was advised to keep her op appt
with her dentist for likely tooth extraction.

Pt transfered to Gyn floor on [**10-12**] her finger sticks were
labile in the 40s to 200s range and were better controlled after
adjusting both her NPH fixed doses and sliding scale.  She
recieved education regarding the management of her diabetes.

She left AMA without signing documentation on [**10-13**].  She
