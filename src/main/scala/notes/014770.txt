Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and cough x 2-3 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2114-2-12**]
Left thoracentesis [**2114-2-6**]

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83 year-old male with H/O hypertension,
diet-controlled type II diabetes mellitus, and renal carcinoma
s/p partial right nephrectomy in [**2111**] who presents with dry
cough and shortness of breath x 2-3 weeks. Per OMR, he was seen
at PCP's office two weeks ago for cough. He was treated with
Augmentin for 10 days, but it is unclear if he took this. In
addition, at that time, he had stopped all of his medications
because he felt he was taking too many. His HR was reported at
113 at that visit- no mention of regular or irregular rhythm. He
was explained the need to continue medications.

On presentation, the patient reported dry cough and shortness of
breath x 2-3 weeks with worsening over 1 day PTA. He denied
coughing anything up, but another note in OMR said he had been
productive of yellow sputum. Per his family, he has had a
chronic non-productive cough for several years, but this has
been worsening over the past month. The patient denies fevers,
chills. He reports palpitations, nausea when coughing a lot,
wheezing (unclear for how long or whether he has a history of
wheezing), decreased appetite, swelling in legs, orthopnea.
There was no chest pain or pleuritic chest pain, vomiting,
diarrhea, myalgias, fatigue.  He is unsure about weight loss.

In the ED, his vitals were T 94.5, BP 139/83, HR 125, RR 24, O2
sat 94% on RA. He was noted to be in ? SVT v. atrial flutter v.
atrial fibrillation seen on multiple EKGs. He was given
diltiazem 10 mg IV x2 and then diltiazem 30 mg PO  x1. He
continued to have rapid ventricular rate and was placed on a
diltiazem drip. He was also given Levoquin and ASA. Per ED
notes, he had a bedside ultrasound placed on the heart which
showed no effusion, but uncoordinated atrial activity.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.  Cardiac review of systems is notable
for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope
or presyncope.

ECG [**2114-2-2**]  5:35:56 PM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 123 bpm.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Intraventricular conduction defect. Borderline voltage criteria
for left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes may be
related to left ventricular hypertrophy/rate or rhythm. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2110-10-13**] atrial fibrillation is new.

[**2114-2-2**] CXR
Respiratory motion compromises the study. There is a massive
cardiomegaly again identified. There is a tortuous aorta.
Pulmonary vascularity is indistinct which may be in part due to
respiratory motion, although mild element of underlying edema
cannot be excluded. Increased density is noted in both lung
bases, particularly in the retrocardiac left lower lobe. There
is poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm. No definite right
effusion is seen. There is no large underlying pneumothorax. A
levoconcave curvature of the thoracic spine is again identified.

[**2114-2-3**] CXR (PA & lat):
Frontal and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate severe
cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions left greater
than right and pulmonary vascular redistribution suggesting mild
failure. There is no definite infiltrate.

CXR ([**2114-2-5**]): Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, worsening
upper zone vascular redistribution.  Bilateral pleural effusions
also appear slightly larger.

ECHO ([**2114-2-5**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30-35%) with severe
hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and moderate
hypokinesis of the remaining segments. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
