respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with dementia, hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
UGIB, was transferred from [**Hospital3 2558**] nursing home after
being found on the floor with respiratory distress. BP 99/58, HR
106, O2 sat 90% -> improved to 94% with suctioning. Patient was
alert and oriented x 2, similar to baseline.
.
Of note, patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2105-11-6**] after
6-day admission for duodenal bleed. Hct was in mid-20s on
discharge.
.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, rectal temp 100.6, HR 106, 97/58,
RR 17, O2 sat 100% on NRB. He was dyspneic with rhonchi
throughout on exam. CXR was unremarkable, but WBC was 13 with a
left shift. ABG was 7.51/28/207. Patient was intubated due to
increased work of breathing. Post-intubation CXR showed ET tube
in proper location. NGT was placed. SBP transiently dropped to
80s, improved quickly with IVF boluses. Was given vancomycin
1000 mg IV x 1 and pip-tazo 4.5 gm IV x 1.

[**2105-11-13**] CT head 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 2. Brain
atrophy.
3. Soft tissue density in bilateral external auditory canals,
likely reflects cerumen- recommend correlation with direct
visualization.

NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: An alternative explanation for the
supratentorial ventricular dilatation is communicating
hydrocephalus. In any case, the ventricular dilatation, as noted
above, is stable since the earliest available scan, from [**2103-8-21**].


[**2105-11-13**] CXR:
Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions with no evidence of
an acute
pulmonary process. There right humeral head appears inferiorly
subluxed,
unchaged from prior examination and clinical correlation is
recomended.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Respiratory distress/sepsis: related to likely pulmonary
infection, though no evidence of pneumonia by chest xray.
Intubated and required pressors for several days, and ultimately
completed a 7 day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn. Mr. [**Known lastname **] had
significant difficulty managing and clearing secretions and had
several episodes of aspiration with respiratory diress/hypoxia
during his course. Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is a likely
cause of his presentation.  His suctioning requirement increased
toward the end of his course, and after discussion with his
wife, the decision was made to make him CMO rather than transfer
to the ICU for aggressive pulmonary care. Mr. [**Known lastname **] died on
[**2105-11-26**].

2. Agitation/delirium: due to medical illness, complicated by
recurrent aspiration events.  Nonpharmacologic meaures were
employed, as well as antipsychotic medications.  This worsened
despite attention to multiple medical conditions.  Geriatrics
team consulted.

3. Tachycardia: intermittent runs of SVT and sinus with PACs.
Persistent over the last 48 hours of his course, associated with
hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities and agitation.

4. Anemia: had bleeding duodenal ulcers on previous
hospitalization. Presented with a low HCT and was transfused 3
units of prbc.  Hemolysis parameters did not indicate ongoing
hemolysis as cause of anemia.  He was continued on prednisone
and danazol as he was able to take. When unable to take po
prednisone, was given IV solumedrol at equivalent dose.

5. BPH/Yeast UTI: had traumatically inserted catheter with
cystoscopic guidance by urology at admission.  Urine became
dark/cloudy with pyuria. Persistently grew yeast. Given ongoing
altered mental status, and decision made to treat with
fluconazole.

6. Positive troponin: during time of respiratory
distress/intubation--more likely the result of the acute insult,
not the cause given that CK remained normal. Not a candidate for
aspirin given ulcerations. ECG demonstrated <1mm STD in V4 only
at admission.

7. Acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency: during
the course, he remained volume sensitive. Improved with
resuscitation.

8. FEN: had video swallow on [**11-23**] which cleared him for
ground/thickened liquids. The patient was able to tolerate
applesauce/pills well. Despite this, he continued to aspirate
and could not clear secretions (see above)

9. Disposition: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was made CMO by his wife on [**2105-11-25**]
and expired on [**2105-11-26**].
