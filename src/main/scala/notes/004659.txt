Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right subclavian central line

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67581**] is a 68 year old woman with a history of epilepsy and
multiple episodes of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (the last
in [**4-21**]), with resultant
complications including encephalopathy and ICU neuromyopathy.
She resides at a nursing home, where today she was noted to be
febrile to 102, and non responsive.  No further details about
the last time when she was seen normal are provided in the
transfer note.  At baseline she is alert and conversant. She was
reportedly trembling and it was unclear whether this was related
to a fever or represented seizure activity. She was transported
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where she was noted to be unresponsive upon
arrival.  She was given vancomycin and levofloxacin, as well as
IV normal saline.  At 2:45 p.m., per nursing notes, transient
twitching of the eyes and lips was noted.  This stopped after a
few minutes, and then at 3:45 p.m. she had a 90 second episode
of right arm twitching.  She was given 0.5 mg Ativan, and
neurology was consulted.

She continued to have eye and lip twitching and was felt to be
in non-convulsive status epilepticus.

Review of systems:  Patient unable to relate details, but no
recent reported systemic illnesses.  Had a fall out of
wheelchair on [**2-14**], head CT with no acute changes at that time.
Last hospitalization was in late [**Month (only) 1096**], for C.Diff infection.

ED course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67581**] received 1.5 mg Ativan IV at 4:10 p.m. without any
change in her examination. At one point the tone in her right
arm briefly increased, but there was no rigidity and no
twitching movements of the limb. She was brought to the EEG lab
where EEG revealed that she was indeed in non-convulsive status
epilepticus. She was given 1 mg Ativan IV while in EEG, without
any change in the EEG. She was brought back to the ED on bedside
EEG, and received another 1 mg IV Ativan without significant
effect. Head CT revealed no acute change (atrophy, vermian
hypoplasia) After this she was given the 5 mg/kg phenobarbital
IV that had been ordered, and the EEG improved to reveal
multifocal spikes. She was loaded with dilantin 1000 mg IV. She
was also given a dose of Ceftriaxone 2g. She was noted to have
copious foul-smelling stool; C. diff was tested (and ultimately
returned positive). Blood pressures were stably low at
100's/40's - 50's and HR remained in 110's. She received a total
of 2L NS while in the ED.

Past Medical History:
- Epilepsy: (followed by [**Known lastname **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**])
Complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. Onset in
teenage years.  At least four known episodes of non-convulsive
status epilepticus since [**2183**], and mention of episodes as far
back as [**2174**]. Hospitalizations for status this year in [**2-21**] and
[**4-21**] (at NYU - moved to [**Location (un) 86**] over the summer). Altered
personality and cognitive ability prominent from [**2-21**] following
episode of status  epilepticus. There is a history of post-ictal
psychosis in [**2-21**]. During hospitalization for status in [**Month (only) 547**] of
[**2185**], she developed numerous complications, including
bronchitis, UTIs, line sepsis, and critical illness
polyneuropathy, requiring ongoing physical, occupational, and
speech therapy, as well as a brief tracheostomy. She has a
residual expressive aphasia.  She had hepatotoxicity from
depakote in the past.  PET scan revealed decreased metabolism in
both temporal lobes, following all of these episodes of status.
Last neurology admission was in [**12-21**], for altered mental status
which proved not to represent seizure activity.

General appearance: Thin 68 year old woman lying in bed with
eyes closed in NAD.  Intermittent twitching of both eyes and
mouth.
HEENT:  NC/AT, neck supple with full ROM
CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.

mm, reactive to 3 mm.  Eyelids twitch rhythmically, sometimes
suppressible for a brief period.  No corneal reflexes, no
grimace to facial tickle.  No oculocephalic reflexes.  Face
appears symmetric. Intermittent symmetric facial twitching. Weak
gag.

Cultures pending: blood, urine

Imaging:
Chest X-ray:
FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated, limiting evaluation.  Lung
volumes are mildly diminished with bronchovascular reorientation
in the lung bases.  No focal consolidation or superimposed edema
is appreciated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The cardiac
silhouette remains within normal limits for size.  Bones are
diffusely osteopenic.
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with no acute pulmonary process.

Head CT:
INDICATION:  Seizure.
COMPARISON:  [**2186-2-14**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  The examination is markedly limited
by overlying EEG leads and gross patient motion.  No gross
hemorrhage or shift of the midline structures is appreciated.
Parenchyma is assessed on approximately half of the images.
Repeat exam is advised with removal of EEG leads.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2186-3-7**] 9:13 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe inflammation of the rectum, sigmoid colon. This
appearance is suggestive of colitis most consistent with the
patient history of C. diff colitis.
2. Necrotic lymph node in the left lower lumbar area measuring
23 x 24 mm that is most likely reactive in etiology.
3. Consolidation of the right lower lobe that is most likely
secondary to aspiration/atelectasis.
