Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-8-1**] - Mitral valve replacement (27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
Valve)and Tricuspid Valve Repair with MC3 Annuloplasty system.


History of Present Illness:
40 year-old woman, known to our service, who presented to
[**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Month (only) 205**] after waking up with shortness of
breath. She reported that was the first time she has had such an
episode, but in retrospect she probably has had increasing
dyspnea on exertion. A chest CT was done and ruled out PE. An
echocardiogram revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation and
significant pulmonary hypertension. She was referred for
surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2147-8-1**] ECHO
Pre-bypass:
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Post-bypass:
At the time of post-bypass exam, the patient is receiving
norepinephrine at 0.08 mcg/kg/min. There is a mitral valve
mechanical prothesis well-seated without paravalvular
regurgitation. Both mechanical leaflets are opening
appropriately and there are small regurgitant "washing" jets.The
mean gradient across the mitral valve is 7 mm hg with a heart
rate of 90. The tricuspid valve has a minimal transvalvular
gradient of 4 mm Hg. There is no tricuspid stenosis and mild
tricuspid regurgitation. Ventricular function is similar to
prebypass findings. The aorta is intact post decannulation. All
findings communicated with [**Month/Day/Year 5059**] at time of exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 82901**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2147-8-1**] for surgical
management of her valvular heart disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve replacement
using a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve and a tricuspid valve repair
using a MC3 annuloplasty system. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated.  She was weaned from
her pressors.  Her chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed
and she was transferred to the step down floor.  There she
experienced copious diarrhea and was found to be c.dif positive,
so oral Vancomycin was begun.  Coumadin and heparin were
initiated for her mechanical mitral valve. Warfarin was
monitored daily and dosed for a goal INR between 3.0 - 3.5.
Heparin was eventually discontinued once her INR reached above
2.0. The remainder of her postoperative course was uneventful.
Over several days she continued to make clinical improvements
with diuresis and was medically cleared for discharge to home on
postoperative day seven. INR at discharge was 4.0. Prior to
discharge, arrangements were made and confirmed with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17466**] for management of Warfarin dosing as an
outpatient.
