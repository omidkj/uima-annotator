History of Present Illness:
87 year old male with history of [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia, Complex
partial seizure, stroke, Barrett's,  Arrives with increased
confusion, responing only to sternal rub. Reportedly, patient
was just diagnosed with PNA the other day by Old Soldiers [**Name8 (MD) **]
MD. Daughter also reports loss of alertness and mobility, and
that he also had a fever of 101, and was given tylenol. Daughter
( of note HCP, as well as [**Name8 (MD) **] [**MD Number(3) 108111**] nursing facility),
reports altered MS, not taking keppra for partial tonic clonic.
Treated for PNA w/ azitha and levo.
Family also noted that he gets severe hyponatremia on any other
anti-seizure medication, but Keppra is ok.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.3 108 118/66 18 98% RA. Patient
had had a CXR, showing possible right middle lobe PNA, and was
started on Vanc/Zosyn combination.
.
He had an ABG, showing pH 7.48 pCO2-36 pO2-72 HCO3-28.
He had a CT scan of the head, with Wet read negative for
pathology
He had a CXR done showing possible PNA.
He had an EKG - unchanged to prior, with old infarct, and some
pvcs.
He was seen by neurology, who felt that the patient is likely
delirious in setting of history of LBD, now with pneumonia.
Cannot rule out ongoing seizure activity and also myoclonic
jerks noted on exam. Please change Keppra to IV if not taking PO
meds. Please get EEG. Will follow on consult service.
.
Prior to transfer, his vitals were temp 99.8 HR 80, BP 120/68 RR
22 Satting 100% on Room air.
.
On the floor, the patient only responded to voice, but was
oriented to family members and names.
.
Review of sytems: unable to ascertain, as patient is not
answering questions.

Imaging:
.
CT HEAD without contrast:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
Correlate clinically to decide on the need for further workup.
.
CXR
IMPRESSION: Increased density in the right lung base may reflect
aspiration or pneumonia in appropriate clinical circumstance
.
ECG
Sinus rhythm. Atrial premature beats and ventricular premature
beats. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2197-9-27**] the atrial and ventricular
premature
depolarizations are new. Otherwise, no other interval change.

EEG
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: The background was slow and disorganized
throughout the
recording reaching a maximum 5.5-6 Hz frequency at times.
BACKGROUND: As described above in Abnormality #1.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Stepped photic stimulation from
[**1-22**]
flashes per second (fps) produced no activation of the record.
SLEEP: No clear state changes were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A single EKG channel showed an irregular rhythm

throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a slow,
disorganized background, reaching a maximum frequency in the
theta
frequency range. This finding suggests the presence of a
moderate
encephalopathy which is non-specific in etiology but indicates
diffuse
cerebral dysfunction. No epileptiform features were seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60272**] is an 87 yo M with a history of possible [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body
dementia, autonomic dysfunction, HTN, previous CVA, who was
admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, and leukocytosis
and fevers, and evidence of pneumonia on Xray.

#Acute mental status change:  Likely secondary from infection
and hospital acquired pneumonia. Given history of seizures,
post-ictal state was considered as well but there were no
evidence of seizures on EEG.  Neurology evaluated the patient
but was confident that seizure was not occurring and that it was
not contributing to the altered mental status. We concluded that
acute delirium superimposed on chronic dementia was the most
likely cause of the altered mental status. The patient remained
somewhat somnolent throughout his stay until the last day, when
he became alert and was able to sit in a chair and eat his meal.
The patient was discharged at his baseline mental status, able
to eat and get out of bed.

#HCAP: patient admitted with leukocytosis, fever and CXR
findings consistent with pneumonia. He was treated with
Vanco/Zosyn for HCAP for 8 days. He completed his course 1 day
before discharge and remained asymptomatic.

#. HISTORY OF SEIZURES: on levitiracetam 750 mm po BID at home,
increased to 1000 mg po BID with the supervision of neurology.
EEG showed that the patient was not having any active seizures,
and patient's mental status was at baseline on discharge.

# Nutrition: During [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, his waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status made it difficult for him to consistently
eat.  His nutrition was supplanted by ensure when the
