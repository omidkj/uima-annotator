Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2174-3-14**] and underwent cardiac cath
which revealed: 50%LM [**Last Name (un) 2435**], 95% RCA [**Last Name (un) 2435**], 95% LAD [**Last Name (un) 2435**], 80% [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 8714**]
[**Last Name (un) 2435**], and 95% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2435**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and on [**2175-3-16**]
the pt. underwent CABGx3 with LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM and PDA.  Cross
clamp time was 67 mins., total bypass time was 94 mins.  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on
Propofol, Levophed, and Insulin in stable condition.  She was
extubated on POD#1 and was transferred to the floor on POD#2.
Her chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#2 and epicardial pacing wires
were d/c'd on POD#3.  She continued to slowly progress and was
discharged to rehab on POD#5 in stable condition.  Her blood
pressure was elevated and she was started on Norvasc.  Her
antihypertensives will probably need to be increased.
