Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o F who presents with AS, a. fib on coumadin at home
presents with several episodes of BRBPR this AM.
.
# Bright red blood per rectum -  GI was consulted and the
patient was admitted.  INR was reversed with vit K and FFPs.
The patient stayed hemodynamically stable although required a
total of 11 units of PRBCs to keep hct around 30.  Initial
bleeding scan was negative.  Due to continued BRBPR however, a
tagged RBC scan was repeated and showed faint/slow bleeding at
splenic flexure.  IR was called but did not feel that angio with
embolization was indicated because her hemodynamic stability and
such slow bleed.  The patient's bowel prep was continued and
underwent colonoscopy on [**2-19**] which showed multiple
diverticulosis in the left colon without bleeding.  It was
thought that the patient had diverticular bleed which stopped
spontaneously.  The day after colonoscopy, the patient did not
have any more episodes of BRBPR and was called out to the floor.
Once on the floor she remained stable, with no further bleeds,
and her hematocrit was been stable.
.
# A. fib - Coumadin was stopped and reversed with FFPs and vit
K.  The patient was continued on amiodarone but held [**Last Name (un) **] given
