Physical Exam:
Vital signs:  Temp: 94.9  BP: 76/29   P: 97  RR: 16 Oxygen sat:
97% RA
NAD, reluctanct to interact with examiner, answers some
questions; marked bitemporal wasting
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, thrush present on mucous membranes
Lungs:  Pt refused lung exam.
CV:  RRR S1 and S2 audible.  systolic murmur at RUSB
Abd: Soft, NT, ND, Pos bs, no masses.
Peripheral ext:  Left leg amputated at the knee, right leg with
black discoloration around toes, small ulceration right lower
leg.
Sacrum:  With large Stage IV decubitus ulcers with overlying
green crust, +foul odor, open areas.  Upper thighs anteriorly
with erythema, skin breakdown.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2132-8-12**], EF<25%
Conclusions:  1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
2. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.  3. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  4.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  6. Compared to the findings of
the prior study of [**2131-9-11**], left ventricular systolic function
has deteriorated.
.
[**2132-8-13**], CT Angiogram of the chest
CONCLUSION:
1. Positive study for acute pulmonary embolus involving
segmental branches in the posterior basal segment of left lower
lobe.Other area may represent a more subacute or chronic
process.

2. Large bibasilar dependent pleural effusion. Almost complete
collapse of the left lower lobe and partial atelectasis of the
dependent portion of right lower lobe.

3. Central line and endotracheal tube are in good position. Some
nonocclusive (likely mucus) noted in the left central airways.

.
[**2132-8-18**] CXR An orogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. A
left PICC line terminates in the left axilla, a left internal
jugular vascular catheter terminates at the junction of the
superior vena cava and right atrium, and an endotracheal tube is
in satisfactory position. The heart size is normal. Bilateral
pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left
are again demonstrated. Previously present perihilar haziness
has resolved in the interval and the cardiac silhouette appears
smaller, likely due to improving volume status of the patient.
.
RIGHT ANKLE 3 VIEWS [**2132-8-14**]:  RIGHT ANKLE, THREE VIEWS:
Comparison is made to prior study dated [**2132-6-26**]. Again
seen are fractures of the distal tibia and fibula with mild
impaction of the tibial component. There is evidence of interval
callus formation, although fracture lines remain conspicuous.
There is asymmetry about the ankle mortise. There is severe
diffuse osteopenia and extensive vascular calcifications. There
is no gross osseous destruction. No subcutaneous gas is
identified.
IMPRESSION: Mild interval healing of distal tibial and fibular
fractures as above in the setting of severe diffuse osteopenia.
