Micro:
Bld [**2-1**]- GNR

CXR ([**2-1**])Marked interval worsening of congestive heart failure
when
compared with prior exam of one day earlier.

ECHO: ([**1-23**]) :Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly focally thickened. There is moderate focal
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
52M with Crohn's c/b short gut syndrome, s/p ileostomy, on
chronic TPN with multiple line infections in the past admitted
with GNR bacteremia with hospital course c/b ARDS/intubation.

Once admitted, he was found to have [**2-22**] blood cultures (+) for
GNR; presumed source unclear but possibilities included
in-dwelling line vs. pneumonia vs. translocation of bacteria
from gut.

On admission had been hypoxic in the low 90s. ABG showed pH 7.43
pCO2  29 pO2 59 HCO3 20.

Hypoxia was initially thought to be due to mild CHF (by hx,
exam, CXR); he received lasix 20 mg IV x 1 with mild improvement
of symptoms. Despite improvement in sx, pt continued to remain
hypoxic/tachypneic throughout the day, with O2 sats falling into
the 80s on 40% face mask. Patient was put on a NRB and f/u ABG
showed pH 7.43 pCO2 33 pO2 91 HCO3 23. Portable CXR showed
worsening diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of ARDS.
Intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with vent settings initially on AC
TV500/rate16/PEEP5/FIO2 100%, sedated with propofol gtt.

He was intubated for possible ARDS on [**2-1**]. Bld cultures grew
enterobacter. The source was unclear but possibilities included
line infection or bacterial gut translocation.  He is being
treated with Levofloxacin for Enterobacter Sepsis. His Hickman
was removed and a temp line placed on [**2196-2-4**]. He was
successfully extubated [**2-8**]. He was continued on nebulizers
(given his underlying COPD). He had a bump in his chronic
elevation of cholestatic liver enzymes and RUQ was normal.

1. Enterobacter bacteremia: Source thought to be line sepsis, as
per past h/o polymicrobial line infections, although
translocation of bacteria from gut was also entertained given
patient's history of Crohn's with friable mucosa.  The
enterobacter from his blood cultures was pan-sensitive.  He was
treated with a 10 day course of levofloxacin.  Given patient's
past history of mitral valve [**Month/Year (2) **], he underwent a TEE in
setting of bacteremia to r/o seeding of his valve, which was
negative.  Patient's Hickman was removed, and catheter tip did
not grow any bugs in culture.  He had a new line placed by IR on
[**2196-2-12**].

2. Chronic vertebral osteomyelitis: Pt was continued on
vancomycin for chronic Staph epi osteo of the c-spine at C4-C5.

3. ARDS-Patient developed progressive respiratory distress and
hypoxia in the setting of his GNR bacteremia, with CXR c/w ARDS.
 Pt has had a h/o ARDS in the setting of infection in the past.
He was intubated for one week and was weaned without difficulty,
with no further complications (pulmonary infection/long term
ventilation requiring tracheostomy as in the past).

4. Crohn's disease: Patient is s/p multiple surgeries with short
gut and an ileostomy on chronic TPN.  His TPN was restarted
after his Hickman was removed and a temporary line was placed.
He was continued on his home regimen of loperamide/DTO.

5. Acute on CRF: Patient initially had an elevated creatinine to
2.1, up from 1.3 to 1.4 at baseline.  Etiology was thought ?
toxicity from gentamicin given in the ED for GNR bacteremia
versus a pre-renal state from volume depletion in setting of
fevers/infection and increased insensible losses.  His renal
function returned to baseline by the end of his hospitalization.

6. Diastolic CHF: TTE performed [**2-2**] shows impaired relaxation
consistent with diastolic dysfunction.  Also noted was mitral
regurgitation, although this was 4+ in the past, and is now 2+
with an eccentric jet (TTE [**2-2**]).  EF unchanged.  Pt may benefit
from afterload reduction in the setting of his MR, although his
