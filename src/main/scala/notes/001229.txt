Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, hypotension, diarrhea, and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line

History of Present Illness:
53yo female with a history of asthma presents with abdominal
pain, hypotension, and fever.
.
Approximately 2 weeks ago, patient developed dysuria and low
abdominal pain. She describes her abdominal pain as being sharp
in character, located in the right side of her abdomen, without
radiations, and without any clear exacerbators or relievers.
This was thought secondary to a urinary tract infection, and she
was treated wtih a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin. Her dysuria
resolved, but her abdominal pain persisted. At the same time,
she was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis for which she was
treated with metronidazole. After completing her course of
ciprofloxacin, she was subsequently diagnosed with a yeast
infection for which she was treated with a topical antifungal
medication. Then approximately 2 days ago, she developed fevers
and chills with a Tmax of 102.7 on this day of admission.
Additional symptoms include right-sided low back pain, nausea,
generalized abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea which started on
the day of admission. On additional review of systems, she
denies recent travel, sick contacts, or dietary changes. She is
in a monogamous relationship with her male partner of three
years. Has a possible history of chlamydia but no other STDs
that she is aware of. Her last menstrual period was in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2179**] and was previously regular.
.
She initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where her vital
signs were 90/54, HR 109, RR 22, Pulse ox 98% RA. She received
dilaudid .5mg IV x 1, morphine 4mg IV x 2, phenergan 12.5mg IV x
2, tylenol 650mg PO x 1, zofran 4mg IV x 2. She had pelvic US
and CT Abd/Pelvis that demonstrated ovarian cyst. She received
zosyn x 1. Upon arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, temp 99.9, HR 80, BP
78/44, RR 20, and pulse ox 98% on room air. Her exam was notable
for mild RLQ and LLQ tenderness. Labs were notable for a normal
WBC at 8.5, hematocrit at 34, contaminated UA with 11-20 epis.
She received 2L NS with improvement in her BP from 70s to 80s.
She also received metronidazole 500mg IV x 1 and zofran 2mg IV x
2. OB-gyn was consulted, and she was thought to have likely C.
diff colitis and recommended treatment for C. diff. Her ovarian
cysts were thought likely benign. Surgery was consulted and
recommended broad spectrum coverage with vanc / zosyn / flagyl
and consideration of a repeat CT scan with oral and IV contrast.

.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she describes her abdominal pain as
[**2181-4-12**] in pain, sharp and crampy in character, located in her
lower abdomen. Her primary complaint is her frequent loose and
watery stools.

Brief Hospital Course:
53yo female with a history of asthma and s/p
choledocalcystectomy presents with hypotension, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, fever.
.
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The pt's hypotension was likely secondary
to sepsis or severe volume depletion from C difficile.  Of note
patient is normally in low 90s systolic.  Pt's systolics were in
the 80s most of her first evening in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no changes in
mental status.  She was bolused with LRs.  The next morning she
dropped her SBP to 66 but was mentating fine and responded to 2L
of LR.  After aggressive volume resuscitation, her BP have now
been stable on the floor.  SBP 100s range (i.e. at her
baseline), mentating well and feeling well.

2. C diff: Likely related to antibiotic use, reports she was
given recent antibiotic course x 10 days for UTI.  Pt was
febrile in the ED and had symptoms of sepsis and severe volume
depletion.  Her WBC was normal at [**Hospital1 **] but elevated at an OSH.
Patient stool came back positive for c. diff x2.  She was
started on IV flagyl and oral vancomycin.  She is doing well on
oral regimen with decreased bowel movements to 3-4 per day,
taking good po's.  She will complete 2 week course po
vancomycin.  She plans to discuss with her local providers her
hx of UTIs -- she understandably is wary of future antibiotics
for UTIs.  I informed her that though I don't have her outpt
records, generally uncomplicated bladder infections should be ~3
day course antibiotics, longer if there are symptoms of
pyelonephritis.  Recommmended that urine cultures be checked
when she has dysuria in the future to confirm that she actually
has an infection.

3. Asthma Stable and under adequate control.  Patient was
continued on home regimen.
.
4. Anemia: The etiology of her anemia is unclear in our records
but is chronic per pt.  Her HCT has been stable here and she has
not required transfusion.  She has known iron deficiency and her
iron should be restarted after she completes her course of
flagyl.
.
5. Ovarian cyst: pt reports she has known cyst and we recommend
f/u with her PCP and gynecologist for this.  She was given a
copy of her abdominal CT report.
