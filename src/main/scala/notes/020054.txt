[**2144-9-18**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggestive of hemoperitoneum with site of active
contrast
extravasation within a new hematoma within the left upper
quadrant of the
abdomen. Recommend dedicated arterial and delayed
contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen for further
characterization.
2. Worsened pancreatitis from most recent imaging by MRCP on
[**2144-9-9**] with
interval development of multiple peripancreatic fluid
collections compatible with pseudocysts. There is no evidence of
pancreatic necrosis and no pseudoaneurysms or thromboses are
identified in the peripancreatic
vasculature.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged from MRCP on
[**2144-9-9**] but new
from the CT on [**2144-9-3**].
4. Colonic and sigmoid diverticula with no evidence of
diverticulitis.
5. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
6. Hemoperitoneum with a site of active extravasation identified
within a
hematoma in the left upper quadrant.

[**2144-9-22**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of a component of a complex pseudocyst, with
increased
internal density, findings that are consistent with continued
interval
hemorrhage within a pseudocyst. However, the previously
demonstrated active extravasation is no longer visualized.
This finding discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2144-9-22**] via
telephone at the time of dictation, approximately 4:30 PM.
2. Findings consistent with post-pancreatitis change including
multiple
peripancreatic pseudocysts. No evidence of definitive pancreatic
necrosis.
3. Findings consistent with colitis, likely reactive.
4. IVC filter in place. Phase of contrast administration limits
assessment
for patency of the IVC.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased on the right.


[**2144-9-17**] LENI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Non-occlusive thrombus the right superficial femoral and
popliteal veins.
2. No DVT in the left leg.






Brief Hospital Course:
The patient, who was recently discharge ([**9-14**]) after 11 days
hospitalization secondary to acute pancreatitis and RRR PE, was
readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with recurrent abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting. The patient was started on Coumadin/Lovenox during
last admission for PE treatment. On admission, patient's INR =
2.3, HCT = 35.9, Amylase 55 and Lipase = 65. CT scan revealed
hemoperitoneum with a site of active extravasation identified
within a hematoma in the left upper quadrant, worsened
pancreatitis and colonic and sigmoid diverticula with no
evidence of diverticulitis. The patient's Lovenox and Coumadin
was discontinued. On [**2144-9-17**], the patient underwent IVC filter
placement and placed in ICU to continue care. On [**2144-9-18**] (HD #
2), the patient's HCT fell down to 20.6, he received 3 units of
pRBC, post transfusion HCT 27.6. INR was 2.7, patient was given
2 units of FFP and Vit K, INR down to 2.0. On HD # 3 ([**2144-9-19**]),
patient receive 2 u of RBC for HCT 23.4 and 1 unit of FFP for
INR 2.1, post transfusion HCT 26.9, INR 1.8. Nutrition consult
was called and TPN was started on HD # 3 via R IJ. On HD # 2,
patient's WBC was 49.1, he was pan cultured and started on broad
spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Flagyl and Ceftriaxone). On HD
# 5, patient was stable (HCT 26, INR 1.5, WBC 15.0), the patient
was transferred on the floor NPO, TPN, and antibiotics, with a
foley catheter, and Dilaudid IV for pain control.  The patient
was hemodynamically stable.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid IV with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: Chest radiograph revealed small bilateral pleural
effusions on admission. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation
and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout
hospitalization. The patient remained stable from pulmonary
standpoint.
GI/GU: The patient was made NPO with IV fluids on admission. TPN
