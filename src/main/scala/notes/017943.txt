HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female who was seen in the Emergency Room on 88-28 for
hyperkalemia with a potassium of 6.2.  An EKG at that time
showed minor T wave peaking and a potassium of 5.9.  The
patient was now sent from her nursing home to the Emergency
Room for evaluation of new increase in BUN and creatinine to
70 and 2.5 respectively and an increase in her white blood
cell count to 29 and one day of lethargy and a temperature to
99.  In the Emergency Room her temperature was 100.2, blood
pressure 97/48, she was given 4 liters of normal saline and
her blood pressure improved to 111/74.  She was also given
Vancomycin, Ampicillin, Gentamycin and Flagyl.
Neo-Synephrine drip was started and an arterial line was
placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for MRSA urinary tract
infection, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes,
dementia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure,
pulmonary embolus and osteoarthritis.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Digoxin 0.125 mg, Coumadin,
Colace, Insulin, Prevacid, Tylenol, Zoloft, Lasix, Vasotec,
Aspirin, Lopressor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient weighed 110 lbs, heart
rate was 137, blood pressure 95-122/20-46 and her respiratory
rate was 16-29.  She was satting greater than 90% on three
liters nasal cannula.  She was on a Neo-Synephrine drip.  She
was pleasantly disoriented.  Her jugular venous pressure was
at 8 cm.  Her oropharynx was dry.  Her lungs revealed coarse
rales, left greater than right.  Heart was tachycardic with
normal S1 and S2.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender, non
distended with no bowel sounds.  She had 1+ edema in her
legs.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 29, hematocrit
30 and platelet count 399,000 with a differential of 94%
polymorphonucleocytes, 3% lymphs and 1% monos.  Her
chemistries revealed a sodium of 147 and a potassium of 3.9,
chloride 112, CO2 17, BUN 47 and creatinine 3.8 and glucose
179 with anion gap of 18.  Chest x-ray revealed a left lower
lobe consolidation.  Urine cultures from her previous ER
visit had grown proteus mirabilis.  Blood cultures were
pending on admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit where she was supported with Neo-Synephrine and
continued with antibiotics for her hypotension.  An
echocardiogram was read as showing decreased right
ventricular systolic function and a normal ejection fraction
and no major changes from previous echocardiogram.  An EKG
showed no change from previous.  The patient's blood cultures
grew out gram negative rods in [**3-9**] bottles and her urine
cultures grew out proteus.  The patient's code status had
been in question on admission since she was DNR, DNI at the
nursing home but her brother had wanted her to be a full code
on admission.  On [**8-7**] the house staff was called as the
patient had gone into asystolic and respiratory arrest.  The
patient was found unresponsive and with no pulse and no
respirations. The patient's brother was [**Name (NI) 653**] and it was
decided not to resuscitate her.  The patient's time of death
was 11:02 on [**2157-8-7**] secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest and
urosepsis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Renal failure.
3.  Dementia.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Type 2 diabetes.
