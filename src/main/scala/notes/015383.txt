Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 9700**] is a 70 y.o. male that had left lower extremity
ischemia and arrived at the pre-op holding on [**2127-2-20**] for a
fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass.  The patient's operating had a large amount of
blood loss (roughly 2L).  He was taken to the PACU where the
patient had continued hypotension.  He was given two units of
blood, and was started on albumin and crystalloid.  He was
started on pressors.  He was then transferred to the ICU where
the patient had continued hypotension.  He was given another
unit of blood, more crystlloid, and albumin.  The patient was
continued on pressors until [**2127-2-22**].  He was transferred to the
floor on [**2127-2-23**].  The patient continued to require fluid
boluses for resucitation purposes for hypotension.

On [**2127-2-24**], the patient triggered for hypotension that did not
respond to a fluid bolus.  The patient's BP was systolic of 70s
non-responsive to fluid bolus.  He continued to have adequate
urine output, and he continued to mentate well.  He was given
one unit of PRBCs.  His blood pressure continued in the mid-80s,
low 90s.  His ACE inhibitor and HCTZ continued to be held.

On [**2-25**], physical therapy worked with the patient, and he was
found to be tachycardic (140s) when walking.  His ACE inhibitor
and HCTZ continued to be held.

On [**2-26**], the patient's foley and JP drained were pulled.  He
continued to be tachycardic with physical therapy, and the
patient was given a bolus of albumin followed by IV lasix as he
was still above his admission weight.

On [**2-27**], the patient's HCTZ was restarted.  Physical therapy
cleared the patient to go home.

On [**2-28**], the patient was discharged to home with services, with
vital signs stable. The upper pole of the incision is draining
serous fluid, to have dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] and as needed.  Will
FU w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3236**] as planned.
