using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire
Normal cholangiogram
Normal pancreatogram
Balloon sweep was performed, no stones or sludge noted

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F w/ h/o COPD on 3-4L of oxygen, h/o pancreaitis and
presumed ascending cholangitis who was treated previoiusly at
OSH and left AMA without ERCP who presented here for ERCP
[**2176-1-31**] that found severe stenosis of the major papilla s/p
sphinterotomy.  She was admitted to the medical service for
observation, given her poor baseline respiratory and functional
status.  She then developed epigastric pain and SOB after the
procedure.  The patient was a poor historian but said that she
was symptom free prior to her ERCP and the epigastric abdominal
pain was new.  She said the pain was similar to prior episodes
of pancreatitis, and denied radiation or alleviating or
exacerbating factors.  Over the course of the evening, she
spiked a fever to 102.  The next morning, she was noted to have
an increasing leukocytosis to 15.  She was given Cipro/Flagyl
due to her allergy to PCN and cephalosporins, and later
Vancomycin was added.   The patient stated that her abdominal
pain was [**9-11**] and unlike any pain that she has ever had.  She
denied nausea or vomiting.  She became increasingly tachycardic
to the 110s with one episode of desaturation to 80% briefly
requiring a non-rebreather.  Given these new findings, HPB
surgery service was consulted and she was transferred to the
TSICU on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].

[**2176-2-1**]:
On Dilaudid for pain however was still diffusely tender.  HR
controlled w/ beta-blocker (Rate control <100).  Pulmonary
status was stable overall, received stress dose steroids for
COPD exacerbation, encouraged IS and written for Nebs PRN.  Her
NGT was advanced into stomach to continue decompression, NPO
status.  Foley was intact w/ adequate urine output. Urine &
Blood cx were pending.  She was started on vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole.

[**2176-2-2**]:
Had low UOP in AM, given 5% albumin x 1, UOP improved ~30 cc/hr;
abd exam unchanged w/ persistent TTP, +rebound, guarding.  She
had desaturations to 80's in evening w/ increased work of
breathing, and worsening respiratory acidosis.  This was
attributed to a COPD exacerbation.  Given her DNR/DNI code
status, SICU intensivist and team spoke w/ the patient
extensively early on regarding the potential for intubation.
The patient initially did not want to discuss code status and
potential intubation when she was in moderate respiratory
distress.  However, when her respiratory status worsened despite
medical therapy she was agreeable to being intubated.  She was
intubated without complication and placed on CMV, a R IJ CVL and
a-line were placed as well.  However, she became dissynchronous
w/ ventilator and required paralyzation.  She also developed
Afib w/ RVR, placed on diltiazem gtt and was rate controlled.
NICOM was placed and she was found to be euvolemic but still had
low UOP ~20cc/hr.  Cr slightly elevated to 1.3.

[**2176-2-3**]:
Continued paralysis for ventilator. Given albumin bolus with NS
and weaned from pressors.  Weaned off dilt gtt, converted to
metoprolol IV q6h. Had one episode of hypotension to the 80s
overnight, given IVF bolus with albumin.  Still no resolution of
hypotension, restarted on low dose neo with improvement in BP.
Pt's Cr also rising, found to be prerenal by FeUrea, started on
maintenance fluids. Plts decreased significantly, 135->45,
unclear etiology, sent HIT antibody. Consider vancomycin as a
cause as well.  Stress dose steroids continued.  NGT was removed
and replaced with OGT for decompression.  Continued stress ulcer
prophylaxis with IV PPI.

[**2176-2-4**]: Poor UOP, no response to Lasix 20, given Lasix 80 with
better UOP. IVF held, Updated daughter, sister during visit
today.  Weaned paralysis and sedation, weak but responsive.
Weaned to CPAP. Overnight, required increasing FiO2 to maintain
O2Sat>90. Evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Episode of a-fib,
on dilt gtt, with increasing Neo requirement. Platelets 11, very
concerning now for HIT, SQH held.

[**2176-2-5**]:  Pain controlled with midaz for sedation.  Persistent
afib, dilt gtt at 10, Neo weaned to keep MAP >65.  Plan for
return to home steroid dose 3/6.  Blood cultures pending.
Family meeting held. Discussed potential benefits and
difficulties with surgical resection and risk of mortality,
prolonged recovery, and likely need for long term respiratory
and nutrition support. Decision reached to make patient's status
comfort measures only


[**2176-2-6**]: Comfort measures only: extubated with family at bedside.
 Intermittend dilaudid for pain, ativan for anxiety.  Pressors,
dilt gtt, antibiotics discontinued.  Fluids discontinued.  RIJ
and Foley kept for medication acc
