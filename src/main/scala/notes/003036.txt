History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old woman with a history of Afib s/p
ablation,HTN,DM, spinal stenosis, with recent hospitalization
for osteomyelitis who presents with altered mental status and
worsening tremor.  She had been discharged from [**Hospital1 **] following
hospitalization from presumed sepsis and hypotension on [**2125-11-5**]
to rehab. On the evening of [**11-9**] a moonlighter was called for
increasing agitation. It is unclear at what point she  received
0.5mg of ativan. The patient was confused (oriented x1) with  a
question of increasing tremor and possibly slurred speech and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for concern of seizures v. sepsis with
AMS.
.
In ED tachy to 110s, SBP 110s and required a  0.7L fluid bolus
with resolution of BP to 130s, but remained tachy to low 100s. A
CT ab/pelvis revealed a fluid collection on her left flank. No
PE was noted. She continued to receive Vanc/flagyl and got a
dose of zosyn, with admission for further work up.
.
ROS was negative for chest pain, syncope or presyncope,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. Patient did not have any other complaints. She reported
that her tremor has been present since she was in her 20s,
related to a medication effect.
.
This am on the floor she was intermittently oriented to place
and month but sometimes thinking she was stranded without her
car and needing help.  She did complain of anxiety once, calling
for help, and was verbally calmed down then noted to be
tachycardic to the 140s. Cardiology was consulted, with carotid
massage x 2 performed, with return to normal sinus rythm.

[**Name (NI) **] son notes that her speech is significantly more
garbled in the last two to three days than previously. She began
to have difficulty speaking status post extubation during the
previous ICU stay, but her speech has become progressively
worse. He confirms that the patient has had a baseline tremor,
thought to be due to a medication effect 20 years ago. By the
time the son visited the patient in the late morning, her tremor
had improved, though it did intermittently worsen when the
patient became more anxious.  Son also noted that pt had
intermittently stared off into space and been less responsive
for a few minutes, then would return to conversation.

Pertinent Results:
============
Radiology
============

CT Torso [**11-9**]
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
2. 2.2 x 2.0 cm fluid and air collection in the subcutaneous
tissues of the
left lateral abdominal wall that could reflect post-operative
seroma, but
abscess cannot be excluded.
3. No evidence large fluid collection surrounding spinal
fixation hardware in the lumbar spine, although artifact
obscures fine detail and evaluation is suboptimal.
4. Cirrhotic liver with ascites.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small
on the right
with adjacent atelectasis.
6. Atherosclerotic disease.

CT Head [**11-10**]
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient motion. Within this
limitation, no
acute intracranial abnormalities identified.

Repeat study [**11-10**]
Several rounded areas of hypodensity are seen within the left
frontal region seen on axial images only that are likely areas
of volume averaging, however, peripheral areas of infarction
cannot be entirely excluded, and if of clinical concern, a
repeat examination or MR can be
performed. No evidence of hemorrhage.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite acute infarction.
2. Mild-to-moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles, with
features as described above and slightly out of proportion to
the prominence of the cerebral sulci; while this can relate to
volume loss, associated communicating hydrocephalus/NPH cannot
be completely excluded. To correlate clinically

============
Neurology
============
EEG [**11-13**]
This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states.
Note is made by technician of intermittent left leg shaking
without obvious epileptiform discharges or EEG correlate seen
during that time. Due to technical difficulties, video was
unavailable for review. No focal, lateralized, or epileptiform
features were noted during this recording. Note is made of a
tachycardia of 108 bpm in a single EKG channel.

24 hour EEG [**11-18**]
This 24 hour video EEG telemetry capture no electrographic
seizures. There were no clear focal or lateralizing epileptiform
features. The background showed a slightly disorganized alpha
theta rhythm which would be normal for advanced age.

===========
Cytology
============
Pleural fluids [**11-14**]
 	 NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

============
Cardiology
============

Stress test [**11-12**]
 No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes to
pharmacologic stress. Appropriate blood pressure response with
flat
heart rate response to Persantine infusion. Nuclear report sent
separately.

TTE [**11-14**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the basal half of the inferior wall and mid-inferior septum and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-5**],
regional left ventricular systolic function is now improved. The
