Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
"Weakness all over my body"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10/2162**]: Vtach/vfib arrest s/p cardioversion now on chronic
amiodarone therapy
[**2162-10-25**]: Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.
[**2162-10-25**]: Open tracheostomy tube placement.
[**2162-10-29**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration

Ultrafiltration with removal of 18L of fluid

History of Present Illness:
84 yo male with multiple medical problems, including
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD, and history of CVA's
who presented to the ED with a 24 history of weakness, cough,
SOB and nausea. He denied fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal
pain. Emesis x 1 that AM. In ED he was found to be hypoxemic w/
sats 85% on RA, pulmonary edema on CXR and SBP in the 80's. On
presentation, however, the patient was alert and oriented,
appropriate and mentating well. He initially received 2L NS for
IVF hydration, as well as antibiotics including ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, vancomycin for suspected community acquired
pneumonia. The patient then went into rapid afib with HR in the
140's. He was given 5 mg Lopressor IV and his HR decreased to
100. However, the patient's respiratory status declined
precipitously and his sats dipped to 86% on a 100% face mask. He
was placed on a nonrebreather and subsequently intubated in the
setting of impending respiratory failure. Peri-intubation the
patient again became hypotensive with SBP in the 80-60's and was
started on dopamine and dilt for rate control. After intubation
and central line placement, the patient was transferred to the
MICU and admitted with a running diagnosis of sepsis caused by
an underlying community acquired pneumonia.

Although the patient had a extensive medical history and problem
list, prior to presentation and subsequent admission to the
hospital he was fairly independent and ambulatory, living at
home with his wife.

Pertinent Results:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2162-10-4**] 1:24 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Bilateral large pleural effusions with bibasilar
collapse/consolidation.
3. Multiple hepatic cysts.

TTE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-4**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened with the
posterior
leaflet be calcified and prolapsing. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2158-5-2**], left ventricular systolic function may have
decreased.

TEE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-6**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%)
(intinsic LV systolic function may be depressed given the
severity of mitral regurgitation). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There is partial
posterior mitral leaflet flail. There is a echodense mass on the
posterior leaflet consistent with probable old vegetation on the
mitral valve; small mobile echodense mass is associated that may
represent a possible new vegetation. Eccentric, anteriorly
directed, moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valves.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Probable old (healed) mitral valve vegetation;
cannot exclude
small superimposed new vegetation. Mitral valve prolapse with
partial flail of the posterior leaflet and moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation. Mild to moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation.
Normal biventricular systolic function (LVEF 60-70%)(intrinisic
LV systolic function may be depressed given the severity of
mitral regurgitation).

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-10**]
Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but
cannot be quantified. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)of [**2162-10-6**], there is no significant change

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-1**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. Mitral regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2162-10-10**], the mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet is more
prominent. This may
represent a flailed mitral valve leaflet with chordae or it may
represent a vegetation. If the mass is a vegetation, and because
this mass appears
calcified, this mass might be a healed vegetation. The mitral
regurgitation is hard to quantify in this present study.

TEE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-3**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
