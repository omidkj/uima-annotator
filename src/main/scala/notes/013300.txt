Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall from outside hospital


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
 Pt is a 76 year old male with PMH of PUD ([**12-4**]), CAD s/p MI 4
weeks ago (medically managed), ESRD on HD, AFib, COPD, HTN,
dementia, who presented initially to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH on [**2168-9-7**]
following a mechanical fall which resulted in fracture of C1-2
and R shoulder fracture.  Pt was initially admitted to Trauma
service for monitering, then transferred to neurosurgery
service.
Pt was stable neurologically and stable on floor until [**2168-9-14**]
when pt returned from dialysis and had hematemesis of coffee
ground emesis.  He also had some grossly melenotic stool.  He
quickly developed AFib with RVR to 120's-130's, did not respond
to IV lopressor, transient response to IV diltiazem.  BP
remained stable and slightly elevated with SBP 140-170s.  Could
not assess O2 sat acurately.  Labs taken acutely at this time
notable for normal Hct at 46.1, and elevated WBC to 25.5.  GI
was notified, pt ordered for pRBC, OG tube was placed and pt was
transferred to MICU for further care and monitering.
Of note, hospital course otherwise notable for failed speech and
swallow evaluation w/ gross aspiration on [**9-13**].

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-9-8**] 7:18 AM

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for potential stroke

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with ? evolving stroke on CT
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for potential stroke
INDICATIONS: 76-year-old man with question of stroke.

COMPARISONS: CT from [**2168-2-16**].

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the brain
was performed. An MR angiogram of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was also
performed with three-dimensional time-of-flight weighted
imaging.

FINDINGS: There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus or shift of the
normally midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns and sulci
are all similarly prominent, consistent with atrophic change.
There are numerous bilateral cerebral foci of white matter
hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging, consistent with chronic
small vessel ischemic disease. There are no areas of restricted
diffusion, however, to suggest recent infarction. There are two
focal regions of susceptibility artifact outlining the sulci
along the left temporal convexity, most likely due to siderosis
associated with prior subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is no
indication of recent intracranial hemorrhage, however.

MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: There are no areas of
stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation. The internal carotid and
basilar arteries, and their branches, show appropriate
anterograde flow.

IMPRESSION:
1. Similar atrophic changes.

2. Extensive foci of hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging, most
suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

3. No evidence of recent infarction.

4. Likely siderosis along the left temporal convexity, probably
due to old subarachnoid hemorrhage.

These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7356**] on [**2168-9-9**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA BILAT  [**2168-9-7**] 5:42 PM

SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLA; ELBOW (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGH

Reason: fractures

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man s/p fall from standing with bilateral humeral
head fractures
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
fractures
INDICATION: 76-year-old man status post fall with bilateral
humeral head fractures.

BILATERAL SHOULDERS, FOUR VIEWS: Limited views secondary to
technique and patient positioning. There is a minimally
displaced fracture through the surgical neck of the humerus.
There is no evidence of dislocation. The surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The left humeral head
appears intact. No fracture is identified, although the gleoid
is not well evaluated. There is no evidence of dislocation on
these two views, but again, an axial view was not obtained. The
surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures show swelling
about the right shoulder and minimal left acromio- clavicular
joint degenerative changes.

RIGHT ELBOW, THREE VIEWS: Limited views secondary to technique.
There is no evidence of a fracture, malalignment, or significant
soft tissue abnormality including effusion.

IMPRESSION: Limited views as described above. Minimally
displaced right humeral head fracture through the surgical neck.
No evidence of joint dislocation. Right shoulder soft tissue
swelling. No definite fracture identified within the left
humeral head or right elbow.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-9-7**] 5:25 PM

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: s/p fall

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p fall
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post fall, neck pain.

CT CERVICAL SPINE: [**Location (un) 5621**]-type comminuted minimally displaced
fracture of the C1 ring is identified. Horizontal fracture of
the body of the odontoid is also seen, with minimal anterior
widening. No other fractures are identified. Minimal soft tissue
swelling is seen. There are extensive degenerative changes of
the cervical s
