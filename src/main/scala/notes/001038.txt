Pertinent Results:
Pt. had a spike in WBC to 17.9 with a left shift on [**6-7**] which
subsequently decreased to 12.0 on discharge with resolution of L
shift.
.
Upon admission ([**6-6**]), BUN/Creat were elevated to 31/1.5 which
subsequently decreased with treatment to normal limits (9/0.7).
Potassium on [**6-6**] was 8.5 and decreased to normal limits by
discharge.
.
Troponin-T ranged from 0.17 to 0.10.
.
Stool studies showed WBCs, but was negative for all of the
following: C.dif, O+P, Salmonella and Shigella.
.
Urine cx showed no growth, blood cx: ******
.
EKG ([**6-13**])Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular response 116.
Since [**2131-6-11**] atrial fibrillation is now seen. The inferior T
wave inversions are
less prominent. The Q-T interval is shortened. Increased ST-T
wave abnormalities are noted
.
CXR: ([**6-6**])IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CTA Head ([**6-12**]):
IMPRESSION:
1) Occlusion of the entire visualized superior left internal
carotid artery and left middle cerebral artery.  The left
anterior cerebral artery is supplied from the right via the
ACOM.  Obscuration of the left putamen
consistent with evolving left MCA infarction.  No evidence of
acute
intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic transformation.  Findings
discussed
immediately with the neurology team, and an MRA with Gadolinium
of the neck was suggested to evaluate the more proximal carotid
system.
2) Short segment stenosis of the left posterior cerebral artery.

3) Scattered chronic small vessel ischemic disease in the white
matter and
chronic right thalamic lacune.
.
MRA/MRI Head/Neck ([**6-12**]):
IMPRESSION:
1) Evolving infarction involving the left putamen, caudate body,
corona
radiata, and medial aspect of the left temporal lobe.
2) Occlusion of the distal left cervical ICA, with two probable
areas of high-grade stenosis in the proximal left cervical ICA,
though the latter would be far better assessed with a gadolinium
enhanced study, and if the patient is able to tolerate such, a
repeat study with gadolinium is recommended.
.
Echocardiogram ([**6-14**]):Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. There is normal systolic function of
the remaining segments. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

 .
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
 .
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-12-12**],
mitral
regurgitation severity has increased and pulmonary pressures are
higher. The other findings are similar.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Uniform, circumferential bowel wall thickening involving the
descending colon, sigmoid and rectum, concerning for an
inflammatory or infectious etiology. Rectal involvement make
ischemic etiology less likely.

2. Multiple hypodensities within the kidneys, too small to
characterize.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the MICU for monitoring of
BRBPR. Her HCT fell from 42.8-- 34-- 29 over 20 hours (baseline
28-32). The patient was evaluated by GI and felt to have an
ischemic vs. infectious proctocolitis. She was given
levo/flagyl, IV ppi, 2L LR. Kayexelate was held as the patient
was having diarrhea and no peaked t's.  She remained stable
throughout her MICU course, she was given 1 unit of blood, she
remained afebrile with stable vitals and was transferred out to
the floor the following day.
.
On the floor her GI sx shortly resolved with levo/flagyl, and
her pain was adequately controlled. She had a run of atrial
fibrillation with RVR that responded to IV Diltizem and returned
to sinus. This recurred once again during her stay and again
converted to sinus after IV Dilt. and was maintained on po
metoprolol.
.
On the morning of [**6-12**] she was found to have a new right sided
facial droop and R sided hemiparesis as well as aphasia.  A
stroke alert was called, the patient was given aspirin and
underwent urgent CT/CTA of the head which showed a L sided
carotid occlusion and evolving area of infarction in the L
internal capsule.  There was no bleed.  MRI/MRA confirmed these
findings.  Due to the unclear time of onset of symptoms,
thrombolysis was not performed.  In addition, due to the
patient's history of bleeding and risk of hemorrhagic
transformation of the infarction, heparin was not given.
Coumadin was started on [**6-14**] due to discovery of paroxysmal Afib
to prevent future embolic events.
.
The patient remained stable throughout the remainder of the
hospital course.  Speech/swallow eval determined that she was in
fact globally aphasic, and recommended pureed foods and nectars.
 On the days of discharge she was afebrile, displaying normal
vital signs (sinus rhythm) and tolerating po with assistance.
