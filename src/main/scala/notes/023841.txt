Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Status post mitral valvuloplasty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 73 year old man with complicated past medical
history including large B cell non-hodgkins lymphoma, mitral
stenosis, Afib, seizure disorder, electively admitted for
valvuloplasty, transferred to CCU for close monitoring.
.
Briefly, patient was admitted on [**10-14**] with SOB and DOE and was
evaluated for valvuloplasty, however at that time was found to
have a clot in the right atrium and procedure was deferred. He
remained anticoagulated and repeat TEE yesterday revealed
persistent left atrial appendage clot with smoke. Became
hypotensive during the procedure and was given 2L IV fluids,
thought to be multifactorial from poor PO intake, sedation, and
afib with RVR. Today, he underwent planned mitral vavuloplasty
uneventfully with improvement in mitral valve area from 1.2 to
3.7 cm2 (gradient decreased from 10 to 2 mmHg); cardiac index
was 2.5 L/min/m2; mean PCWP 17 mmHg with LVEDP 9 mmHg. He
currently has no complaints.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

[**12-24**] ECHO:
The left atrium is severely dilated. Mild to moderate
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). Definite thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
normal (LVEF>55%) (not fully assessed). Right ventricular free
wall motion may be depressed. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly to moderately thickened. The
mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. The
mitral stenosis gradient was not assessed. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. A TEE procedure related complication occurred (see
comments for details).
.
IMPRESSION: Left atrial appendage thrombus with prominent
spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium and left atrial
appendage. Mitral stenosis with rheumatic deformity.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-10-28**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced on the current
study. The other findings are similar.
.
[**12-14**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation may be due
to left anterior fascicular block. Precordial lead QRS
configuration may be due to
left anterior fascicular block but consider also right
ventricular
overload/hypertrophy. The QTc interval appears prolonged but it
is difficult to measure. ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of
[**2196-10-28**] no significant change.
.
[**12-16**] ECHO (pre-procedure):The left atrium is dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is normal right ventricular free wall contractility. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate
valvular mitral stenosis (mean gradient, 8 mmHg). Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**12-16**] ECHO (post procedure):
.
A catheter is seen traversing the interatrial septum. The left
atrium is dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is mild valvular mitral
stenosis (mean gradient, 3 mmHg). Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild rheumatic mitral stenosis. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.
.
Compared with the pre-procedure intracardiac echo study of
[**2196-12-16**], the transmitral gradient has decreased significantly,
while severity
