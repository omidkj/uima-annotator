History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**], recent cath with only
LIMA-LAD patent, HTN, HLP, COPD, and afib who presents with 5
day history of red/maroon stools. Patient was at her PCP's
office earlier last week and was found to be anemic (HCT not in
system) and was planned for a colonscopy this week. She was at
home, and earlier today developed substernal chest pressure that
was persistent. She describes this pressure as a squeezing
sensation, different and worse than her usual anginal symptoms
for which she takes nitro. Usually her pain occurs with exertion
or at night when she's not wearing her oxygen and is limited to
her arm, but today it was also in her chest as well. She
described the pain as [**2155-9-26**] initially, and nitro at home did
not help, nor did increasing her O2 from 2-> 3L.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.8, 99, 116/, 24, 100%RA. Initially,
the patient was noted to have bright red blood on rectal exam.
She was tachycardic to the low 100s, but BP remained stable. She
received nitro SL and morphine which improved her CP to [**2155-3-20**].
Cardiology was consulted for the STD seen in the lateral leads,
but they felt this was likely c/w demand ischemia given her
significant anemia and severe coronary disease. She was given 2
units of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP prior to transfer. GI was
called, and felt the patient should have reversal of her INR
(4.5). She was given 5 mg IV vitamin K as well. Her BP remained
stable, and her HR improved to the 80s. She had a 20 and 16G PIV
placed. Her vitals prior to transfer to the MICu were 110/65,
89, 20, 98% 3L. She did complain of some dyspnea/tachypnea prior
to transfer, but her O2 sats remained 98% with 3L of O2.

.
Echo:The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20-30 %) with regional variation. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2153-12-5**], the left
ventricular ejection fraction is markedly reduced.
.
CXR [**2-3**]:Findings suggesting mild congestive heart failure.

CT head, CTA head/neck, CTP [**2155-2-7**]
NON-CONTRAST CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial or
parenchymal
hemorrhage. There is mild bihemispheric hypoattenuation of the
periventricular
and subcortical white matter consistent with sequelae of small
vessel ischemic
disease. The bilateral basal ganglia show small hypoattenuations
consistent
with old lacunar infarcts. There is calcification of the
intracranial carotid
artery. Also noted is a left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
The other
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

CTA OF THE NECK AND HEAD: There is abrupt cutoff of the right
MCA at the
junction of the M1 and M2 segments. This represents a thrombus
within the
right MCA . Also noted is calcification of the bilateral carotid
bulbs. The
remaining intracranial and cervical vessels are unremarkable.
The vertebral
and carotid ostia are unremarkable. A stent is noted in the left
subclavian
artery which is patent.

Also noted are sternotomy wires, bibasilar atelectatic changes
in the
visualized lung apices and a hypoplastic or absent thyroid
gland. Clinical
correlation is recommended.

There are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest
of which is
precarinal and measures 14.3 mm.

CT PERFUSION: There is increased mean transit time in a large
right MCA
territory distribution in the right frontoparietal region. This
is associated
with decreased cerebral blood flow but normal cerebral blood
volume. This
likely represents an acute large infarct with some mismatch
possibly
representing an area of penumbra.

Rotation of the C1 over C2 vertebra is likely positional in
nature.

IMPRESSION: Acute right MCA vascular territory infarct as
described above.

CT head [**2155-2-8**]
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

HbA1c 5.5
LDL 33


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG with only patent LIMA-LAD, COPD,
HTN, afib who presents with hematochezia, anemia, and angina,
sent to MICU initally where she was transfused with HCT back up
to 31, c/b NSTEMI with CHF.
.
# Stroke: has h/o Afib but her anticoagulation was held in the
setting of acute GIB complicated by NSTEMI. It was felt she
would restart ASA 325mg upon discharge. The pt was intact
neurologically throughout admission until [**2-7**] when she was
found to have acute onset dysarthria, L facial droop, L
hemiparesis. Code stroke was called and pt was found to have R
MCA embolic infarct on CT head. She was sent emergently to neuro
IR for IA TPA and MERCI clot retrieval.  She was initially
transferred to the neuro ICU and has been continuing to improve
clinically.  Her coumadin has been re-started and her hematocrit
has remained stable.  Her LDL was 33 and HbA1c was 5.5.  Her INR
on day of transfer ([**2-14**]) was 3.1 and today's dose will be held.
 Please monitor daily for goal [**2-19**].
.
# Hematochezia: likely due to angiodysplasia vs diverticulosis
as pt had colonoscopy in [**2152**] with only polyps. on transfer out
of the MICU her HCT was up to 31 (was initially 22.5 on
admission) after 3U pRBC. While on the floor she was transfused
1 more unit of blood and her HCT was maintained around 30
without any evidence of GI bleeding (stools were without blood).
She was continued on [**Hospital1 **] po pantoprazole.  Her hematocrit has
remained stable in the low 30s.  Gastroenterology plans to
perform a colonoscopy as an ou
