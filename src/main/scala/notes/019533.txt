Left sided weakness

NGT placed on [**11-26**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Known lastname 7474**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with PMH a. fib, tach-brady
syndrome, CHF who presented to OSH with L sided weakness and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for SDH noted on CT scan.  History was
taken
from son over the phone.  5 weeks ago patient was in a normal
state of health.  She was balancing her own check book living
independently with some occasional help from her sister in law.
She used a walker for ambulation out side but other wise was
independent in her ADLS. However, about 5 weeks ago she woke up
and tripped while walking to the bathroom.  At that time she did
strike her head, but was found to have broken her R hip.  Due to
the fact she was on plavix, ORIF was postponed for about 5 days,
until she underwent a hip replacement.  The surgery, however
patient's post op course was complicated by pneumonia treated
with 7 day course of ceftazideime and vanco.  She also developed
afib requiring 3 cardioversions to control the rate.  She also
had multiple episodes of delirium during this course.  She was
eventual transferred to rehab only to return after her HR went
down to the 30s.  Patient then went to an OSH where she suffered
difficulties with nutrition, dehydration, and began to develop
bed sores.  At this time she was sent back to rehab this past
Monday or Tuesday.  She was moving all extremities appropriately
at this time.

Per son, she was doing well while in rehab, returning to her
"old" self, speaking appropriately and moving around more.
However, this past Friday morning she was found not to be moving
her left side and had left sided facial droop.   She was brought
to OSH around 11 AM with a noted left facial droop and a flaccid
left arm. She was noted to be alert at OSH.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
she
was initially noted to be alert, oriented, aware of what
happened, and had a flaccid left arm.
The son was with her in the room, holding her right hand when he
noted that she had began to "shake" in both arms and legs and
was
unresponsive.  This lasted "several" minutes.  He was unsure of
exact timing.  Patient was loaded with dilantin and was given
ativan at this time.  She lethargic for the remainder of the
night.

MRI: [**2159-11-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Punctate foci of hyperintensity on diffusion images without
definite ADC abnormalities in both occipital lobes, likely due
to subacute/acute infarcts.
2. Bilateral subdural hematomas from frontal to occipital
regions with an
acute component in the right parietal region as seen on the CT
of [**2159-11-24**].
3. Small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
4. No evidence of midline shift.

CT [**2159-11-27**]
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of bilateral, predominantly
chronic subdural
collections. Stable right posterior parietal hyperdense,
relatively acute
extraaxial collection.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known lastname 7474**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with PMH a. fib, tach-brady syndrome,
CHF who presented to OSH with L sided weakness and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for SDH noted on CT scan.  While in [**Hospital1 18**]
ED, she had a witnessed episode believed to be seizure and thus
loaded with Dilantin and given Ativan. She continues to have a
limited exam due to somnolence, but it is significant for
dysarthric speech, left facial droop, and an upper moter pattern
of weakness in the left upper and lower extremity.  A repeat CT
in ED showed bilateral, relatively symmetric, acute on chronic
subdural hematomas.  MRI was done which demonstrated multiple
enhancements on MRI DWI but no ADC correlate.  Therefore, a
stroke seems unlikely and enhancements are likely secondary to
T2 shine through.  While, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] paralysis may be contributing
to this weakness.  It appears likely that this weakness and
seizure is a related to the patient's SDH.

NEURO:

#Seizure- patient was witnessed to have a GTC seizure in the
Emergency room.  She was then loaded with Phosphenytoin and
given 1 mg of ativan.  She has not had any events since then.
After 24 hours a follow up phenytoin level was checked of 11.6.
With an albumin of 1.9 is corrected to 24.  Due to the side
effect profile and levels of dilantin, it was decided to wean
her off the dilantin and start her on keppra.  She was initially
written for Keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] and titrated to 750 [**Hospital1 **], which is
what she is being discharged on.

#SDH.  Patient was found on presentation to have bilateral,
relatively symmetric, acute on chronic subdural hematomas with a
more focal region of extra-axial hemorrhage overlying the right
posterior parietal lobe with central hypodensity suggesting
hyperacute hematoma. However, there was no shift of midline
structures.  She was initially admitted to Neurosurgery who did
not feel surgical intervention was needed.  She was transferred
to medicine.  Potential for a stroke was raised but MRI was done
with did not demonstrate any acute infarct.  Therefore, her left
sided weakness was thought to related to her SDH.  Continued to
hold plavix, and arixtra. Patient should follow-up with
Neurosurgery in 4 weeks or earlier as needed. She was started on
81 mg of aspirin.
