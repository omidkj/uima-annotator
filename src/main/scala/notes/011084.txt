Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1945**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall with broken nose, SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multiple blood and platelet transfusions


History of Present Illness:
85 year old female with NHL on chemotherapy, CAD s/p MI and
CABGx1 in [**2135**] admitted with syncopal episode and SDH.
Patientreported that she was fixing breakfast, noted epistaxis,
turned to the left and lost consciousness. There was no prodrome
ofdiaphoresis, nausea, lightheadednes, blurry vision. Patient
didnot know the duration of loss of consciousness but believed
itcould not be more than a few minutes. She did not have loss
ofbowel or bladder function. There was no associated chest
pain,dyspnea or palpitations. She has no prior history of
syncope.

This episode occurred in the context of ongoning anemia
requiring blood transfusion on [**2166-7-2**], likely related to her
oncologic treatment and NHL. On cardiac review of symptoms,
patient reports increased exertional dyspnea compared to
baseline but no angina, dyspnea, or PND. Reports stable 2 pillow
orthopnea and denies any regular aerobic activity other than
walking around her house.

She was taken to the OSH via EMS. Labs were significant
forplatelets of 6, WBC of 1, Hct 23.1, and tbili of 2.2. CT of
the head was significant for bilateral subdural hematomas with a
midline shift. She was intubated briefly for airway protection
because she had blood in the oropharynx. [**Hospital **]
transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care. She was admitted to the SICU for closer
monitoring. No neurosurgical intervention has been performed. An
echocardiogram done on [**7-8**] was notable for an EF of 20%.

Past Medical History:
- NHL
- CAD s/p CABG x 4

Imaging:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral subdural hematomas, right greater than left,
similar in size to the recent CT examination approximately three
hours prior. Stable leftward midline shift, accounting for
differences in technique, measuring approximately 6 mm.
2. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral supratentorial acute subdural hematomas as
described. The
degree of mass effect is stable from the study earlier the same
day. Chronic bilateral posterior fossa subdural collections.

2. Mild narrowing of the cervical right vertebral artery at the
level of C4 due a facet osteophyte. Otherwise, no evidence of
flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm of vessels in the
head or neck.

3. Nasal bone fractures. Nasal and maxillary soft tissue
swelling, right
worse than left.

4. Right thyroid nodule, which could be better assessed by
ultrasound, if not done previously.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated cardiomyopathy.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral fronto temporoparietal and tentorial subdural
hematomas witha
cute component, right larger than left and similar in appearance
from
[**2166-7-7**]. Follow up as clinically indicated if no intervention
is
contemplated. See details above.

2. Slightly decrease of leftward midline shift.

3. Bilateral nasal bone fractures with mild soft tissue swelling
on the right.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is a
slight increase in extent of the bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate increase in extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis.
Otherwise, there is no relevant change. Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly.

CT head w/ contrast:
Slight increase in size of right subdural collection (7mm,
previously 5 mm) and material layering along tentorium, with
interval evolution of blood products and no new hemorrhage.
Slight increase in leftward midline shift and compression of
right lateral ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 13257**] is an 85 y.o woman with past medical history of
coronary artery disease, s/p CABG x4, non-hodgkin's lymphoma
most recently treated with Zevalin in [**Month (only) 116**], radiation therapy who
presented to an outside hospital after a syncopal event and was
found to have a subdural hematoma.  She was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Neuro ICU course:

In the ICU, the patient received 6 units of PRBCs and 4 units of
platelets.  The volume caused her to go into heart failure. The
patient was then given lasix for diuresis, 10mg IV pushes, to
which she responded well.  A subsequent ECHO showed 20% dilated
cardiomyopathy.  The patient was placed on neutropenic
precautions secondary to a WBC 0.6. She was also alkalotic and
started on acetazolamide.  This was discontinued upon discharge
from the ICU.
.
Cardiology was consulted in the ICU and recommended that the
patient be kept euvolemic and started on lisinopril at 5 mg. Due
to the patient's ongoing oncologic problems and
thrombocytopenia, ICD placement was not recommended. Heme/Onc
was consulted and recommended that platelets be kept above
50,000, as also recommended by Neurosurgery.
