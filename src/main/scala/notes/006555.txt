Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, admitted from Cardiology clinic for CHF
exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2195-10-19**] right heart catheterization
[**2195-10-23**] PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**] is a 54y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.2), CAD s/p CABG [**2186**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, and
radial-OM1-OM2) with systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF
has been as low as 20% in the past) who is admitted from clinic
due to concern for CHF exacerbation.

In [**4-/2195**] he had a B&WH admission for heart failure in the
setting of a 30 lb weight gain. There he reportedly had an EF of
20% on admission (in acute decompensated CHF), improved to 40%
on discharge. He was diuresed down to 220 lbs.

After his hospitalization, he was compliant with medications and
feels that he has been good about adhering to a low-salt diet.
He has been on Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **] since then.  Due to recent dietary
changes, he may have a lower baseline dry weight (or,
alternatively decreased muscle mass at baseline).

He came to Cardiology clinic today because of 2 weeks of
progressive shortness of breath on exertion.  ~1 month ago, he
could walk 4 blocks before getting very tired but over the past
2 weeks he has progressed to the point that he is short of
breath after taking a few steps.  He has orthopnea and has not
been able to sleep comfortably; he gets a few hours of rest when
seated in a chair.  He feels exhausted.

Denies chest pain or palpitations.  Prior to CABG, his anginal
pain was exertional back pain, but he has had none of this
recently.  He feels that he has been urinating less after taking
his usual dose of Lasix.  No missed doses of Lasix.  Has been
adhering to his low salt diet.  His weight is up 5 lbs over the
past week and is now 228.17 lbs. Pedal edema is mildly worse
than usual. He notes that he has worsening painless ulcers on
his anterior calves.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
