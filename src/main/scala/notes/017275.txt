[**2112-5-12**] 03:30AM BLOOD TSH-3.5

C-Diff + X 1, however [**6-4**] C-Diff is negative

Sputum on admission was positive for PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA, but
9 days prior to discharge there was no growth seen

All other cultures such as blood and urine were negative for
microorganisms. (Urine had small amounts of yeast).

CT of chest and abdomen ([**4-28**]):

1. Acute abdominal aortic anuerysm rupture with large
retroperitoneal
hematoma and marked amount of active contrast extravasation.
There are
associated signs of hypovolemic shock including hyperenhancement
and perfusion
abnormalities of the intraabdominal organs and bowel and a
flattened IVC.
2. Saccular aneurysm of the ascending thoracic aorta at the
level of the
brachiocephalic artery, without evidence of rupture.

ECHO ([**4-28**]):

The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Renal US ([**5-3**]):

1. Slightly increased echogenicity of the kidneys consistent
with chronic
renal parenchymal disease. Bilateral small simple cysts. No
hydronephrosis.

2. Normal RIs bilaterally with normal acceleration times in the
main renal
artery at the hilum of the kidney. No evidence of renal artery
stenosis.

Upper and Lower extremity US ([**5-9**]):

LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY DVT ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler
examination of
the left common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins
was
performed. Normal compressibility, augmentation, waveforms and
Doppler flow is demonstrated. There is no evidence of
intraluminal clot.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY DVT ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
examination of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary,
basilic, brachial and cephalic veins was performed. Except for a
segment in the distal portion of one of the two brachial veins,
normal compressibility, augmentation, waveforms and Doppler flow
is demonstrated. The segment of one of the two brachial veins
demonstrates absence of Doppler flow and absence of
compressibility, consistent with DVT.

IMPRESSION: Thrombosis of a distal segment of one of the two
brachial veins. Patency of all other remaining veins of the left
upper extremity.

ECHO ([**5-13**]):

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-5-11**],
the current study is technically superior, and aortic
regurgitation is now seen. The overall findings appear similar.


CT chest and abdomen ([**5-13**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

2. No evidence of active extravasation from the aortic aneurysm
repair.
Slight interval decrease in the size of the retroperitoneal
hematoma which
still has high density material they may be iodine from initial
extravasation reabsorbing, but some hemorrhage since surgery can
not be
excluded.

3. Occluded [**Female First Name (un) 899**] as expected. High grade stenosis celiac artery
origin and
moderate stenosis proximal SMA places the patient at increased
risk for
mesenteric ischemia. No abnormal bowel evident.

4. No intra-abdominal abscess.

5. Atelectasis with superimposed aspiration or focal pneumonia.
Effusion at
the right lung base.

6. Right renal infarcts, mostly lower pole. Moderate right renal
artery
stenosis.

7. Ulcerative plaque in the left common iliac and dangling
plaque in the
aorta. Bilateral moderate common iliac artery narrowing.
Unchanged aneurysm
in the right brachiocephalic.

MRI Cervical ([**5-20**]):

IMPRESSION: Straightening and reversal of the cervical lordosis.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine as
described in detail above.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to the
emergency department after being involving a low-speed motor
vehicle collision.  However, she was complaining of intense back
pain and was found to be hypotensive in the 80s.  The patient
underwent abdominal CT scan which revealed active extravasation
from an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a contained
rupture into the right retroperitoneum.  The patient was then
immediately brought to the operating room ([**2112-4-28**]) for urgent
open repair.  The patient was not a candidate for endovascular
repair given the size of her native arteries.  Following the AAA
repair, the patient's abdomen was unable to be closed due to
massive fluid resusitation and left open and VAC dressing was
placed. The patient was extremely coagulopathic, cold and
acidotic. The patient was brought back to the intensive care
unit where she was resuscitated and rewarmed.

POD1 ([**4-29**]):  Over night, the patient improved. Pt still
remained critically ill but acidosis resolved, renal function
was good and left foot was remarkably improved with PT signal.
However, there is still a fair amount of bloody drainage coming
through her abdominal wound VAC dressing. Therefore, it was
decided to take the patient back to the operating room for
exploration, evacuation of the hematoma.  Evacuation of hematoma
with VAC closure ([**2112-4-29**]).  There was no evidence of
bleeding. The liver was also explored and a previously noticed
liver laceration was found to be not actively bleeding.  A very
small branch off of the IVC was seen
to have a small tear and this was also suture ligated place.  An
abdominal VAC was reapplied and the patient was transferred in
stable condition to the ICU intubated. There were no
complications.
