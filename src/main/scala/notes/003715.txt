Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Severe ischemia of lower extremities/ s/p R. ilio-femoral and
femoral-femoral bypass graft.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thrombectomy of right iliofemoral graft, femoral-femoral graft,
patch angioplasty of right femoral artery and left femoral
artery with saphenous vein.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60M with history of right sided stage III
laryngeal cancer diagnosed in [**2099**] and treated with chemotherapy
(adjuvant taxol and cisplatin followed by taxol, cisplatin and

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-2-15**] 9:06 AM

CHEST: AP portable semi-upright view. The nasogastric tube and
the left internal jugular central venous catheter remain in good
positions. There is interval worsening of bilateral perihilar
and basilar opacities, consistent with increasing congestive
heart failure. There are persistent opacities in the right and
left upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
Multiple surgical clips are again seen in the upper mid abdomen
and just above the gastroesophageal junction.

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure.
2. Unchanged right and left upper lobe pneumonia versus
aspiration.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2106-2-15**] 4:20 PM

CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Emphysema is again noted,
with multiple bullae in the middle and upper lobes. There are
confluent ground-glass opacities as well as interlobular septal
thickening in both upper lobes, right middle lobe, lingula, and
the superior and anterior portions of the lower lobes. The
opacities are most dense in the upper lobes. Small peripheral
centrilobular ground-glass opacities are present throughout both
lower lobes, similar in appearance to [**2104-7-16**]. While the
centrilobular and confluent ground glass opacities are
consistent with aspiration or pneumonia, presence of
interstitial septal thickening also suggest pulmonary edema.
While there is some nodularity within the opacities, nodular
opacities that were seen in the left upper and right lower lobes
on [**2105-7-16**] are no longer present. There is no evidence of an
abscess.

The trachea, right and left main stem bronchi are mildly
dilated. Mild-to- moderate bronchiectasis is noted in the upper
lobes, right middle lobe and lingula. Dependent secretions are
noted in the trachea.

There are numerous enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, increased
in number and size compared to [**2104-7-16**]. The largest right
superior mediastinal node measures 12 mm in short axis diameter.
The largest upper right paratracheal node measures 11 mm. The
largest lower right paratracheal node measures 9 mm. The largest
right para-aortic node measures 12 mm. The largest subcarinal
node measures 15 mm. The largest right para-esophageal node
measures 13 mm. Numerous subcentimeter nodes are present in both
hila.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no
pericardial effusion. Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications
are present in the thoracic aorta. Mural thrombus is noted in
the proximal abdominal aorta.

There is an unchanged ill-defined hypodensity in the right lobe
of the thyroid gland, measuring approximately 2 x 1 cm.

There is an approximately 4 cm hypodense lesion in the lower
pole of the spleen, unchanged compared to the [**2106-2-13**] abdominal
CT, which may represent a splenic infarction. Scattered
calcified granulomas are again noted in the liver. Stones are
again seen in the gallbladder. Surgical clips are again noted in
the porta hepatis and in the region of the gastroesophageal
junction. The imaged portions of the pancreas, adrenal glands,
and kidneys appear unremarkable. The imaged bones appear
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, confluent in the upper
and middle lobes, consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
Recurrent interlobular septal thickening is consistent with
superimposed pulmonary edema. Given foci of nodularity,
follow-up is recommended after treatment. No evidence of an
abscess.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Mild central tracheal dilatation. Diffuse mild-to-moderate
bronchiectasis in the upper and middle lobes.
4. Increased number and size of mediastinal and bilateral hilar
lymph nodes, which may be reactive. However, metastatic disease
cannot be excluded, and follow-up after treatment is
recommended.
5. Hypodense splenic lesion, unchanged since [**2106-2-13**], compatible
with an infarct.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Unchanged hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid.

EKG

Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to
tracing #1, no
diagnostic change.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
Hazy nodular opacities about the airways within the lower lungs
have increased since the prior study consistent with small
airways disease. There is mild hazy opacity within the lung
bases which could represent normal lung at expiration, however
mild ground glass airspace disease cannot be excluded.

There is a hepatic granuloma within the dome of the liver. No
concerning hepatic lesions. There are multiple small gallstones
dependently within the gallbladder. No gallbladder wall
thickening. No biliary ductal dilatation or choledocholithiasis
evident. There is a choledochojejunostomy, which is normal in
appearance.

Within the inferior aspect of the spleen, there is a large
hypodense lesion, without enhancement measuring 4.4 x 4.3 x 3.9
cm that has significantly increased since the [**5-7**] study. There
is an adjacent smaller similar- appearing lesion lateral to this
larger lesion. These are nonspecific but considerations would
include a splenic infarct. There is no stranding around these
lesions, however infection of the lesions cannot be excluded.
Small splenic hemangioma is also again noted unchanged.

The pancreas is normal in appearance. The patient has undergone
gastric bypass with a gastrojejunostomy. Adrenal glands are
normal in appearance. No bowel wall thickening. No evidence of
bowel wall thickening or bowel obstruction. The appendix
contains contrast within it and gas, possibly from prior CT
scan. No evidence for appendicitis. Small amount of fluid within
the right lower quadrant is nonspecific.

The kidneys show heterogeneous hypoenhancement symmetrically in
a patchy geographic pattern in some locations. These areas have
heterogeneous enhancement still on nephrographic phase. There is
no persistent staining on the delayed images, nor is there
contrast within the kidneys on the pre- contrast CT remaining
from [**2106-2-11**] angiogram. These findings are nonspecific but
considerations would include embolic phenomenon such as
cholesterol or other emboli. Of note, there is a large calcified
plaque within the right renal artery just beyond its origin with
at least moderate narrowing
