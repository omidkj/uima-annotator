Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old male with
a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary
artery disease, status post inferior myocardial infarction,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, mild chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who was
transferred to the CCU from the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory with a pericardial tamponade.  The patient was
admitted to an outside hospital with supraventricular
tachycardia and treated with a calcium channel blocker which
led to complete heart block at which time a dual chamber
pacemaker implant was placed.  The patient was discharged
[**2146-1-14**].  The patient returned to the outside hospital on
[**2146-1-18**], with chest pain, and was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  A transthoracic echocardiogram at that time was
without evidence of pericardial effusion on [**2146-1-19**].  The
patient did have a positive stress test, went to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory there and was transferred to CMI
service at [**Hospital1 69**] for left
circumflex intervention.  On [**2146-1-20**], the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization which demonstrated left main 30%,
left anterior descending 50% proximal, pressure determined to
be insignificant, left circumflex 70% which was stented with
2.5 by 13 millimeters.  The patient was transferred to the
C-Medicine service with an original blood pressure of 128/42.
At 11:30 p.m., on [**2146-1-20**], the patient complained of chest
pain, heaviness which radiated to his back and neck.
Nitroglycerin was given, and systolic blood pressure dropped
to 105.  He was given fluid.  The systolic blood pressure
during that night was in the 70s to 80s.  The patient was
taken back to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  There
was a patent left circumflex stent with a new moderately
severe stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending.
Proximal and distal left anterior descending were
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied.  The
patient had ventricular tachycardia and was treated with
Amiodarone.  Right heart catheterization showed right atrial
pressure of 23, right ventricle 28/23, pulmonary artery 28/23
and a wedge pressure of 24.  Echocardiogram demonstrated
tamponade.  Pericardiocentesis at that time removed 650cc of
bloody fluid.  Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, then
later pulled in the CCU.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Plavix.
3.  Integrilin.
4.  Protonix.
5.  Lopressor 25 mg twice a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO CCU:  Temperature is 91,
heart rate 60 and paced, blood pressure 88/54, oxygen
saturation 98% on AC ventilation, 800 by 18, FIO2 of 100%,
PEEP of 5.  Generally, the patient is intubated, sedated but
frowning, moving arms.  The pupils were 2.0 millimeters,
sluggishly reactive bilaterally, no scleral icterus.  The
patient was pale.  The oropharynx was dry.  Decreased tongue
vesiculations. Neck - jugular venous distention to ear while
supine.  Lungs - bilateral breath sounds without wheezing or
crackles anteriorly or laterally.  Pericardial drain in place
oozing on bandage and actively bleeding.  Heart with distant
sounds.  Groin - left femoral Swan, right IUBP site, all
pulses dopplerable except left dorsalis pedis.

LABORATORY DATA:  At 8:00 a.m., arterial blood gases revealed
pH 7.36/16/312, lactate 12.1.  INR 1.6.  Partial
thromboplastin time 81.9.  White blood cell count 16.9,
hematocrit 31.9, platelet count 313,000.  Sodium 139,
potassium 4.0, chloride 106, bicarbonate 9, blood urea
nitrogen 16, creatinine 1.4.  It was 1.1 at the outside
hospital.  Glucose 247 by fingerstick, anion gap 24.
Urinalysis - specific gravity 1.010, large blood, positive
nitrite, positive leukocyte esterase, greater than 300
protein, 250 glucose.

Chest x-ray showed endotracheal tube in good position, left
pleural effusion, question of right middle lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram was ventricular paced with a left bundle
branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was an 83 year old man with
coronary artery disease, hypertension, status post PCI with
pericardial tamponade and 650cc pericardiocentesis.  The
patient was on Integrilin, Aspirin and Plavix so bleeding
persisted in the setting of dysfunctional platelets.  The
patient was transferred to the CCU from the catheterization
laboratory for closer monitoring.  Coagulopathy was corrected
with platelet transfusions, DDAVP, Vitamin K and fresh frozen
plasma.  The patient was also transfused packed red blood
cells.  Since the patient was status post a left circumflex
stent and a left anterior descending percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty times two, the patient's
enzymes were continued to be cycled especially in the setting
of the discontinuation of Integrilin, Aspirin and Plavix.  On
presentation, the patient remained paced at 60 beats per
minute.  The acidosis was thought to be secondary to the
setting of hypotension, lactic acid buildup.  The patient was
also started on insulin drip.  Electrolytes were monitored
closely for stabilization.  Overall, the patient received
four units of packed red blood cells, three units of
platelets and one pack of fresh frozen plasma the first
night.  In addition, blood cultures were sent and there were
gram negative rods in one out of four bottles.  He was
started on Levaquin while awaiting identification and
sensitivities.  The patient otherwise remained stable with
acidosis improving and improved glucose control, no longer
requiring an insulin drip.  In addition, his creatinine
improved with improved perfusion.  The following day the
patient had a repeat bedside echocardiogram which showed that
the right atrium and right ventricle were filling well.  In
addition, the patient was starting to be weaned off the
ventilator. Thus from the standpoint of the tamponade, there was
minimal drainage and the preceding echocardiogram showed no
reaccumulation of fluid.  At that point, an Aspirin and low
dose beta blocker were added.  The patient did well and was
extubated later on [**2146-1-23**].  Overnight on [**2146-1-23**], the
patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
The pericardial drain was removed and as noted previously the
patient was extubated.  He did have an event of
supraventricular tachycardia to the 120s, and was given 5 mg
of Lopressor with an appropriate response of his heart rate
back to the 90s.  The patient continued to improve and he was
continued on Aspirin.  The beta blocker was titrated up, and
ace inhibitor was added.  Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram
was to be obtained and if no evidence of reaccumulation, the
patient was to be restarted on Plavix.  Concern was that the
patient was coagulopathic, and laboratories were consistent
with DIC.  Since he remained stable, it was determined just
to give blood products as needed for reversal.  The patient
continued on levofloxacin for the gram negative rod
bacteremia.  The patient was transferred to the floor on
[**2146-1-24**].  While on the floor, the patient had an additional
episode of tachycardia to the 130s with a decrease in his
systolic blood pressure at 100 to 110.  The patient was given
5 mg of intravenous Lopressor with a decrease in his heart
rate to the 120s and systolic blood pressure increased to
120s.  He was given a repeat dose of 5 mg of intravenous
Lopressor with a quick return of his heart rate to the 60s
and 70s and the blood pressure remained stable.  The patient
remained asymptomatic throughout this period.  On [**2146-1-25**],
the patient was increased on his standing beta blocker.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, without evidence
of tamponade.  The patient continued to do well without
evidence of tamponade physiology and remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was on his Captopril 6.25 mg three times a day,
Metoprolol 50 mg twice a day and restarted on his Plavix 75
mg for a goal of nine months of treatment.   The patient was
also started on Atorvastatin 10 mg once daily.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE::
