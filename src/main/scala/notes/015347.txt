Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Intubation, Arterial -Line, Central Venous Access
Line

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old woman, recently hospitalized for C.
Difficile sepsis and shock, complicated by readmission
hypoxia/hypercarbia ([**Date range (1) 5975**]) who presents with respiratory
distress and respiratory failure.
.
The patient had reportedly been doing well in rehab until today
when she was noted to have an altered (depressed) mental status,
tachypnea, and dyspnea.  EMS was called who found the patient in
extremis, intubation was attempted x2 and failed.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] airway
was placed and the patient was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] emergency
department.  There were no reports of increased coughing or
stooling from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
.
The patient has had a complicated medical course in the past
month -
.
In brief, the patient was initially discharge on [**4-19**] after
a 14 hosptilazation for c.diff colitis complicated by sepsis and
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  On the
day following discharge from that admission, the patient was
noted to be complaining of worsening SOB and ABG at [**Hospital 100**] rehab
was 7.4/73/63. She was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-20**] to the MICU
and intially reuqired biPAP for HD1-2. Her oxygen requirement on
d/c was 2L NC.   The etiology of her hypercarbic respiratory
failure was felt to be [**12-21**] hypoventilation from somnolence
related to oversedation with zyprexa which was held on
discharge. A CTA chest was negative for PE and showed no clear
evidence of pneumonia.  She was initially started on HCAP
antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were stopped on HD 4 prior
to discharge given that all cultures were negative and there was
no consolidation on imaging.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: HR: 82 BP: 94 systolic Resp: No
spontaneous respirations O(2)Sat: 100;  Initial labs
demonstrated hct 22.0, wbc 16.0, creatinine 0.3, BIN 18, lipase
148 and lactate 0.9. A cxr demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions with R>L.   A UA demonstrated large leuks, positive
nitrites and 104 wbc.  Due respiratory failure the patient was
intubated.
.
An initial ABG was 7.22/70/128 which was 7.23/62/395 post
intubation.  The patient was given vancomycin and cefepime for
coverage of both a urinary and pulmonary source. Post intubation
her BP dropped to the 50s. She was started on levophed and
phenylephrine through her existing PICC line. Given her altered
mental status on arrival, a head CT was performed which showed
no acute findings. Vitals on transfer were: 36.3 66 118 107/58
99%.
.
Vent settings were: fio2 60% RR 18 Vt 400 peep 5. Sedation with
midazolam and fentanyl. She was transferred on levophed alone w/
MAPs> 70.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  vitals were: 36.2 106/58 77 18 (vented)
100% on 40% FiO2.  The patient was on a levophed drip, was not
sedated, was unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli, was
thought to have a brief episode of decerebrate posturing with
the upper extremities.
