CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  ([**2179-3-25**])
IMPRESSION: Large "saddle" embolus within the main pulmonary
artery with extension into both main pulmonary arteries and
their subsegmental branches. There is associated ground-glass
opacity in the left upper lobe that most likely represents an
acute infarction. There is also CT evidence of right ventricular
strain as demonstrated by right ventricular dilatation. The main
pulmonary artery size is in the upper limit of normal range.

ECHO ([**2179-3-26**])
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricularn filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly  thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-3-28**]
A previously reported confluent left perihilar opacity shows
slight interval improvement with residual hazy opacity
remaining. Remainder of the lungs are clear, and there are no
pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Pulmonary embolism:
Patient presented with a large saddle PE involving the main
pulmonary artery extending into both pulmonary arteries and
their subsegmental branches.  An echo was performed which showed
evidence of right heart strain.  An IVC filter was placed on
[**2179-3-26**].  She was started on a heparin gtt with coumadin.  The
patient's INR was followed and the heparing gtt was stopped when
an INR was elevated at 6.6.  She should continue on warfarin for
at least 6months.  INR was 3.2 on the day of discharge.
Warfarin should be held [**4-2**] and resumed [**2179-4-3**] at 2mg QHS.

She initially required high-flow mask to maintain O2 sats; this
was weaned over her stay - she was mid 90s on 5 liters via nasal
cannula at the time of discharge.  Blood pressures were stable
throughout with a persistent tachycardia present.
It was felt that the PE was secondary to immobilization from her
many prior surgeries.

2. Pneumonia:
Fevers, leukocytosis on admission. CXR/CT were consistent with
pneumonia.  She was treated with levofloxacin for seven days.

3. Hypertension:
Initially, her atenolol and valsartan were held in the setting
of acute PE.  The beta-blocker was restarted slowly (as
metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]) as the patient remained tachycardic (possibly
from rebound).  She was discharged on atenolol 25mg daily.  The
valsartan was held throughout with the possibility of restarting
upon discharge.

4. Hypercholesterolemia:
Continued statin.

5. Hypothyroidism:
Continued synthroid.

6. Osteooarthritis:
Continued fosamax, calcium, celebrex, oxycodone PRN.

7. Peripheral edema:
Patient presented on Lasix/Spironolactone for chronic lower
extremity edema.  In the setting of possible RV dysfunction from
PE, these medications were held.  Stockings were used to help
mobilize some of the fluid.
