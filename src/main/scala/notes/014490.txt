Chief Complaint:
headache, fever, chills, tachycardia

none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 34 year old female with suspected immunodeficiency
being worked up as an outpatient who presented to the ED with
sudden onset of headache and chills that were accompanied by
tachycardia, neck stiffness, and shortness of breath. Earlier
that day she started taking amoxicillin she'd been given to take
as needed after she began to feel ill. She'd had a recent prior
admission to the ICU for pneumococcal sepsis in [**2125-5-19**],
complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and fetal
demise.  This admission, there was initial concern for
pneumoccal sepsis and so the patient was aggresively fluid
resuscitated with 9L normal saline in the ED.  Additionally, she
received IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone, linezolide, and Pen G) and
high dose steroids. She had a maximum fever of 103F and
leukocytosis with maximum wbc count of 44. The patient had LP
which was unremarkable, without evidence of microorganisms or
neutrophils on gram stain and without growth in bacterial/fungal
cultures. She was admitted to the ICU with diagnosis of sepsis;
however all culture data (CSF, urine, blood, stool)was negative
to date. A recent MRI of head revealed pansinusitis. Chest X ray
revealed bilateral basilar infiltrates with right costophrenic
angle effusion that was improving in serial films. In the ICU,
she has been continued on IV Ampicillin and Ceftriaxone pre ID
consult recommendation and recovered quickly and followed the
hospital's gluten free diet.  The day before transfer to the
medicine service, she had an episode of nausea and vomiting. At
the time of transfer to the medicine floor, the patient was
feeling well in her usual state of health.  Her only complaint
was loose stools that started after hospitalization and were
similar to past diarrheal episodes relieved by immodium. C.diff
toxin and multiple stool cultures were negative.

She has been referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 27272**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29826**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
allergist/immunologist at [**Hospital3 1810**], by her [**Hospital1 112**]
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 29827**]. Initial evaluation has shown
weak anti-pneumococcal titers, low complement levels, and high
IgG count. She has received pneumovax.  [**Location (un) **]-Jolly bodies were
seen on her peripheral smear although there has not been further
evidence of splenic dysfunction.  She sees a gastroenterologist
for celiac sprue, which has been well managed in the past few
months on a gluten-free diet.

CXR [**2125-10-8**]: Mild upper lung zone redistribution. Small
bilateral effusions and bilateral lower lobe patchy opacities.
The right effusion is smaller.
CXR [**2125-10-7**]:The previously identified pulmonary edema has been
resolved. There is small left pleural effusion. Patchy opacity
is seen in both lower lobes. These findings most likely
represent patchy atelectasis. The posterior pneumonia cannot be
excluded. There is also a new patchy opacity in the right apex
overlying the right 1st rib. This may represent patchy area of
pneumonia ossification.
CXR [**2125-10-6**] 4AM:Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, likely due to
volume overload. Development of infection is unusual since the
prior study 2 hours earlier did not show the presence of
significant pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2125-10-6**] 2AM:The lung volumes are low. The mediastinal and
hilar contours are unremarkable. The heart size is normal. There
