Brief Hospital Course:
60F with DM, morbid obesity, OSA, and O2-dependent COPD admitted
to OSH with cholecystitis s/p lap CCY [**11-10**] transferred for
management of presumed cholangitis due to retained stone.
.
#Cholangitis - On arrival patient was hemodynamically stable but
with low-grade fever, rising WBC# and Tbili 4.7 concerning for
retained stone causing ascending infection.  She was started on
IV zosyn and underwent ERCP, w/ sphincterotomy and stone
removal.  She was extubated successfully [**11-12**].  CXR was notable
for volume overload and pt treated w/ iv lasix, then switched to
home po lasix.  IV zosyn was switched to po cipro/flagyl for 7
day course following ERCP.  Her diet was advanced successfully.
.
#COPD: Patient successfully extubated [**11-12**].  She had stable
resp status.  CXR evident for volume overload and patient
received iv lasix with improvement.  She was continued on
nebulizer treatment which she felt improved her respiratory
status considerably.  It was thus recommended that she discuss
possibility of continued nebulizer therapy at home.  On [**11-14**]
there was one episode of coughing accompanied by desaturation to
68% followed by return to baseline.  In this setting she
developed "heartburn."  An ECG revealed no new findings from
[**11-10**] and a CXR showed no new infiltrates.
.
#OSA:  Continued home CPAP qhs
