Per OMR notes, the cough is longstanding and thought to be due
to GERD vs postnasal drip. She was admitted from [**10-1**], again on

The first admission, she was given Azithromycin and Prednisone
x5 days, and nebulizers and felt better and was discharged home.
She represented [**10-7**] with the same sxs, CXR did not show
infiltrates and reactive airway from viral process was suspected
and she was given Combivent nebs, IS, Tessalon perles, and
Guaifenesin. She did not require oxygen that admission.

not using it.

Chest x-ray ([**2147-12-18**]):
Prominence of the hila appears similar to prior examinations.
There is mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aorta. Within
the lung parenchyma, no overt pulmonary edema is seen. No focal
opacity to suggest pneumonia is present. No pneumothorax is
identified. No pleural effusion is seen. The pleural surface
contours are normal. There are bilateral shoulder prostheses.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT chest: full report pending at time of discharge. Film was
reviewed with ICU team and did not show evidence of acute
process such as infiltrate or pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: In summary this is an 84yoF with chronic sinusitis and
bronchitis, 2 recent admissions for cough, who presents with
persistent cough and shortness of breath.

1. Persistent cough: Unclear etiology:  On presentation Ms.
[**Known lastname 805**] appeared to be SOB and dyspneic after several words,
reportedly with tight and wheezy sounding lungs, and was having
CP from repeated coughing. Denied fevers. She had a CXR with wet
read showing cardiomegaly but no focal acute process. ABG
showed: 7.48 / 46 / 63 / 35. She was treated like a COPD
exacerbation and received albuterol nebs x2, ipratropium nebs
x2, Methylpred 125mg IV x1, Ceftriaxone 1g IV x1, Azithromycin
500 mg IV x1. She was briefly put on Bipap. Vitals before
transfer to ICU: 62  115/66  19  90% on Bipap; however also per
report, "her RA sats were fine while in the ED."

Per OMR notes, the cough is longstanding and thought to be due
to GERD vs postnasal drip.   In the ICU, pt chart reviewed.
PFT's with mild restrictive defect, can't r/o obstructive
defect, TLC's normal without change in FVC since last measured.
Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**11/2147**] who found her cough was improved
with azelastine and felt her PFT's were near enough to normal.
Etiologies to consider include postnasal gtt, restrictive vs
obstructive lung disease, GERD/laryngeopharyngeal reflux,
chronic aspiration, recurrent viral URI's in the setting of
reactive airway disease/asthma exacerbations, Lisinopril effect
(was discontinued 2 wks ago), lung cancer (h/o smoking present
but not strong), and allergic reaction. Her ABG indicated some
degree of CO2 retention and possible OSA. Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] increased
LE edema and TTE was considered but not performed in house as
patient appeared clinically well in the ICU.  While in the ICU,
held off on providing further steroids.  She was given
albuterol/ipartropium nebs q2 hours as needed.  No further
antibiotics were provided.
Her presentation was stable, with a persistent hacking cough.
Went for a CT chest which was suggestive of severe
bronchomalacia of the right main stem
bronchus, with inflammatory changes of the bronchi and
bronchioles to the lower lobes, but no acute process. When her
respiratory status was felt to be at baseline, Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] was
d/c home with PRN nebulizers and close PCP follow up.
Would recommend f/u with GI, ENT, pulm, allergy as outpt
(allergy testing has been negative x2)

2. CAD/HTN: Uneventful in the hospital.  Continued home HCTZ,
