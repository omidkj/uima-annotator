CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Refractory AML.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 26-year-old female
with progressive AML diagnosed [**3-9**] status post 7 + 3 x2,
most recently [**3-10**] complicated by prolonged aplasia
approximately 32 days with appendicitis/typhlitis, who
represents with 7 + 3 reinduction to be followed by
preparation for mismatched allo-BMT.

Since recent discharge on [**2174-4-13**], patient has been followed
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in clinic with progressively increased from a
white count of 4800 with 80% blasts on discharge to 61,700
and 98% blasts on [**4-19**], the day prior to admission.  She has
been treated with increases of Hydrea 1 gram q.d. to 3 grams
q.d. on admission.

Currently, patient describes progressive increase in fatigue
without fevers, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, cough,
chest pain, or extremity pain.  She reports nausea with
medications relieved by Ativan without any new right lower
quadrant abdominal pain or discomfort.  Patient denies recent
bruising, bleeding, or headache/changes in mental status.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  Vancomycin has in the
past been reported to cause rash, that is false.  AmBisome
causes diaphoresis, severe nausea, vomiting, and chills.  Has
been avoided as needed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Progressive AML diagnosed [**3-9**].  See
history of present illness for details.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Hydrea 3000 mg b.i.d.
2. Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Ativan 0.5 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. prn anxiety and
nausea.  Hickman line care.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with family in [**Location (un) 1468**], I
believe.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No known history of leukemia.

VITAL SIGNS:  T current 97.7, 110, 114/66, 20, and 99% on
room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  In no apparent distress, alert and oriented
times three.  Patient was anicteric.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Moist oral mucosa.  No oral petechiae or
hemorrhages.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Tachycardic, regular
rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended without rebound or
guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly was noted.  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema, 2+ pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count of 69.2
with 93% blasts, hematocrit 27.0, platelets 339.  Chem-7 was
unremarkable.  LFTs were unremarkable.  Uric acid was 2.9.

RELEVANT STUDIES:  He had a [**4-12**] abdominal CT, which showed
persistent inflammatory phlegmon surrounding appendix to
cecal tip.  The small fluid collection was undrainable.

She had an echocardiogram [**3-2**], which showed an EF of 65%.
Normal study.

Micro data:  Blood cultures drawn [**4-18**] are pending.

In summary, this is a 26-year-old female with resistant and
progressive AML readmitted for 7 + 3 reinduction to be
followed by Cytoxan/TBI and mismatched MUD allo-BMT.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. AML:  Patient was reinduced with idarubicin and cytarabine
7 + 3 with appropriate reduction in her white blood cell
count.  She remained neutropenic at the time of this
dictation [**2174-5-6**] with pancytopenia.  She was treated with
supportive care with blood and platelets, and remained on
neutropenic precautions given the appropriate mouth care,
repletion of electrolytes, bowel regimen, pain control, etc.

At this point in time, the decision to proceed with allo-BMT
was pending.  The recommendations of the attending physicians
had not been decided at this time.  Please see additional
dictation summary for further treatment of the patient's AML.

2. Fever and neutropenia:  Patient was intermittently febrile
throughout her hospital course while she was on neutropenic.
She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for a known
right lower quadrant inflammatory process, and was treated
with Flagyl, voriconazole, meropenem, Vancomycin, acyclovir,
and most recently ciprofloxacin.  Patient continued to spike
fevers through antibiotic treatments.  She had been cultured
on multiple occasions with negative culture data to date.
She has been followed with serial abdominal exams and CAT
scans of her abdomen.

Most recently she had a CT of the torso on [**2174-5-5**], which
showed no disease within the chest with a small stable
pulmonary nodule.  However, her CT of her abdomen and pelvis
showed progression of her extensive inflammatory changes
involving the appendix.  No drainable fluid collections,
however, there was free fluid within the right pelvis.

Additionally, the patient has noticed some interval change in
her abdomen with sensation of fullness within her right lower
quadrant, though she continues to deny pain.  Consequently at
this time, given her limited options, she has been seen by
Surgery.  However, surgery in this instance has not been
recommended.  We will continue to treat her with
broad-spectrum antibiotics with the understanding that her
counts will not recover at this time without transplant.

3. FEN:  The patient remained NPO throughout her hospital
stay.  She was started on TPN and continued to have her
electrolytes repleted by scale.

ADDENDUM:  Please see next dictation by the following intern
for complete details on the rest of her hospital course.
