HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was originally
admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service and was then
transferred three to four days later to the C-MED Service.

This is a 73-year old female with coronary artery disease
(status post coronary artery bypass grafting and multiple
cardiac catheterizations and percutaneous interventions at
outside hospitals), peripheral vascular disease, chronic
renal insufficiency, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
who was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
from an outside hospital to the Vascular Surgery Service with
a right lower extremity gangrenous ulceration.  The reason
for transfer was for possible vascular intervention.

On arrival to the Vascular Surgery Service the patient's INR
was elevated as she had been on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation.  She was given two units of fresh frozen plasma
to reverse her coagulopathy and developed jaw pain (her
anginal equivalent) and went into acute cardiogenic pulmonary
edema.  The patient was nearly intubated but improved with a
nitroglycerin drip and Natrecor.

She was then transferred to the C-MED Service for further
diuresis and because her exercise tolerance test sestamibi
obtained following her acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema
showed reversible anterior defects as well as partially
reversible lateral wall defects.  Her creatine kinase and
troponin were flat at the time of the acute cardiogenic
pulmonary edema.  The patient did report some baseline
shortness of breath, but felt that it was worse at the time
of transfer to C-MED Service.  However, at baseline the
patient can only walk 15 feet with a walker and is limited by
anginal pain or shortness of breath.  The patient did report
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity
edema in the past - but not currently.  The patient uses 2
liters of oxygen at home.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed and has two
daughters.  She does not smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 99.2, heart rate was 69 (range 60 to 69),
blood pressure was 147/35 (range 120 to 141/29 to 63), and 98
percent on 4 liters.  In general,  the patient was a
chronically ill-appearing elderly female sitting upright in
mild respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination the pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light.  The extraocular movements were intact.  The moist
mucous membranes.  Neck revealed jugular venous pressure
approximately 14 but difficult to assess given the patient's
neck pannus.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper
sternal border.  Lungs with bibasilar rales halfway up.  The
abdomen was obese, slightly distended, left-sided scar, and
nontender.  Extremities revealed trace edema of right and
left foot.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Significant for
a hematocrit of 31.8, INR of 1.5, a partial thromboplastin
time of 58.8, and creatinine of 1.4.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  The patient's previous
catheterization in [**2105**] at the [**Hospital6 1708**]
showed saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending
patent, and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery patent, skip graft to the obtuse marginal from the
posterior descending artery which was occluded.  The left
circumflex was totally occluded with collaterals.  The right
coronary artery with 95 percent tubular stenosis.  No
intervention was done at this last previous catheterization
in [**2105**].


SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was
   transferred to the C-MED Service and initiated on Natrecor
   as well as intravenous Lasix.  The patient's volume status
   throughout her hospital course was difficult to evaluate
   given her lack of neck veins; however, her lungs had shown
   evidence of volume overload as did her chest x-ray.

The patient did respond with much diuresis with the Natrecor.
An ACE inhibitor was initiated as the patient had not been on
it previously and a low ejection fraction.  The following day
- after two doses of captopril and continuing the Natrecor -
the patient developed acute-on-chronic renal failure with a
creatinine that bumped to 2 and hypotension which responded
to a 250-cc normal saline bolus.  Her captopril was held, and
the patient's blood pressure stabilized.

The following day the patient was transferred to the Coronary
Intensive Care Unit for possible Swan-Ganz catheter
placement.  As the patient's respiratory status had appeared
to become depressed, and secondary to increased creatinine,
the diuresis was not going well.  In the Coronary Care Unit
the Natrecor was restarted.  A nitroglycerin drip was also
initiated.  The patient did not further diurese but did
improve respiratory wise and was called back out to the C-MED
Service floor.

The patient was continued on Natrecor and was also tried on
Lasix as well as Bumex and Zaroxolyn.  The patient did
respond somewhat to the Zaroxolyn and Lasix combination, but
her sodium subsequently dropped from 130 to 125 two days
status post Zaroxolyn, and this was again held.  The patient
did again have a further episode of what appeared to be acute
cardiogenic pulmonary edema on [**7-24**] which responded to
nitroglycerin, morphine, and hydralazine, as well as the
Natrecor which was already present.  During all of these
episodes the patient was very hypertensive, and it was
thought that impaired filling was causing the acute
decompensation.

The patient's creatinine did improve enough that she was able
to go for a cardiac catheterization.  The cardiac
catheterization also had a right heart catheterization which
was performed to the neck secondary to the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter.  The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
was 24, and her right atrial pressure was 12 during that
catheterization.

Following this cardiac catheterization, the patient was back
to the floor and the plan was to further diurese her because
her lungs still sounded wet.  However, the patient was not
responding to the Natrecor and Lasix - and the problems
mentioned above of electrolytes occurring with the Zaroxolyn
also began to complicate matters.  The patient seemed very
hyponatremic on [**7-29**]; probably either from over diuresis
or from worsening heart failure and hypovolemic hyponatremia.
On [**7-29**], the patient had an episode of extreme hypotension
and severe respiratory distress which was again thought to be
acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Again, the patient had
not been significantly diuresed even since admission.  During
this acute decompensation required
