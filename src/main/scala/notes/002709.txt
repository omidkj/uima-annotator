.
In ED, expressed LBP, mild headache, no neck pain.

Imaging:
[**12-15**] ECG  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Probable left anterior fascicular block. Delayed R wave
progression with late precordial QRS transition is
non-diagnostic but cannot exclude possible prior anterior wall
myocardial infarction. Modest lateral lead ST-T wave changes are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2196-12-11**] the
ventricular rate is faster and axis appears more leftward but
there may be no significant change.

[**12-11**] CT Chest/Abd/pelvis 1. Extensive multifocal airspace
opacities in the lungs as described along with small bilateral
pleural effusions. Findings are suggestive of a multifocal
pneumonia. 2. Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, likely
reactive. 3. Indeterminate 7 mm calculus in the abdomen, which
may be within the right renal pelvis or represent a vascular
calcification. Of note, there is no hydronephrosis.

[**12-11**] MRI L-spine  1. Multilevel lumbar spine spondylosis
without severe spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.  2. A
broad-based disc protrusion is present at the L4-L5 level with
minimal inferior migration resulting in mild spinal canal
narrowing and bilateral subarticular zone narrowing with
deformity on the L5 nerves. 3. Moderate bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing is present at the L5-S1 level due to facet
arthrosis with impingement on the L5 nerves.  Study is limited
for abnormal enhancement due to lack of post Gado imaging, gado
could not eb given due to low eGFR.

[**12-7**] abd u/s This is a technically limited study showing a
normal size of the liver and spleen. No focal abnormality is
seen. Limited views of the kidneys show no hydronephrosis, but
as
