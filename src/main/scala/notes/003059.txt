History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 YOM with PMHX significant for CAD, HTN, smoking,
hyperlipidemia who presents in shock. He was well until 5 days
PTA. Per his family he had onset of abdominal pain/indigestion
(similar to 1st ACS presentation). They are unaware of the
nature of the pain or if he had any other symptoms including
fevers, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or dysuria. He
was taken by his girldriend to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED for evaluation
[**2172-4-29**]. At their ED his intial vitals were, T 98.7 HR 110 BP
116/83 RR 18 and 99% on RA. PEr their ED records he complained
of orthopnea, denied N/V, chest pain, palps, fevers. The
abdominal pain was characterized as gradual onset, constent,
[**4-30**], and diffuse in location. Their exam noted mild tenderness
in LLQ and normal cardipulmonary exam aside from tachycardia.He
was found to have an elevated WBC count and treated with
levo/flagyl empirically for presumed diverticulitis. EKG
revealed afib with rate of 171. nl axis. TWI in V5 V6. He was
given a total of 25 mg IV diltiazem, 30 mg po, atenolol 50 mg
po. His pulse then dropped to 70 and SBP to 40. He was then
intubated and started on dopamine. Dopamine titrated up to 20
mcg with SBP still in the 50s. He then also started on levophed
and given a total of 8L of NS. Pressures then to 113 systolic.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were HR 116, BP 113/96.
He was not making urine. A right IJ triple lumen was placed. He
was given 1g of vancomycin. Dopamine switched to dobutamine with
out significant improvement in urine output. He was also given 1
amp of bicarb for pH of 7.11.

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2-23**] anatomy as follows:

1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system with single-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease.  The LAD had no angiographically apparent
disease.
The LCx had a proximal 30% ulcerated plaque and the large first
OM was occluded proximally.  The RCA had minor diffuse plaquing
and the posterolateral branch had a distal 60% stenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a moderately elevated
left-sided filling pressure of 28 mmHg.  There was no gradient
across
the aortic valve on pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed no significant mitral
regurgitation, normal wall motion, and a calculated ejection
fraction of 60%.
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the totally occluded OM1
with a 2.5x 8 mm Cypher DES. Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow in
the vessel .

.
CXR: There is a new right central venous catheter terminating in
the superior vena cava.  The nasogastric tube projects only
immediately beyond the hemidiaphragms and a side hole is within
the distal esophagus.  Advancing the tube is recommended into
the stomach.  Patient remains intubated.  There is distention of
the azygos vein and vascular pedicle, as well as marked
cardiomegaly and a small effusion.
.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are bibasilar
atelectases and effusions.  There is fatty infiltration of the
liver.  There is dense material throughout the gallbladder,
which is nondistended, which may represent sludge, and less
intravenous contrast was administered recently, which could
suggest vicarious excretion.  The spleen is normal in size.  The
pancreas is somewhat atrophic.  The kidneys show a small 2-mm
calcification on the right, which may be vascular or tiny
nonobstructing stone.  The adrenal glands are within normal
limits.  The bowel is not dilated, and there is a full
thickening of the small bowel, as well as stranding in the
retroperitoneum and ascites, all  of this could be explained by
fluid overload.
There is fatty infiltration of the wall of the ascending colon,
which is suggestive of chronic inflammation.
There is stranding focussed in the central mesentery.
Although nondistended jejunal folds appear thickened, and more
distally the bowel is collapsed.
There is marked diverticulosis, but no evidence of
diverticulitis.
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter
in the bladder.  Rectum appears normal.  Severe diverticulosis
is noted.  There is fairly extensive fatty hypertrophy of the
perirectal fat.
.
RUQ U/S  WET READ No gallstones or gallbladder distension. Wall
edema may be due to anasarca. Fatty liver.

[**2172-4-30**] Echo:
Conclusions:  No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body
of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Impression: No [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA thrombus. Severely depressed LV
function. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

[**2172-5-7**] CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. There
is no hydrocephalus. Osseous structures and soft tissues are
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: no hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial infarct.
.

TTE [**2172-5-7**]: EF 30%. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+)
