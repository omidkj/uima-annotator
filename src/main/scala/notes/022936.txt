History of Present Illness:
74 yo F with h/o recent R craniotomy, atrial fibrillation, CHF
who presented from NE [**Hospital1 **] with hypoxia, hemoptysis and
hypotension. She had been recently admitted to the neurosurg
service for chronic SDH s/p R craniotomy on [**2180-7-22**]. She had a 3
week hospital stay complicated by diffuculty weaning from the
vent and MRSA pneumonia with eventual placement of trach on
[**2180-8-1**]. She received a 14 day course of vanco. Family notes
increased agitation over past few days. At rehab, she was
started on ceftazidime, vanco and levo on [**2180-8-19**] for pneumonia.
She was given one unit of PRBC on day of admission.

In ED: T 100.7, hypotensive to SBP in 80's, HR 90's and hypoxic
with SPO2 initially of 70%, ABG of 7.45/52/45 on 70%. HR in
100's, RR 26. She was placed on AC 450/12, Fio2 100%, PEEP 10.
She was given 3.5L NS and was started on neosynephrine. CT chest
was done that showed bl patchy opacities and subsegmental PE.


Past Medical History:
PMH: afib, High cholesterol, endocarditis, constrictive
pericarditis, CHF, right eye blind.
PSH: Recent craniotomy with evacuation of acute on chronic
subdural hematoma, tracheostomy [**2180-8-1**], PEG placed on [**8-10**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 74 yo female s.p recent SDH with craniotomy admitted from
rehab with hypoxia, transient hypotension, hemoptysis.

1. Hypoxia:

This was likely multifactorial with contributions from
MRSA pneumonia, congestive hear failure/pulmonary edema,
as well as new diagnosis of segmental pulmonary embolism.
Concerning her MRSA pneumonia, she was treated with a
(total 10 day) course of vancomycin and zosyn. She
remained afebrile and white count trended down.
Concerning her congestive heart failure, she was
managed initially with a lasix drip with aggressive
diuresis. She was then transitioned to prn IV lasix.
Concerning her PE, she had no evidence of DVT in her
lower extremities by doppler US studies. She was initially
not placed on treatment dose of heparin, as she had
just recently had a subdural hematoma evacuated.
However, Neurosurgery stated that the patient could start
anti-coagulation prior to d/c. The risks and benefits of
starting anticoagulation in a patient with PE, afib, recent
subdural hematoma, and possible hypercoagulable state due to
malignancy were discussed by the team with the patient's family.
It was decided that
the patient should be discharged to rehab on lovenox alone and
she was started on
80 mg SC BID of lovenox. The decision to continue
anticoagulation will be deferred to the rehab medical team in
conjunction with her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] remained
hemodynamically stable, and she was
progressively weaned from mechanical ventilatory
support over her ICU stay. Some of patient's medications were
held,
including ambien, sertraline and meclizine while patient was in
the
hospital out of concern for patient's MS.  These can likely be
re-started as an outpatient when patient's mental status
improves.
She was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2180-9-2**].

.

2. Hypotension

This was self-limited, and she thereafter remained normotensive.

She had received IVF bolus and was transiently on neosynephrine.

There was no evidence of sepsis.

.

3. Anemia

Consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Remained stable through ICU course.

.

4. Diffuse Lymphadenopathy

She had newly recognized diffuse pathologic lymphadenopathy
by CT of chest/abd/pelvis. This included hilar, retroperitoneal,
pelvic/inguinal regions.  The lymphadenopathy in the inguinal
region was accessible for biopsy. She underwent US-guided lymph
node biopsy for tissue diagnosis on [**2180-9-1**].  Results were
pending
on discharge. She was informed that her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], should
follow up
on the results of this biopsy. A copy of this d/c summary will
be sent to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

.

5. Congestive heart failure

With preserved EF. Was aggressively diuresed
during ICU stay. In long term, she will
need further evaluation and definitive
treatment for constrictive pericarditis.
Discharge regimen included lasix 60mg po BID.

.

6. Access

R. subclavian triple lumen central line placed
on [**2180-8-22**]. Pulled on [**2180-9-2**] prior to D/c.
PEG pulled by patient; replaced by IR during hospital course.
Patient to have sutures around G-tube pulled 5 days after d/c
per IR.
Instructions for pulling the sutures were included in the page
1.
