Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
PEA Arrest at [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 y/o male with PMHx of CAD, CHF, PVD with stent leg (?
L or R), HTN, DM2, carotid artery disease, who was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after a PEA arrest. Per family, patient was at
home at kitchen table when he experienced sudden onset chest
pain and family called EMS. Pt went into PEA arrest and was
given 1 round of epi and atropine and then had ROSC. OSH was
worried about STEMI (for unclear reasons at this point) and
their lab was unavailable so patient was transferred over to
[**Hospital1 18**] where he went to cath lab. The RCA was totally occluded
but collaterals from Left were noted. RHC showed elevated wedge
(30s), RA pressures 15, PAP 60. Echo in lab showed moderate MR,
mild AI, preserved LV, RV function. Calcified AV. Received lasix
IV in lab 80 mg. LV gram showed mild MR, inferiobasal HK with EF
about 45%. AS study showed moderate-severe AS with valve area
1.0. Chronic occlusion of RCA and 80% prox LAD with good flow
through LAD and LCx. No intervention performed. PA pressure at
80 and wedge pressures a 30-35
Patient was transferred up to CCU and additional history was
performed. Per daughter and wife, patient was experiencing on
and off chest pains since [**Month (only) 404**] with associated L arm
numbness. Daughter would see him lefting his left arm up with
the right as he couldn't move it voluntarily during these
episodes. Also having severe SOB, especially while sleeping-
severe orthopnea per daughter, also significant bilateral
pitting edema. PCP had recently increased his lasix dose from
20mg to 40mg daily. He also recently went to an urgent care
clinic 4 days prior to presentation and was given Azithromycin
for presumed CAP.
Art line placed upon transfer to CCU. Hypotensive to Systolic
80s-90s when sleeping and after fentanyl injections but
increases upon awakening. Patient -1 L since cath lab. Started
on lasix gtt at 5/hr
.

FINDINGS:  On the right side the known occlusion of the internal
carotid
artery is confirmed.  On left side a mild amount of calcified
plaque is seen
in the common and internal carotid arteries.

On the right side peak systolic velocities were 24 cm/sec for
the common
carotid artery and 203 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.

No ICA/CCA ratio could be determined on the right side due to
complete
occlusion of the internal carotid artery.

On the left side peak systolic velocities were 75 cm/sec for the
proximal
internal carotid artery, 106 cm/sec for the mid internal carotid
artery, 100
cm/sec for the distal internal carotid artery and 55 cm/sec for
the common
carotid artery.  The left ICA/CCA ratio was 2.0.

Vertebral arteries presented antegrade flow.

COMPARISON:  None available.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Occlusion of the right internal carotid artery.
2.  Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

CTA LOWER EXTREMITIES:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Filling defect in a moderate segment of the right
superficial femoral
artery may represent thrombus versus dissection.  This was
discussed with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by phone at 10:20 a.m. on [**2195-7-5**] after
attending review.
2.  Occluded dorsalis pedis and plantar arteries in the right
foot.
3.  Significant atherosclerotic disease in the lower extremity
vasculature as
described above.
4.  Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 y/o male with PMHx of Ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe AS,
Severe PVD and other medical comorbidities admitted after PEA
arrest with CHF exacerbation s/p diuresis and hemodynamic
optimization

# PUMP: ECHO shows LVEF of 45% with mild MR and AS.  The patient
was aggressively diuresed and put on nitro gtt titrated to
appropriate BPs while in the ICU.  He was optimized
hemodynamically with captopril and metoprolol tartrate.  These
medications were then switched to Lisinopril 10 mg daily and PO
Lasix as well as Sprironolactone.  Patient was over net 6.5 L
out, on nasal cannula and discharge.

# CORONARIES: The patient was originally billed as a STEMI when
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and sent directly to cath lab where 80%
occlusion of LAD, 40% LCx, and 100% RCA although with adequate
collaterals were found.  Given the collaterals supported
adequate flow, the CAD was thought to be chronic in nature and
no intervention was performed in cath lab.  ST depressions noted
on EKGs from OSH. The patient was placed on heparin. The patient
refused CABG but will discuss the issue further with his
outpatient cardiologist. Carotid ultrasound was obtained for
pre-op evaluation should the patient decide to pursue coronary
artery bypass. The right carotid was found to be occluded and
the left 40% stenosed. Aspirin and atorvastatin were continued.
The patient's heparin was discontinued on [**7-11**] as the patient's
clinica
