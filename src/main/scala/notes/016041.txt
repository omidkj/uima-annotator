ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 54184**] is a 69-year-old
female with end stage renal disease and a history of coronary
artery disease and peripheral vascular disease who was
initially admitted to the vascular surgery service for
necrosis of her right great toe and right lower extremity
claudication. Upon her admission to the vascular service, she
was noted no examination to be afebrile and otherwise
hemodynamically normal. Her carotid pulses were 1+, but she
had palpable 1+ femoral pulses but otherwise no palpable
popliteal, dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally. She did have a monophasic signal on the left
dorsalis pedis pulse.

Her admission exam was otherwise notable for slight fullness
of the right lower extremity with a purple-black necrotic
right great toe with dry gangrene. When she came in her white
blood cell count was 7.6 with a hematocrit of 33.8. Her
potassium was 5.7 which is hemolyzed and on repeat check was
5.0 with a BUN and creatinine of 40 and 8.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted as noted above to
the vascular surgery service at which time preprocedural
workup was undertaken for evaluation and possible
revascularization of her lower extremity. At this time it was
noted that she did have significant 3-vessel coronary artery
disease for which she had declined operative intervention in
the past but it is felt that this issue needed to be
addressed at this time, and therefore cardiology consultation
was obtained and the patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed significant 3-vessel disease
which was not amenable to percutaneous intervention. She had
an ejection fraction of 45% with 70% distal lesion of her
LMCA. The left anterior descending coronary artery was
occluded and the left circumflex coronary artery showed 70%
disease to the proximal and mid lesions and the RCA had
subtotal ostial and proximal occlusion with the distal vessel
severely diseased. It is decided at this time the patient's
best option would be coronary artery bypass grafting and
therefore cardiac surgery was consulted. After discussing the
patient's options for operative and nonoperative management
she agreed to undergo bypass grafting and was therefore taken
to the operating room on [**2121-4-8**], at which time she had
a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass graft performed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. One graft was the LIMA to the LAD and the second was
the SVG to the OM. Please see the operative notes for further
details of that procedure. To note, a third bypass was not
completed secondary to poor target vessels and the diffuse
nature of the coronary artery disease in those vessels.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was taken and
admitted to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit where she
was extubated on postoperative day #0. She did quite well
initially with routine postoperative management which
included removal of chest tubes and aggressive fluid removal
which was accomplished via hemodialysis. Early in the morning
of postoperative day #2, the patient was noted to have what
was initially thought to be an asystolic event but was on
later investigation found to be in complete heart block which
required reactivation of her epicardial pacing wires for
maintenance of her rhythm. She was hemodynamically stable
with reactivation with her pacer wires and it is at this time
that the electrophysiology service was consulted for possible
insertion of a pacemaker and for advisement on further
management. It was their recommendation to withhold all beta
blockade and to insert a pacemaker at some point during the
patient's hospitalization but given the fear of infection of
the pacemaker, they felt it would be best to wait until the
patient's immediate postoperative care became less acute at
which time central access catheters could be removed to
reduce the risk of infection. We therefore continued standard
medical management postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 54184**] to continue
with her hemodialysis per routine as per the nephrology
service. She notably had a brief period of atrial
fibrillation on postoperative day #5 but this resolved and by
the time of discharge she was in a sinus rhythm.

On [**2121-4-14**], the patient underwent electrophysiology
studies which again confirmed the presence of complete heart
block as her underlying rhythm without the use of pacer
wires. She was subsequently scheduled for pacemaker insertion
prior to discharge. Her initial problem of right lower
extremity ischemia was treated with right superficial femoral
artery angioplasty of the proximal and mid segments on [**2121-4-15**], by the vascular surgery service. She underwent this
procedure with no intraprocedural complications. On [**2121-4-17**], the patient underwent implantation of a dual chamber
[**Company 1543**] Enpulse Pacemaker without intraprocedural
complications. She was subsequently ready for discharge but
her left AV graft thrombosed and she therefore no longer had
hemodialysis access. The transplant surgery service was
consulted at this time and she was taken for thrombectomy of
the left forearm loop AV graft on [**2121-4-18**]. She
tolerated this procedure well and had good flow in her graft
postprocedurally and was actually able to dialyze 2 times but
unfortunately the graft clotted off again requiring
reoperation with thrombectomy and revision of her AV graft.
Subsequent to this, the patient did well and had no further
complications of graft thrombosis and was dialyzed per
routine. It was felt that as the patient had been afebrile
and otherwise hemodynamically stable with her new pacer and
on a stable regimen of her cardiac medications and stable
hemodialysis regimen, that she would be safe for discharge on
[**2121-4-23**]. Her white blood cell count was 10.0 at this
time with a hematocrit of 32 and she was on a heparin drip to
keep a goal INR of 2.0 for a multitude of factors which
included recurrent thrombosis of her AV graft, her coronary
artery disease and her peripheral vascular disease. Her goal
INR on Coumadin was to be 2.0. Her BUN and creatinine at the
time of discharge were 40 and 10.6 with a potassium of 4.9.
She was discharged on the following medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace as needed.
2. Zantac 150 mg p.o. once daily.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
4. Tylenol as needed.
5. Percocet 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for pain.
6. Plavix 75 mg once a day.
7. Oxazepam 15 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
9. Coumadin daily dosing for goal INR of 2.0 and a heparin
   drip until her INR became therapeutic.



DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to rehab
in good condition.
