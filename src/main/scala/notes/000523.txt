[**2-7**] Echo: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic annulus
is 22 cm. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis
(area 1.0-1.5cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 7.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid annulus is 3.2
cm. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results. POST-CPB:
On infusion of milrinone, phenylephrine. Apacing for slow sinus
rhythm. Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF now 50 %
on inotropic support. 1. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the
mitral position. No MR, no paravalvular leak. Transmitral
gradient is 11 mmHg with a mean of 6 at the time the cardiac
output is 7.6 L/min. 2. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the
aortic position with no AI, no paravalvular leak. Good flow is
seen in the left main coronary artery. Unable to obtain
transgastric views due to a hiatal hernia, so unable to
calculate gradients across the aortic valve. 3. Well-seated ring
in the tricuspid position with trace TR. 4. Descending aortic
contour appears normal post decannulation.
[**2-6**] CT: 1. Enlarged left atrium. 2. Large hiatal hernia
involving almost all the stomach and part of the colonic splenic
flexure, with the left inferior pulmonary vein sitting just
above it. 3. Grade I anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 and scoliosis.
4. 1-mm left upper lobe nodule, does not warrant further
followup if the patient has no risk factor for malignancy.
5. Bibasilar ground-glass opacity, could be atelectasis or
chronic aspiration given the history of large hiatus hernia.

Final Report
INDICATION: PICC placement.

FINDINGS: A new left-sided PICC terminates in the SVC. As
compared to
[**2137-2-12**], there has been marked improvement of now only
mild
pulmonary edema. Large left lower lobe atelectasis and small
pleural effusion
are unchanged. The patient is status post aortic valve, mitral
valve, and
tricuspid valvular repair.

IMPRESSION: PICC in SVC.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2-5**] for IV heparin for Afib and to complete pre-op
workup. CT chest/abd done with thoracic surgery consult to
evaluate large hiatal hernia. On [**2-7**] she underwent Aortic valve
replacement (#23 mm [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial )/Mitral Valve
Replacement (#29mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue valve)/Tricuspid Valve repair
(#28,,[**Doctor Last Name **] MC3 annuloplasty)/MAZE. Cross clamp time: 137
minutes,Cardiopulmonary bypass time: 179 minutes.Please see
Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative report for further surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable but critical condition. Within 24 hours she
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. She was initially requiring inotropic/pressor support
to optimise her cardiac output. She remained hemodynamically
stable and was successfully weaned off Milrinone and Neo drips.
All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion. She
was transfused with red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
Ms.[**Known lastname 19849**] did complain of severe pain which was treated with a
dilaudid infusion. Aggressive diuresis was initiated. She had
moments of extreme aggitation which was treated with haldol and
ativan. As her daughter had reported she consumed daily alcohol,
thiamine and folic acid were started. Multiple inhalers were
used for worsening atelectasis and a high oxygen requirement.
Postoperatively, Beta-blocker and aspirin were initiated. [**2-10**]
anticoagulation was initiated with Coumadin for her MAZE
procedure. Her INR levels subsequently increased to 7.5.
Ms.[**Known lastname 19849**] was given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to correct
this level and Coumadin was held. On [**2-13**] her rhythm went into
atrial fibrillation. Given her continued
