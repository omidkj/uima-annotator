Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old male with CLL x 20 years most
recently treated with 6 cycles R-CVP admitted from ED with URI
symptoms with fevers to 101, chills, fatigue x 7 days, 2-3 days
of dry cough, and hemoptysis x 1 day (approx several
tablespoons) associated with SOB. Of note, him and his wife have

transfused 1 unit PRBCs and given IVF with bicarb prior to CTA
which was negative for PE but which revealed slightly increased
in size L lung masses. he was also given ativan, benadryl and
nebs for agitation and tachypnea. VS prior to transfer: 99.4 111

CTA: Multiple masses compatible with known CLL. No PE, no edema,
no evidence of superimposed PNA. R paratracheal 8.5x7 cm mass.
Subcarinal conglomerate 5.5x3.4cm. Left hilar conglomerate
measuring 4x3.7cm. LLL mass stable in size 3.7x3.7cm. No e/o PE
or acute aortic process. No pulmonary edema. No new
consolidation. Trace left pleural effusion stable. Interval
enlargement of spleen
.
EKG: Sinus tach HR 105. LAD. prolonged PR 200msec. 1mm ST dep
V2-V4. No other ST or TW changes. Similar to prior.

RUE U/S [**1-24**]
 Occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein, without evidence
of clot extension to other veins. No DVT.

Head CT [**1-20**]
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, shift of
normally midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial
infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, likely reflective of
atrophy. Patchy opacification of the right inferior mastoid air
cells are noted. Otherwise, visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are normally aerated. Osseous structures
reveal no evidence of fracture.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old male with known CLL presenting with fevers, cough
and hemoptysis with increased interval size of known lung masses
on CT.

# Hemoptysis: Initially thought to be related to underlying
infection and bronchitis vs effect from known malignancy. His
CTA was negative for PE.  He was started on levo initially, and
vanc/cefepime were added for broader coverage.  Upon review of
CTA w/ radiologist there was concern for large LLL node that is
abutting pulm vasculature as source of bleeding. He underwent
bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from thrombus /
mass lesion in LLL lobe which initially required intubation;
