lesion.

A chest x-ray on [**12-10**] showed resolution of a left

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2142-12-6**] for a coronary artery bypass graft times
two by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].  The patient had a left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit on Levophed and propofol
infusions.

The patient's postoperative ejection fraction improved from
preoperative of 30% to 35% to postoperative of 45%.  The

The patient was restarted on diuretics and asthma
medications.

The patient required intermittent nebulizer treatments for
wheezing.  The patient felt that this was not significantly
from his preoperative albuterol requirements.  The patient's
blood sugar remained under good control.

the Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor where he was
ambulating with Physical Therapy.  The patient's chest tubes
and pacing wires were removed.

On postoperative day five, the patient was anxious to be
discharged to home.  The patient was able to clear a level V
physical therapy which required walking 500 feet and climbing
one flight of stairs without difficulty.  The patient did
have some exertional wheezes which responded to the use of
his albuterol meter-dosed inhaler, and it was decided that
the patient was stable for discharge to home.

revealed the patient's temperature maximum was 98.9 degrees
Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 84 (sinus rhythm), his blood
pressure was 130/70, his respiratory rate was 16, and his
oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.  Neurologically, the
patient was alert, awake, and oriented times three.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  There was a positive rub.  No murmurs.  Respiratory
examination revealed scattered wheezes bilaterally with
exertion.  No rhonchi.  No rales.  Gastrointestinal
examination revealed the abdomen was obese with positive
bowel sounds.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  The patient was tolerating a regular diet and
was having normal bowel movements.  Sternal incision revealed
Steri-Strips were intact.  The sternum was stable.  There was
no erythema or drainage.  The patient had a scant amount of
drainage from the medial chest tube site.  There was no
