Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Presenting for revascularzation of left leg.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lower Extremity Vascular Cath x 2


History of Present Illness:
86 y/o female with PMH significant for PVD and chronic renal
failure admitted for planned percutaneous revascularization of
the left leg. Pt initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on
0/29 with three to four weeks of claudication that had
progressed to rest pain. Work up at [**Hospital1 1474**] included bilateral
carotid US that showed 80 to 99% stenosis and ABIs that were
consistent with claudictaion. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] at
that time and received a stent to the [**Country **]. At that time, her
hospital course was complicated by renal failure secondary to
the dye load from her cath. Pt then returned to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**1-9**]
to [**1-13**] for the SFA stent and this went well with no renal
failure.

At this point of time the patients only complaint is pain in her
L leg.  The pain is greatest in her foot but also involves her L
posterior thigh.  Otherwise the patient feels well and denies:
CP, SOB, N/V, Abd pain, problems with urination or bowel
function, fevers, chills, palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.

Past Medical History:
1. PVD s/p left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, stent to the [**Country **], and stent to
the right SFA.
2. HTN
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. CAD
5. CHF
6. Bilateral heel ulcers
7. Chronic renal failure
8. Former smoker- quit 40 years ago
9. Former ETOH abuse- quit 40 years ago
10. Glaucoma


Social History:
Former smoker, quit 40 years ago.  She has a 60-75 pack-year
history.  She also quit drinking alcohol 40 years ago, and had a
problem with EtOH abuse.

Family History:
Her father had PVD and CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 y/o female with PMH significant for PVD and chronic renal
failure admitted for planned percutaneous revascularization of
the left leg.

Patient with severe PVD resulting in necrosis of the feet.  She
has already had procedures to her R leg with reestablishment of
blood flow.  The patient was first taken to cath and found to
have a great deal of thrombus in the L leg.  She was cathed with
atents to the [**Last Name (LF) 32365**], [**First Name3 (LF) 7195**] and LCFA.  A catheter was left in
overnight for a slow infusion of TPA.  She was kept in the CCU
during this infusion.  Then she was brought back to the cath lab
where the DP was opened using PTCA.  After this the patient's L
foot became less mottled and had dopplerable fellow.  After the
second procedure the patient was found to have a decreased
mental status and difficult to control blood pressure.  She was
also found to have a fever and a white count.

By Issue:
**Hypertension - She was having SBP's in the 180's to 200's
following the second procedure.  Blood pressure goal in the unit
was 160 in order to properly perfuse the leg.  Lopressor was not
successful in controling her blood pressure.  Diltiazem was much
more effective.  She was brought down to the 160's using
diltiazem and hydralazine.  By the next morning the patient was
awake enough to take po meds.  Her oral meds were titrated up to
keep her blood pressure in the 130 to 140 range.  The blood
pressure goal ia a compromise between having high enough
pressure to perfuse her foot but not too high to rupture the
cath site.  The patients BP meds have been steadily titrated up
with good effect although her BP at discharge was still slightly
high in the 150's.

**Infection - Patient was admitted with a UTI being treated with
levofloxacin.  Patient spiked a fever on [**1-18**] and was started
on zosyn.  Her prior urine culture [**1-17**] grew Klebsiella,
resistant to levo and sensitive to zosyn.  Also she was found to
have a pneumonia LLL on CXR.  Furthermore, the patient was found
to have a MRSA infection on bedside wound swab.  She was also
started on vancomycin.  Unfortunately the patient can not have
an MRI due to her stents so osteo is difficult to rule out.  The
patient will need to continue zosyn for a total of 2 weeks and
vancomycin for a total of 6 weeks.

**Mental Status - Upon returning from the cath lab for the
second time the patient has a severe waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of mental
status consistent with delerium on top of her baseline mild
dementia.  She ranged from aggitated (screaming at nurses) to
somnolent (barely arousable).  A non-contrast head CT was
performed given the high blood pressures and recent TPA infusion
which was negative for mass or bleed.  Neuro was also consulted
and felt the patient had a toxic metabolic delerium rather than
a stroke.  The patient defervesed on zosyn and her mental status
improved.  By the morning of [**1-22**], she was back to her slight
baseline dementia.

2) CAD - Pt has a history of CAD.  Enzymes were cycled for T
wave flattening and were negative.  Patient continued on [**Date Range **],
lipitor, plavix.  Also her BP meds were continued includine a
bblocker, ACE, and, imdur.

3) Glaucoma - Continued on brimonidine drops.
