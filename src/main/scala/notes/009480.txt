Imaging:
CT Head [**4-28**]:
FINDINGS: There is a large mixed density intraparenchymal blood
collection in the left parietotemporal lobe measuring 7.6 x 3.3
cm in axial dimensions and consistent with acute hemorrhage.
This lesion demonstrates surrounding edema. There is a 5-mm
rightward shift of normally midline structures and subfalcine
herniation. There is diffuse effacement of the sulci in the left
cerebral hemisphere and the left lateral ventricle. There is no
entrapment of the right lateral ventricle or uncal herniation.
There is a second focus of acute hemorrhage in the right
inferior frontal lobe measuring 1.1 x 1.5 cm. In addition, there
are scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right
temporal and left frontal and parietal lobes. There is no major
vascular territory infarction. Mucosal thickening in the left
maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses is noted. There is a mucous
retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. No osseous
abnormality is detected.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
associated
mass effect including 5 mm rightward shift of the normally
midline structures and subfalcine herniation.
2. Focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right inferior
frontal lobe.
3. Scattered areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage bilaterally.
4. Maxillary and ethmoidal sinus disease.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**4-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, or
pelvic injury.
2. 2-mm nodule in the left lower lobe. According to the
[**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society
criteria, if the patient is at low risk for malignancy, no
further followup is needed. If the patient is at high risk for
malignancy, CT followup in 12 months is recommended, and if
unchanged at that time, no additional followup is recommended.
3. Probable remote bilateral clavicular fractures and right and
left rib
fractures.
4. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
5. 4-mm hypodensity in the left renal cortex which is too small
to
characterize, but likely a simple cyst.

Head CTA [**4-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aneurysm or other vascular malformation.
2. Complete right ICA occlusion, likely at the origin.

MRI C-Spine [**4-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of ligamentous injury in the cervical spine.
2. Multilevel degenerative change as detailed above, most severe
at C5/6. No sign of cord signal abnormality.

CT L-Spine [**4-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or lumbar spine malalignment.
2. Multilevel degenerative change as detailed above.

CT T-Spine [**4-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or thoracic spine malalignment.
2. Fatty liver.

EKG [**4-28**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Low limb lead voltage. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.

CXR [**4-28**]:
SINGLE SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The endotracheal tube
terminates
approximately 7.5 cm from the carina. The lungs are clear
without focal
consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart size
is normal.
There is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. There is bilateral
clavicular
deformity which may be related to prior trauma. An NG tube is
noted projecting out of the field of view in the left upper
abdomen.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube 7.5 cm from the carina. Consider
repositioning.

CXR [**4-30**]:
FINDINGS:
Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2140-4-28**]. Endotracheal
tube
terminates 4.2 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinum otherwise
normal.
Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. There is mild
atelectasis at both lung bases. Remainder of the lungs are
clear. No frank infiltrate to suggest aspiration at this time.
There is an old right clavicular deformity.

Non-Invasive Ultrasound Studies:
[**5-7**]:IMPRESSION: No DVT of the right upper extremity.
[**5-8**]: DVT in the right superficial femoral vein which is
occlusive.

Head CT [**5-7**]:
FINDINGS: There is evolution of hemorrhage in the left frontal
craniotomy bed with decreasing air in the post-surgical bed.
Large vasogenic edema adjacent to the hemorrhage with moderate
mass effect on the ipsilateral left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is similar to
[**2140-5-6**]. Right inferior frontal lobe hemorrhage is similar to
[**2140-5-6**]. There is stable minimal right frontal subarachnoid
hemorrhage. 7mm rightward shift of normally midline structures,
left subfalcine and uncal herniation are similar to [**2140-5-6**].
Bilateral pneumocephalus has slightly decreased since [**2140-5-6**].
Opacification of the left frontal sinus, the sphenoid sinus,
bilateral ethmoids and left maxillary sinuses are similar to
[**2140-5-6**].
The mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolution of left parietoemporal parenchymal hemorrhage with
large edema
and subfalcine as well as uncal herniation that is similar to
[**2140-5-6**].
2. Evolution of R inferior frontal lobe hemorrhage unchanged
since [**2140-5-6**].
3. Diffuse paranasal sinus opacification is unchanged since
[**2140-5-6**].

IVC Filter placement [**5-9**]:
PFI: Placement of G2 retrievable infrarenal IVC filter. The
filter can be
retrieved at any time as needed.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU after having been intubated
and sedated. He was not opening his eyes and was not following
commands upon admission. He was however, able to move all 4
extremities to noxious stimuli. On [**4-28**] he had a CTA showing no
aneurysm or AVM. There was complete right ICA occulsion but
there was collateral flow.

On [**5-2**] there was a question of a self-resolving focal seizure
in the LUE so keppra was started. He underwent craniotomy for
evacuation of hematoma on [**2140-5-2**]. The patient was able to move
his extremities spontaneously and started to follow commands
with the LUE post-operatively. He was also able to open his
eyes. The patient was able to tolerate some time on trach mask
but still required the ventilator at night.

On [**5-5**] the patient had been on the trach mask for over 24
hours. He was tracking with his eyes and moving his LUE and
lowers spontaneously and the RUE had slight withdrawal.

On [**5-7**] the patient had a stat head CT due to a period of
unresponsiveness. The scan was unchanged and the patient's exam
improved subsequently. He had blood and urine cultures drawn for
