Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Lorazepam

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for head bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation.

History of Present Illness:
82 yo right handed man with a history of previous ICH with no
residual deficits (see PMHx) who was in his USOH until the
morning of [**2104-2-21**]. He awoke at 5:30am with a terrible
headache, not relieved with tylenol. His wife noted that he had
no difficulty walking or talking or coordinating movements. She
called EMS after his headachepersisted despite tylenol as his
last ICH presented with a headache. His BP by EMS was 212/p HR
65 RR 18.  At [**Location (un) 620**] he was found to have ICH and thus
electively intubated for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical
backup. Meds given:  vecuronium, fentanyl, lidocaine, etoposide,
succinylcholine, loaded with dilantin.   He was "A&Ox2, reactive
pupils, BP 155/73, HR 60, RR 16, 96% on RA, moving all
extremities equally" prior to intubation.

In the ED, patient was sedated on propofol and BP dropped to
86/43.  Propofol held and IVF given and BP increased to  136/68.
A-line in place. No BP lowering meds had been given.

Wife reports no falls or trauma, no anticoagulants, aspirin,
alternative medicines.  No fevers, chills, recent illnesses,
chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, GI bleeds, dysuria, or
incontinence (bowel or bladder).


Past Medical History:
1. Previous interventricular hemorrhage [**6-7**] that resolved as of
repeat head CT one month later. No residual deficits.  Was
admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**].
2.  pacemaker placement for arrhythmia
3.  history of slowness of gait, ?parkinsons? and possibly
dementia followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**]).  Sinemet was
stopped during last admission [**6-7**] as he was thought to NOT have
PD.
4.  Depression
5.  COPD
6.  High cholesterol?


Social History:
married, independent in ADLS, lives with wife in a retirement
community, + tob x 40 yrs x 1ppd, quit 20 yrs ago, occ glass of
wine, no drugs, retired architech. WIfe states that he would NOT
want to be recussitated, and that OSH placed ETT before asking
her.


Family History:
no kids, no bleeds or strokes in other family members

NEURO:
MENTAL STATUS: opens eyes to voice, awake, follows axial and
midline commands, ETT in place prohibits speech
CRANIAL NERVES:

NCHCT [**2104-2-21**]:  Again seen is an area of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema within the lateral aspect of
the right temporal lobe. Additionally, there is some asymmetric
thickening of the right tentorium, representing supratentorial
subdural hemorrhage, and foci of increased density seen within
the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally,
representing intraventricular hemorrhage. A small subdural
hemorrhage is also seen along the inner table of the right
parietal bone. All of these findings are unchanged in comparison
to the most recent study. The ventricular appearance is
unchanged. The shift of normally midline structures is stable.
The soft tissue and osseous structures are unchanged.

NCHCT [**2104-2-22**]: Again seen is a right temporal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, with associated subdural hematoma. These are not
changed. There is intraventricular hemorrhage, and this appears
to have increased in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], suggesting
interval bleeding since the prior exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage. 82 yo man with no history of
hypertension (in fact, took midodrine to keep BP up), who was
admitted to neurology with his 2nd intracranial hemorrhage.
Etiology for his intracranial bleeding is likely secondary to
amyloid given age and the location of bleed. This hemorrhage
extended to the ventricles and there are also subarachnoid and
subdural components. He was admitted to the ICU as he was
intubated electively at OSH for transfer.  Repeat head CT on
[**2104-2-22**] showed no change in bleed. In the ICU, he was extubated
the day after arrival, and BP was well controlled with PO
nimodipine.  Midodrine was held.  He did not require any IV meds
for BP control.  He was loaded with dilantin given presence of
bleed in the medial temporal lobe for seizure prophylaxis.
Repeat head CT in AM after admission showed no worsening of the
bleed.  (NOTE:  CANNOT get MRI due to pacemaker).  He ruled out
for MI.  Finger stick glucose readings were largely in the
normal range and were discontinued. He did not required insulin
for glycemic control. Cholesterol panel was checked and came
back with LDL 171 and total cholesterol >250. The patient was
started on Lipitor. His LFT's were normal. He will need to have
periodic LFT checks with statin therapy. The patient was
evaluated for speech and swallowing and found to have no
deficits with swallowing.  He was then resumed on po diet and
tolerated it well. Because of constellation of gait
abnormalities, incontinence and dementia LP was performed on
[**2104-2-26**] to rule out hydrocephalus. Opening pressure was 19 (with
legs bent) and his cognitive deficits (9 animal naming in 30
seconds pre- and post- tap; 2 "F" words pre- and 3 "F" words
post-tap; speed and gait unchanged) did not improve with
removing 30 cc of CSF. The patient was evaluated and followed by
an outside neurologist and was tried on Sinement in the past
given his gait abnormalities. Sinemet was later stopped for lack
of improvment.

Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was evaluated by PT and
OT who recommended rehabilitation after di
