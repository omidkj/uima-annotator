CXR [**2-25**] - Frontal view of the chest demonstrates appropriate
position of the endotracheal tube with tip approximately 3.5-cm
above the carina.  A right subclavian central catheter
terminates in the proximal SVC.  A nasogastric tube terminates
in the stomach. The heart size and mediastinal contours are
within normal limits.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
effusion, or pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
On initial evaluation in the ED, the pt was intubated for
hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. In the MICU, the pt
was treated with IV ceftazidime for pan-sensitive pseudomonas in
her sputum culture that was changed to levaquin 500 mg qdaily
once the pt was extubated. No focal infiltrates were noted on
CXR or CTA of the chest, thus it was thought that the
psuedomonas was likely causing a tracheobronchitis vs.
colonization. She remained AF during the hospital course. Given
her history, it was thought that her COPD exacerbation was
secondary to a chronic deterioration rather than an acute
precipitant and she was started on a prednisone taper while in
the ICU and placed on standing nebs with improvement. After
being successfully extubated, she was transferred to the floor
and continued on a steroid taper, levaquin for Pseudomonas, and
standing nebs. The pt was evaluated by PT and OT who felt that
she would most benefit from a respiratory rehab prior to d/c
home. She was discharged to rehab in good condition on 5L NC
(baseline home O2 2L NC).
