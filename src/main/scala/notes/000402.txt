bronchoscopy, Video assisted thoracoscopic thoracoscopy, Right
lower lobe superior segment and inferior right middle lobe wedge
resections.  He was monitored in the PACU prior to transfer to
the floor with a right chest-tube, foley and an epidural in
place managed by the acute pain service.  On POD #1 the epidural
removed and he was converted to PO pain medication with good
control.  The chest-tube was removed and a chest x-ray revealed
a collapsed right lower lobe and his oxygenation requirements
increased.  He was later transferred to the TSICU and was
bronched for a mucus plug.  A repeat film revealed a re-expanded
right lower lobe.  He was restarted on his parkinsion's
medication.  The foley was removed but was re-inserted for
urinary retention. Physical therapy was consulted to assist with
mobilization.  On POD #2 he transferred back to the floor.

He continued to progress, was ambulating with assistance,
tolerating a regular diet, urinating without difficulty, he is
discharged home with PT services
