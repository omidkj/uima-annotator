History of Present Illness:
69-year-old right-handed woman, with left facial spasms since
[**2163**], who is here in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic for an evalaution of
her enlarging left cerebellopontine angle meningioma. This
hemi-facial spasm developed slowly over time.  There is no pain.
She has vertex headache, mild nasuea but no vomiting, and mild
vertiginous sensation. She has lost hearing in the left ear. She
has numbness on the left side of her face.  She had a
gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2164-2-17**] at [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center
that showed a left cerebellopontine angle mass abutting the
exiting zone of the left 7th and 8th nerves. After that MRI, she
went back to [**Country 651**] and she came back to [**Location (un) 86**] in the fall of
[**2165**]. Her head MRI was repeated on [**2165-11-5**] and it showed slight
enlargement. She does not have imbalance, seizure, loss of
consciousness, or fall. She was electively admitted for a
craniotomy.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

Social History:
She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol

Family History:
Her parents died of old age. She has 5 siblings and they are all
healthy. She has 2 children and they are all healthy.

Physical Exam:
ADMISSION EXAM:
Physical Examination: Temperature is 98.0 F. Her blood pressure
is 140/72. Heart rate is 64. Respiratory rate is 20. Her skin
has full turgor. HEENT examination is unremarkable. Neck is
supple. Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.
Her lungs are clear. Her abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds.
Her extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Neurological Examination: Her Karnofsky Performance Score is 70.
She is awake, alert, and oriented times 3. There is no
right-left confusion or finger agnosia. Her language is fluent
in Chinese (there is an interpreter present) with good
comprehension, naming, and repetition. Her recent recall is
good. Cranial Nerve Examination: Her pupils are equal and
reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally. Extraocular
movements are full. Visual fields are full to confrontation.
Funduscopic examination reveals sharp disks margins bilaterally.
Her face is symmetric, but she has intermittent left hemi-facial
spasms. Facial sensation is intact on the right but decreased at
V1 and V2 and partially in V3. Her hearing is intact on the
right but lost completely on the left (Rinnie test shows loss of
neurosensory hearing). Her tongue is midline. Palate goes up in
the midline. Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are
strong. Motor Examination: She does not have a drift. Her muscle
strengths are [**5-28**] at all muscle groups. Her muscle tone is
normal. Her reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Her ankle
jerks are absent. Her toes are downgoing. Sensory
examination is intact to touch and proprioception. Coordination
examination does not reveal dysmetria. Her gait is normal. She
can do tandem. She does not have a Romberg.

ON DISCHARGE:
PERRLA, Follows simple commands with son's translation. Moves
all extremities purposefully. All surgical incision clean, dry,
intact. No sutures/staples intact.

Pertinent Results:
MR HEAD [**2166-3-20**]
IMPRESSION: Large left-sided CP angle mass essentially unchanged
from the
prior study.
CT HEAD [**2166-3-20**]:
There is no evidence of immediate post-surgical intracranial
hemorrhage. Patient is status post left occipital craniotomy
with a regional osseous defect and overlying metallic mesh. Soft
tissue in the posterior left occiput overlying this region
demonstrates edema and subcutaneous emphysema, as expected
post-surgically. Post-surgical pneumocephalus is also identified
within the left occipital region as well as within the
suprasellar cistern, in the left temporal, left frontal, and
right frontal regions. Left CP angle mass resection bed
demonstrates a small amount of low density fluid layering along
the left posterior fossa, with mild deviation of the posterior
fossa contents to the right. Mild effacement of the
quadrigeminal plate cistern and fourth ventricle are present on
the left, but decreased as compared to prior mass effect exerted
by the meningioma pre- surgically. Supratentorial cerebral
parenchyma appears normal without evidence of hemorrhage, mass
effect, or midline shift. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are aerated. No osseous defect in addition to surgical
defect as described.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute post-surgical intracranial
hemorrhage. Post- surgical changes as described.
MR HEAD [**2166-3-21**]
FINDINGS:
The patient is status post left suboccipital craniotomy for
resection of left CP angle meningioma. There is a postoperative
collection in the left lateral posterior fossa extending into
the CP angle cistern with mass effect on the brainstem and
cerebellum as well as shift of midline to the right. There is
mass effect on the fourth ventricle. Ventricular size is stable.
There is dural enhancement in the operative bed, which is felt
to be post-surgical.  There is also mild leptomeningeal
enhancement within the cerebellar folia, which is again
post-surgical.  A minimal amount of enhancement is noted along
the inferior most aspect of the left petrous ridge, image 22
series 9, which could represent venous sinus, but recommend
attention on followup imaging. There is tonsillar herniation,
which is unchanged compared to the preoperative study. There is
question of the neural hypointensity within the spinal cord on
the T1-weighted images. This appears to be new compared to the
prior MRI. Recommend dedicated MRI of the cervical spine for
further evaluation.
IMPRESSION:
Post-surgical changes status post resection of left CP angle
mass. No large area of residual neoplasm is seen. Question of
linear hypointensity in the cervical cord. Recommend dedicated
cervical spine MRI for further evaluation. No evidence for acute
ischemia.
CT HEAD [**2166-3-22**]
FINDINGS: There is interval placement of an intraventricular
drain with right transfrontal approach and the tip terminating
near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. Small amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage layering in the dependent portions of the bilateral
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and occipital horns, and tracking inferiorly to the
third ventricle and fourth ventricles. There is no significant
interval worsening of hydrocephalus. There is unchanged
tonsillar and ascending transtentorial herniation. Small amount
of air is noted in the anti-dependent position of the right
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and also the bifrontal extra-axial space.  A pocket
of air in the left posterior fossa anti-dependent position, with
the previously noted moderate extra-axial hemorrhage now
replaced by low-density fluid. The craniotomy flap is again
noted in the left occiput. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. Scattered opacification is noted in the ethmoid
sinuses.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of the intraventricular drainage catheter
via right
transfrontal approach with the tip terminating near the foramen
of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
2. No interval worsening hydrocephalus. No midline shift. Small
intraventricular hemorrhage in all ventricles, unchanged.
3. Interval removal of the extra-axial hemorrhage at left CP
angle.Hypodensity in the left brachium pontis likely secondary
to post
surgical changes although ischemia is not entirely excluded.
4. Expected post-procedural pneumocephalus.
CT HEAD [**2166-3-22**]
As compared to most recent prior study, craniotomy and
post-surgical changes in the left posterior fossa, with mildly
decreased air and fluid collection w
