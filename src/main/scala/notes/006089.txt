pleuritic chest pain, SOB, and fatigue.  Symptoms began 4 days
PTA w/ cough but did not worsen until 2 days PTA when patient
developed worsening cough, HA, fever/chills, and severe fatigue.
By the following day she developed right sided pleuritic chest
pain from her arm pit to her lower ribs radiating to the back.
This chest pain was worsened with cough and was accompanied by
SOB and palpitations.  Palpitations and SOB also worsened with

constipation, hematochezia, changes in her urination. Denies
photophobia, neck stiffness.

In the ED, she initially satted well but became more hypoxic
down to low 90s on 4LNC and was switched to NRB w/ increased O2
sats. She also received albuterol and atrovent nebs for wheezing
which raised her HR from 120s to 140s. She also had wide pulse
pressure with diastolic BPs in 30s and received 3 L NS w/o
significant increase in her BP.  However, she continued to
maintain systolic BPs above 100. Tmax was 100.1. She was found
to have leukocytosis to 20K w/ 12% bands. CXR was c/w RUL pna.
Because there was concern for a wedge shaped infarct on CXR a
CTA was performed which was negative. U/A was also negative. A
lactate was drawn which was 1.2. She was given 500 mg of po
azithromycin and 1 gram of IV ceftriaxone and was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient continued to have a wide pulse pressure
despite maintaining good systolic BPs and was tachycardic to the
140s-150s.  She was complaining of being thirsty but felt that
her chest pain and SOB had improved.  She was febrile to 102 and
received APAP.  She also received 500 cc NS bolus w/ improvement
in her tachycarida to 120s.

Brief Hospital Course:
20 yo female w/o significant PMHx p/w 2 days of productive
cough, fever, chills, SOB, and pleuritic chest pain, hypoxic and
tachycardic on admission, found to have multilobar pneumonia.
.
# Hypoxia:  Secondary to severe multilobar pneumonia seen on CXR
and CT chest.  No evidence of PE on CTA.  She was started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia
with improvement in her clinical status; O2 requirements
decreased from high flow O2 to NC, afebrile on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
and wbc count improving.  Blood cultures NGTD.  Eventually
transtioned to Cefpodoxime and PO Azithro with continued
improvement in her clinical course.  Will complete a total of a
10 day course.  Of note, sputum cultures and legionella Ab/Cx
negative, organism never identified.  ?Strep Pneumo given GPC in
pairs on initial sputum sample.
.
# ARF:  There was only one other creatinine in the [**Hospital1 18**] system
(0.9) whereas it was elevated to 1.5 on this admission.  Likely
in the setting of hypotension/poor perfusion and volume
depletion in setting of fever and poor PO intake.  Creatinine
resolved to 0.7 following fluid resuscitation.
