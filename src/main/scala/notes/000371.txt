Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 82M with CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF
who presented with dyspnea on exertion for 3 days duration in
the setting of medication non-compliance.  He was admitted to
the cardiac intensive care unit and showed significant
improvement with diuresis.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Patient's symptoms of dyspnea on
exertion, increased lower extremity edema and non compliance
with lasix suppported acute systolic CHF episode. CXR also
supported this with b/l pleural effusions and associated central
vascular congestion. Patient transferred from ED on venti mask.
There was less concern for pneumonia as no symptoms, fever or
elevated white count. Trigger of acute CHF was most likely med
non-compliance; there were no EKG changes to suggest ACS,
cardiac enzymes were never significantly elevated, and the
patient denied increase of salt in diet. Patient was on 60 mg po
BID lasix at home however was not taking it because of his
frustration with needing to urinate frequently while on the
medication.  Pt did well with diuresis and fluid restriction and
was transfered to the floor after a couple days in the ICU.  He
was discharged with an indwelling foley cath to help with his
urine output and medication non-compliance with a follow-up
appointment scheduled with urology.
.
# RHYTHM: Rate controlled atrial fibrillation. He was
supratherapeutic on his INR on admission therefore warfarin was
initially held.  His outpatient Metoprolol was continued at 25mg
qd.  He was discharged with instructions to follow up in
[**Hospital 2786**] clinic for titration of his warfarin dosing,
and to resume coumadin dose at 7mg on [**10-18**] and [**10-19**] and [**10-20**]
prior to [**Hospital 2786**] clinic visit.
.
# Coronaries: 3vd s/p CABG.  His aspirin, statin and beta
blocker were continued as an inpatient.  His lisinopril was held
given his acute renal failure.
.
# Acute renal failure: Hyaline casts on admission Ua were
concerning for poor perfusion. Creatinine elevated mildly from
baseline of 1.1, peaked at 1.5, then was downtrending prior to
admission with a discharge creatinine of 1.3.  Meds were renally
dosed, electrolytes repleted and Lisinopril held.   Would
recommend outpatient follow-up to ensure complete resolution of
his renal failure.
.
# HTN: his amlodipine was continued for hx of hypertension,
lisinopril held as noted previously.
.
# DM: treated with NPH and insulin sliding scale while inpatient
.
# Depression: his celexa and risperidone were continued in the
inpatient setting.
.
# Glaucoma: Brimonidine/Dorzolamide/Timolol were continued in
the inpatient setting.

The patient was full code, this was confirmed with [**Name (NI) **]
