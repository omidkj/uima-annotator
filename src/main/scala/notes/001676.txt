History of Present Illness:
85 year old woman admitted with a chief complaint of hypoxia.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**2175-12-27**] after 10 day
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] for left below the knee amputation. She
has a history of steroid use for oxygen dependent COPD. On
arrival at [**Hospital1 **], her O2 sat was 97% on 2L. She has had a
steadily increasing oxygen requirement since, progressing to the
point on the day of admission of being on BiPap 14/8 15L. When
her mask is removed for even a few seconds, she desaturates to
the low 70s. She has been evaluated for her hypoxia by various
coverage physicians over the weekend and was treated with
nebulizer treatments and lasix with little improvement. She also
had a CXR on [**12-28**] which showed a left lower lobe pneumonia for
which she is on ceftriaxone, flagyl, and vancomycin. On the day
of admission, she was tachypneic, more hypoxic, with decreased
responsiveness, and was sent in for evaluation. On exam in the
ED, she was noted to have decreased air movement with rhonchi
and faint wheezes which improved with nebulizer treatments. Her
CXR was not impressive. An EKG showed multifocal atrial
tachycardia and mild lateral ST depressions. She was initially
placed on Bipap in the ED; after nebulizer treatments, she
improved and was put back on nasal cannula. She then again got
worse in the ED, and an ABG was 7.25/94/66. The patient was thus
intubated in the ED for worsening respiratory failure and sent
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Discharge labs:

Imaging:

Admission CXR:
1. Worsening of right upper lobe opacity near the future, which
are somewhat linear. Although it could represent subsegmental
atelectasis, cannot rule out the presence of pneumonia.
2. Background emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis as well as
pulmonary artery hypertension.
3. Bilateral small pleural effusions are stable.

Admission CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
2. Right lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis; this likely
represents
pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
3. Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy, most prominent in the AP
window and precarinal distribution.
4. Severe fibrotic, bronchiectatic, and cystic changes
consistent with the known history of COPD. No pneumothorax as
was demonstrated on the prior CT.
5. Several smaller focal areas of consolidation bilaterally, the
most prominent of which in the left lower lobe, just superior
and anterior to the dominant area of consolidation. While these
may represent multifocal areas of infection or fibrotic change,
followup should be obtained to exclude malignancy.
6. Small left-sided pleural effusion.
7. Mild prominence of the central main pulmonary artery, likely
consistent with the given history of pulmonary arterial
hypertension.

Head CT [**2176-1-5**]: There is no evidence for hemorrhage. The
ventricles, sulci, and cisterns demonstrate no effacement. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter junction is preserved. There are multiple
hypodensities seen in the subcortical and deep white matter as
well as both thalami that are the sequelae of chronic small
arterial ischemia. There is a frothy fluid within both maxillary
sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and right mastoid air cells that may
indicate sinusitis. The osseous structures are unremarkable.

CXR [**2176-1-5**]: Very large left-sided pneumothorax with signs of
tension.

Chest CT [**2176-1-5**]:
FINDINGS: The large left hydropneumothorax, mostly air filled
was also shown on plain chest radiographs earlier today. Since
it shifts the mediastinum rightward and everts the left
hemidiaphragm, it may be causing hemodynamic tension as well.
The left lung is tethered to the chest cage by many pleural
adhesions.
Right lower lobe consolidation is improving and edema has
resolved. Emphysema is severe. A 6- cm bulla marginates the left
major fissure and smaller bullae are seen elsewhere . The
airways are patent up to the segmental bronchi. There is no
right pleural or any pericardial effusion.
Subcentimeter mediastinal nodes not meet CT size criteria for
lymphadenopathy. Extensive atherosclerotic coronary artery
calcifications are noted, along with substantial aortic valvular
calcification. There is no pericardial effusion.
In the upper abdomen, the imaged liver, spleen, adrenals, and
kidneys are unremarkable. A 24-mm gallstone is noted without
evidence of cholecystitis.
There are no suspicious bone findings.
ET tube and NG tube are in good position with the NG tube
terminating in the body of the stomach and the ET tube well
above the carina.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left hydropneumothorax could be under tension and
hemodynamically significant.
2. Severe emphysema including a 6 cm bulla along the left major
fissure.
3. Improving right lower lobe consolidation.
4. Decreasing pulmonary edema.

CXR [**2176-1-5**] pm: Compared with the examination obtained
approximately 6 1/2 hours earlier, a left chest tube has been
inserted, with its tip ending in the apex. The left pneumothorax
has markedly diminished and is now small, best seen at the left
lateral costophrenic angle. The mediastinum is now midline. The
endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position. A nasogastric
tube descends into the abdomen. There is a background of chronic
lung disease and emphysema. Scattered nonspecific opacities are
present bilaterally.

CXR [**2176-1-8**]: Left lung appears to be completely re-expanded. The
left apical pleural tube is relatively short intrathoracic and
the tip of the basal tube is not its entire course is
extrathoracic. Little if any left pleural effusion or pleural
air. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Heart size is normal,
although larger than it was prior to chest tube insertion. Tip
of the ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube
passes into the stomach and out of view. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was paged to
discuss these findings at the time of dictation.

CXR [**2176-2-5**]: One of the
