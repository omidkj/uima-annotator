Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  50% to 55%  >= 55%

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire
is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Normal
LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Low normal LVEF.
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Mildly dilated RV cavity.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta. Focal calcifications in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. No MS. The MR vena contracta is <0.3cm. Mild
(1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
3. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A pacing. Preserved
biventricular systolic function. MR is mild. Aortic contour is
normal post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted preoperatively for IV heparin. She was taken to
the operating room on [**2106-6-15**] where she underwent a CABG x 3.
She was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She was
extubated later that day and transferred to the floor on POD #1.
Beta blockade was titrated and she was gently diuresed toward
her preop weight. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed without
incident. Coumadin restarted for history of PE. She went into
rapid atrial fibrillation, beta blockade was increased and she
was started on amio. Target INR 2.0-3.0 for prior PE and atrial
fibrillation. [**Last Name (un) **] consult done for better glucose management.
She was ready for discharge to rehab on POD #9.
