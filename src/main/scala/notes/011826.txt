Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13891**]
Chief Complaint:
low back pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 year-old Female with a PMH significant for
hypertension, depression and anxiety, obesity, prior back injury
(12 years prior from MVA) who initially presented to the [**Hospital 39437**] ER on [**2167-9-24**] with worsening low back pain with radiation
to the left groin and distally below the knee; with some
potential left-sided lower extremity weakness. She was diagnosed
with left limb sciatica and received Percocet for pain control
and was discharged home.
.
The patient's pain continued to complain of pain with increased
activity. She returned to the ED on [**2167-9-27**] and was given
Demerol, Vistaril and Toradol which improved her pain and she
was again discharged home. She notes that with increasing doses
of Ibuprofen, Diazepam and Percocet, her pain was controlled.
There was also a brief course of Prednisone prescribed by her
PCP without symptomatic improvement. She had no recent fevers or
chills. She denies mechanism of injury or trauma. She has been
doing heavy lifting with heavy suitcases lately, which may be a
triggering event. She denies bladder or bowel incontinence or
other evidence of focal neurologic deficits. She has no history
of spinal surgeries or manipulations.
.
She again returned to [**Hospital3 26615**] on [**2167-10-1**] with intractable
low back pain without further neurologic concerns, but she was
noted to have a fever to 100.0F. Radiographs of her L-spine and
left hip revealed degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine
as well as a 2-cm calcified density over the proximal right 12th
rib and kidney whcih was concerning for a nephrolith. She was
admitted to Medicine with Orthopedic surgery consultation at
that point for further work-up. A CXR on [**2167-10-1**] demonstrated a
patchy opacity over the right base with mild pulmonary vascular
prominence. CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2167-10-2**] demonstrated
no intra-abdominal fluid collection or psoas abscess, diffuse
fatty infiltration of the liver and partial compression fracture
at T12 (age indeterminate). Orthopedic surgery recommended MR
imaging of the lumbar spine to evaluate for an epidural abscess
but she was unable to tolerate this procedure due to
claustrophobia. During her hospitalization she continued to
spike to 103.0F and received IV Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin. Blood cultures (from [**2167-10-1**]) speciated
Staphylococcus aureus from 2 bottles.
.
Laboratory data at [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital were notable for a WBC
15.1 (12.9 on repeat) with 88% neutrophilia and no bands.
Hematocrit was 33.4-36% and platelets were 170. Serum sodium was
134, glucose 149, creatinine 0.8. INR 1.4. LFTs: AST 42 and ALT
76 with lipase 30. T-bili 1.4 and direct bili 0.9. Urinalysis
([**10-1**]) notable for WBC [**2-11**], [**12-3**] RBCs, trace bacteria, moderate
blood and no leukocyte or nitrites.
.
The pateint reportedly developed some acute hypoxic respiratory
concerns with an ABG noting 7.42/37/96. She was continued on
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for a presumed pulmonary source
given the right opacification on her CXR. She required ICU
transfer at the OSH given an increasing oxygen requirement (on
6L NC prior to transfer), despite hemodynamic stability. She was
empirically anticoagulated with therapeutic Lovenox for presumed
pulmonary embolus, but CTA imaging was deferred. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
.
On arrival to the Medicine floor at [**Hospital1 18**] she was noted to be
hemodynamically stable but had evidence of acute hypoxemia with
an increasing oxygen requirement and labored breathing (ABG
7.46/41/52). She recieved 500 cc normal saline bolus, Lasix 20
mg IV x 1 without improvement and thus she was transferred to
the MICU on a non-rebreather with saturations in the 94-96%
range.

Imaging:
CXR [**2167-10-3**]
FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
and there are
bilateral pulmonary opacifications most consistent with
pulmonary edema.  In
the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would
have to be
considered.  Costophrenic angles are clear, and there is no
large pleural
effusion.

MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine [**2167-10-3**]
FINDINGS:  There is no malalignment or loss of vertebral body
height.  No
suspect marrow signal is seen.  There is no cord compression.
The cord is
normal in signal intensity and morphology. There is mild disc
bulge at L5-S1.
Schmorl's nodes are noted in the thoracic spine.  There is no
pathologic
enhancement. Bilateral pulmonary
