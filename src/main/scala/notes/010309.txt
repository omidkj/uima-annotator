Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Right subclavian line placement
Femoral line placement
Therapeutic hypothermia protocol
Needle decompression for pneumothorax
Bilateral chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
70 y/o with DM2, HTN, HLD, asthma, who presented from her [**Hospital1 1501**]
with cardiac arrest.  She was reported to be in respiratory
distress, and when receiving a nebulizer, went into PEA arrest.
EMS was called, CPR was initiated and epinephrine was given x2.
The pt was intubated in the field and an I/O line was placed.
She arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] with CPR in progress, however shortly upon
arrival had confirmed return of spontaneous circulation with SBP
was low ~60s.  She was started on norepinephrine and
phenylephrine and dopamine were added sequentially.  Initial
labratory tests showed a lactate of 10 and a venous pH of 6.95.
She received one ampule of sodium bicarb and 3L NS.  Bedside
cardiac ultrasound showed global hypokinesis, but no pericardial
effusion or right heart strain.  ECG showed sinus rhythm.  ET
tube placement was confirmed by laryngoscopy (was pulled back
out of right main stem bronchus).  She had a sterile right
subclavian line placed and an unsterile femoral arterial line
placed.  She was started on the artic sun cooling protocol.
.
She then became increasingly more difficult to ventilate, with
high peak pressures.  Manual bagging was attempted, but was also
difficult.  Needle decompression was then preformed on the right
with positive release of air.  Right chest tube then placed,
however, bagging was persistently difficult.  Needle
decompression on left was negative, but chest tube was placed on
the left anyway, with improvement in bagging.
.
Family is here and attending spoke with family.  Requested
aggressive care including pressor support, but no CPR/DNR.
.
Most recent set of vitals prior to transfer: afebrile, 110,
87/56 18 100% on AC 300/24/8/100% with peak pressures 31.  Plan
was to get CT-A on way up to MICU to r/o PE.

Blood culture [**11-14**]: Pending
Urine culture [**11-14**]: ENTEROCOCCUS SP..    10,000-100,000
ORGANISMS/ML..

TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function.

CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Bilateral chest tubes terminating in the medial lung bases.
No large pneumothorax.
3. Nonspecific patchy opacity in the right upper lobe, could
represent pulmonary contusion from chest compression and/or
insertion of chest tube, pneumonia or aspiration.

CT Head: Limited study. No acute intracranial pathologic
process. No intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
70F with DM2, HTN, HLD, and asthma, who presented from her [**Hospital1 1501**]
s/p PEA arrest.  Suspected that acute hypoxia, possibly
secondary to asthma exacerbation, had led to cardiac arrest.
The patient was intubated in the field, arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with CPR in progress, and shortly upon arrival was found to have
return of spontaneous circulation with SBP in the 60s.
Admission labs notable for lactate 10 and venous pH of 6.95.
She had a sterile right subclavian line placed and an unsterile
femoral arterial line placed.   She was bolused 3L NS, treated
with sodium bicarb, and started on norepinephrine,
phenylephrine, and dopamine for blood pressure support.  She was
started on the therapeutic hypothermic cooling protocol.  In
setting of patient becoming difficult to ventilate with high
peak pressures, she had right-sided needle compression with
positive release of air; right chest tube then placed.  Needle
decompression on left was negative for release of air; left
chest tube also placed.   Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed
global hypokinesis, but no pericardial effusion or right he
