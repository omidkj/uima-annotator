HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male with
a history of having been on Coumadin for several months prior
to admission.

He was seen in the Emergency Room one day prior to admission,
status post a fall, and was treated for right upper extremity
injuries and subsequently discharge home in stable condition
at that time with an INR of 1.3.

However, he returned on the [**2-12**] with a history of
reported decreased alertness as noted by family and was taken
urgently for a head CT scan which showed a large right
subdural hematoma.  A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained
at that time, and the patient was taken emergently to the
operating room for drainage of the subdural hematoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (His previous medical history is
reported to have included)
1.  Atrial fibrillation (for which he was on the Coumadin).
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  History of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
5.  History of hematochromatosis.
6.  History of renal stones.
7.  History of anemia.
8.  History of peptic ulcer disease.
9.  History of sleep apnea.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at the time of
admission were uncertain due to the patient's comatose
status.  His only known medication was the Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  Allergic history reaction was unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical
examination, the patient was nonresponsive to verbal or
painful stimuli.  He has positive corneas bilaterally, and
the right pupil was round at 6 mm.  Left pupil was round
and 3 mm but reactive to 2 mm.  There was no withdrawal of
the bilateral upper extremities to painful stimuli, and there
was sluggish withdrawal in the bilateral lower extremities
with painful stimuli.  Toes were bilateral upgoing.  Hoffmann
was negative bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
findings at the time of admission showed a PTT of 27.1, a PT
of 13.9, and an INR of 1.3.  A hematocrit of 27.1, white
blood cell count of 18.9, and a platelet count of 154.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A head CT at the time of admission
showed a large right-sided subdural hematoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken emergently to the operating
room for evacuation of the hematoma. Subsequent to this, the
patient was taken to the trauma Intensive Care Unit at
approximately 9:15 p.m. after drainage of the hematoma.

However, at 11:15 p.m., the patient was noted to have
bilateral fixed and dilated pupils.  A STAT CT scan of the
head was again performed which demonstrated reaccumulation of
a right-sided subdural, primarily over the high frontal
parietal convexity measuring approximately 25% of the
preoperative size of the subdural.

Notably, however, there was relatively satisfactory
evacuation of the low temporal clot, and there was still air
present in the subdural space from the earlier craniotomy
that evening.  There was also a new right temporal
intercerebral hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage.
There was also right-sided massive hemispheric brain swelling
with a 3-cm midline shift, a trapped contralateral ventricle,
and diffuse of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white differentiation consistent with
infarction or ischemic brain injury.

On examination at that time, the pupils were 8 mm and fixed.
There was trace corneas bilaterally and trace cough, but no
withdrawal or motor response in all four extremities to
noxious stimuli.  The INR remained 1.3.  He had been given 2
units of fresh frozen plasma.  The platelets were 85,000.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] had a long discussion with the patient's wife,
daughter, and extended family, as well as a conversation with
the daughter in [**Name (NI) 622**] who is reportedly an Intensive Care
Unit nurse.  The family understood the magnitude of the
situation and the gravity of the patient's condition.  Yet,
at that time, they elected to continue with full aggressive
therapy.

The patient's neurologic condition continued to deteriorate
to the point where the patient was completely unresponsive on
[**2150-2-14**], with no evidence of withdrawal of any
extremities to painful stimuli.  Pupils remained fixed and
dilated, and serial brain death examinations showed the
patient to have met all criteria for brain death, and the
family was so informed.  The family understood the magnitude
and gravity of the situation.  Therefore, the patient was
maintained on ventilatory support with an intermittent
mandatory ventilation of 4 and FIO2 was switched to room air.
Neo-Synephrine drops were slowly decreased, and the patient's
heart stopped beating, and he was declared deceased at 2220
on [**2150-3-18**].
