History of Present Illness:
61 yo man with a h/o IDDM type I, CAD s/p CABG in [**3-/2187**],
systolic CHF (EF 40-45%) who presented after being found down at
home.
.
Pt was recently admitted for hyperglycemia in the setting of S.
viridans bactermia and pneumonia.  He was discharged to rehab on
[**2187-4-18**] to complete a course of IV abx.  He returned home last
Wed in his USOH.  However, since Sunday, he has had increased
fatigue.  His FSG have been in the 400s for the past few days
despite decreased appetite and increase in his Lantus from 10
units to 12-14 units qhs. This AM, he felt unwell while
standing, so sat down on the ground.  He was found there by
workers delivering some equipment, and they called EMS.  Pt was
reported to be tachycardic to 170s by EMS although BP described
as stable.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: P 170s in irrregular narrow complex
tachycardia, SBP 60s-70s manually, satting 98-100 on 2L.  Pt
initially with altered mental status.  Only able to palpate
fem/abd pulses on exam.  PIV access (18g x 2) placed, and pt
given 2.5 L NS.  He remained tachy to 150s, and BPs declined to
a low of 58.  Preparations were made to do electrocardioversion,
but but pt self-converted to sinus tachycardia in the 110s with
improvement in his SBP to 70s-80s and clearing of mental status
to AAO x3.  He was started on levophed and given empiric
vanc/zosyn.  Labs notable for glucose >500, lactate 12, K 7.1
(no peaked T's) for which pt received bicarb, insulin 10 units,
and started on insulin gtt at 10units/h.  While attempting to
place CVL for pressors, pt reported his DNR/DNI status on
multiple coversations and refused line and intubation.  CT head
and C-spine were negative on prelim read for acute path.  On
transfer to MICU, FSG still >500 but lactate trending down to
6.7, K 6.7.  Pt initally made only 30cc but after 8 L NS, was
beginning to increase UOP with 90cc within the hour prior to
transfer.  On transfer, VS: Afeb, HR 115 (sinus tach), 107/51 on
0.15 mcg/kg levophed, RR 16, O2sat 100% on NRB (placed for
transport to rads).
.
On the floor, pt currently feels at baseline.  He denies any
polyuria or polydipsia and reports being asymptomatic from
hyperglycemia in the past.  He denies any fevers, chills, cough,
shortness of breath, diarrhea, or dysuria.

CT Head [**2187-5-8**]:
HISTORY: 59-year-old male with altered mental status, found
down.
COMPARISON: Concurrent CT cervical spine.
TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed from the foramen magnum to the
cranial
vertex without IV contrast.
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no fracture, hemorrhage,
edema, mass
effect, shift of midline structures, or evidence of major
vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and configuration for the patient's age. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and soft tissues appear
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No fracture, hemorrhage, or edema.
.
CT C-Spine ([**2187-5-8**])
HISTORY: 59-year-old male with altered mental status, found
down.
COMPARISON: None available in the [**Hospital1 18**] PACS.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT helical acquisition was performed from the skull
base to the cervicothoracic junction without IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformations were provided.
CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no fracture or
malalignment. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
There is a mild left convex
curvature of the cervical spine, which may be positional.
However, in the
lower cervical spine, most pronounced in C5-C6, there is
degenerative change, with loss of disc height, endplate
sclerosis, and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation. At
this level, there is narrowing of the canal (3:62, 401B:32).
There is a chronic fracture of the left first rib. The
visualized lung apices and soft tissues appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or malalignment.
.
CXR ([**2187-5-8**])
INDICATION: 59-year-old man found down with altered mental
status and
tachycardia. Study to evaluate for fracture or acute
cardiopulmonary process.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2187-4-17**].
CHEST, SINGLE PORTABLE: There is near-complete interval
resolution of a
moderate left pleural effusion since [**2187-4-17**], with
residual tiny
pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis on the left. The
aerated lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
hilar contours are normal.
Limited evaluation of
