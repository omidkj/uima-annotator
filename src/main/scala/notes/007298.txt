CAROTID SERIES ([**2138-7-11**]): Stable plaque in the right internal
carotid artery and bifurcation with less than 40% hemodynamic
effect. On the left side, progression of plaque reaching now a
level of 70-79% stenosis.
.
HIP ([**2138-7-12**]): Four spot views of the left hip in the operating
room is reviewed. Three surgical screws transfixing the left
proximal femur, which is near anatomic alignment.
.
CT HEAD ([**2138-7-13**]): No acute intracranial pathology.
.
CHEST ([**2138-7-13**]): Continued cardiomegaly. Left lower lobe
atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.
.
MRA BRAIN ([**2138-7-13**]):
1. Acute infarction in the region of the right middle cerebral
artery.
2. MRA angiography showing patent right middle cerebral artery
and other major branches of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
3. Chronic infarct in the region of left middle cerebral artery.
4. Possible aneurysm in the region of left middle cerebral
artery bifurcation vs patulous bifurcation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hip fracture: Pt was admitted s/p fall with left femur
fracture.  He underwent a  L ORIF on [**2138-7-12**]. He received
wound care and Physical Therapy throughout his hospitalization.
Staples were removed 12 days post-op.
.
2. Stroke: One day post-op, the patient was noted to be
non-verbal. An emergent Head CT was obtained and Neurology was
consulted. Although the non-contrast Head CT was negative, they
felt that the patient's acute change was due to a new CVA and
recommended an MRI. MRI showed new acute infarction in the
region of the right middle cerebral artery. There were no
indications for thrombolytics and the patient was managed
medically with anti-coagulation  with Lovenox + ASA with tight
glycemic control. His goal BP was 160-180 and this was later
decreased to BP goal of 140-150. Pt's aphasia began to improve
over several days, with significant improvement by discharge.
Prior to discharge, he was started on warfarin per the
recommendation of Neurology.  He will be followed by Neurology
as an outpatient.
.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient was noted to be hypoxic
(89% on 2L) on [**2138-7-13**] and he was started on Levofloxacin +
Flagyl. A CXR was consistent with possible aspiration. The
patient was noted to have no gag reflex, and given his
aspiration risk, an NGT was placed. On [**2138-7-18**], noted to have
increased respiratory rate and increased work of breathing. Due
to worsening respiratory status, decision was made to intubate
and transfer to MICU for additional monitoring. In MICU, a
central R IJ was placed and a subsequent CXR showed large right
pneumothorax. A chest tube was placed by CT surgery. The patient
had improved respiratory function and was extubated on [**2138-7-19**].
He was transferred out of the MICU on [**7-21**]. The chest tube was
removed on [**2138-7-23**]. Levofloxacin/Flagyl was continued to
complete a 14-day course in total.
.
4. Swallow difficulty: After his CVA, the patient was evaluated
by Speech and Swallow service, and found to be unsafe for PO
intake. Given aspiration risk, several attempts to place NGT at
bedside were unsuccessful. Required IR guided placement of NGT.
Started on tube feeds. After video swallow on [**2138-7-23**], pt was
advanced to pureed foods and nectar juice, given improved
swallow ability. The NG tube was discontinued and the patient
demonstrated an adequate ability to swallow his food with
supervision.
.
5. CAD/AF: The patient was admitted in atrial fibrillation,
which is his baseline. He was managed with rate control. On
[**2138-7-18**], he developed ST-segment elevations. His rate and blood
pressure were tightly controlled. Troponin was elevated, without
elevation of CK. Cardiology was consulted and felt the clinical
presentation was consistent with demand ischemia.
.
6. UTI: UA on [**2138-7-13**] was consistent with a UTI. He was treated
with Levofloxacin, which was also used to treat the
aforementioned aspiration pneumonia.
.
7. Urinary retention/Hematuria:  The patient's foley was
discontinued when he was transferred from the MICU to the floor,
but he had urinary retention, as demonstrated by bladder scan.
His foley was reinserted and several days later, he had the
acute onset of gross hematuria.  This was considered possibly
related to trauma.  His foley was flushed and no blood clots
were evident.  He will be discharged to the acute rehabiliation
facility with the foley, but it should be discontinued as soon
as the patient is able to void on his own.
