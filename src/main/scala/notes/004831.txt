History of Present Illness:
Adapted from Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1356**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27175**] admission note. Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a
68F with a PMH s/f COPD (frequent exacerbations), who presents
with one week of worsening [**Known lastname **] and shortness of breath. The
patient reports that she has a chronic [**Known lastname **], of seven months
duration since her valve surgery, which is usually a dry hacking
[**Known lastname **]. This [**Known lastname **], she states, has been evaluated at length
without clear etiology. Since Monday (~4 days ago), she has had
new onset, gradually worsening dyspnea, described as a feeling
that "I can't catch my breath", and a more productive [**Known lastname **]. She
states sputum is clear/black. ROS is notably positive for
congestion, wheezing, occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
and new three pillow orthopnea (over the past week). Her ROS is
notably negative for myalgias, sore throat, chest pain, LE
edema, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She does note improvement
in symptoms after nebulizers at home and felt her [**Known lastname **] improved
after antibiotics were started. She has had sick contacts in her
grandchildren, but thinks that they did not have the flu (they
were all vaccinated for both seasonal and H1N1). Her PCP started
her on moxifloxacin on Wednesday (yesterday)for "bronchitis".
.
Review of systems is otherwise negative.
.
In the emergency department presenting vital signs were T=101.2,
BP=153/71, HR=134, RR=31, O2sat=83%RA. On exam, the ED resident
reports that she had diffuse wheezes. She was treated with
albuterol/ipatropium nebs, 125mg IV solumedrol, and
levofloxacin. Her O2 sats improved to 100% on 2L and she
appeared more comfortable. Labs were notable for a creatinine of
1.6 (baseline 0.9), and a leukocytosis of 16.6. Urine and blood
cultures were not sent. A CXR showed no consolidation, though
the film was of poor quality.
.
On the floor this AM, patient is comfortable and feels her
shortness of breath is much better. She would like to go home
today.

Studies:
CXR ([**12-13**]):
One view. Comparison with [**2181-12-15**]. Patchy increased density in
the right
upper lobe is unchanged. Streaky density at the lung bases is
stable. The
lungs are otherwise clear and unchanged. The heart and
mediastinal structures
are stable in appearance as well.

([**12-15**]) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe, possibly
somewhat
worse than on the earlier study. Streaky density at the lung
bases consistent
with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Evidence for COPD.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 68F with a PMH s/f COPD with frequent
exacerbations who presents with four days of worsening dyspnea,
and productive [**Known lastname **]. Now noted to be febrile, hypoxic, and
tachypneic.
.
#. Respiratory distress: On admission CXR pa/lat was performed
and identified a right upper lobe infiltrate concerning for
infection. Pt started on levofloxacin daily, nebulizers, and
prednisone taper. On patient's second day of admission she
spiked a fever and developed respiratory distress. She was
transfered to the ICU. In the ICU antibiotics were changed to
Vanc/Ceftaz/Azithromycin. She improved overnight and returned to
the floor without intubation. She was continued on
Vanc/Ceftaz/Azithromycin and steroid taper. Her breathing slowly
improved. Sputum cultures revealed pseudomonas. PICC line was
placed and antibiotics were changed to Vanc/Cefepime and patient
was discharged to complete a two week course of antibiotics. She
will also complete a rapid prednisone taper. She will follow up
with her PCP and have [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest xray repeated at 6 weeks.
.
#. Acute kidney injury- Likely related to decreased volume
status. Given 1 liter NS in ED and creatinine decreased to 1.5.
Unclear baseline however patient has had creatinine of 0.9 in
[**Month (only) **]. FE Urea 27% pointing toward pre renal etiology. At
discharge creatinine was 1.2 on 80mg daily lasix. Of note,
during hospitalization did not require potassium
supplementation, so this was held on discharge. PCP should check
level next week and determine if this may be needed in the
future.
.
#. H/o Atrial fibrillation: Continued on metoprolol and
diltiazem
.
#. Hyperlipidemia- continued on simvastatin
.
#. Hyperthyroid (toxic multinodular goiter- continued
methimazole
.
#  Hyperglycemia: While on steroids patient developed
significant hyperglycemia which reguired sliding scale insulin.
She was discharge with insulin sliding scale which should be
continued until rapid steroid taper is complete. She should
follow up with PCP in one week to determine if insulin is
required.
