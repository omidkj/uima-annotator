Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD Firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 25268**] is a 74 year old genetleman with history of CAD s/p
CABG, MI, ICD placement atrial fibrillation on coumadin whop
resented today after a firing of his ICD. He was in his USOH
taking a shower today when the ICD suddenly fired. He denied any
symptoms of light headedness, chest pain, or palpitations prior.
He called his wife who sat him down and shortly afterwards EMS
arrived. He never lost consciousness. He was taken to an OSH
where he developed mild respiratory distress resolved with 2L
O2,CXR showed mild CHF. EKG showed NSR @ 92 with LVH and ST
changes consistent with inferolateral ischemia. CPK 162, CKMB
26, CI 16, BNP 18,295, Trop 0.68. He was referred for a cath.
.
He had a similar episode in [**2164**] where device fired due to
atrial fibrillation. The ICD was reprogrammed afterwards and he
has not had any ICD firings until today.
.
Of note he was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 112**] from [**2172-2-1**] to [**2172-2-8**] for
urosepsis secondary to obstructive nepholithiasis s/p L
percutaneous neprhostomy tube and L utereral stent placement,
multifocal pneumonia, afib with RVR and NSTEMI. On arrival, he
was started on pressors and intubated. He was treated with
ceftriaxone for pansensitive Ecoli fromt he urine and also for
CAP. He developed afib with RVR conrolled on amiodarone. On
[**2172-2-2**] he was extubated, folliwing he developed AMS and flash
pulmonary edema which resolved with BiPAP and diuresis. He also
had an NSTEMI not heparinized given supratherapeutic INR. TTE
showed global hypokinesis with EF of 45%. On [**2-4**], he returned
to IR for replacement of nephrostomy tube, went into PEA arrest
in the setting of induction. Puse returned and he was medically
managed with pressors. On [**2-6**] he was taken tot he OR for
placement of a left ureteral stent, left nephrostomy tube was
removed. He was extubated again on [**2-6**].
.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and
inferolateral akinesis. The basal to mid lateral wall and distal
inferior wall are moderately hypokinetic. Doppler parameters are
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe focal LV hypokinesis, consistent with prior
inferior/inferolateral infarction. Hypertrophied, dilated and
depressed right ventricle with moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. At least mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG, recurrent MI in
[**2165**], VT with ICD, PAF with inappropriate ICD response, who
presents with inappropriate ICD firing after prolonged
hospitalization for urosepsis and respiratory distress.
.
# Afib with RVR: Patient was previously on nadolol 80mg which
was recently changed to metoprolol 25mg daily. This reduction in
dose was likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of
sepsis. He subsequently had 2 episodes of Afib with RVR
requiring IV lopressor and dilt. His standing dose was then
increased to 25mg PO TID.  He was started on amiodarone 200 mg
TID and discharged on metorpolol succinate 50 once a day.  INR
remained therapeutic throughout admission.
.
# CHF: Patient extremely volume overloaded on admission.  Echo
showing EF 25-30%. It appears that he has had some depression of
his cardiac function since his prior outpatient ECHO. this may
be secondary to NSTEMI associated with PEA arrest. It may also
be a critical illness myopathy that would take time to resolve.
He was diuresed throughout his admissions several liters and
eventually discharged on lasix 40 once a day.
.
# Elevated troponin - likely secondary to ischemic injury caused
by defibrillator firing. MB trended down.  He was continued on
home. ASA, BB, Statin
