Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
Decreased responsiveness; found to have ICH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 77-year-old woman with a history of HTN,
hyperlipidemia, and dementia who presented with decreased
responsiveness after a fall and was found to have a large L
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She reportedly was
attempting to take a step up her stairs, but was unable to do
so, fell and hit her head. She was taken to an OSH where a CT
revealed a large ICH as above. At presentation, she had a GCS of
7. She was intubated due to an inability to protect her airway
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]; she received 50 mg of Fentanyl, 40 of
propofol, and Versed.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, a her initial vitals were stable as below. A
repeat head CT showed evolution of the bleed compared to that
from the OSH, with increased edema and slightly increased
midline shift.

Pertinent Results:
Laboratory Data on Admission:
140  110  13  111
5.1  22  0.6
Comments: moderately hemolyzed
Ca: 7.6 Mg: 2.1 P: 2.7
PT: 12.9  PTT: 33.3  INR: 1.1
WBC: 16.4; Hct 31.9; Plt 282
U/A negative.

EKG at OSH: NSR at 60, nl intervals, nl axis, no ST-T changes.

Radiologic Data:
NCHCT [**7-4**]: 1.  Large left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with a fluid-fluid level. This may suggest hyperacute and acute
bleeding, possibly into an underlying cavity.  An MRI of the
brain with gadolinium may be of value in excluding an underlying
abnormality, such as vascular malformation or tumor.  The
hemorrhage is not typical of that resulting from trauma.
2.  There has been slight increase in the rightward subfalcine
herniation, now 8 mm.  No downward transtentorial herniation
noted.
3.  Stable right frontal subgaleal hematoma.

CXR [**7-4**]:  Consistent with the given history, an endotracheal
tube has been advanced with the distal tip approximately 2.5 cm
from the carina.  A nasogastric tube has also been placed with
the side hole well beyond the gastroesophageal junction in good
position.  The lungs are hyperexpanded but clear.  There is a
tortuous atherosclerotic aorta.  The cardiac silhouette is
borderline enlarged.  No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.

NCHCT [**7-5**] AM: No significant interval change in size or
characteristics of large left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma,
but evidence of increased mass effect, with new obscuration of
right cortical sulci, and increased dilatation of the temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.

NCHCT [**7-5**] PM: Since [**2198-7-4**], no significant change in size of
large left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma with a hematocrit
level but with minimal worsening of the left to right subfalcine
herniation and increase in size of the trigone and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
of the right lateral ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19940**] was a 77-year-old woman with h/o dementia, HTN, and
hyperlipidemia who presented with decreased responsiveness due
to large L frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Her brief
hospital course by problem is as follows:

1. Neuro: Intracranial Hemorrhage (L frontal intraparenchymal).
Her ICH score was 2 (1 for GCS 7 on presentation to OSH, 1 for
volume > 30 cc; 0 for age, 0 for supratentorial location; 0 for
no intraventicular). This gave her roughly a 25-30% 30-day
mortality on presentation. This was discussed with the family,
who felt that was sufficient to warrant treatment. She therefore
remained intubated (having been intubated in the ED). The
differential for the etiology included amyloid, HTN, AVM, occult
tumor, and (less likely) hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic
stroke; it was ultimately felt that amyloid was most likely,
though it was certainly not classic. She was admitted to the
Neuro ICU for close monitoring. Her BP was carefully followed to
keep MAP < 130. She was started on Mannitol. However, she
continued to decline, with upper motor neuron signs developing
on the left in addition to the right (e.g. triple flexion,
extensor toes). Repeat CT scans also showed increasing edema. In
discussion with the family, she was made CMO on the second day
of her hospitalization. She was extubated, all medications
stopped except a morphine drip, and she was transferred to the
floor, where she passed away one day later.
