Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from an outside hospital with two days
of nausea/vomiting and a plain film concerning for bowel
obstruction. Her CT at admission demosntrated a high grade SBO
with transistion point, and mesenteric venous gas highly
concerning for ischemia. In the setting of this imaging and her
clinical presentation, she was taken emergently to the operating
room for exploratory laparotomy. At the time of operation, she
had diffuse abdominal adhesions with adjacent loops of small
bowel.  There were multiple loops of small bowel particularly in
the pelvis adjacent to the sigmoid colon and cecum that were
densely adherent. No areas of ischemia or compromised blood flow
were identified. She underwent extensive lysis of adhesions. For
full details please see the dictated operative note.

Neuro: she was taken postoperatively to the ICU intubated and
sedated. After waking up from anesthesia she remained awake and
alert. Pain was controlled with intermittent IV dilaudid. As she
recovered and began to tolerate PO she was transitioned to PO
dilaudid, which was slowly weaned down over the course of her
hospitalization. She also was restarted on home medications
gabapentin and tramadol.

CV: Postoperatively she had a transient pressor requirement;
these were weaned on POD 2. She remained hemodynamically stable
for the duration of her hospital course.

Pulm: She was intubated post-operatively. She successfully
extubated on POD2 and oxygen was subsequently weaned off. She
was stable on room air for the remainder of her hospitalization
with no pulmonary issues.

GI: On POD 2 a PICC line was placed to initiate TPN. After
extubation she was advanced to small sips of liquids which she
tolerated; after bowel function returned she was advanced to
clears and then regular diet. She was continued on TPN until PO
intake was adequate and then TPN was weaned off; at time of
discharge she is tolerating a regular diet.

At time of operation, 1L of ascites was evacuated from the
abdomen. The ascites reaccumulated and her abdomen became
markedly distended; an ultrasound on POD5 confirmed ascites and
she underwent US-guided paracentesis for 7L of fluid which was
sent for cell count and differential; 1100 WBC with 72% PMNs.
She was started on ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis. She required
repeat paracentesis for 4L of fluid on POD 9 with 300 WBC 39%
PMNs. Final paracentesis on [**10-31**], at this time doppler
ultrasound of portal vein was performed showing patency. 4L
removed.

GU: After transfer from the ICU to the floor her foley was
removed and she voided without issues. She was restarted on her
home diuretics (aldactone 100' and lasix 80'') slowly; initially
lasix 20' and aldactone 100', when she tolerated this with
stable creatinine lasix was increased to 20'' and aldactone to
150'. At this point her creatinine increased from 0.7->1.6; all
diuretics were held and her creatinine recovered. Urine output
stayed stable. She was restarted prior to discharge on aldactone
100 daily and lasix 20 daily; she will be discharged on these
doses and diuretics should be further titrated outpatient. She
will also have outpatient lab work after discharge to monitor
renal function and electrolytes.

ID: She was initially started on vanc/zosyn; after the operation
she was transitioned to unasyn. After paracentesis demonstrating
1100 WBC with predominance of polys, she was started on
ceftriaxone for the duration of her hospitalization. She is
discharged on one week of Cipro [**Hospital1 **]; after this she will stay on
daily cipro prophylaxis.

At time of discharge, pain is well controlled on minimal PO pain
medication and her home regimen. She is tolerating a regular
diet, voiding without issues, and ambulating unaided. Staples
were removed prior to discharge and steri-strips put in place;
the incision is clean dry and intact. She has follow up
appointments arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12885**] in hepatology and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. This plan has been discussed with the patient who
expresses understanding and agreement.
