Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
55 YO M with metastatic colon CA p/w PE and brain mass

# Brain Mass- He was found to have a new brain lesion on MRI
after presenting to the ED with a left retroorbital headache.
He was started on decadron and was neurooncology, radiation
oncology, and neurosurgery were consulted. There was concern for
leptomeningeal disease, and a lumbar puncture was performed to
evaluate for leptomeningeal disease, which was noted to have a
high opening pressure of 27, but without positive cytology or
suggestive chemistries.  Therefore, he was subsequently
evaluated by neurosurgery and brain tumor resection was
performed.
Pt was taken to the OR [**6-19**] electiveley where under general
anesthesia he underwent right occipital craniotomy with excision
of metastatic lesion. He tolerated this well and was transferred
to the PACU overnight for close neurologic monitoring.  He
remained stable and was transferred to the floor. Diet and
activity were advanced without difficulty.  Wound was clean ,
dry and intact. He was transferred back to Omed [**6-21**].  He was
also started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis after his
surgery was performed.  He was never noted to have seizures
during his hospital course, continuation of Dilantin and/or
level monitoring was to be performed at a follow up appointment
with neurooncology. The pathology indicated likely colonic
adenocarcinoma.  His headached were well controlled on
decadrone, and he was continued on his dilantin, to follow up in
[**Hospital 20891**] clinic for monitoring.  His treatment plan was to
include radiation therapy, he was discharged with follow up with
[**Hospital1 18**] radiation treatment.

# PE- He was noted to have a  small 1 vessel, segmental thrombus
noted on CT thorax.  This was confirmed on a dedicated CTA of
chest, he had negative LENIs and was clinically asymptomatic
without no ekg changes. A IVC filter was placed for prophylaxis.
 As his left porta cath had no drawback, and on history was
noted to have neck pain a few weeks prior, his left upper
extremity was dopplered and demonstrated an upper extremity
clot.  He was not systemically anticoagulated, and this was to
be discussed at a future oncological appointment, as the risk of
bleed was thought greater than that of a PE.

# Colon CA-s/p resection, adjuvant chemo FOLFOX+avastin . He was
found to have a brain metastasis on this admission.  His
headache was well controlled with steroids and narcotics, and
nausea controlled with antiemetics. Further chemotherapy was to
be discussed as an outpatient.

# CV- HTN - Stable continued on lisinopril, HCTZ, and aspirin
was held.

# Depression- He became more depressed during his hospital
course, and his fluoxetine was increased during his hospital
course.

# Seasonal allergies: Held  claritin
