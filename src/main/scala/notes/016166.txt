History of Present Illness:
64F with past medical history of nodular regenerative
hyperplasia resulting in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension
complicated by ascites/volume overload in addition to grade II
esophageal varices, depressed EF (50-55%), ITP,
hypogammaglobulinemia on monthly IVIG, Colon cancer s/p
resection [**4-/2190**] and 6 cycles of FOLFOX, hypertension, DM1 with
retinopathy, recurrent bronchitis with bronchiectasis,
splenectomy [**5-17**] complicated by shock liver and acute renal
failure that developed shortness of breath and cough several
days ago.

She was seen at [**Location (un) 2274**] on [**8-1**] with low grade fevers and
complained of shortness of breath. A CXR showed ? CHF.  Her home
lasix dosage was increased (lasix 40 mg PO BID to TID) with
addition of metazoline but today she had increased productive
cough with shortness of breath and labored brathing. She was
advised to go to ER.  Patient feels that her legs are more
swollen than usual.

In the ED, initial VS were: Triage   10:53 0 68 30 58% ra

Patient was triggered on arrival for O2 sats in 50-70s at
triage.

Patient had hypertension to 180s and was given nitroglycerin and
started on nitroglycerin infusion in addition to biPAP. Foley
was placed with 150 cc urine output.

Patient received nitroglycerin 0.14 mcg/kg/min infusion in
addition to furosemide 80 mg IV, vancomycin 1000 mg IV, and
cefepime 2 gm IV.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient was taken off biPAP. Patient
was in mild-moderate respiratory distress but able to say [**4-12**]
word sentences although pOX 84-90 on face tent on 15L.

[**2191-8-5**]
echocardiogram
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is a bidirectional shunt across the interatrial
septum at rest (minimal color left to right, saline contrast
right to left). Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-4-15**],
the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has probably
increased. A small ASD with mild bidirectional shunting is now
appreciated. Cardiac systolic function and the pericardial
effusion are similar

CT Chest [**2191-8-6**]
1.  Progression of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and significant
worsening of diffuse bilateral airspace disease consisting of
ground-glass opacities and patchy and confluent consolidations
on a background of diffuse interlobular septal thickening.
Findings are nonspecific and can be seen with pulmonary edema,
hemorrhage and/or infectious process.
2.  Increased size of bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal
ascites.
3.  Stable cardiomegaly and coronary artery disease.  Stable
small pericardial effusion.
4.  Redemonstration of bilateral lower lobe interstitial
opacities and
bronchiectasis suggestive of chronic underlying interstitial
pneumonia versus scarring.
5.  Enlarged pulmonary trunk, likely related to pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.
6.  Interval splenectomy.

[**2191-8-7**] cytology bronchial washings NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**2191-8-7**] US No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right
upper extremity.

[**2191-8-12**] CT Head No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute
infarction.

[**2191-8-15**] EEG
This is an abnormal waking EEG because of slow background mostly

in the theta but some intermixed delta activity. There are
frequent bursts of frontally predominant but generalized
polymorphic delta activity. These
findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse
encephalopathy with
possible accentuation of midline structures and may be
representing a
metabolic dysfunction related to the respiratory condition.

[**2191-8-18**] CXR
Compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter has
been
advanced.  Tip of the catheter now projects over the distal
parts of the
stomach.  No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.


The other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
position.  Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma, with
bilateral diffuse parenchymal
opacities, right slightly more than left.  Unchanged appearance
of the
moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette.  No larger pleural
effusions.
