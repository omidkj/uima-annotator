Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5438**]
Chief Complaint:
tx from [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for resp failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
51 yo m with h/o IPF was in USOH at home until 7 days PTA when
he developed inc brown sptum, SOB, and chills. Developed
diarrhea 3 days PTA. last few days SOB got worse. During the
last few days, his pulm increased steroids ans stated on a
Zpack. Over the next day, had decreased eating and inc weakness.
He is normally on 1.5 L NC O2 at home since his DC from [**1-26**].
Wife called EMS at midnight of [**4-27**]. who brought him to [**Hospital 1281**]
Hosp ED. EMS was unable to obtain an O2 sat and placed him on
NRB. On presentation to the ED, his O2 sat was 55% on arrival
and then 79% on NRB. ABG pn NRB was 7.44/27/72. He was given
tylenol, ativen, rochephin, solumedrol 125 IV, Bactrim, flagyl,
and azithro in the ED. Was intubated in the ICU at [**Hospital1 1281**] at
0245. While intubated, becamse hypotensive and was started on
neo and given fluids. Was switched to levophed and vasopression
in the ICU. BP reported at 60's systolic. Under sterile
conditions, placed L IJ and L art groin line [**2-21**] him being
clamped down. Gave aggressive IVF (4L). CVP went from 10 -> 30
with fluids. ABG after intubation 7.05/40/86 on AC
500/30/10/100. He was noted to have WBC of 29 with 8% bands and
given ceftax, vanc, flagyl (?cdiff) in the ICU. Also wanted to
give bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] did not get b/f transfer. Got a DFA
for flu which is neg. Also noted to be in ARF with Cr 2.1. Also

.
Transfered via [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**]. On route, required vecuronium
an fentanyl bolus. Stopped propofol for hypotension. On
presentation to the ICU, gas was 6.98/66/84 on AC 500/18/13/100.
Was on levophed and vasopression and bicarb gtt.

Past Medical History:
1. NIDDM
2. HTN
3. Intersitial pulm fibrosis - Starting in [**9-25**], the patietn
started to have some SOB. Admitted to OSH [**12-25**] and CT showed
pulm infilatrates and honeycoming. VATs-bx at [**Hospital 1281**] hosp showed
diffuse aveolar damage. Felt to have rapidly accerleating IPF.
That admission was started on steroids and went into rehab. DC
from rehab in [**1-26**] on 1.5 L home O2. on a VERY slow pred taper.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 51 yo m with h/o IPF dx at [**Hospital 1281**] hospital in [**12-25**]
here with septic shock and acute resp failure who expired
shortly after presentation to the hospital given profound shock.

.
# Resp failure: Most likley [**2-21**] to acceleration of IPF. Was on
steroids with a long taper and no PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] that can be
ascertained from records we have. Therefore, at increased risk
for pathogens such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], [**Name11 (NameIs) **], Aspergillus,
coccidioidomycosis, and nocardia, given his immunocompromised
state. Diagnostics:
sputum cultures, viral screen, U leg antigen. Considered bronch
but unable to decrease FiO2. Family was to bring the path slides
and CT scans from [**Hospital1 1281**] hosptial pathology and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
will review them to give second opnion on diagnosis of IPF.
Theraputics: continued abx which included cefepime for gram pos
and pseudomonas coverage; azithro for leginella and mycoplasma
coverage; Vanc by level for MRSA (no history of MRSA); bactrim
for PCP and nocardia. Ventilation and oxygenation: esopheal
balloon to measure trans plumonary pressures. Pt with high chest
wall compliance, but very low lung compliance. Continued on PCV
to limit peak pressures, need to limit PEEP as well. was
initially having very low sats on 100% Fio2 and 13 PEEP.
Attempted to wean FiO2.
.
# Septic Shock: Most concerning for pulmonary etiology. Pan
culture and f/u OSH cultures. Broad spectrum abx. Stress dose
steroids. Attempted to keep CVP > 20 given high PEEP. Monitored
UO which slowly decreased to anuria at time of demise.
Continued levophed and vasopressin.
.
# Gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis: was on bicarb
gtt for most of the day. Elevated lactate, which continued to
trend up until the patients demise.
.
# DM: insulin gtt
.
# ARF: Cr 2.1 on presentation. No h/o renal failure. could be
related to sepsis, volume depletion. Fluid repletion, but
patient with lactic acidosis, renal failure, anuric at time of
demise.
.
# Coagulopathy: Concerning for DIC. D-dimer high and INR
increasing. PE lower on differential since has clear infectious
signs and labs. Avoided heparin.
.
# Diarrhea, has a h/o ciff in the past and has had 3 days
diarrhea since starting zpack. Flagyl emperically. c-diff toxin
was to be checked x3
.
# HTN: Held HCTZ while in shock
# Hyperchol: Held statin while has shock liver
# FEN: NPO, bolus for low UO
.
# Communication/Code: had family discussion on [**4-27**] about
expectations. Told family that his IPF is a terminal disease and
that his chance of making it though this illness is very low.
The family was unaware of the severity of the diagnosis and its
natural progression for unclear reasons. The patient did not
share much of his medical history with the family. Of note, he
told his wife that he did not want to go to the hospital though
he had been very ill for the last few days. The outcome of the
meeting was to
