Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12163**] is an 86 yo man with extensive hx of CAD as well as
severe AS, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] this morning after
having chest pain overnight. PMH signficant for diabetes,
dyslipidemia, hypertension, with CABG in [**2104**], RCA stent X2 in
[**2105**] and OM stent in [**2110**] with most recent cath in [**2116-5-5**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 12163**] has chest pain at least once weekly, which usually
resolves with one Nitro. Last night developed CP while in bed,
took Nitro x3, pain resolved each time but when pain came back
the fourth time he became concerned and drove with wife to
[**Name (NI) 620**] [**Name (NI) **]. The CP was the same in character to his usual CP,
with some radiation to jaw, no radiation to back. No SOB, no
diaphoresis.
.
At baseline, patient lives with wife, can walk around and climb
stairs without chest pain.
.
Arrived in [**Location (un) 620**] ED with chest pain and EKG at 330 showed
sinus rhythm with rate of 130, left axis deviation, LAFB with
RBBB, ST depressions in V3-V5.  No ST elevations were noted.
Vitals were HR 98 BP 176/110 and Sat 99% RA. Patient was given
bolus of heparin with heparin gtt start; started on Nitro gtt
and Integrilin gtt. Patient became CP free and EKG showed
improvement in ST depressions in V4-V5 with continue depression
V3. First set of enzymes at OSH were negative. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] CCU patient was pain free.

EKG [**2116-9-13**]: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left axis
deviation with left anterior fascicular block. Right
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-5-22**]
there is no significant diagnostic change.

Echocardiogram [**2116-9-14**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with only the
lateral wall having relatively normal function. There is an
anteroapical left ventricular aneurysm. A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-7-19**],
there are more extensive wall motion abnormalities (suggestive
of interim LAD ischemia/infarction). The velocities across the
aortic valve are similar. The degree of aortic stenosis may be
underestimated on the current study (low output - low gradient
aortic stenosis).

Cardiac Catherization [**2116-9-15**]:
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated
three
vessel disease. The LMCA was diffusely diseased with 80-95%
stenosis.
The LAD was occluded proximally. The distal LAD filled via the
LIMA and
was a small, 1.5mm vessel with diffuse disease and a 60-70%
apical
stenosis that was unchanged from the catheterization of 6/[**2115**].
The LCx
was diffusely diseased. OM1 and OM2 were very small vessels with
serial
60-80% stenoses.  The RCA had mild luminal irregularities with
serial
calcific 30-40% stenoses. There was a diffusely diseased PDA
branch
with 80% stenosis unchanged from prior.
Arterial conduit arteriography demonstrated a widely patent
LIMA-LAD.
The SVG-OM was known to be occluded and was not engaged.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated
left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP 32mmHg. The systemic
arterial
blood pressure was normal with SBP 107mmHg and DBP 52mmHg.
There was minimal gradient across aortic valve (peak to peak 20
mm Hg).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease, essentially unchanged
from [**5-14**].
2. Markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures

CXR [**2116-9-19**]
A right subclavian PICC line is present. The tip is not
optimally visualized, but likely overlies the distal SVC near
the RA junction. Possible minimal change in position compared
with the film from [**2116-9-16**]. No pneumothorax is detected.
Background COPD is noted. There are bibasilar opacities, similar
to [**2116-9-16**], though the degree of opacity in the left
cardiophrenic region is greater on today's exam. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are present. No CHF. Otherwise, no new
infiltrate. No pneumothorax detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12163**] is an 86yo male with HTN, DM, HLD and extensive
history of CAD s/p CABG as well as severe AS, who was admitted
to the CCU with the diagnosis of

NSTEMI: No EKG changes suggestive of ST-elevation on admission;
CK peaked at 566 and CKMB peaked at 64. He was medically managed
for his NSTEMI with a heparin drip, metoprolol, lisinopril,
crestor, plavix, and full dose ASA. On [**2116-9-14**] an
echocardiogram showed an interval decrease in his EF from [**2113**]
of 50% to 25-30%.  The echocardiogram also demonstrated a new
left ventricular aneurysm. In the setting of the new
hypokinesis, the patient also intermittently complained of
chest/jaw pain and anginal symptoms responsive to SL nitro with
reversible new ischemic changes in the lateral leads. This
prompted investigation of whether the LIMA to LAD graft from his
bypass was still patent as it was in 6/[**2115**]. The catherization
