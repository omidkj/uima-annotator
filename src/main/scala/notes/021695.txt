[**Last Name (un) 2902**], prednisone-induced diabetes mellitus, and colon
cancer (status post resections) admitted from the
when he arrived for a follow-up colonoscopy.

He was given intravenous cefazolin in the Gastroenterology
unit.  The daughter states she is concerned that he is not
taking proper care of himself or eating well and feels that
he may need home services.  The patient states he noted the
cellulitis for about one week, and it just got worse today.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission weight
was 228.6 pounds.  His height is 5 feet 6 inches.  Vital
signs revealed temperature was 99.2, heart rate was 114,
blood pressure was 106/71, blood sugar was 107, oxygen
saturation was 96% on 3 liters.  He was sitting up on a
gurney, pleasant, in no apparent distress.  He had bilateral
proptosis.  His tracheostomy site was clean, dry, and intact.
Extraocular muscles were intact.  He was tachycardic without
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  He was diffusely rhonchorous with
no wheezes noted.  He had normal active bowel sounds.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, but obese.
Lower extremity edema bilaterally; 1 to 2+ pitting edema,
right greater than left.  The left lower extremity was with
erythema and warmth extending up inner thigh on knee with one
small ulceration on the medial aspect above the ankle on the
left that was weeping, surrounded by an entire area of edema
and blistering.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 8.8, hematocrit was 38.8,
platelets were 137, and mean cell volume was 94.  Blood
cultures and chest x-ray were pending at this time.
Differential on the complete blood count with neutrophils
82%, bands 2% and lymphocytes 8%.  Chemistry-7 revealed
sodium was 139, potassium was 7.2, chloride was 94,
bicarbonate was 39, blood urea nitrogen was 29, creatinine
was 1.2, and blood glucose was 111.  This specimen was
grossly hemolyzed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 75-year-old gentleman with a
past medical history significant for colon cancer who arrived
to [**Hospital1 69**] for a follow-up
colonoscopy; at which time he was found to have a severe
cellulitis.  He was admitted for intravenous antibiotic
therapy.

He was continued on intravenous cefazolin 1 g q.8h.  Blood
cultures and urine cultures were sent, his fever curve as
well as white blood cell count were monitored.

For his myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], he was continued on his prednisone
as well as azathioprine.  In light of his prednisone-induced
diabetes mellitus, he was continued on q.i.d. fingersticks,
and his Amaryl as well as a regular insulin sliding-scale.

He was continued on his 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and
encouraged to use his BiPAP at night.  In light of the recent
colonoscopy preparation, he was fluid resuscitated with 2
liters of normal saline.

The patient continued to do well on the intravenous
cefazolin.  He remained afebrile.  Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy consultations were requested to evaluate
for services at home.

During his hospital stay, he was noted to have increased
trouble breathing, and had increased secretions, and felt
like his tracheostomy was plugging.  A sputum culture and
Gram stain were sent to evaluate.  A chest x-ray was obtained
and showed bibasilar opacities described as either
atelectasis or pneumonia.  His white blood cell count
continued to remain down, and he was afebrile; although, he
was still with significant erythema and discomfort of his
left lower extremity.

In light of his low white blood cell count and
immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and azathioprine,
he was started on Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis
of Bactrim double strength three times per week.

The patient also expressed his concern during his stay about
repeating his colonoscopy that he was scheduled for.  In
discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was determined to reschedule
this as an outpatient when his acute issues were resolved.

He was continued with intravenous hydration due to a
persistent tachycardia thought secondary to the aggressive
colonoscopy preparation the patient stated that he used.

On [**2113-10-20**], the patient was noted to have a new
blister form approximately 5 cm in his right lower leg, and
now both legs were hurting him.  His white blood cell count
was still noted to be decreasing.  At this point, it was 2,7000.
This was thought secondary to his azathioprine.  Thus, this
was decreased to azathioprine 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50 mg
p.o. q.h.s. from 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Dermatology was consulted to help address appropriate care of
the fluid blister that was developing on his right lower
extremity.  The left leg cellulitis was noted to be
improving.

On [**10-21**], the patient lost his peripheral intravenous
access.  In addition, his breathing was worse, and he felt
even more distressed and depressed.  He was noted to be more
lethargic, and his mental status had worsened.  He did remain
afebrile on the intravenous cefazolin and Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.

Respiratory Therapy was [**Month (only) 653**].  They helped with
aggressive suctioning, which procured two large mucous plugs.
Both were sent for culture.  Due to the change in mental
status, arterial blood gas was performed which showed a
worsening hypercarbia.

At this time, the Medical Intensive Care Unit team was called
to evaluate the patient for possible brief ventilator use
with his tracheostomy to enhance respiration.  In addition,
to give aggressive pulmonary toilet.

He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on
[**10-21**]; where they determined on chest x-ray to have seen
bilateral pleural effusions with x-rays consistent with
pulmonary edema; at which time, they diuresed him
aggressively with Lasix.  He was also kept on mechanical
ventilation with minimal pressor support.  The concern was
not to over ventilate him due to his baseline PCO2 of
approximately 60.  He was also given nebulizer therapy.

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he did have new
fevers and sputum with 4+ gram-negative rods; for which he
was covered with levofloxacin in addition to the cefazolin.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, a Urology
consultation was requested for Foley catheter pla
