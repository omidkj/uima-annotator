History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28893**] is a pleasant 87 y/o male with complex past medical
history including prior lung cancer, COPD, transitional renal
carcinoma (s/p nephrectomy with total ureterectomy in [**1-/2160**]),
BPH
s/p TURP, and recent history of pseudomonal UTI and C.Diff
infection who was recently discharged from [**Hospital **] Hospital on
[**2161-5-13**] following left hip bipolar hemiarthroplasty for chronic
hip dislocation who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] due to a [**3-13**] day history
of fatigue and loose stools, found to be hypotensive (SBPs in
the field at 73, by EMS at 89) and bradycardic (HR: 50-60s).

The patient had two recent hospitalizations at [**Hospital **] Hospital.
 He was admitted on [**2161-4-21**] for initial surgical intervention
for a left hip injury (s/p fall ~10 weeks ago), but which was
delayed due to pseudomonal UTI and symptomatic C. Diff
infection, and incidental VRE colonization in the urine.  The
patient was started on IV meropenem and oral vancomycin and
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] for [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation,
where he completed his meropenem course, and remained on oral
vancomycin.

The patient was subsequently readmitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on
[**2161-5-8**] for left hip bipolar hemiarthroplasty, which was
successfully completed and the patient was discharged on
[**2161-5-13**] back to [**Hospital3 2558**] Rehab.  Urine cultures showed
significant improvement with 1+ protein, 0-2 RBCs and 2-5 WBCs.
At [**Hospital3 2558**], the patient was recovering well, but
continued to have loose stools.  In addition, approximately [**3-13**]
days ago, the patient endorses feeling lethargic and having poor
appetite.  Eventually, due to persistently feeling "not well",
the patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**].

The patient's SBP at [**Location (un) **] was reported to be 73, while EMS
documented a SBP of 89.  In the ED, initial VS were: HR 55 and
BP 95/50, and was satting 100% on a NC.  The patient received
2.5L of NS due to concerns of dehydration and he was
subsequently admitted to the MICU for concerns of hypotension
and bradycardia.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient's VS were: T 97.5, HR 63, BP
113/83, RR 16, O2Sat 97 on RA.  The patient endorses diarrhea,
but no urinary frequency or urgency.

Past Medical History:
1.  Transitional cell renal carcinoma status post right
nephrectomy with total ureterectomy 12/[**2159**].
2.  TURP [**2128**].
3.  Hematuria and nephrolithiasis.
4.  Iron deficiency anemia.
5.  Urinary retention.
6.  Chronic kidney disease stage II.
7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
8.  Ex-smoker-quit age 30 secondary to lung cancer.
9.  Spinal stenosis.
10.  Osteopenia.
11.  Depressive disorder
12.  Tremor
13.  History of basal cell CA
[**63**].  Anxiety
15.  Vocal cord bowing.
16.  VRE colonization.
17.  Recurrent UTIs.
18.  Clostridium difficile.
19.  Left retroperitoneal sarcoma in [**2154**] with positive margins
status post resection

Social History:
The patient is a widower, his wife died approximately two years
ago.  He lives with his daughter and her family at their home in
[**Location (un) 38640**], [**State 350**].  The patient drinks one glass of
wine at dinner about 5 days a week.  He denies illicit drug use.
He smoked approximately 1-2 packs per day from age 12 to age 40,
quit after being diagnosed with early stage lung CA.  He states
he used to work for the Federal Reserve Bank, but originally was
in the Hotel Business.

IMAGING
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2161-5-21**] 2:43 PM
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of right upper lung atelectasis
versus
scarring. No definite acute cardiopulmonary process given
limitation of this significantly rotated examination.

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2161-5-21**]  3:05:14 PM
Baseline artifact. The rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with
occasional
atrial premature beats but due to baseline artifact P waves are
difficult to discern clearly. Poor R wave progression. QTc
interval prolongation. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
