Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Cardiac Catheterization
Exploratory Laparotomy

History of Present Illness:
~40yrs) who presented to an OSH with chest pain and neck pain x2
days. Pt states that he developed the acute onset of substernal
chest pressure, "like someone was sitting on my chest", one
morning earlier this week (can't remember which day). It woke
him from sleep and was associated with cold sweats and nausea.
He vomited x1 with resolution of the chest pain but he then
developed neck "throbbing" and an aching sensation in his R
forearm. He notes that the symptoms were constant throughout the
day. He was unable to eat and unable to sleep, so at 4am, he
decided to go to the hospital. Sx were not associated with SOB,
dyspnea on exertion, cough, palpitations. + cold sweats,
nausea/anorexia, and LH.

In the [**Location (un) **] ER, his initial VS were HR 220, BP 150/78, RR 28,
sats of 96% on RA. EKG revealed rapid afib w/ ST elevations in
V2-V6. His labs revealed WBC 14.7, Hct 35.2, plt 234, Na 130, K
4.0, glu 311, Cr 1.8, albumin 3.3, AST 81, ALT 61, AP 92, CK
202, CKMB 8.4, MBI 4.2, trop I 16.91. He was given ASA 325mg,
lopresor 5mg IV x2, ativan 1mg IV x1, SL ntg, 500cc NS bolus,
plavix 600mg PO x1 and heparin gtt (w/ bolus). He was
med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for intervention. At [**Hospital1 **], he went right to
the cath lab. An EKG confirmed ST elevations in an anterior
distribution. In the cath lab, the LAD was found to be occluded,
wire was able to be passed and a balloon was inflated, but there
was no restoration of flow. However, the patient was agitated
and unable to stay still so no further interventions were
attempted.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain (currently), dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope. He denies any angina preceding this event.

Mother died of breast cancer. Pt is a retired carpenter (retired
at age 62). He denies any tobacco or EtOH use (used to smoke
1ppd but quit when he retired). Lives w/ his wife.

pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple, no elevated JVP.
CV: RR, with III/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout the
precordium, radiates to axilla, not to carotids.

rhonchi.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia, rate of 104, leftward axis,
normal intervals, biphasic P waves in V1 and V2, Q waves in
V1-V4, I and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevations V2-V6 as well as I and [**First Name3 (LF) **].

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2126-11-21**] demonstrated:
R dominant system
LMCA normal
LAD occluded after large S1 and D1
LCx moderate mid disease to 50-70%
RCA diffuse <50% disease
"Initial arterial pressure 75/53, neo gtt started with SBP
90-100, change for 6 French XBLAD 3.5 guide, LAD occlusion
crossed w/ wire and dilated w/ 2.0 balloon w/o restoration of
flow. Distal injection through the balloon showed diffusely
diseased vessel w/ cutoff before apex. Because of this, late
presentation after MI and pt's inability to cooperate, procedure
terminated w/ plan for medical therapy."

HEMODYNAMICS [**2126-11-21**]:
Ao mean 25
RA mean 20, A wave 26, V wave 26
RV 43/14, end 21
PCW 23, A wave 22, V wave 27
PA 43/22, mean 30

ECHO [**11-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely
depressed (ejection fraction approximately 30 percent) secondary
to akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and
apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct;
moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation; moderate pulmonary
hypertension; hypokinetic right ventricle

ECHO [**11-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the mid anterior septum and anterior walls,
akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle, and mild
dyskinesis/aneurysm of the apex. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
(2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-11-21**],
the findings are similar.

ECHO [**11-23**]: There is a post infarction distal ventricular septal
defect (VSD) with a 1cm defect seen on 2D imaging and prominent
left-to-right flow on color Doppler. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. Regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction is similar to the prior studies (proximal/mid-LAD
distribution).

Compared with the prior study of earlier in the day, a large
ventricular septal defect is now identified. The area was not
interrogated with 2D or color Doppler on the prior study of
earlier in the day. Thus the finding may not reflect a true
interim change.

CT ABDOMEN: 1.  Focal moderate inflammation involving the
