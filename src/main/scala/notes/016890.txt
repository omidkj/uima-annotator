Chief Complaint:
 Bright Red Blood per Rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy
EGD
reb blood scans (twice)


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with a h/o GI bleeding [**2-8**] diverticuli presented to here PCP
recently for work up of fatigue and mild SOB. She was called
after lab work was drawn revealing a Hct of 18, and was told to
report urgently to the ED. In the ED she was found to have a Hct
of 15.9 and was transfered to unit. Reports she had black,
bloody stool 1 week ago but was not sure if it was due to her
iron pills. In the ICU, she was stabilized with transfusion of
PRBCs. She was sent to the floor and had upper and lower
endoscopy which revealed only nonbleeding diverticuli. She
rebled on [**12-6**] and had a tagged RBC scan that was unrevealing.
She received total 8 units of blood until then. On morning of
[**12-8**] she ambulated to the commode with PT when she passed stool
with a large amount of maroon blood and was transiently
syncopal. She then was then stabilized with NS bolus and
transferred back to the ICU. In ICU she required 2 more units of
blood, another bleeding scan done showed some leak in the cecal
area. This was discussed with IR bu they thought that the flow
rate was too slow to embolize. Surgery and GI followed her as
well. Given advanced age, surgery did not recommend emergent
surgery. GI did not recommend a repeat EGD/colonoscopy, given
low liklelyhood of identifying the cause of bleed. Also, a small
bowel study was not recommended. It was decided that in the
event reblleding occurs, IR would be contact for further
embolization.

She was transferred to the floor. On floor she ad a few episodes
of recatl bleed and needed 1 more unit transfused.

By discharge, her Hct remained stable ans she did not bleed
further. She should get weekly CBC for the next few weeks.

.
CXR [**12-3**]: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
tagged RBC scan [**2176-12-6**]: No evidence of active gastrointestinal
bleeding.
.
tagged RBC scan [**2176-12-8**]: Findings suggest active extravasation
of labeled red cells in the
right lower quadrant, most likely the cecum, first seen at 46
minutes. Findings
discussed in person with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2423**] shortly after the study.


Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: rectal bleeding, on [**2176-12-6**], Dropped Hct 10 pts in 12
hours. 37 --> 27. Tagged red cell scan negative. Repeat tagged
scan showed very slow bleed from cecum, no further bleeding
after tagged scan. Felt not to be a candidate for embolization
given very slow bleed. She was seen by surgery who recommended
conservative management. The last 3 days of her hospital stay
she had no further bleeding with stable hct. She will need to
have weekly CBCs followed as outpatient. If she has significant
bleeding in future may need embolization. Metoprolol was held
given GIB and will need to be retarted by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] PPI and
sucralfate due to patulous esophagus.

#nstemi - During the bleeding episode, she had elevated troponis
and some ST changes with resolved on transfusion. The MI was
likely from demand ischemia. Her Hct was maintailed > 30 during
the stay. She has had multiple negative stress tests in the
past. Her metoprolol was held given GI bleed and will need to
restarted as an outpatient.

# Hypocalcemia - was due to multiple PRBC transfusions. Had some
replacement IV. At dc, remained normal.

# Thrombocytopenia - due to multiple PRBC transfusions. Did not
require transfusion of plts as the count was always > 50K.

# Delerium - was multifactorial - UTI, bleed, syncope, NSTEMI.
Resolved with treatment of the individual conditions.

# Enterococcal UTI - treated with ampicillin IV initially and
then changed to oral for total of 7 days.

# Emphysema: treated prn with nebs. Remained stable.

# Evaluated by PT - back to [**Location (un) 583**] House
