Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arctic Sun Induced Hypothermia
Intubation
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II,
hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac
arrest.
.
The patient was in her ususal state of health until 2 weeks
prior to presentation. At that time she developed right leg
weakness and numbness. She presented to [**Hospital6 33**]
where she was evaluated at it was determined that she had
compression of her spinal cord and needed a laminectomy. The
patient was set to get the laminectomy and was getting sedated
with fentanyl and versed when she developed chest pain. She had
an EKG which showed inferior STEMI and she was taken to the
catheterization lab instead. At that time she was found to have
diffuse disease and had 3 BMS placed in her mid and distal left
circumflex. Her peak CK was 452, MB 27.1 and Trop T 0.93 (per
obtained labs). These downtrended and the patient was observed.
The decision was made to withhold from spinal surgery for
6-weeks. On [**2168-2-15**] the patient was sent to rehabilitation. Per
the family, she arrived at rehab and felt unwell. She initially
had chills and then became very warm. She had episodes of nausea
and some episodes of vomiting. She then collapsed at which point
it is unclear if she was responsive or had a rhythm. An
ambulance was called and she was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**]. En
route the patient has ?PEA arrest which progressed to ?asystole.
The patient received 4 rounds of CPR and epinephrine, atropine,
calcium gluconate and apparently resumed a perfusing rhythm. The
patient arrived at [**Hospital3 3583**] and was med-flighted to
[**Hospital1 18**].

 Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2168-2-16**] at 8:43:26 AM      FINAL

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall, and the mid to distal
anterolateral wall. The remaining segments contract normally.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Mild regional left ventricular
dysfunction c/w CAD. Elevated estimated filling pressures. Mild
pulmonary hypertension. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic stenosis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2168-2-15**] 11:40 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Slightly ill-defined [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation, which may be
technical.
However, close interval followup is suggested

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2168-2-16**] 2:01 AM

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-15**], there has been
placement of an OG
tube that extends well into the stomach. Endotracheal tube tip
remains in
good position. Extensive calcification is again seen in the
mitral annulus.
Opacification at the left base with obscuration of the
hemidiaphragm is
consistent with increasing atelectasis involving the left lower
lobe.

The right lung is essentially clear.
-----

  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2168-2-20**] 7:48 AM

One view. Comparison with the previous study of [**2168-2-19**].
Bilateral pleural
effusions and increased density at the left base consistent with
atelectasis
or consolidation persist. The heart and mediastinal structures
are unchanged.
A right internal jugular catheter remains in place.

IMPRESSION: No significant notable change.

Cardiology Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2168-2-22**]

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
normal.
The LAD had a 70% long proximal-mid lesion and an occluded
diagonal.
There was also diffuse distal LAD disease.  The LCx had patent
stents
with jailed LPLs with slow flow.  The RCA had a diffuse mid 90%
lesion,
and a small PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
hypertension
of 154/81 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Consult cardiac surgery regarding CABG vs. PCI
