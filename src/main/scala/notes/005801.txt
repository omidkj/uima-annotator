Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, lumbar puncture, extubation

History of Present Illness:
62 yo M with hx of HTN, DM, [**Hospital 85819**] transferred from [**Hospital6 86268**] Center after found to have SAH.  The patient was
found down in Stop and Shop, unresponsive this afternoon.  As
per
notes, it appears no specific seizure activity was witnessed,
but
it was thought by EMS that the patient was post-ictal.  He was
taken to [**Hospital6 28728**] Center.  At time of arrival his bp
was 170/100, P 110, GCS 10 (eyes - 4, verbal - 2, motor - 4).
He
was noted to become very agitated, combative, and harmful.  He
was subsequently intubated, received etomidate, rocuronium,
versed 20 mg total, ativan 2 mg, labetalol 10 mg, and
fosphenytoin 1g.  Laboratory data notable for WBC 11.9, trop <
0.01, CK 109, CO2 18, Cr 1.3.  U tox and serum tox were
negative.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  Of note, the
patient was recently started on ativan 0.5 mg tid after his wife
had passed away in [**2113-1-3**].  It is unclear if he has been
taking this daily or PRN.  ROS unobtainable.

Imaging:

CT head [**4-2**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Rounded lesion in the superior right orbit, inseparable from
the
ophthalmic vasculature on the right, likely representing an
aneurysm

MRI/A/V brain [**4-3**]:

IMPRESSION:

1. Small right superior parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, which
could be
post-traumatic in the setting of the associated right parietal
subgaleal
hematoma.

2. Mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

3. No evidence of central intracranial aneurysms. Please note
that the
location of the patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage is not
included on the MRA
of the head.

4. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

5. Nondiagnostic, technically unsuccessful neck MRA.

6. Bulbous lesion in the right orbit, intimately associated with
the superior
ophthalmic vein, which most likely represents a venous aneurysm.
Given the
presence of a gadolinium level on post-contrast images, a
lymphangioma could
also be considered. A cystic schwannoma or a hemangioma would be
much less
likely. Further evaluation could be obtained by either a CT
venogram or a
dedicated MRI of the orbits.

EEG [**4-5**] - pending

ECHO [**4-5**]:

The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). No definite regional wall motion abnormality seen.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs
of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right
sided pressures.

MR [**Last Name (Titles) 12784**] [**4-4**]:

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of vertebral body bone marrow edema, ligamentous
edema,
paraspinal soft tissue edema, or other acute traumatic injuries.


2. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament from C3
through C6,
indenting the spinal cord and causing moderate spinal canal
stenosis, worst at
C5 and C6. No evidence of associated cord signal abnormality.

3. Moderate-to-severe neural foraminal narrowing at C3-4.
Moderate neural
foraminal narrowing at C6-7.

CTA chest [**4-5**]:

IMPRESSIONS:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, noting the limitation of
superimposed
opacities obscuring lower lobe subsegmental vessels somewhat.

2. Multifocal opacities in the lungs with pleural effusions. The
appearance
is suspected to represent a combination or pneumonic
consolidations
(particularly in the right upper lobe) and extensive
atelectasis. Follow-up
chest CT is recommended to show resolution i
