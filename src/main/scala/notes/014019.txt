Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with history of lymphocytic lymphoma and recent
hospitalization two weeks ago for pneumonia and multiple
admissions for orthostatic hypotension presents from home after
falling twice in the same day in the setting of going from
sitting to standing. He denies loss of conscious but does
endorse feeling lightheaded more than usual this week. He is not
on any anticoagulation and denies any vasoactive or changes in
medications.

During his first fall this morning, he declined further
evaluation despite head strike. He then experienced a second
tumble onto his wife with again no LOC after getting dizzy.

He does endorse poor PO intake, feeling lightheaded more this
week than usual in addition to R hip pain where he had previous
surgery. He otherwise denies headache, blurry vision,
numbness/tingling, weakness, neck pain.

In the ED, initial VS were 5 97.7 91 94/59 16 93% RA FSGLC 190
Exam significant for skin tears to L arm and slight R hip,
frontal hemotoma, bruising on the extremities. Rectal was guiaic
negative. Orthostatics were positive. He was given 1 L NS
without much change in [**Age over 90 **] pressure for which a CVL was placed
with CXR confirming placement. Labs were significant for Hgb 5.9
(Baseline 7.4-9.3) with repeat of 5.9, Plt 29 (near baseline), K
5.5, BUN 42, Cr 1.9 (Baseline 1.3-1.4). Coag within normal
limits. EKG showed NSR with LAD and poor R-wave transitions
similar to prior. Head CT showed small focus of subarachnoid
hemorrhage in the right lateral sulcus just posterior to the
right insula and sylvian fissure. C-spine film was negative.
Neurosurgery was consulted for SAH and recommended repeat CT in
AM with no AED needed at this time in addition to neuro checks.
OMED was also notified of the admission. He was given 1 bag of
platelets and pRBCs were ordered before being sent to the MICU.

VS on transfer: 98.8 91 100/44 22 100 RA with GCS 15, AAOx3,
non-focal neuro exam.

On the floor, patient without any compliants or concerns.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed or other acute
intra-abdominal
process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]M with history of lymphocytic lymphoma and
recent hospitalization two weeks ago for pneumonia and multiple
admissions for orthostatic hypotension presents from home with
fall resulting in SAH with other issues including ARF from poor
PO intake, relative hypotension, and worsening anemia.

# Subarachnoid hemorrhage
Patient presented from home with a fall after getting dizzy,
resulting in skin tears on left arm and R hip pain.  NCHCT in
the ED showed Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
right lateral sulculs just posterior to the right insula.
Hemorrhage also seen in the sylvian fissure.  Small amount of
intra-ventricular [**Age over 90 **] layering in the posterior horns.  Small
para-falcine subdural hematoma.  Patient had known
thrombocytopenia prior to fall.  Neurosurgery was consulted and
did not see need for surgical intervention.  Repeat NCHCT was
stable and no interventions were necessary, and no
anti-epileptics were warranted. They did, however, recommend
that ASA be held for one week and that he f/u in [**Age over 90 **] with
repeat head CT in 4 weeks.

# Fall
Patient reported falls in setting of dizziness, and were likely
the result of orthostatic hypotension. Patient was placed on
telemetry which revealed sinus rythm, and an EKG did not show
ischemic changes. On presentation, he was initially orthostatic
and was transfused 2 units PRBCs, fluid resusitated and his
orthostatics improved.  In addition,  the patient was evaluated
by physical therapy who found no significant strength or balance
deficits to explain his fall, but did find him to be still
severely
