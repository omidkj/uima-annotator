Pertinent Results:
[**4-21**] MRI C-Spine (OSH): Cord compression at levels of C5, C6,
and C7. Extensive soft tissue edema and mild enhancement
involving the prevertebral space, ascending superiorly and
inferiorly over the entire cervical spine. This appears to
extend into the paraspinal soft tissues, most prominently over
the inferior cervical spine and at the level of C6-C7 (presumed
to represent an infection). There is an epidural abscess at the
level of C6-C7 which causes the cord compression.  Small
paraspinal abscesses also appear to extend into the longus coli
muscles at these
levels. The extensive paraspinal soft tissue inflammatory
changes and enhancement extends down to the level of the
thoracic inlet.

[**2174-4-22**] MRI Cspine
1. Status post C6-7 discectomy with no significant interval
change in
prevertebral fluid and soft tissue swelling. Interval air within
the
prevertebral soft tissues consistent with postoperative change.
2. No significant interval change in enhancing phlegmon/abscess
in the
anterior epidural space from C5 through C7 with severe spinal
canal stenosis. Cord edema cannot be completely evaluated
secondary to patient motion artifact.
3. Persistent soft tissue enhancement within the paraspinous
soft tissues at C6-7.

[**2174-4-23**] MRI L-spine
1. No finding to suggest vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis or
epidural
abscess in the lumbar spine.
2. No pathologic focus of enhancement.
3. L2-3 and L3-4: Disc degeneration, likely related to the
levoscoliosis. At L3-4, an eccentric disc bulge to right narrows
the caudal aspect of that neural foramen, likely impinging upon
the exiting right L3 nerve root.

[**2174-4-23**] MRI C, T-spine
Postoperative changes in the cervical spine with no definite
evidence for a residual epidural abscess, although evaluation is
limited due to artifact.
Slight interval increase in size of a collection in the right
antero lateral neck extending to the midline prevertebral space.
This is likely to be a postoperative collection and recommend
attention on followup imaging.

[**2174-4-27**] LENS
[**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler images of both common femoral,
superficial
femoral, popliteal and proximal calf veins were obtained. There
was
wall-to-wall flow with normal response to compression and
augmentation in all visible veins. No DVT was present.
IMPRESSION: No DVT in either lower extremity.

[**2174-4-30**] CT C-spine
1. Prominent right paratracheal anterior neck soft tissue
stranding with
air-fluid collections increased from MRI of [**2174-4-23**] concerning
for infection  or hemorrhage. Further evaluation is limited due
to lack of contrast. MRI or contrast-enhanced CT are recommended
for further evaluation.
2. Probably expected post-surgical appearance of the anterior
cervical fusion device at C5-8 with C6-7 corpectomy and regional
prevertebral soft tissue prominence. No additional focal osseous
abnormality.

[**2174-5-1**] MRI C-spine
Somewhat increasing extent of fluid within the prevertebral soft

tissues at the caudal extent of the internal fixation device. It
is
impossible to determine whether this fluid is sterile or
infected, nor
whether the paraspinal soft tissue enhancing region is infected,
either.

[**2174-5-3**] Left Lower Extremity Ultrasound
no evidence of deep vein thrombosis






Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 86056**] was admitted and brought emergently to the OR for
ACDF C6-7 for drainage of abcess.  She tolerated this procedure
and remained intubated and transferred to ICU.  Her post op exam
showed poor motor function in upper extremities and no movement
in lowers.  She had repeat MRI that showed decompression of
abcess but continued collection behind C6 and 7 vertebral bodies
so she returned to OR for corpectomies C6 and 7.

She was recovered in the ICU and was extubated on post op day
#2.  ID consult was obtained and recommendations followed.
Patient was placed on naficillin 2g IV Q4H for staph coag +
cultures. Patient was transferred to step down on [**4-26**]. Patient
developed dysphasia and a dophoff was recommended. An IVC filter
was placed as well as the dophoff in the OR on [**4-27**]. On [**4-28**], a
nutrition consult and speech and swallow eval was ordered.
Nutrition decreased her tubefeeds to goal rate of 62ml/hr and
speech and swallow allowed her to take in pureed foods with
nectar-thick liquids. Her strength comtinues to improve, but she
remains weak distally in UE and LE.

She failed a voiding trial overnight into [**4-30**]. A CT C-spine was
done for this reason. There was suspicion of new soft tissue
collection and MRI +/- was recommended by radiology. This was
done on [**5-1**] and there was no sign of cord compression or
hardware movement. She was afebrile. TEE was ordered per ID reqs
but not performed due to absolute contraindication (per
cardiology). ID is understanding and currently recommends
longterm course (6-8wks plus) of nafcillin with outpt follow up
and weekly labs.

On [**5-2**] pt was seen in follow up by speech and swallow. Per
their recommendations her diet was advanced to ground, her tube
feeds & NGT were d/c'd. She was also started on calorie counts
and ensure puddings. She was also seen by PT/OT and they have
recommended discharge to inpatient rehab.

On [**5-3**] the patient was again seen by speech and swallow, who
recommended increasing diet to soft solids and thin liquids. Pt
continued with clamping of foley catheter with unclamping every
4 hours for bladder training. She complained of some tenderness
in her left lower extremity (questionable edema) therefore an
ultrasound was obtained which revealed no deep vein thrombosis.
At this time the patient was cleared for discharge to inpatient
rehabilitation facility.
