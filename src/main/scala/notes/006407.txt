HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with past medical history significant for end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis secondary to hypertension with failed
cadaveric kidney transplant. She has congestive heart failure
and question of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She
has had past multiple admissions for Clostridium difficile
colitis since [**70**]/[**2173**]. During her last Intensive Care Unit
admission in [**3-/2173**], she was started on p.o. vancomycin
taper with good response and p.o. vancomycin was discontinued
when stool samples were negative times three. However, the
patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 649**] from [**2173-5-25**] to [**2173-5-29**] for diarrhea,
weight loss and failure to thrive. The patient recently was
started on levofloxacin for question of phlebitis and also
was started on 5 mg of prednisone. The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for septic shock. The
patient presented with a temperature of 100.6, systolic blood
pressure in the 60s, white blood cell count of 56,000, was
tachycardiac to 150, tachypneic to 30 and was placed on
Pravachol after blood pressure dropped down to the 70s over
40s, status post 1.5 liters of normal saline.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease status post failed renal
    transplant on hemodialysis.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Multiple admissions for Clostridium difficile colitis in
    [**1-/2173**] and 04/[**2173**].
5.  Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
6.  Dysphagia.
7.  History of urinary tract infections.
8.  Status post cholecystectomy.
9.  Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-
    oophorectomy.
10. Status post lumbar laminectomies.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, sulfa and likely allergic to
levofloxacin as the patient tends to develop Clostridium
difficile colitis while on levofloxacin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature
100.1, blood pressure 79/44, heart rate 133, O2 saturation
100 percent on room air.
GENERAL:  The patient is a cachectic, frail female in no
apparent distress.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Sclera
anicteric. Mucous membranes were dry. Oropharynx clear.
NECK:  Supple. No jugular venous distension.
HEART:  Irregularly irregular, tachycardiac.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation. No wheezes.
ABDOMEN:  Thin, firm, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, dry, no edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is alert and oriented. Cranial
nerves II-XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
56.6, hematocrit 40.4, platelets 299. Chem-7 showed a sodium
of 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 19, BUN 29,
creatinine 2.5, glucose 69, lactate of 3.6.

The patient had a CT scan of the abdomen done that showed
consistent with colitis. No evidence of free air. No evidence
of abscess. A probable hepatic cyst. Also, a small right
pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Septic shock:  The patient presented with a white blood
   cell count in the 70s with 10 percent bandemia. There was
   concern of infectious etiology for the shock. The patient
   was later found to have Clostridium difficile positive
   stool with inactive blood cultures. The patient was
   started with intravenous Flagyl and p.o. vancomycin for
   treatment of Clostridium difficile and continued with
   intravenous fluid bolus. The patient's blood pressure
   returned to [**Location 213**] after admission to the Medical
   Intensive Care Unit for observation and stayed in the
   Medical Intensive Care Unit for two days. The patient was
   then transferred out to the floor.

2. Colitis:  The patient's abdominal CT was consistent with
   colitis and also has Clostridium difficile positive stool.
   The patient was started on intravenous Flagyl and p.o.
   vancomycin. Gastrointestinal was consulted and the patient
   was later discontinued of intravenous Flagyl after
   diarrhea had improved significantly and continued on p.o.
   vancomycin. The patient will be discharged to
   rehabilitation and continued with vancomycin taper.

3. Failure to thrive:  The patient reported having loss of
   appetite in the past and has been feeling quite depressed
   due to her medical condition. Psychiatry was consulted and
   recommended starting Rezulin and change the Ambien for
   sleeping p.o. to trazodone. The patient has improved p.o.
   intake and the patient was started on TPN for a few days
   and then discontinued. She will resume TPN only during
   dialysis sessions. Nutrition was also consulted and will
   count the calories. Given that the patient has a
   significant depression disorder and we are treating the
   depression, we are hoping that given the depression has
   been treated, the patient will slowly improve in terms of
   her p.o. intake. If the patient does not improve her p.o.
   intake after a few weeks while on Rezulin, then she will
   need to be reevaluated for the reason of failure to thrive
   and the reason of anorexia.

4. Supraventricular tachycardia:  Labetalol was initially
   held for hypotension and then restarted [**2173-6-4**] to
   control both the heart rate after the blood pressure was
   stable. The patient's heart rate continued to be on the
   higher end, so we increased labetalol from 100 mg b.i.d.
   to 200 mg b.i.d. with good effect.

5. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis:  The patient
   continued hemodialysis per Renal schedule and has
   increased Epogen dosage due to her anemia.

6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Continue nebulizer
   treatments.

7. Anemia:  We worked up causes of her anemia and she has a
   high ferritin level and has low TIBC and iron level
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease. We will just
   transfuse the patient as needed. The patient's hematocrit
   has been stable throughout her hospital stay. The patient
   may need colonoscopy in the future given that she has one
   episode of guaiac positive stool, but this can be done on
   an outpatient basis.

8. Depression:  Psychiatry was consulted and the patient was
   started on Rezulin and trazodone p.r.n. We will just
   continue the medication and reevaluate as necessary.

ambulating with assistance.
