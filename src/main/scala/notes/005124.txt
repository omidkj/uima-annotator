Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
81 yo with history of asthmatic bronchitis and dementia who
presents with 3 weeks of worsening shortness of breath.
.
He was admitted on [**2114-11-22**] for a TURP due to BPH. Since then, he
has been having worsening SOB over the last 3 weeks. He has also
been needing nebulizer treatments more often. He called Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] 1.5 weeks ago and his prednisone dose was increased
from 10 to 20mg. He has since tapered his dose to 15mg po daily
and today was his first dose of 10mg. He has also been having
worsening confusion and agitation over the last several days,
which tends to happen when he gets more hypoxic. Denies fevers.
Has had cough productive of yellow sputum. He went to geriatrics
clinic today and found to have an O2 sat of 88%RA and was sent
to the hospital.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.4 87 139/66 24 88%RA. He was
given combivent x3 and 125mg IV solumedrol. His O2 sats improved
to 91%RA, mid 90's on 2-3L NC. He also had an episode of acute
agitation and was given 0.5mg Xanax, seroquel and trazodone.
Most recent vitals were 96.8 112 122/72 95%2-3L.
.
On the floor, he is responsive to sternal rub and will open his
eyes to pain but not to voice. He appears comfortable. His
daughters corroborate that he commonly gets sedated at home
after his nighttime seroquel and trazodone.
.
The following morning, he acutely developed SOB, desated to the
30s, improved to 80s with non-rebreather. Code blue was called
for respiratory failure, ABG was 7.09/101/59/32 prior to
interventions. He was given 1x IV solumedrol, lasix IV 40 x1,
nitro [**1-20**] inch, his bp was 160's, tachy to 150s, cyanotic
initally, but improved with treatment and ambu bag. He was
transferred to MICU Green for BIPAP treatment. Family was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and he is a full code.
.
In MICU green, he improved gradually with BIPAP, need to get
CXR, repeat ABG, continue IV salumedrol 80 q8h for now, standing
nebs.

ECG [**2114-12-14**]:
Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2113-12-8**] no
change.

CXR (PA & LAT) [**2114-12-14**]:
TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
are normal, re-demonstrating a tortuous aorta. Atherosclerotic
calcification is noted of the aortic arch. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. Increased density medially in the
right lower lobe may be atelectatic, or related to technique,
though an infection in that location is not excluded.

Portable cxr [**2114-12-15**]:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Lungs are essentially
clear except for minimal bibasilar atelectasis. There is no
appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax developed in the
interim.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo with history of asthmatic bronchitis and dementia who
presents 3 weeks of worsening SOB, admitted for COPD
exacerbation, and transferred to ICU for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.
.
#. Repiratory failure: Pt presented with worsening cough,
hypoxia, shortness of breath, and wheezing on physical exam
consistent with an exacerbation of his underlying obstructive
lung disease (asthmatic bronchitis). Per family, symptoms began
when prednisone had been tapered.  He was treated with IV
solumedrol and transitioned to po prednisone with a long taper.
He was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs and started on a 7 day
course of doxycycyline (pt was allergic to azithromycin) for
bronchitis.  On [**2114-12-15**] code blue was called when pt was found
to have oxygen saturation of 40s.  CXR at that point was
remarkable only for bibasilar atelectasis.  ABG showed pH of
7.09, PCO2 of 101, and PO2 of 59.  He was transferred to MICU
for hypercarbic hypoxemic resp failure and started on BiPAP with
rapid improvement in symptoms.  MICU course was complicated by
brief desaturation to 80s but with subsequent improvement with
nebs.  He had a speech & swallow assessment due to concern for
aspiration.  However, bedside evaluation was limited by lack of
pt cooperation.  Video swallow was recommended for further
evaluation but pt's family preferred that he be given food
despite the potential risk of aspiration.  Risks of aspiration
were explained and it was decided not to pursue video swallow
assessment a
