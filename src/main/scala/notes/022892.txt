Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
# Head and neck cancer:
- Mr. [**Known lastname 35716**] presented with a pain in his right neck. A lump
developed in the area and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**]
and laryngoscopy demonstrated a post-cricoid hypopharyngeal
lesion and was referred to have a CT scan of the neck. The CT
scan of the neck revealed an enhancing mass in the right
pyriform sinus with extensive conglomerate adenopathy in the
right level 2 and level 3 nodes. Biopsy of the mass was positive

for squamous cell carcinoma. On [**2197-4-13**] he underwent
direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of right pyriform sinus lesion
and rigid esophagoscopy. Pathology from this procedure revealed
squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated. He was HPV
negative. Port was placed [**2197-5-5**]. He started C1D1 of cisplatin,
docetaxel, 5-FU on [**2197-5-5**].
# prostate cancer: status post radical prostatectomy
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] in [**2188**]. He had a biochemical recurrence in [**2194**],
status post salvage radiation therapy and has since followed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with anundetectable PSA in [**2196-11-3**].

Non-oncologic history:
- hypertension
- acid reflux disease with hiatal hernia
- hernia repair in [**2177**]
- appendectomy in [**2149**]

IMAGING
CXR - 1. Focal opacity at the left lung base, could be focal
consolidation;
however, cannot exclude nodule in a patient with cancer history,
although less likely. D/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Son [**Name (NI) **].
2. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern, with a few scattered air-fluid
levels in
the right upper abdominal quadrant.
.
[**2197-7-4**]: Chest X ray
IMPRESSION:
Increase of the left lung opacity consistent with worsening
pneumonia.
.
[**2197-7-5**] Chest X ray:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube
projects 4 cm above the carina with its tip. The course of the
nasogastric
tube is unchanged. Also unchanged is the course of the right
pectoral
Port-A-Cath.
Newly appeared bilateral parenchymal opacities, notably in the
perihilar
areas, suggest pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia.
Progressing
retrocardiac atelectasis, the presence of a small left pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. No other relevant changes.
.
[**2197-7-6**] Chest X ray:
Comparison is made with multiple prior studies including all
performed the day before.
Cardiac size is top normal. Lines and tubes remain in place in
standard
position. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural
effusions. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities worse in
the left lung have minimally improved in the right lower lobe.
These are a combination of pulmonary edema and preexisting left
lung p
