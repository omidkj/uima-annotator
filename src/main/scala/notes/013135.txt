Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
"Ventricular tachycardia with 3 shocks".

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia ablation
2. Thyroidectomy


History of Present Illness:
77 yr old pt with hx of large anterior wall infarct in [**2103**],
cardiac arrest [**2112**], s/p AICD, treated with Amiodarone over last
several years for VT. He is s/p upgrade to BIV ICD in [**2123**] and
s/p VT ablation at CMC several years ago and again this summer.
This summer, his amiodarone had to be stopped after he became
hyperthyroid. He was treated with steroids and Tapozole, however
free T4 is still 1.78, and TSH is 0.133. As a result, he has
been on Mexilitine since the summer. He presented this weekend
to St. [**Hospital 11042**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 8117**], NH after being shocked by
his AICD three times on [**Holiday 1451**]. The patient reports he
"felt different as if he might pass out" for a fleeting second.
He also notes lightheadedness right before his first shock. He
felt normal for 2 seconds, and then received two subsequent
shocks. He denies feeling chest pain or shortness of breath at
that time. He went to St. [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Location (un) 8117**]. At that
point, he was restarted on PO amiodarone. Since restarting
amiodarone, he has been stable with no recurrent episodes of VT.
He is currently on telemetry for monitoring. He is being
transferred for further management of VT, and evaluation for
possible VT Ablation. Also, of note the patient is on warfarin
for Low EF.
.
ROS: + BPH like symptoms
- He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He sleeps on
two pillows at night.

Imaging:
[**2126-12-5**] CXR: 1. Opacification in right lower lung may represent
pneumonia versus loculated pleural effusion versus pleural or
parenchymal-based mass. CT is advised for further evaluation. 2.
Right-sided pleural effusion.

[**2126-12-9**] CXR: 1. Stable opacification in the right lower lobe
likely represents loculated pleural effusion, but pneumonia or
mass cannot be excluded. CT is recommended for further
evaluation. 2. Stable free small right pleural effusion.

[**2126-12-9**] UENI: Nonocclusive thrombus expanding the basilic vein
of the right upper extremity. Patent deep venous system in the
right upper
extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo male history of old anterior wall infarct, multiple
cardiac arrests s/p ICD, ischemic cardiomyopathy last EF 22% on
warfarin, hyperthyroidism [**2-5**] amio toxicity, stage 3 CKD and two
prior VT ablations admitted after three ICD shocks on
[**Holiday 1451**], now s/p VT ablation and thyroidectomy, back on
amiodarone.

#VT: Transferred from OSH for VT ablation.  Amiodarone started
at OSH, but stopped upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] given possible VT
ablation.  Patient underwent VT mapping and ablation, during
which he was put on dopamine and neosynephrine.  He quickly
weaned off of these pressors and was extubated.   He was
transferred to the CCU for observation overnight.  He came back
to the medical floor the next morning.  He had further episodes
of VT the next day, the
