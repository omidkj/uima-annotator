Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99948**] is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer with
mets to lung and brain, s/p several rounds of [**Last Name (LF) 3454**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and
whole chest xrt, who presents from [**Hospital **] hospital with one
day of shortness of breath.  About one week ago, he was
diagnosed by his oncologist with pneumonia after several days of
productive cough and was started on levofloxacin and flagyl.
Two days prior to admission, he was admitted overnight to
[**Hospital 47**] hospital for altered mental status [**3-19**] hypoglycemia.
He was feeling better from a respiratory standpoint when he was
discharged on the day prior to admission.  This morning, the
patient felt more SOB.  He normally uses O2 at home, 3L with
exertion, but found himself needing up to 5L at home today even
at rest.  Has a cough but no sputum production.  Denies fever,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weakness.  His wife called 911
and he was brought back to [**Hospital 47**] hospital ED.  There he was
noted to have a low-grade temp to 100.3 and hypoxic to mid-80s
on a NRB.  The patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1, P 133, BP 106/72, R 24, O2
sat 91% on NRB.  He was notably SOB but speaking in full
sentences.  He was hypoxic to the mid-80s to low 90s on NRB.  He
was given a combivent neb, however became more hypoxic (to low
80s) and tachycardic (to 130s) with this and so it was stopped.
CXR showed a RLL opacity.  He was given vanco and cefepime for
empiric pna coverage.  He was also started on a heparin gtt and
given IVF.
.
On the floor, he reports that his breathing feels much better.
He has no other complaints currently except that he is hungry
and thirsty.


Past Medical History:
Esophageal cancer
History of PE in [**2142**] (on chronic lovenox)
HTN
DMII, likely secondary to steroids
History of erythema multiforme in [**2142**] (likely [**3-19**] keppra
+/- dilantin)
History of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] in late '70s (unclear cause)
S/p appendectomy '[**11**]
.
Onc History:
The patient originally presented in [**2140-8-14**] with headache,
confusion, disorientation and visual changes.  An outside
hospital brain MRI showed a large right occipital hemorrhagic
mass on [**2140-9-18**].  He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.  Torso
CT showed multiple primary nodules, esophageal wall thickening
and right renal mass.  Craniotomy on [**2140-9-23**] revealed
adenocarcinoma that was CK20 and CDX positive for adenocarcinoma
that was eventually evaluated and felt consistent with
esophageal origin.  He had radiosurgery to the resection cavity
on [**2140-11-3**] to 1800 cGy.  He was then seen at the
[**Hospital 4601**] Cancer Center for treatment of his esophageal
carcinoma.  He received six cycles of CPT-11 and cisplatin
there. He was then discontinued off his regimen because of
increased creatinine.  In middle of [**2141-4-15**], he was started
on
oxaliplatin and 5-FU.  The oxaliplatin was discontinued in end
of
[**2141-5-16**] after two cycles of neuropathy.  He was continued
only
on 5-FU.  He then had some evidence of progression of disease
and
then was changed to Taxol and carboplatin.  On [**2141-11-29**]
torso CT showed continued evidence of progression of disease.
He
was then switched over to CPT-11 and cisplatin.  He had received
two cycles of this, but had increasing dysphagia.  In the
interval, a [**2141-9-4**] brain MRI had shown a tiny high right
parietal metastasis, which was treated on [**2141-10-6**] to 2200 cGy.
In [**2142-1-15**], there were a couple of new lesions that
were concerning for new metastasis.  He underwent whole brain
radiation at [**Hospital6 **], which was completed
[**2142-2-16**].  This was complicated by post-radiation necrosis.  PET
scan on [**2142-6-21**] was negative. A torso CT earlier in [**Month (only) 116**] had
shown no disease below the diaphragm, with only small pulmonary
nodules that were slowly growing.  At this point, the plan was
conservative management of the patient with serial imaging.
In [**Month (only) 116**], he was started on a course of steroids.


Social History:
Lives with wife and 18 year-old son.  Retired, formerly worked
as drug and alcohol counselor at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital (retired
after being diagnosed with esophageal ca). No history of EtOH or
tobacco use

Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 99.9, BP: 116/73, P: 116, R: 31, O2: 93% on high flow
mask
General: Alert, oriented, middle-aged man in no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, bronchial breath
sounds at the left base, no wheezes or rales
CV: tachycardic, regular, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
.
CXR:
1. Total collapse of the left lower lobe.
2. Patchy opacity in the medial right lower lobe. This may
represent
aspiration and/or pneumonia.
3. Innumerable pulmonary nodules presumably secondary to
metastatic disease.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Chest CT:
1. Bibasilar consolidation, more likely atelectasis than
pneumonia.
2. Increased size and number of numerour lung metastases.
Progressive
bilateral hilar adenopathy, producing bronchial obstruction,
right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe
probably contributing to
atelectasis.
3. Local lymphangitic tumor extension to the right lower lobe
and confluent metastases producing atelectasis in the left upper
lobe are new and there has been progression of mediastinal
adenopathy particularly at the thoracic inlet. Generalized
increase in size of the long lower esophageal tumor is not
accompanied by obvious invasion of local mediastinal organs,
despite new small pericardial effusion.
4. Small layering pleural effusions, probably due to cardiac
decompensation producing minimal edema, progressed on subsequent
chest radiograph of [**8-22**].
5. Left renal or juxtarenal mass increased since [**2140**].



Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital 153**] Hospital course:
.
#  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  Upon admission, the patient was
in acute hypoxic distress requiring almost 100% FiO2 high flow
oxygen.  His acute decompensation was most likely secondary to
pneumonia compounded by metastatic esophageal disease.  PE was
thought to be less likely despite the positive history of PE and
malignancy, especially as the patient was on prophylaxtic
lovenox at home.  Dopplers of the lower extremities were
negative for DVT.  A TTE with bubble study showed no evidence of
intracardiac shunt.  Upon admission, the patient was started on
empiric antibiotic course of vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP.
Tobramycin was added for double coverage after blood cx from the
emergency department grew GNR, but was discontinued once
sensitivities were back.  Additionally, the patient received
albuterol and atrovent inhalers PRN, was gently diuresed with
lasix, and was encouraged to ambulate/ use incentive spirometry
to prevent atelectasis.  Despite completing an 8 day course of
vancomycin and a (14) day course of ceftazadime (switch from
cefepime on day 10 of therapy due to new susceptibility report
of GNR), the patient's respiratory status did not improve
significantly.  A thoracic CT w/o contrast confirmed diffuse
metastatic disease compressing the bronchioles and the patient's
respiratory compromise was largely irreversible.  Prior to
transfer from the ICU, the patient was referred to palliative
care (see below).  At time of discharge from ICU the patient was
stable on high flow oxygen with 60% FiO2
