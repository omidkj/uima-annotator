Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mild-moderate regional LV systolic
dysfunction. Estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (?#). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the basal inferior septum, inferior, and inferolateral and
distal septal walls with mild hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular
cavity enlargement with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2118**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**4-6**] Mr. [**Known lastname 23440**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an urgent coronary artery bypass
grafting times three (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to L PDA).
Please see the operative note for details.  He tolerated this
procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable
condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  He was extubated
and weaned from pressors by the following day.  He was
transferred to the surgical step down floor.  His chest tubes
and wires were removed.  The physical therapy service saw him in
consult.  By post operative day four he was ready for discharge
to home.  All follow-up appointments were advised.
