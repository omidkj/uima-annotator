Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Cholangitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8029**] is a 74 M with a medical history notable for
cholecystectomy and post-cholecystectomy cholangitis requiring
ERCP in [**2144**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. He reports intermittent biliary colic for
the past year. However, on [**2-21**] he noted a [**11-25**] RUQ pain that
did not improve. He became weak and delirious and his wife
called 911. [**Name2 (NI) **] initially presented to his local hospital and
shortly after arrival he spiked a fever and his SBP dropped to
the 80s. His initial evaluation was notable for the following:
ALT 722, AST 365, alk phos 241, lipase 470, bili 3.1, and a CT
scan that revealed common bile duct dilation and possible
gallstones. He received IV fluids, Vancomycin, and Zosyn. His
blood pressure was fluid-responsive and did not require
vasoactive medications. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED he recieved additional IV fluids and
Unasyn. He then went for ERCP on [**2154-2-22**]. The ERCP revealed a
single 15 mm round stone that was partially-obstructing and pus
in the biliary tree. A double pigtail biliary stent was placed
and he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. While
in the ICU he required no vasoactive medications to support his
blood pressure and was not intubated. One of his admission blood
cultures grew gram negative rods and his antibiotics were
changed from Unasyn to cefepime and gentamycin. Other active
issues in the ICU included a rising white blood cell count
without additional fevers, acute renal failure that improved
with IV fluids, and left upper extremity swelling of unclear
etiology.

On arrival to the floor he noted no abdominal pain. He had no
nausea and was hungry.

Review of Systems: Pain assessment on arrival to the floor: 0/10
(no pain). No recent illnesses other than above. No SOB, cough,
or chest pain. No urinary symptoms. No arthralgias or joint
swelling. Other systems reviewed in detail and all otherwise
negative.

gastric ulcers status post Billroth-I gastric resection

hypertension

ERCP ([**2154-2-22**]): Previous sphincterotomy noted. Cannulation of the
biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using
a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected resulting in
complete opacification. A single 15 mm round stone that was
causing partial obstruction was seen at the biliary tree with
pus  suggesting cholangitis
A 5cm by 10FR double pigtail biliary stent was placed
successfully

U/S LUE ([**2154-2-23**]): No evidence of DVT in the left upper
extremity. Non-visualization of the left basilic vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cholangitis:  Underwent succesful ERCP on [**2-22**] but will need
repeat ERCP to confirm duct clearance in [**5-22**] weeks.  In addition
to ERPC, treated with supportive care and antibiotics (cipro
sensitive e.coli grew in blood).

2. Bacteremia:  Initially treated emperically with cefepime and
gentamicin, but this was narrowed to ciprofloxacin given
sensitivies.  10 days planned.

3. Acute renal failure:  Improved with supportive care with
creatinine at baseline 1.1

4. Right upper extremity swelling:  Unclear cause; LENI was
negative.  Treated with elevation with improvement noted.

5. Thrush:  Noted on hospital day [**4-19**].  Improved with nystatin
oral.

6. Type II Diabetes without complications:  Metformin and
Januvia were held on admission but restarted on discharged.
Insulin used as inpatient.

7. Hypertension:  Continued on carvedilol; ACE inhibitor and
Lasix were intially held but both were resumed at discharge.

8. Chronic lumbar back pain:  Home standing Oxycontin was
decreased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing from TID given renal failure and illness
but also written for PRN oxycodone.  Resumed TID on discharge.

9. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to critical illness.
