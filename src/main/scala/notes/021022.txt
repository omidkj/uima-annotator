[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], SIADH p/w abd pain and vomiting. Had been feeling
well until one month ago when she began feeling abd pain again.
She presented to ED and had CTA neg for mesenteric ischemia. She
continued to have abd pain intermittently not a/w food. No
fever, no diarrhea. Nml BM yesterday. Initially hypertensive,
but improved w/ morphine pain control. Again hypertensive on the
floor. She was guiac positive in the ED but not melanotic. CTA
abd was negative for signs of ischemia.

Past Medical History:
# Recent admission for abdominal pain and also recurrent
mesenteric ischemia and SMA [**First Name3 (LF) **]
# Ischemia of Right Colon with Transmural Infaction of Cecum
# CHF
# HTN
# [**First Name3 (LF) **] on aggrenox with known carotid artery disease

# Mild-moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] [**2164**], with preserved EF
# Vertigo/chronic dizziness
# chronic anemia
# chronic hyponatremia likley from SIADH


Social History:

about in garden, making breakfast.
.


Family History:
 Mother with brain tumor. Multiple relatives living into their
90s.

Physical Exam:
Vitals - afebrile, satting well on room air.
GENERAL: A/OX3, comfortable
HEENT: No JVD
CARDIAC: RRR, II/VI systolic murmur, distant heart sounds
LUNG: Decreased breath sounds in bases B
ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND, BS+, no HSM
EXT: Trace edema of LE's B
NEURO: Moving all extremities, speaking clearly in italian


Pertinent Results:
CTA abd/pelvis [**11-27**]
1. Patent mesenteric vasculature, with prior SMA [**Month/Year (2) **],
unchanged. No
evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
2. Unchanged extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and
branches.
3. Sigmoid diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
CXR [**11-29**] There is blunting of both CP angles posteriorly and
increase in
lung markings in both lower lungs. It is unclear if this is due
to volume
loss or early infiltrates.
.
[**2172-12-4**] CT HEAD w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality. MRI is more
sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia/infarct.
.
[**2172-12-4**] CXR PA and Lat:IMPRESSION:
1. Rapidly developing consolidation in lower lungs probably
indicates
aspiration pneumonia.
2. Increasing cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary edema, and
increased pleural effusion are indicative of superimposed
cardiac failure.
.
[**2172-12-7**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute infarction.
2. Grossly unchanged diffuse intracranial atherosclerosis
without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.
Unchanged ulcerated plaque or 2 mm aneurysm involving the
cavernous left carotid artery.
.
[**2172-12-7**] CXR: REPEAT DICTATION:
The initial report provided for this clip number is not the
correct report for this patient. Please see the corrected
dictation as follows:
.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged since [**2172-12-4**] CXR.
Improving
opacity in the right middle lobe may reflect improving
atelectasis considering rapid improvement and the presence of
marked right middle lobe volume loss on prior lateral chest
radiograph, but attention to this area on a followup PA and
lateral radiograph prior to discharge would be helpful.
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and adjacent left pleural
effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia - Moraxella in sputum and left-lower lobe pneumonia
on chest x-ray.  Required supplemental oxygen.  Started on
empiric treatment for community acquired pneumonia with
ceftriaxone (10-day) and azithromycin (5-day), both completed
while in house.  Required benzonatate and codeine for cough
suppression and physical therapy consult for chest physical
therapy.  Weaned off of O2.
.
# Abdominal pain, nausea: Pt. states that pain was similar to
her prior episode of mesenteric ischemia, but it resolved after
a dose of morphine. CTA was negative, lactate not elevated.
Guiac + but no gross blood, probably dark from iron pills.
Remained pain free after day of admission. Advised to f/u as
outpt. w/ PCP to [**Name9 (PRE) 18798**] chronic mesenteric ischemia. Hct dropped
on admission but then remained stable.
.
# Hypertensive Urgency: Systolic blood pressure repeatedly
greater than 210, despite multiple agents (metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **],
amlodipine 10mg, valsartan 40mg, hydralazine 25mg QID).  Added
on hydrochlorothiazide and increased valsartan.  Aldosterone
level checked in [**2170**] was WNL.  Patient started on a clonidine
patch.  Her goal systolic blood pressures are < 180.  An
apointment was made with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to evaluate his hypertension
and any possible further workup or intervention.
.
# Hyponatremia: On previous admission was diagnosed with SIADH.
During this admission, urine sodium was low and urine osmolarity
was > 200, suggesting pre-renal state.  She was given IV fluids
with resolution of hyponatremia.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Initially
euvolemic, but after receiving IV antibiotics and fluids, chest
x-ray demonstrated overload and she had a decrement in pulse
oximetry.  Given PRN doses of furosemide 20-40mg.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Was initially
elevated to > 2.0, improved with IV fluids, back to baseline of
1.6.  Valsartan was held temporarily and restarted after
creatinine returned to baseline
