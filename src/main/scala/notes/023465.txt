History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with hx of CAD, CRI, HTN and afib, presents to
teh [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2171-5-7**] for evaluation of GIB. Patient presented to
[**Hospital3 1280**] on [**2171-4-28**] with BRBPR and a HCT of 25.5. A
colonoscopy perfromed there revealed blood and old clots
throughout with no obvious source identified. The rectosigmoid
was noted to look inflamed with ? of mild ischemia. Patient had
an EGD that revealed esophagitis and gastritis. 4 U PRBC and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for management. Patient was abmitted to
the SICU. Here his abmission HCT was 38.3. Here bleeding scan
negative for source of active bleeding, but study limited due to
contrast in the abdomen. Patient also noted at that time to be
hypotensive, and started on dopamine-changed to lepaphed and
neosenephrine. Patient also received Vit K, 4U FFP. Patient's
HCTs in the SICU as follows: 38.3 ([**5-7**]), 26.0 (txd 2 U PRBC),
31.6, 27.9 , 34.6. Patient has been off pressors since [**5-8**]/ at
0400, and has remained hemodynamically stable. Cards, GI and
Renal consulted in SICU and following. Patient with Maroon stool
in SICU, but no BRBPR or active bleeding. Patient was
transferred out to the floor on [**2171-5-10**] and went into respiratory
failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema from diastolic
dysfunction. Patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU.
Patient was exubated the following day after diuresis and
hemodialysis. Patient was transfused 2 more units of blood and
had a colonoscopy on [**2171-5-13**] before being transferred to the
floor.

Colonoscopy: Polyps found in the transverse and distal colon;
polypectomy not done given recent GI bleed.

Endoscopy: Linear erythema of mucosa was noted in the stomach
body.  Findings consistent with gastritis

Right upper extremity ultrasound: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, subclavian,
axillary, brachial, and left subclavian veins were performed. A
small amount of non-occlusive fibrinous material is demonstrated
within the right internal jugular vein. No thrombus is
identified in the right subclavian or axillary veins. There are
small hypoechoic subcutaneous collections demonstrated in the
right upper arm consistent with hematomas. Note is made of a
right cephalic to brachial AV fistula, which limits evaluation
of the distal waveforms. Limited evaluation of the right
brachial vein demonstrates no evidence for occlusive thrombus

Echocardiogram [**2171-5-8**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.  There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.  Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.  LVEF 50-60%




Brief Hospital Course:
## GI bleed:  Workup at outside hospital negative.  Patient had
colonscopy and endoscopy done while in hospital.  The
colonoscopy showed polyps in the transverse and distal colon and
the EGD was showed gastritis.  Patient was put on Protonix [**Hospital1 **].
The polyps that were found were not removed given the fact that
the patient had recent GI bleed.  Patient will need a repeat
colonoscopy in about 1 month to have polyps removed.  Patient
also underwent pill endoscopy to find a possible source of
bleeding in the small bowel, results will be forwarded to
patient's primary care doctor for further follow up if needed.
.
## Resp Failure - When patient was initially transferred to
floor from surgery ICU he became hypoxic and needed to be
intubated.  The most likely cause was flash pulmonary edema
since patient was getting IVF.  In the MICU patient was started
on hemodialysis and his respiratory status greatly improved.  He
was extubated after 24 hours.  Serial chest xrays showed that
the patient has bilateral pleural effusions which improved after
dialysis.  Once patient was continued on HD his O2 requirements
greatly decreased.
.
# Renal Failure: Most likely secondary to HTN and DM. Patient
had tunnel cath placed and initiated on hemodialysis which he
will now need permanantly.  Continued nephro caps.  Patient has
been setup with outpatient HD and will continue to see his
primary nephrologist outpatient.
.
## HTN: Patient's BP well controlled with Toprol XL and
dialysis. Added lisinopril 2.5mg to patient's regimine.
.
## Afib: Patient remained rate controlled throughout hospital
course. Anti-coagulation for Afib was held since patient with
active GI bleed in hospital.  Continued patient on BBlocker.

## CHF - Patient intially started on Coreg which was later
changed to Toprol XL 50mg. Patient with LVEF of 55%-60%. He most
likely has diastolic dysfunction.  Patient should avoid access
salt/volume administration. Continue dialysis to help remove
access fluid. Kept patient fluid restricted to 1500ml/day
.
## Leukocytosis/UTI - While in the ICU patient with elevated WBC
and hypothermic.  Cultures were sent which came back positive
for Proteus species in urine, sputum, and femoral line tip.
Patient was started on Ceftaz while in hospital, should complete
14 day course at rehab.
.
## RUE fistula - Patient right upper extremity continued to be
swollen.  A RUE U/S was done which was negative for clot. A
venogram was performed since patient had fistula and central
cath on right side to assess if patient has any stenosis.
Venogram did show stenosis and PTA was performed by IR which
improved swelling.  HOweve
