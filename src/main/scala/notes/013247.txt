Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 34 year old man with PMH of T1DM, diabetic
nephropathy, recurrent gastroparesis, and retinopathy presenting
with nausea and vomiting of sudden onset during HD at [**Hospital1 18**] this
morning. Pt began to feel nauseaous this morning during the car
ride to HD and vomited before the treatment began. While in HD,
Pt vomited and retched violently, which pulled the HD tubing out
of his AV fistula and led to an arterial bleed. This was
controlled with clamping and the patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
In the ED his initial VS were 98.6, 80, 238/117, 24, and 97%.
The patient reports nausea and vomiting over the last couple
days of abdominal pain he has a history of gastroparesis and
this feels similar to that.  He denied any fevers or abdominal
pain different from his previous episodes of gastroparesis.  He
did not have an elevated BS in ED, and his urine did not have
ketones.  He was given dilaudid, fluid, zofran and iv reglan to
help control his abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, but this
had little effect.  He was also given IV metoprolol since he
reported not being able to keep down his BP meds this morning.

He was sent back to the HD unit to finish his hemodialysis where
he had a BP in the 220's/120's.  Patient was given 2 inches of
nitro paste, 25 mg SL captopril.  He was also ordered for home
amlodipine and carvedilol, but he vomited these up.  BPs better
controlled to SBP 190s, but after a few minutes, rose back up to
220s.  Pt was continually somnolent, uncomfortable while on HD
unit.
.
Currently, the patient continues to be nauseous and is vomiting
green liquid.  He is complaining of abdominal pain and
requesting dilaudid.  He denies any chest pain, palpitations,
dyspnea, headache, visual changes, dizziness, somnolence.
.

changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness

Brief Hospital Course:
34 year old man with PMH of poorly controlled T1DM, diabetic
nephropathy, recurrent gastroparesis, and retinopathy presenting
with nausea and vomiting of sudden onset during HD treatment
accompanied by hypertension and abdominal pain.
.
#Nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain: Pt vomited multiple times
during his HD treatment and again in the ER. Infection felt to
be unlikely given that pt was afebrile w/o any localizing signs,
elevated WBC. Pt also does not have any ketones, ruling out DKA.
Most likely differential include gastroparesis vs uremia. Nausea
was controlled with zofran/ativan. WBCs trended without
elevation. Serial abdominal exams were benign. Pt also has
extreme abdominal pain from his gastroparesis with home regimen
of dilaudid for which he has a narcotics contract with his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 40902**] not ideal, since they are likely to be exacerbating
gastroparesis. Pain managed with pr tylenol, IV reglan.  Pt
complaints improved.  Pt also given pain clinic appt on
discharge.
.
#Hypertension: Pt has well-documented essential hypertension.
Patient has been hypertensive since he came to the hospital. His
BP has been ranging from 190-220 systolic over 100-120
diastolic. PO BP meds (carvedilol, nitropaste, and captopril)
have been ineffective in lowering his BP significantly during
HD. His normal BP is 160's-180's. 3L volume was removed in HD
the day of admission. It was felt that abdominal pain from n/v
was likely contributing to hypertension. Pt is allergic to
hydralazine. Sublingual captopril and Labetelol PRN was used
overnight to control BP to target of SBP 180s. Also, pain was
controlled with rectal tylenol, IV reglan.  Pt was eventually
restarted on all his home meds and SBP was in the 130-140s upon
discharge.  Minoxidil was considered however not started as BP
was well-controlled on current regimen.  Home Carvedilol was
changed to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] as that is the max dose.
.
#Diabetes: Pt's sugars were in the 200 range on day of
admission. Urine ketones negative so not in DKA. Normally his
sugars are in high 100's or 200's. Occasionally he's in the
100s. He recently saw [**Last Name (un) **] in [**9-19**] and they had continued his
lantus and SSI regimen. He's currently taking lantus 18 units in
the morning at home. They increased it from 15 over the last few
mo
