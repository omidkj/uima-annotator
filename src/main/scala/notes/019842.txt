Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Questionable insulinoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50390**] is a 67 yo female with history of morbid obesity,
atrial fibrillation on chronic coumadin, questionable DVT,
depression, history of OSA, asthma, hyopothyroidism presenting
from [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center for workup of possible
insulinoma.
Per reports, the patient is a resident at at [**Hospital1 **] [**Last Name (un) **]
Rehabiliation facility. She was found to have a fingerstick
glucose of 30 there and was transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] Mecial
Center for further evaluation. She was transferred to the ICU
for recurrent hypoglycemia and Cpeptide/insulin levels were
found to be elevated. Of note, the patient has no history of
diabetes. A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed which was
interpreted as "mild suppression of HPA axis", as cortisol went
from 10 - 19 with stim. The patient was started on 10 mg
prednisone, with glucose levels in the 100's afterwords.
Endocrinology was consulted, who was concerned for a possible
insulinoma. As patient is morbidly obese, she did not fit in the
CT scanner at the OSH, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for imaging.

Regarding her low blood sugars, the patient had been
expericening episodes of diaphresis and confusion assocaited
with sweats and visual changes since [**2108-9-9**]. Her BG was checked
and found to be hypoglycemic per above. She was given juice and
sugar cubes, but her sugars would temporally respond then dip to
the 30's-40's after an hours or so. She denies any recent
insulin use or oral hypoglcyemic use. Of note, she has been
trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, losing a total
of 50 lbs in the last year with 10 lbs in the last month.
Regarding the endocrionlogy consult, she had a cosyntropin test
per above which suggested adrenal suppression possibly from
chronic inhaled steroid use, and increased levothyroxine dosing
leading to HPA suppression. This led to a recommendation of
lifelong prednisone use which started at 10 mg daily. She was
further evaluated on [**9-15**] where insulin concentration was 114,
proinsulin was 53, and C-peptide was 14.6 all c/w insulin
hypersecrtion from insulinoma or receiving a secreatgogue such
as a sulfonylurea. Given that the patient did not have any
further episodes of hypoglycemia, endocrinology was under the
impression that hypoglycemic episode related to sulfonylurea
ingestion. Suggested CT abdomen as well as tapering of
prednisone 1mg per week to goal of [**4-7**] mg daily.
At the OSH, a left sided PICC was placed given poor access. A
portable CXR performed that showed "complete opacity of the left
hemithorax with increasing infiltrate at the right lung base and
gastric congestion in the right lung". Regarding placement, the
left PICC line position was difficult to ascertain due to
distorted anatomy from "left lung collapse" with concern for
placement in the left innominate vein. INR around that time was
5.0, and the patient claism to continue to have oozing from the
site since placement on [**2108-9-16**].
At time of transfer, the patient's T was 97.8, pulse 88, RR 20
saturating 95% on no documented O2 supplemnetation with BP of
137/62.
.

ROS: Endorsed visual changes involving central clouding and
peripheral acuity. Resolved after the hospital "gave her some
meds". Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, rhinorrhea,
congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

# HYPOXIA/LOBAR LUNG COLLAPSE: Patient is in chronic respiratory
acidosis due to small airways collapse and air trapping.  She
was found to have complete left upper lobe and partial lower
lobe collapse on CT scan after admission.  Echo performed to
evaluate for pulmonary hypertension was suboptimal given
patient's habitus. Most likely cause for O2 requirement is a mix
of obstructive airway disease with Pickwickian physiology. She
experienced respiratory decompensation with hypercarbia and was
transferred to the MICU where she was intubated for respiratory
failure.  Bronchoscopy showed collapse of left large airways due
to extrinsic compression by right atrium and secretions in right
lung.  Serial CXRs showed an evolving right sided pneumonia.
She completed an 8 day course of vancomycin and aztreonam for
pneumonia.  Due to the patient's body habitus and obstruction,
she required a large amount of PEEP on the ventilator.  She
underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage which was unrevealing.  Due
to poor ability to wean from the ventilator, the patient
underwent tracheostomy.  She was weaned to intermittent trach
mask with periods of rest on MMV, and required CPAP/PSV
overnight for transient episodes of desaturation at night.
.
# SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Persistently elevated INR (5.0) after
admission despite holding Coumadin. Likely related to
malnutrition/malabsorption as opposed to liver dysfunction or
medication effect in this patient. She received a dose of PO
vitamin K prior to MICU transfer.  In the MICU, INR improved.
It remained stable for the remained of admission.
.
# HYPOGLYCEMIC EPISODES AT OSH: OSH endocrine workup concerning
for insulinoma vs. adrenal insufficiency vs. medication effect
due to inappropriate insulin/secretagogue. Other potential
causes ruled out here. She was followed by endocrine here and
had no further episodes of hypoglycemia.  Endocrine was not
concerned for insulinoma.  The patient would benefit from
endocrine follow-up, and was instructed to do so on discharge.
.
# ?ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Abnormal cosyntropin stim test at OSH
although sub-optimal study. ABD CT shows ?1.5cm adrenal nodule,
left. Her repeat cortisol stimulation testing here off of
steroids was normal suggesting that she does not actually have
adrenal insufficiency.
.
# PROTEUS UTI: She had a positive UA with urine culture growing
Proteus.  Given her allergies, she was started on aztreonam for
treatment.  UTI proven aztreonam sensitive.  She completed an 8
day course of antibiotics.  UTI resolved.
.
# ASTHMA:  The patient was continued on nebs and inhalers
throughout admission.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Chronic.  Patient's coumadin was held on
admission for supratherapeutic INR.  Coumadin was restarted and
she remained therapeutic for the remained for admission.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Patient was continued on home dose
levothyroxine 200 mcg qday.
.
# OBESITY: Morbidly obese.  Has had pannus resection in past.
She was followed by wound care for pannus [**Female First Name (un) **].  She was
treated with nystatin and cream.
.
# DEPRESSION: She was continued on Ce
