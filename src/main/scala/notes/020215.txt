Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
Shoulder pressure/ ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the left
anterior coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
65-year-old female smoker with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and a remote history of breast cancer presents
as a code STEMI.
.
Patient was in her normal state of health until this morning
when she began to feel a heaviness on her shoulders bilaterally.
She proceded to take her husband to the [**Company 3596**], shower, became
nauseaus, dry heaved in the bathroom, and lay down, feeling
diaphoretic. She then felt cramping in her legs, which she
described as a vice [**2137-3-21**] intensity, which she occasionally
gets at rest and is able to walk out. At that point, 90 minutes
into the shoulder heaviness, which was not abating, she called
911 and was diagnosed in the ambulance with an NSTEMI.
.
Patient arrived in the ED at 11:20, taken to the cath lab, and
had her balloon deployed at 12:17.
.
Incidentally, patient had not been hungry the evening prior to
this event and only had coffee during the morning.
.
Patient has never had the feeling of shoulder heaviness prior to
this event, even with activity, but she admits to not being very
active at baseline. As mentioned, she occasionally has thigh
cramping at night when she is lying down, which she is able
relieve by walking. The pain never happens with walking itself.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis,
change in bowel habbits. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.

Cath Report: [**2138-6-3**]
Not Final:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography revealed a normal Left main, patent,
non-dominant LCx giving rise to a small OM, an RCA with minor
plaquing,
and a proximally occluded LAD after the D1 take-off.
2. Successful PCI of the occluded proximal LAD, using a Promus
2.5 x 15
mm DES which was post-dilated using a 3.0 x 12 mm balloon.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  vessel.
3. Successful PCI of proximally occluded LAD.
4. Continue with Aspirin indefinitely and Clopidogrel for at
least 1
year.

EKG [**2138-6-3**]:
Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact with somatic tremor. QS
deflections in
leads V1-V3 with ST segment elevation of acute myocardial
ischemia and/or
myocardial infarction compared to the previous tracing of
[**2132-2-13**].

ECHO [**2138-6-4**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild-moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the apex, mid-distal anterior septum, and anterior wall. The
remaining segments are hyperdynamic (LVEF = 40-45 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure
