Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent placement.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old female with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and achalasia who presents with an episode of right sided chest
pain.  The patient reports that over the past week she has been
experiencing upper respiratory type symptoms including
rhinorrhea, sore throat and mild cough.  Her daughter had
similar symptoms.  She was prescribed azithromycin for a five
day course over the phone but did not see a doctor or have a
chest xray.  She is currently on her last day of antibiotics and
says that these original symptoms have resolved.  She now
presents with an episode of right sided chest pain.  She
describes the pain as sharp and well localized beneath her right
breast.  It is worsened with deep inspiration.  It was not
improved by SL nitroglycerine.  It does not feel like her
typical anginal pain which occurs consistently with exertion and
which she describes a pressure across her chest associated with
shortness of breath.  She says that this new pain is very
similar to that which she had on the left side two months ago
when she was diagnosed with a left sided pneumonia at [**Hospital1 1774**].
The patient recently presented to her outpatient cardiologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with worsening anginal symptoms.  She says that she
experienced angina prior to her CABG seven years ago.  She did
not experience any symptoms until approximatley two months ago
when she started experiencing her anginal symptoms with
increasing frequency and severity.  She now experiences chest
pain and dyspnea with minimal exertion.  She was scheduled for
elective cardiac catheterization to occur [**2162-1-6**].
.
In the emergency room her vitals were T: 97.8, HR 54, BP:
124/44, RR: 18, O2: 93% on RA.  She received aspirin 81 mg,
sublingual nitroglycerin, a second 325 mg aspirin,
n-acetylcystein 600 mg PO x 1 and was started on a heparin and
nitroglycerin drips.  She has a CXR which appears to have
evidence of congestion but no clear infiltrates.  She had an EKG
which showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and a LBBB.  Per
the patient's daughter the left bundle branch block is old
although this is not documented in our system.  She had cardiac
enzymes which were positive at Troponin 0.72.  She was found to
have a creatinine of 1.9 which is up from her last recorded
value in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year of 1.2.  She had an elevated D-dimer
at 4040.  She did not receive a PE-CT scan given her elevated
creatinine.
.
On review of systems she currently denies lightheadedness,
dizziness, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dysuria,
hematuria, decreased urine output, leg pain or swelling. She
does have chronic back and joint pain.  She has neuropathy in
her arms which is chronic.  She has right sided chest pain as
described above.  She does not have any left sided chest
pressure at current.

No illict drug use.  Retired banker.  Livers with her son and
her grandaughter.

age of 38,
another son has known coronary artery disease and is doing well.

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate of 53, normal axis, LBBB.
.
Imaging:
CXR PA and Lateral [**2162-1-2**]:
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Median sternotomy wires are
seen. There is again seen areas of focal consolidation within
the right upper lobe, right perihilar region, and left lower
lobe. These findings are more apparent than the prior study and
suspicious for infectious/inflammatory etiology.
.
Renal Ultrasound:
The right kidney measures 12.9 cm. The left kidney measures 11.6
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones or masses.
Note is made of a questionable duplex left kidney as noted by a
possible column of cortex extending across the mid-to-upper
pole. The urinary bladder is not visualized and likely empty.
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral,
superficial, and popliteal veins were performed. Normal
compressibility, augmentation, flow and waveforms were
demonstrated. There is no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
.
CTA OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or
aortic dissection. The bronchi are patent to the subsegmental
level, though there is significant tracheomalacia. In the
tracheo-esophageal space, there is soft tissue thickening,
likely lymphadenopathy. There are multiple areas of
consolidation throughout all lobes of the lungs, predominantly
in the superior portion of the left lower lobe and apical
portion of the right upper lobe. Smaller foci of consolidation
are seen within the right middle lobe and lingula. There is a
moderate-sized right pleural effusion, layering dependently,
measuring simple fluid density. There is also a smaller left-
sided pleural effusion layering dependently and extending into
the major fissure, also measuring simple fluid density. A
punctate calcification is noted at the left lung base, likely a
granuloma.
A prominent prevascular lymph node is noted anterior to the
aortic arch measuring 9 mm in short axis. There are other small
mediastinal lymph nodes including a 7-mm left prevascular lymph
node, 6-mm precarinal lymph node, and a prominent subcarinal
lymph node which is not easily distinguished from the esophagus.
Probable hiatal hernia, incompletely visualized, is noted. There
are dense calcifications within the native coronary arteries,
particularly the LAD and its branches. Aortic valve
calcifications are noted. There is no pericardial effusion. The
heart is moderately enlarged. Median sternotomy wires and CABG
clips are noted.
