History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1263**] is a 75 y/o female with PMH significant for
COPD/asthma, CHF ([**5-12**] EF 38%, at [**Hospital1 18**] <20%), HTN, Afib, CRI
(baseline Cr 1.1), and seizure d/o, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**8-17**] for
resp distress thought [**2-10**] COPD failure and CHF,also with
worsening renal function; transferred to CCU for PA cath
placement for tailored therapy.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**8-17**] for worsening SOB, elevated K,
treated with nebulizer tx, IV lasix 40mg X 2, diltiazem drip,
methylprednisolone, Ca Gluc/insulin/kayexelate.  Echo at [**Hospital1 18**]
revealed 3+MR, TR, EF25-30%. Of note, echo at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**6-12**] with EF
of 38%.
.
Patient was most recently hospitalized in [**6-12**] for hypercarbic
resp failure ([**Hospital1 2025**] MICU) [**2168-5-20**] and [**Hospital 13692**] rehab--home [**2168-6-16**]
on 7d course of Levaquin.  Pt's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], most
recently treated pt with course of Augmentin.  Per pt, she has
been doing well at home until 2d PTA when she developed
increasing oxygen requirement at home (2L to 3L) and worsening
SOB (Daughter states that pt, at baseline, is on home oxygen of
2 L and BiPap 15/5 for 1-2 hours at night and uses mask nebs
approximately q4hrs).  Pt saw PCP [**8-15**] and found to have elevated
potassium, and worsening bilateral leg edema with weeping
bilaterally.  She was referred to the ED for further evaluation.
 Pt reports baseline 3 pillow orthopnea, no PND, denies
CP/palpitations/SOB/N/V/diaphoresis/LH.  Appetite has been good
until 3days PTA.  Regular bowel movements/bladder habits.  Pt
reports she ambulates without assistance at baseline, and is
able to climb 3 floors of stairs in her house without diffculty.

[**2168-9-5**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small pocket of extraluminal air along the anterior surface
of the

[**2168-9-12**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged pocket of extraluminal air along the anterior
surface of the transverse colon with interval resolution of the
inflammatory stranding surrounding this pocket, consistent with
a small walled off perforated diverticula.
2. Small amount of intraabdominal ascites, unchanged.
3. Slight interval increase in the small bilateral pleural
effusions with interval increase in the left lower lung lobe
compressive atelectasis.

CONCLUSION:
1. Interval resolution of the abdominal air, in the left
anterior mid abdomen. The transverse colon diverticulum visible
in that location with minimal rim enhancement but no pericolic
collection.

regression.

Brief Hospital Course:
In CCU [**Date range (1) 13693**] poor response to Lasix, worsened respiratory
failure required intubation [**8-21**]. On [**8-21**] PA placed with
markedly elevated wedge, PA pressures.  Levophed started as pt
hypotensive in setting of initiating propofol. Ultimate plan to
initiate inotropic agents.  Worsening renal failure thought [**2-10**]
poor forward flow in CHF.  Pt markedly worsening over [**8-21**]
morning, as with recent prolonged hospitalizarion, started on
Vanco, Aztreonan (has pen allergy) for possible pneumonia.
.
75 y/o female with past medical history significant for
recurrent COPD/asthma exacerbations on home oxygen and bipap at
night and CHF who presents to us with SOB now intubated, with
Aflutter despite DC cardioversion, proc gtt and IV diltiazem,
now switched to po diltiazem for rate control, now diuresing for
optimization of pulmonary status given CHF for ablation which
will occur hopefully in the coming days.
.
1.  RESPIRATORY:
The pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for managent of the SOB. The pt
initially responded to nebulizers, steroids, abx, oxygen. After
the pt developed A-fib, the pt was transferred to the CCU for
help with rate control, which was resistant to the dilt.
The pt's respiratory status deterioriated and she devloped
hypoxemia requiring intubation on [**8-19**]. The bicarb prior to
intubation was 33 indicating the pt had a chronic respiratory
acidosis. The pt was weaned from vent [**2168-8-24**], was doing well on
Bipap with alternating NC (3L), but then on [**8-31**], was moving
from chair to bed, and became acutely SOB, desatted to 70s. Put
on BIPAP.  Sats in 80s for 20min. Paged Anesthesia and pt was
intubated. ABG showed 7.35/81/42, IV solumedrol was given.  Pt's
sats improved on mechanical ventilation, on AC now. The pt
remained on the vent while she was being diuresed. PSV trials
were done, with the pt breathing well. The pt failed a couple of
attempts at extubation. The decision for trach was discussed
with the pt and with the family.
   A trach was placed by interventional pulmonology since the pt
has had several previous intubations and was now having a
prolonged ventilator requirement. The pt remained vented on the
trach.  Several attempts were made to wean from the vent but due
to a combination of anxiety and oxygen requirement, the patient
remains on the vent at time of discharge.
.
2. Bowel Perforation:
The pt was noted to have abdomenal tenderness on [**9-5**]. CT scan
noted a contained perforation of the transverse colon with
extraluminal air. The pt remained hemodynamically stable, with
no signs of sepsis. Su
