Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
epistaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nose pack to left nosstril


History of Present Illness:
78yo woman with afib on warfarin, CHF EF 25% presented with
spontaneous epistaxis to OSH, drop in Hct from 41 to 33. Patient
reports spontaneous bleeding from the left nostril on [**5-10**] at
4AM, continuing all day before presenting to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
On presentation to OSH ED her Hct was 41.3, INR was 3.56. INR
held and trended down to 2.48, Hct to 33. Left nostril was
packed with anterior left rhinoket. She has also been having
bleeding from the eye, and hematemesis and melena. However, she
was noted to still be "oozing" posteriorly. Over the course of
her hospitalization patient was noted to have a Hct drop from
41.3 on admission to 33, now to 27, but had not had any
transfusions to date. Patient has remained hemodynamically
stable with normal renal function. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] per
family request. She was initially admitted to the floor. She was
noted to have hematemesis and black stools. She was transferred
on the evening of admission to the ICU for falling Hct.
In the MICU, she was transfused one unit pRBCs and was
hemodynamically stable.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI , dyspnea on exertion, stable. She has had only one
prior nose bleed on several years ago managed conservatively at
home.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.

Social History:

daughter. She smoked tobacco and quit 21 years ago. She drinks
EtOH rarely.


Family History:

Father died of congestive heart failure at age 78. Mother died
from congestive heart failure and had benign brain tumors.

STUDIES:

Cardiovascular Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2199-5-12**]  5:52:48 PM
Baseline artifact. Probable atrial fibrillation with short cycle
length
and long cycle length different morphology beats. The long cycle
length
is a ventricular paced beat. The short is either ventricular or
aberration.
Conducted complexes have low limb lead voltage, leftward axis
and
intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block
type. Since the
previous tracing of [**2199-2-25**] atrial fibrillation appears to be
new. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

Radiology Report	CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2199-5-12**] 9:11
AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2197-2-24**], the previous
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is no longer seen. There
are mild areas of increased opacification at the bases, most
likely reflecting atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical
setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to
be considered. No evidence of vascular congestion. Dual-channel
pacemaker device remains in place.
