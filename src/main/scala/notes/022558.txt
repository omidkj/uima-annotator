Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
Coffee ground emesis + tarry ostomy output x 1 day

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Nasogastric tube insertion x3
- EGD w/ suction to remove ~2.5 L


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4702**] is an 88 year-old woman from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with a past
history of hypertension, colon cancer post-resection/ileostomy,
coronary artery disease post-stenting ([**July 2185**]) and previous GI
bleeding ([**2185**]) that presented to the ED with a history of two
episodes of coffee-ground emesis at her nursing home and general
lethargy for the past 1-2 days; she had her first emesis on
[**7-31**] during her breakfast, and so was changed to a clear liquid
diet. This vomitting then subsided on [**8-1**]; however, on the
morning of [**8-2**], she had her first bout of coffee ground emesis
despite the minimal PO intake and was found to have developed
melena in her ostomy bag. She later had another episode of
coffee ground emesis, and was therefore transferred to the ED.
After initial management in the ED, she was transferred to the
ICU for management of her renal failure and observation of her
hemodynamic status.
.
In the emergency department at [**Hospital1 18**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] initial vital
signs were: T:97.7 HR:86 BP:96/72 RR:16 O2 Sat:99%. She was
hemodynamically stable, with a hematocrit of 39, which is her
baseline. Of note, she was found to have melena that was guaiac
positive in her ileostomy bag, which was leaking. She refused
the placement of a nasogastric tube, but was typed and crossed
for 2 units of blood and given 80 mg IV protonix bolus followed
by 8 mg protonix IV/hr gtt. An ECG was performed that showed no
changes from previous ECGs. One 18 and one 20 gauge cannula was
inserted for access. GI was consulted and noted her hemodynamic
stability and refusal of placement of a nasogastric tube. In
addition, they stated that the patient would need an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) under monitored anesthesia care
(MAC) given her CAD and ARF.
.
On the floor, her vital signs were T: 97.2, HR: 91, BP: 112/49,
RR: 21. A new ileostomy bag was fitted and she was again seen by
GI, who repeated the above recommendations. She continued to
suffer from nausea and vomitted low volumes of liquid several
times which was blood-streaked and bilious.

Of note, per nursing home staff, baseline mental status is
stable confusion, but oriented x3. Per her nephew, the patient
has been having progressively worsening confusion and decreased
attentiveness over the past several months, and has also been
experiencing falls with increasing frequency (~[**1-22**]/month).

Pertinent Results:
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2186-8-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggesting small bowel obstruction with a transition
in caliber
of mid to distal small bowel in the mid pelvis. There is
potentially some
enteric contrast passing through, however, so the obstruction
may be partial.
2. Large midline abdominal hernia containing portions of the
stomach and the
small bowel, but no obstruction noted inside the hernia.
3. Left lower lobe consolidation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2186-8-5**]
There is diffuse opacification in almost the entire left lung
and some opacification in the right lower lung. None of these
were present on the previous chest x-ray of [**8-5**]. These
could represent diffuse aspiration
pneumonia.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2186-8-8**]
Again seen is a diffuse left lung opacities which is unchanged
since [**2186-8-5**]. This could represent combination of diffuse aspiration and
pleural
effusion. On the right side there is mild effusion with
atelectasis of
adjacent lung is new since [**2186-8-5**] Right upper lung is
clear.
Mediastinum could not be evaluated due to left lung opacities
obscuring the
margins on left side.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW	Study Date of [**2186-8-9**]
FINDINGS: Penetration and likely silent aspiration was observed
with thin
barium. For further details, please refer to the speech and
swallow division note in online medical record.
IMPRESSION: Penetration and likely silent aspiration with thin
barium.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, pureed consistency barium, [**1-22**] of one cookie coated with
barium and one barium pill were administered. Results follow:

ORAL PHASE:
Bolus formation, bolus control, base of tongue retraction, and
mastication were mildly impaired. Oral transit was timely. Mild
oral cavity residue was noted on the tongue with liquids,
mild-moderate with solid. Residue cleared with f/u sips of
liquid. Premature spillover was noted with thin and nectar-thick
liquids to the valleculae and intermittently to the pyriform
sinuses.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
Swallow initiation was intermittently mildly delayed most
frequently with nectar-thick liquids. Velar elevation,
epiglottic
deflection, bolus propulsion, and UES relaxation were WFL.
Laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure were mildly
impaired, and valve closure was frequently slow. No residue was
noted in the pharynx.

ESOPHAGEAL SCREENING:
The barium table passed freely through the pharynx. However, it
was noted to remain in the mid-esophagus and did not clear with
sips of thin liquid or bites of puree.

ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR POSITION:
Not performed due to pt positioning.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
Penetration occurred before the height of the swallow with thin
liquid due to slow laryngeal valve closure. Penetration did not
completely clear spontaneously, over 90% cleared with cued
throat
clear. Pt did have spontaneous throat clear intermittently in
response to penetration. Unable to fully visualize the airway
due
to pt positioning; however, given trace amounts of uncle[**Name (NI) **]
penetration noted, pt is at risk for intermittent trace
aspiration.

TREATMENT TECHNIQUES:
Cue to take small sip with cup rather than straw was effective
for preventing penetration.

SUMMARY:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4702**] presented with a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia as
characterized above. She is at risk for intermittent trace
aspiration with thin liquids, but risk is significantly reduced
with aspiration precautions listed below. Recommend PO diet of
thin liquids and soft solids with strict aspiration p
