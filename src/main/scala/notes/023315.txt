Brief Hospital Course:
79 y/o Russian speaking man with dementia and h/o aspiration PNA
s/p PEG placement, who presents from his NH with fever to 103,
lethargy, and increased secretions.
.
# FEVER:
Blood culture ([**7-8**]) [**1-20**] positive for klebsiella and proteus
sensitive to Zosyn.  He was treated for 3 days and will finish
the 14 day IV Zosyn course at rehab.  A PICC in his right arm
has been placed.  His follow up blood cultures are all negative
although they are just preliminary results.
.
He also grew >100,000 colonies of organisms.  He was treated
with Fluconazole 100mg PO x 1.
.
He could not produce an adequate sputum sample.  CXR was
equivocal for PNA/aspiration PNA.
.
He was afebrile with no leukocytosis as time of discharge.
.
# SECRETIONS:
He has secretions but they never compromised his oxygenation.
His saturations are 95% on room air at time of discharge.  Wall
suction was used for secretions but he rarely needed this.
Scopolamine patch was continued with good effect.
.
# HTN:
Antihypertensives were held at the MICU s/p his episode of
hypotension (responded to fluid bolus).  He was stablized and
when he reached the medical floors, metoprolol and nitro patch
was restarted.  His SBP stayed between 110-130.  Lisinopril was
held.  Please consult with PCP whether he should restart
Lisinopril.
.
# P-AFib:
Not on anticoagulation due to fall risk but was in NSR.  He
receieved metoprolol.
.
# DIASTOLIC CHF:
Pt with a h/o CHF in the setting of nml EF; suggestive of
diastolic dysfunction.  He had crackles on lung exam, but he
never complained of shortness of breath.  His saturations
remained over 95% at all times.  He did not get IV fluids and
was making urine.  He was never given diuretics, but his BNP
upon discharge was [**2064**].  He should follow up with PCP to
discuss whether he should be on diuretics.

# GROSS HEMATURIA:
Resolved.  Secondary to foley trauma.
.
# FUNGAL RASH:
On back and and buttock and L antecubitus area.  Miconazole
cream was given.
.
# s/p fall out of bed ([**7-11**]):
No signs of injuries.  Denied CP/SOB.  Question of whether he
hit his head.  CT head final read: no hemorrhage.
.
# ANEMIA:
Probably a component of dilutional anemia and his hct remained
stable.  MVC 95.  No obvious source of bleed, no reason for
hemolysis.  Guiaic stools negative.
.
# FEN:
NPO due to aspiration risk
TFs, probalance at goal of 85cc/hr.
.
# Access
2 PIV and PICC on right arm.
.
# PPx
Hep SQ, H2 blocker [**Hospital1 **], pneumoboots, bowel regimen
Aspiration precaution, fall precaution
