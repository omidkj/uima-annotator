Chief Complaint:
hematemesis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
70 year old woman with hx of multipe comorbidities,
HTN/TIA/COPD, s/p right upper lobectomy for lung cancer, and a
remote hx of sb and large bowel resection (18 cm) for unknown
parastic infection, was transferred from OSH where she had
presented with 2-3 d hx of nausea/vomiting and one day hx of
abdominal pain and developed an episode of hematemesis at the
OSH. Pt reports that 3 days of intermittent nausea/vomiting with
increasing abdominal pain over middle quadrants since 1:00AM
last night. She reports she has had 3 years of intermittent
nausea and vomiting and had a recent viral gastroenteritis with
diarrhea 1 week ago. At the OSH an abdominal CT scan was done
that was suspicious for partial SBO given mild dilation of the
duodenum and then subsequent decompression after the second
portion and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In ED, initial VS were 97.5, 120, 135/60, 20, 92%RA. An NG
lavage was performed that revealed black material that was not
clearing despite 1 liter of lavage. The patient did not have
another episode of frank hematemesis. Her serum alcohol level
was found to be high (127) in the ED.
.
On the floor, initial vitals were T: 98.6 BP: 160/83 P: 117 R:
27 O2: 94% 3L NC. The Pt was uncomfortable but in no acute
distress, and her exam was notable for epigastric abdominal
tenderness with minimal guarding and no rebound tenderness. GI
was consulted and planned to perform EGD on the Pt shortly after
arrival to the MICU.

[**3-15**]: GI bx
Esophagus, mucosal biopsy: Ulcerated squamous mucosa with
fibrino-purulent exudate.  Stains for bacteria and fungi are
negative.
.
[**3-15**] CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Circumferential mural edema involving the distal esophagus as
well as the gastric pylorus more than antrum, suggesting
esophagitis and gastritis, which may be inflammatory in
etiology. Further evaluation by upper endoscopy is recommended.
2. No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Diffuse
atherosclerotic disease with calcification involving much of the
abdominal aorta and the origin of the SMA and celiac arteries
with mild narrowing.
3. Fatty liver. Small hypodensities within bilateral kidneys,
too small to characterize.
4. A sebaceous cyst within the right back appears unchanged.
5. Diffuse hepatosteatosis without focal lesion. No evidence of
small-bowel obstruction.
6. Small right pleural effusion.
.
[**3-18**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70 year old woman with COPD, history of lung CA s/p
RUL lobectomy, possible ETOH abuse, presenting with hematemesis
and abdominal pain, found to have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
.
#. Hematemesis.  An EGD was performed which showed exudative
esophagitis, gastritis, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  The
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear was likely from vomiting as a result of
concomitant NSAID and EtOH use with a blood alchohol level of
around 300 at OSH prior to transfer.  Biopsies showed ulcerated
squamous mucosa with fibrino-purulent exudate and stains were
negative for bacteria/fungus.  An active type and screen as well
as access with 2 large bore IVs was maintained.  She was
initiated on Protonix 40mg IV BID which was transitioned to
Protonix 40mg PO BID prior to discharge.  Her hematocrit was
trended frequently but remained stable and she did not require a
blood transfusion.  Her home aspirin was also held and a
decision to restart it was deferred to the outpatient setting.
.
#. Hypoxemia.  She had a significant 5-6L O2 requirement, but
was weaned to 88-92% on RA [**3-17**].  She was satting in the low 90s
on RA both at rest and on exertion prior to discharge which is
felt to be her baseline.  She does have a baseline RUL lobectomy
plus COPD but does not have a home O2 requirement.  Her CXR had
effusions and possible edema likely from volume overload after
resusciation with possible diastolic dysfunction.  Her JVD was
not elevated and she did not appearing grossly volume
overloaded, but her sats improved dramatically after several
doses of Lasix 10mg IV.  She was started on Lasix 20 mg PO daily
on discharge.  She was transitioned to albuterol/ipratropium
nebs in addition to her home Flovent for COPD management.  The
nebs were changed back to her home regimen of albuterol inhaler
and tiotropium prior to discharge.  Her home theophylline was
also initially discontinued due to tachycardia but was restarted
on [**3-17**] as her blood levels were WNLs.
.
# Tachycardia:  The patient was tachycardic to the 120s on
arrival to the MICU.  She has a history of tachycardia based on
PCP clinical notes which is thought to be secondary to her
theophylline and bronchodilators.  She had no other signs of
alcohol withdrawal.  She was bolused 1L NS on arrival given
hematemesis and her heart rate came down to low 100s.  TSH was
ordered and within normal limits at 2.7. There was some concern
for pulmonary embolism and an ECHO was obtained prior to
discharge which did not show signs of right heart strain.  She
was monitored on telemetry without significant cardiac events.
.
#. ETOH abuse: She admits to drinking 2 shots of scotch nightly
and was noted to have an ETOH level in the 300s at the OSH and
was measured at 127 on admission here.  She has evidence of
fatty liver disease, and hx of elevated
