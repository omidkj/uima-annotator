Chief Complaint:
DKA, ICU admission as on insulin drip

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
He is a 28 yo male with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2
with DM1 and Addison??????s syndrome.  He presented to our ED after
recent hospitalization at [**Location (un) 8973**] Hospital where he underwent
a cardiac cath on [**1-13**] for a report of a positive stress test.
The catheterization report (that we obtained on [**1-19**]) was
without any blockage(s) or valvular abnormalities.  He was
discharged
to home from [**Location (un) 8973**].

He was then admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-31**] and per the
discharge
summary at that time had significant gastroparesis and
abdominal discomfort.  Per the discharge summary he became
upset when he was not allowed off the floor to smoke and signed
out AMA;  there was no mention of LE weakness or numbness, no
report of trauma.  The patient gave a very different account of
these events.  He returned less than 24 hours later with a
complaint of bilateral lower extremity numbness and weakness.

In the ED patient was given IVF and insulin gtt. for glucose of
332 and A-gap of 13. Central line was placed. His CK was 2429
with flat Trop. He had CT spine done w/o signs of acute fracture
or cord compression. He was seen by neurology.
His vital signs remained stable with T 97.1 BP 136/90 HR 100
O2Sat100%RA

CT ABDOMEN W&W/O C & RECONS: Unremarkable abdominal CT.
.
CT CHEST: 1. No evidence of aortic dissection. 2. Prominent
thymus may be related to known polyglandular autoimmune
syndrome; however, neoplastic etiologies such as thymoma are
possible. MRI can be obtained for further evaluation if
clinically indicated.
.
MR C, T, L-SPINE W& W/O CONTRAST: No findings to account for the
patient's symptoms. Specifically, there is no imaging evidence
for cord infarct, cord contusion or epidural hematoma.
.
CT T, L-SPINE: 1. No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
 2. No change in appearance of mild anterior wedge-shaped
abnormality at T12 vertebral body.


Brief Hospital Course:
28 yo male with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2 with
DM1 and addison??????s syndrome s/p cath p/w called out from MICU
after DKA and lower extremity pain/numbness.
.
# MICU COURSE: Patient was started on insulin drip and given IV
hydration. He was given volume resuscitation until gap closed
then insulin ggt and D5W. Blood sugar was difficult to control
initially taken off insulin drip on [**1-16**] once gap closed and
resumed for high sugars. Patient was started on glargine with
good control of blood sugars. He was seen neurology and
neurosurgery. Surgery was consultd for possible removal of
broken insulin needle in abdominal wall. On further evaluation,
there was no needle.  He had an MRI with no evidence of cord
compression.
.
# Diabetes/ketoacidosis. Patient with DM1 [**12-29**] PGA type 2. His
DNA has resolved. Patient takes home regimen of NPH 35 QAM and
15u at lunch and 10 QHS. He was hyperglycemic on glargine 15U.
He was seen and evaluated by [**Last Name (un) **] consult. He had been seen
there as an outpatient sveral years ago, but is no longer
followed since he is no longer a pediatric patient. He was
started on glarging 26 U nightly. He should follow up with his
PCP or [**Name9 (PRE) **] for further management.
.
# Lower extremity pain/numbness/urinary retention: His symptoms
resolved without intervention. Patient ambulated with PT with
minimal pain. No evidence of cord compression on MRI.  History
of symptoms following cath is concerning for embolic phenomenon,
however no evidence of infarction on MRI.  Urinary retention
resolved following restarting home anti bladder spasm
medication.  As his symptoms improved markedly during his
hospitalization, neurology did not feel further imaging was
necessary.  He was able to ambulate without dificulty and was
cleared by PT.  He was given a cane for comfort.
- He will follow up with neurology reagarding his symptoms and
given high protein in CSF
.
# Chest pain: Patient had atypical chest pain on [**1-19**] that came
on at rest and resolved spontaneously. An EKG was unchanged and
cardiac enzymes were normal. He has had a cardiac
catheterization in the past week with normal coronary arteries.
Most likely cause is atelectasis or esophagitis.  He was given
reassurance and continued on his PPI.
.
# CK Elevation: Patient had a CK elevation on admission with
normal CK-MB. This elevation improved with hydration and was
likley related to recent trauma. Also could be related to
autoimmune or viral myositis. If this problem returned and he
was symptomatic, could consider muscle biopsy.
.
# PGA type 2- Addisons: continue outpatient hydrocortisone and
florinef. Hemodynamically stable and no signs of crisis. He was
given additional dose of hydrocort in stress setting. He was
discharged on his home dose.
.
# Thymus abnormality on CT scan: Per report, "Prominent thymus
may be related to known polyglandular autoimmune syndrome;
however, neoplastic etiologies such as thy
