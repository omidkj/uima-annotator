Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 yo f with pmh of stage iv renal cell ca, also
s/p recent colonic perforation with igmoid colectomy/Low
anterior resection with end colostomy and Hartmann's procedure,
who comes in with hypercarbic respiratory acidosis. She had a
recent admission for debulking nephrectomy for her RCC however,
it was never performed as she developed gram negative bacteremia
(B fragilis in [**12-5**] bottles) and subsequent bowel perforation.
Pt was treated broadly initially, then abx were tailored to
Levofloxacin, flagyl, and fluconazole. She was taken to the OR
for sigmoid colectomy/LAR with end colostomy and Hartmann's
procedure and jejunal feeding tube placement and then discharged
to [**Hospital **] rehab facility. For the past few days patient was
noted to be more hypoxic- and was treated with nebs and
prednisone. Finally today was sent into the ED for worsening
respiratory status.
.
In ED, VS were: p96.6, p105, 140/40, rr40, 87% 6L nc, 100% NRB.
Pt was found to have a increased pleural effusion (L>R), LLL
opacity. Lasix given without any improvement in respiratory
status. Pt was noted to be in severe respiratory distress with
RR in 50s ABG was found to be 7.21/104/200. Pt was urgently
intubated. Started on propofol drip, maintained good blood
pressures. Given cefepime, vanco, flagyl, lasix 20mg IV,
etomidate, succinylcholine, fentanyl, versed.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course #1:
.
The patient was admitted to the MICU service for close
monitoring and ventilatory support.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Thought to be multifactorial,
including pneumonia, CHF, and COPD exacerbation. The patient was
treated with cefipime and vancomycin for a CAP vs nosocomial
PNA. Solumedrol was given for COPD, as well as
albuterol/atrovent nebs. The patient was diuresed with lasix. A
thoracentesis was performed on HD2 for the large R pleural
effusion, with removal of approximately 700cc fluid which was
consistent with a transudate, and negative for malignant cells.
The patient remained intubated with RSBI scores around 150
suggesting she was a poor candidate for extubation, although
attempts were made to optimize the chances for her success by
diuresis and controlling her heart rate and blood pressure,
initially with labetalol gtt then PO labetalol. The patient
eventually did well with improved mechanics and was extubated on
[**2164-1-21**] and has since maintained her SaO2 on 4 L NC.
.
# Recent colonic perforation. Not an acute issue during this
hospitalization. Normal stool output through colostomy.
.
# RCC. Stage IV. Was scheduled for debulking surgery during
previous admission which did not occur [**12-22**] colonic perforation.
.
# Leukocytosis. Tests for c diff sent which were positive and
started Flagyl for treatment.
.
# Peripheral edema. Thought to be due to hypoalbuminemia.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities was negative for DVT. She
was diuresed.
.
# HTN. The patient's blood pressure was initially difficult to
control, requiring a labetalol gtt which was eventually
transitioned to PO.  However, after PEA arrest, her blood
pressure has been low, so discontinued all antihypertensives.
.
# FEN. Tube feedings through J-tube.
.
*****************
MICU Course #2
.
The patient was re-admitted to the MICU service [**2164-1-25**] after a
Code Blue was called for an apparent PEA arrest. The patient
while on Tele on the floor was found to be agonal and
bradycardic to the 30s without a palpable pulse; the patient was
quickly intubated, CPR was intiated, and she received one dose
of atropine with return of a palpable pulse and blood pressure.
An emergent femoral line was placed during the resuscitation;
this was removed once a R subclavian line was placed under
controlled circumstances in the MICU. A CTA was done and was
negative for PE and serial cardiac biomarkers were negative as a
possible etiology of the PEA arrest. A L pleural effusionw as
removed by thoracentesis at the bedside. The patient's mental
status returned to baseline quickly. After discussion with the
pt and the health care proxy, the patient underwent tracheostomy
[**2164-1-27**]. The patient is currently on CPAP/PS 12, FIO2 40%, TV
360s, and will need to be weaned off ventilator as tolerated to
trach mask.  For chronic obstructive lung disease, the patient
has been tapered off steroid from 60mg qday now to 20mg qday.
The patient is to take prednisone 10mg x 3days and off steroid.
It was then noted that the pt's urine output dropped and her
creatinine rose to 1.1, thought to be [**12-22**] contrast dye
nephropathy from the CTA done previously, as well as the cardiac
arrest/hypotension.  Renal u/s revealed new hematoma around her
foley, so a three-way foley was placed and continuous bladder
irrigation was done.  Renal Her creatinine slowly improved, and
her urine output increased slowly.  The patient still has a
foley currently and needs to be removed at rehab as the patient
has urinary tract infection that she is getting treated with
Ciprofloxacin which she will complete on [**2-9**].  For C.diff, she
has been getting Flagyl and will finish 10 day course on
[**2164-2-3**].  The patient will need to f
