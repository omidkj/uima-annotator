Chief Complaint:
transfer for worsening gallstone pancreatitis for ERCP


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 54910**] is a 55 yo male with pmh of htn and COPD trasnferred
from an OSH for worsening pancreatitis complicated by hypoxia,
hypotension, and acute renal failure.  Prior to admission the
patient had had intermittent abdominal pain.  Last Thursday he
developed severe abdominal pain associated with nausea and
vomiting and went to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  He was found to have a
CBD stone and associated pancreatitis on CT.  He was admitted
and medically treated for pancreatitis with IVF.  The day prior
to transfer he was found to have blood sugars in the 500's and
hyperkalemia.  He was started on an insulin gtt and transferred
to the ICU.  He became tachycardic and his UOP decreased
although at that time his SBPs remained stable.  He was given
IVFs.  Over the course of the day he became more tachypneic and
tachycardic and was placed on a NRB.  He also became delirious
and agitated and was intubated the morning of transfer.  After
intbuation his SBPs dropped to the 60's and he was given more
IVF with some improvement.  He has had verly little urine output
since intubation.
.
When he left the OSH he was on an insulin gtt, propofol, but not
on pressors.  He has a Right subclavian CVL and an arterial
line.  Prior to transfer he was on PS 28/8 on FiO2 of 100% with
an ABG of 7.26/74/71.
.
During the [**Location (un) **] his insulin gtt was stopped and he had a FS
checked within the high 100s.  He became difficult to ventilate
with PIPs in the 50's and was changed to AC.  He was briefly
hypotensive and was placed on levo, however this was stopped
before he arrived at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] his sats were in the mid 80's.  He was
normotensive and tachycardic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Given his long hospitalization, his hospital course is
summarized in two parts: the first part is his Intensive Unit
course.  The second part is his floor course.
.
MICU COURSE:
# Respiratory failure:
The patient was intubated the morning of admission at the
outside hospital due to tachypnea and hypoxia in the setting of
receiving many liters of IVF while oliguric.  He was initially
sedated with fentanyl and propofol, switched to propofol and
midazolam.  He was ventilated on ARDS net protocol given
PaO2:FiO2 < 100.  He was initially very difficult to ventilate,
requiring 100% FiO2 and particular positioning.  He was thought
to have abdominal compartment syndrome, compressing his lungs,
causing an increased PEEP requirement.  He had an esophageal
balloon placed temporarily to help estimate pleural pressures
and keep plateau pressures at a goal of < 40.  The esophageal
balloon was taken out after a few days because it passed through
the nasal cavity, and pus drainage was noted draining from his
sinuses.

After the patient was started on CVVH and significant amounts of
fluid were removed, the patient's ventilation status
significantly improved.  His FiO2 and PEEP were weaned down.  He
was maintained on volume controlled ventilation with minute
ventilation calculated to be 11L/min.

By [**10-8**], the patient was weaned down to Pressure Support [**4-18**],
which he was able to tolerate for an extended period of time.
His only barrier to extubation at this time was mental status;
the patient was still not responsive to verbal commands even
with sedation decreased.

Over the next seevral days, the patient's mental status has
improved and he was able to respond to verbal commands with
blinking of his eyes and moving his head.  He was able to move
his upper and lower extremities in response to commands.  He had
a transient increase in vent requirements up to PS 15/5 due to
tachycardia and diaphoresis, low grade fevers, associated with
radiographic findings of bilateral lung infiltrates at the bases
on CXR and CT of the chest without contrast from [**2169-10-11**]
concerning for VAP.  The patient was started on Vanc (at HD),
Zosyn and Cipro for VAP on [**2169-10-11**] with the plan to complete a
total 8 day course (last day [**2169-10-18**]).  Following initiation of
Abx, the vent requirements have decreased to PS 5/5.  He
continues to have occasional low grade febile episodes, but
these may be attributed to necrotic process in his pancereas or
HD line infection.

The patient was successfully extubated on [**2169-10-12**]. At the time
of callout from ICU, he is satting 95+% on RA.  WHile his mental
status is considerably improved, he is still AAO1, at times
confused and very weak.

# Gallstone pancreatitis:
The patient presented to the outside hospital with pancreatitis
and was found to have a CBD stone.  He was medically treated for
pancreatitis with bowel rest and IVF; however, he clinically
continued to worsen and his amylase has continued to rise
raising concern that the stone was still causing blockage and
damage to the pancreas.  An ERCP was done at the bedside the
night the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, during which
10ml of infected appearing bile was drained.  The stone was not
found, but a 9cm 10French biliary stent was placed in the common
bile duct to open up a stricture.

CT scan from [**2169-10-12**] suugested  a possible early forming
pseudocyst and concern for splenic vein thrombosis. Surgery was
consulted and recommended re-imaging with CT a/p to eveluate for
pseudocyst if there is a significant Hct drop given a high risk
of pancreatic bleed.  However, the patient's Hct remained
stable.

The patient was started on TPN.  On [**9-28**], he was started
intermittently on trophic tube feeds as well. While the patient
had high initial residuals, he eventually met nutrition goals
with tube feeds alone and TP
