Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Captopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1850**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 50 y/o male with dm2, chf, copd, pul htn who was
admitted to an osh with aflutter, devloped respiratory failure,
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ongoing respiratory failure.
The patient saw his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**10-1**] and was found to be in aflutter
at 156 and hypotensive to the 90's with evidence of volume
overload.  Previous to this he had been treated with furosemide
for severe chf sx, with orthopnea (slept sitting up) with good
effect, a 20lb weight loss and improved sx; he'd also been
developing dysphagia, choking on solids, liquids, and pills.
He was admitted to a medicine floor at The [**Hospital1 1474**], where his
respiratory status worsened (an ABG showing worsening
hypercarbia at 7.27/96/72) and he was transferred to the ICU and
intubated.  Since that time, his course has been marked by
persistent volume overload and the one febrile spike, with a
sputum cx growing out Strep pneumoniae.
Interestingly the patient recently returned from the
Phillipines.  Blood thick and thin smears were negative for
parasites.

[**2184-10-6**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Lung volumes are quite low exaggerating the caliber of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Nevertheless, there is substantial
real mediastinal widening, but whether this is due to vascular
engorgement alone or a combination of vascular engorgement and
adenopathy is difficult to assess. In addition to interstitial
abnormality throughout the lungs most likely edema. There are
more focal areas of consolidation predominantly in the left
suprahilar and basal lung concerning for pneumonia. ET tube is
in standard placement. Right internal jugular line tip projects
over the superior cavoatrial junction and the nasogastric tube
is looped in the stomach.

EKG
Probable atrial flutter with variable block. Diffuse low
voltage. Delayed
R wave transition. No previous tracing available for comparison
..............
[**2184-10-7**] ECHO
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 y/o male with chf and copd admitted on [**2184-10-6**] with
respiratory failure from pneumococcal pneumonia and volume
overload, in atrial flutter with CHF, s/p cardioversion on [**10-9**]
(heparinized for 3 weeks s/p cardioversion) who grew MRSA in his
sputum while he was difficult to wean and eventually underwent
trach and PEG placement and is being discharged to rehab for
continued wean off vent.
.
1)Respiratory failure/Pneumonia -- Likely a multifactorial
problem, including CHF decompensation, pneumonia (GPC in chains
at OSH, presumes streptococcus), and COPD.  Wheezes on exam, but
not really responsive to bronchodilators.  Pt was intubated on
day of admission with respiratory distress.  Initial CXR was
read as: "there is substantial real mediastinal widening, but
whether this is due to vascular engorgement alone or a
combination of vascular engorgement and adenopathy is difficult
to assess. In addition to interstitial abnormality throughout
the lungs most likely edema. There are more focal areas of
consolidation predominantly in the left suprahilar and basal
lung concerning for pneumonia."  Despite all initial micro data
being negative, he was continued on Vancomycin (7 days total),
Azithromycin (total 5 days given) and Ceftriaxone (10 days)
started on the day of admission.  In addition, on [**10-10**], he was
started on Hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He was
volume overloaded on exam and diuresed daily.  CT chest on [**10-13**]
revealed: "IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with background
pulmonary edema. 2. Partial consolidations in the right upper
and lower lobes, and increased ground-glass in the left upper
lobe. Findings most likely relate to multifocal pneumonia. 3.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on
the left."  During this time, attempts to wean were unsuccessful
with high RISBs and agitation if not sedated.  Bronchoscopy
performed on [**10-15**] revelaed a clear L side and R sided
secretions.  Micro data from the BAL was positive for MRSA.
Vanc and Zosyn (4 days given) were restarted on [**10-15**] for
continued secretions and inability to wean.  He underwent trach
on [**10-21**] without event.  RISB data was as high as 600s at this
time.  PS trials were not successful.  On [**10-22**], pt spiked fever
to 101.  Secretions increased but micro data revealed only MRSA
with blood and urine Cx negative.  Ct chest on [**10-24**] revealed:
"There is interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions.
There is also improvement in the right upper lobe atelectasis.
There are persistent partial atelectasis of the lower lobes
likely due to associated pleural effusion. There is also
interval improvement in the ground-glass opacities likely due to
pulmonary edema. IMPRESSION: 1. Interval improvement in
pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and atelectasis. 2.
Cardiomegaly. 3. Calcifications of the right coronary artery. 4.
Small amount of ascites."  Vanco was stopped on the [**10-26**] s/p >2
weeks of coverage.  Throughout this time, he retained a good
amount of fluid and daily lasix was required to diurese him and
prevent effusions.  All remaining micro data yielded only MRSA
in the sputum.  For increased secretions and elevated
temperature, he was restarted on Vancomycin on [**11-1**] per ID with
a goal of a 7 day course.  CT sinus done on [**11-1**] to rule out
sinusitis revealed: "IMPRESSION: Mild mucosal thickening in the
maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinus. Partial opacification in
the mastoid air cells bilaterally."  By day of discharge,
secretions are improved and pt feels significantly better.  He
has been out of bed to the chair for over a week.  He had good
urine output.  He is afebrile x 2 days.  The goal is to
discharge to rehab for eventual wean from trach.
.
2) [**Name (NI) **] Pt initially hypotensive but eventuall
hypertensive and thus started on ACE inhibitor.  Initially this
was Captopril but pt developed a rash and peripheral
eosinophilia after 3 days and was switched per pharm
recommendations to Lisinopril.  The rash subsequently resolved
and the BP is well controlled at time of discharge.

3) CHF -- Pt with CT consistent with PNA on admissi
