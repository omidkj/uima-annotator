Service:  MEDICAL ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 66 year old
female who presented with light-headedness, dizziness,
hematemesis, to an outside hospital on [**2112-6-6**], and was
found to have a hematocrit of 15.0 and workup was consistent
with an upper gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was
transfused a total of sixteen units of packed red blood cells
and four units of fresh frozen plasma at the outside
hospital.  At the outside hospital, the patient underwent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2112-6-6**], which revealed grade
IV esophagitis, bleeding ulcer 3.0 centimeters proximal to
the gastroesophageal junction and this bleeding ulcer was
cauterized and injected.  At the outside hospital, the
patient continued to bleed actively with falling hematocrit
and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy two more times.  On
[**2112-6-7**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a spurting
visible vessel in the distal esophagus and 9cc of Epinephrine
were injected.  On [**2112-6-8**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy
revealed old blood in the fundus and the distal esophagus was
injected a third time.  At the outside hospital, the patient
was intubated for airway protection as she was noted to have
hematemesis with likely aspiration.  The patient was
extubated briefly but reintubated after another episode of
hematemesis.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2112-6-11**], for further management
of her upper gastrointestinal bleed and respiratory status.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
2.  Malaria.
3.  Filariasis.
4.  Thyroid surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Octreotide.
2.  Reglan.
3.  Protonix.
4.  Levaquin.
5.  Clindamycin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient
is an obese woman, intubated and sedated.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
The oropharynx is with endotracheal tube in place.  Heart -
regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Lungs - decreased breath sounds bilateral lower
lobes, coarse upper airway sounds.  Abdomen is obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds.  Extremities -
2+ pulses throughout, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologically, the patient is sedated, responsive to sternal
rub.

PERTINENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell
count was 10.0, hematocrit 30.2, platelet count 230,000.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.6, chloride 108, bicarbonate 27,
blood urea nitrogen 13, creatinine 0.5, glucose 114, calcium
7.9, phosphate 3.2, magnesium 1.7.  ALT 10, AST 10, alkaline
phosphatase 60, total bilirubin 1.0.  Prothrombin time 13.9,
INR 1.3, partial thromboplastin time 24.6.

Chest x-ray showed the endotracheal tube in proper position,
patchy alveolar opacity in the right lung, opacity with air
bronchograms in the left retrocardiac region, differential
diagnosis multifocal aspiration, pneumonia, asymmetric
pulmonary edema.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 71 beats per
minute, no ST-T wave changes, normal axis, normal intervals.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed - The patient's hematocrit
remained stable in the low 30.0s and high 20.0s throughout
her hospital stay.  The patient did not require a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and she remained guaiac negative
with no signs or symptoms of active bleed.  The patient did
receive one unit of packed red blood cells on [**2112-6-22**], for a
slowly decreasing hematocrit to 27.0 over several days.  Her
hematocrit responded appropriately to this one unit of packed
red blood cells and she did not require further transfusions.
The patient was maintained on proton pump inhibitor
throughout her hospital stay.  Octreotide was continued until
[**2112-6-15**], when it was stopped with gastroenterology approval.

2.  Respiratory distress - The patient was transferred here
intubated and sedated.  The patient was difficult to wean
from the ventilator likely due to a combination of bilateral
atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, pneumonia,
pulmonary edema.  The patient also was found to have a right
pneumothorax on [**2112-6-17**].  No instrumentation had been
performed on that side, and chest x-rays from the previous
days had not shown a pneumothorax.  Likely, it was a side
effect of being intubated on the ventilator as well as due to
underlying chronic lung disease.  A chest tube was placed on
the right with good results.  The patient's bilateral pleural
effusions were decreased with diuresis as well as on the
right side with the placement of the chest tube.  Right
pleural fluid was serosanguinous with 400 white blood cells,
50% polys, total protein 2.9, glucose 107, LDH 515, gram
stain negative.  The patient was started on Ceftriaxone on
[**2112-6-17**], for her left lower lobe consolidation as well as
spiking fever.  On [**2112-6-19**], the patient's pleural fluid and
the blood culture bottle was positive for gram positive
cocci.  The patient was afebrile and continued on the
Ceftriaxone.  Chest x-ray on [**2112-6-20**], showed that the
pneumothorax had resolved.  On [**2112-6-21**], the patient was
extubated and her oxygen saturation remained in the 90s on
nonrebreather face mask.  The patient briefly required CPAP
via face mask as she clinically was requiring great effort
for breathing.  The patient was started on Albuterol and
Ipratropium nebulizers q4hours, standing dose.  On [**2112-6-22**],
the patient was switched from Ceftriaxone after five days to
Ceftazidime and Vancomycin for increased white blood cell
count and fever to 102 degrees with continued left lower lobe
consolidation.  These antibiotics were chosen to cover
broadly for pneumonia pathogens including pseudomonas as well
as hospital line infection from her central line.  On
[**2112-6-22**], chest x-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, and
the patient was clinically with crackles bilaterally in the
lungs two thirds of the way up.  The patient was restarted on
Lasix p.r.n. with a goal of minus one to two liters each day.
The patient responded very well to diuresis and pulmonary
edema decreased significantly.  The patient's Lasix dose was
decreased on [**2112-6-28**].  With good diuresis as well as
treatment of the pneumonias and pneumothorax, the patient was
weaned slowly on oxygen from nonrebreather face mask after
extubation to nasal cannula by [**2112-6-28**].  On [**2112-6-27**],
Vancomycin and Ceftazidime were discontinued as the patient
had received six days of these antibiotics as well as five
days of Ceftriaxone and was clinically stable with no signs
or symptoms of infection.  The same day the patient's
arterial line and central line were removed.

3.  Mental Status Changes - The patient initially transferred
here sedated.  After extubation and weaning of sedation, the
patient remained responsive but clearly confused and
disoriented.  The patient's TSH and free T4 were within
normal limits.  Head CT on [**2112-6-26**], was negative for an
acute process.  Psychiatry was consulted and the patient was
started on Haldol 4 mg and then increased to 6 mg q.h.s.  The
patient also responded well to Haldol p.r.n. for agitation.
The patient also received Ativan 2 mg once for agitation with
good effect.  The patient's mental status changes were
gradually improved on a daily basis and by [**2112-6-29**], she was
conversant and appropriate.  The patient was not yet back to
her high baseline mental status, but no further workup was
deemed necessary.  The patient's mental status changes were
thought to be due to the fact that she was intubated for
several weeks, on Propofol.  Also, in the Intensive Care Unit
setting, the patient was likely very sleep deprived,
contributing to somnolence and agitation intermittently.

4.  Cardiovascular - The patient with no known cardiac
history but with pulmonary edema which contributed to
difficulty to wean from ventilator as well as from oxygen
after extubation.  Echocardiogram on [**2112-6-22**], reveal
