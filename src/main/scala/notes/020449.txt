Admission Date:  [**2167-2-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-3-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2093-11-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
Spanish-speaking only with a history of hypertension and
diabetes who was admitted for progressively worsening
shortness of breath.  Over two months prior to admission the
patient experienced increased exertional shortness of breath
as well as two-pillow orthopnea, and peripheral edema.  She
did not have any episodes of chest pain.  She was admitted
initially to [**Hospital3 17310**] where she had a chest
x-ray demonstrating congestive heart failure.  She was ruled
out for myocardial infarction.  An echocardiogram there
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with wall motion
abnormalities as well as severe mitral regurgitation.  She
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Significant for)
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Type II diabetes.
3.  Status post appendectomy.
4.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unremarkable.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d., IV heparin, IV Lasix 40 mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  She was relaxed with no
evidence of acute distress.  Temperature was afebrile and
hemodynamically stable, was satting 95% on 2 liters.  Heart
had normal sounds, 3/6 systolic murmur over the left sternal
border radiating to the axilla.  Lungs revealed good breath
sounds bilaterally but she did have bibasilar crackles.
Abdomen revealed normal bowel sounds, soft, and nontender.
Extremities revealed +1 edema, nontender.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three and
grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count of 4.3, hematocrit
of 46.4, platelets 159.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.2,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 31, BUN 21, creatinine 0.9, glucose
of 40.  Hemoglobin A1c was 7.3.  CKs were 35, 85, and 60.

Troponin was less than 0.1.  She had a normal set of liver
function tests.

EKG on admission demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with
.................... pattern but no acute ST changes.  No
evidence for old myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73-year-old with history
of hypertension and diabetes, admitted initially to the
cardiac service after being ruled out for myocardial
infarction at [**Hospital3 17310**].  The patient had a
cardiac catheterization on [**2-13**] which showed clean
coronaries but very severe mitral regurgitation.  The patient
was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgical service and
had a mitral valve replacement with a porcine valve on
[**2-16**].  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Postoperative period was complicated with failure to wean.
In addition, she was taken to the operating room twice
postoperatively.  Once for tamponade secondary to bleeding
and the second time for entangled Swan-Ganz catheter in the
atrial sutures.  She was postoperative atrial fibrillation on
postoperative day 10, for which she was started on
amiodarone.  She also had postoperative pneumonia which was
treated with .................... with levofloxacin.  Sputum
cultures and blood cultures were entirely negative except for
1/4 bottles growing Staphylococcus epidermidis which was
thought to be a contaminant.  Due to failure to wean she was
transferred to the intensive care unit on [**3-3**];
however, soon afterwards was extubated and since then
remained off the ventilator.  She was diuresed aggressively
with Lasix, and in addition was treated with captopril for
afterload reduction.  Postoperative echocardiogram showed
evidence for global hypokinesis, multiple cardiac effusion,
mild mitral regurgitation with decreased leaflet motion of
the valve with elevated gradient higher than what would be
expected with this prosthesis.  Given this, the patient was
kept on good regimen with beta blockers and captopril.  She
was called out from the intensive care unit to the medical
floor on [**3-7**].  Since then she has been hemodynamically
stable.  No recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation on
amiodarone.  She was diuresed further with Lasix and was kept
on the same medications.  Of note, she did have an episode of
vasovagal after being in the rest room; however, no recurrent
episodes, no arrhythmias documented.

The patient was seen by physical therapy and acute
rehabilitation was suggested.  The patient was to be
discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] to
.....................
