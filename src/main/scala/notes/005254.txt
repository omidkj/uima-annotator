Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, cerebral SDH & SAH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85 yo man w/ PMH of CAD, CHF, DMII, CLL, and recent TIA who fell
resulting in extensive SAH and SDH. Patient was walking when he
bent forward to pick up dropped mail, lost his balance, and fell
backwards hitting the posterior of his head on the ground. His
son who witnessed the event states that the patient had no LOC.
EMT was called and on arrival to OSH, he was nauseous, vomiting,
and had blood draining from his L ear. Head CT showed extensive
SAH and SDH and a L temporal bone fracture, and the patient was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Patient had no
prodrome or preceeding palpitations, chest pain, dizziness,
headaches, no recent fever or chills, and no visual changes. No
seizure or fall history. Patient had a TIA 2 weeks ago
characterized by slurred speech. He had been on ASA and plavix,
but discontinued after the TIA and was switched to aggrenox.
.
The patient was admitted to neurosurgery, but due to the
extensive bleed, there were no surgical options, so he was
medically managed with seizure prophylaxis.  The NeuroICU course
was c/b NSTEMI ([**2130-2-8**] CK=1338), CHF exacerbation, and desats
into the 80's. Patient was on lasix gtt for volume overload.
ECHO on [**2-7**] showed EF>55%, moderate diastolic dysfunction. EKG
showed periods of SVT. Per cardiology consult, treatment options
were limited as the pt cannot be on anti-platelet agents or
anticoagulants due to SAH and SDH. The patient was medically
managed w/ beta blocker, ACE I, statin, and lasix IV for CHF.
The patient has a history of CLL and his WBC trended up from 66K
on admission to 88K.

Past Medical History:
-Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diagnosed one year ago
-Transient Ischemic Attack 2 weeks ago causing slurred speech,
resolved without intervention
-CAD s/p stenting 10 years ago

[**2130-2-7**]: Non-contrast head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive
subarachnoid hemorrhage seen within the frontal lobes
bilaterally, right frontal lobe, left parietal lobe. Layering
blood also seen within the lateral ventricles.
2. Intraparenchymal contusion/hemorrhage seen within the
anterior frontal lobes bilaterally. 3. Subdural hematoma seen in
the frontal regions bilaterally, and tracking along the falx. 4.
Nondisplaced fractures of the left temporal bone, with
associated hemotympanum.

[**2130-2-9**] Cardiac ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Cerebral SAH/SDH: Initial head CT on [**2-7**] showed extensive SDH
and SAH with blood in the lateral ventricles, no mid-line shift,
left temporal bone fracture, and hemotympanum. Patient was
admitted to neurosurgical ICU. Neurosurgery was consulted and no
surgical intervention was indicated because of extensive nature
of SDH and SAH and poor prognosis. Repeat head CT on [**2-8**] showed
no significant interval change. He was started on phenytoin
100mg po tid for seizure prophylaxis.
.
#NSTEMI: Patient had NSTEMI on [**2-7**]. EKG showed diffuse ST
depressions. Per cardiology, patient was not a good candidate
for catherization because of his extensive SAH and SDH such that
he could not be placed on anti-platlet therapy afterwards.
Patient medically managed with B blocker, nitroglycerin, ACEI,
and atorvastatin 80mg po daily. No anti-coagulation or
anti-platlet therapy added. Family discussion confirmed DNR/DNI
status and patient preference for non-invasive care. On [**2-8**],
CK-MB elevated to 88 and troponin elevated to 2.78.  He was
monitored on telemetry and had episodes of paroxysmal SVT to
120's, otherwise HR well controlled to 60's. Metoprolol dose was
increased to 50mg po bid.
.
#SOB: Patient with desats to 70-80's on [**2130-2-10**] at night thought
to be due to flash pulmonary edma secondary to diastolic heart
failure and NSTEMI on [**2-7**]. Patient improved with 40mg IV lasix
and lopressor 5mg IV. The patient's urine output was monitored
and was good. On [**2130-2-11**] in the AM, patient had a desat to
mid-80's, HR's 60-80's, BP 148/62. He improved with 10L O2 by
facemask, nitropaste topically, and nebulizer. CXR did not show
worsening compared to prior. EKG showed ST depression in
anterolateral leads. Due to concern for aspiration and mucous
plugging, tube feeds were held and chest PT and deep suctioning
were performed with improved respiratory status. Later that day,
the patient had increased SOB, somnelence, tachycardia, and was
febrile. Medical team met with the family to discuss care
options of MICU with intubation or CMO given that patient was
DNI. During family discussion, patient began agonal breathing
and passed away.
.
#Pneumonia: On [**2130-2-10**], there was concern for aspiration PNA due
to persistent R lower lobe hazy opacity since admission, low
grade fever to 100.8, and increased cough. The patient had
persistent leukocytosis due to CLL. Sputum gram stain and
culture were ordered. Patient was started on vancomycin 1000mg
IV q48 hrs and Zosyn 2.25 gm IV q6.
.
Diastolic Dysfunction/CHF: Patient had an ECHO on [**2130-2-9**] showing
LVEF>55%. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Grade
II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation, moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation, and
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is seen. His
lisinopril 5mg was held because of creatinine trending up to
2.5.
.
#HTN: Patient was on atenolol 25mg qam on admission, this was
changed to metoprolol and was titrated to metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
for improved HTN control. He was on lisinopril 5mg daily on
admission which was discontinued due to rising creatinine.
.
#CLL: WBC trended up from 66k to 88k on [**2130-2-10**] and decreased to
76.7K on [**2130-2-11**]. Patient was on leukoram 2mg daily on admission,
this was held during admission due to ac
