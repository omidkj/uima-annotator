Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25682**] is a 41 year old woman presenting with decompensated
cirrhosis in the setting of SBP and alcoholic hepatitis with and
hepatorenal syndrome type 1 with hepatic encephalopathy grade 1.
She had a hospital course that was complicated by ATN
necessitating CVVH, and an episodes of aspiration and mucous
plugging leading to respiratory distress and hypoxic respiratory
failure.  She was transfered to the MICU for further care.  In
the MICU she started to withdraw from alcohol and was
hypotensive requirng pressors.  Her liver function improved
slightly and dialysis was initiated.  Unfortunately, she
developed multiple episodes of spontaneous intraperitoneal
bleeding requiring transfusion of 10 units of pRBC's.  In the
context of this and her very poor prognosis suggested by her
recent drinking, poor functional status, anuric renal failure,
and need for frequent paracenteses, she elected to stop life
prolonging therapies and desired transfer closer to home to a
less medicalized environment.  Therefore, she is being
transferred to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with hospice services.  Her treatments are
to be focused on comfort with no further transfusions,
parancenteses, or renal replacement therapy.  Code Status is
CMO/DNR/DNI.  She is being discharged to [**Hospital 19586**] hospice
tolerating PO nutrition and taking oral PO medications.
