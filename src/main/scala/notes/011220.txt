Chief Complaint:
Seizure activity and hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation in ICU
Intrajugular vein IV access


History of Present Illness:
83 y.o with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems who initially presented to
OSH with N/V and confusion and was given neurontin and ativan
for restless legs. Patient also noted to have a WBC of 21.7,
temperature of 100F and a positive UA treated with Levofloxacin.
Soon after she had tonic-clonic seizure,given ativan and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
[**Hospital1 18**]-ED Hx: patient agitated and restless on arrival ([**10-9**])
and noted to be hypertensive to SBP > 200. Also, hypoxic and CXR
consistent with CHF. Patient then sedated with ativan and
electively intubated for head CT and LP. Her DNR/DNI code status
was reversed after discussion with family for purposes of Head
CT and LP. Patient also received one dose of Lasix 80 mg, Vanco,
Levo and 2gm ceftriaxone. While in EW, she ruled in for MI, R
inguinal hematoma following femoral line attempt with subsequent
HCT drop from 34 to 28 in ED. Patient sent to MICU at 0200
[**10-10**].
In MICU CT Abd/pelvis [**10-9**] showed 11x2 cm hematoma, vascular
consulted:  no surgical intervention, pt recieved total of
3units of PRBCstransfused and Hct stabilized.  Patient's head CT
[**10-9**] showed left occipital density possible c/w infarction but
no focal neuro findings; MRI [**10-10**] r/o??????d CVA, CT findings
thought [**1-14**] hypertensive changes. LP showed no blood and neg CSF
culture.  HTN controlled w/ Lopressor, nifedipine, clonidine,
and isosorbide dinitrate ?????? weaned from nitro drip [**10-13**]
NSTEMI was felt to be likely [**1-14**] demand ischemia,EKG showed no
further ischemic changes.
The pt also treated with 3d course of ceftriaxone for presumed
UTI (culture negative.
Pt also had fluctuating sensorium in ICU which appeared resolved
at time of transfer to the floor.
 No sz activity observed at [**Hospital1 18**] and no anti-epileptics given
here.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]-ED on [**10-9**] for seizure activity and
SBP 200 at OSH.  At [**Hospital1 42457**], pt was intubated and taken to CT
scanner; a R. femoral line attempt was complicated by an
inguinal hematoma with subsequent Hct drop.  Pt was transfered
to MICU for dropping Hct and continued hypertensive urgency.  In
MICU, blood pressure was controlled w/ nitro drip, lopressor,
nifedipine, clonidine, and isosorbide dinitrate. Pt was ruled in
for NSTEMI by enzymes.  Anemia was corrected with 3U PRBC and
Hct stabilized.  Mental status also fluctuated during MICU
course. Pt was treated with Vanco, Levo, and Ceftriaxone for
clinical signs of sepsis and  UTI (positive UA/negative
cultures) prior to adm. Pt was transfered to medical floor
(FAR7)once stabile on [**10-13**] for monitoring.  On FAR7, pt.
remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile, mental status
improved to baseline, there was no seizure activity, and pt was
discharged to home with services in good condition.

Problem list:
1. Hypertensive emergency - treated with mutliple agents in
MICU, BP improved and remained stable during course on FAR7 and
was discharaged on PO medications only.
2. Seziure activity - EEG showed underlying structural
abnormalities, no antiepileptics were given at [**Hospital1 18**] as per
neurology recommendations. Outpatient MRI also recommended.
3. NSTEMI - probably secondary to demand ischemia during MICU
course.  Pt has remained hemodynamically stable during course on
FAR7 with one episode of angina (with no changes in EKG) that
pt. describes as typical of her 20yr pre-adm history.
4. CHF - patient stabilized with lopressor, diuresis (Lasix),
and other antihypertensives in MICU.  No signs/sx of CHF during
course on FAR7
5. Anemia - pt experienced acute drop in Hct during MICU course,
most likely secondary to R. inguinal hematoma.  Hct stabilized
after 3U PRBC given in MICU and has remained stable during FAR7
course.
6. L. occipital lobe cerebral ischemia - findings on CT during
MICU course ruled out for CVA by MRI scan.  CT findings most
likely secondary to hypertensive episode.
7. AMS - pt. experienced fluctuating sensorium in MICU but was
A&Ox3 on transfer to FAR7 and remained so throughout rest of
hospital course.
8. UTI - treated with 3d course of ceftriaxone completed in
MICU. Pt was asymptomatic on adm to FAR7 and remained so
throughout rest of hospital course.
