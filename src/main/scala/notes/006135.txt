History of Present Illness:
81 y/o male with extensive coronary history who presented with
cough and malaise x 1 day.  The patient has a chronic cough but
felt worse over the past day.  Also associated with nb/nb emesis
x 1.  Came to emergency room and triggered immediately for HTN
with presure in 60's on arrivals, repeat SBP 90-100, but then
his blood pressures fell again.  He was in rapid atria
fibrilation on arrival with an initial rate of 133.  His
temperature was 97 orally temperature and 102.8 rectally.

Of note, Last week he had been admitted to the cardiology
service for DOE with cath, MIBI demonstrating diastolic failure,
CABG consistent with prior cath showing widely patent.  He was
diuresed during that admission with resolution of symptoms and
discharged.

Chest x-ray with no findings but empirically treated with broad
antibiotics for presumed HAP. New acute renal failure,
elevations in Alk Phos/AST/Lipase.  A right IJ, and blood
cultures were obtained.  Levophed was started.  Urine cultures
were obtained. In the context of putting in the IJ the patient's
HR went to the 60's.

The patient's laboratory data demonstrated new renal failure,
leukocytosis, elevated AST and lipase.  Abdominal ultrasound
demonstrated RUQ cholelethiasis without cholecystitis.  Nutmeg
liver reaction, common bile duct within normal limits.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation.
Vitals at the time of transfer were 99.8 81 124/60.  SVO2 80,
CVP 2. He received a total of 2 liters of fluid in the emergency
room.

[**2205-1-22**]: Triple phase MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large hepatic mass with rapid arterial enhancement and
washout consistent with a hepatocellular carcinoma.

2. The right portal vein is occluded with tumor thrombus and the
proximal
left portal vein is also likely occluded. Non occlusive tumor
thrombus is
also noted within the main portal vein and there is cavernous
transformation
at the porta hepatis.

[**2205-1-20**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION: Essentially unremarkable chest CT without evidence
for infection or metastatic disease. Incompletely assessed large
liver mass.

MRI [**1-17**]: Large mass almost completely replacing the right lobe
of liver with invasion of the right portal vein. The left portal
vein may also be occluded. The imaging features are far more
suggestive of tumor than abscess. Differential would include a
primary HCC, cholangioncarcinoma or a metastasis.

EKG [**2205-1-16**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Early R wave transition. Q waves in leads II, III and
aVF suggest possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2205-1-8**] atrial fibrillation
is new.

EKG [**2205-1-17**]: Normal sinus rhythm. Q waves in leads II, III, aVF
and V4-V6 suggest possible prior inferior and myocardial
infarction. Compared to tracing #1 atrial fibrillation has been
replaced by normal sinus rhythm.

CXR [**2205-1-16**]: FINDINGS: Midline sternotomy wires are unchanged.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from
prior study. The lungs are clear. The lung volumes are low.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The osseous
structures demonstrate degenerative changes of the
acromioclavicular joints.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**1-17**]: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There is a large mass in
the right lobe of the liver which is echogenic and does not
demonstrate any detectable flow on Doppler images. There is
normal hepatopetal flow in the portal vein some foci of
posterior shadowing are concerning for air in the mass. The
common duct measures 2 mm.

Small stones are noted in the gallbladder, which is partially
collapsed
without wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The pancreas was
not visualized due to shadowing bowel gas. There is no free
fluid in the abdomen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for hepatic abscess. Differential
diagnosis includes necrotic tumor such as HCC although this is
considered less likely. Please evaluate with multiphasic liver
CT. This was called to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2204-1-18**] at 8:25 a.m.

2. Cholelithiasis, without acute cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 M with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2196**], mild aortic stenosis,
distolic heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who
presented on [**1-16**] with fever, worsening cough, nb/nb vomiting x
1, palpitations, and dyspnea.  Initial concern was for sepsis,
however no etiology was determined.  Patient was temporarily in
ICU on pressors and zosyn, but both were discontinued without
problem.  During workup, found to have large liver mass which
was determined to be hepatocellular carcinoma. Patient was set
up with Oncology and discharged home.

1) Hepatocellular carcinoma:  During workup in ICU, was found to
have elevated liver function tests.  RUQ ultrasound showed a
large mass which was further investigated with MRI.  This was
concerning for Hepatocellular carcinoma versus
cholangiocarcinoma.  AFP returned > 50,000.  After consultation
with Oncology and Hepatology, a triple phase MRI was performed
which confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.  The
patient was set up with Oncology follow up.  The tumor was noted
to be i
