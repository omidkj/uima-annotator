Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Dialysis via CVVH


History of Present Illness:
78 yo male with CAD s/p [**First Name3 (LF) **] x2 to LAD, CHF (EF 25-30%), CKD
(baseline Cr 2.2), and aortic stenosis recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] for hemoptysis attributed to
tracheobronchitis/pneumonitis, but not improved after 5d course
of azithromycin, who re-presented to two outside hospitals for
acutely decompensated CHF. On admission to OSH, patient was
diuresed with furosemide 80mg iv bid.  He had a positive
troponin T to 0.8 without significant ECG changes from baseline,
but was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and possible
catheterization.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS were T99.8F, BP 138-148/76-100, HR 75,
RR 22, 88% 4L.  Patient was tachypnic with oxygen saturations in
the 80s on 4LNC.  He was placed on a non-rebreather with
improved saturations to high 90s but still with labored
breathing.  CXR was consistent with volume overload, but also
concerning for a right middle/lower lobe opacity. Of note, this
opacity was seen on a CXR during recent admission and was
concerning for malignancy vs tracheobronchitis/ pneumonitis.
During prior admission, patient was treated with azithromycin,
with instructions for follow-up CXR and CT scan in [**3-15**] weeks.
Sputum culture was sent and patient was started on IV vancomycin
and cefepime and transferred to CCU for further management.
Prior to transfer, patient was given 160mg IV bolus of lasix.
.
On arrival to CCU, VS were HR 128, BP 155/47, RR 21, O2Sat 88%on
100%FiO2 non rebreather.  Patient was started on lasix gtt and
nitroglycerin gtt.  He was placed on bipap.

Urine legionella antigen: negative
Blood cx: pending

EKG: Sinus tachycardia with first degree AV block. ST elevations
in V1-V2 likely rate related. Nonspecific ST-T wave changes
unchanged from previous EKG from [**2113-7-3**].

Carotid doppler ultrasound ([**2113-7-27**]):
1. No significant carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.
2. Calcified atherosclerotic plaques in carotid bulbs and
internal carotid
artery.

EEG ([**Date range (1) 37371**]): This EEG was compatible initially with
electrographic
status epilepticus which appeared to resolve, as noted above,
leaving
the record showing a moderate diffuse encephalopathy without any
clear
focal or lateralizing features.

EEG ([**Date range (1) 37372**]): This EEG gives evidence for a moderate
diffuse
encephlopathy. There were no clear interictal epileptic
discharges.
The patient does appear to be excessively drowsy and did
progress
rapidly into slow wave sleep when left unattended.

CT Chest w/o contrast ([**2113-8-2**]):
1. Ectatic ascending aorta is free of calcification.
Calcification of aortic valve is severe whereas in annulus is
moderate.
2. Mild cardiomegaly with severe atherosclerotic calcification
involving the coronary arteries and calcification of mitral
annulus.
3. Ground-glass opacities in the right lung have significantly
regressed since [**2113-7-1**]. Opacities in the right middle and
lower lobes likely
atelectasis or pneumonia are unchanged.
4. Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion with minimal
interval decrease in the left pleural effusion since [**2113-7-1**].

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo male with CAD s/p [**Year (4 digits) **] x2 to LAD, CHF (EF 25-30%), CKD
(baseline Cr 2.2), and aortic stenosis presenting with volume
overload and concern for infection.

# Flash pulmonary edema: Patient has a known depressed EF of
25-30%, with aortic stenosis further worsening output.  Patient
likely had flash pulmonary edema causing acute dyspnea and
oxygen desaturations. He diuresed well with lasix drip and
chlorothiazide.  Patient required bipap for oxygenation briefly
but then was maintaining oxygen saturations and comfortable with
nasal cannula. On HD5 patient was noted to have a new O2
requirement in the setting of fever and non-convulsive fevers.
He was started on facemask oxygen and transferred back to the
CCU. He was on CVVH with marked improvement in his respiratory
status, and CVVH was discontinued. At the time of discharge he
was on room air with good oxygen saturations.

Patient was evaluated by cardiac surgery for aortic valve
replacement.  Patient would like to have the surgery, and so
pre-operative workup was started.  Patient will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28946**] as an outpatient regarding timing and scheduling of
surgery.

# Seizures: On the morning HD 5 patient was noted to be
disoriented and not responding appropriately to verbal stimuli.
He was noted to be staring into space and only intermittently
answering questions.  He was also febrile to 103 rectal and
required transfer back to the CCU.  His antibiotic coverage was
broadened, cefepime was changed to zosyn and an EE
