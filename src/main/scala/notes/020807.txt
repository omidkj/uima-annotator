IMAGING:
# CT Head w/o contrast- no intracranial process
# CT C-spine w/o contrast-
  1. No fracture or malalignment.
  2. Moderate to severe degenerative changes, espec. C4/5& C5/6
# Pelvis AP x-ray- no fracture
# Chest x-ray- Left upper lobe/perihilar opacity might represent
pneumonia. Healed left rib fractures. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
and no pneumothorax.
  IMPRESSION: Left upper lobe opacity might represent pneumonia.


CHEST CT IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia.
2. Partially visualized 3-cm partially exophytic left interpolar
renal mass
warrants further workup with MRI.
3. Prominent thyroid gland extending into the superior
mediastinum with
heterogeneous parenchyma likely represents substernal goiter;
however, further
workup with ultrasound should be considered.
4. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy might be reactive.
However given the
large size, followup with chest CT is recommended to rule out
neoplastic
involvement (metastasis) after workup of the left kidney and
thyroid mass
5. Small-to-moderate left and small right pleural effusion with
mild
associated bibasilar atelectasis.

BRAIN MRI:
IMPRESSION: Scattered foci of high signal intensity in the
subcortical and
periventricular white matter, likely reflecting chronic
microvascular ischemic
disease. Mild mucosal thickening identified at the maxillary
sinuses
bilaterally, more significant on the right and also mild mucosal
thickening at
the ethmoidal air cells.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 year-old female with h/o PE on coumadin, COPD/asthma,
HTN/DM2, found down on floor, noted to have fever, leukocytosis
w/bandemia and elevated lactate.

#. Sepsis/community acquired PNA/fever- On admission, patient
met SIRS criteria for temperature, white count and heart rate.
She was found to have a pneumonia on both cxr and CT scan.  She
was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, but she
improved dramatically, so she was switched to oral levaquin,
which she tolerated well.

# Hilar lymphadenopathy:  Found to have enlarged perihilar lymph
nodes on CT scan of the chest.  These are likely reactive to the
pneumonia, but radiologists advise to also r/o any possible
primary malignancy.  She has known renal mass which is being
followed by [**Hospital1 112**] urologist Dr [**First Name (STitle) 2643**] and also has irregular
thyroid seen on CT scan.  I was in contact with PCP regarding
this, and advised f/u renal MRI to see if renal mass is
enlarging or consideration of renal biopsy to definitively r/o
that the peri-hilar [**Doctor First Name **] does not represent metastatic disease
from renal cell carcinoma.  I also advised outpatient thyroid
ultrasound.
.
#. ?Syncope/found down: Patient was found down at home w/
evidence of defecation.   I suspect that she became hypotensive
on account of her pneumonia and had some kind of vasovagal
event.  There were no arrhythmias seen on telemetry, and Brain
MRI did not show any lesion or CVA.   She ambulated well with PT
in the hospital.
.
#. Acute renal failure:   Resolved in the hospital.  Instructed
to resume cozaar on returning home.
.
# History of PE:   INR therapeutic at time of discharge.

#Ear pain-Patient complained of severe intermittent pain near
left ear.  No pain over mastoid or parotid.  Has long standing
hearing loss and tinnitus.  Exam of ear revealed cerumenosis and
perforated Left TM (old).  She was seen by ENT who felt that she
had TMJ syndrome and advised NSAIDS.  Her pain was very well
treated with NSAIDS.  Given that she will be using them at home
on a prn basis, she was also started on omeprazole

#. DM2:  She was advised to resume home meds on discharge.
However, the quinolone antibiotics may precipitate hypoglycemia,
so she was advised to take half the dose of glyburide for three
days, during which she would be taking quinolone abx.
.
#. COPD/asthma:   Continued on home meds.
.
#. HTN:  Well controlled after she recovered from her SIRS
presentation.
