Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterizations: [**2113-3-30**] & [**2113-3-31**]


History of Present Illness:
85F with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on amiodarone, reported EF of 32% who reports with
increasing substernal [**7-14**] chest pressure lasting 15 minutes to
hours with radiation to her neck, associated with palpitations,
exacerbated with movement, alleviated with rest. Patient reports
that she's had increasing chest pain over the past few months
who presents with increasing chest pain pver 5 days refusing to
go to the ED but came to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**]??????s office on [**2113-3-29**].
He did blood tests and told her to go to the ED. She did not and
instead went home. The labs came back with a troponin of 2.28 so
he called her and had her come to [**Location (un) **] ED for transport to
our cath lab. Of note she had a nuclear stress test in [**12-10**] that
was reported as completely normal. Her EF was 32%.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
C.CATH Study Date of [**2113-3-29**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed
severe
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery
had no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The
LAD had a
90% stenosis in the mid segment involving the bifurcation of the
first
major diagonal branch.  The LCX was a large caliber dominant
artery and
had no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The
RCA was a
small caliber nondominant vessel with no angiographically
apparent flow
limiting stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed low right sided filling
pressures
(mean RA pressure was 3 mm Hg and RVEDP was 4 mm Hg).  Pulmonary
artery
pressures were normal (PA pressure was 30/11 mm Hg).  Left sided
filling
pressures were normal (mean PCW pressure was 13 mm Hg).
Systemic
arterial pressure ranged from low to normal (aortic pressure
averaged
90/47 mm Hg).  Cardiac output was low (CI was 2.1 L/min/m2).
Post
intervention and bolus administration normal saline, left sided
filling
pressures were slightly higher (mean PCW pressure was 14 mm Hg).

3. Successful PCI/stent to mid LAD/Diagonal bifurcation with a
3.0x23mm
Cypher stent deployed at 14atms. Excellent result with normal
flow and
no residual stenosis in both vessels. Patient left cathlab
painfree.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Low right sided filling pressures and relatively low left
sided
filling pressures.
3. Successful rotation atherectomy, angioplasty, and stenting
with DES
of the mid LAD with rescue of the first diagonal branch.

CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-3-30**] 9:32 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed but hematoma in right
groin in soft tissues at site of recent cath.
2. Heavy coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
3. Low-attenuation lesion in segment 3 of the liver which is too
small to characterize but may represent a cyst.
4. Minimal free fluid in the pelvis.
5. Catheter in situ in right common femoral artery and vein
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2113-3-30**] 7:05 AM
IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of pulmonary edema and
effusions.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2113-3-30**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left  ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function  is mildly depressed
(ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to hypokinesis  of
the interventricular septum and apex. There is a mild resting
left  ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The gradient
increased with the  Valsalva manuever. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are  normal. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve  leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased
gradient  consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis
(preacceleration of flow in the  left ventricular outflow tract
may also be contributing to the elevated flow  velocity across
the aortic valve). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
annular  calcification. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial  mitral stenosis. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
Impression:
1. septal and apical hypokinesis
2. left ventricular hypertrophy
3. Mild-to-moderate left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
4. Minimal mitral stenosis (from severe annular calcification)
5. At least moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation
6. Possible minimal aortic stenosis

C.CATH Study Date of [**2113-3-31**]
COMMENTS:
1. Patent mid LAD stent.
2. Diagonal branch has no significant stenosis
3. Normal dominant LCX and RCA
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent mid LAD stent with no major stenosis in diagonal side
branch.
.
 ECHO Study Date of [**2113-3-31**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size  are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with  hypokinesis of basal and
mid-anterior septum. Right ventricular chamber size  and free
wall motion are normal. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There  is severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral  regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Focused study, showing mild regional left
ventricular systolic  dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate-to-severe mitral  regurgitation.
