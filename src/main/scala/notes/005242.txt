History of Present Illness:
Paraphrased from Dr.[**Name (NI) 9886**] office note:
This is an 83 woman who had her first attack of significant
cholelithiasis this past [**Month (only) 404**] and probably passed a stone at
that time, given her enzyme
elevations despite a subsequent MRCP indicating no common bile
duct stones.  She was very symptomatic.  Removing her
gallbladder is going to be complicated by her prior
gastrectomy in the [**2104**], but she understands the implications
of
this and whether or not it is going to preclude a laparoscopic
approach.  Nevertheless, because of her higher rate of recurrent
symptoms, she desires and will need her gallbladder removed.

Imaging:
ECHO [**2165-1-19**]: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

CTA [**2165-1-19**]:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli: Segmental embolus in the left
upper lobe
propagating into the anterior left upper lobe. Subsegmental
embolus in vessel supplying the right upper lobe.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, with atelectasis.
3. Patulous, fluid-filled esophagus, which may increase the
patient's risk of aspiration.
4. Postoperative changes in the cholecystectomy bed.
5. Healing rib fractures of the left ninth rib.

CXR [**2165-1-21**]: Continued low lung volumes. Blunting of both
costophrenic angles is seen with bibasilar atelectatic change.
There is some patchy opacification in the right mid and upper
lung zones.

CXR [**2165-1-22**]: Worsening opacification in the right upper and
middle lobes concerning for right upper and middle lobe
pneumonia. Worsened left basilar atelectasis compared to
[**2165-1-21**] may be secondary to worsening atelectasis or
pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.

CXR [**2165-1-23**]: The rapid progression of the parenchymal
abnormalities compared to [**1-16**] and [**2165-1-22**] are
consistent with rapid developing infection versus aspiration
(giving significantly dilated and fluid-filled esophagus on
chest CT from [**2165-1-19**]).

Chest ultrasound [**2165-10-23**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions are
seen.

CXR [**2165-1-24**]: Bilateral parenchymal opacifications have improved
since [**2165-1-23**]. Elevated hemidiaphragms likely
represent subpulmonic pleural effusions.

CXR [**2165-1-25**]: some progressive decrease in the bilateral
pulmonary opacifications

Pathology:
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:
1.  Acute and chronic cholecystitis.
2.  Cholelithiasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis. On [**2165-1-17**], the patient
underwent a laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy.  The
conversion was necessary due to dense adhesions.  Otherwise, the
operation went well without complication (reader referred to the
Operative Note for details). The patient stayed in the PACU
overnight for monitoring due to mild hypotension without
tachycardia.  She responded to fluids, and no pressors were
needed.  Her hematocrit was lower than preop value, and
subcutaneous heparin was held until hcts could be trended.  She
continued to have boots for DVT prophylaxis.  The patient
remained stable in terms of hct and SBP overnight, and she was
brought to the floor NPO, on IV fluids, and with a foley
catheter.

The patient was doing well until [**2165-1-19**], when she developed new
onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and
altered mental status.  She failed trials of IV lopressor and
diltiazem and was subsequently transferred to the ICU.  There,
she was put on an amiodarone drip.  A CTA performed at that time
demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli, including a segmental
embolus in the left upper lobe propagating into the anterior
left upper lobe and a subsegmental embolus in the right upper
lobe.  A heparin drip was started at this time.  Cardiology was
consulted, and they recommended continuing the amiodarone drip
until conversion to NSR and then discontinuing it.  They agreed
with the heparin drip and anticoagulation with coumadin for a
total of 6 months.  An ECHO showed no structural abnormalities,
and lower extremity dopplers were deferred due to patient
noncompliance.  The patient's PTT was difficult to get to goal;
she responded well when given one dose of FFP, and a diagnosis
of ATIII deficiency was made.  The heparin drip was continued at
the rate needed for a PTT of 60-80, and coumadin was started on
[**2165-1-20**].  The patient converted to NSR on [**2165-1-20**], and the
amiodarone drip was switched to a PO regimen.  She continued to
display intermittent episodes of altered mental status despite
trials of Haldol, and it was felt that she was sundowning.  By
[**2165-1-21**], the patient was more consistently oriented.  She
continued to improve until she reached her baseline mental
status, alert and oriented x 3 at all times.  Regarding the
patient's pulmonary status, she had been tachypneic and
desaturating on room air since the development of the pulmonary
emboli.  Serial chest xrays were performed, showing bilateral
pleural effusions (too small to tap), bibasilar atelectasis, and
patchy consolidation in the RUL and RML.  She was also
intermittently wheezy throughout.  Given her normal WBC and
absence of fever, antibiotics were deferred.  She improved on
supplemental oxygen, nebulizers, and lasix.  The supplemental
oxygen was weaned as appropriate, and her respiratory rate
normalized.

On [**2165-1-25**], the patient was transferred back to the floor.  Her
heparin drip was discontinued, as her INR was newly
supratherapeutic.  Her coumadin dosage was modified
appropriately, and the INR decreased to therapeutic levels.

The patient continued to do well on the floor.  She remained in
NSR, and her supplemental oxygen continued to be weaned.  Her
staples were removed, and her amiodarone was discontinued on
[**2165-1-28**].  She was seen by physical therapy, who felt that she
would do best with a [**Hospital 3058**] rehab stay due to
decondi
