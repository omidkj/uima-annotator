IMAGING:
CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC R
[**2144-12-7**]
1. Occlusion of inferior abdominal aorta with reconstitutions at
the common iliac arteries bilaterally.
2. Tapering of anterior tibial artery and peroneal artery on the
right at the level above the ankle and posterior tibial artery
stops abruptly at the level of the ankle on the right.
3. Left lower extremity vessels above the knee are small but
patent without evidence of a stenosis.
4. Left kidney is atrophic with a stent in the main renal artery

5. Number of hypodense lesions in the right kidney which are of
fluid
attenuation but has high standard deviation of attenuation
measurement,
therefore, evaluation with ultrasound is recommended.

CHEST (PA&LAT)
[**2144-12-7**]
Very minimal central pulmonary vascular engorgement. No focal
consolidation or pleural effusion.

ECG Study Date of [**2144-12-8**]  10:44:24 AM
Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing there is no significant
change.

ART DUP EXT UP BILAT COMP Study Date of [**2144-12-9**] 10:49 AM
IMPRESSION: Normal subclavian, axillary and brachial arteries
bilaterally,
normal triphasic waveforms.

ECG Study Date of [**2144-12-11**]  3:15:36 PM
Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2144-12-8**] no diagnostic interim change.

ECG Study Date of [**2144-12-12**]  10:18:28 AM
Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2144-12-11**] no diagnostic interim change.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-12-14**] at 3:08:45 PM      FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgical Service for
evaluation of gangrene, erythema, and infection of her bilateral
lower extremities. Patient found to have aorto-occlusive disease
on CTA and the patient underwent right axillary to bifemoral
bypass graft with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex graft on [**2144-12-10**], which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details).  In the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO
with IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter and
Dilauded PCA for pain control. The patient had an episode of
hypotension and hypoxia, the patient was admitted to the ICU for
careful observation.  Patient was ruled out for MI with
troponins x3 and EKG.  Cardiology was consulted and TTE was
performed showing normal cardiac function and EF>55%.  Patient
was continued on CPAP which patient uses at home for sleep
apnea.

Post op day 2, patient was transferred to the VICU and observed.
 Patient's pain was well controlled using a dilauded pca and
patient's diet was advanced.

Post op day 3 patient was dicontinued on all abx, continued on
PO coumadin and evaluated by PT/OT for disposition planning.

At the time of discharge on [**2144-12-17**], the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain
was well controlled. Patient will need INR carefully monitored
on a daily basis with coumadin dosed accordingly.  The patient
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
Patient will FU w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] as planned.
