History of Present Illness:
: 68M with h/o CVA, CAD, recent admit to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 59798**]) for
PNA and fevers, admitted to ICU from NH with recurrent fevers
and respiratory distress. He was noted to be tachypneic RR 30,
Temp 102, with cough and vomiting, O2 sat on RA 70%. His
previous hospital course was notable for hypothermia and no
evidence of PNA on CXR or other localizable source of infection
(blood, urine). Of note pt had completed a 7d course of
levo/flagyl in early [**Month (only) **] for RLL PNA, however, fevers resumed as
of [**2178-11-23**].Pt was treated with Zosyn intermittently. At NH
found to be febrile to 102 and referred to ED for further
management.
Upon arrival in ED, Tm 102, HR 117, 140/80, 30, 92% NRB. Pt
intubated with Versed 6mg sedation, Succinucholine 120mg,
Etomidate 20mg, for hypoxic respiratory distress. Pt received 3L
NS, Levo, and Flagyl for presumed PNA coverage.

[**2178-11-26**] CT ABD/Pelv:

fever.
2) Multiple noncalcified gallstones, without evidence of
cholecystitis.

diverticulitis.
4) Coronary artery calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68M with recent PNA admitted with sepsis and hypoxic
respiratory failure.
.
ICU course - The patient was admitted for sepsis, with the
sepsis protocol initiated. He had preserved BP on admission, and
responded to fluid boluses, not requirng any pressors during his
course. Most likely etiology is Pulm source of infection given
evidence of PNA on CXR and pt's increased risk (h/o CVA with
aphasia, PEG tube, dementia) though evidence of pyuria and
bacteruria on U/A could have been another source. His sputum on
[**12-8**] grew out Fluorquinolone-resistant E.coli, and his Bld cx
from [**12-7**] were 1/4 bottles + for coag negative staph His
antibiotics were Meropenem and Vancomycin. He had a CT
abd/pelvis and sinuses that were unremarkable for infectious
etiology. Despite adequate antibiotic therapy, he continue to
spike fevers.
He was also initially intubated for hypoxic resp failure
secondary to his PNA. He began to have worsening secretions and
an increased oxygenation requirement on the ventilator due to
increasing fluid overload and worsening PNA. His repsiratory
status continued to worse despite adequate diuresis to keep him
negative.

The patient continued to decline clinically during his hospital
course, requiring more oxygenation while on the ventilator and
having persistent fevers despite current antibiotic regimen.
Goals of care were addressed with his family members, notably
with his daughter, who decided to become the patient's surrogate
decision-maker as other family members did not wish to do so.
Given his poor prognosis and liklihood of failure to wean from
the vent, a decision was made by his daughter to extubate the
patient and make him as comfortable as possible. All of his
other family members were aware of the decision and also felt
that the patient was suffering too much. The was discussed in
detail with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The patient was started on a
Morphine gtt for comfort measures, and passed away on [**2178-12-18**].
