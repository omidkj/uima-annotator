Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) 13241**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 69 y.o. Spanish-speaking male with multiple
myeloma, ESRD on HD, history of right PICA CVA, HTN who presents

with worsened mental status per his family members.  Apparently
he was doing fine 1 day prior to admission.  Of note he received
chemotherapy (cytoxan) on [**2130-7-3**] and his blood counts are
decreasing.  He is overall a poor historian despite use of a
Spanish interpreter on the phone.
.
He did make it to [**Date Range 13241**] today on his own, but was
slightly confused there and sent home from HD by taxi.  His son
then brought him to [**Name (NI) **] because he "wasn't acting right."
Initial VS in the ED: T 97.3, BP 173/76, HR 104, 87%RA, up to
100% 3L NC.  Emperically given vanco/ceftriaxone for possible
infection.  He does not complain of respiratory symptoms (cough,
SOB).  His temperature subsequently went up to 100.6 in the ED.
CT head negative for acute process.  CXR negative.  CTA chest
pursued given his h/o PE (although INR 6.0), and revealed RUL
consolidation consistent with pneumonia.  Azithromycin also
given to cover atypical organisms.  Blood cultures drawn prior
to antibiotics.  In addition his serum calcium was 12.2 (has h/o
hypercalcemia of malignancy) and he was given 500cc bolus of
normal saline only given his h/o [**Name (NI) **] failure on HD.  Troponin
elevated at his baseline given his ESRD.
.
While in ED, his SBP rose into the 200s when he was aggitated
waiting for CT scan and other tests.  This was not treated given
concern for possibility he may decline clinically and become
septic.  The SBP come down to 180 spontaneously after the
studies.
.
ROS: Denies chest pain, SOB, cough, chills, abdominal pain, N/V.
 Does admit to "total body pain" which on further
characterization seems to be muscle pain, predominately in the
legs and head.  He admits to chronic leg pain at baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 69 y.o. man with multiple myeloma and ESRD on
[**Known lastname 2286**] who presented with altered mental status and was found
to have a right upper lobe pneumonia and hypercalcemia.
.
# RUL pneumonia.  The patient was found to have a right upper
lobe pneumonia on CT scan.  He was treated with vancomycin,
zosyn, and azithromycin for hospital acquired PNA.  He was
hypoxic on admission.  His O2 requirement worsened in the
setting of volume overload.  Pt had rigors and low grade temps
on HD2.  Blood and sputum cultures were negative.  A
bronchoscopy was performed on [**7-24**] and the BAL was negative.  He
was discharged breathing comfortably on room air.
.
# hypercalcemia/ altered mental status: The patient's altered
mental status likely due to a combination of his infection
(pneumonia) and metabolic derangements (hypercalcemia).  The
patient's hypercalcemia was thought to be secondary to his
multiple myeloma.  He has been on weekly pamidronate.  He was
treated with pamidronate, calcitionin, decadron, and [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] to
decrease his calcium level.
.
# right back pain: The patient developed excruciating right back
pain during this admission.  Multiple imaging modalities were
negative for any pathological fractures, but there was a
question of left sided ilio-psoas bursitis which did not
correlate with his clinical presentation.  His pain was managed
with Dilaudid throughout his admission.  He was transitioned to
oral Dilaudid prior to discharge.
.
# End-stage [**Month/Year (2) 2793**] Disease: The patient is on HD with ESRD
secondary to his multiple myeloma.  The [**Month/Year (2) **] team was consulted
and the patient was treated with HD during this hospitalization.
 The patient is basically anuric so his hypercalcemia and volume
status was dependent on HD.  The patient had to undergo HD daily
in order to manage his hypercalcemia.
.
# Pancytopenia: The patient was supported with blood
transfusions during this hospitalization.  He was transfused to
keep his hematocrit greater than 25.  He also receives epogen at
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**].
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been anticoagulated for
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. He was in sinus rhythm on
admission.  The patient was supratherapeutic on admission.  His
INR was 6.0.  He was reversed with Vitamin K and anticoagulation
was held as patient was thought to be at high risk of bleeding
given his likely uremic platelets.  Of note, the patient had a
history of PE in [**9-2**], but completed a 6 month treatment course
with warfarin and repeat CTA was negative for residual clot.  It
was decided that the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the
benefits at this point and it was discontinued.
.
# Hypertension:  The patient's antihypertensive medications were
initially held due concern that he might be developing sepsis
physiology; however, he developed HTN with SBP 200.  His
metoprolol was restarted and he was treated with hydralazine IV
PRN.
.
# ST depressions:  The patient was noted to have ST depressions
on EKG most likely secondary to demand ischemia.  He did not
have any symptoms of chest pain or pressure.  His troponin was
elevated in the setting of [**Date Range **] failure and missed [**Date Range 2286**],
but his CK was flat.
.
# Multiple myeloma:  The patient has end stage multiple myeloma.
 His was treated with Cytoxan on [**2130-7-3**] in an effort to help
control his disease and hypercalcemia.  He was started on
Rituxan as an inpatient and will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**]
(oncology) for further treatment.  Orthopedic oncology was
consulted and it was determined that no intervention for his
back pain would be indicated at this time.
