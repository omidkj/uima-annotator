History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 42 yo woman with PMH significant for morbid obesity
with gastric bypass 3 years ago as well as HTN and
hyperlipidemia, who presents with acute leukemia.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] describes that she has been feeling unwell for the
past four weeks; she describes being in her normal state of
health before this. Four weeks ago she started developing pain
in her thighs that she describes as an achy, bony pain, with no
associated trauma or swelling. She saw her PCP who [**Name9 (PRE) 78036**]
increased ESR, decreased platelets and abnormal electrolytes and
recommended followup with Rheumatology. She was seen by a
Rheumatologist who put her on a 10 day taper of Prednisone,
starting at 40 mg daily. Her pain did not improve with this
regimen and instead spread to her arms and lower back. She
visited the [**Hospital1 1474**] ED where she was discharged with Percocet
and instructions to followup with her rheumatologist. At a
subsequent Rheumatology visit her platelets were further
decreased. She was sent back to her PCP who referred her to
hematology for thrombocytopenia. Around this time (5 days prior
to admission) she also started to notice a L sided chest pain,
worse with taking deep breaths. She was unable to make an
appointment with hematology and so yesterday morning went to the
[**Hospital6 33**] ED. She denies fever, chills, difficulty
breathing, diarrhea or any other symptoms over the past few
weeks.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital3 **], she was found to have a CBC
significant for WBC 15.0 with 7% bands, 2% atypical lymphocytes.
Also ESR 113, LDH of 1600, indicating acute leukemia; she was
treated with allopurinol.
.
Chest CT showed multiple bilateral prominent axillary lymph
nodes and air trapping, ground glass opacities and
consolidations in the L lung. with largest in L axilla measuring
1.1 cm. She was evaluated by Infectious Disease who were
concerned for atypical PNA v. viral illness and gave her
Levaquin. She transiently desated to 86% on RA while walking to
the bathroom and was placed on nasal cannula. She was given
Percocet and Toradol for her leg pain. Vitals on transfer were
98.5 103 90/58 98% 2L.
.
On the floor, she is comfortable and not in pain. She is anxious
to initate diagnosis and possible treatment.

BONE MARROW [**2111-4-16**]:
PATHOLOGY:
BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE MONOCYTIC
LEUKEMIA (FAB M5).
CYTOGENETICS
Karyotype:
54,XX,+X,+1,[**Doctor Last Name **](1)t(1;16)(q11;p11),+3,+4,+8,+14,+20,+21[20]
20/20 cells show the hyperdiploid karyotype described
.
BONE MARROW [**2111-5-3**]:
Markedly hypocellular marrow with features consistent with
myeloablative chemotherapy effect
.
BONE MARROW [**2111-5-8**]
PATHOLOGY
Variably cellular, overall hypocellular bone marrow with
megakaryocytic clustering, left-shifted myelopoiesis and
increased blasts (see note).
.
Note:  Circulating blasts are seen in the peripheral blood (7%).
 The aspirate is paucispicular, however increased blasts and
monocytic precursors are noted. The core biopsy is variably
cellular with trilineage hematopoiesis, megakaryocytic
clustering and left shifted myelopoiesis. By immunostaining CD34
immunoreactive blasts are increased (~10% of cellularity),
however are present singly without clusters. CD117 highlights
early myeloid precursors in clusters comprising 30% of marrow
cellularity. Overall, the morphologic differential includes
regenerating marrow versus residual disease and correlation with
cytogenetic findings is recommended
