History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46yM who presents for evaluation of progressive
SOB. He first noticed his SOB approximately 3 years ago, however
it was minimal at that time. He reports that he was still able
to perform all of his daily activities, work in contruction and
interact with his children at that time but did notice some
dyspnea with exertion.  He was seen by a multitude of
pulmonologists who performed a variety of PFT's and he was
treated for asthma/COPD with inhalers.  He reports that his
symptoms continued to get worse while on this regimen.
Approximately 3 months ago, his symptoms became much more severe
and he can no longer walk up stairs, go to the gym or play with
his children.  He has had to stop working.
.
Mr [**Known lastname **] then came for follow up after having a stent trial for
TBM.  Stent was placed 5 days ago and he feels that "he was born
again".  He can walk on the street in the open air which he has
not done in a while.  His cough is better, in addition, he has
much less secretions. No fevers, still has some sore throat. He
is on prednisone 10mg daily, which he has been on for a while.
Due to his great response to an airway stent trial. The thoracic
surgery team planned to proceed with stent removal and posterior
tracheobronchoplasty.

IMAGING & STUDIES:
------------------
OR PATHOLOGY [**2174-3-23**]: Clinical Diagnosis: Tracheobronchomalasia.
.
CXR POST-OP [**2174-3-23**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
patient has undergone tracheobronchoplasty. An endotracheal tube
is in situ. The tip of the tube locates 6.5 cm above the carina
and could be advanced by 1-2 cm. Areas of atelectasis in the mid
right lung and at the left lung base. The lower part of the
trachea appears slightly narrowed. Borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette. No e
