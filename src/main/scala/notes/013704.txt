Chief Complaint:
chills, low grade temp

Femoral CVL
Removal of Femoral CVL

History of Present Illness:
61 year old female with T1DM s/p pancreatic transplant [**2173**],
CABG, prior NSTEMIs, CHF, ESRD with failed renal transplants and
now on peritoneal HD, CHF, orthostatic hypotension on midodrine
and fludrocortisone, presented to ED with chills, low grade temp
and poor temperature who was noted to be hypoxic and
hypotensive. Upon review of her records, she is always
hypotensive and she is very at her baseline upon present.

Of note, she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in [**2182-5-24**], at which
point an immunologic workup was performed, revealing CD4
lymphopenia. She had normal IgA and IgM as well as IgG levels at
that time. She was started on pneumocystis prophylaxis as well
as [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis and reported negative HIV testing at the
rehab center. She was seen by ID on [**9-24**] at which point she was
switched from pentamidine to mepron for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]
(**verify with pt). Her CD4 count was rechecked and found to be
165.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.8 70 85/60 22 98%. Labs were
notable for normal CBC and chem7 except for Cr of 6.1 (at
baseline). CXR was notable for no acute process. She was started
on vanc, levo, and flagyl for presumed septic process. She was
noted to have a temp of 101.4. She also got tylenol for fever
and levophed for hypotension to the 60s systolic. A right
femoral CVL was placed. Vitals on transfer: 77 86/49 16 99%.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her vitals were 106/57, 85, 97% on 3L.
The pt reports that last night she began shivering incessantly
and had a low grade temp of 99 (she normally runs 96-97). She
has also been feeling very drowsy and weak. In the ED, they were
having to tell her to take her medications multiple times before
she would finally respond. She denies pain anywhere except for
her sacrum, which is baseline. She frequently has diarrhea with
on and off positive C.diff cultures. She reports that her last
c. diff infection was 6-8wks ago. She did have diarrhea about 2
nights ago, but it was mainly loose, soft stool - nothing like
her normal c. diff diarrhea. She took an immodium and it
resolved like usual. She is not having and chest or abdominal
pain or trouble breathing. No dizziness or lightheadedness, just
weakness. In addition, this morning she was nauseated but did
not vomit.

She feels that her blood pressure may be low because the rehab
facility took off too much fluid during peritoneal dialysis.

IMAGING

[**10-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion with overlying
atelectasis, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.

[**10-17**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral, as well as
distal septal akinesis. There is mild hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 25-30%). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular
ring appears well seated with normal gradient. Moderate to
severe (3+) transvalvular mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe
regional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w
multivessel CAD. Well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring with
moderate to severe residual regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Pleural effusions. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2182-9-3**], mitral regurgitation is more
prominent (may be seconda
