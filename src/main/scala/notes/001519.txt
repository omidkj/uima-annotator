Brief Hospital Course:
Per history from the nursing home the patient had an aspiration
event and which was followed by severe respiratory problems. [**Name (NI) **]
was started on Flagyl, cetriaxone, levaquin for aspiration
pneumonia but did not respond to the regimen. The pt was then
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department where he presented
with fever to 104.2, tachpneia, hypoxemia and dehydration.
Patient was found to have bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on
CXR and was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn for broad coverage.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was found to be hypoxic and
hypercarbic which was attributed to a severe pneumonia together
with a component of mild CHF. As the patient did not improve
under therapy with Zosyn and Vancomycin, Vancomycin was switched
to Linezolid for better lung penetration. Zosyn was continued in
the setting of respiratory failure with a precipitating
aspiration event although sputum cultures were only positive for
MRSA. All blood cultures were negative. The patient was also
diuresed mildly for possible CHF. The pt' respiratory status
continued to deteriorate despite aggressive therapy and he
required 100% on a NRB mask in addition to oxygen by nasal
canula. He was uncomfortable, tachycardic and tachypneic. The pt
was hard to approach as his level of understanding was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] did not follow commands when he was addressed by a
translator. He became agitated when invasive procedure, such as
blood draws, were performed. His understanding of the necessity
of these procedures was unclear. His agitation was initially
controlled with Haldol but Haldol had to be stopped as it lead
to a prolongation of the QT interval. As the patient became more
and more tachypneic and uncomfortable, control of is agitation
was only possible with increasing doses of morphine and
lorazepam, which surpressed his respiratory drive further. He
required frequent suctioning which led to further agitation. As
the pt was DNR, DNI intubation was not an option. The family as
well as the legal guardian were approached and were explained
the severity of his condition. It was explained that aggressive
treatment and comfort of the pt were not compatible and the
family as well as the legal guardian agreed on having the pt on
comfort measures only. Abx were withdrawn an the pt was made
comfortable with a Morphin-drip and Ativan. A scopolamine patch
was applied to decrease respiratory secretions. The patient
expired on [**2136-10-6**].
