Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male with
a history of known coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction times two and history of diabetes
mellitus who was admitted the morning of [**2192-2-13**]
with substernal chest pain radiating to his neck.  Patient
ruled in for non-ST segment elevation MI with troponins
greater than 50 and CKs peaking at 461 on [**2-14**] at 8
PM.

The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization on the 14th
and was found to have three vessel disease diffusely.  He was
found on hemodynamic measurements to have a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 33, PA pressure of 90/60 systolic
and a low cardiac index of 1.3.  While in the Cath lab he was
treated with heparin bolus, Dobutamine drip at 5 mcg an hour,
Lasix at 180 mg IV, Natrecor and Nitrodrip for his pump
failure.  These interventions improved his hemodynamics
moderately giving him a PA pressure of 45/26, an index from
1.3 up to 1.5 and a PA saturation from 36 to 52.

At this point, the patient was transferred to the CCU for
further management of his pump failure and post MI state.  On
arrival to the CCU, the patient had no complaints of chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, back pain.  He did
complain of some posterior neck pain especially when he
flexed his neck.  He had no lower extremity loss of sensation
or groin pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post MI times two.  The
patient had received his previous cardiac care by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**],
phone # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2258**] at the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  He did have a
recent catheterization at the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital which has
also showed three vessel disease.  Patient had been evaluated
at the [**Hospital6 1708**] and thought not to be a
candidate or coronary artery bypass graft at that time.  The
patient did have an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 956**] of last year
that showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45%.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.

Findings consistent with pump failure, three vessel disease
and pulmonary hypertension.

EKG:  Pain free shows normal sinus rhythm at 94 with Q waves
in II, III and aVF, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation V4, V5, large R wave in
V2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 82-year-old male with a history
of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with known
three vessel disease, MI times two admitted with non ST
segment elevation MI.  Known three vessel disease was
confirmed by cardiac catheterization here without PCI
performed.  The patient shown to be in pump failure during
cardiac catheterization.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease / three vessel
disease by catheterization today.  Question reassessment for
candidacy for coronary artery bypass graft versus selective
PCI.  Patient was given 18 hours worth of Integrilin,
continued on aspirin and his statin.  Beta blocker was held
in the setting of pump failure and Dobutamine.  His heparin
was switched to Lovenox as no intervention was planned for
today.  He was continued on a Nitrodrip for angina control.
His CK MB fractions peaked at 56 at 8 AM on [**2-14**] and his CKs
peaked at 461 at 8 PM on the same date.  Troponins were
greater than 50.

PUMP:  Patient found to be in congestive heart failure during
cardiac catheterization hemodynamic monitoring.  He improved
status post Dobutamine / diuresis / Nitroglycerin / Natrecor.
He was negative 1.5 liters on the night of the 14th.  The
goal after that is to keep him even on ins and outs.  He is
saturating well on four liters by nasal cannula.  His chest
x-ray did look improved as well after the above treatment.
He was weaned off his Dobutamine on the 15th.  His blood
pressures were in the 90s off of the Dobutamine with a pulse
of 80.  O2 saturations remained at 96% on four liters by
nasal cannula.

Echocardiogram was performed on [**2192-2-15**].  This shows a
mildly dilated left atrium, left ventricular wall thickness
and cavity size are normal.  There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the entire
inferior wall, hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum,
lateral and anterior walls, akinesis of the apex.  There is
no aneurysm or thrombus seen.  RV chamber size is normal.
The aortic leaflets are normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is trace AR seen, 1+ MR, no effusion.  Ejection
fraction was calculated at 25 to 30%.

The patient was not on an ACE inhibitor and will defer to
outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] for a question of starting
ACE inhibitor.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  Patient EKG on [**2-15**] showed normal
sinus rhythm with similar Q wave and ST changes as in
previous days.  EKG except now with a right bundle branch
block with QRS of 126 milliseconds.  Patient has an EKG
showing similar right bundle branch block from [**2191-6-1**].  The
rate when in regular rate and rhythm is 96 beats per minute.
The rate of his previous EKG not in block was 94 making rate
related changes less likely.  The patient h
