Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Status post cardiac arrest with intracardiac defibrilator shock
x9

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year old woman with hx of mixed cardiomyopathy
with EF 20-25% s/p AICD placement, CAD s/p PCI to RCA, diabetes,
hypertension and afib on warfarin. She presented from nursing
home s/p fall out of bed after which she hit her head. She
reportedly vomited shortly thereafter. Nursing home staff put
her back into bed, and she was later noted to be unresponsive.
Nursing home staff felt she had no pulses and initiated chest
compressions; however, when EMS arrived, patient was noted to
have pulses. EMS intubated patient at the scene and sent her to
outside hospital, where she had Head CT negative for bleed. She
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
.
[**8-26**]-admitted for N/V and RLQ pain at OSH, found to have E.coli
sepsis [**3-17**] UTI, treated with Augmentin and d/c'ed amiodarone
during that admission. Of note, CT head w/o contrast was neg.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were as follows: 60 109/65 17 100%
vent: TV 500, rate 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%. Exam notable for being
combative, roving horizontal eye movements but not following
commands(on sedation). Labs notable for Hct 35.6, WBC 14,
troponin of 0.16, creatinine of 0.16 and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 31100**]. Blood gas
as follows: 7.52/41/391/35 on CMV(FiO2 100%, Vt 450cc, RR 14,
PEEP 5). EKG was significant for prolong QT.
.
She was noted to be hypotensive to 70 in the ED with wide
complex polymorphic tachycardia at 200 beats/min which
subsequently degenerated into ventricular fibrillation
terminated by ICD shock x 2. She again went into wide complex
tachycardia with no pulse requiring one round of CPR. She
underwent another similar episode requiring CPR and external
shock at 200 [**Doctor First Name **] with ROSC. She was started initially given
amiodarone bolus but was switched to lidocaine bolus + gtt with
concern for torsades from prolong QT vs ischemic polymorphic
wide complex tachycardia. She was given 2 grams of magnesium, 40
meq of potassium and transferred to CCU. Cardiac arrest/Cooling
team was not called per ED team as her cardiac arrest were brief
at OSH and here.
.
On the floor, she is intubated.

Studies
Admission EKG [**2123-9-8**]: A-V sequential pacemaker. It is likely
the pacemaker is set with a long P-R interval. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2112-7-4**] the rhythm appears to be
atrio-ventricular paced on the current tracing.

TTE [**2123-9-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The coronary
sinus is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
akinesis of the septal and inferior walls and global hypokinesis
of the remaining walls. The basal inferolateral wall is
relatively preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters
are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe regional
and global biventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation. Small to moderate circumferential
pericardial effusion. Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior report (images unable to be reviewed) of
[**2112-7-4**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
The pericardial effusion is larger.
.
CT Head w/o Contrast [**2123-9-8**]: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction. Ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and in configuration.  The mastoid air
cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
.
CXR AP [**2123-9-8**]: An endotracheal tube ends at the level of the
clavicular heads, 5.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube
ends with the tip just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
This tube could be advanced by 5-10 cm. Note is made of a
dual-lead pacer/AICD device. A left neck IV catheter is noted,
with the tip not positioned within any identifiable large
vessel. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and note is made of
a dense left lower lobe opacity. Note is also made of mild
pulmonary
vascular conge
