[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES:

CXR ([**2127-9-18**]): IMPRESSION: Patchy and linear opacities in the
right lower lobe with a nonspecific appearance, consistent with
either atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.

RUQ U/S ([**2127-9-18**]): IMPRESSION: Large stone impacted in the
gallbladder neck with appearance of the gallbladder highly
suggestive of cholecystitis.

BONE MARROW BIOPSY ([**2127-9-18**]): RESULTS: Three color gating is
performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast yield. B
cells are polyclonal, and do not express aberrant antigens. T
cells express mature lineage antigens and have a normal helper
cytotoxic ratio of 1.3 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0). Cell
marker analysis demonstrates two large distinct populations of
abnormal cells.  One population, identified within the "blast
gate," comprising 80% of gated (17% of total) bone marrow cells
expresses immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated
antigens CD33, 13, 11c, and 117, a small subset CD64 and CD71,
and lack CD4, 14, and 56. A second population (95% of gated, 40%
of total) expresses HLA-DR, CD33, and 13, along with 11c, 4, 14,
64, 71, and CD15 (subset), but lack CD34 and CD56.  In both
gates, cells lack T cell-associated antigens, and are CD10
negative. INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings consistent
with involvement by acute leukemia of myelomonocytic
differentiation.

CT ABD/PELV ([**2127-9-19**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Acute cholecystitis with
multiple small abscesses in the gallbladder fossa as well as
extending into the hepatic parenchyma consistent with a
contained perforation. Large stone in the fundus of the
gallbladder. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 2)
Massive lymphadenopathy involving the portahepatis, celiac
access region as well as the retroperitoneal in the upper
abdomen related to the patient's underlying disease. There is
mild adenopathy in the right paratracheal and subcarinal region.
3) Patchy opacities in both lungs which are likely infectious in
origin. 4) Hypodense lesions in the right kidney might represent
areas of pyelonephritis. 5) Cystic lesion in the upper pole of
the left kidney likely represents a complex cyst. This could be
further evaluated with ultrasound.

GALL BLADDER PATHOHISTOLOGY ([**2127-9-19**]): DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Gallbladder wall (A, B): a. Acute hemorrhagic gangrenous
cholecystitis and pericholecystitis. b.  Extensive infiltration
by malignant cells consistent with patient's known acute myeloid
leukemia; see diagnosis 3. 2. Gallbladder and contents (C): a.
Acute hemorrhagic gangrenous cholecystitis and pericholecystitis
with colonies of Gram (+) cocci on Gram stain (with satisfactory
control). b. Cholelithiasis. c. Extensive infiltration by
malignant cells consistent with patient's known acute myeloid
leukemia; see diagnosis 3. 3. Lymph node, root of mesentery (D):
Lymph node extensively infiltrated by acute myeloid leukemic
cells with features highly suggestive of acute myelomonocytic
leukemia with abnormal eosinophils (M4EO). NOTE:  The malignant
cells are negative for L-26 and CD3 and positive for CD43. This
profile is consistent with a myeloid phenotype of the malignant
cells. Some of the reagents used in these assays may not be
approved for diagnostic use.

ECHO/TTE ([**2127-9-26**]): Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic ttricuspid valve is present. The gradients are
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

ERCP ([**2127-10-6**]): IMPRESSION: Leak of contrast in the region of
the cystic duct in this patient status post cholecystectomy.

CT ABD/PELV ([**2127-10-9**]): IMPRESSION: 1. No significant interval
change in the perihepatic fluid collections, some of which
contain air. Additionally, there is no interval change in the
appearance of the fluid tracking along the right colic gutter
and through the subcutaneous tissues, consistent with the
patient's history of biliary cutaneous fistula. 2. Peripheral,
ill-defined, nodular appearing, bilateral lower lobe opacities,
some of which are new and
