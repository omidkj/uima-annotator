Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  64 yo M w/ HIV, ESRD on HD, DM p/w SOB.

1: SOB-Patient underwent hemodialysis on [**12-25**] with removal of
4L fluid. At that time he had oxygen saturations of 98% on NRB.
The following morning on [**12-26**] the patient appeared lethargic,
with worsening bilateral infiltrates on CXR and low PO2 on ABG
while on NRB. He was initially placed on BiPAP but still
appeared fatigued, and unable to support his own breathing.  He
was therefore emergently intubated. While intubated, he was
hemodialyzed with removal of another 4L of fluid.  He was
extubated the evening of [**12-26**] and had adequate oxygen
saturations on 4l NC. He did not develop further dyspnea after
extubation and was transferred to the floor.  On [**12-28**] the
patient had a third session of dialysis after which he had no
further supplemental oxygen requirement.  He had no evidence of
infection during this hospitalization and his lungs were clear
to ausculatation at the time of discharge.
.
2. Mental Status: Patient was found to be lethargic in setting
of hypoxia on morning of [**12-26**]. he was emergently intubated, and
extubated that same evening. His mental status has returned to
baseline, as he is alert and oriented X3 since extubation.
.
3. ESRD: cont HD as per schedule, as above.  His next HD should
be [**12-30**].
