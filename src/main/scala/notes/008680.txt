Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85 yo F with a past medical history of afib, avr/mvr, SSS s/p
pm, CHF presents with altered mental status. History obtained
from family as patient is altered at the time of his exam.
Patient lives in an attached apartment with her son [**Name (NI) **], and
has reportedly been more fatigued over the last 2 days.
Yesterday she was found going to sleep at 4pm, which is
apparently unlike her. This morning, she was found ironing while
in a seated position, which is apparently unlike her because she
generally enjoys ironing and always stands up. Throughout this
time, patient had been interactive, lucid and with baseline
mental status. She was reporting some mild dyspnea, and a horase
voice, but denied dysuria, chest pain, palpitations, and
syncope. Family reports poor po intake over the last several
weeks, and that patient has been overall discouraged with need
for two hospitalizations in the last 6 weeks.
.
In the ER, patient was found to have oxygen saturation of 68% at
triage and was brought back to the ED core. She was placed on
Bipap and was initially agressive, but became progressively more
somnolent. CXR, per ED interpretation, was concerning for right
sided consolidation. EKG was reportedly at baseline. Family
decided to make patient DNR/I, with decision to treat with
antibiotics, but without central lines, pressors or invasive
procedures. Patient received 1 L NS, Vancomycin 1 g IV x1, Zosyn
4.5 g IV x1, and Vitamin K 10 mg IVx1 for an elevated INR at 12.
On transfer, VS were 113/47, 48, 100% on Bipap 12/5 with an FiO2
100%.
.
In the ICU, patient is sedated and only grimaces to verbal and
mechanical stimuli.

Radiology:
CXR ([**2126-6-2**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Increased regions of consolidation in the right lung, which
may indicate infection. Followup chest radiograph after
appropriate therapy is indicated to exclude underlying pulmonary
mass.
2. Stable severe cardiomegaly.

CT Head ([**2126-6-2**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. Specifically, no acute
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.

Echo ([**2126-6-3**]) - The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
right atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
[The amount of regurgitation present is normal for this
prosthetic aortic valve.] A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal functioning mitral and aortic valve
mechanical prostheses. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-2-23**], left ventricular
systolic function has improved and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now lower.
.
Portable CXR [**2126-6-7**]:
Compared with earlier the same day, there ay be mild increase in
the degree of vascular plethora. Otherwise, I doubt significant
interval change. Again seen is bibasilar collapse/consolidation.
Pacemaker with tip in enlarged RV and prosthetic heart valve
noted.
.
ECG [**2126-6-7**]:
Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation is probably due to left
anterior
fascicular block but consider also possible prior inferior
myocardial
infarction. Probable prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
ST-T wave
abnormalities are non-specific. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2126-6-2**] axis appears
further leftward and delayed R wave progression is more
prominent.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo F with a past medical history of afib, avr/mvr, SSS s/p
pm, CHF who presented with fatigue, was found to have hypoxia to
68% at triage, and progressively worsening mental status in the
ER.
.
#. Pneumonia: Patient with R infiltrate on CXR with relative
leukocytosis and recent AMS which may secondary to
infection/PNA. Initially treated broadly with vanco/zosyn and
then narrowed to CAP treatment with CTX/Azithro. She was placed
on BiPAP, given her hypercapnia and poor respiratory status.
However, ultimately BiPAP was stopped [**1-8**] facial skin breakdown.
Given the patient's poor clinical appearance at that time, her
antibiotics were broadened back to HCAP and aspiration PNA
coverage, with vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro. Ultimately, the
patient's clinical status improved,
