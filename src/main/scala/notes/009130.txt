Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
At admission: The patient is a 70M with gallstone pancreatitis
who then underwent a failed ERCP which led to abdominal
compartment syndrome after insufflation. This was further
complicated by vasodilatory SIRS shock with subsequent
decompressive exploratory laparotomy ([**2113-7-3**]) w/ persistent
open abdomen, expansion of wound ([**2113-7-3**]), a bleeding
Dieulafoy's ulcer s/p clipping ([**2113-7-17**]), acute renal failure,
ARDS and c.diff, abdominal closure and repeat decompressive ex
lap ([**2113-7-19**]), tracheostomy ([**2113-7-24**]), partial closure of
abdomen with mesh ([**2113-7-29**]) and wound Vac ([**2113-8-1**]). Repeatedly
febrile, repeat abd CT shows air in pancreas. now s/p drainage
of pancreatic collection by IR ([**2113-8-13**]) upsizing of drain
([**2113-8-18**]), laparoscopic minimally invasive pancreatic
necrosectomy ([**2113-8-22**], [**2113-8-28**], [**2113-9-4**]) for necrotizing
pancreatitis.

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 35199**] is a 70M who presents complaining of severe RUQ pain
since last evening.  He states that he had similar pain 4 nights
ago that only lasted for a few hours and then resolved, was not
associated with nausea or vomiting.  Then last evening a few
hours after dinner he felt the pain return, severe and diffuse
upper abdomen, progressing to more diffuse abdomen and raditaing
across his back.  He says he had mild nausea without emesis, no
chest pain or shortness or breath.  Last bowel movement was last
evening after the pain had started, normal, no blood, no
diarrhea.  Can not say if he has passed gas.  Otherwise has not
had this before, no history of gallstones.

Pertinent Results:
[**2113-7-1**] CT abd - acute pancreatitis
[**2113-7-2**] - ERCP - Failed CBD cannulation due to duodenal edema

Multiple CT abdomen/pelvis consistent with pancreatitis
Multiple CT head for mental status changes demonstrating no
evidence of acute hemorrhage, Chronic small vessel infarction,
Mucosal sinus disease

[**2113-9-19**] - Fistulagram -  Spontaneous passage of contrast from
the peripancreatic collection into the descending colon near the
splenic flexure, consistent with fistula.

Speech and swallow evalutation [**2113-10-9**] - Continue PMV use as
tolerated throughout the day.  PO sips of nectar thick liquid
with alternative means for primary hydration/nutrition. Meds via
alternative means.  Q4 oral care
1:1 supervision with sips to carefully monitor 02 sats, suction
when needed, and maintain aspiration precautions

Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-2**]: [**Hospital Ward Name **] for ERCP, aspiration mid-procedure so
intubated. Unsuccessful ERCP, difficulty passing NG tube.
Excessive air causing compartment syndrome of abdomen. Taken to
OR for Abd compartment syndrome from air insufflation. Target
bladder pressure <26 (43 on admission to SICU).

[**7-3**]: Ex-lap, enterotomy for abd decompression. Due to worsening
abd distension, hemodynamic instability the abd wound was
extended at the bedside in the ICU by the surgical team and
packed open with bogata bag and sponges. CO improved and pressor
requirements decreased post op. Worsening renal failure.

[**7-4**] - UOP steady at 10cc/hr but massively retaining fluids,
BUN/cr rising. CVVH started, transient tachycardia limited vol
off. PEEP decreased to 18. LFTs, panc enzymes improving.

[**7-5**]: fixed OG tube. Line rewired and CVVH initiated. Plan OR in
weekend for closure. Off pressors. Panc enzymes cont improve.
Improving static compliance to vent. Fibrinogen 1028

[**7-6**]: Vanco D/c'd, bladder balloon D/C'd. TPN initiated.

[**7-7**]: goal net 4 L negative w/ HD. Continues on CVVH. PEEP
decreased 10->8. TPN day 2 (hole in bag, got premix instead).
WBC 9.5->12.8, afebrile, cultures sent. NGT replaced.

[**7-8**]: TPN day 3, to OR for washout + dressing change + partial
closure, ABD still open, continue HD goal 4L negative

[**7-9**]: DC cis atracurium. TPN day 4. Plan OR [**7-11**]. started Fluc.
Slowed rate due to hypotension. Primary did not want start
pressors. ? desat to 88% whle on 40%/[**8-18**]. Responed Fio2 100%.
Wean down to FiO2 60%. [**7-8**] Sputcx: yeast w/ aspergillus

[**7-10**]: fem aline and RIJ CVL removed.  Vanc/Zosyn restarted d/t
fevers, rigors, increasing WBC.  restarted neo gtt for
hypotension.

[**7-11**]: Bronch, mucus plugs suctioned from RML, RLL. KOH prep of
BAL - no aspergillus, BAL for viral neg.

[**7-12**]: cdiff+, started po vanco, flagyl, dc vanco, zosyn. OR [**Doctor First Name **].
Plan to resite line if wbc still elevated in am. Peep 10>8

[**7-13**]: closed in OR

[**7-14**]: Hemodialysis catheter sent, Bronch and BAL washing sent,
febrile to 102.7. Non-obstructive clot in the left lower
internal jugular vein

[**7-15**]: BAL w/ aspergillus. Off sedation, added fentanyl for pain
control. PEEP 12>10. Weaning neo. Hct 25.3>22.2. TTE: increased
