peroneal thrombectomy with patch angioplasty. Patient
underwent diagnostic arteriogram on that admission which
[**Year (4 digits) 3780**] right lower extremity occlusive disease with
high-grade stenosis at the proximal profunda and minimal
distal reconstruction. He returns now secondary to poor pain
control at home for possible intervention. He denies any
constitutional symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath or
dyspnea. He denies any acute changes in his rest pain
symptoms, although he has noted increased erythema of the
lower extremity. He now is admitted for definitive treatment.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  VITAL SIGNS: 98.6, 59, 18, blood pressure
110/20, O2 97% on room air. General appearance is alert,
oriented male in no acute distress. HEENT exam is
unremarkable. Carotids are palpable 1+ without bruits. There
is no lymphadenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart
is a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
Abdominal exam is benign. Lower extremity exam shows mild
blanching and erythema with tenderness to palpation. There is
no ecchymosis. Pulse exam shows carotids are palpable 1+.
Radials are Dopplerable signals bilaterally. Femoral on the
right is 2+ palpable, on the left Dopplerable signal. On the
right, the popliteal is Dopplerable. The pedal pulses are
absent. The patient has left AKA. Rectal exam - prostate is
firm, enlarged. Guaiac negative stool. Neurologic exam is
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. IV fluids were begun. Patient was started on
Dilaudid for analgesia control. A stool for C. diff was sent.
Routine labs, EKG and chest x-ray obtained. Acute pain
service was consulted, and recommendations to begin Dilaudid
PCA. They continued to follow the patient during his
hospitalization until his initial surgery with adjustment in
his PCA dosing for adequate pain control. The patient was
continued on IV heparin with some improvement in his ischemic
pain. Foley was placed for urinary retention. Patient
proceeded to surgery on [**2129-4-12**] and underwent a right
common femoral-profunda bypass with ringed [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex graft.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in
the OR and transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
Postoperatively, the patient remained stable and was
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
His postoperative hematocrit was 25.8. He was started on
perioperative vancomycin. He was transfused for his
hematocrit. Postoperative day 2, his Dilaudid IV was
discontinued, and he was begun on tramadol 1-2 tablets q. 4
h. p.r.n. for pain with Tylenol 650 mg q. 6 h. around-the-
clock, and Neurontin was increased to 200 t.i.d. Dilaudid was
recommended only if tramadol did not provide adequate pain
control. Physical therapy saw the patient on [**2129-4-13**]
and recommended rehab therapy. Postoperative day 2, he
continued on his IV heparin. His foot looked dusky. PVRs were
obtained which showed extremely poor perfusion at all levels.
Heparinization was continued. Coumadinization was instituted.
He remained in the VICU.

Patient was transferred to the regular nursing floor on [**2129-4-14**]. The Foley was removed, but the patient failed to
void, and Foley was replaced on [**2129-4-17**]. Physical
therapy continued to work with the patient. On [**4-22**],
patient was prepared for surgery, after discussing with both
the patient and the family that he would require above-knee
amputation. His INR was 2.3 and required fresh frozen plasma
for reversal. He was also transfused for hematocrit of 24.3.
Post-transfusion crit was 28.4. Patient underwent a right
above-knee amputation on [**2129-4-22**]. He developed
postoperative hypotension with a rise in his troponin. EKG
was without any significant changes. The patient was
transferred to the SICU for continued monitoring and
vasopressive support. Patient was in congestive failure. IV
Lasix was begun. IV heparinization was instituted secondary
to evidence of MI by troponin levels. The patient was
intubated the following day because of hypoxia. Patient
remained intubated and underwent a diagnostic cardiac cath on
[**2129-4-25**] via the right brachial artery which
[**Year (4 digits) 3780**] main trunk stent was patent, the left anterior
descending with diffuse disease with a stenosis of 50%, the
left circumflex was totally occluded to the first obtuse
marginal, the right coronary artery was the dominant system
with an 80% stenosis in the PDA.

The patient continued to remain intubated. Tube feeds were
started on [**4-25**]. Patient developed rapid atrial
fibrillation on [**4-27**] which required amiodarone drip and
continued amiodarone conversion to oral medication. IV
heparinization was continued. On [**4-28**], the patient
continued in significant congestive heart failure requiring
continued IV Lasix. We could not wean the patient from the
vent. It was discussed with the patient's family, and the
patient was made DNR/DNI. Patient was then extubated. On
[**4-29**], he was transferred to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care. On [**5-1**], the patient remained in the
VICU. A-line was discontinued. Patient was made floor status
with telemetry. Patient continued on his tube feeds and oral
feedings. Rehab screening was begun. Patient will be
discharged when medically stable to rehab.

paroxetine 40 mg daily, Tamsulosin 0.4 mg capsules daily,
bisacodyl suppositories once daily p.r.n., hydromorphone 0.5
