Chief Complaint:
weakness/dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- [**9-13**]: Chamberlain procedure to biopsy para-aortic lymph nodes

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 68yo man with a h/o COPD, HTN, left lower
lobectomy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and pericardial effusion who
p/w 5-6 days of weakness and pleuritic chest pain and was found
to have multifocal pulmonary embolisms and multiple lytic bony
lesions.

He first began to feel unwell this past [**Month (only) 547**], when he was in
[**State 108**] and woke up one morning with shortness of breath
precipiated by minor exertion (5 steps) which he has never had
before.  No CP at the time.  He went to the emergency ER where
he was prescribed a Zpack.  After completing the course of
antibiotics, he did not feel better.  He saw his PCP who
prescribed another course of Azithromycin after which the pt
states his SOB resolved.  This [**Month (only) 205**], he felt unwell again and
had a temperature of 102F.  At that time, he did not have SOB.
He went to [**Hospital3 2737**] where he was prescribed a week long
course of Avelox and felt better.  Approximately 4 weeks ago, he
developed bilateral, stabbing chest pain.  The pain did not
radiate and was not accompanied by SOB or fever.  The pain was
worsened by lying flat and on the left side.  Patient unsure if
the pain was less severe with leaning forward. He went to his
PCP who referred him to a cardiologist.

He had an outpatient work up which included ECG, stress test and
TTE.  TTE on [**8-30**] demonstrated a pericardial effusion measuring
1.5-1.9cm posteriorly, 1.3-2.1cm anteriorly and 0.8-1.6 cm
behind the right atrium.  There was also severely decreased LV
systolic function with EF 25-30%.  The left atrium was
moderately dilated. Per cardiologist's request, patient was
admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**9-2**] for further work up
of pericardial effusion.  During hospitalization, he was started
on colchicine and prednisone and discharged home on a 21 day
prednisone taper.
.
The pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**9-9**] with 5-6 days of weakness,
loss of appetite, particularly in the morning.  He felt as
though he has the flu. In the ED, initial VS were: 99.0 48
144/88 24 94%. Patient complained of dyspnea and intermittent
sharp, stabbing chest pain w/ coughing or deep breathing, in
addition to generalized weakness. CXR showed post-surgical
changes in the left hemithorax, patchy opacity with interstitial
markings in the right lung base, suggestive of chronic COPD
changes with atelectasis, but no pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bedside echo showed trace pericardial effusion w/o evidence of
tamponade. Patient was walked and dropped ambulatory sat to 86%
and HR jumped to 140s. D-dimer sent and elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 15717**].
Patient underwent CTA which was positive for multifocal PEs,
LAD, lytic lesions and soft tissue mass in chest concerning for
metastatic disease. He was started on a heparin drip and was
admitted to the ICU for further work up. He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout ED stay.
.
In the ICU, pt denied SOB.  He reported bilateral CP, sharp,
stabbing and worse with deep breath, lying flat and lying on
left side.  He is unsure if the pain is better with leaning
forward.  He denies recent rhinorrhea, cough, fever, chills.  He
has had decreased appetite and endorses a 13 pound weight loss
in hte last 2-3 weeks.  He also has night sweats.  He has never
had a colonoscopy and does not want to have one.  He also
reports back pain which started 3-4 weeks ago.  The pain is
achy/nagging in nature and involves the mid back and lower back.
 The pain does not radiate and worsens with weight bearing.  He
has taken percocet which alleviates the pain. He also developed
left leg pain recently from the hip to the knee posteriorly that
is worse with weight bearing.  Patient denies weakness in
UEs/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] loss of sensation.  Denies urinary retention/fecal
incontinence.
.
Oncology was involved to guide management, and recommended
multiple imaging studies as well as a SPEP/UPEP for mildly
elevated calcium, which came back negative.  Bone scan was
performed and showed multiple lytic lesions including a large
one in the left femur, and also in the thoracic/lumbar spine,
pelvis, and ribs.  Further evaluation of the femur for ?
fracture was recommended, and the patient was seen by
orthopedics, who recommended X-rays of pelvis/femur.
Orthopedics stated that patient can be 50% weightbearing on LLE,
and patient needs to use a walker.  Thoracics was consulted for
need for tissue biopsy, and there was plan for a staged
procedure on the [**Hospital Ward Name **]; soft tissue biopsy will be tried
first, then mediastinoscopy, then VATS all during the same OR
case.  Patient has also had MRI of the brain which was limited
but with no obvious metastases seen.  PSA was checked and found
to be normal.
.
Vitals at the time of ICU callout were P 80-83  BP 111/79  Sat
96%2L.
On arrival to the medical floor the pt c/o central lower back
pain, [**6-4**], for which he requested pain medication.  On [**9-12**], he
was not currently dyspneic and reports no current chest pain.
He says that his back pain is currently well-controlled, and
that he looks forward to going home after his staging procedure.
