Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Exploratory laparotomy, resection terminal ileum and right
colon, exploration of aorta and mesenteric arteries
2. Abdominal aortogram, celiac stent, superior mesenteric artery
stent.
3. Second-look abdominal reexploration and resection of 188 cm
of nonviable small bowel.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old woman who presented on transfer
from an outside hospital with diarrhea, epigastric pain and a
35-pound weight loss over three months. Colonoscopy at the
outside hospital showed sigmoid stricture, a question of
ischemic colitis vs diverticulosis, and terminal ileum through
RT colon with superficial ulcers and dusky color. A CTA/MRA
showed 50% celiac axis/SMA stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an elderly female, transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2137-7-9**] with chronic mesenteric ischemia who had some worsening
bowel complaints and elevated white count. On evaluation in the
hospital, she started to have some diminished pain and had no
focal findings. She had diffuse mild tenderness but no rebound
and guarding. The decision was made to hydrate her, repeat a CT
scan and plan for semi-elective percutaneous mesenteric
revascularization and potential laparotomy.  However, over the
course of the night, her pain acutely worsened. The patient was
seen to have a white blood count of 30,000, a diffusely tender
abdomen and a sterile lactate of 8. Therefore, the patient was
taken urgently to the operating room on [**2137-7-10**].
Intraoperatively, there was seen to be an ischemic appearing
liver and diffuse ischemia of the small bowel. The only area of
transmural infarction that was visualized was an approximately 4
cm segment of the terminal ileum. The SMA was explored and was
circumferentially calcified as was the whole aorta. An attempt
at a bypass was not realistic because we would have had to come
from the supraceliac aorta at best and are arteries are
incredibly calcified. Therefore, the decision was made to close
the patient's abdomen, resuscitate her and then take her to the
endo suite for an attempt at percutaneous revascularization. She
was stabilized in the recovery room initially for approximately
an hour and a half and then transferred to the endo suite. Upon
transfer, she required more pressors. The patient had a cardiac
arrest during the procedure and required CPR, and medications
and transcutaneous pacing. Eventually, she regained her own
rhythm and had a blood pressure. One celiac artery stent and
superior mesenteric artery stent were deployed. The patient was
returned to the ICU in critical condition. There, the patient
remained in critical condition being dependent on vasopressor
support and high levels of mechanical ventilatory support.
Because of the fact that the patient had failed to clear her
lactic acidosis, the decision was made to reexplore the abdomen
to determine the viability of her remaining intraperitoneal
contents the very next day. Upon reexploration, 188cm of small
bowel were found to be non-viable and were therefore resected.
The patient's abdomen was closed, and she was returned to the
ICU, where she remained in profound shock requiring multiple
pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient developed renal
failure, hepatic failure and coagulopathy. CVVHD was instituted.
Following multiple meetings with family, the patient's grim
prognosis was made clear. After lengthy discussion, the
patient's family elected to make her comfort measures only on
[**7-12**] at 1:30am. She expired shortly after at 2:08am.
