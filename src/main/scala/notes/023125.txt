with headache. She came to the emergency room because she had a
headache and thought her BP must be elevated. She does not have
a h/o headaches and the last time she had a headache, her BP was
elevated so she felt it must be the case this time. Denies

In the ED, initial vitals were remarkable for SaO2 of 90% RA. Pt
denies SOB. HA resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin given by
EMS. HTN treated in ED with total of 15mg lopressor IV.
Ambulatory SaO2 was 90% RA. CXR (done b/c low O2 sat) showed new
large R pleural effusion, with possible air bronchograms (see
read below). Pt given levofloxacin and admitted for w/u of new
pleural effusion. Vitals on transfer vs temp 98 HR 67 BP 184/80

BP on the floor was 210/114, possibly due to anxiety. Pt given
lorazepam 0.5mg x1 and BP rechecked in both arms 30 min later.

although she was very uncomfortable when cuff inflated.

Images:
[**2126-7-23**] CXR: Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusion, right
more than left, with atelectasis of right lower lobe, right
middle lobe and left lower lobe.
.
EKG [**2126-7-23**]: NSR 66, nl PR, QRS, nl axis, Q in III, TWI in AVL,
T-wave flattening in aVR and V5, J-point elevations in V2 and V3
- all unchanged from [**2125-9-30**].
.
[**2126-7-24**] CT Head: No evidence of acute process, and no change
since [**2125-7-23**].
.
[**2126-7-24**] Head CT IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute process, and no
change since [**2125-7-23**].
.
[**2126-7-25**]: MRI head prelim: Multifocal regions of acute embolic
infarcts, predominantly within posterior circulation on the
right and also involving the anterior circulation suggesting a
proximal source.
.
[**2126-8-2**] L-spine: No previous images. Mild scoliosis convex to
the left, most likely positional. Narrowing with spurring and
sclerosis involving multiple intervertebral disc spaces,
consistent with widespread degenerative change. Of incidental
note is calcification in the aorta.
.
[**2126-8-2**] Bilateral hip: Three views of each hip show no evidence
of fracture or dislocation. No substantial degenerative change
is appreciated.
.
[**2126-8-3**] CXR Portable: Currently, the patient is in improved, but
still present pulmonary edema with bibasilar consolidations and
bilateral pleural effusions. The consolidation may represent
areas infection as was previously suggested, but also may be a
combination of infection and atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:

now resolved and hypertensive urgency, found to have new embolic
posterior strokes, oxygen requirement and bilateral pleural
effusions.
