History of Present Illness:
84 year old woman with hx of CAD s/p stenting, COPD (02
dependent), PAfib, recent DVT and multiple admissions for
pneumonia since [**2198-11-27**] for shortness of breath presenting
from nursing home with hypoxia.  The patient was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2199-3-1**] following being admitted on
[**2199-2-13**] for pneumonia.  Prior to that she had been discharged to
rehab on [**2199-2-6**] to complete a course of abx (which completed on
[**2199-2-11**]). During that admission she was found to have a DVT.
She was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2199-2-13**] with shortness of breath,
weakness, and poor PO intake.  She was found a low grade temp
and had a chest xray that showed atelectasis and residual
pneumonia.  Her course was complicated by acute on chronic renal
failure with Cr upto 2.5. A right PICC line was placed for
access.

On the evening of [**2199-3-4**] she was noted to be moaning.  Vital
signs at that thime were notable for T(tympanic) 99.3 HR 87
143/40 88%2L NC.  She received nebs, tylenol, KCl (for
hypokalemia), ativan, metoprolol, and isordil prior to transfer
to the ED.  Per the patient's daughter, the patient had not been
coughing or choking on food recently but did have temporary
swallowing difficulties during her most recent admission at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Also of note, the

In the ED she was 100.3 96  116/41  22  95%NRB. She had a CXR
that showed RLL infiltrate and RML collapse.  She received
vanc/zosyn.  Per discussion with the patient she reversed her
DNR/DNI status.  She was admitted to the ICU.

CXR: [**2199-3-5**] 7am
CXR - The study is markedly limited by patient rotation. The
cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are difficult to evaluate.
The right mid and lower lung are somewhat obscured by overlying
mediastinal structures due to rotation; there is right lower
lobe atelectasis. In the visualized right upper lung and left
lung, no consolidation is appreciated. There may be bilateral
costophrenic angle blunting. A right-sided PICC line tip is not
well visualized, but at least extends to the SVC.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2199-3-5**] 2:37 PM
Reason: eval for [**Hospital 78194**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman with pneumonia and probable RML collapse
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for re-expansion
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest AP portable single view.
INDICATION: History of pneumonia and probably right middle lobe
collapse. Evaluate for re-expansion.
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in sitting semi-upright position and analysis is
performed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study
obtained approximately ten hours earlier. The on previous
examinations ([**3-4**] and [**3-5**]) identified PICC line appears
in unchanged position and terminates overlying the SVC at the
level 1 cm below the carina. No pneumothorax or any other
placement-related complication is noted. The accessible
pulmonary vasculature does not show any congestive pattern. The
previously described right-sided basal density terminating
rather straight and probably related to the slightly downwards
placed minor fissure, is unchanged and consistent with right
middle lobe and probably also right lower lobe atelectasis. As
on previous examinations, there is some suggestion of mild
right-sided mediastinal shift in support of this diagnosis.
There is a plate thin atelectasis on the left base but no
evidence of pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Persistent findings compatible with right lower lobe
and middle lobe atelectasis. Cause unknown. Chest followup
examination after airway exploration is recommended.
Alternatively, a CT chest examination may clarify the cause of
the abnormality.
Telephone call delivered to referring physician.
