Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72 y.o. woman with history of afib, bronchiectasis, past breast
ca who presents with fatigue and fevers x5 days. She was
otherwise well until thursday of last week when she developed
significant fatigue, anorexia and vaginal pain. She attributed
these symptoms to the heat and a vaginal infection, for which
she tried Monostat cream. This resolved her vaginal symptoms,
but Saturday morning she was awakened from sleep by severe pain
([**11-18**]) in her RLQ. She also noted night sweats, chills, rigors
and subjective fever Friday night. However, she was afebrile at
97.5 that morning. On Saturday evening, she began to have high
fevers to 102-103 and chills for which she took tylenol. She
denied any back pain at that time, but did notice foul smelling
urine with some suprapubic discomfort.
.
Patient denies any recent travel or sick contacts, though she
does volunteer at [**Hospital1 18**] oncology once/week. She denies dysuria,
HA, CP, SOB, cough, nausea/vomitting. Patient did have one
episode of loose stool on Friday, but no bowel movement over the
weekend due to anorexia.
.
ROS: As noted above. Also negative for rash.

Studies:
[**2135-8-30**] CT Abd & pelvis w/ and w/o contrast IMPRESSION:
1. Right kidney pyelonephritis, currently uncomplicated.
2. Multiple low-density lesions in the left kidney, the largest
measuring 6 x 5 cm, most likely renal cysts.
3. Vascular atherosclerotic calcifications.
4. Small liver cysts, too small to characterize.
.
[**2135-8-31**] AP CXR IMPRESSION:
1. Signs of old TB.
2. New pneumonia in the right middle and lower lung.
3. Interstitial pulmonary edema.
.
[**2135-9-1**] TT ECHO Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal
free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved
biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
These findings are most consistent with chronic pulmonary
disease (parenchymal, vascular, etc.)
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2132-2-29**], left ventricular function appears
normal, however there is now pulmonary hypertension and RV is
slightly dilated.
.
[**2135-9-2**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-1**], there is
little interval change. Again, there is extensive pleural
calcification with opacification in the right apex and
retraction of the trachea to this side, consistent with old
tuberculosis and consequent volume loss in the right upper lobe.
Continued interstitial and alveolar edema. The opacifications in
the right mid and lower lung zones may be slightly improved.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old female with afib, bronchiectasis, past breast cancer
s/p surgery/radiation presenting with high fevers, chills, RLQ
pain and CVA tenderness consistent with pyelonephritis.
.
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient's presentation with high fevers,
chills, RLQ abd pain right-sided CVA tenderness, foul smelling
urine, and lekocytosis and her CT scan were all consistent with
pyelonephritis.  Blood cultures x2 were sent and were negative.
Her urine culture grew Klebsiella Pneumonia sensitive to
ciprofloxacin. She was treated with ceftriaxone empirically in
the ED, but was switched to PO levofloxacin on admission to the
floor due to diarrhea (see below).
.
2. Dyspnea: On the morning of [**9-1**], the patient developed
significant shortness of breath, requiring 6L O2 to maintain a
saturation above 90 (from baseline 92% RA). A CXR was obtained
and showed bilteral patchy infiltrates, consistent with PNA or
pulmonary edema.  An echo showed normal LVEF, new pulmonary
hypertension, and slight RV dilation. There was no mention of
diastolic dysfunction. There was normal ventricular
contractility. The patient was transferred to the ICU, and
Cefipime 2g IV q24h was added for possible psuedomonal
infection. Levofloxacin was changed to 750mg IV q48h. The
patient was also given 20mg IV lasix, with significant
improvement in subjective symptoms. She was returned to CC7
during the afternoon on [**9-2**], though still required 6L to
maintain an O2 saturation of 94%, but with improved subjective
dyspnea.  Her WBC count began to trend downward on [**9-3**]
(17.4->15.8), the patient became afebrile, and was weaned from
O2. She received a second dose of 20mg Lasix on the evening of
[**9-2**], and was -1L that day. The patient was initially fluid
restricted in the ICU and on admission to the floor, but fluid
restriction was removed on [**9-3**] AM given clinical improvement.
Cepefime was discontinued on [**9-3**] due to low probability of
pseudomonal infection.  On the day of discharge, the patient no
longer required supplemental oxygen to maintain her sats above
90% and she was discharged on levofloxacin through [**2135-9-12**] to
finish a 14 day course of antibiotics.
.
3. Diarrhea: After receiving IV ceftriaxone in the ED for
treatment of pyelonephritis, the patient experienced significant
diarrhea with 12-14 bowel movements during the night, for which
she was unable to reach the comode. Stool culture was negative
for C. Diff, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella. Symptoms
resolved once ceftriaxone was discontinued. The patient remained
without diarrhea for remainder of the hospital stay.
.
4. Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive at 94/60
on admission without blood pressur
