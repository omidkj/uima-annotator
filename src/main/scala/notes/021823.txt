Imaging:
CXR:
1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.

2. Small right pleural effusion with loculated fluid in the
right minor
fissure.

3. Linear opacities in both lung bases, likely atelectasis.
Infection is not completely excluded in these regions.
.
Echo: [**2134-10-16**].
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 65014**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a few week history of
dyspnea found to be secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response and congestive heart failure.
.
Congestive Heart Failure.  Patient was admitted to the MICU for
shortness of breath secondary to atrial fibrillation with a
rapid ventricular response.  She briefly required CPAP in the
ED, but was quickly weaned to room air.  She was rate controlled
with metoprolol.  She was diuresed with lasix and started on
lasix 20 mg PO daily.  She was started on Lisinopril as wel.
Her echo showed an EF of 30%.
.
Atrial fibrillation.  Patient reportedly had a history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation though her PCP was unable to
confirm this.  Her heart rate was in the 150s upon presentation
though her blood pressure remained normal.  She was rate
controlled with metoprolol but remained in atrial fibrillation.
She did nto want cardioversion as her and her family felt this
was inconsistent with her goals of care.  Given her CHADS2 score
of 2 and her high falls risk, she was started on aspirin 325 for
stroke prevention.
