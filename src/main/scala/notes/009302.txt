Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for Cardiac Cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary artery catheter
Cardiac Catheterization with 5 stents to RCA and 2 stents to LCx
complicated by LCx disection


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 74yo F with a PMH significant for basal cell carcinoma
4yrs prior s/p resection and XRT, left breast lumpectomy 20yrs
prior and no other documented medical history presented to
[**Hospital **] Hospital with SOB. The patient reports that she has had
progressive chronic cough, SOB, mucus over the last 6 months.
She states that she has been getting SOB walking up her driveway
and going up 10 stairs. The patient reports that on [**12-2**] she was
driving back from work and developed worsening cough and acutely
short of breath. She called 911 and taken to the hospital. The
patient did not have any chest pain. Of note she frequently has
high salt meals and the day of the episode of dyspnea, the
patient had a sauerkraut/hot dog meal.
.
At [**Location (un) **] she was found to have pulomary edema and diuresed 1L.
She was ruled out for MI with CE. She did however have elevated
BNP. She also underwent a CTA chest to r/o PE and revealed a
bilateral pulmonary masses and lymphadenopathy as well as a
spiculated soft tissue mass in the right subpectoral fat. She
reportly had an ECHO at OSH with EF 35-40% and
inferoposterolateral hypokinesis. The patient also had new
inverted T-waves on ECG. Given her multiple risk factors for CAD
and ischemic ekg changes, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.
.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient stated that her breathing had
improved since admission, but was not back to her baseline. She
is not on O2 at home. She denied any chest pain, leg swelling or
edema. She also denied weight loss or weight gain.
.
Once admitted to the Cardiology service, she was continued on
metoprolol, aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin. She underwent
cardiac catheterization [**2104-12-5**] during which anatomy showed LCX
70-80% mid circ, OM2, and RCA 70% proximal, TO distal, 70% PL.
She received 5 bare metal stents to her RCA and 2 bare metal
stents to her LCx. During deployment of the stent her LCx was
dissected with myocardial stain. This was treated with an
overlapping stent with restoration of flow. She experienced [**6-29**]
chest pain/tightness during the perforation with associated
diaphoresis. She did not experience nausea or left arm, left jaw
radiation. She underwent a stat echo which did not reveal
echocardiographic evidence of perforation or tamponade.
.
Her primary oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and will follow-up the lung
masses as an outpatient.

with 3 children. She works as a bank clerk at Fidelity.

Sinus rhythm with baseline artifact. Inferior myocardial
infarction. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Cath [**12-5**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right domiant system
demonstrated two (2) vessel coronary artery disease.  The right
coronary
artery was diffusely diseased including a total occlusion in the
distal
portion of the vessel along with a 70% lesion in the proximal
portion of
the vessel.  The left main demonstrated no angiographically
apparent
disease.  The left anterior descending artery demonstrated a 70%
lesion
in the proximal portion of the first diagonal.  The left
circumflex
demonstrated an 80% lesion in the mid portion of the vessel
extending
into the second obtuse marginal.
2.  LV ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right (RVEDP =
19mm Hg)
and left (mean PCWP = 26 mm Hg) filling pressures.  The cardiac
index
was preserved.
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal right coronary
artery
with three bare metal stents (See PTCA comments).
5.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal right coronary
artery
with two overlapping bare metal stents (See PTCA comments).
6.  Successful stenting of the mid LCX extending into the second
obtuse
marginal with two overlapping bare metal stents.  Procedure
complicated
by an edge dissection with myocardial blushing.  Echocardiogram
demonstrated no angiographically apparent effusion.  Pt
transferred to
the unit for observation hemodynamically stable.
7.   Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with an 8F
Angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Preserved cardiac index via Fick
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension
4. Successful stenting of the distal RCA with three bare metal
stents
5. Successful stenting of the proximal RCA with two overlapping
bare
metal stents
6.  Successful stenting of the mid LCX/OM2 with two overlapping
bare
metal stents complicated by an edge dissection with myocardial
staining.
Echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of tamponade or
effusion.
7.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with an 8F
angioseal closure device.

motion are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

TTE [**12-5**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely
depres
