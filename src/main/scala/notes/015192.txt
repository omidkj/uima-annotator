HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**7-18**].  He

(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33301**].  He received medical clearance.

On [**2183-7-18**] he underwent a bipolar hemiarthroplasty
without incident.  His postoperative course was remarkable
for the development of respiratory distress noted on
postoperative day two.  The patient developed a respiratory
rate of 40 with room air saturations in the 80s with an
increase in pressure, with a temperature of 100.2.  The
patient was placed on a 100% nonrebreather with saturations
of 97%.  A chest x-ray at that time demonstrated evidence of
a right lower lobe pneumonia.  The patient was then placed on
levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and followed by that team.

On [**2183-7-21**], the patient improved and was weaned off the
nonrebreather to cool nebulizers.  He was febrile to 101.6;
and once again was monitored by the Medical Intensive Care
Unit team.  He improved; however, he did have a hematocrit
drop to 23.  The patient was on Lovenox postoperatively.
Because of this, he was transfused 2 units.  He was
guaiac-negative.  The Lovenox was then discontinued.

The patient did have lower extremity noninvasive tests
performed on [**2183-7-22**].  These were negative, and because
of this negative examination, the patient had his Lovenox and
Coumadin stopped and was placed on an aspirin per day.

discharged back to his group home on [**2183-7-25**] with
appropriate treatment.  He was partial weightbearing on his
right lower extremity at the time of discharge.  He was
afebrile with stable vital signs and a normal white count.
