IMAGING:
ECHO -
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 year old woman with respiratory failure, tracheomalacia,
CHF, presenting from rehab with concern of blood continually
suctioned from trach, fever, also with hypotension.
.
# Respiratory - Concern for mechanical problem with tub or
airway obstructing lesion; bronchoscopy done showing no
obstruction and friable, bleeding epithelia.  Treated for
presumptive PNA (initially c Zosyn and then Meropenem on ID
service recs to account for development of possible PNA).  [**3-30**]
is the last day of Meropenem; she does not need to continue this
on return to rehab.  Also briefly treated with tobramycin nebs
and fluconazole but stopped after BAL culture grew out
pansensitive Pseudomonas.  Had repeat bronchoscopy prior to
discharge and noted to have RML endobronchial lesion.  Thought
granulation tissue but pathology sent and this needs to be
followed up in the next several days for possible recurrence of
malignancy.
.
# Bacteremia. + for amp sensitive enterococcus; case discussed
with surgery and ID re: removal of port.  Decision made to treat
through infection with 2 week course of ampicillin.   Needs to
finish 8 more days of ampicillin ([**2133-4-8**]) and then have
surveillance cultures drawn 1 week after finishes ampicillin.
(TTE)ECHO done and negative for endocarditis.  Suspect PORT as
source of infection and ampicllin should be given via PORT.  No
need for removal unless she has recurrent + blood cultures.
.
# Hypotension: Patient has history of intermittent hypotension
of unclear etiology. Treated briefly with norepinephrine drip
and then found that blood pressure when measured on leg is WNL.
Levophed weaned off and midodrine dose decreased with
maintenance of normal blood pressures.  Should have BP measured
on leg.
.
# UTI: Found to have resistant Proteus in urine.   Treated with
a course of meropenem for this and finished course [**3-30**].  Urine
also grew yeast and Foley catheter replaced.
