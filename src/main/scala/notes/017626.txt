Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-2-24**] - Central line placement in right IJ
[**2147-2-24**] - Mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
34yo M PMHx DM1, ESRD (on HD [**Month/Day/Year **]/Thurs/Sat), severe
gastroparesis with recurrent admissions for nausea/vomitting
(most recent discharge [**2147-2-17**]), nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF=30-35%), presenting with nausea, vomiting, and shortness of
breath. History was initially obtained from the patient in the
emergency department, and subsequently obtained from the
patient's girlfriend by the ICU team.
.
Per ED, the patient reported that 3 days prior to day of
admission, he developed nausea and NBNB emesis, consistent with
prior episodes of gastroparesis. Symptoms were not initially
associated with any fevers/NS/chills, shortnesss of breath,
chest pain; beginning 1d prior to admission, he developed
worsening pleuritic chest pain, non-exertional, along with
shortness of breath and cough. Also reported poorly controlled
finger sticks.
.
Per the patient's girlfriend, the patient has chronic issues
with nausea/vomiting from gastroparesis. He was in his usual
state of health until Tuesday, when he awoke with shortness of
breath prior to dialysis. He felt okay after HD on Tuesday, then
developed shortness of breath on Wednesday evening/Thursday
morning. He felt better after HD yesterday, but awoke at 5 a.m.
today with nausea, vomiting, shortnss of breath. His emesis was
profuse and red, but the patient's girlfriend attributes this to
red coolaid that he drank last night. No diarrhea. Last BM
yesterday per girlfriend. Had mild coughing this morning. No
recent travel or sick contacts. Had dental work and was on
antibiotics 2-3 weeks ago. The patient's girlfriend is not sure
the patient took his usual medications this a.m. but believes he
probably did not. No recent med changes per girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **]
fever/chills. No syncope. +abdominal pain, diffuse, this a.m. No
dysuria. No rash. No myalgia/arthralgia.
.
On presentation to ED initial vital signs were 99.0 113 225/111
28 89% 3LNC. On exam patient was short of breath, appearing
fatigued. He became hypoxic, requiring a non-rebreather. On
further history taking, he reported that in setting of vomiting
he may have aspirated small amount of vomitus. Labs were
significant for WBC 11.8 (N87), Hct 29 (baseline 28), Na 131, K
4.2, glucose 678, Anion Gap 21, VBG 7.47/38, lactate 2.0. CXR
significant for pulmonary edema (radiology read), felt to be
consistent with pneumonia by ED. Patient was albuterol,
ipratropium, NTG, labetalol 10 mg IV x 2, morphine, Zofran,
vancomycin 1 gm, cefepime 2 gm. He was given succinylcholine,
propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam prior to intubation. A central
line and OGT were placed. After intubation, the patient reported
to have red frothy secretions from ET tube. Vital signs prior to
transfer were T 98.5 P 88, BP 160/91 Sat 100% on AC 500mL 22RR
10peep 100%.

Imaging:

CXR [**2-24**]:
Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema.

CXR [**2-24**]:
Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the mid
superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Other
indwelling devices
remain in standard position. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
has slightly decreased in size, and widespread pulmonary edema
has also slightly improved in the interval. Small pleural
effusions have apparently slightly decreased in size but
positional differences limit comparison.

CXR [**2-27**]:
1. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip
in the mid SVC. There is worsening bilateral airspace process
most likely representing moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. The
heart is enlarged, which could reflect cardiomegaly, although
pericardial effusion should also be considered. This is likely a
layering left effusion. No pneumothorax is seen.

CXR [**2-28**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a marked
improvement with decrease in extent of the pre-existing massive
pulmonary edema. The radiograph currently shows only mild signs
of fluid overload.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without
pleural effusions. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged
right internal jugular vein catheter.

ECHO [**2-28**]:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity
enlargement and normal regional/global systolic function.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-2-10**], the
left ventricular cavity is now smaller and systolic function is
improved. The estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
34 yo M PMHx DM1, ESRD (on HD [**Year (4 digits) **]/Thurs/Sat), severe
gastroparesis with recurrent admissions for nausea/vomitting
(most recent discharge [**2147-2-17**]), nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF previously 30-35%), presenting with nausea, vomiting,
admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.

# Respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary edema in the
setting of CHF exacerbation. Intubated in the ED due to
worsening mental status.  Extubated on [**1-25**], and able to
saturate well on room air.  On the floor he was initially on
room air.  However, on [**2-27**], patient became tachypneic and
desatted into the 70-80s in the setting of severe HTN to
220/120s.  Exam and
