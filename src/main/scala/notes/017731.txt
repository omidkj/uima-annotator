shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
70 yo F h/o previously healthy presented to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19700**]
hospital with SOB and weekness for a couple weeks. The pt was
recently able to walk a flight of stairs and go to the gym
without any SOB. Over the last couple weeks, the pt has declined
to the point where she can hardly walk out of the bedroom
without become dyspneic. The pt denies CP, although she
occasionally has noted palpitations. She has noted weight loss
of 14 lbs. The pt has also been evaluated recently for early
satiety and decreased apetite. She has nausea with eating, no
vomiting, no sensation of food getting stuck. No choking on
food.
   On the day PTA, the pt went to PCP to discuss the results of
a swallow study to evaluate the dysphagia. The PCP was concerned
about the SOB, sent the pt to ED where she was found to be in
wide-complex tachycardia thought to be rapid A-fib with aberrant
conduction, rate 116-150's. BP 111/74. She was given dilt 20mg x
2, Lasix 40 IV, and started on Dilt gtt. She subsequently
developed hypotension and recieved IVF boluses and tranferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Amio bolus and gtt started en route.
.
In ED wide-complex tachycardia was noted at 120's-150's. BP
109/59. Heparin anti-coagulation was started. Metoprolol x 1 was
given for rate control. BP dropped to 80's systolic, the pt was
started on levophed. There was concern that there were periods
of V-tach. Levophed was d/c'ed.
The pt was tranferred to the CCU with the plan for amio and dig
for rate control.

BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM [**2139-7-17**]: Barium passes freely through the
esophagus. There are normal primary peristaltic contractions.
There is no aspiration, and no retention in the valleculae or
piriform sinuses. No structural abnormalities are detected in
the region of the pharynx or cervical esophagus. When the
patient was prone, she became short of breath, and therefore
full evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux and hiatal hernia
was not completed. The stomach empties promptly, and no gross
abnormality is detected within the stomach.
.
IMPRESSION: Findings to explain the patient's symptom of
dysphagia. Normal barium esophagram.
.
R groin ultrasound [**2139-7-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Hematoma in the medial right thigh.
2. No evidence of arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
.
Head CT [**2139-7-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. No enhancing brain lesions.
.
Chest CT [**2139-7-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism detected.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral
lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Small amount of pericardial fluid, which is within the
physiologic range.
4. No para-esophageal mass detected. However, direct copmarison
with the outside study is recommended for full assessment. See
comment above.
5. Scattered ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes and
lingula, of uncertain clinical significance.
.
Echocardiogram [**2139-7-15**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe, dilated (non-ischemic) cardiomyopathy.
Moderate valvular regurgitation.
.
[**2139-7-15**] abdominal ultrasound:
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The
gallbladder is normal.
2. Echogenic areas within the liver adjacent to the gallbladder
consistent with focal fat infiltration.
3. Right-sided pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
70 yo F h/o previously healthy presented to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19700**]
hospital with SOB and weekness for a couple weeks, found to be
in rapid A-fib with aberrant conduction. Her BP has been low but
stable off pressors.
.
1. Rapid A-fib/hypotension.
In the CCU, the pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm while
on the amiodarone and digoxin therapy. The hypotension from the
prior evening was assessed to have resulted mainly from the dilt
and metoprolol doses that the pt recieved in the setting of
severely depressed systolic function. The rapid rate was also
contributing. The amiodarone was stopped on the morning of HD #1
because of liver enzyme elevation. The plan was to continue dig
for rate control and start metoprolol. A repeat echocardiogram
to assess cardiac function was obtained.
Rate control with dofetilide was considered, since amiodarone
was contraindicated with the elevated liver enzymes. However,
the QT interval was found to be prolonged on the ECG taken prior
to the dose of dofetilide was given. The plan for dofetilide was
changed. Anticoagulation with IV heparin was started on HD#1.
Coumadin was started for anti-coagulation on HD #4 once the
transaminases were trending down for a couple of days. The pt
was discharged with a plan for outpatient follow up.
.
2. Congestive Heart failure:
The pt was found to have an EF 15-20% on echocardiogram at
[**Hospital1 18**]. This represented a new diagnosis of heart failure. The
dysfunction was global, indicating a liekly non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy likely from EtOH, viral/idiopathic, or possibly
with some reversible component of tachycardia induced
cardiomyopathy. CXR here showed pulmonary edema. She had SOB,
and an oxygen requirement, satting 88-90% on RA.
-she received lasix diuresis to relieve the volume overload.
-metoprolol, ACE-inhibitor, ASA were started. statin was held
off in setting of elevated transaminases.
.
2. Dysphagia/early satiety/wt loss/guiaic positive stool:
The pt stated that she had already initiated a plan for the
work-up of these findings with another physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] CT at
[**Hospital1 18**] showed no evidence of para-esophageal mass by chest CT.
Upper GI/SBFT study was obtained with the plan for further
work-up to continue as an outpatient with the patient's primary
physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] exam revealed a Normal barium esophagram.
.
3. Severe transaminase elevation.
On the morning of HD #1, the pt's liver transaminases were found
to be elevated to 1500 range. ALk phos is normal. The
differential diagnosis was shock liver vs hepatitis vs
idiosyncratic reaction to amiodarone v
