Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization w/ DES placed in LMCA

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2412**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of HTN and no
known coronary disease who presents with chest pain. At 3 AM
this morning, she awoke from sleep with severe, stabbing
substernal chest pain radiating down the left arm. It was unlike
any pain she ever had before. There was no accompanying SOB,
diaphoresis, nausea. She activated EMS.
.
When EMS arrived, the EKG was interpreted as STEMI, and she was
given 162 mg ASA. However there was no STE on arrival to
[**Location (un) **]. Her chest pain resolved with 1 sublingual
nitroglycerin. Initial troponin was negative, second troponin
elevated at 2.41. She was treated with lopressor 12.5mg, 40 mg
IV lasix, 300mg plavix, and IV heparin 400 unit bolus and
700unit gtt (6:25am). She also received ASA 325 mg and 1.5
inches nitropaste. Repeat EKG showed NSR with AV block and LBBB.
Exam was notable for mild crackles and 2+ bilateral pedal edema.
She remained chest pain free and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for cath.
Vitals prior to transfer were 97.7, 74 SR, 18, 151/81, 99% 2l
NC.
.
In the cath lab, she was found to have a tight left main lesion
as well as severe OM and RCA disease. She remained chest pain
free. CT surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] and is contemplating CABG.
Interventional cardiology is also considering delayed
percutaneous intervention. She was transferred to the CCU for
observation and medical management while further course was
being determined. No balloon pump was placed because of severe
PVD.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient remains chest pain free. She
also denies shortness of breath or nausea. She denies orthopnea
or palpitations. She states that her lower extremity edema is
unchanged recently. She has no other complaints. At baseline,
she states that she is ambulatory with a walker and has
essentially unlimited exercise tolerance without chest pain or
shortness of breath. Review of systems otherwise negative.


Past Medical History:
-HTN
-GERD
-CHF: listed in PMHx, but patient denies having ever had
pulmonary edema, orthopnea, or need for diuretics and says that
she has never had a TTE
-TIA
-hard of hearing
-s/p polio at age 4 with mild residual of her right arm


Social History:
She lives alone, cooks for herself, and uses a walker around the
home. She is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks a glass of
wine with dinner. She was never married, and her nieces ([**Known firstname **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 89435**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 717**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) are her closest relatives.

sisters, 1 with alzhimers, 1 deceased from accident, 1 deceased
from cancer, 1 with neuropathy.

Cardiac Cath ([**2166-5-22**])
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with severe L main
disease with
elevated PCWP: see comments
2. ASA indefinitely for severe CAD
3. Admit to CCU for aggressive medical therapy pending
discussion
4. R 5Fr femoral artery and vein sheaths sutured into position
for
removal post procedure

TTE ([**2166-5-22**])
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis to
akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion

CT Torso with contrast ([**2166-5-23**])
1. Mild calcification of the ascending aorta, descending aorta
with areas of almost circumferential calcification and areas
with greater than 180 degrees of calcification. Infrarenal aorta
with moderate to severe calcification. Mild calcification of the
iliac arteries. No arterial occlusion. Soft plaque noted in the
proximal abdominal aorta.
2. Coronary arteries are heavily calcified.
3. Right groin superficial stranding with possible small
hematoma, likely
secondary to recent catheterization. Clinical correlation
recommended.
Enlarged node in this region could be followed clinically; if
not palpable, follow up ultrasound could be performed in 3
months.
4. Possible 8-mm hypodensity in the tail of the pancreas which
may be
secondary to artifact. For patients over age 70, standard
recommendation is MRCP in 1 year.
5. T12 compression fracture, age indeterminate. Correlation for
pain at this level is recommended.
6. Soft tissue asymmetry along the left vaginal wall. Direct
visualization
recommended.
