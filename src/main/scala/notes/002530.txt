Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial
fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN,
who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with lethargy and AMS. Recent history
is remarkable for being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2142-6-4**] after
presenting with abdominal pain, being found to have SBO and
undergoing lysis of adhesions and left inguinal hernia repair,
with a course complicated by pneumonia for which she received
vanc/zosyn and eventually required trach/PEG for difficulty
weaning off ventilator (was unsuccessfully extubated during
hospital stay).
.
She was doing well at [**Hospital1 **] until the morning of admission
when she was noted to be more lethargic and to have AMS. At
baseline, she is alert and oriented x 3 but was less responsive.
She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: [**Age over 90 **]F->100.4 103 95/60->75/55 100% on
trach mask. She had a RUQ U/S which was negative and a CXR which
showed a RLL pneumonia, and she was given levo/flagly for
possible c. diff, and vancomycin/ceftriaxone for
healthcare-associated pna. Her mental status was waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] but she was not felt to need an LP. Her SBP rose to 95
after infusion of 3L NS. Given her transient hypotension and
concern for sepsis, she was admitted to the MICU for further
management.
.
On the floor, she was able to answer simple questions. Her
passy-muir valve had been removed but per report, even while it
was in place in the ED, she was nonverbal. She denied chest
pain, headache, shortness of breath, and pain in general.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2142-6-14**] 11:47 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe multi-chamber cardiomegaly. Pulmonary hypertension.
2. Suspected tracheobronchomalacia.
3. Bibasilar extensive consolidations accompanied by volume loss
that might be considered for a combination of atelectasis and
pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Upper lung opacities that might represent infection versus
pulmonary dema. Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded but
should be correlated with clinical findings.
5. Extreme kyphosis due to the presence of multiple thoracic
fractures is described in detail within the text.

ECHO [**2142-6-14**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with normal free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral valve disks appears
slightly thickened, but open normally. The mean gradient (9
mmHg) is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Given estimated RA pressures, pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension is estimated as severe. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle. Normal global and regional
left ventricular systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation.
