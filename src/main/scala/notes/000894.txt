History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old female who was D/Ced from [**Hospital1 **] two days
prior to presentation after a prolonged hospitalization for
dysphagia which resulted in a diagnosis of paraneoplastic
syndrome with an unknown primary (although lung suspected).
Ultimately a PEG tube was placed and the patient was discharged
home with VNA for further work-up as an outpatient. At home she
was gradually more short of breath. On the day of admit she
became acutely short of breath. EMS noted her sat to be 84 on
room air at home. There was a clinical concern for aspiration.
Her husband reported that it sounded like something was caught
in her throat.
.
In her last hospitalization she underwent an EGD (biopsy with
blunted villi and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes),
colonoscopy, transvaginal ultrasound, Mammogram, PEG placement,
and a bronchoscopy. No tumor was found. A neuro work up revealed
Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody was positive with a titer 1:640. She was
treated with IVIG for 5 days.
.
In the ED initial vitals were 98.6 110 101/80 24 89. Patient was
given ceftriaxone 1g, flagyl 500mg and azithromycin 500mg. 500cc
fluids. Her hct was noted to be 26.9, down from 31 a few days
prior (39-40 in early [**Month (only) **]). Her WBC count was 5.8 with 18%
bands. Her Na was 124 (recently diagnosed with a paraneoplastic
syndrome and has had hyponatremia for the last week). Cl was 87
and Cr 0.7.  Her vitals on transfer to the MICU were 99, 96/54,
108, 25, 94% NRB.
.
In the MICU, she was tachycardic and subjectivly short of
breath. She did not endorse any chest pain, HA, N/V/C/D. No
peripheral edema, no rashes, no sick contacts, no myalgias.

Imaging
Chest XR ([**2125-6-8**] 3:31 PM)
IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities. While findings could
represent prominent bibasilar atelectasis, aspiration or
infectious process is of concern.
.
Chest XR ([**2125-6-17**] 9:18 PM)
IMPRESSION:
The tracheostomy tip is relatively at the midline, 3.5 cm above
the carina.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bibasilar
opacities are consistent with areas of atelectasis. Upper lungs
are essentially clear. No appreciable worsening since the prior
study has been demonstrated.

The right central venous line tip is at the level of low SVC.

Percutaneous gastrostomy is projecting over the left upper
quadrant.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely [**1-9**] aspiration of
secretions from dysphagia/paraneoplastic disorder.  During her
time in the ICU, she was treated for 8 days for hospital
acquired PNA with vancomycin and cefepime and ultimately
narrowed to CTX for proteus that grew out of her sputum.  A
trial extubation occurred after treatment with antibiotics and
scopolamine to try to decrease secretions, but she became
acutely dyspenic almost immediately after extubation and
required re-intubation.  She was trach'ed on [**2125-6-15**] by IP
without difficulty.  It was felt that her upper airway collapse,
secondary to her paraneoplastic syndromes,  was the cause of her
respiratory distress.  She continued to require frequent
suctioning while on the floor and ultimately failed a Passy-Muir
valve trial due to her secretions.  On discharge, she required
less frequent suctioning, her oxygen saturation has remained 99%
and above, and was breathing comfortably with the aid of a 35%
O2 trach mask.
.
# Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody syndrome and [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] myasthenic
syndrome:  Neurology was consulted early in her hospital course,
as they have been following her previously.  Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] Ab and
voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies found to be positive.
As these syndromes usually indicat
