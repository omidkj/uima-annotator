History of Present Illness:
History was obtained from his son and [**Name (NI) **] records:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4924**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a PMH significant for
severe MR, ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular
dysfunction with an EF of 30% in [**2197-2-12**], NSVT, and a history
of ischemic bowel due to overdiuresis.  He was in his usual
state of health until a few days ago when he started feeling
very weak and fatigued.
.
His son went to pick him up tonight, and as they were walking
toward the car, he became fatigued and weak, to the point where
he wanted to go back in the house.  They turned around and as
they were walking toward the house, he progressively became
weaker to the point where his son had to carry him and lay him
on a bench.  They called EMS, and between the time that they
called EMS and their arrival (~5 minutes or longer) he became
pulseless and apneic.
.
On arrival, EMS found him to be apneic and pulsless.  They began
CPR and gave 1mg of epinephrine.  He went into ventricular
tachycardia, and he was shocked once at 200J, and given 1mg of
lidocaine and put on a lidocaine drip.  He was intubated and
bagged in the field.  CPR was performed for 15 minutes.
.
In the ED his VS were BP: 150/70, HR: 60, RR: being bagged.  He
was placed on the lidocaine drip.  His ET tube placement was
verified on chest x-ray.  A left IJ CVL was placed. He was
persistently hypotensive for 40 mins to 80's, ranging 80's to
100's so he was started on Dopamine and arctic sun protocol.
Neuro exam prior to sedation (fentanyl/versed) was positive for
gag, blink, pupils 1mm non-reactive, biting tube, not moving
extremities, not withdrawing from pain.  A-line attempt in L
wrist failed.  CXR clear. Noted to have melana.  After
discussion with the family, arctic sun protocol was stopped.
.
Per the son, he denied any recent complaints of chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, or lightheadedness.  The only significant positive
symptoms were weakness and fatigue x2 days.
.
On arrival to the floor, vitals were BP 102/53, HR 72, RR 17,
and O2 sats of 100% on AC 450/14/5/100% FiO2.  He was intubated
and sedated.

5. Nonsustained VT.
6. Prior syncopal episodes in the past due to hypovolemia.
7. Ischemic bowel disease in the setting of over diuresis.
8. Coronary artery disease status post CABG x3 in [**2181**] with a
LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the circumflex and acute marginal.

Chest X-Ray [**2198-9-20**]:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: A dual-lead pacing device is
unchanged. There
has been a prior median sternotomy and CABG. An endotracheal
tube tip lies 4 cm from the carina. An NG tube tip is in
stomach. There is a left internal jugular line, with tip
obscured by the overlying pacer leads, though likely lies within
the mid SVC. The heart is top normal in size. Mildly increased
interstitial markings suggest
