HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 23654**] is an 81 year old
male with a history of non Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post
radiation chemo treatment and hypertension.  He is deaf. He
presented with a three day history of abdominal pain. He was
found to have an incarcerated hernia and was admitted to the
surgery service for successful repair. See surgery dictation
and operating room note for further details regarding his
surgery.  After the surgery, he was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with a left bundle branch block on his
electrocardiogram. He was ruled out by cardiac enzymes.  He
denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  At home, the
patient is very functional. He does not complain of chest
pain or shortness of breath.  He denies any orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling.

Surgery service requested an echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of 25%, normal left ventricular wall
thickness and severe regional wall motion abnormalities;
akinesis of the inferior septal wall; hypokinesis of the
septal wall. 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ mitral
regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension.  MRA
moderately dilated.
He was seen in consultation by our EP service who recommended
rate control, anticoagulation and follow-up for D-C
cardioversion. The patient was admitted to the C-Med service
for cardiac catheterization.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is deaf.  He lives with his
wife.  His daughter interprets for him.  Denies smoking or
alcohol use. Interestingly, the patient was institutionalized
as a child and has wariness for medical care. No known drug
allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was
afebrile; heart rate of 102 and irregular; blood pressure
104/76; respiratory rate of 18; 99% on room air.  In general,
he is in no apparent distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND
THROAT: Extraocular movements intact.  MMI.  Sclera
anicteric.  Right orbit sunken.  Has a glass eye in the right
orbit.  Neck: Some jugular venous distention, no carotid
bruits. Chest: Mild crackles at bases.  CV: Irregularly
irregular, no murmurs appreciated.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender,
nondistended. Normoactive bowel sounds. Midline incision was
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, clean, dry and intact.  Extremities:
Trace to 1+ edema bilaterally.  1+ femoral pulses
bilaterally.  1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  No
femoral bruits.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count was 14.3;
hematocrit of 32.9; potassium of 3.2; BUN 42; creatinine 1.4;
magnesium 1.6.

Electrocardiogram showed left bundle branch morphology and
irregularly irregular rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Incarcerated hernia:  Please see
surgery operative report and dictation for further details
regarding his surgery during the course of his time on the
C-Med service. His midline incision healed.  He had a
dehiscence of the lower groin incision; however, the wound
was clean and did not have any drainage.  At the time of
discharge, both incisions were clean, dry and intact.

2.) Coronary artery disease:  The patient had an
echocardiogram on [**2198-11-14**] which showed a moderately dilated
left atrium.  Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior akinesis, septal hypokinesis,
apical hypokinesis/akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 3+
mitral regurgitation.  2+ tricuspid regurgitation.  4+ CR.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient was then taken for a cardiac catheterization on
[**2198-11-16**] where he was found to have a diffuse 30% stenosis of
the proximal right coronary artery, 30% stenosis at the mid
right coronary artery and 60% stenosis at the distal right
coronary artery.  He had discrete 30% stenosis of the left
main, discrete 50% stenosis of the mid left anterior
descending and a 90% stenosis of the diffusely diseased left
circumflex.  Final diagnoses were as follows:
One vessel coronary artery disease.
Mildly elevated LVEDP.
No aortic stenosis.
Mitral regurgitation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Successful stenting of the mid left circumflex.

The patient was started on Plavix.  He was continued on
aspirin and beta-blocker during the course of his
hospitalization.  He complained of no further chest pain.
However, during the course of subsequent events in the
hospital and stresses, it was noted that when the patient had
an increased heart rate, he had mildly elevated troponin
2.05, believed to be related to elevated heart rate.
Subsequent electrocardiograms throughout his hospitalization
showed no changes compared to previous electrocardiograms.

Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was seen in consultation by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] in the EP service.  He was rate controlled
with beta-blocker and was started on Coumadin for
anticoagulation.  One attempt at cardioversion was made;
however, he spontaneously reverted back to atrial
fibrillation.  At the time of this dictation, the patient is
continued on heparin for anticoagulation, being rate
controlled with a beta blocker.  Eventually, he will be
transitioned back to Coumadin after his hospitalization.

Congestive heart failure:  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for acute congestive heart failure
exacerbation during the course of the hospitalization.  He
was diuresed with Lasix.  He has an ejection fraction of 25%.
He was continued on a beta-blocker, Ace inhibitor and Lasix.
At the time of this dictation, he is well compensated without
signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure.

Mental status change:  After the time of the patient's DC
cardioversion, the patient was noted to have some mental
status changes.  He became agitated, was intermittently
staring off into space and was not responding appropriately
to his sign language interpreter or family. At that time, he
had a CT scan and MR which were both negative for acute
bleed. However, the MR was poor study because of his
movement. He was also seen in consultation by the neurology
service and an EEG was obtained which showed diffuse
encephalopathy but no focal seizure activity.  It was felt
that his change in mental status was secondary to delirium
which could be caused by a multiple of factors including
changes in electrolytes.  At the time of the change in mental
status, the patient was noted to be hypernatremic.  He also
had a chest x-ray which showed a right lower lobe infiltrate,
believed to be an aspiration pneumonia.  At that time, he was
placed on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl to treat the aspiration
pneumonia. He completed a 14 day course of antibiotics.
Around the time that his mental status began to change, he
also stopped swallowing.

Swallowing:  When he had mental status changes, he stopped
swallowing. He had a total of two speech and swallow
evaluations during his hospitalization, both of which showed
contrast slipping into the trachea and not prompting a
swallow reflex.  The cause of his decline in swallowing is
thought to be secondary to his mental status changes and
delirium.  Nasogastric tube was placed and tube feeds were
started during the course of his admission.  At the time of
this dictation, gastroenterology service has seen the patient
in consultation and is planning for percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy placement prior to discharge to a rehabilitation
facility.

Mental status changes:  The patient's mental status changes
could be due to a number of causes during this
hospitalization but, at
