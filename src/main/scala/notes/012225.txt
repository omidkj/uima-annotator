Brief Hospital Course:
1.  STREP VIRIDANS PROSTHETIC VALVE ENDOCARDITIS:
AT [**Hospital1 18**], became more confused, hypoxic, with pH=7.23.
Transferred to MICU where he was intubated for increasing
respiratory distress.  Became hypotensive --> pressors.  Neck CT
([**5-16**]) decmonstrated 8mm oval L cerebellar lesion.  Repeat head
CT on [**5-18**] and then on [**5-26**] demonstrated same nonenhancing
lesion unchanged from [**5-16**] involving the cerebellar peduncle
with some extension into the pons.

[**Location (un) 620**] Bl Cx positive x2 sets for Strep viridans PCN, MIC <0.1.
 The patient's antibiotic regimen included CTX and gentamycin.
Bl Cx in [**Hospital1 18**] from [**5-13**] remained negative.  TEE was performed
twice with no demonstration of any vegetations.  The patient
remained mildly febrile with a normal WBC until he was switched
from CTX to PCN G 4MU q4h after which his fever dissipated.  Pt
improved, was hemodynamically stable and was extubated after a 5
day ICU stay, then transferred to floor.  He completed a 2 week
treatment course of a beta-lactam and gentamycin.  Gentamycin
was dosed for synergy.  PCN G was add midway through the 2 wk
treatment course.

2.  DELERIUM:
On the floor remained delerious but with slow improvement.  The
etiology of his delerium was felt to be secondary to
toxic-metabolic enchephalopathy (sepsis, CNS toxic drugs), and
ICU psychosis.  CNS toxic agents were held, low dose risperidone
0.5 mg qhs was started to help reinstate an appropriate
sleep-wake cycle, and ropinirole was given to minimize periodic
leg movements (restless leg syndrome).  Evaluation of his
delerium was complicated by the patient's unwillingness to
cooperate with the neurologic and mental status exam secondary
to frustration with the hospital staff and depression.  The
patient slowly improved until he was anwering questions
appropriately and able to function without a sitter or need
restraints.

3. PROSTHETIC AORTIC VALVE, anticoagulation:
Pt was appropriately anticoagulated for AVR without any
complications.  He remained with good cardiac function without
any evidence of heart failure albeit on minimal activity.  No
significant changes in mumur characteristics or conduction were
noted.

4.  COPD, OSA on BIPAP:
It was felt that the patient's respiratory distress was
compounded by the patient's underlying chronic lung disease.
Oxygenation steadily improved until the patient was weaned off
O2 during the day.  Required O2 with BIPAP machine while
sleeping.

5.  CEREBELLAR INFARCT, septic embolus:
Mr. [**Known lastname 52461**] remained ataxic on his left side with a wide step gait
and headaches at the base of his skull/neck.  Serial CTs of the
head with contrast demonstrated normal evolution of the infarct
without evidence of a cerebellar abscess.  PT and OT
consultation and treatment was obtained and provided, however
the patient will need extensive and long rehabilition for
adequate recovery of motor function.

6.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
At the end of his hospital stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 52461**] developed acute renal
failure secondary to dehydration (based on calculated FENa =
0.8%, physical exam findings consistent with dehydration and
reversal of rising Cr with rehydration).  He was treated with
increased PO fluid intake and IVF.  His baseline Creatinine is
0.9.  He is being discharged with a Cr=1.6.  MR [**Known lastname **] WILL
CONTINUE TO REQUIRE MORE FLUIDS (INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS IF POSSIBLE,
IN ADDITION TO DRINKING AT LEAST 1 LITER OF FLUID EACH DAY).
His LISINOPRIL, LASIX, AND METFORMIN were held pending
normalization of his renal function.  THE METFORMIN CAN BE
RESTARTED AFTER THE CREATININE < 1.5
