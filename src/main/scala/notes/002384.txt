Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male who
was originally admitted to care for hypoxia, hypertension,
and mental status changes.  Reportedly, the patient had
abrupt onset of dyspnea and was found to be hypoxic.  At
outside hospital, the gas on 100% FIO2 of 85, pCO2 30, pH
7.47 with a systolic blood pressure of 70.  He denies other
symptoms at that time.  Chest x-ray revealed extensive
bilateral pulmonary disease consistent with lymphangitic
carcinomatosis and perhaps pulmonary edema.

Electrocardiogram demonstrated inferior ST elevation and ST
depression in V2 and Q waves in the inferior leads.  He did
have a history of an old inferior myocardial infarction.
Troponin-I peak at 1.92, peak CK at 210.  CT scan of the
chest was negative for pulmonary embolus.  Echocardiogram
demonstrated ejection fraction of 50% with posterior wide
hypokinesis, mild MR and mild TR.  He was then transferred to
the [**Hospital6 **], where he underwent catheterization
revealing 90% lesion in the mid right coronary artery with
thrombus.  He was referred to [**Hospital1 188**] for PCI of the right coronary artery lesion.

Catheterization here revealed 60-70% lesion in the mid circ
and distal circ in addition to the right coronary artery
lesion.  The right coronary artery lesion was stented in two
places with much difficulty.

In the holding area, he was noted to have decreased mental
status and increased confusion.  O2 sat was found to be 70%.
He was given Lasix, intravenous nitroglycerin, and placed on
100% nonrebreather at which time his oxygen saturation
improved to 90-100%.  He was then transferred to the CCU for
further evaluation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals at that time included a heart
rate of 58, blood pressure 132/61, respirations 19, and he
was 96% on nonrebreather.  He is a pleasant man in no acute
distress.  Pupils are small but reactive.  Heart:  He had a
regular, rate, and rhythm with a II/VI crescendo systolic
murmur.  His lungs have bibasilar dry, rhonchorous, coarse
throughout especially in the lower lobe.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds with no
hepatosplenomegaly.  He had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Metastatic prostate cancer with bone metastases to the
right humeral.
2. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
six years ago treated with medical therapy.  A recent ETT
showed inferior fixed defects, ejection fraction of 50%.
3. Hypertension.
4. Zoster.
5. High cholesterol.
6. Status post appendectomy.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 50.
2. Zocor.
3. Neurontin.
4. Vicodin.
5. Levaquin.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] positive
alcohol 1-2 drinks.  He quit smoking tobacco 50 years ago.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course is relatively
uncomplicated.  He was admitted to CCU.  He was gently
diuresed with Lasix and intravenous nitroglycerin.  He was
gradually weaned.  His oxygen was gradually weaned down to 2
liters nasal cannula, however, there was not much improvement
following this intervention.  It was thought that his O2
requirement could possible be due to a primary pulmonary
process that could have been lymphangitic carcinomatosis or
fibrosis, perhaps from her Taxotere therapy.

Patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells to
maintain his hematocrit above 30 with a recent coronary
event.  His laboratories on admission were 17.7, 32.4
hematocrit, platelets 189.  Sodium 144, potassium 3.8,
chloride 110, bicarb 21, BUN 42, creatinine 0.8, glucose 157,
calcium 8.7, magnesium 2.0, phosphorus 3.9.

Cardiovascular:  He had two stents placed to his RCA.  He was
continued on Plavix, aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE
inhibitor.  He was kept on Integrilin for 18 hours.
Reportedly at the outside hospital, the patient was found to
have an atypical pneumonia.  He was continued on Levaquin.
His QTC was monitored because of the prepencity of Levaquin
to lengthen QTC.

Patient was seen by Physical Therapy who said that he was
safe to be discharged home and recommended PT visit to
maximize rehabilitation.

He was discharged home in good condition after speaking with
the patient's oncologist with close followup to further
workup the primary lung process causing him to have a new
oxygen requirement.  The patient was discharged home with
home O2.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day x4 days.
2. Simvastatin 2 mg po q day.
3. Gabapentin 400 mg po bid.
4. Protonix 40 mg po q day.
5. Lasix 40 mg po q day.
6. Atenolol 50 mg q am, 25 mg q pm.
7. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
8. Home O2 by 2 liters nasal cannula continuous.
9. Plavix 75 mg po q day.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was to followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2912**] in two weeks.  In addition, he has an appointment
with his oncologist the following week.
