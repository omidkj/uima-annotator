Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Tricuspid regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tricuspid valve replacement(33mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue) [**2156-11-29**]


History of Present Illness:
This 65 year old white male has known nonischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy for years.  he has previously undergone
biventricular pacemeker/ICD placement and has had progressive
tricuspid regurgitation.  The device was recently explanted due
to concern for the lead interfering with the tricuspid valve.

He has continued to have worsening symptoms and was referred for
surgical intervention.  Catheterization previously demonstarted
no obstructive coronary disease, severely depressed LV
function(15-20%) and elevated right heart pressures.

Past Medical History:
 s/p biventricular pacer/ICD placement [**2155-8-10**]
s/p removal of pacer/ICD
s/p Left achilles tendon repair
s/p Sinus Surgery
chronic atrial fibrillation
nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy
chronic dysphagia

-Tobacco history:  Never smoker
-ETOH:  Quit when diagnosed with heart failure

ECHO [**2156-12-3**]
The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
tricuspid valve is present. The prosthetic tricuspid leaflets
appear normal. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2156-11-23**], the tricuspid valve has been replaced by a
bioprosthesis. The right ventricle is no longer dilated.
Trace-to-mild tricuspid regurgitation is present. Left
ventricular function is improved due to reduction of right
ventricular size, as well as reduction of ventricular
interaction.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted a day early for PA catheter placement and
diuresis. Despite ultrasound visualization and an hour's time,
the catheter could not be passed across the valve due to the
regurgitant jet.  Diuresis was undertaken.

On [**11-29**] he went to the Operating Room where valve replacement
was performed (see operative note for details).  He weaned from
bypass on Levophed and Milrinone.  The PA catheter was placed at
the end of the case, with great difficulty. He remained
stable,and was extubated the day of surgery.  Over the next few
days the Milrinone was weaned off and he did well.  He was
diuresed toward his pre-operative weight and Coumadin was
started for atrial fibrillation.

Carvedilol was started for his cardiomyopathy and the Torsemide
he was on at home resumed after stopping Lasix.  Wires were
removed as were CTs.  He ambulated in the ICU and progressed
well.  Physical Therapy was consulted for strength as well.

He was  cleared for discharge to home on POD# 9 with VNA
services, on medications as listed with appropriate follow up
appointments.  Coumadin will continue to be managed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] his primary cardiologist.
