Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 87-year-old woman with
complicated medical history, who was transferred to our
facility from an outside hospital because of uncontrollable
hypertension.  The patient has a long complicated history of
congestive heart failure, hypertension difficult to control
with medications, and a recent myocardial infarction.  More
recently, about a week earlier, she was admitted to an
outside hospital with congestive heart failure.  Her course
was complicated by intubation and Intensive Care Unit course
of about two days.

She apparently improved without intubation, but had
hypertension which was unresponsive to medications.  She was
therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further management.  At the same time, the patient had
recently ruled in for a small myocardial infarction and a
cardiac catheterization was another reason for the transfer.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. A-V block with left bundle branch block.
5. Sick sinus syndrome status post pacer placed in [**2096**].
6. Recurrent congestive heart failure.
7. Atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter.
8. Coronary artery disease with ST elevation.
9. Myocardial infarction in [**2105**] and then again in [**2106**].
10. Peripheral vascular disease.
11. Chronic renal failure with a baseline of 1.8.
12. Status post cholecystectomy.
13. Status post stroke in [**2103**].

ALLERGIES:  Procardia, Mevacor, as well as sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Nitropaste 1".
2. Lopressor 100 tid.
3. Univasc 15 [**Hospital1 **].
4. Norvasc 10 q day.
5. Plavix 75 q day.
6. Bumex 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
7. Pravachol 40 q day.
8. Glyburide 1.5 q day.
9. K-Dur 20 [**Hospital1 **].
10. Ecotrin 325 q day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies the use of tobacco, alcohol, or
drugs.  Lives at home by herself with VNA services.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of myocardial infarction at age
49.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature of 97.8, blood pressure
210/120, pulse 90, respiratory rate 18, and sating 95% on 1
liter.  HEENT examination is unremarkable.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is
clear.  Lungs:  Poor inspiratory effort, poor air movement.
Crackles at the bases bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Jugular
venous pressure around 8 cm, S1, S2 with no S3, S4, [**1-5**]
holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
pedal edema, 1+ DP and PT pulses.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Initial cardiac catheterization
revealed bilateral renal artery stenosis, which is believed
to the reason for her uncontrolled hypertension.  The patient
was therefore transferred to the CCU for further management.
Initially, she was started on fenoldopam drip which had
significant improvement in her high blood pressure.

On day #1, patient developed congestive heart failure.
Diuresis with Lasix did not achieve adequate results.  At the
same time, her renal function significantly worsened with her
creatinine climbing up to about 4.0.  Her oxygenation was
getting significantly worse and therefore she required
intubation.  Despite continuing efforts, there was no
improvement in her renal function and after consultation with
the Renal service, dialysis was initiated.

At the same time, the patient underwent a repeat angiography
of the renal arteries with a stent placement.  Even with
those efforts, there was no improvement in her renal
function, and her creatinine remained at around 4.0.

From a respiratory standpoint, the patient remained
intubated, and was unable to be weaned off ventilation.  On
day number four or five, she developed what appeared to be
pneumonia, which did not respond to treatment with
antibiotics.

Around hospital day number eight, the patient started growing
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] from one of the blood cultures.

After numerous discussions with the family members, it was
determined that the patient's wishes had been to not have medical
intervention continued if deemed futile. Given her significant
respiratory compromise, that is inability to wean off
ventilation as well as the presence of a pneumonia that was
not responding to treatment, combined with her renal failure
and apparent fungal sepsis, her possibility of recovery
during the Intensive Care Unit stay was estimated to be very
small.

This information is presented to the family members and in
agreement with patient previous wishes, a decision was made
to make the patient's comfort measures only.

She was extubated and passed away peacefully in the company
of family members and loved ones.
