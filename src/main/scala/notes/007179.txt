History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 52 year old female with history of Down's Syndrome,
dementia, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presents to
the emergency room after a visit with her physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) 95980**] of
her group home brought her to the physician office as they were
concerned about her safety in the group home due to lack of oral
intake, difficulty walking (per report was newly in a wheelchair
for last two week). The ED physicians spoke with her brother,
who is also her HCP, who per report told them that she had had
very poor PO intake for "a while" at the group home, and the
family had been discussing moving her to a facility with a
higher-level of care.

Per report, her caregiver stated that her mental status appeared
at baseline, which was not very communicative. A copy of her PCP
visit note accompanies her paperwork and describes that she has
lost about 35 lbs, and possibly has been vomiting. Her INR was 7
recently and she received vitamin K for that.

Based on a speech and swallow evaluation note from [**2140-10-25**] in
OMR, at that time staff in the group home were concerned about
the patient's lack of PO intake. It was described at that time
that the patient was refusing former favorite foods, and would
eat about [**2-26**] spoonfulls prior to spitting out solid foods at
meals; there was also concern about choking on pills. It was
also noted that the patient appeared to regurgitate food after
meals (ongoing behavoir for 20 years). It was noted that she had
lost about 15 pounds due to this behavoir. The evaluation by the
speech and swallow team determined that her inadequate PO intake
was possibly secondary to dementia and behavoiral changes,
although further studies were recommended given inability to
fully evaluate.

Also of note, patient was admitted in [**Month (only) **] for failure to
thrive and decreased PO intake. It was found that she was
constipated, and she was tolerating a regular diet prior to
discharge.

In the ED, initially it was difficult to measure the patient's
blood pressure. Her heart rate was 90, respiratory rate of 14,
with difficulty measuring oxygen saturation. First recorded
blood pressure was 92/palp, with oxygen saturation of 100%.
Patient was lethargic but responsive with moaning and crying out
to verbal stimuli. She was given 2L of NS initially when her SBP
dropped to 70's and 80's. She was guaiac negative, and a chest
x-ray was unremarkable. Labs were notable for renal
insufficiency, hypernatremia (166), hyperchloremia (124),
lactate of 9.2, INR of 9.6 (then >11), and leukocytosis of 14.
A femoral line was placed and patient was given 4L of IVF with
improvement to systolics in 100's. However, then patient fell
asleep and systolic dropped to 70's, so she received an
additional 2 liters and levophed was started. She was given
vancomycin and zosyn, and cultures were drawn. She was also
given 5 mg of IV vitamin K for elevated INR. EKG was without
concering changes. FAST was negative (no free fluid, bedside
echo looked ok).

Upon arrival to the floor, patient was crying out. She would
make eye contact occasionally and stated "I love you" once,
otherwise was incomprehensible.
