Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Ulceration of right hallux with bone exposure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Amputation of rigth hallux


History of Present Illness:
:  68 yo male is direct admit who is to undergo surgery on
Friday. Pt has been seen in [**Hospital **] clinic for ulcer on right
foot . Pt states that the ulcers have been present for extended
periods of time. He had undergone surgery in [**Month (only) 205**] for his 5th
digit. He then developed callus which lead to an ulcer on his
right big toe. Pt admits to numerous office debridements and
wound care techniques. Pt admits to using wet to dry dsg,
offloading, felted foam dressing and currently regranex.  At
last visit, he underwent a percutaneous flexor tenotomy  on
hallux to try and relieve tension causing the increased pressure
on the toe.  Pt admits to noticing redness and drainage form the
area. He is currently on Augmentin  for both ulcerations on
right foot.  Pt also has felted foam dressing placed at his last
visit. He denies N/V/F/Sob/chills. Pt states that he spoke with
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding having a part of the toe amputated.

Pertinent Results:
[**2125-2-15**] RIGHT FOOT, THREE VIEWS:
Since [**2124-7-14**], there has been increased osteolysis and
irregularity of the margins of the prior fifth metatarsal
amputation site, seen on ly on the AP view. The finding lies
deep to the soft tissue ulcer of the lateral foot. The
appearance of the resected first distal phalanx and second
distal metatarsal are unchanged. The remaining osseous
structures are demineralized, suggesting disuse.
IMPRESSION:
Interval development of irregular margins of the fifth
metatarsal osteotomy site. While this could represent an
atypical of healing, given its proximity to the skin ulcer,
osteomyelitis should also be considered.
.
P-mibi [**2125-2-16**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal myocardial perfusion. Severe perfusion
defect of the inferior wall which is mildly reversible at the
apex. Moderate, reversible defect of the inferolateral wall. 2.
Global hypokinesis and akinesis of the inferior wall with a
calculated ejection fraction of 39%.
.
[**2125-2-16**] ART EXT:
FINDINGS: Doppler evaluation shows monophasic waveforms
diffusely and bilaterally, those at the PT level are absent
bilaterally. ABI measurements could not be obtained on the right
due to absent pulses and overlying bandage, on the left, the ABI
is 0.45. The volume recordings demonstrate diffuse waveform
widening and extremely low amplitude at the metatarsal levels
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: Findings as stated above which indicate significant
aortoiliac disease. There is likely SFA/popliteal disease and
definite tibial disease bilaterally.
.
[**2125-2-16**] CT chest without contrast:
1. No evidence of tumor recurrence, status post left upper
lobectomy.
2. Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
3. Nonspecific interstitial changes of the lung bases likely
represent scarring or fibrosis. These appear unchanged from the
prior examination.
.
Cardiac cath [**2125-2-19**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system. LMCA
had a 50% tapering distal lesion that was calcified and
unchanged from
prior angiogram in [**2123**]. LAD was calcified with a mid-segment
60%
lesion. LCX was non-dominant with 50% OM1 lesion. RCA was a
dominant
vessel that was proximally occluded with robust L->R
collaterals.
2. Pressure wire measurement across the LMCA showed an FFR of
0.83 at
maximal hyperemia which was consistent with a hemodynamically
non-significant lesion.
3. Left ventriculography showed preserved ejection fraction.
4. Limited hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated
systemic
pressures and no aortic valve gradient.
5. Abdominal aortography showed patent aorto-bifemoral bypass
without
iunflow lesions.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease (mild to moderate).
2. Normal ventricular function.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68 yo with DM, CAD s/p stents, HTN, Hyperlipidemia here
with elective amputation for osteo of foot but was found to be
hypoxic and p-mibi now showing moderate.
.
#. Hypoxia: The patient was satting 91% on RA at admission.
After receiving IV lasix, hypoxia resolved.  Repeat CXR was
consistent with emphysema, and MDI was started.  Repeat CT of
chest without contrast did not show any evidence of recurrent
lung cancer.
.
#. CAD: As a pre-op clearance, a P-mibi was done and showed
severe perfusion defect of the inferior wall which is mildly
reversible at the apex and a moderate, reversible defect of the
inferolateral wall.  For this abnormal finding, the patient
undwernt cath which reveals stable lesions compared to the
previous cath in [**2123**] and no intervention was done.  The patient
was continued on BB, ASA, ACEI, and statin.
.
# CHF: EF was normal 54% per cath report on [**2125-2-19**].  The patient
likely has diastolic dysfunction.  The patient was continued on
BB, ACEI, and lasix maintenance dose after iv diuresis.
.
#. h/o lung adenocarcinoma: CXR showed irregular parenchymal
densities in R lung and vague opacity in L para-aortic area. CT
of chest without contrast however did not reveal any evidence of
recurrence.
.
#. Microcytic Anemia: The patient was on iron as an outpatient.
Hem/onc (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**] was consulted and the patient was found to
be vitamin B12 deficiency.  homocystein was normal and MMA is
pending.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic
disease +/- iron deficiency anemia in the setting of chronic
ulcer/osteomyelitis.  The patient was transfused 2 units in the
setting of hypoxia and anticipated surgery and hct increased
appropriately.  Guaiac was negative.
.
# Osteomyelitis: Pt admitted to podiatry for pre-operative admit
for amputation of right hallux. On admission, pt noted to have a
complex medical history. Pt noted to have non-palpable pulses.
NIAS obtained and pt found to have poor perfusions rate.  W-dry
dressign to hallux continued until furtehr intervention
possible. Pt remained on Unasyn while getting cardiac clearance
and resolution of hypoxia.  Once hypoxia resolved and cardiac
cleared, the patient was transferred to [**Last Name (STitle) **] Surgery service
for appropriate intervention.
.
#. DM: Hypoglycemia of 42 in the setting of change in diet and
NPO. The patient's pm NPH and standing regular were decreased to
10 and 12 respectively to prevent hypoglycemia.  (home dose NPH
15 am 20 pm, Regular 10 am, 15 pm)
.
#. HTN: Stable. Titrated up BB and ACEI for better BP control.
