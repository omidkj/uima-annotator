CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2146-8-21**] 7:39 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p bronch

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
29 year old man with fevers on abx w/ quadraplegia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p bronch
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW ON [**8-21**]

HISTORY: Quadriplegia status post bronchoscopy.

FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the
tracheostomy tube or left subclavian line. There is mild
cardiomegaly. There is ill definition of the left hemidiaphragm
in the retrocardiac regions suggesting volume loss/infiltrate.
There is vascular redistribution and pulmonary vasculature ill
definition suggesting fluid overload/CHF. Compared to the film
from the prior day, there is no significant interval change.

C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA [**1-6**] VIEWS P

Reason: eval C spine alignment, soft tissue swelling

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
29 year old man with s/p trauma with repaired C5 burst fx -
readmitted for sepsis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval C spine alignment, soft tissue swelling
HISTORY: Trauma with repaired C5 burst fracture readmitted for
sepsis, assess alignment and soft tissue swelling.

Cervical spine, four views. No previous post-operative cspine
xray on pacs record for comparison. Comparison is made to
[**2146-7-30**] cspine CT.

There is an anterior plate and screw transfixing the C4 through
C5 levels, with intervening fusion plug. No hardware loosening
or definite lucency about the hardware is identified. There is
marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling. A cerclage wire
extends posteriorly from C4 through the C6 spinous processes.
The [**2146-7-30**] CT scan showed a strut graft in this location,
though this is not well demonstrated radiographically (likely
due to technique and overlying structures). No listhesis is
detected through the level of C7. The lateral masses are
symmetric about the dens. Of note, the spinous process of C2 on
the dens view projects to the left of midline, though the
significance of this in this setting is uncertain. On the AP
view, some air projects to the right of the cervical spine, but
this may also lie within the piriformis recess.
The lung apices are obscured by overlying structures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post fusion procedure at C4/5, with posterior fusion
at C4 through C6. Posterior strut graft not well demonstrated,
likely technical. No listhesis or loosening detected. Subtle
lucency about the hardware would be difficult to exclude here.
2. Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling, more than on the CT
scan of [**2146-7-30**]. Differential diagnosis includes infection
and/or hemorrhage. The small locule of air to the right of the
cervical spine most likely represents air within piriform
recess; subcutaneous emphysema is considered less likely.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

CT NECK W/ & W/O CONTRAST; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: hematoma, abscess, edema
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
29 year old man with s/p c4 injury s/p ant fixation -- AP/lat
xray showed soft tissue swelling
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
hematoma, abscess, edema
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 29-year-old male, status post C4 injury and status
post anterior fixation of the spine. AP and lateral radiographs
of the cervical spine demonstrate a soft tissue swelling. Rule
out hematoma or abscess.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to CT of the cervical spine from
[**2146-7-30**].

TECHNIQUE: CT of the neck was obtained without and with IV
contrast. 100 cc of Optiray 350 were administered. Nonionic IV
contrast was used due to rapid bolus necessary for this study.

FINDINGS: The patient is status post anterior and posterior
fusion of C4/C5. The appearance of the hardware is unchanged
from the CT of the cervical spine of [**2146-7-30**] is unchanged. The
tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.The skeletal
structures are grossly unchanged. There is accumulation of fluid
in the prevertebral soft tissues anterior to the vertebral body
of C3 as well as C2. However, no definite enhancement is seen
around this fluid. Thi
