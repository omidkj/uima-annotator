History of Present Illness:
65F woman with history of etoh abuse, primary
hyperparathyroidism s/p resection for adenomas, and AF with
pacer presented with hypercalcemia and elevated troponin. She
was seen at [**Hospital1 **] today, initally stating she had back pain;
however, she was found to be confused. She had a steroid
injection in [**Month (only) 116**]. At [**Hospital1 **], patient was noted to have TropT

lasix and 2L NS bolus and transferred. Pt noted to not have
taken medications "in a long time."

Initial VS in the ED: 97.7 130/60 60 20 100ra. Exam notable for
normal rectal tone and moving all extremities. Labs notable for

= 112. Patient was given 1L NS infusing at 250cc/h. VS prior to
transfer: 98.0 129/65 62 16 100ra.

On the floor, 98.1, 131/70 53 18 100ra. Patient was lethargic
and confused.

ECG:
- [**6-24**]: Ventricularly paced rhythm. Occasional ventricular
premature beats. The underlying rhythm appears to be sinus with
A-V block. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

PATHOLOGY:

IMAGING:
[**2134-6-24**]
- Portable CXR: A pacemaker/ICD device has two ventricular leads
and a single right atrial lead.  The device projects over the
right upper hemithorax.  The heart is moderate-to-severely
enlarged.  The main pulmonary artery contour is prominent.  The
aortic arch is calcified.  The diaphragmatic contour on the left
is indistinct but the significance is difficult to judge given
cardiomegaly.  The lungs are difficult to assess in this area
and it is also difficult to exclude a small left-sided pleural
effusion.  However, there is no evidence for pleural effusion on
the right.  Otherwise, aside from streaky lingular atelectasis,
the visualized lungs appear clear.  Mild rightward convex is
curvature centered along the mid thoracic spine.  Surgical clips
project along the left axilla.
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat limited examination, but substantial
cardiomegaly
without definite evidence for acute disease.

[**2134-6-25**]
- Transthoracic Echo: Intravenous administration of echo
contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border
definition.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
Dilated coronary sinus (diameter >15mm).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Severe
global LV hypokinesis. Relatively preserved apical LV
contraction. Estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). No LV mass/thrombus. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Focal basal hypokinesis
of RV free wall.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications i
