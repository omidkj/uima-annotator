CT chest and abdomen [**2167-5-7**]:
1) Interval progression of disease, with [**Month/Day/Year 9140**] of hepatic,
osseous, omental, mesenteric, mediasatinal nodal, and possible
anterior abdominal wall metastases.
2) Pulmonary emboli involving the left main pulmonary artery and
segmental right lower lobe branches.
3) Right-sided concentric pleural thickening with small pleural
effusion. The consolidation and interstitial thickening at the
right base is nonspecific and may relate either to previous
pleurodesis or lymphangitic spread.


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 53-yo-woman w/ breast CA metastatic to liver
and lung, chronic right pleural effusion, and GERD who was found
to have a PE incidentally on CT.  She was managed in the ICU on
a heparin gtt and then transferred to the OMED service.
.
# Bilateral PE:  The pt was found to have pulmonary emboli
involving the left main pulmonary artery and segmental right
lower lobe branches. She was mildly tachycardic up to 120 this
admission. In the ICU she was started on a heparin gtt and then
she was transitioned to Lovenox on the floor.  Her Lovenox will
be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] after discharge. The pt was
instructed several times by nursing on self-injection of
Lovenox.
.
# Breast CA:  The pt has disease metastatic to liver, ab
wall/omentum, and lung. She was continued on Megace for appetite
stimulation, zofran for nausea.
.
# Gait instability/Deconditioning:  The pt worked with pt prior
to discharge, but she was unable to walk very far without having
to stop.  She was satting well on room air.  The pt does not
walk around her house much at baseline, and the pt wished to go
home with the assistance of her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] PT, home saftey
eval, a wheelchair, and home O2 were arranged for the pt.
.
#Hypercalcemia: Likely related to pts osteolytic lesions. PTH
was wnl. The pt received Zometa 4 mg IV x1 while in hospital.
.
#Tachycardia; The pt had sinus tachycardia throughout her
admission.  This did not resolve even after hydration with 1.5 L
NS.  She is likely tachycardic due to her PE.
