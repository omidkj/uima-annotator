History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14502**] is a 71yo man with HTN, COPD, and metastatic rectal
cancer to the bones admitted from clinic for upper back and
bilateral rib pain.  His pain has worsened over the last one
week since restarting capecitabine.  It is worse with movement
and inspiration.  He also has similar pain in the front of his
chest.  Fentanyl patch was increased from 100mcg/hr to 200mcg/hr
[**2144-5-20**].  In addition, he has been needing hydromorphone 4mg
every 3hrs for a few days, but this has been inadequate.  He was
in the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic due to a prerequisite for enrollment in
the Mersana clinical trial.  PET/CT [**2144-4-17**] showed progression
of disease.
.
ROS: He notes anorexia and night sweats.  He denies fever,
chills, N/V, wght loss, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, cough,
abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, hematochezia, melena,
hematuria, other urinary symptoms, weakness, or rash.  He has
chronic numbness in his feet.  All other ROS were negative.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
# Early stage lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node dissection in [**2134-9-6**] without
evidence of recurrence.
# Rectal Cancer: T3N2M0; diagnosed in 10/[**2140**].
- [**2141-9-6**]: the pt develops abdominal pain and lower GI
bleed, further investigation by colonoscopy reveals an ulcerated
4-5 cm mass in the mid rectum at 10cm, the pathology examination
of the biopsies shows poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- [**2142-3-7**]: the patient undergoes low anterior resection and
diverting loop ileostomy and mesenteric and periaortic
lymphadenectomy (T3N2M0, [**8-17**] lymph nodes involved, with a
distal
margin that was clear by < 1 mm, k-RAS wild time) after
completion of neo-adjuvant capecitabine-based chemoradiation
- [**5-14**] the patient started adjuvant therapy with FLOX (5-FU +
leucovorin 500 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, and 15 and oxaliplatin 85 mg
on
day 1,5 of four-week cycles).
- On [**6-13**]  a nonocclusive thrombus was demonstrated in the left
renal vein and the patient was started on anticoagulation.
- On [**2142-8-21**], he started cycle #4 of FLOX at reduced
dose of 5-FU 400 mg/m2 only on D1,15 and oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m2
on D1,15.  He subsequently completed two more cycles, the last
one being on [**2142-10-16**]. Therapy was also complicated by
the developments on oxaliplatin-related neuropathy involving the
palms, feet and distal calves.
- [**2142-7-7**] bone scan and spine MRI showed multiple bone
metastasis, in [**2143-6-6**] a bone scan and now CT scan torso
showed
progression of bone metastates, but no evidence of other site of
metastatic disease.
- [**2143-7-24**] start palliative chemotherapy with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
Irinotecan (350 mg/m2 q21d).
- [**2143-10-9**] CT TORSO showed increased sclerotic bony metastatic
disease unclear if due to disease progression or response to
treatment.
.
Treatment History:
06/09,16,23: C1 FLOX (5-FU 500 mg/m2 D1,8,21 + Oxaliplatin 85
mg/m2 D1,15).
[**2142-6-13**]: C2 FLOX.
*C2D1 changed from [**6-10**] to [**6-12**] due to development of
abdominal
pain and nausea. Urgent CT demonstrated nonocclusive thrombus of
left renal vein and interval enlargement of sclerotic focus in
left aspect of T12.
*Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 101702**] for neutropenic fevers (100.5, ANC
500,) LLQ pain, and dehydration. CT demonstrated small bowel
thickening suggestive of enteritis. Stool and blood cultures
negative. Discharged on course of Cipro + Flagyl.
[**2142-7-16**]: C3 FLOX.
*Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 101703**] for weakness, abdominal pain, and
increased ostomy output and dehydration. CT revealed epiploic
appendagitis.
[**2142-8-21**]: C4 FLOX (5-FU 400 mg/m2 D1,15 + Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2
D1,15).
[**2142-9-18**]: C5 FLOX.
[**2142-10-16**]: C6 FLOX.
[**2143-7-24**]: Start Irinotecan (350 mg/m2 q21d) x7 cycles.
[**1-/2144**]: Cetuximab added to irinotecan.
[**5-/2144**]: Restarted capecitabine.

[**2144-5-26**] MRI T-SPINE: IMPRESSION:
1. Significant progression of metastatic lesions involving the
thoracic and visualized lumbar spine since the previous MRI from
[**2142-7-30**]. Multiple sclerotic deposits are demonstrated
throughout the thoracic spine with diffuse involvement at
multiple sites.
2. Large epidural deposit causing cord compression is
demonstrated at T1 level. Several other epidural deposits are
seen, most prominent at T9 and T12 levels.
.
[**2144-5-27**] CT C/A/P: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of extensive osseous metastasis, most
prominently noted along the right rib cage, with expansile
osseous and soft tissue components. Small right pleural
effusion. Worsening of multilevel osseous metastases in the
spine as described. No acute pathologic fracture.
2. Unchanged small parastomal hernia, but without bowel
obstruction at the loop ileostomy in the right lower quadrant.
3. Stable presacral soft tissues.
.
[**2144-5-27**] MRI C/L-SPINE: IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple sclerotic metastases in the cervical, visualized
thoracic and lumbar spine.
2. Large epidural mass at T1 causing severe cord compression as
seen on the earlier thoracic spine study.
3. Small epidural deposit at T12 level indenting the dorsal
aspect of the distal cord as seen on the recent thoracic spine
study.
4. Small posterior epidural deposits at L2-3 and L3-4 levels
without canal compromise.
5. Minor degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine with
disc bulges, small protrusions and facet arthropathy causing
foraminal narrowing.
.

bones and left temporal bone with dural enhancement adjacent to
the bony metastases in the right frontal and left temporal
regions. S
