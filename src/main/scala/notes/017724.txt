Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Dehydration.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old man with metastatic esophageal
cancer to liver and lung presents from clinic with dehydration
and severe mucositis.  He is s/p initiation of cycle 1 of ECX
(epirubicin, cisplatin, and xeloda) on [**5-20**].  Since his
treatment, he has been feeling fatigued and developed a sore
throat and mouth sores.  He has been able to eat and drink
although drinking sometimes makes him nauseated.  He was
prescribed magic mouthwash and did not noticed much improvement.
 Patietn also states that he feels confused sometims and with a
slow mind. He had dairrhea in the morning with normal color, but
watery stool. He denies any sick contacts or exposure to people
in nursing homes, children or other infectious agents.
.
He had planned on coming into the outpatient treatment area for
IVFs, but because he has been feeling so unwell, he presented in
clinic today for evaluation.
.
In clinic, he was found to be orthostatic and appeared
dehydrated on exam.  He was noted to have oral thrush.  He was
given 2L NS, zofran 8 mg IV and nystatin 5 cc as well as
diflucan 200 mg. he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He is now being
admitted for rehydration and treatment of his mucositis and
thrush.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
He initially presented in [**11/2142**] due to dysphagia and weight
loss. At that time, he had a barium swallow, which showed a
pinpoint narrowing of his distal esophagus.  He had endoscopy
and underwent dilatation of this stricture.  He did not have
much improvement with the dilatation and in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year
underwent a second dilatation once again with no improvement.
He had motility tests, which were most consistent with
achalasia.  In [**Month (only) **], he underwent a Botox injection to the
narrowing in order to help to release it.  He had a CT scan
after this which showed a 1.5 cm gastrohepatic lymph node.  On
[**2143-8-28**] he underwent an upper endoscopy on which they saw
distal esophageal narrowing.  They also performed multiple
biopsies of the area of narrowing.  Of note, they saw some
ulceration in the GE junction and a thick abnormal fold
concerning for esophageal or gastric cardia cancer. The biopsy
showed moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  After
this he underwent endoscopic ultrasound, however, they were
unable to pass the ultrasound probe beyond the stricture.  He
has had a port, g-tube, and esophageal stent
placed.  He started treatment with 5-FU and Cisplatin on [**2143-10-10**]
with concurrent radiation therapy.  Radiation was completed on
[**2143-11-26**].  He was admitted from [**2143-11-26**] to the [**2143-12-3**]
with febrile neutropenia and dehydration.  He underwent an
esophagectomy on [**2144-1-20**].  Pathology from this showed a
metastatic adenocarcinoma with 4/6 perigastric lymph nodes
positive, and a separate foci of tumor in the adjacent adipose
tissue.  He completed treatment in [**2144-1-4**].  He had liver
lesions noted on a CT scan [**2145-1-16**].  He had these biopsied on
[**2145-1-27**] and the pathology came back as consistent with
metastasis from esophageal cancer.
.

of wine with dinner each night, but not since diagnosis.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**5-30**]:
1. No evidence of diverticulitis, abscess, or any acute
pathology to explain LLQ pain.
2. New wedge-shaped hypodensities within the spleen, likely
infarcts given relatively rapid appearance from the prior study.

3. Although incompletely assessed due to collapsed bowel,
apparent wall thickening of the ascending colon which may
represent bowel wall edema. No secondary signs of inflammation
(ie no fat stranding).

CXR [**6-3**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing
opacity
at the left lung base, combined with a newly appeared blunting
of the left
costophrenic sinus, presumably due to effusion. The size of the
cardiac
silhouette is unchanged. Unchanged normal right lung, unchanged
Port-A-Cath system.

CT chest [**6-4**]:
1. New diffuse transverse colon wall thickening and surrounding
inflammatory change consistent with colitis, only partially
visualized. Further evaluation with dedicated CT enterography of
the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained for further evaluation.
2. New, small left, and trace right, pleural effusions.
3. New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right lower lobe with mild
improvement in right upper lobe tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities. These
findings may be due to
aspiration.

TTE [**6-8**]:
No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study). Mild mitral
regurgitation. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.

RUE U/S [**6-8**]:
DVT involving the right distal brachial vein, as well as the
cephalic vein.

CXR [**6-9**]:
Compared to [**6-3**], there is more opacification in the left
lower lobe,
which could be worsening atelectasis or pneumonia particularly
due to recent aspiration. There has also been increase in
diameter of the cardiac
silhouette and the azygos vein which may indicate volume
overload but there is no pulmonary edema.
