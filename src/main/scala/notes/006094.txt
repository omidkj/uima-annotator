Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
70 y.o. female with CHF, HTN, DM who presented to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**]
Hospital after several days of dyspnea. Patient cannot quantify
how long she had been experiencing the dyspnea, but notes that
she has CHF and has been non-compliant with her medications and
diet. She does not weigh herself, though she reports that she
has not gained any weight. She reports increased LE swelling and
increased difficulty lying flat (though she still only sleeps on
2 pillows), but otherwise denies PND, fevers/chills, chest pain,
palpitations.
.
According to the patient's daugther and HCP, patient was
hospitalized approximately 4 weeks ago for recurrent bouts of
hypoglycemia, as low as 20s. She was hospitalized for
approximately 8 days, after which she was discharged to a rehab
facility for conditioning for 3 weeks. During this time, patient
was complaining of worsened LE swelling and inability to walk,
which according to the daughter, made it seem as though she was
not participating with PT and thus she was discharged from the
facility on the day prior to this admission. Daughter reports
that to the best of her knowledge, the patient had been given
Lasix while in the rehab facility and was eating a low-salt
diet, but that she was not being weighed regularly and her legs
continued to swell. While at home, patient began moaning and was
not behaving as she typically had. The daughter thus notified
EMS who initially recorded abnormal vitals of HR - 40s, BP -
78/p, FS - 67 and RA sat of 84% and brought her to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**]
Hospital. Given these vitals, she was shortly thereafter
increased to a non-rebreather and ER vitals approximately 8
minutes later were notable for: T - 94.2 (rectally), BP -
116/55, HR - 46, RR - 20, O2 - 99% on 100% NRB. A CXR was
suggestive of CHF and a UA was cloudy and concerning for
infection. She was given 60 mg of IV Lasix and nitro paste as
well as given Solu-Medrol and started on BiPAP. She was given
Ceftazidime and Ampicillin prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
In route to [**Hospital1 18**], BiPAP was ch`anged to CPAP as she was not
tolerating BiPAP. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was still
found to be hypothermic to 94.2, which improved to 96.3
(axillary) with the bear hugger. Labs were significant for no
leukocytosis and a lactate of 1.2 as well as presumed new renal
failure with BUN/Creatinine of 88/5.0 with an elevated troponin
of 0.05 with negative CKs and an elevated potassium of 6.2, the
treatment of which was deferred so as to avoid PO medications in
a patient who could potentially be intubated. EKG was without
peaked T waves. UA was grossly abnormal with 21-50 Epis. A blood
gas that was in fact venous demonstrated 7.27/38/57 on CPAP. She
was given an additional 40 mg of IV Lasix and started on a nitro
gtt prior to being admitted to the MICU for further management
of probable CHF exacerbation.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was resting with the CPAP
mask on, which she seemed to be tolerating. Her review of
systems was only significant for LE pain and dysuria.
.
Review of systems: As above. Otherwise, unremarkable

STUDIES:
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded (basal inferior wall not
well seen). Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was initially admitted to the hospital with shortness of
breath thought likely related to heart failure. She was diuresed
aggressively, although her creatinine then slowly increased and
had no further improvement in her heart failure symptoms. She
also developed atrial fibrillation with
