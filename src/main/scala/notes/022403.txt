HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 75-year-old
male with a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease,
with chronic lower extremity ulcers, coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve
replacement in [**2147-3-13**], who was transferred from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for fever, hypotension, hypoxia, and
elevated CKs for question of emergent cardiac
catheterization.  The patient presented approximately 24
hours earlier to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, where he complained of
two days of generalized fatigue and malaise.  He was noted to
have a fever to 102.8, with a blood pressure of 90/30 on
admission.  His chest x-ray was concerning for bilateral
infiltrate.  He was initially treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  This was then changed to vancomycin and
gentamicin.  He was initially on a dopamine drip for
hypotension, which was weaned after approximately ten hours.
He was then noted to have elevated CKs and troponin.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of approximately
40%, which was unchanged from prior.  He was started on a
heparin drip for concern for acute coronary syndrome.  By
report, he was approximately 2 liters positive from normal
saline resuscitation while in the Emergency Department at
[**Hospital1 1474**].

The patient was also noted to be anemic to 29 from a prior
hematocrit of 38 approximately ten days earlier.  He was
therefore transfused one unit of packed red blood cells, with
a resultant decrease in his oxygen saturations secondary to
possible pulmonary edema.  The patient was minimally
responsive to lasix at that time, and ultimately required
intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Following
intubation, the patient became progressively more hypotensive
and tachycardic, and was started on a dopamine drip again.
Electrocardiogram at that time revealed deepening of
anterolateral ST depressions.  CKs rose to 667.  The dopamine
drip was weaned off, and a Neo-Synephrine drip was started.
Cardiology was consulted, and a Swan-Ganz catheter was
placed, which revealed right atrial pressure of 20/4, right
ventricular pressure of 44/10, pulmonary artery pressure of
48/24, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22.  Three
sets of blood cultures were sent.  The patient had a
urinalysis which revealed moderate leukocytes and bacteria.
A urine culture was not sent.  Just prior to transfer, the
patient was started on a heparin drip.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], his blood
pressure was in the 80s systolic.  The Neo-Synephrine drip
was weaned off, and the patient was started on Levophed for
pressor support.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient has a smoking history of one

officer, and currently lives at home with his wife and has a
supportive family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, vital signs:
Temperature 101.6 rectally, pulse 63, blood pressure 86/49,
respiratory rate 12.  General appearance:  The patient was
intubated and sedated on arrival.  He withdrew to pain, but
was unresponsive to voice and touch.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Pupils were 2 to 3 mm and fixed.  The sclerae
were anicteric.  The neck was notable for a right internal
jugular with a Swan in place.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate,
with intermittent ectopy, a II/VI systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border.  Chest revealed a midline sternotomy
scar.  The lungs had bilateral mild coarse rhonchi on the
ventilator, with no appreciable wheezes.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, with active bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema.  The patient had bilateral
ulcerations with mild serosanguinous drainage over his medial
malleoli.  His left foot was notable for a black
dusky-appearing second toe.  His upper extremities were warm
and pink, although his lower extremities were cool
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white blood count 9.5,
hematocrit 30.4, platelets 260.  Sodium 135, potassium 4.9,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 24, BUN 46, creatinine 2.2, glucose
191.  Calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 4.7.  CK was 440,
with a troponin greater than 50, MB fraction of 40.  Blood
and urine cultures were sent at [**Hospital1 188**], which proved to be negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Patient with a history of coronary
artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft and
aortic valve replacement approximately two months ago.  He
presented with elevation in CKs and troponins, with evidence
of anterolateral electrocardiogram changes.  Admission
electrocardiogram was notable for persistent 1 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
depressions in V3 through V6, as well as T wave inversions in
I and AVL.  The patient's ischemic picture was thought to be
more consistent with demand-related ischemia in the setting
of his sepsis and anemia.  The patient had a normal cardiac
index.  Despite evidence of bilateral fluffy infiltrates
suggestive of congestive heart failure, the patient had a
normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, suggesting that
the pulmonary process was more likely acute lung injury vs.
adult respiratory distress syndrome in the setting of sepsis.
The patient was started on aspirin, and heparin was continued
for approximately 36 hours.  No beta blocker or ACE inhibitor
was given, given the patient's low blood pressure and pressor
dependence.  His CKs were cycled, and noted to trend downward
over the course of his hospitalization.

The patient had no episodes of chest pain or complaints of
shortness of breath, even following extubation.  Once his
blood pressure improves, the patient will be considered a
candidate for institution of beta blockade, as he was on 25
by mouth twice a day at home.

Regarding the patient's pump function, he was noted to have
an ejection fraction of approximately 40% by cardiac
catheterization in [**Month (only) 958**].  His ejection fraction was not
substantially changed according to echocardiogram report from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  As noted above, the patient had a normal
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and a normal cardiac
index, suggesting that he was not in cardiogenic shock, and
that his ischemic changes were most likely secondary to
demand.

The patient did have a repeat echocardiogram in the form of a
transeso
