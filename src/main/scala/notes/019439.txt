Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multiple CXR, Chest CT

History of Present Illness:
57 yo man with Parkinsons disease, L eye ptosis who presented to
OSH yesterday after 4 days of malaise, chills, subjective
fevers, cough and pleuritic pain.

Pt. was in USOH until last tuesday when he noted to feel weak
and tired.  Went to sleep early and noted chills and sweats as
he fell asleep. The next evening he developed nonproductive
cough, with resultant pain on the right side of his chest. This
worsened on Thursday and he could not fall asleep due to cough,
pain, and subjective fevers.  He noted that his breathing rate
increased and at that time also noted pain on coughing on the
left and worsening SOB. He saw a [**MD Number(3) 85311**] PCP's office on
Friday afternoon, who sent him to AJH.

On arrival AJH, his VS were 100.5F, 93/63, 18, 112 and 89% on
RA.  He underwent CXR which showed a large infiltrate in entire
RL.  He received CFTX and Azithro. His O2 requirement increased
to 6L NC and his SBP dropped to mid 70s systolic.  He received
500cc bolus w/o effect and was started on Levophed gtt once RIJ
was placed.  His labs were notable for WBC of 28K, 32% bands, Na
131, CO2 21, BUN 48 and Cr 3.1.  UA was notable for 5-10 WBCs,
WBC casts.  Given hypotension and increasing O2 requirements, he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T98 P105 BP117/70 R "20" 94%O2
sat on 4L NC. Pt. was given 1L NS, 2mg of morphine, place on NRB
and sent to the ICU.  Repeat labs as below.

On the floor, VS were [**Age over 90 **]F 124/84 104 28 92% on 6LNC.  He
appeared comfortable, but tachypneic, minimal use of accessory
muscles.  He is complaining of intercapsular pain.

Of note, he reports travel to [**Country 4574**] in [**3-8**], has not had his
PPD checked since that time.  Last PPD negative last fall after
trip to [**Country 84997**].  No sick contacts, no contact with prisoners.

IMAGING
[**2102-8-5**] RENAL US
NDICATION: 37-year-old man with suspected MI, now with renal
failure.

COMPARISON: No prior study is available for comparison.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 13.9 cm. The left
kidney measures 12.8 cm. Both kidneys are normal in appearance
without hydronephrosis, stones or concerning renal masses. The
main renal artery and main renal vein waveforms of both kidneys
are normal. The segmental arteries, renal arteries within the
upper, mid and lower pole of the right kidney demonstrate normal
waveforms with RI ranging from 0.53-0.66. The segmental arteries
of the upper, mid and lower pole of the left kidney demonstrate
normal waveforms and have resistive indices ranging from 0.57-
0.67. The bladder is empty with a Foley catheter in place.

IMPRESSION:
Normal sized kidneys with normal vascular flow. No
hydronephrosis or
concerning renal masses detected. Please note that
pyelonephritis cannot be
excluded on this study.

[**2102-8-7**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with pneumonia.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**8-4**] and [**2102-8-5**].

The right upper lobe consolidation appears to be grossly
unchanged since [**2102-8-6**] and potentially slightly smaller
compared to more remote comparison studies. The right basal
opacity that is inseparable from the inferior portion of the
right hilus is unchanged as well compared to most recent study,
but improved compared to [**2102-8-4**]. The left lung is
essentially clear as well as the very apex of the right upper
lung. Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion is most likely
present.

Overall, the findings are consistent with multifocal infection
that should be followed till complete resolution to exclude the
possibility of
post-obstructive infection.

The right internal jugular line has been removed in the interim.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

[**2102-8-9**] Chest CT
HISTORY: 57-year-old male with multilobar pneumonia, initially
showing
improvement on antibiotics, but with continued increased O2
requirement and
right pleuritic chest pain. Here to evaluate for extent of
pneumonia,
possible obstructive cause, or other etiology of symptoms.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest radiographs from [**2102-8-4**]
through [**2102-8-7**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest
initially using low-dose technique during full inspiration prior
to administration of IV contrast, and then during shallow
inspiration after the administration of 100 mL of IV Optiray.
Multiplanar reformatted images as well as bilateral oblique
maximal-intensity projection images were then obtained.

CTA CHEST: Pulmonary arteries are well opacified and there is no
evidence of pulmonary embolism. Atherosclerotic calcifications
are noted along the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Heart size is normal and there is no pericardial effusion. The
aorta is normal in caliber. Mediastinal nodes are subcentimeter,
not meeting CT size criteria for adenopathy.

The central airways are patent to the subsegmental levels
bilaterally. There is a large area of consolidation in the
posterior segment of the right upper lobe, consistent with
pneumonia, as seen on multiple prior chest radiographs.
Peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities are mild in the right
middle lobe. There are also ground-glass opacities as well as
consolidation in the posterior right lower lobe, which probably
represent combination of atelectasis and infection. Aside from
plate-like atelectasis at the lingula, the left upper lobe is
relatively spared. Consolidation in the basilar left lower lob
