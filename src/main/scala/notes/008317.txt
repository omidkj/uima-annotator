Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
lung abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
broncheoalveolar lavage

History of Present Illness:
71F with COPD, etoh hepatitis who presents as a transfer from
[**Hospital1 1562**] with lung abscess. She presented to [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**4-25**]
with 3 days of weakness, chills and purulent cough. She was
noted to be hyptensive in the ED and required vasopressin
initially. CTA showed no PE though showed a cavitary lung lesion
for which the patient was treated empiricially with ceftriaxone
and azithro at first though this was changed to
levo/clinda/zosyn. Over the course of the hospital stay,
infectious work-up was pursued. Thoracentesis was done which
drained 700ml fluid from the R side. RUQ US was pursued
revealing CBD stone with biliary ductal dilatation. On [**5-3**] the
decision was made to transfer the pt to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation of the cavitary lung lesion. She was intubated, by
report, for transfer and she was satting high 90s all day on 3L.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-5-4**] 9:36 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Large cavitary lesion within the right lower lobe. Comparison
with outside hospital studies would be helpful in evaluation of
evolution of this process. Given highly elevated white blood
count, an infectious process is highly favored and
necrotic/abscess transformation of focal pneumonia is likely. A
second differential diagnosis includes TB. A similar appearance
has been described post- radiation of an intraparenchymal tumor
focus, however, I believe, is much less likely.

2. Total body volume overload with large left pleural effusion
and moderate right effusion, ascites, and anasarca.

3. Right mastectomy and fiducial markers in the left breast
(oncologic history currently unknown). Soft tissue prominence in
the left posterolateral upper abdomen wall does not appear to
correlate on physical exam and may represent inferiorly oriented
breast tissue/skinfold.

4. Moderate-to-severe emphysema.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2174-5-4**] 10:06 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and small ascites identified.
2. Thickened gallbladder wall with a small gallstone identified.
3. No evidence of choledocholithiasis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-5-4**] 2:48 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:
There is a large ring shadow in the right mid lung, from 4 to as
much as 7 cm in diameter, with perimeter consolidation
suggesting a lung abscess or cavitary pneumonia, less likely
malignancy. Small left and even smaller right pleural effusions
are dependent. Consolidation at the base of the left lung could
be atelectasis or pneumonia. Heart size is normal. No
pneumothorax.
ET tube tip is no more than 25 mm from the carina. Left PIC
catheter ends in the upper right atrium.

.
RUQ u/s [**5-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the gallbladder with a small
gallstone but no signs of cholecystitis. No biliary dilatation.
Trace of ascites and right pleural effusion as seen before.
.
CXR [**5-12**]:
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube has been removed. There is
substantial increase to now large bilateral effusions. There is
new mild pulmonary edema. Cavitary lesion within the superior
segment of the right lower lobe is no longer appreciated;
however, opacity within the right upper lobe has increased in
size. No pneumothorax is detected.

IMPRESSION:
1. New mild pulmonary edema and significant increase in pleural
effusions.

2. Increase in right upper lobe opacity since previous study, in
which developing pneumonia is in the differential.

Repeat CT scan [**5-16**]:
1. Mixed response with decreased size of right lower lobe
cavitary lesion
but appearance of new nodular focus within the left lower lobe
and new patchy
lingular/middle lobe consolidations. Given the mixed response to
treatment, a
multiorganism process should be considered.

2. Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions with associated
relaxation
atelectasis.

3. New small pericardial effusion.

4. Diffuse pancreatic ductal dilatation only partially evaluated
on this
study. Further evaluation with MRCP should be considered if
clinically
appropriate to evaluate this finding.

5. Severe emphysema.

6. Secretions layering within bilateral mainstem bronchi
suggesting
aspiration or inability to properly clear secretions.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old female with COPD, ETOH hepatitis who presented as a
transfer from [**Hospital1 1562**] with a lung abscess. Hospital course by
problem:
.
1. Mechanical ventilation:  The patient was intubated at the OSH
reportedly for transfer, and was easily extubated after
obtaining a chest CT in the MICU. She was transitioned to 4L NC
before being called out the floor the day after admission.  She
was weened to room air.
.
2. Cavitary lung lesion:
Likely aspiration given history of alcoholism and failed swallow
study. No real risk factors for hospital acquired pathogens. Had
been afebrile since arrival from OSH.  At the OSH the patient
had 700cc pleural effusion tapped at OSH reportedly transudative
in nature without evidence of infection, cytology negative.
While intubated in the ICU, the
