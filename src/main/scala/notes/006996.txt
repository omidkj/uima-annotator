VITALS:  Afebrile, vitals signs stable.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. EOMI. PERRL. Nares clear.
Mucous membranes moist. Neck supple without lymphadenopathy.

sounds. No wheezing, rhonchi or crackles.
ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, with normoactive bowel
sounds. No masses or peritoneal signs.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary veins
identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire
is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre grafting: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Grafting: Patient is on Epi 0.02. Improved apical function,
LVEF 55%. MR is now trace. Aortic contours intact. Remaining
exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the
time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in
the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to oral
medication with adequate pain control on POD#0. The patient
remained neurologically intact and without change from baseline
during their stay. The patient remained alert and oriented to
person, location and place. Sequential neurologic exams were
repeated Q4 hours and were stable post-op.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable
intra-op and in the immediate post-operative period. He
extubated and was weaned from pressors.  He was transferred to
the surgical step down floor by the following day.  Chest tubes
and epicardial wires were removed.  The patient's
cardioprotective dose of Aspirin was continued post-op.
Coumadin was started for his history of strial fibrillation.

RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated in the immediate post-op
period successfully. The patient had no episodes of desaturation
or pulmonary concerns. The patient denied cough or respiratory
symptoms. Pulse oximetry was monitore
