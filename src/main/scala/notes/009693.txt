CXR ([**2133-10-9**])

FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable chest radiograph is
obtained. Low lung volumes limit evaluation. There is extensive
upper lobe and lower lobe opacity involving the left lung
concerning for pneumonia. There is likely underlying effusion.
Right lung is grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is difficult to assess with atherosclerotic
calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Bony structures are
grossly intact.

IMPRESSION:
Left-sided multifocal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o with Severe AS, CHF, h/o c diff, pemphigus vulgaris with
hypotension, fever with LUL infiltrate and sepsis.

The patient's symptoms were secondary to LUL PNA given cough,
fatigue, new onset infiltrate suggestive of aspiration PNA.
However, given the possibility of other sources of infection
(skin, urine, GI/ C.diff etc) pt. was pan-cultured.  There was
also significant degree of bandemia on CBC. Given nursing home
resident the patient was started on broad spectrum Abx coverage
for HAP with vanco, zosyn, Cipro. He was also started on Flagyl
for empiric coverage of C. diff.  The patient was also started
on stress dose steriods given chronic use of Prednisone in this
patient. Standing nebs were ordered. Per discussion with HCP and
family on admission, the patient was confirmed to be DNR/DNI,
but pressor use was allowed. Influenza DFA came back negative.
Urine Legionella negative as well.  Urine cultures and blood
cultures were pending.  Sputum grew normal oropharyngeal flora.
The patient was noted to have mildly elevated but stable
Troponins likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of
hypotension/sepsis and CHF.  He also had evevated Lactate levels
secondary to sepsis.

Due to worsening hypotension, aggressive resusitation with IVF
was started, while watching closely for signs of pulmonary edema
given severe AS and CHF. CVP remained 0-1 cm H2O despite
agressive fluid resuscitation, suggesting a profound vascular
leak.  Over the next day, the patient became progressively more
hypotensive and required increased doses of Levophed, which was
titrated to maintain MAP>65.  He was also becoming more
hypoxemic, requiring initiation of NIPPV.  Despite aggressive
treatment with antibiotics, fluid resuscitation and use of
pressors, the patient was becoming progressively hypoxemic,
hypotensive and oliguric.  A discussion was held with the family
to update them on prognosis, during which the decision was made
to make him comfort care only.  The NIPPV was discontinued and
the patient was switched to nasal canula for dyspnea.  He was
given Morphine as needed for comfort.  Pressors were withdrawn.
The patient went into asystole and passed away with his family
at the bedside.
