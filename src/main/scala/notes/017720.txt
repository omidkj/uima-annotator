Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 88-year-old who is
a retired former GM worker who has cardiac history that dates
back to [**2140**] when he was admitted to an outside hospital with
chest pain, shortness of breath and diaphoresis after
shoveling snow at which time ECG was consistent with an acute
inferior MI with a CK peaking at 1273 with 20% MB.  He was
originally seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5874**] in consultation in 10/98
complaining of dyspnea on exertion.

There is a chest x-ray from [**2154-5-19**] showing cardiomegaly
without congestive heart failure.  Chest x-ray in [**2155-8-11**] was consistent with mild congestive heart failure.

The patient was seen at an outside hospital on [**10-1**]
and admitted with diagnosis of congestive heart failure.  The
patient on [**10-15**] saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5874**] in the office and
reported feeling significantly improved since he started
Lasix after his hospitalization.

He denies any orthopnea, PND, palpitations or actual syncope,
although according to his daughter, he has fallen a couple of
times getting out of the bathtub.  He has noticed some ankle
swelling.  According to his daughter, the patient is
currently back to his usual baseline.  There is no history of
alcohol use.

An echo in [**2159-9-18**] demonstrated normal LV chamber size
and systolic function with mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy with dilated right atrium and left atrium with
moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation and
mild aortic insufficiency with at least moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant for atrial fibrillation.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Congestive heart failure.

The patient's work up revealed severe three vessel disease,
three vessel coronary artery disease with preserved ejection
fraction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2159-11-12**], the
same day as his surgery.  He was taken to the Operating Room
and a coronary artery bypass times three vessels was
performed.  The LMA was brought to the LAD, SVG was brought
to the OM, SVG was brought to the distal RCA.  Cardiac bypass
time was 79 minutes.  Cross clamp time was 41 minutes.

The patient was brought to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.  Patient on
postoperative day #1 remained intubated with a normal
arterial blood gas.  PH was 7.32, pCO2 of 40, pO2 of 152,
bicarbonate 22.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was extubated without
complication and maintained his oxygen saturation.  Patient's
urine output was maintained and he was diuresed with IV
Lasix.  Chest tubes were discontinued and the patient was
subsequently discharged to the Surgery floor.

Patient's postoperative course was complicated by occasional
rapid atrial fibrillation for which the patient was on
Inderal previously and was subsequently switched to Toprol 25
mg p.o. b.i.d.  He maintained his ventricular rate well from
the 70s to the 90s.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.
