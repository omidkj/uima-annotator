Imaging:
CXR [**2108-1-31**]: 1. Patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region,
which could represent an early focus of pneumonia. 2. Diffuse
interstitial fibrosis.
.
CXR [**2108-2-1**]: Right jugular CV line is in distal SVC. No
pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Allowing for this,
heart size is normal. There is a diffuse bilateral reticulo-
nodular pattern consistent with a known chronic interstitial
fibrosis. Discoid atelectases are present at the left base but
no definite new confluent pulmonary consolidation and no
pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2108-2-2**]: Developing multifocal opacities possibly
representing pneumonia. Edema is also considered.
.
CXR [**2108-2-3**]: Stable appearing multifocal opacities bilaterally,
concerning for pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2108-2-5**]: A single AP upright view at 12:00 hours is compared
to previous examination of [**2108-2-3**]. The lung volumes are
low. There are bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities with
small pleural effusions without significant change since the
previous exam. The findings are suggestive of pneumonia
superimposed on patient's known interstitial lung disease. There
is enlargement of both pulmonary arteries, indicating pulmonary
hypertension. Although the heart size is within normal limits
there may be an element of interstitial pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PNA: Ms. [**Known lastname **] likely had community acquired pneumonia. She
was ruled out for legionella and influenza, but was unable to
provide an adequate sputum sample to determine causative
organism. She was treated with ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime and
azithromycin, which covered her for encapsulated organisms
(patient is asplenic). She also likely had a component of
pulmonary edema, as she had received 4L of IVF on admission due
to her hypotension/sepsis. She began autodiuresing on her own,
and became I/O negative during her last several days of
hospitalization. She was able to be weaned off oxygen and her
sats remained stable on RA. She was given albuterol/atrovent
nebs for her breathing and robitussin prn for her cough.
.
# SEPSIS: On admission, she appeared to be in septic shock,
likely from her pneumonia. Despite receiving 4L of IVF in the
ED, she remained hypotensive and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on
levophed for BP support. Random cortisol level was normal, as
was a cortisol stim test, so she was not felt to be adrenally
insufficient. She was started on antibiotics (ceftriaxone and
azithromycin) with improvement in her hemodynamics. Blood and
urine cultures from admission showed no growth. The levophed was
eventually weaned and her BP remained stable. She was
transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the regular floor for continued
monitoring and weaning of her O2 requirement.
.
# ILD: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has known interstitial lung disease, with her
last pulmonary evaluation being in [**8-31**]. At that time, no
further w/u was pursued as she was asymptomatic. Per her primary
outpt pulmonologist, she has been admitted multiple times in the
past essentially for respiratory failure and has received
steroids with improvement in her symptoms. Pulmonary was
consulted once the patient was stablized on the floor but they
did not feel steroids were indicated at this time. Her O2 sats
were much improved, to 94-95% on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was continued on her
albuterol/atrovent nebulizers. She was switched to inhalers upon
discharge.
.
# CONJUNCTIVITIS: She developed conjuncitivitis and was treated
with erythromycin ointment starting on [**2108-2-6**].
.
# PAIN MANAGEMENT: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been on narcotics for chronic
back pain as an outpatient but they were held after the patient
was transferred to 11R as she began to develop an elevated
bicarb and it was felt that the narcotics may be contributing to
this. Her pain was adequately controlled with t
