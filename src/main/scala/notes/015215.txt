GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
This is a 87 year old man with history of EtOH abuse (last drink
6 months ago) with esopaphageal varices, previous dieulafoy
lesion now resolved, CAD, CHF (EF 45%), essential
thrombocytosis, Afib, HTN, type II diabetes mellitus, discharged
[**2137-8-3**] after admission for GI bleed, presenting from [**Hospital 4382**] with guiaic positive stool, delta MS.  The patient was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in [**6-9**] with CHF exacerbation and upper GI
bleed.  He was again admitted [**Date range (1) 95014**] with GI bleed.  EGD
at that time showed grade II non-bleeding varices at distal
third of esophagus.  He was discharged to home and since that
time has had continued black stools.  Today at [**Hospital3 **]
he was noted to be more lethargic and confused, and so was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
On presentation to ED T 97.0  HR 100 BP 130/70 HR RR 20  99%RA.
Initial Hct 15.5, and patient was transfused two units PRBC.  GI
was consulted, and patient was started on octreotide gtt.  BP
dropped to 108/60 as patient spiked temp 101.8 rectal.
Urinalysis was positive for UTI.  ECG 110bpm Aflutter,
borderline left-axis deviation, nml intervals, no ST-changes,
TWI V4-V6.  He denied recent fevers, headaches, dizziness,
visual changes, chest pain, palpitations, SOB, cough, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria.

Patient admited to MICU for emergent scope and received 6 PRBC
total.  Spironolactone, lasix, metoprolol, lisinopril were held
due to reflex tachycardia. ASA and plavix were held secondary to
possible GI bleed. EGD showed gastric telangiectasia which were
treated and showed esophageal varices intact. UTI and possible
pneumonia treated with Cipro. Hct has been stable today and
patient was transferred to the floor.


Past Medical History:
1. CHF - Right sided failure, LVEF 45-50% Intrinsic LV systolic
function depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation
from ECHO [**2137-6-21**] Previous ECHO w/ EF 30%
2. CAD - large reversable mod severe inferior wall defect by
pMIBI [**4-9**]; refused PCI [**4-9**] admission but was considering outpt
cath
3. Essential thrombocytosis - followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], on
hydroxyurea
4. Atrial fibrillation - was on coumadin but d/c'd by PCP
([**4-9**]) due to elevated INR and bleed
5. HTN
6. DM2, on insulin
7. H/O Dieulafoy's lesion w/ [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay ([**6-9**])

Social History:
Denies tobacco use. Extensive EtOH x 50 yrs, last drink 6 mo
ago. Lives alone. Has girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **] visiting nurse. Cooks for

[**Doctor Last Name 3077**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3060**].
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN PORT  [**2137-8-8**] 1:21 PM
Reason: eval for ascites, liver pathology. If ascites, please
mark
FINDINGS: There is a moderate to large amount of intra-abdominal
ascites present in all four quadrants.
An ink mark was placed over the pocket of ascites in the right
lower quadrant. The anterior abdominal wall measures less than 2
cm in thickness at that level and there is relying pocket of
ascites which measures over 5 cm in depth at that level.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-8-8**] 9:38 AM
Reason: r/o infiltrate
Comparison was done to the prior portable chest x-ray done
earlier today at 9:10 a.m.
There is mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion with left lower
lobe consolidation. There is mild cardiomegaly. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are normal.

[**2137-8-8**] EKG
Probable atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block
Incomplete right bundle branch block
Probable old inferior infarct
Anterolateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Since previous tracing of [**2137-8-8**], atrial flutter less apparent
