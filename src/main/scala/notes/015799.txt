Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation, Lumbar Puncture,
Percutaneous tracheostomy guided by bronchoscopy.
Percutaneous gastrostomy tube under direct
endoscopic guidance.


History of Present Illness:
41 y/o male with a history of polysubstance abuse, respiratory
failure [**1-21**] to overdose (intubated 4 times in the past) who was
found by his girlfried having difficulty breathing and
unresponsive. He was transferred to an OSH and given narcan
without improvement of mental status. He was subsequenlty
intubated due to poor mental status and concern for inability to
protect his airway. He had a head CT which showed cerebral edema
but no hemorrhage, mass lesions or acute infarcts were noted.
Due to the cerebral edema he was started on a mannitol drip and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. The duration of Mr
[**Known lastname 92560**] respiratory distress is unclear.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were:
T 103.8 BP 130/80 HR 120 RR 18 O2 100%
Repeat CT head was read as WNL. He was given Zosyn/Tobramycin.
Labs were notable for Trop 0.43, CKMB 47, CK 4518, Cr 2.2,
Lactate 4.1, K 5.7 and ABG (VBG?) 7.27/51/34. UTox was positive
for opiates and cocaine. EKG was notable for TWI in V1/V2, low
voltage in I/aVL, otherwise WNL. Neurology and Toxiciology were
consulted and the pt was admitted to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were:
T 104.2 BP 136/82 HR 110 RR 18 O2 Sat 100%
