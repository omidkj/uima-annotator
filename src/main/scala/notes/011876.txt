RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-2-9**] 8:41 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for consolidation

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with AS s/p AVR.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for consolidation
INDICATION: Effusion, followup.

PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to prior film from 2 days
earlier.

A tracheostomy tube remains in place. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are stable.

There is increased density in both lung bases, left greater than
right, consistent with bilateral pleural effusions. These appear
more conspicuous today, although it is uncertain whether this
reflects differences in patient's positioning (i.e. with more
posterior layering of effusions currently). Note that
superimposed parenchymal abnormality, including pneumonia,
cannot be excluded. More cephalad portions of each lung field
are clear.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right
(see above).

DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8889**]
Approved: SAT [**2137-2-9**] 3:26 PM





Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2137-1-15**] and had a cardiac cath on
[**1-14**] which revealed:
severe AS, mild pulm HTN, diffuse plaquing with ostial and prox.
30-40% stenosis, toherwise clean coronaries.  LVEF: 40% and
1+MR.  On [**1-16**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an AVR with a 21mm
[**Company 1543**] Mosaic valve.  Cross clamp time was 73 mins. and total
bypass time was 91 minutes.  He tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on Propofol and
Neo.  He was extubated on the post op night and remained on Neo
on POD #1.  His chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#2.
    POD #3 he had decreased urine output with a creat. of 2.8
and markedly elecated LFTs.  He was swanned and seen by the
renal and hepatology services.  He was started on Natracor.  He
also had several episodes of PAF, which he did not tolerate well
and was followed by EP.  He was treated at that time with
Procainamide because of his liver issues.  On POD#5 he was
reintubated for respiratory distress.  He continued to require
agressive respiratory therapy and continued to have arrythmia
issues.  Eventually he was briefly extubated and required
reintubation.  He underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement on
[**1-29**] and has been stable since that time.  He is now on trach
collar, but has secretions and requires frequent suctioning.
His renal and liver issues have resolved. He grew out staph
aureus in his sputum and has been treated with Vanco.  on POD#
27 he was discharged to rehab in stable condition.
