Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Dysarthria and left facial droop - code stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] is a 72 year-old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation supposedly on coumadin and hypertension who
presented to the ED with dysarthria and left facial droop. Her
symptoms were first noted at 3 pm when her daughter called to
check on her and noticed that she had slurred speech and
difficulty finding words. She asked her what she ate for
breakfast and she kept repeating "that thing...." Normally she
is alert and totally coherent. She had last seen her normal
yesterday. The sister went to Ms. [**Known lastname 18700**] house. The patient
also noted weakness in her right hand. She was brought to the
ED.

Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] any prior history of neurologic deficits. She
says that she takes her coumadin every day but she has ran out
of her Coumadin and was unable to take the medication recently.
She lives alone and takes care of all of her own medications.

Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] also [**Known lastname **] any prior history of heart problems
including problems with high heart rate or fluid in the lungs.
She says she is able to lie flat at night and never gets short
of breath.

In the ED, initial VS: 77 183/115 100%.  Code stroke was called.
The neurology team did not think she was a candidate for TPA
given her stroke score. Head CT showed no bleed, but while in
the scanner she developed afib with RVR into the 180s and then
developed respiratory distress. She was given 10 mg IV
metoprolol with little effect, then given 5 mg IV diltiazem with
improvement. Her blood pressure remained consistently >170
systolic. She required Bipap. She was given 20 mg IV lasix with
brisk urine output. She was transferred to the MICU for further
evaluateion and management. VS prior to transfer: HR 90s,
188/84, 26, O2 Sat 100% on [**10-31**] with 100% FiO2

On evaluation in the ICU, the patient is on BiPap. She states
that her speech has improved. She also says that the R hand
weakness is totally resolved. She [**Month/Day (1) **] shortness of breath,
recent cough, fever, chills. She further [**Month/Day (1) **] chest pain,
abdominal pain, dysuria.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Atrial fibrillation on warfarin but recently ran out of her
medication
3. Hypothyroidism

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] lives alone and manages her own medications and all
of her own affairs. She has never smoked and does not drink
alcohol.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
VS T 98 HR 94, RR 20, BP 176/74, 100% on bipap 10/5
Gen: Lying in bed, Bipap mask in place
HEENT: Pupils round and reactive
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruit
CV: Irregular, faint heart sounds
Lung: Clear
Abd: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Normoactive bowel sounds.
Ext: No edema, warm
Neuro: A&O to self, [**Hospital1 **] and date.  Pupils are nearly symmetric
although evidence of cataract repair in both eyes and reactive.
R facial droop with mild/moderate dysarthria. Able to close both
eyes fully.  EOMI.  Appears near full strength except for mild
FE weakness bilaterally.  No pronator drift and symmetric
reflexes throughout.  Sensation intact to LT and cold.

Pertinent Results:
[**2169-12-12**] 06:25AM BLOOD PT-21.8* PTT-33.3 INR(PT)-2.0*
[**2169-12-8**] 05:50PM BLOOD proBNP-1799*
[**2169-12-9**] 04:04AM BLOOD VitB12-317 Folate-17.3
[**2169-12-9**] 04:04AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.5 eAG-111
[**2169-12-9**] 04:04AM BLOOD Triglyc-48 HDL-52 CHOL/HD-3.3 LDLcalc-108

Echocardiogram [**12-11**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with borderline normal free wall
function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

MRI of head [**12-10**]: Likely subacute infarction within the left
frontal and parietal lobes, with the parietal infarcts having a
small hemorrhagic component

CTA of head and neck:
1. CT head demonstrates hypodensity in the right occipital lobe
due to
infarct of undetermined age. MRI can help for further
assessment. Diffuse
hypodensities are seen in the white matter including in the left
frontal lobe which could be secondary to small vessel disease.
2. CT perfusion does not demonstrate a definite territorial area
of
abnormality.
3. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates some tortuosity of
the left
vertebral artery which is small in size and could be due to
cervical
spondylosis.
4. CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of
stenosis or
occlusion.
5. MRI can help for further assessment to assess for acute
infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] is a 72 year-old right handed woman with atrial
fibrillation not taking her warfarin who presented with ischemic
stroke, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and flash pulmonary edema.


1. Acute ischemic stroke: No evidence of bleed on CT.
Transferred to neurology when MRI showed acute stroke of L
frontal/parietal lobe most likely embolic given her atrial
fibrillation and subtherapeutic INR.  Echocardiogram showed no
evidence of thrombus or ASD/PFO.  She was initially bridged with
heparin and INR was therapeutic (2.0) on the day of her
discharge.  Patient needs to continue Coumadin given her Afib
with goal INR between 2~3.0.  Lipid panel obtained and LDL 103
hence patient started on 20mg of Simvastatin.  INR will be
followed per PCP as before and patient has follow-up appt with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.

2. Flash pulmonary edema: Patient with new, sudden hypoxia in
the ED as well as exam findings consistent with acute pulmonary
edema. This was likely triggered by afib with RVR. After 20 mg
IV lasix in the ED she put out several liters of clear urine and
was quickly weaned off bipap and onto minimal nasal cannula
oxygen by the following morning.  TTE showed LVEF ~50%.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate:  She was
supposed to be taking both metoprolol and diltiazem at home, but
unclear if taking.  After improvement with diltiazem IV in the
ED, she was given an additional 10 mg IV lasix in the ICU
followed by 60 mg PO qid with improvement in the rate to
80s-90s.  Patient continued to do well with diltiazem on the
floor but may need to be further rate controlled with metoprolol
as outpatient.

4. Hypertension: She remained with systolic blood pressure
mostly 160-180, consistent with neurology recommendations.  She
was continued on Diltiazem on the floor but may need to be
restarted on metoprolol as outpatient for rate control as
needed.  HCTZ was discontinued but Irbesartan was restarted
before discharge.

5. Hypothyroid:  Home dose levothyroxine was continued.  TSH was
4.2 and the dose was not altered.

1.irbesartan [Avapro] 300 mg qd
