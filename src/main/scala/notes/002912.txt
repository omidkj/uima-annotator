Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
coffee-ground emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is an 81 year old female who presented from a
nursing home with coffee ground emesis on [**2192-8-19**]. The patient
was unable to provide a history due to dementia but the MICU
admitting team was able to speak to her nursing home who
provided the following history. Per her nurse she had several
episodes of dark, coffee-ground emesis on the day prior to
admission. She did not complain of abdominal pain. Per report
from her nursing home she also fell two days prior to admission
and hit her forehead (no further history on her fall available).
Per the patient's daughter at baseline, pt is minimally verbal,
able to answer simple questions and interject into conversation
but does not speak spontaneously and has significant word
finding difficulties. She adds that the pt has been less active
in the few days preceeding admission.
.
In ED her vitals were BP 132/50, HR 76, O2 sat 95% on RA. She
was found to have a hematocrit of 37. She received 1L of NS and
IV protonix. An NG lavage per report was not performed because
there was no evidence of active vomiting. CT of the head
revealed no evidence of acute bleed.
.
While in the MICU her vital signs have been stable. Her
hematocrit on admission to the ER was 37 on [**8-19**] at 12 AM. This
decreased to 29.8 at 6 AM, 27.6 at 12 PM and 30.8 at 12 AM on
[**8-20**]. At no time did she require transfusion. Bilateral lower
extremity ultrasounds were performed given assymetric lower
extremity edema which were negative for clots. She was started
on high dose IV PPI for her presumed GI bleed. She underwent CT
of the abdomen which showed a large hiatal hernia with a
thoracic stomach and no evidence of pancreatitis despite
incidentally noted elevated pancreatic enzymes. She was
evaluated by gastroenterology who plan for her to under upper
endoscopy tomorrow AM.

Imaging:
.
CT Head [**2192-8-19**]:
Despite repetition, some of the posterior fossa scans are
degraded by patient motion. Within this limitation, there is no
significant interval change seen compared to the prior
examination. Specifically, there has been no interval
development of an intracranial hemorrhage or overt area of acute
brain ischemia. However, if the latter diagnostic consideration
is a possibility, an MRI scan would be a more sensitive means
for detecting an area of acute infarction. The multiple areas of
chronic small-vessel infarctions previously described are
re-demonstrated. No other new extracranial abnormalities are
discerned, either.
.
CT Abd [**2192-8-19**]:
1. Intrathoracic stomach which may represent gastric volvulus.
If the patient is not symptomatic these findings may be related
to chronic volvulus.
2. No CT evidence of pancreatitis
.
Bilateral LE US [**2192-8-19**]:
Grayscale and Doppler examination of bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. Normal
compressibility, augmentation, waveforms, and Doppler flow is
demonstrated. There is no evidence of intraluminal clot.
.
Upper Endoscopy [**2192-8-21**]:
Findings: Normal esophagus, large hiatal hernia with [**Location (un) 3825**]
lesions, normal duodenum.
.
Upper GI with Small Bowel Follow Through [**2192-8-21**]:
1. Intrathoracic stomach with the pyloric at the level of the
diaphragmatic hiatus. No evidence of gastric outlet obstruction
or volvulus.
2. Small amount of barium aspiration noted in the central
airways. Followup chest x- ray is recommended if there is
concern for development of pneumonia.
.
Echocardiogram [**2192-8-22**]:
Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT Head [**2192-8-24**]:
1.  No significant interval change to brain parenchyma without
acute
hemorrhage identified.
2.  Slight decrease to predominantly left supraorbital subgaleal
hematoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 24831**] is an 81 year old female with a history of CAD,
atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement and dementia who
presents with evidence of an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
.
# Upper GI bleed: On presentation the patient had experienced
two episodes of coffee ground emesis at her nursing home.  She
has a history of esophagitis but otherwise no history of
gastrointestinal disorders or bleeding events.  In the emergency
room two large bore IVs were placed and she received IV fluids.
Her hematocrit on admission was 37.2.  This fell over the course
of the following day decreased to 27.1 but the patient did not
require transfusion.  She was hemodynamically stable and
asymptomatic throughout.  She was started on high dose
intravenous PPI therapy.  A CT scan of the abdomen was performed
in the emergency room which revealed the presence of a large
hiatal hernia with a complete intrathoracic stomach.  The
patient underwent upper endoscopy on [**2192-8-21**] which revealed no
obvious bleeding sources but confirmed the presence of the large
hiatal hernia with the presence of [**Location (un) 3825**] lesions.  Given that
her hematocrit had stabilized and there was no obvious bleeding
source on endoscopy no further workup was initiated.  She was
discharged on an oral proton pump inhibitor.  No further
episodes of bleeding were observed throughout this
hospitalization.
.
# Hiatal Hernia: The patient was noted to have a large hiatal
hernia on CT scan.  The presence of an intrathoracic stomach was
confirmed on upper endoscopy.  An upper GI with small b
