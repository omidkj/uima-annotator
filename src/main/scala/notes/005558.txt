Admission Date:  [**2191-5-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2191-5-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2142-7-25**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48 year old
male who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a
pericardial effusion and question of pulmonary embolus.  The
patient reports that he had been dyspneic for about 10 days
prior to admission.  About ten days prior to admission, he
developed symptoms of generalized malaise.  The patient then
went on a trip to [**Location 26355**], on return had noted
increasing shortness of breath.  This progressed to the point
that the patient was able to walk only 400 to 500 feet before
experiencing significant shortness of breath.  The patient
reports that prior to this, he had been in his usual state of
health.  He had an upper respiratory tract type infection
approximately one month prior.  Since this time, he has had a
persistent cough.

The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] where a CTA showed a
right lower lobe pulmonary embolus, in addition to a
pericardial effusion.  The patient was also noted to have a
heart rate to the 150's and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further care.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reported a history of a fast
heart rate in the past few months, for which he has been told
to lose weight but had reported to have a normal thyroid
function. The patient also complained of some cough and vague
epigastric discomfort but denied chest pain.  The patient
also complained of insomnia over the last several days but
denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.  The
patient also complained of lower extremity swelling.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cervical disease status post surgery times two.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
Ambien prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He is a bar owner.
He has three children.  He denies tobacco, denies alcohol
use; however, he does have a 25 year history of significant
second hand smoke.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient reports that his father had a
history of a stroke at age 75.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.0;
blood pressure 127/83; pulse 103; respirations 17; saturating
98% on three liters. This was a pleasant, middle-aged
gentleman, lying in bed in no acute distress.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.
Cardiovascular revealed tachycardia but regular, somewhat
distant heart sounds but normal S1 and S2.  Lungs were
notable for decreased breath sounds at the bases but
otherwise clear.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended,
with good bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm and well
perfused with trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count was 17.8;
hematocrit of 36.8.  CK was 387.  MB 18.  Troponin less than
0.01.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pericardial effusion:  The patient was found to have a
large pericardial effusion, without evidence of tamponade. He
had a pulse of 25, measured both by A line as well as by non
invasive blood pressure cuff.  The patient's pericardial
effusion was drained in the catheterization laboratory, with
the placement of a pig tail catheter on the morning of [**5-24**].  At this time, 700 cc of sanguinous fluid was removed.
The patient's pig tail catheter stopped draining fluid on the
subsequent day.  Transthoracic echo revealed clot versus
fluid.

On [**5-25**], the patient was taken to the operating room
for a pericardial window and biopsy.  The patient tolerated
these procedures well and his chest tube and pericardial tube
drains were discontinued on [**2191-5-28**].  The patient will
have a repeat echocardiogram on [**2191-5-30**] to ensure adequate
resolution of his pericardial effusion.  After drainage of
the pericardial effusion, the patient's pulsus resolved.

The patient had cultures both from original placement of the
pigtail catheter as well as at the time of the pericardial
window.  The cultures showed polys but no organisms and all
cultures remained no growth to date.  The sample sent for
cytology revealed inflammatory changes but no evidence for
infection and no evidence for malignancy.  The etiology of
the patient's pericardial effusion was deemed likely to be
viral, although malignant effusion was also considered.  On
chest CT, the patient had no evidence of lymphadenopathy and
no lung nodules.  [**Location (un) **] virus and HIV were pending at the
time of this discharge summary.  The patient will follow-up
with cardiology for further monitoring.

2.  Respiratory:  The patient had a persistent oxygen
requirement during his hospitalization.  Per outpatient
hospital CTA, he was reported to have a right lower lobe
pulmonary embolus.  The scans accompanied the patient and
radiology at [**Hospital1 69**] felt that
this was an inaccurate read of the original scan.  The
patient had a repeat CT angiogram to assess for pulmonary
embolus. The patient had a negative CT angiogram on [**5-24**].  A repeat chest CT performed on [**5-27**] confirmed
interval increase of bilateral pleural effusions.  There was
no evidence for pneumonia on chest x-ray nor on chest CT.

The patient's oxygen saturations improved with incentive
spirometry and increased ambulation.  The patient will be
followed closely as an outpatient and should have further
pulmonary testing performed as an outpatient.

3.  Cardiac rhythm:  The patient was admitted in atrial
flutter, with a rate in the 150's.  The patient had an
episode of diaphoresis during this and received Diltiazem
with return to sinus rhythm.  The patient had no further
episodes of atrial flutter on this admission.  The patient
did have sinus tachycardia of unclear etiology.  His thyroid
function tests were normal and there was no evidence of a
pulmonary embolus.  The patient was rate controlled with
Lopressor which was titrated to blood pressure and rate.  The
patient was started on aspirin given his history of atrial
flutter.

4.  Infectious disease:  The patient was admitted with an
elevated white count and had a temperature spike to 102.  The
patient had cultures which all remained no growth to date at
the time of this discharge summary.  His temperature curve
and his white blood cell count were trending down at the time
of discharge and he remained off antibiotics.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pericardial effusion.
2.  Pleural effusion.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
2.  Toprol XL 150 mg q. day.
3.  Ambien prn.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow-up with his primary
care physician in the week following discharge.  In addition
to this, the patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 171**] of cardiology.
