There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right. There is no pulmonary edema or focal infiltrate. Lungs
are hyperinflated from COPD. Wedge compression fracture of the
mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged from [**2195-3-13**]. The heart

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No
spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV
cavity size. Moderate global LV hypokinesis. Moderately
depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Moderate AS. Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Abnormal mitral
valve. Moderate (2+) MR. Eccentric MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The rhythm appears
to be atrial
fibrillation.

Conclusions:
PRE BYPASS
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
moderately depressed with LVEF 35-40%. . Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
aortic valve
stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] 1.0-1.2 cm2 by continuity equation. Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened with
bileaflet prolapse... Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen
with
SBP~110mm Hg. The mitral regurgitation jet has an eccentric jet
component as
well as a central jet. MR [**Name13 (STitle) 97400**] when SBP was increased to
140 mm Hg.

POST BYPASS
LV systolic function improved, LVEF~ 50%. There is a well seated
well
functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There is trace
valvular AI.
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7968**] to mild to moderate (Central jet no longer
visualized/eccentric jet remains). The left atrial appendage is
no longer
visualized. Remaining study is otherwise unchanged from
prebypass

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38711**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-3-17**] for further
management of his chest discomfort. He was taken to the
catheterization lab where he was found to have left main and
three vessel disease, with moderate aortic stenosis. Given the
severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical revascularization and valve replacement.
He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. An LVgram on
cardiac cath showed restiing hemodynamics demonstrated normal
right sided pressures, normal pulmonary pressures, and mildly
elevated left sided pressures(LVEDP 17 mmHg) with a 39 mmHg
gradient across the aortic valve ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9
cm2) and normal cardiac index (2.4 l/min/m2) consistent with
moderate
aortic stenosis.   On [**2195-3-17**], Mr. [**Known lastname 38711**] was taken to the
operating room. An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram
revealed severe aortic stenosis thus he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to two vessels and an aortic valve
replacement using a 23mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial model
2800 bioprosthesis. Postoperatively he was take
