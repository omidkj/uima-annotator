Chief Complaint:
Chest [**Hospital 22556**] transfer from [**Hospital1 1516**] for pericardial tamponade,
s/p pericardial drain placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardial drain placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 61 year old woman with hx of ulcerative
colitis/Crohns, recent DVT, who presented with chest discomfort
initially, found to have pericardial effusion increasing in
size, who was transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for
overnight monitoring s/p placement of pericardial drain for
pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with pneumonia, for
which she was treated with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin. Patient
was noted to have small pericardial effusion at that time with a
pulsus paradoxus of <10mmHg, felt to be stable. She was also
diuresed for volume overload, and her TPN volume was decreased.
She was discharged on [**2-5**].
Patient returned to hospital on this admission because of
temperature to 100.1F and was found to have pericardial effusion
markedly incrased in size. On presentation to floor, patient did
complain of tugging sensation in her chest, muscle aches and dry
cough and reported having had these symptoms on discharge from
previous hospitalization. She does report diarrhea but unchanged
from her normal diarrhea associated with her IBD. She was ruled
out for influenza on the floor. She denied chills, sore throat,
runny nose, headache, abdominal pain or SOB. She denied
hematochezia or melena. She admitted to intermittent swelling of
her legs for past two years, which she attributed to her gout
initially.
Echocardiogram this morning was similar to previous Echo
yesterday, showing large free-flowing pericardial effusion with
RV invagination and diastolic collaps, evidence of cardiac
tamponade. Patient was taken to Cath lab for placement of
pericardial drain. Right Heart Cath showed equalization of
pressures in RA, PCWP, and Pericardial Pressure at 20mmHg,
suggesting tamponade physiology. 450cc serosanguinous fluid
drained from pericardiocentesis, fluid sent for studies, drain
left in place, and patient transferred to CCU for further
monitoring.
On transfer to CCU, she appears to be comfortable and stable. No
complaints of chest discomfort, just has mild lower back pain
from positioning in bed.

Past Medical History:
1. Crohn disease diagnosed in [**2159**], in the past she had surgery
due to bowel obstruction requiring a 40-day stay including ICU
management. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**]. Currently, on
Remicade infusions every 8 weeks and started on TPN [**12/2184**]
2. Gout. Present in left toes and ankles.
3. Pseudogout.
4. Tubal ligation in the past.
5. Osteoporosis. Recent bone scan shows severe osteoporosis,
not taking bisphosphonate currently.
6. Several abscesses in teeth requiring teeth extraction, likely
secondary to Remicade infusion.
7. Hammertoes.
8. Elbow pain requiring surgery.
9. Asymptomatic kidney stones.
10. Fracture of ribs from coughing.
11. Depression
12. Hypothyroidism
Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

Social History:
Retired, worked for election department. Currently lives with
son and son's father (ex-husband). Needs help with almost all
ADLs. States she would probably not be alive without other's
assistance. Diet: Eats what is tolerated. Tobacco, quit last
month. smoked about pack/day for about 40 years. Alcohol,
denies.

Family History:
Positive for diabetes, gout. Negative for inflammatory bowel
disease or GI cancer. Father had heart disease, mother had [**Name (NI) 2320**]
and HTN.

PERICARDIUM: Large pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. Stranding is visualized within the pericardial
space c/w organization. RV diastolic collapse, c/w impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
Conclusions:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The right
ventricular cavity is small with borderline normal free wall
function. There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w organization. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2185-2-4**], the size of the pericardial effusion is
markedly increased. Echocardiographic evidence of cardiac
tamponade is now present.
.
Echo [**2185-2-15**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
RV with normal free wall contractility. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-14**], the
effusion appears slightly smaller.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yoF with h/o Crohn's disease, recent DVT on Lovenox, bilateral
pleural effusions, large pericardial effusion seen on echo with
echo evidence of tamponade physiology; also with leukocytosis,
low grade fever, paroxysms of AFib seen on telemetry on
presentation.

# Pericardial Effusion:
The patient had a recent chest CT and previous echocardiograms
showing evidence of a pericardial effusion.  However, the
effusion appeared larger on initial bedside TTE in the ED
(moderate to large in size).  Clinically the patient appeared
well with stable bp's and pulses with pulsus paradoxus [**7-26**].
However, given echocardiographic findings suggestive of early
tamponade phsyiology, pt underwent placement of a pericardial
drain.  The patient was transferred to the CCU post-procedure
for monitoring with continued significant drainage initially
which tapered off.  After the drain was pulled, she had two
serial TTEs which did not show reaccumulation of pericardial
fluid.  The pericardial fluid showed WBC 111 (Polys 60, Lymphs
30, Monos 10), Hct 12 with negative cytology and negative
cultures to date (acid fast smear negative but acid fast and
fungal cultures still pending).  Rheumatology was consulted for
a high [**Doctor First Name **] titer (1:1280), positive dsDNA.  Given tha positive
anti-histone antibody, the most likely cause of the pericardial
effusion is believed to be drug-induced SLE, likely secondary to
infliximab.  The patient's GI specialist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**], was
notified that the patient should have her infliximab
discontinued indefinitely.  Her pulsus paradoxus was 6 for two
days following transfer from the CCU to the floor.  The patient
had a TTE on [**2-21**] ~1 week following her pericardial drain, which
showed continued resolution of the pericardial effusion.  She
will need another TTE around [**3-15**] to follow up and ensure the
continued resolution of the pericardial effusion, and was
notified of this prior to discharge.
