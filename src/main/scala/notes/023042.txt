intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2749**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yoF with severe diastolic HF NYHA class IV
with multiple exacerbations in past year, HTN, HLD, Afib, and
gait abnormality related to ?DM who presented from home on [**2-13**]
after sustaining a fall 3 day before. Her fall was unwitnessed,
but was thought to be mechanical, as pt tripped while getting
out of bed to the commode.  L hip pain developed over the next
few days, and her family brought her to the ED.  CT scans of the
cervical spine and head were negative for fracture or bleed. A
plain film of the hip showed chronic fractures of the left
superior and inferior pubic rami but no new fractures.  UA was
concerning for UTI, she was started on macrobid.  She was
subsequently transferred to the floor.
.
On transfer to the floor, her VS were 98.2 128/70 98 18 98/4L.
She was without acute complaints initially.  Her antibiotics
were broadened to linezolid and cipro on [**2-15**].  On the evening
of [**2-15**], she triggered on the floor for desaturation to 88% on
2-3L; came up to 94-95% with 5L O2.  At baseline, she is in the
low 90s on 2-3L at home.  She got lasix 60 IV x1 (takes
torsemide 100 [**Hospital1 **] at home, but has been off since presentation
due to hypotension), mucomyst, morphine 0.5, and nebs. Repeat
lasix 40mg IV x1.  ABG 7.51/45/51/37. HR was noted to be in the
120-130s (home B-blockers also stopped secondary to
hypotension), got lopressor 5mg IV x 2 with little effect.
Attempted to put her on face mask for mouth breathing, but
patient kept ripping it off.  Pt was also complaining of chest
pain, and was felt to have altered mental status and increased
agitation.  Pt was trasferred to the MICU for further
management.

Of note, she is [**Hospital1 **] speaking only; per her daughter, she has
not had any decreased interaction or confusion. The patient
lives in subsidized senior housing and has 24/7 care. The
daughter notes a slow decline in her functional status since a
[**2169**] admission for MRSA pneumonia in which she was
temporarily intubated. She was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 1096**] for
CHF, and per the daughter, has not fully recovered functionally
since. She has had multiple previous falls in the past related
to neuropathy and already unsteady gait.

Past Medical History:
- Chronic diastolic heart failure, last EF 65% ([**7-/2168**])
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Atrial fibrillation (not anticoagulated due to fall risk)
- Microvascular disease

Social History:
Patient lives at home by herself at subsidized senior housing in
[**Location (un) **] with assistance from family. She has a 24 hour care
worker that watches her 5 days a week. Her daughter watches her
the other 2 days each week. Her Grandson [**Name (NI) 382**] is an interpreter
at [**Hospital1 18**] and is very active in her care. Granddaughter is ?also
HCP. Aids help her with cleaning and shopping. No smoking or
drinking.

EKG [**2169-2-13**]:
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Variation
in precordial lead placement as compared to the previous tracing
of [**2169-1-14**]. The inferior ST-T wave changes are slightly more
prominent. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

TWO VIEWS OF THE LEFT TIBIA AND FIBULA [**2169-2-13**]: Diffuse
demineralization limits [**Month/Day/Year 2742**] of the osseous structures. No
fracture or dislocation is present. The left knee is partially
imaged and demonstrates mild-to-moderate degenerative changes
within the medial and lateral compartments. No focal lytic or
sclerotic osseous abnormality is seen. There are no radiopaque
foreign bodies. No focal lytic or sclerotic osseous
abnormalities are present.
.
PELVIS PLAIN FILMS [**2169-2-13**]:
Limited [**Month/Day/Year 2742**]. Chronic fractures of the left superior and
inferior pubic rami. No definite new fractures seen. If there is
continued clinical concern for a pelvic fracture, a CT of the
pelvis can be obtained for further [**Month/Day/Year 2742**].
.
CT C-SPINE [**2169-2-13**]: preliminary read shows no fracture or
subluxation of the cervical spine
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2169-2-13**]: preliminary read shows no acute
intracranial pathology, chronic small vessel ischemia and
atrophy stable. Sinus mucosal thickening new compared with
prior, correlate for sinusitis
.
CXR [**2169-2-13**]: No acute traumatic injury identified. Enlargement
of the hila likely reflective of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension. Hiatal hernia with adjacent atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine Floor Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2749**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo [**Age over 90 595**]-speaking female with severe dCHF,
HTN, HLD, neuropathy, gait abnormalities who presents 3 days
after likely mechanical fall without evidence of significant
trauma.

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  She developed hypoxia to the low 80s on
3LNC on HD3 with significant resipiratory distress and
tachypnea. CXR showed mild fluid overload.  She was given
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers and IV lasix with
rebounding of her sats to the upper 90s on 5LNC. She was
agitated and refused to wear an oxygen mask or complete her neb
treatments.  She calmed with IV morphine which likewise lessened
her tachypnea.  She again decompensated with respiratory
distress that evening and was subsequently transferred to the
ICU for further care. The etiology was felt likely combination
of pneumonia plus flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
elevated HR in DHF, also possible aspiration in the setting of
AMS. Pt was intub
