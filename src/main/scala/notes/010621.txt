Pertinent Results:
[**2157-12-13**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe valvular mitral
stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post bypass: there is a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral
position with peak gradient [**11-14**], mean [**3-8**] and no perivalvuar
leaks. There is a mechanical prosthesis in the aortic position
with peak gradient 14, mean 4 mm hg. Aortic contours intact. LV
function preserved. Remaining exam unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

[**2157-12-12**] CT Scan
No pulmonary nodules or masses identified. Previously noted
nodular opacity at the left lung apex likely represents a
confluence of shadows.

Reason: eval for effusion
Final Report
HISTORY: AVR.

Two views. Comparison with the previous study done [**2157-12-17**].
There is
continued evidence of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Streaky bilateral
densities consistent with subsegmental atelectasis are improved.
The left
costophrenic sulcus is blunted. The patient is status post
median sternotomy,
MVR and AVR. Mediastinal structures are unchanged. A right
jugular sheath
has been withdrawn.

IMPRESSION: Continued evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Blunting of
the left costophrenic sulcus consistent with a tiny effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-12-12**] for surgical
management of her valve disease. She was placed on heparin as
she had been off her coumadin for 4 days. She was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. Dental clearance was obtained. On
[**2157-12-13**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent an Aortic and mitral valve replacement using
mechanical prosthetic valves. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 128
minutes. Cross Clamp time= 110 minutes. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. Over the next several hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty. She
was noted to be slightly lethargic initially however she quickly
cleared. Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. Coumadin was
started for anticoagulation for her mechanical valves and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She was transfused for
postoperative anemia. A bedside swallowing exam was obtained
given her history of past stroke and her lethargy initially
postoperatively. She was noted to swallow without issue. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.  On
[**2157-12-17**], she was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
evaluation of her postoperative strength and mobility. She
continued to make steady progress and was discharged to Bear
[**Doctor Last Name **] rehabilitation on postoperative day# 7. Her coumadin will
be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17825**] for a goal INR of 3.0-3.5 once
discharged from rehab. All follow up appointments were advised.
