CT of [**5-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Findings highly suggestive of ischemic small bowel
with evidence of free mesenteric fluid and free air, with
dilated wall thickened loops. There is no evidence of venous or
arterial occlusion. These findings were discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 955**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43107**] at 10:00 p.m. on [**2182-5-11**].

CT [**5-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Considerable improvement of previously described
abnormal left lower quadrant loops of small bowel, which now
demonstrate less inflammatory changes, and no definite evidence
of free air or pneumatosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to surgical service through ER. Given ominous CT
findings and concerning physical exam, she was watched closely
through the initial phase of her admission. Of great concern to
the surgical team was the patient's initial refusal of the
nasogastric tube. However, she was subsequently persuaded of the
necessity of the nasogastric tube, and it was successfully
placed with good relief of the patient's pain. The team was in
constant contact with Dr [**Name (NI) 957**], in discussions of whether or
not an emergent operation was needed. As the patient stabilized
it was felt that an operation could wait. She was maintained in
the SICU with vigorous resuscitation and serial abdominal exams.
Her pattern of tenderness did not significantly change. She was
started on intravenous antibiotics. A repeat CT scan on [**5-15**]
showed significant improvement. It became apparent that the
patient would need parenteral nutrition, and a central line was
placed on [**5-16**]. She continued to improve, and on [**5-20**] was
trialed on sips of clear liquids, which she tolerated well. Her
diet was advanced in a slow and stepwise fashion, and by the
evening of [**5-23**] she was tolerating a regular diet without pain,
nausea, or bloating. She was discharged to home on [**5-24**] in good
condition.
