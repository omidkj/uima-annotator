DISCHARGE SUMMARY ADDENDUM: On the day that we anticipated
the patient to be transferred to rehabilitation, she became
acutely more short of breath with an increased oxygen
requirement. In addition she had a new left lower lobe
infiltrate that was interpreted as a consolidation versus
atelectasis. In addition her white blood cell count surged
from 7,000 to 27,000. For this reason we believe she had
developed acute pneumonia. She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit for aggressive pulmonary toilet and close
observation.

Over the course of the following two days her white count
improved. She remained afebrile and her pulmonary status
improved. Her diuretics were adjusted from 40 of Lasix [**Hospital1 **] to
20 of Lasix [**Hospital1 **] as around the time of this episode her
creatinine spiked from 1.4 to 1.9. This improved by the time
of her discharge back to a baseline creatinine of
approximately 1.5. While she was in the Intensive Care Unit
she had further episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
For this reason the decision was made to finally
anticoagulate her. She was started on 2.5 mg of Coumadin po q
HS. This will need to be adjusted once she goes to
rehabilitation.

On [**2148-5-6**] the patient was transferred out of Intensive
Care and the following day was stable enough to be discharged
to rehabilitation. She was discharged to the [**Hospital3 38761**]at [**Location (un) **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
3.  Amiodarone 200 mg po bid.
4.  Zantac 150 mg po bid.

9.  Atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffs q four hours prn.
10. Coumadin 2.5 mg po q HS.
11. Levaquin 250 mg po q day.

The rehabilitation staff was advised that in approximately
one week they will need to reevaluate her need for Lasix and
potassium in addition she may need to restart her Ace
inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide. Finally her primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30442**] was telephoned at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 27541**]. He was told that the patient was being
discharged on Coumadin and he will be following up with the
rehabilitation center team to ensure that her outpatient
anticoagulation is correct.
