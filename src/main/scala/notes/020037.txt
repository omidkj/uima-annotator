shortness of breath

none


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 30258**] is an 80yo woman with pmh significant for chronic
systolic congestive heart failure, LVEF 20%, presenting to ED
from nursing home after becoming acutely short of breath in the
morning of admission. The on-call physician at the nursing home
gave the patient lasix 80mg IV, albuterol, and morphine prior to
transfer. No foley was placed, however, upon arrival to ED the
patient's sheets were soaked with urine. In ED, patient was
tachypneic with RR in 40's and had oxygen saturation of 88% on
NRB. BNP was 26,000, CXR showed bilateral infiltrates. She was
also hypertensive with BP 160/100 and tachycardic to 120's. EKG
showed LBBB with lateral depressions. She was given
nitroglycerin and placed on Bipap. She responded with O2
saturation of 98%, respiratory rate of 16, and her blood
pressure and heart rate decreased to 110/60 and 60-70's
respectively. Her ekg changes returned to baseline. Attempts
were made to wean her form Bipap to NRB and venti mask, and were
unsuccessful secondary to O2 desaturation and tachypnea.
.
The patient has had multiple CHF exacerbations recently, which
have all been handled at [**Hospital **] rehab. Per the patient's PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been decompensating somewhat with diminished PO intake.
The patient had an [**Name10 (NameIs) 10718**] of shortness of breath at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab on [**2-7**] which reoslved with lasix 90mg IV and morphine. She
was "Do Not hospitalize" status 1 week ago, however, given the
difficulty of treating her CHF exacerbations overnight without
doctors on [**Name5 (PTitle) **], it was decided to revoke the "DNH" status for
the purposes of transferring the patient to the hospital in the
event that an exacerbation would occur overnight and no MD's
were avaliable to push IV lasix.
.
Review of symptoms is answered by her son. [**Name (NI) **] has
expressive aphasia.
Also notable for absence of fever, chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25
%) with inferior, anteroseptal and apical akinesis/severe
hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-8-5**],
findings are similar.

RADIOLOGY:
.
CXR ([**2177-2-11**])
IMPRESSION: Regression of pulmonary vascular congestion during
the last one day interval. Sizable left-sided pleural effusion
persists. No evidence of pneumothorax or new localized
infiltrates. As shown earlier, there is a moderately compressed
vertebral body at level T12.
.
CXR ([**2177-2-13**])
IMPRESSION: Interval development of mild-to-moderate right
pleural effusion, and slight interval decrease in
moderate-to-severe left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 30258**] is an 80 year-old woman with chronic
systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with shortness of
breath.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: History
and presentation consistent with CHF exacerbation - LVEF 20%,
BNP 26,000 on admission, lung exam with crackles, CXR w left
pleural effusion/congestion. Unclear etiology of CHF
exacerbation, possibly from upper respiratory infection vs
uncontrolled hypertension (a few SBPs in 140s-150s). Dietary
indiscretion and medication non-compliance are likely not causes
given patient is presenting from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Cardiac ischemia
ruled out with negative biomarkers. Pt was diuresed w furosemide
80mg IV at first for a goal of -1L/24hrs, then with furosemide
with HCTZ 30 minutes prior, as pt stopped responding to
furosemide only. Total net -2L in 2 days. Pt improved
clinically. PICC line placement was deferred to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Was transferred back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on losartan, metoprolol,
furosemide, HCTZ.  She will need electrol
