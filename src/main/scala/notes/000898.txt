Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left mainstem stent placement [**2101-7-11**] by Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1151**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3373**]

History of Present Illness:
55 y/o male history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer,
consistent with squamous cell s/p chemotherapy and radiation
treatments as well as mutliple prior bronchoscopies with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3373**] for tumor debulking and stent placement to the left
mainstem bronchus who now presents with shortness of breath. The
patient lives in [**State 5111**], but receives his pulmonary care
here in [**Location (un) 86**]. He is in [**Location (un) 86**] for a stent placement however,
before a scheduled appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3373**] he presented this
morning with acute onset of shortness of breath and chest
tightness. EMS was called and found patient saturating 50% on RA
with intense tachypnia. Patient was placed on his home O2 of 3 L
which increased his saturations to about 70%. He was
transitioned to NRB with 90% saturations and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In ED initial VS were HR 95, BP 123/73, RR 24, satting 99% on
NRB. US showed PTX on left side per ED report without evidence
of tension pneumothorax. A portable CXR showed collapse of the
left lung with tracheal deviation toward side of collapse. While
in the ER,had acute SOB/Tachypnea with drop in sats with NRB on
to 70's% which spontaneously returned to 100%. Labs were within
normal limits, except for a bicarbonate of 20. Patient's IP
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was conatacted in the ED and made aware of
the patient's admission.
Plan was for ICU admission with bronchoscopy/stenting of the
left mainstem later on this afternoon.
On arrival to the MICU, Pt. was sedated with propofol,
intubated, his VS were HR: 94, BP: 113/69, O2sat: 100% on
100FiO2 and vetilated, RR: 18 on the vent. Vent settings were
TV: 600cc, RR: 18, PEEP: 5, FiO2: 96%.

Review of systems: Unable to assess given sedation and
intubation.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

CXR [**2101-7-11**] - Pre-operative
IMPRESSION:  Near complete collapse of the left lung with
leftward mediastinal
shift. CT may be obtained to assess further for cause of lung
collapse.

CXR [**2101-7-11**] - Post-operative 1.  ET tube 7.5 cm from the
carina.
2.  Marked improvement of the aeration of the left lung with
possible small
left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
CXR [**2101-7-12**]- ET tube is 8.2 cm above the carina.  A left
mainstem bronchus stent
is in place.  Since the prior radiograph, there is no
significant change.
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged The right lung is
clear.  There is no
focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are
intact.
CXR [**2101-7-13**]-FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is
obtained.  Endotracheal tube is no longer visualized.
Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Right lung remains
clear.  Small left pleural effusion is again noted. Left lung is
better
aerated.  No pneumothorax.
CT chest [**2101-7-14**]-IMPRESSION: 1.  Unremarkable position of the
new stent in the left main bronchus.  2.  Post-radiation
changes, stable.  Mediastinal lymphoid tissue, unchanged.
Thickening of the trachea, unchanged 3.  Interval decrease in
the size of the right lower lobe nodule, currently
cavitated.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo male with non-small cell lung cancer with known left main
stem bronchus tumor burden presenting with acute worsening SOB.

#Left main bronchial obstruction/hypoxia/h/o NSCLC: The patient
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath and hypoxia.  He was
subsequently found to have near total collapse of his left lung
with mediastinal shift towards the collapsed lung on chest
X-ray.  The patient has a  known tumor in left mainstem region.
He has had 3 previous bronchial stents for left main bronchial
obstruction and hypoxia . He was intubated on admission and
admitted to the MICU.  He underwent bronchoscopy by
interventional pulmonary who placed a metal stent in his left
mainstem bronchus.  A repeat chest xray immediately following
the procedure showed reinflation of the upper lobe but
persistant collapse in the lower lobe. He was extubated on post
operative day one without respiratory distress, satting well on
50% face tent mask.  He was transferred to the general medical
floors on hospital day 2.  His supplemental O2 was weaned and he
was ultimately satting well on room air at  discharge. The
patient was noted to have desaturations into the 80s on
ambulatory pulse ox, but remained asymptomatic with no shortness
of breath during these episodes. Final CXR prior to discharge
showed  better aeration of the left lung. Per interventional
pulmonary he will need to have an official 6 min walk test and
be evaluated for pulmonary rehab when he returns home to
[**State 5111**].  He will have outpatient pulmonary follow up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 90949**] of [**Last Name (LF) 11084**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] on [**2101-7-26**].
