Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion / Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 87 yo male with history of CAD,A fib, dCHF (EF
55%), pHTN, PAD who presented to the ED from his nursing home
with altered mental status and hypoxia. The patient was admitted
to the ICU for hypotension and hypoxia in [**12-26**] in the setting
of an aspiration pneumonia. For the last 7d, the patient by
report had tremors. Additionally, he was having an element of
increasing confusion, with visual hallucination and
disorientation. He had been treated with levofloxacin for the
last 4 days for a pneumonia seen on CXR and his lasix was
increased from 40mg to 60mg daily. It is unclear the exact order
of what component of these symptoms began after starting the
levofloxacin. The patinet has been afrebrile. On the morning of
presentation, he was having increased confusion, and was noted
bo the hypoxic. He was sent to the ED for further evaluation.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patients temperatue was 98.3, 82,
109/36, and 96% on 4L. He had some degree of hypotension in the
ED, with systolics in the high 80s. He was given a dose of
CTX/Vanc and 2L of NS. His blood pressures improved to the 100s,
and he was admitted to the MICU for further manegement.

LENIs:  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the lower
extremities bilaterally on PRELIMINARY READ.

CXR:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Again noted are extensive pleural
calcifications. The heart is normal in size. Bilateral
pericardial hazy opacities likely represent epicardial fat pads.
Low lung volumes slightly limit evaluation.
No focal consolidation is present. A paratracheal curvilinear
density on the right is of uncertain etiology. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lower thoracic and upper
lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
process.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Transient Hypotension: Resolved on arrival to the floor. The
patient had one episode of hypotension in the ED with systolic
pressures of 80. The patient received 2L NS with resolution of
the hypotension. Given his mild acute renal failure, likely this
is related to hypovolemia. Dry mucous membranes on exam
consistent with volume depleation. No clinical evidence of
pneumonia by symptoms, CXR, or [**Last Name (LF) 108201**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] low suspicison
of septic etiology.  Systolic blood pressures remained above 100
throughout his hospitalizaiton.
.
#. Hypoxia: Unclear etiology. No clinical evidence of pneumonia.
CXR without consolidation, no symptoms of cough or fevers, and
no leukocytosis. Patient does have a history of dCHF, but no
pulmonary edema on CXR, flat JVP, and dry MM. CXR does show
pleural plaques, low O2 sats may be the product of chronic lung
disease versus effects of scilent aspiration.  Patient satting
between 89% and 94% on RA at time of discharge.  He should
follow up with a pulmonologist and get an outpatient chest
CT/PFTs.
.
# Aletered Mental Status: Unclear etiology, but resolved during
hospitalization. No evidence of infection, with out pneumonia on
CXR, no fevers/chills, negative UA. Patient with ARF, so may be
secondary to uremia. Also takes oxycodone, so influence of
narcotics also may be at play, in addition to newly started
levofloxacin. No focal neurologic deficits, and no history of
fall, so did not get a head CT.  With holding of meds and
addressing ARF, symptoms resolved.
.
# Positive urine culture:  Pseudomonas on urine culture, which
has been present in the past.  No evidence of UTI based off UA,
and this was believed to be colonization in the setting of a
chronic indwelling foley.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely prerenal given volume
depletion and hypotension. Improved to baseline with IVFs.
.
#. PAD: Recent stent placement to SFA on right to treat
non-healing ulcer in [**12-26**]. Still with slowly healing ulcer, and
recent follow up w/ vascular surgery.  Persued wound care and
continued aspirin and plavix.
.
#. CAD: No acute process, trop mildly elevated likely secondary
to acute on chronic renal failure. Continued aspirin and plavix
as above. The patient has a history of bradycardia, which is
likely why he is not maintained on a beta blocker. No ACS on
EKG.
.
#. Diastolic CHF: Preserved EF on recent echo in [**11-26**]. It
appears the patient's ACE-I has been held since [**Month (only) **] because of
falls and low blood pressures. Will hold lasix in the setting of
acute renal failure. Monitor for signs of volume overload.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm. Not on rate
control secondary to bradycardia, not on coumadin secondary to
falls.
.
#. History of prostate cancer/bladder cancer/uretheral
stricture. Patient w/ indwelling foley.
.
#. Spinal Stenosis: Continued gabapentin with a dose reduction
and held oxycodone.  Patients pain well controlled at discharge.

.
#. Depression: Continude citalopram
