HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
female who presents with an acute episode of shortness of
breath to the [**Hospital6 256**].  She has
a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes
mellitus,   obstructive sleep apnea and question restrictive
lung disease.  She was in her usual state of health until the
day of admission when, while walking at [**Company 39532**], she became
acutely short of breath.  Over the next 30 minutes, the
dyspnea became worse and she became diaphoretic.  She did not
have any chest pain.  She was transferred by EMS to [**Hospital3 11531**] where she was found to be in pulmonary edema, had
small ST elevations in V1 and also became hypotense.  She was
intubated, given nitroglycerin, started on a dobutamine drip
and then brought to the [**Hospital6 256**]
for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Question restrictive lung disease
3.  Sleep apnea
4.  Type II diabetes mellitus

MEDICATIONS BEFORE ADMISSION:
1.  Metformin 850 mg tid
2.  NPH insulin 85 in the morning, 35 in the evening
3.  Aspirin 325 mg qd
4.  Lisinopril 5 mg qd
5.  Atenolol 100 mg qd
6.  Lasix 40 mg qd
7.  Theophylline 300 mg [**Hospital1 **]
8.  Beclomethasone inhaler
9.  Dexamethasone 1 mg qd

ALLERGIES:  SEAFOOD - SHE HAD A SEVERE REACTION REQUIRING
HOSPITALIZATION.

FAMILY HISTORY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Both parents died when she
was very young.  She is an ex-smoker, ex-alcoholic.  Does not
work.  She is on disability.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  Cardiac:  She had three issues - rhythm, pump and
coronary artery disease.  In terms of her rhythm, the patient
was shocked twice in the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency
Department because of concern for a flutter versus sinus
tachycardia.  There was no response.  She was transferred to
the CCU where she was taken off the dopamine drip, but she
remained tachycardic.  She was eventually felt to be in sinus
tachycardia secondary to pneumonia.  Pulmonary embolus was
ruled out by CT angiogram.  Lopressor was started and her
rate became under control and Lopressor was eventually
increased to 75 tid.

In terms of her pump, a chest x-ray initially revealed
bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.  A
bedside echocardiogram showed no LV dysfunction.  She was
felt to have diastolic dysfunction, which in the context of
her sinus tachycardia put her into failure.  While in the
CCU, she was aggressively diuresed.  Diltiazem was started,
but then it was discontinued because it had no effect on her
rate.

In term of her coronary artery disease, she has no past
medical history significant for coronary artery disease, but
risk factors are present.  An ACE inhibitor was started, but
it was also discontinued in the CCU secondary to hypotension.

2.  Pulmonary:  Pneumonia:  On admission, she had a white
blood count of 28.  On hospital day 2, she was found to have
sputum and blood cultures that were growing gram positive
cocci in pairs.  She was started on ceftriaxone and Levaquin
and the ceftriaxone was eventually discontinued.

Ventilation:  She was intubate in the Emergency Department
and when admitted to the CCU, was on 100% inspired oxygen
ventilator settings.  She was aggressively diuresed given
albuterol nebulizers and intravenous steroids and on hospital
day 4, was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
because of failure to wean from the vent.  On hospital day 7,
she was extubated and saturating 93% on 5 liters nasal
cannula.  She is on 3 liters nasal cannula at baseline at
home.

Restrictive lung disease:  This was believed to have been a
contributing factor to her dyspnea.  The history, though, is
unclear.

3.  Infectious disease:  As mentioned previously, the
pneumonia on hospital day 2, the sputum culture grew strep.
She was started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  The
ceftriaxone was discontinued.  Over time, her white blood
count gradually decreased from 28 to 11.9 and she became
afebrile.  Blood cultures from [**2138-8-3**] grew alpha
streptococci and gamma hemolytic strep.  These were felt to
be a contaminant.  On [**8-7**], blood cultures were drawn
and these were shown to be negative.

Urinary tract infection:  A urine culture from [**8-11**]
was negative.

4.  Endocrine:  Diabetes:  She was placed on a regular
insulin sliding scale and once she started taking po's, was
put on standing NPH insulin orders.

Hypercalcemia:  Calcium was noted to be persistently greater
than 10 towards the end of her hospital stay.  [**Name (NI) 32883**] PTH
level was drawn and her hypercalcemia will be worked up as an
outpatient.

5.  Gastrointestinal/FEN:  She went from NPO to tube feeds to
eating solid foods on [**2138-8-11**].  She did develop
diarrhea while in the Intensive Care Unit.  Clostridium
difficile antigen was negative.  The diarrhea eventually
improved.

When she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
medicine service on [**2138-8-11**] which was hospital day
9, vital signs were the following:  Temperature 98.6??????, blood
pressure 128/80, pulse 96, respirations 20 and saturating 96%
on 3 liters.  She was sitting comfortably.  Pupils were
equal, round and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  The lungs were clear to auscultation.  On cardiac
examination, regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  The abdomen was soft and there was trace
edema in the extremities.

The patient had a stress test in [**Month (only) 216**].  It was a Persantine
MIBI.  There were no anginal type symptoms with no ischemic
electrocardiogram changes.  There was also no evidence of
myocardial perfusion defects.  The ejection fraction was
approximately 55%.  There were no wall motion abnormalities
and a prominent right ventricle was noted.  On [**8-13**],
the day after her stress, the patient was deemed fit to
return home.  She had had a physical therapy evaluation that
felt that she would be fine to go home on this day.

The patient had a [**Month (only) **] PTH done which is still pending to
work up her hypercalcemia.  The patient also had a urine
cortisol done because of concern for a slightly cushingoid
appearance.  The patient is to follow up with these results
with her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was discharged
home in good condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pulmonary edema likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction
in the setting of a sinus tachycardia secondary to pneumonia
2.  Hypertension
3.  Sleep apnea
4.  Diabetes
5.  Restrictive lung disease

On discharge, the patient was to continue her previous
medications from before her hospital admission.  She was also
given a prescription for Combivent, for albuterol and she was
also given a prescription for levofloxacin 500 mg qd to
finish a 10 day course of treatment for her pneumonia.  She
was admitted on [**2138-8-3**] and discharged on [**2138-8-13**].
