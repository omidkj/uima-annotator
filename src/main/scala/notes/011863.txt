Relevant Imaging:
1)CT scan abdomen/pelvis ([**2185-8-4**]): 1. Multiple dilated bowel
loops for which a small-bowel obstruction should be considered.
Although there is a small amount of fluid within small bowel
containing anterior abdominal wall hernia, transition point
likely lies in the
mid anterior abdomen. 2.  Large hiatal hernia. 3.  Marked
degenerative osteoarthritis and osteoporosis with compression
deformities of L1, L2, and L3.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2185-8-7**] 5:57 PM
No active pulmonary changes other than very small amount of left
lower lobe atelectasis.

ECG: ([**2185-8-4**])
Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. Low
limb lead
voltage. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the prior
tracing
of [**2183-8-3**] atrial fibrillation has appeared.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 8370**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with CAD, DM, and CHF who
presents with coffee ground emesis and possible SBO on CT scan.
.
MICU Course
-------------
Patient transfused and stabilized, transferred to floors. Please
see below for details.

General Wards Course
1)Coffee ground emesis: Suspected to have come from upper
gastrointestinal source though this could not be confirmed. GI
was involved in case and helped in management. Patient was given
2 units of packed red blood cells and [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was
placed without any bloody fluids retrieved. She remained
hemodynamically stable with systolic blood pressures greater
than 100 and had GUAIAC negative stools in the floors. We held
aspirin as patient may have had gastric erosion causing bleeding
and platelet inhibition was inappropriate in setting of acute
bleeding. Will defer decision to re-start aspiring to outpatient
team.

2) Partial small bowel obstruction: Patient initially presented
with subjective complaint of nausea and abdominal pain. CT Scan
revealed dilated small bowel loops with air-fluid levels.
Patient decompressed well with nasogastric tube and began
passing both stool and gas without difficulty. No further
characterization of partial obstruction was performed as
symptoms resolved.

3)Coronary heart disease/ Congestive heart failure: Patient had
no chest pain during hospitalization and no changes were seen on
ECG. Aspirin and anti-hypertensive were held for bleeding and
resultant hypotension. Patient is discharged on Atenolol only as
she is no longer requiring any other antihypertensives.

4)Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient presented with creatinine
above her baseline, most likely secondary to pre-renal azotemia.
She was fluid replete and responded well with creatinine at time
of discharge of 1.2 and normal electrolytes.

5)Diabetes: Because patient was at NPO status during
hospitalization, we stopped oral antihyperglycemics and placed
her on an insulin sliding scale. Because she is being discharged
with a modified diet (see below) we will continue sliding scale
insulin until she resumes habitual eating. Defer further
management to outpatient team.

6)Dysphagia: Patient found to have significant difficulty
protecting her airway with witnessed chocking event. Speech and
swallow team was consulted and their impression is that there is
moderate dysphagia that can be reasonably managed with honey
thickened fluids and soft solids. Patient is being discharged
with these restrictions and speech pathology will continue to
assess patient at rehab facility.

7)Atrial fibrillation: Incidentally found on ECG during
admission, because of active bleeding patient is not a candidate
for anticoagulation at this point. Will defer further management
to primary care team.

8)FEN: Discharged on honey thickened liquids and soft solids,
please crush all pills and give with puree.

9)Prophylaxis: Patient placed on PPI

10)Communication: Contact person was her daughter throughout
admission.

11)Code: Patient remained full code throughout admission, status
confirmed with patient upon arrival to floor.
