~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2132-4-6**] 12:44 AM

Endotracheal tube is 4 cm above carina. No pneumothorax. Apart
from mild atelectasis at the left base, the lungs are clear.
~~~~~~~~~
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2132-4-7**] 3:02 AM

There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube.
Cardiac and mediastinal borders appear unchanged. Pulmonary
vascularity appears within normal limits. New small left pleural
effusion is seen. There are new linear opacities in the left
midlung and base consistent with atelectasis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2132-4-7**] 3:45 PM

IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3) Enlarged left axillary lymphadenopathy, suspicious for
metastatic disease given the underlying cancer history.
4) Pneumoperitoneum, presumably secondary to recent surgery.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2132-4-9**] 8:35 AM

IMPRESSION: Slightly improving bibasilar linear atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the operating room on [**2132-4-5**] for [**Month (only) **] of her
rectal carcinoma. Procedure was uncomplicated with an EBL of
500cc. Pain was controlled with a high epidural. Approximatley 2
hours postoperatively, she received a lidocaine blolus through
her epidural. She became hypotensive, bradycardic, and
unresponsive. She was given glycopyrrolate, narcan, ephedrine,
IVF's, and a levophed infusion. Per anesthesia team the event
likely represented a sympathectomy from a high epidural. The
epidural was shut off at that time. After being normalized with
supportive measures, her pain was managed in the PACU with a
dilaudid PCA. She continued to have a respiratory acidosis after
receiving IV dilaudid and was re-intubated. Her blood gases
subsequently improved. In the morning of POD#1, her ventilator
was weaned and she was started on toradol for pain control. She
was transfered to the floor in the evening. Overnight on POD#1,
she was short of breath and disoriented and reportedly
bradycardic. She improved overnight and was stable in the
morning. Cardiology was consulted and was unable to find
evidence of cardiac issues or documented bradycardia on the
telemetry monitor - leads were off / artifactual during episode.
 Later in the morning on POD#2 she was noted to desaturate into
the 80s on her nasal cannula oxygen.  She improved with
nebulizer treatments and face mask oxygen.  Her blood pressure
and heart rate were normal and EKG without changes.  A CTA was
performed to rule out a pulmonary embolus and was negative for
PE but showed atelectasis.  She was observed on continuous
oxygen monitoring overnight in the SICU and remained stable with
SaO2s of 99-100%.  She was encouraged to use incentive
spirometry and increasing activity was encourage.  Physical
therapy was consulted and continued to follow the patient
through her hospital stay.  The rest of her post-op course
remained uneventful and she remained stable off of oxygen or on
small amounts of nasal cannula.  Her diet was advanced as the
stoma began to have flatus and output.  She was tolerating oral
pain medications and out of bed with assistance.  She was
transferred to rehab for further physical therapy on POD6 in
good condition.

Of note FSBGs were elevated in the high 100s during this
hospital admission.  She should follow-up with her primary care
for further work-up.
