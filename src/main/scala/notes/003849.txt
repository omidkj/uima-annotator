CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-8-26**] 10:58 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: s/p fall

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p fall
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

There is mild left parietal scalp subgaleal soft tissue
swelling, presuambly post-traumatic in origin. INDICATION:
57-year-old man, status post fall.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is intraparenchymal
hemorrhage and surrounding edema within the anterior left
frontal lobe, consistent with a hemorrhagic contusion, averaging
3cm in diamter. There is a small mixed density subdrual hematoma
anterior to the right frontal pole. There is a question of a
tiny amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in a few left parietal
vertex convexity sulci.

The remainder of the brain parenchyma is within normal limits.
The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally
midline structures. The fourth ventricle and foramen magnum are
of normal configuration. No definite fracture is seen. The
ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinus are well aerated. There is
minimal mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses. There
are probable moderate amounts of secretions in the nasoharynx,
with the patient being intubated.

The remaining osseous structures are normal. No definite
fracture is seen.

IMPRESSION: Hemorrhagic contusion within the anterior left
frontal lobe, and a small right subdural hematoma anterior to
the right frontal lobe.

MR CERVICAL SPINE

Reason: r/o cord compression, please image to T2 level

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with left sided weakness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o cord compression, please image to T2 level
INDICATION: 57-year-old with left-sided weakness.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were
obtained through the cervical spine.

FINDINGS: Cervical spine is normal in alignment and marrow
signal. The cord has normal intrinsic signal.

At C3-4, there is a posterior osteophyte. This is slightly
eccentric to the left causing mild left neural foraminal
narrowing.

At C4-5, there is a small posterior osteophyte with no evidence
of significant neural impingement.

At C5-6, there is a small posterior osteophyte. There is
moderate-to-severe left neural foraminal narrowing due to
uncovertebral degenerative changes. There is moderate right
neural foraminal narrowing due to the osteophyte.

At C6-7, there is a posterior osteophyte with bilateral
uncovertebral degenerative changes. There is mild bilateral
neural foraminal narrowing.

The remainder of the levels is normal. The spine is visualized
in both sagittal and axial planes through the T2-3 disc space.

IMPRESSION: Minimal degenerative changes as above.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ?acute change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man again with fever
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?acute change
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW, ON [**8-31**]

HISTORY: Fever.

REFERENCE EXAM: [**8-28**].

There has been interval progression of bilateral mid lung
infiltrates with patchy alveolar infiltrate seen in the right
mid lung, left mid lung, and left lower lobe. The heart size is
slightly increased compared to the prior study. There is no
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Increased bilateral infiltrates.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Neurosurgery was
initially consulted because of his head injuries. Once
stabilized in the emergency department he was taken to the
Trauma ICU. He did receive Dilantin and Mannitol at the hospital
where he was transferred from; the Dilantin was continued
throughout his hospital stay. Serial head CT scans were followed
closely.

Neurology was later consulted because of left upper extremity
weakness. He will follow up with Neurology after discharge for
an outpatient EMG. It is also being recommended that he continue
with his Dilantin for at least 4 weeks at which time he will
have follow up with both Neurosurgery and Neurology.

He is being treated for a pneumonia with 10 day course of
Levofloxacin and Dicloxacillin.

Social work was consulted early during his hospital stay for
emotional support; the Center for Violence prevention and
Recovery were also consulted for ongoing care that will be
available to patient post discharge.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted. He is being
recommended for discharge to home with services.
