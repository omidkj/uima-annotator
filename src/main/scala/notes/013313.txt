Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT: 40 yo M with DMI, sCHF EF 40%, h/o MDR recurrent UTIs,
PVD (s/p b/l [**Month/Day/Year 6024**]) with non-healing stump wound infection,
admitted for acute on chronic kidney injury. [**Month/Day/Year **] surgery
peformed a left above knee amputation on [**2114-8-16**].

ACUTE ISSUES:
# left [**Year (4 digits) 6024**] site osteomyelitis vs. myositis: Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] presented
to the ED with a warm and painful left [**Known lastname 6024**] stump, as well as
fever and leukocytosis. Her wound was open with pustular exudate
and granulation tissue. Wound cultures were taken which were
negative for growth. She was started on IV vancomycin and
meropenem and received two days of this prior to surgery.
Infectious disease consult suggested that the wound was the most
likely cause of her infection, given a normal urinalysis, chest
xray, and negative stool c. diff toxin. [**Known lastname **] surgery was
consulted and the decision was made to proceed with an above
knee amputation on the left. Her inability to heal the left [**Known lastname 6024**]
stump was likely related to constant weight bearing. On
[**2114-8-16**] she underwent a left AKA. She was then transferred to
the ICU for post-op monitoring, and then transferred to the
floor for pain management. She was managed with pain control and
dressing changes before discharge.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: on admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] [**Last Name (Titles) 32436**]e had increased to 3.6 (baseline 1.7-2.2) and her
potassium was 7.0. This was assumed to be related to bactrim as
this was a new medication given for her UTIs. The bactrim was
stopped and her creatitine improved. Her potassium was
intermittently above 6, but this was relieved with kayexalate.
There were no changes evident on her ECG. Her lisinopril was
held due to the [**Last Name (un) **].

# Bone culture - culture of a bone sample from her AKA grew
Enterococcus and coag negative staph. A blood cx from [**8-14**] also
had coag negative staph. Pathology of the amputated bone showed
no evidence of osteomyelitis. Treated with IV vancomycin which
she will continue for an additional two weeks. PO vancomycin
also provided for history of C dif.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# pain control - phantom limb pain as well as surgery pain. PCA
pump used while admitted for pain control. Transitioned to PO
pain medications similar to outpatinet regimen. Discharged on
outpatient regimen of MS Contin, Percocet, oxycodone,
gabapentin.
.
# diabetes mellitus type 1 - glucose was difficult to control
while inpatient given her variable PO intake. She was discharged
on an insulin sliding scale similar to her admission.
.
# sCHF - no evidence of heart failure on this admission.
Continued on outpatient medications.

gabapentin 800 mg PO Q8H
