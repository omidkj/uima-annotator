Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 87 year old woman with PMH of DM, HTN, and AFib
s/p PPM admitted to [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2175-8-15**] with non-healing
gangreonous right fourth toe for consult regarding amputation.
Patient was started empirically on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
flagyl until wound culture grew MRSA, and levofloxacin and
metronidazole were D/C'd.
.
The morning prior to admission, at [**Hospital1 **], patient developed SOB
without CP or EKG changes and was diuresed with relief of SOB.
Later in the day, she developed chest tightness and troponins
bumped 1.2/1.26/1.04. The patient was placed on heparin drip
along with plavix and aspirin. TTE showed possible anterior wall
dysmotility. The morning of admission she developed recurrent
left shoulder pain relieved with NTG and morphine and TWI on
EKG. It was decided to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.
.
VS on transfer: 132/68 HR 78 R 18 sat 97% 2Lnc. 0/10 pain. In
the cath lab, patient was noted to have 3 vessel disease.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended CABG on Monday.
Patient was transferred to the floor in good condition,
complains of a mild headache, denies any chest pain or SOB.
.
On review of systems, she complains of chronic nonproductive
cough, decreased sensation in her feet, claudication, and
chronic diarrhea self treated with lometil, and increased
urinary frequency. She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. She denies recent
fever or chills.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PERTINENT STUDIES
# [**8-18**] Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had a 20% distal lesion.
The LAD
had 70% proximal stenosis with a very tortuous mid-distal vessel
with
mid 70 and 60% stenoses. There was moderate stenosis of major
branching
S2 and apical collaterals to the RPDA with retrograde filling of
the
distal RCA upstream of the RPDA. The LCX had a 65% proximal
lesion and
an 80% complex mid-vessel lesion at the bifurcation of the major
OM1.
There was mild-moderate diffuse disease in the AV groove LCX
after Om1
to 50%. Ther ewas a modest caliber LPL1 and LP2, a small PDA and

collaterals to the RPDA. The RCA had a proximal 50% lesion and a
mid
occlusion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mild pulmonary arterial
hypertension,
mild elevation of the LVEDP, no end diastolic gradient. The Peak
to peak
gradient across the aortic valve was 4mmHg (mean of 14mmHg) on
simultaneous recording of the LV and Ao, confirmed on left heart

pullback. The patient had a low calculated cardiac output with
calculated [**Location (un) 109**] 1.2cm2 by [**Last Name (un) 55965**] and 0.9cm2 by Haki, but
dobutamine was
not administered given recent myocardial infarction and history
of
atrial fibrillation.
3. Left Ventriculography was not performed. Heavy mitral annular

calcification and calcification of the aortic knob were noted.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.

# [**8-19**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the distal ventricle and apex. The remaining
segments are hyperdynamic (LVEF = 40-45 %). A left ventricular
thrombus was not seen but cannot be excluded given poor apical
windows. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is an elongated echodense structure in the right
ventricular apex (0.8 x 1.7 cm, clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). This most likely
represents a prominent moderator band and less likely a mural
thrombus given preserved RV function. In addition, a mass
attached to the RV lead cannot be excluded. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with mild aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**]
1.2-1.9 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 7mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDER
