Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
elective admission for coiling of Pcom aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coiling of Pcom aneurysm


History of Present Illness:
From [**3-11**]: 84 yo woman with PMh of LBP, HTn, Gout, Arthirits,
Kidney
stones, Ovarian cyst, dyastolic dysfunction who had an MRI today
showing bilateral PCOM aneurysms.  Says that about 2-3 months
ago
she began to note symptoms of vertical diplopia, right
temporal/facial pain and right eye blurring.  She has had 3 ESRs
within normal limits and was briefly on prophylacitic steroids
for temporal arteritis until the ESR came back negative.  She
was
started on Trileptal 1 week ago for trigeminal neuralgia and
takes 150 [**Hospital1 **] but has not noted any improvement yet.

Her symptoms are mostly constant and have been gradually
worsening.  Her neurologist ordered an MRI/A which showed 12mm
PCOM aneurysm right and 5mm PCOM aneurysm left.

Right eye vision changes complicated by recent corrective laser
surgery on right eye which preceded symptoms.


Past Medical History:
PMHx: LBP, HTn, Gout, Arthirits, Kidney stones, Ovarian cyst,
dyastolic dysfunction



Social History:
Social Hx: [**Last Name (un) **]




Family History:
Family Hx:  no aneurysms



Physical Exam:
Upon discharge:
Neuro: A&Ox3, tongue midline, face symetric, PERRL. Her exam was
notable for LUE weakness and what appeared as neglect to her
LUE.
Lungs: CTA bilaterally.
Cardiac: RRR. S1/S2.
Abd: Soft, NT, BS+
Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
Neuro:
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal
affect.
Orientation: Oriented to person, place, and date.  Attentive.
Language: Speech fluent with good comprehension.
Naming intact. No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.


Pertinent Results:
CT [**4-25**]: Status post coiling of right PCOM aneurysm with no
large territorial infarction. There is a hypodense focus in the
right frontal region which was likely present on the prior MRI
but difficult to compare due to differences in technique. This
can be further assessed on a MRI.

CT [**4-25**] Coils are present in the expected location of the right
PCOM
aneurysm, with extensive streak artifact which limits
evaluation. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, mass, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
structures. A small hypodense focus in the right frontal lobe is
again noted, and is not significantly changed in appearance from
prior study. Periventricular white matter low attenuation, most
likely represents chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The
ventricles and sulci are age appropriate. Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated. Osseous
structures are unremarkable.

[**4-26**] X-ray L elbow:Unremarkable left elbow.

Moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the first CMC joint.
Chondrocalcinosis involving the wrist. It is unclear if a
rounder region of calcification projecting volar to the proximal
carpal row represents marked chondrocalcinosis or the
possibility of an intra-articular or juxta-articular calcified
wrist mass. A gouty tophus could have this appearance, but no
periarticular erosion is identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
85F was admitted to ICU s/p coiling. Neurologically she was
intact however she was found to have LUE weakness and what
appeared as neglect to her LUE. She had a repeat scan which did
show a small hypodensity in the R frontal lobe. This was felt
not to be the underlying cause. She was then transferred to the
floor where she worked with PT and found to be swaying to L
side. She also had extreme L wrist/elbow pain and X-rays were
neg for fx however has h/o gout. She was started on Colchicine
and had relief. She was then discharged home with PT.
