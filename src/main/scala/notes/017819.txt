History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a 84 year-old man w/ Hx of CAD, s/p AAA
repair,vascular dementia, CVA [**2150**], CRI and multiple other
medical problems presented to [**Name (NI) **] from [**Hospital 15303**] Rehab for
evaluation of confusion, R sided weakness and up to two falls in
the last 48 hours, but over 4 falls in the last few days.  Per
son, he has been more confused over the past day, and his speech
has changed with word finding difficulties.  He has been
reportedly coherent and able to make his own decisions up to
couple days ago.  He has had acute changes in mental status
where he has began to forget to do ADLs (eg. forgot to feed
himself).  He was also noted dragging "his right leg and R hand
with decreased strength."
Patient is very off baseline per HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] son, he has had an hx
of prior ? "brain aneurysms" ~ 10yrs ago tx in TX, detailed
history is unknown.

On neuro ROS, reports a headache that is strong, but unchanged
from earlier today.  He denies loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, but ROS appears to be irreproducible.

Per [**Hospital1 100**] home records he has had progressive vascular
dementia,however his son states that he is [**Name (NI) 57933**] and alert, able
to perform basic ADLs independently (w/ exception of bathroom
use) a vast majority of the time.  There are multiple
inconsistencies in hx obtained from son, HCP and records from
[**Hospital1 100**] Home.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2162-8-8**]  3:06:38 PM


Sinus rhythm. Possible left atrial abnormality. Septal Q waves
are
non-diagnostic. There is likely left ventricular hypertrophy
with early
repolarization. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-11-24**]
there is no
significant change.

Reason: AMS, SLIGHT RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS, EVALUATE FOR BLEED



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   84 year old man with AMS and slight right side weakness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   please eval for evidence of bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Wet Read: SBNa SUN [**2162-8-8**] 5:50 PM
large left sided likely acute on chronic subdural hematoma. 7 mm
rightward
shift


Final Report
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST.

COMPARISON: [**2161-11-3**].

HISTORY: Altered mental status, evaluate for bleed.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images of the brain were
obtained. No IV
contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformats were
not performed.

FINDINGS: There is a large left-sided subdural hematoma with
areas of
hyperdensity and hypodensities suggestive of acute on subacute
bleed. This
hematoma measures approximately 3.4 cm in maximal width. There
is rightward shift of normally midline structures by
approximately 7 mm (2, 18). There is adjacent mass effect with
effacement of the left frontal and posterior horns of the
ipsilateral lateral ventricle. There is no intraventricular
hemorrhage or evidence of trapped ventricle identified. The
basilar cisterns are patent. Slight widening of the ipsilateral
prepontine cistern is noted and could represent mild uncal
herniation.

The patient is status post remote right frontal craniotomy.

The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The sulci
are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There is no evidence of
acute fracture.

IMPRESSION: Large acute-on-subacute left subdural hematoma with
shift of
normally midline structures toward the right by approximately 7
mm and slight left uncal herniation.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   please eval for acute cardio-pulm process



Final Report
CHEST SINGLE VIEW

COMPARISON: [**2161-11-25**].

HISTORY: Altered mental status.

FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The aorta is
unfolded and
ectatic with calcifications, similar in appearance when compared
to prior
exam. Calcified nodule within the left mid lung zone is again
identified and unchanged. Clips within the right upper quadrant
are noted. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
pneumothorax. Left basilar atelectasis is noted. Calcification
of the mitral valve is also identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Left basilar atelectasis.

2. Ectatic and unfolded aorta with calcifications, unchanged.
