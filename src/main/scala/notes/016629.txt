Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
51M with uncorrected Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary HTN,
seizures presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with Left arm and leg
weakness. In the ED, he was noted to be satting 70-80% on NRB
which is not far from his baseline sats of 70-80% on 15L at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab. The patient tolerated his tetralogy very well
until roughly 4 years ago when he started to require home
oxygen. Over the past year his condition has worsened to the
point that he gets dyspenic with mild activity and resides at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab where he is connected to 15L O2 at rest. He has
been on Bosentan for pulmonary HTN although he is now on Viagra.

Of note, for the past 2-3 years he has suffered from a
neurologic syndrome of focal weakness that presents fairly
suddenly and resolves over a couple of days. The etiology for
this is unclear but has been associated with a vasogenic edema
picture on head imaging. He was recently admitted for roughly
two weeks to [**Hospital1 2025**] under the neuro service after developing R arm
and R leg weakenss. He underwent treatment initially with
phlebotomy to treat suspected hyperviscosity from polycthemia.
He also had witnessed GTC seizures (which he has a history of)
so he was put on keppra and dilantin. He was treated with
steroids as well. By hospital discharge the weakness was
improving and the pt returned to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on the day of admission, the pt was noted to
have L arm and L leg weakness in addition to L arm
swelling(which increased over a one week period). He was
referred to ED. In the ED, the pt was noted to be satting 70-80%
on NRB which is not far from baseline. He was evaluated in the
ED by cardiology who recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 2025**] where he gets
his care given the complicated nature of his medical story. PNA
and PE were considered as possible acute factors contributing to
the patient's hypoxia and he was admitted to MICU team.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
-Tetralogy of Fallot, unrepaired, with associated pulmonary
hypertension and polycythemia. Previous documentation notes
patient has a right aortic arch, pulmonary atresia, ventricular
septal defect, minimal AR and TR, and many systemic to venous
collaterals. Baseline O2 saturations 65-70%. Baseline Hct 55-60
per pt. Baseline O2 requirement is 12L via NC while asleep and
4L
via NC while awake. Pt gets all of his medical care at [**Hospital1 2025**].

-? complex migraine vs. TIA. Per [**Name (NI) **], pt admitted to
Neurology-Stroke service in [**2-/2110**] when he presented with
transient left-sided hemiparesis and aphasia. MRI/A/V of head
and
neck performed and was normal except for small aneurysm of left
ophthalmic artery and small but patent left vertebral artery.
TTE
showed prominent VSD was overriding aorta with absence of
definite flow across the visible ventricular septal defect. EEG
was also performed and was normal. Diagnosis was ultimately felt
to be either complex migraine vs. TIA. He was started on
topiramate prior to discharge. He presented again in [**10/2110**]
with
transient right sided-hemiparesis. Repeat MRI/A was unchanged.
Diagnosis was again ? complex migraine vs. TIA.

-Febrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures in context of
varicella infection in [**2086**]'s. Was eventually taken off of
dilantin until he had another seizure in the mid [**2096**]'s in the
context of another febrile illness. Has not had a seizure in
over
10 years, but remains on dilantin.

-asthma
-Bilateral cataracts
-Status post cholecystectomy

Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where he remains on 15L O2 at rest. His
brother is HCP.

Family History:
Remarkable for a number of family members with diabetes
mellitus. One brother with CABG x2, another brother with
prostate cancer. Mother deceased in her 40's from brain tumor,
father died three years ago from CVA/ diabetes. Denies history
of blood clots in family

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
51M with uncorrected Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary HTN,
seizures presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with Left arm and leg
weakness.
.
# Weakness: This appears to be a syndrome of recurrent episodes
of focal motor deficits that appear fairly suddenly and then
resolve over a few days and are associated with an imaging
finding of vasogenic edema in the brain. Pt is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 74788**] from [**Hospital1 2025**]. In the past, he has been considered by
physicians for the multiple diagnoses including TIA, reversible
leukoencephalophy, hyperviscosity syndrome, etc. There does not
seem to be a concern for embolic stroke on imaging. pt was
continued on dilantin and keppra. Neurology was consulted here
and pt declined the consult.  Pt was accepted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 74788**]
and will be transferred to [**Hospital1 2025**] today. He was accepted to the
neuro-medicine floor.
.
# Tetrology of Fallot: He is followed at [**Hospital1 2025**]. This is
uncorrected and pt has developed chronic hypoxia, requiring 15L
oxygen at rest and tolerating sats in 70s-80s. There does not
seem to be any other contributors to his hypoxia as he has
returned to baseline--There was no infiltrate on CXR, low
clinical suspicion for PE and risk/benefit likely favors not
pursuing CTA of chest given CRI. Pt was placed on supplemental
02 by NRB. He was continued on his home regimen cardiac
medications, including transitioning to po labetolol. Cardiology
was consulted.
.
# Pulmonary hypertension:  Pt continued on his outpt sildenafil.
.
# LUE superficial venous thrombosis: Seen by US, present on
imaging last week at [**Hospital1 2025**]. Given sthe uperficial location it was
thought that pt was unlikely to benefit from anticoagulation.
.
# CRI: Creatinine at baseline of 1.6. creatinine monitored.
Nephrotoxins avoided, meds renally dosed.
.
# Trop of 0.1: This is possibly [**2-3**] RV st
