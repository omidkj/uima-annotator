bypass.

[**2162-1-19**]  6:17:04 Cardiology Report ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Intraventricular
conduction delay - may
be incomplete left bundle-branch block. Consider left
ventricular hypertrophy
and possible biventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities
with probable
prolonged QTc interval, although is difficult to measure - are
non-specific but
could be due to intraventricular conduction delay, left
ventricular
hypertrophy, drug/electrolyte,metabolic effect or possible
ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2161-7-22**]
the rate is
slower and ST-T wave changes are less prominent


[**2162-1-19**] 12:39 AMCHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of:Stable
cardiomegaly. Small left pleural effusion. No evidence
of pneumonia or CHF.

[**2162-1-22**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM:The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Left ventricular function is depressed EF
20-25%. Septal a nd inferior walls are hypokinetic.There is no
pericardial effusion.
