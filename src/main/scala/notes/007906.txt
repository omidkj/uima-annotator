Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o man admitted for meningeal signs in setting of aseptic
meningitis vs. subarachnoid bleed.  He was admitted to the ICU
under the Neurosurgery service where he underwent extensive
workup for intracranial bleed including Head CT, Head and Neck
MRI w and w/o contrast, Cerebral angiogram, and repeat LP.
Imaging studies showed no evidence of bleed.  Repeat LP
demonstrated xanthocromia and persistent RBC with lyphocytic
pleocytosis.  He initially received Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone 2g,
and acyclovir.  Neurology felt that given his past history of
meningitis, neurosyphilis, TB, lyme, and HSV were possible
agents.  However, his prior episode of meningitis was due to
salmonella in the setting of instrumentation of his spine.  Amp
and Ceftriaxone were discontinued when gram stain and bacterial
cultures were negative. HSV PCR returned positive and it was
felt that the patient had HSV menigoencephalitis given the
presence of blood on LP.  He underwent PICC line placement and
d/c home on a 2 week course of IV acyclovir 800mg q8h.  He
continued to complain of headaches but were improving at the
time of discharge.  It could be argued that the xanthrochromia
was secondary to a traumatic tap on his initial LP and that
encephalitis was not present given the patient's normal mental
status throughout his illness.  However given the serious nature
of HSV encephalitis, a more aggressive course was taken.  He
will follow up with his infectious disease docotr, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1774**] at
[**Hospital1 18**].

His blood pressure was noted to be moderately controlled on his
home regimen.  His ACEi dose was increased and he was sent home
with controlled BPs.  Blood sugars were noted to be elevated as
well and he was started on metphormin 800mg [**Hospital1 **].  He will need
to be followed up by his PCP for management of his hyperglycemia
and hypertension.
