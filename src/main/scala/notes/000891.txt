Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 year-old female with CLL, HTN, CAD, CHF (EF
65% 1/08), hyperlipdemia, hypothyroid, CKD (baseline creatinine
1.3), DM2, anemia, and gout referred in by the oncologist from
[**Hospital1 **] for AMS.  Per record, on arrival to onc clinic she was
obtunded, somnolent, drifting to sleep and snoring with BP
readings in the 90 to 105, which is unusually low for her.
Patient was recently diagnosed with a UTI and started on
macrodantin on [**2-17**] for culture positive UTI.  She also was
started on oxycontin day prior to presentation for tooth pain.
She was also noted to have worsening renal failure with increase
in creatinine from 2 to 2.8, and worsening thrombocytopenia
requiring a bag of platelets.

In the ED patient had a head CT which was negative for
hemorrhage or mass effect and a CXR which was unremarkable.  She
received 1 gram of Vancomycin and 400 mg of IV Cipro, one amp of
D50, and tylenol.

On arrival to the floor, patient is sleeping deeply and awakens,
startled, speaking in Spanish.  She is initially disoriented but
is soon oriented to person, place, date, and time.  She does not
know why she is here other than "[her] doctor wanted [her] to
come."  With prompting from reviewing the record, she says that
she's been feeling tired for a couple days.  Denies any pain,
recent diarrhea or constipation.  Her only complaint is mouth
pain including her tongue and teeth.

Past Medical History:
-CLL: Dx in [**12-16**] by periph blood flow cytometry. CT scan showed
abdominal & cervical LAD, and large right pelvic mass.
Excisional biopsy of left supraclavicular node pathology and
immunohistochemistry c/w CLL. BM Bx [**12-16**] revealed extensive
infiltration, with 40% marrow cellularity. Pt was asympt &
deferred Tx until F/sweats in [**1-17**] & Tx was started
w/fludarabine ([**2164-1-24**]). Rituxan was added to 2nd cycle.
However her chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile
neutropenia. After two cycles of fludarabine this was changed to
single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Rituxan, and she completed four weeks of
consolidation. Her post-chemotherapy course was complicated by
febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia. Her bone marrow was again
assessed in [**8-/2162**] and was consistent with treated CLL. She
remained thrombocytopenic following this without a response to
steroids and only minimal response to IVIG. Rituxan weekly was
given from [**2164-10-10**] through [**2164-11-2**] and platelets recovered
to about 30,000. Bone marrow biopsy on [**10/2164**] suggested a
sustained response to chemotherapy on the megakaryocytes. She
began maintenance Rituxan on [**4-/2165**], but her course was
complicated by diffuse arthralgias. Due to increasing painful
lymphadenopathy and IVC compression seen on CT, she was treated
with chlorambucil from [**2166-2-24**] through [**2166-4-3**]. This was
then stopped due to thrombocytopenia. Chlorambucil was restarted
at 4mg dose on [**2166-8-29**] when she progressed with painful
adenopathy. This was given concurrently with prednisone to treat
ITP. The chlorambucil was discontinued on [**2166-10-2**]. A second
course was again started on [**2166-11-20**].
- HTN with multiple admissions for hypertensive urgency. Most
recent admission with neurological complaints that resolved on
outpatient regimen
- CAD: diffuse multi-vessel disease. LAD stent [**12-17**]
- CHF
- High cholesterol
- Hypothyroid
- Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr about 1.3
- Anemia
- gout
- DM 2

[**2167-2-19**] HEAD CT: FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, hydrocephalus or acute territorial infarct. Since the
previous study, the patient has been extubated. No soft tissue
abnormalities are appreciated. Visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
[**2167-2-19**] CXR (AP PORT): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary
process.
.
[**2167-2-19**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Modest inferolateral ST-T wave changes which are
non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2167-1-27**] there
is no significant diagnostic change.
.
[**2167-2-22**] LUE US: IMPRESSION: PICC line in the left brachial vein
without evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper
extremity.
.
[**2167-2-23**] NECK US: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of internal jugular deep vein thrombosis.
2. No abscess.
3. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes consistent with history of CLL.
.
[**2167-2-23**] CXR (PA & LAT): IMPRESSION:
1. New vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness likely due to
fluid overload or CHF. Coexistent pulmonary infection cannot be
excluded.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**2167-2-23**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2167-3-1**] CXR (PORT): IMPRESSION: Worsening CHF with now moderate
pulmonary edema.
.
[**2167-3-2**] CXR: There has been continued worsening in pulmonary
edema with increased consolidation in the l
