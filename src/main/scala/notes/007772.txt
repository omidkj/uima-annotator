Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath [**8-25**]: 1. Significant coronary artery disease in
LMCA, LAD, and RCA. 2. Depressed left ventricular systolic
function (LVEF = 35%) 3. Mild left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction, mild pulmonary
Echo (TTE) [**8-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed with akinesis of the distal LV
and apex. The mid anterior and antero-septum appear hypokinetic.
The basal LV moves best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent a cardiac cath which
revealed LMCA and 2 vessel disease. Cardiac surgery was then
consulted for surgical intervention. Prior to surgery pt first
needed vein mapping and carotid u/s secondary to pvd hx. As well
as an Echo. Pt. also had renal consult for CRI and [**Last Name (un) **]
consult for better DM management. On [**8-29**], pt was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 3. Pt. tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
Please see op note for surgical details. Pt. was transferred to
CSRU in stable condition being titrated on Epinephrine,
Neosynephrine, and Propofol.
Pt did well in the immediate postop period, anesthesia was
reversed he was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. During
the evening of the operative day the pt was weaned from his Epi
drip, but continued to require Neosynepherine for BP control. On
POD#1 the pt was weaned from Neo drip. On POD#2 his chest tubes
were removed, he was begun on Beta blockade and transferred to
the floor for continued post-op care. By POD#3 the pt had
^BUN/Cr, his diuretics were discontinued, and other meds were
renal dosed. Over the next two days his BUN/Cr returned to
baseline, he diuretics were resumed and gradually increased. It
took several days to see a positive effect from the diuretic
therapy and ultimately Zaroxylin was also added.
During this period the pt had an otherwise uneventful hospital
course. His activity level was advanced with the assisstance of
the PT and nursing staff.
On POD#9 it was decided that the pt was stable and ready for d/c
to rehabilitation for continued postop care and cardiac
rehabilitation.
At time of d/c pt PE is as follows:
Neuro A&O x3, MAE, follows commands, nonfocal exam.
Pulm  BS clear although somewhat diminished at bases
CV    RRR, S1-S2 no Murmur. Sternum stable, incision C&D
Abdm  soft,NT/ND/NABS
Ext   warm, well perfused, 1+edema bilat. Left vein harvest site
with staples-        minimal erythema at staples
