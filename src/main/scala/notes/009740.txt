Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath x 4-6 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to the right
coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 76 year-old female with a past medical history of
diabetes who presented to her PCP's office earlier today with
worsening DOE x 4-6 weeks.  An ECG done at the PCP's office
showed old inferior q waves with new ST elevations in II,III,
aVF.  She was taken to BIDN, where labs at notable for CK 6.2
and trop 0.014 at noon today.  On arrival to the ED there, her
initial vitals were  28-34, o2 sat 95% r/a, bp 151/94, hr 115,
and she was becoming increasingly dyspneic.  She was started on
a heparin and integrillin gtt, given plavix 600 mg, aspirin 325,
metoprolol 5 IV, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent
catheterization.
.
In the cath lab, patient was increasingly tacypneic and was thus
intubated prior to the procedure.  There was a 100% occlusion of
the RCA, and a BMS was placed over this lesion.  She also had a
90% diag, 90% mid LAD, 90% mid Lcx.  Right heart cath notable
for a PCWP 31, PA oressures 54/32.  She was given 40 mg IV Lasix
and transferred to the CCU intubated.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies:
ECHO: [**2147-11-21**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to
extensive apical akinesis, inferior posterior akinesis, and
septal akinesis with focal dyskinesis. The right ventricular
free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Cath [**2147-11-20**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Inferior wall STEMI.
4. Acute occlusion at the level of mid-RCA successfully treated
with a
bare metal Vision stent(3.0 x 12 mm).


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
76 year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes who
presented to her PCP's office with worsening DOE x 4-6 weeks,
found to have ST elevations in inferior leads and now s/p BMS to
mid-RCA, 3-vessel disease on cath.
.
# Acute systolic CHF: A post cath ECHO showed that the patient
had an EF of 15% with apical/septal/poterior AK and focal DK.
Also has 3+ TR and 1+MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 17221**] than being an acute change, her
poor heart function was though to be a more chronic progression
over thelast few months.  This is consistent with the patient's
description of NHYA class [**3-2**] symptoms at home. The patient
initially had crackles on exam, that i
