Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and chest pain for two days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis and chest tube placement
video-assisted thorascopic surgery

History of Present Illness:
68 year-old M with H/O A fibb on Coumadin, COPD, HTN, DM2, and
extensive tobacco Hx who presented to an OSH with progressive
SOB and pleuritic chest pain X 2 days and was found to have a
large left-sided pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
He received Zosyn 4.5mg IV x 1, 2 units of FFP and vitamin k for
a supratherapuetic INR and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED his vitals were T 98.4 HR 120 BP 133/81 RR 24 O2 sat
94%. He had a leukocytosis of 34, left shift with 6 bands, and
INR of 2.5. He received additional FFP & DDAVP and was
transferred to the ICU. Interventional Pulmonology was
consulted, performed a thoracentesis, placed a pigtail drain,
which drained 1.2 L of turbid yellow fluid (procedure stopped
[**1-21**] worsening SOB and pain). The patient's respiratory status
worsened (ABG 7.28/50/96), required NRB, weaned to 60% facemask.
It was thought this could be secondary to re-expansion of a
diseased lung or pulmonary edema. He was started on Vanco and
Zosyn. His UOP dropped and he became HOTN, which resolved with
fluids. Vanc was discontinued. Patient improved and was
transferred to the floor, requiring 4L O2 on NC.
.
Currently, he reports continued shortness of breath and pain
with deep inspiration. He has had an intentional 25 lbs weight
loss over the last 2 months. He has had SOB for over a year,
which he attributed to his smoking history. It is worse on
exertion, would be huffing after one flight of stairs, denies
orthopnyea, PND, or leg swelling. He is followed by a
cardiologist and has had 2 stress tests in the past, results
unknown per patient.
.
He also has chronic back and B/L knee pain. He denies
F/C/sweats, sick contacts, cough, sore throat, abdominal pain,
N/V/D/C, no dysuria, frequency, no HA, numbness or tingling,
seizures, no rash, no lumps or bumps, + easy brusising [**1-21**]

Micro:
[**2138-7-18**] Pleural and tissue cultures from OR No growth
[**2138-7-12**] Blood cultures x 2 no growth
[**2138-7-12**] Urine no growth

CXR:
[**2138-7-24**]: Interval removal of left chest tubes. Persistence of
left
hemidiaphragm elevation along with moderate left pleural
effusion and left
lower lobe atelectasis
[**2138-7-21**]: the left chest tubes
apparently have been placed on waterseal. No evidence of
pneumothorax. The
degree of opacification at the left base appears to have
decreased somewhat.
[**2138-7-16**]: Left-sided pleural effusion and left lower lobe
consolidation
remain unchanged. Opacities throughout the right lung seen on CT
scan are
below the resolution of the plain film. Otherwise, the
cardiomediastinal
silhouette, the hilar silhouette, and pleural surfaces remain
unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.

CCT:
[**2138-7-12**]: 1. Partial drainage of multiloculated left effusion,
with incomplete lung
re-expansion and hydropneumothorax. Cannot exclude some
superimposed
consolidation in partially aerated left lower lobe.
2. New patchy ground glass opacities in right upper and middle
lobes could
reflect infectious or inflammatory process, or subpleural
atelectatic change.
3. Severe calcific atherosclerosis and trace pericardial
effusion.

Renal Ultrasound: [**2138-7-12**] The right kidney is 10.8 cm in
length. The left kidney is 10.9 cm in length. Cortical widths
arem aintained. Echotexturesare within normal limits. No
hydronephrosis, renal stone, or mass lesion identified. A Foley
catheter balloon is identified in an incompletely distended
bladder.
IMPRESSION: Normal echotexture and size of bilateral kidneys
with no
hydronephrosis or stone identified. Foley in bladder.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87427**] is a 68yo M w/hx of afib on Coumadin, DM2, COPD who
presents with respiratory distress found to have a large left
sided pleural effusion.
.
#PLEURAL EFFUSION: His elevated INR was reversed with FFP,
vitamin K, ddAVP and he underwent diagnostic and therapeutic
thoracentesis with pigtail placement by interventional
pulmonology. Initial pleural fluid studies (pH 6.5, low glucose)
suggested a complicated infectious process versus malignancy.
Repeat imaging after effusion drainage did not show an obvious
mass. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and then
transition to Levaquin and completed a 2 week course.  All of
the cultures to date have no growth.

Thoracic Surgery was consulted and he underwent Left
thoracoscopy converted to left thoracotomy, decortication of
lung on [**2138-7-18**]. He was transferred to the SICU intubated and
on pressors.  He weaned off the pressors, successfully extubated
on [**2138-7-22**].  He transfer to the floor in stable condition.

Chest tubes anterior, posterior and basilar were to water-seal.
The posterior was remove on [**2138-7-22**].  The anterior on [**2138-7-23**]
and the basilar on [**2138-7-24**] once the pleural cultures were
negative.

Chest films: serial chest films were done which showed pleural
thickening on the left, elevation of the left  hemidiaphragm and
the appearance of the left basal and right lower lobe
atelectasis.

Respiratory; with aggressive pulmonary toilet, neb, chest PT,
diuresis and ambulation he titrated off oxygen with saturations
of 93%.

.
#ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: His creatinine was 3.5 on
admission with clinical history, exam, and labs (FeNa 0.3)
suggestive of pre-renal etiology. Renal ultrasound did not
demonstrate obstruction or hydronephrosis to suggest post--renal
etiology. Medications were renal dosed and nephrotoxic agents
were held. He was given intravenous fluids and his creatinine
improved.

On [**2138-7-22**] he was volume overload and given IV Lasix with good
response.  He continue on Lasix while hospitalized and
discharged on 40 mg PO.  He had 3+ lower extremity.  ACE wraps
were applied.  His cardiologist was notified and he will follow
his volume st
