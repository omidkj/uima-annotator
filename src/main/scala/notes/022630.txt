Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82M with CAD, chronic diastolic CHF, AFib on coumadin admitted
with dyspnea. Three days ago patient notes that he was not
feeling well. He was more fatigued than usual and had shortness
of breath with walking.  He did not have palpitations, chest
pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, pnd, worse edema than baseline
(has had chronic LE edema X 5 years), syncope, or presyncope. At
about 3 am on the morning of admission he awoke to turn down the
AC because he was chilly. When he sat up he became acutely short
of breath. His wife was able to calm him down and when he lay
back down he felt better. However, over the course of the next
few hours he started to feel more and more short of breath, even
when lying down, and by 7am his wife was very concerned. She
noticed that when she tried to stand him up to walk to the
living room he was very weak and his legs were wobbly. She
called 911, and they brought him to the ED.
.
Upon presentation to the ED initial vitals were: T 98 HR 76 BP
179/68 RR 28 SP02 98%RA. In the ED patient denied CP, fever,
chills, cough, weight gain. His O2 sats declined from 98% on RA
->91% on 4L->96% on NRB. CXR showed mild fluid overload and
possible PNA. Bedside TTE revealed: LA is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2112-4-11**], the findings are similar.
.
He received the following medications: Aspirin 81mg, CeftriaXONE
1g, Azithromycin 500mg, Nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg SLX3 (for HF not
for complaints of CP), and Furosemide 80mg IV X 1. He felt
better after the furosemide (he put out 500mL) and his O2
requirement came down to 94% on 4L. He was transferred to the
floor.
.
On the floor patient remained on NC and then on first set of
vitals was noted to be hypoxic to the mid-80s on 5L NC. He was
placed on a NRB and his O2 sat came up to 100%. He had no
complaints of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or cough at the time. His EKG
was unchanged from prior. A CXR was also unchanged. ABG showed
an elevated A-a gradient with PO2 103 on the NRB. He was given
another 80mg IV lasix, morphine, and started on nitro paste.
Intially he improved with this regimen, however, he would
occasionally dip into the high 80s and then recover
spontaneously on the NRB and they were unable to wean him off
the NRB. He was transferred to the CCU for his continued
requirement of the NRB.
.
On presentation to the ccu the patient was comfortable on a NC.
He denied fevers, chills, palpitations, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, abdominal pain, bloating, worsening
edema, weight gain, diarrhea, and dysuria. He endorsed shortness
of breath as outlined above although currently less than prior,
constipation off and on for several years, and chronic edema of
his lower extremities for the last 5 years - treated with lasix.
