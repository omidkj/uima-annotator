History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with recent diagnosis of esophageal cancer,
gout who presents with fatigue and lightheadedness. Per the
patient and his son-in-law, via [**Name (NI) 8230**] interpreter, the
patient has been hungry but unable to tolerate POs X 3 days.
The patient has tried buns and fluids but generally vomits
everything up (5-6X daily); also endorses some difficulty
swallowing. No coffee grounds or hematemesis. Also no diarrhea,
mostly small formed/firm stools. He does endorse some chronic
left leg pain and intermittent fevers X months; 50 pound weight
loss over the last several weeks. No chest pain, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain, dyuria.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, T98.6, HR81, BP67/48, RR20, 96% on
RA. The patient was triggered and received 4 L IVF and
levofloxacin 750mg IV X1. Because of persistent low blood
pressures, he was broadened to Ceftriaxone 1 gram X1 as well.
His labs were notable for a lactate 3.0, sodium 133 and
creatinine 1.5; his WBC 25.3 with 4% bands and INR 1.4. CXR
suggestive of RML infiltrate and urinalysis with trace leuks, 24
WBC, moderate bacteria (no nitrites). Blood cultures were drawn.

.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is resting comfortably in
bed. He denies current symptoms but requesting the head of his
bed to be lowered.
.
