Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Coronary artery disease


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-4-26**]: Coronary artery bypass grafting x4, with the
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery, and reverse saphenous vein grafts to the second
obtuse marginal artery, and sequential reverse saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery and the posterior
left ventricular branch artery.


History of Present Illness:
53 year old male with reports of chest burning associated with
shortness of breath relieved with rest. This has been ongoing
for the past six months. He completed a Persantine stress test
on [**2120-4-2**]. There were no chest
pain symptoms or ischemic ECG changes with the Persantine
infusion. Imaging revealed a previous large infarct or scar in
the inferior and inferolateral wall extending from the base to
the mid LV with a small amount of peri-infarct ischemia at the
base of the inferolateral wall. There was mild hypokinesis of
the basal inferior wall and the LVEF was 46%. He was referred
for cardiac catheterization. He was found to have coronary
artery disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for
revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram [**2120-4-26**]
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional left ventricular wall motion findings
as shown below; remaining LV segments contract normally.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderate to severe (3+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the eccentric
MR jet, its severity may be underestimated (Coanda effect).
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
PREBYASS. Large (4.9 by 2.1 cm basal inferior aneurysm
consistent with prior inferior MI. The posteromedial papillary
muscle is restrictive and this is the mechanism for the
posteriorly directed MR jet which hugs the wall of the LA
(Coanda effect) and appears to be consistent with moderate to
severe MR with a vena contracta of 5.5cm which potentially
underestimates the degree of MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 16631**] pulm venous flow
reversal. Other valves are essentially normal and no other
segmental wall motion abnormalities. The left atrium and right
atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. LVEF = 40-45%. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
There is no pericardial effusion. Lateral mitral annular tissue
Doppler of 8.5 cm/sec consistent with normal diastolic function.
Mild descending thoracic aortic atherosclerotic plaque. Intact
IAS. No clot in LAA. Normal coronary sinus

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2120-4-26**] where
the patient underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x4, with
the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery, and reverse saphenous vein grafts to the second obtuse
marginal artery, and sequential reverse saphenous vein graft to
the posterior descending artery and the posterior left
ventricular branch artery.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker and statin were initiated.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  POD2 he had an episode of rapid atrial
fibrillation and converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone.  He
remained hemodynamically stable.  His ACE was restarted.
Respiratory he was titrated off oxygen with aggressive pulmonary
toilet and nebs. He was gently diuresed with a normal renal
function and good urine output. He was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics. The patient was discharged home with VNA services in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
