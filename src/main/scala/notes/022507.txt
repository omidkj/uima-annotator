Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2151-11-1**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 2 (left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from the aorta to the first obtuse marginal
coronary artery)
[**2151-10-25**] Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Pt is pleasant 76 yo M w/ hx of CAD, s/p STEMI in [**2130**] w/ stable
LV aneurysm, EF of approx 20% who presented to OSH and was found
to have NSTEMI. Pt was in his usual state of health until he
awoke 2 nights ago with some abdominal discomfort which resolved
on its own. the next AM when he awoke w/ sensation of abdominal
and chest pressure, associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea. The
symptoms did not improve, and the Pt went to the ED in [**State 3914**].
Pt reports that he received an EKG and cardiac enzymes which
were reported to him as "normal".
Prior to being d/c from the hospital, a second set of cardiac
enzymes were drawn and the Pt was told that he was having an
NSTEMI, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. OSH
records show that Pt was given Lasix, digoxin, spironolactone,
carvediolol, Plavix, and Losartan. Initial Troponin I levels
drawn were .01, and a second set was 19.0.

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-10-25**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had a complex 80-90%
proximal stenosis, possibly a recanalized total occlusion. D1
branch had a 70% stenosis at its origin. The LCx had an 80-90%
stenosis at its origin with an 80% stenosis in OM1. The RCA was
totally occluded proximally with left to right collaterals
originating from S1 just before the proximal LAD lesion. 2.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left and right sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 20
mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic
hypertension with a PASP of 48 mmHg. The cardiac index was
preserved at 2.4 L/min/m2.
[**2151-10-25**] Chest CT: 1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary
consolidation, right greater than left, most likely aspiration
pneumonia, alternatively blood aspiration. Extensive bronchial
wall thickening reflects marked bronchial inflammation. In the
setting of severe emphysema, worsened since [**2146**], pulmonary
abnormality is understandably asymmetric and needs to be
followed to exclude a small mass, which could be obscured by the
current abnormality. 2. Large left ventricular aneurysm grown
only slightly since [**2146**]. No pulmonary edema. 3. Tablet in the
distal esophagus.
[**2151-10-27**] LE vein mapping: On the right greater saphenous vein is
patent with diameters of 0.18 -0.33. Left greater saphenous vein
is patent with diameters of 0.17-0.69.

[**10-29**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
infero/inferolateral basal, mid, distal, and apical walls and
hypokinesis of the mid anterior and anteroseptal walls. There is
an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are extensive calcifications and complex (>4 mm)
atheroma in the aortic root, ascending aorta, arch, and
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2151-11-1**] Carotid U/S: 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal
carotid arteries.


Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 634**] was transferred for a
acute myocardial infarction. He was medically managed and then
brought for a cardiac cath on [**10-25**] which revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease. Mr. [**Known lastname 634**] required extensive
work-up prior to bypass surgery which included echo, chest CT,
vein mapping, carotid U/S, pulmonary function test and viability
study. He also required pulmonary and ENT consult for recent
hemoptysis. Since he received Plavix, this was given time to
wash-out while he underwent work-up and was eventually brought
to the operating room on [**11-1**] where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 2. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. For his
chronic systolic heart failure he was placed on coreg.  An
ACE-Inhibitor was not initiated due to his history of angioedema
from lisinopril. He experienced atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response and converted to sinus with amiodarone and
betablockade.  He was started on coumadin for recurrent atrial
fibrillation, which resolved.  His chest tubes and epicardial
wires were removed.  He was seen in consultation by the physical
therapy service.  By post-operative day seven he was cleared for
discharge to home.

Medications on Admission:
At Home: Coreg 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **], inspra 25mg daily, crestor 20mg qhs,
janovia 100m
