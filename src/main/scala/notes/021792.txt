History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 37339**] is a 73 year old man with OSA,
tracheobronchomalacia, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart
failure, and a tracheostomy. He was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-6**] following an admission for a plugged trach. He was
discharged with plans to increase the humidification of his home
ventilator to prevent thickened secretions. While at home, he
had increasing dyspnea, similar to his previous admission. He
said it was worse when he was walking around. He says it feels
like his trach is clogged. He is making sputum and can cough
some of it out through his mouth, but none through the trach. He
has tried to use some of the wash and suction but hasn't been
getting anything out. He feels better when he is sitting
forward. No chest pain, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting. He does not have a trach mask humidifier at home yet.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.2 HR 91 BP 158/72 RR 24.
Reportedly, he was able to speak in full sentences at
presentation. He had wheezes bilaterally on exam. He was given
nebulizers, azithromycin, and 125 mg IV methylprednisolone.
After this treatment, he started feeling better. He was admitted
to the ICU because he uses a ventilator at night.
.
On arrival to the floor, he is feeling slightly better but still
breathing very heavily with audible upper airway sounds through
the trach. Upon inspection, his inner canula was missing and the
suction probe could not be passed. His trach was completely
occluded. At the bedside, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] changed the 6 portex to a
new 6 portex. He felt better after the change.
