not been able to eat over this time period [**3-9**] pain and has had
mild N/V, most recently during the contrast administration in
the ED. The pain is constant and stabbing in nature w/out
exacerbating or relieving factors although he does avoid certain
foods as the tend to lead to more obstructive symptoms. He has

In the ED, he was noted to be AF and hemodynamically stable. He
was satting well on RA. A central line was placed given that
other IV access could not be established. His labs were
completely normal as was his CT scan but he received a total of
~17mg of dilaudid for pain control prior to being admitted for
further work-up.
.
On the floor, he appeared comfortable but complained of severe
pain in his abdomen. He denied any CP, SOB, current N/V,
diarrhea, fever, rash, weakness, numbness, dysuria, or HA. He
has not emptied his ostomy since 5am yesterday (usually 5-6x

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Abdominal pain: patient w/ past surgical history and reported
multiple previous episodes of partial SBO here w/ abdominal pain
but w/out N/V. No evidence of SBO on imaging. No lab
abnormalities. Passed contrast from earlier.  A partial SBO is
possible, but there are no clinical symptoms/signs to support
this.  Other considerations include mesenteric ischemia, chronic
nerve pain from surgery, inflammatory bowel disease or colitis.
Pt. suggests that he researched this hospital closely and chose
to come to it for revision of his osteomy.  We worried that it
was possible that his current c/o were overstated for the
secondary gain of being admitted for further workup.  Early in
the admission we gave him Dilaudid 6mg q 2 hours for pain
control, which the patient stated did nothing for his pain.  We
consulted the Chronic Pain Service, who saw the patient and
added a number of adjuvant therapies, none of which helped the
pain.  The patient constantly demanded an increase to 8mg IV
Dilaudid push.  When he was transferred to the MICU, he was
titrated up to that value.  Upon return to the floor, he was
angry that the floor nurses could noit give the 8mg Dilaudid IV
push, as protocol stated they had to piggyback it.  He demanded
an increase to 10mg IV dilaudid push, and when told this was
impossible on the floor, he demanded transfer to the MICU for
further therapy.  At this point, our attending and psychiatry
along with the rest of the team had a direct conversation with
the patient, explaining that his behaviour was highly suspicious
for drug seeking, and that we would not accept further aggresive
behaviour.  He agreed to stay with inpatient psych for further
detox.  To facilitate that, with the help of the pain service,
we switched him to PO narcotics and decreased his dose by 10%
each day.
.
2. Lower GI Bleed:  Pt. was without bleeding when he arrived via
the ED.  He did state that he had some clots in his osteomy bag
some days before coming to the hospital.  On the evening of
hospital day one he began bleeding from his osteomy, bright red
blood. This occured just after he left his private bathroom, and
it was noted that he had a pair of scissors in his room,
presumably for his osteomy care.  Pt continued to bleed slowly
overnight, and then quickened in the morning.  He was seen by
GI, who attempted to pack his illeostomy stoma at the bedside,
and then by surgery who attempted to carterize his bleeding also
at the bedside.  Neither of these were succesful, and the
patient became slightly hypotensive and tachycardic.  We gave
2-3L of NS and he was transferred to the MICU where he recieved
on unit of PRBC.  He returned to the floor, and began bleeding
almost immediately, again just after returning from the
bathroom.  Nurse noted him to have a pair of broken, sharp
forceps in his room, which were confisated.  He was watched with
serial Hcts, which stabalized, and he was not tranfused.  He was
placed on a 1:1 sitter in case of self-induced bleeding,
although he did go to the bathroom on his on once more, where he
was caught with a pair of scissors.  GI and Surgery both felt
that his osteomy could use an elective revision, but needed
detox and psych care before they could help.
