Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2137-6-21**]. Extubation [**2137-6-23**].

History of Present Illness:
81 y/o F with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed
by lung (on home O2 3 L with rest 6L with ambulation), severe
pHTN, AFib who presented to OSH on [**6-18**] with worsening SOB x 1
week. Patient is s/p 2 steroid pulses for IPF; the most recent
steroid pulse was tapered off last week. In the ED of the OSH,
she was febrile to 103, tachpneic to the high 30s to 40s, and
tachycardic. The patient underwent a CTA of the chest that
revealed no PE, moderate b/l pleural effusion, ? PNA. She was
placed on 100% NRB mask and transferred to OSH ICU where an ABG
showed pH 7.35, pCO2 of 41, pO2 of 49. She was started on BiPAP,
ABG showed pH 7.46, PC02 30 P02 56 on 70% FiO2. She was also
given 20 mg IV Lasix bolus at this time and high-dose Solumedrol
80 mg IV q8. EKG at OSH also showed ST depression in the lateral
leads, and patient's Troponins bumped from .39 to 7. Heparin
drip was immediately started. By this morning ST depressions in
these were less, but still present. She had an echo earlier
today which showed LVH and an EF of 60%, with RVSP of 69. She
was started on Levofloxacin/Ceftriaxone for presumed PNA. She
was also found to have guiac positive stool and recieved 2 units
of blood earlier this morning (Hct 25.4 to 35.2 post
transfusion). Prior to transfer, patient was stable off BiPAP
with pH 7.44, PCO2 22.5, and PO2 130. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] because she is closely followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6786**].

On arrival to the floor, patient was stable, T 96.8 HR 92 BP
117/52 RR 16 O2 95% 3 L NC. She arrived on a heparin drip and
had no complaints of chest pain or SOB.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 96.8 HR 92 BP 117/52 RR 16 O2 95% 3 L NCGeneral:
Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP 8 cm, no LAD
Lungs: Inspiratory velcro-like Crackles 2/3 up b/l
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, III/VI holosystolic murmur loudest
at RUSB
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema


Pertinent Results:
[**2137-6-21**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-1-4**], the
severity of aortic stenosis has progressed and mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now identifeid. The
severity of mitral regurgitation has also increased.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has moderate aortic stenosis. Based on [**2132**] ACC/AHA
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is
asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-15**]
years.
Based on [**2133**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6692**] was transfered from outside hospital for dyspnea x 1
week.

# Respiratory Failure:
Pt with underlying end stage IPF on home oxygen admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for respiratory distress. Pt developed worsening hypoxic
resipratory distress, hemoptysis, requiring intubation on
[**2137-6-21**]. Pt had sputum cultures, viral cultures, BAL for thorough
workup of pulmonary process. She was put on broad spectrum
antibiotics and steroids. BAL showed alveolar hemorrhage. Pt
gradually improved on pressure support ventilation and was
extubated on [**2137-6-23**] after a successful spontaneous breathing
trial on [**4-17**] and a RISP score 33.  She will need to complete a
14 day course of antibiotics with Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin
(6 days post discharge).  Hemorrhage most likely [**1-15**]
anticoagulation during treatment of NSTEMI (see below).  She was
continued on steroids 60 mg daily, subsequently decreased to 50
mg daily.  She will need to continue prednisone 50 mg daily for
1 week then decrease to 40 mg daily until she follows up with
her outpatient pulmonologist, appointment has been arranged and
is in discharge instructions.

#Atrial Fibrillation: Pt had atrial fibrillation s/p intubation.
She was given diltiazem and digitalis and was rate controlled.
Anticoagulation was discontinued secondary to anemia and
hemoptysis. diltiazem and digitalis were discontinued and
patient was then restarted on metoprolol, titrated to a heart
rate <100 for rate control.

# NSTEMI
Patient had ST depressions in anterior lateral leads and
troponin spike to 7.56, likely NSTEMI. Initially started on
heparin and plavix but subsequently had hemoptysis. Cardiology
was consulted and did not catheterize given patient's
instability and inability to go on anticoagulation due to
hemoptysis and GI bleed. Echo showed moderate LV systolic
dysfunction and worsening AS. Plan was to continue ASA, statins,
hold anticoagulation. Cardiac enzymes trended down.  Restarting
plavix should be assessed as an outpatient.

# Guiac positive stool and anemia. Likely due to heparin
anticoagultion. Tranfused PRBCS for HCT<30.  Hct stable at about
40 on transfer.  Patient may benefit from outpatient
gastroenterolgy evaluation.
