shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
A 61 year old gentleman was seen in the ED with after reporting
he was having lower extremity swelling, dizziness, and falling
down. He feels this was related to an atenolol allergy. In the
ED, his vitals were T 100.8, BP 135/72, HR 45, and 94% on RA. He
was given lasix 20 mg and aspirin in the ED. He additionally
complained of chest pain, dyspnea and diaphoresis though he was
unreliable in the ED. Per there report, he was responsive to
sternal rub and answered limited questions for them. He reports
that he was given a prescription for atenolol at [**Hospital1 2177**] but has a
history of atenolol allergy.
.
In the ED, VS: 100.8 135/72 45 16 94%RA. He received Aspirin
325mg, albuterol, Lasix 20mg PO.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was altered and minimally
responded to strenal rub. He was given narcan with good effect.
He was transiently hypotensive, though became hypertensive
without any intervention. He underwent Head CT which was
negative for bleed. Upon arrival to the MICU, unable to obtain
further history due to patient's altered mental status.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 61 year old male with coronary artery disease
status post myocardial infarction, history of pulmonary embolus
status post inferior vena cava filter not on coumadin due to med
non-compliance, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
history of drug abuse, admitted with dyspnea and altered mental
status.

1. Altered mental status:  The patient presented with altered
mental status upon admission to the floor from the emergency
department.  He was then immediately transferred to the ICU for
further care, as there was concern for an atenolol overdose,
with a heart rate in the 40s.  He has a history of overdosing on
medications while hospitalized.  Narcan was given with good
response, suggestive of a narcotic overdose.  The patient then
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which was managed well
with lasix IV.  Urine tox screen was positive for methadone and
benzodiazepines.  The patient's altered mental status improved
on [**9-2**], and the patient became alert and oriented x 3.  CIWA
scale was started after transfer from the ICU to the floor, and
was discontinued the next day after patient did not score.
Initially, psychotropic meds were held.  As mental status
improved, methadone and benzodiazepine therapy were restarted
with recommendations from the psyciatry consult service.  The
patient tolerated this well, and seroquel and duloxetine were
also restarted.  It was thought that the patient's diminished
mental status upon presentation was secondary to mild renal
insufficiency in the setting of methadone and benzodiazapine
therapy.  The patient was evaluated by psychiatry, given his
history of anti-social personality disorder, depression/anxiety,
and polysubstance abuse in remission.  Psychiatric evaluation
revealed a patient who was not psychotic, and did not have any
active, acute psychiatric issues, and was deemed to have
capacity.  There were no further mental status changes during
the remainder of his hospitalization.

2. Pulmonary Edema:  The patient developed acute shortness of
breath, tachypnea, and wheezing upon arrival to the ICU.  Plain
chest film at this time showed evidence of pulmonary edema and
fluid overload.  It was likely that the patient developed
pulmonary edema, possibly in the setting of hypertension
following Narcan administration.  The patient responded well to
lasix IV.  Patient also experienced brief increased oxygen
requirement on the floor, which again improved with lasix and
bronchodilator/anti-cholinergic therapy.  The patient was
discharged on room air with clear lung sounds and no subjective
shortness of breath.

3. history of pulmonary embolus status post inferior vena cava
filter.  He was initially placed on heparin gtt in the ICU;
however, after a conversation with the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
heparin gtt was stopped and the patient's anticoagulation was
held.  The patient is a poor candidate for Coumadin, given his
persistent noncompliance.  Anti-coagulation was held during his
hospitalization secondary to medical non-compliance, and the
patient was discharged without anti-coagulation.
