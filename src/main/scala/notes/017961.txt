History of Present Illness:
56-year-old female with a history of having a right facial mass
that has been developing over the past five to six years.  The
patient reports the lesion is not painful, but that it has been
growing more recently with changing characteristics in the last
month.  She reports it does not bleed but occasionally oozes
liquid from the lesion.  She also states that her forehead is
asymmetric with decreased ability to raise the forehead on the
right side as compared to the left side.  She recalls about 10
years ago, that she noticed a patch of dry skin in the right
preauricular region that would come and go. About 1 year ago,
she noticed significant growth of the lesion.  It started as
dime-sized and she was able to cover it with a regular-sized
bandaid. Then it grew until it reached the present size of 6 cm
in diameter, with cauliflower surface, slight smell, and
occasional bleeding. Additionally, she began noticing high
anterior right neck lymph node swellings a few months ago.
Unfortunately, she did not seek medical attention in [**State 108**] due
to "lack of health insurance" until [**2141-4-12**] when she met
dermatologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13740**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**] who perfomed a shave biopsy of
the large mass, as well as shave biopsy of a much smaller
asymptomatic lesion on her anterior chest at the base of the V
of her neck.


Past Medical History:
squamous cell carcinoma of the right face
COPD
.
PSH:
hysterctomy
tubal ligation
[**Last Name (un) 3907**] augmentation

past 16 years and has worked as a caregiver for the past 4-1/2
years. She returned to [**State 1727**] to live with her son and seek
treatment.  Currently smokes.  She has a 35-pack-year history.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the Plastic Surgery Service on [**2141-7-14**]
following radical resection of R neck mass and subsequent free
TRAM flap w/ skin and nerve grafting.
.
POD#1 [**2141-7-14**]:
Patient was admitted directly to Trauma ICU (TICU) from the
operating room given lengthy surgery and precariousness of free
flap. Flap head good capillary refill throughout ([**12-28**] sec) with
small area at superior pole demonstrating sluggish refill and
slight duskiness.  Patient with continuous Vioptix monitoring of
free flap. BP dipping to low 70s/40s with HR 100-120. Pt
received multiple fluid boluses (~3.5L NS) and 1 unit albumin
with some response but not sustained. Urine output remained
high. In the setting of low BP, tachycardia, and HCT 19.9 (from
25.9) pt received 2 units of PRBCs with resolution of symptoms
(one in am and one overnight).  She remained intubated on
propofol.
.
POD#2 [**2141-7-15**]
Upper pole of free flap remained dusky with sluggish cap refill,
3-4 seconds.  Pulses remained dopplerable in lower portion of
flap. Donor site for STSG and recipient site continued to look
healthy with good amount of oozing.  Pt continued to require
frequent fluid boluses to maintain HR < 100. BP 80-90/40s.
Tolerating large amount of fluid with large urine output.
Patient maintained on strict 'no roll' precautions given
tenuousness of neck flap. Propofol was weaned and fentanyl
increased to help with possible pain induced tachycardia and
sedative induced hypotension.
.
POD#3 [**2141-7-16**]
Patient remained in TICU.  She was rolled to change bedding and
inspected for pressure ulcers in am with plastics present and
providing axial support of the neck. Pt did not tolerate the
procedure well and sats dropped to high 80s with increased fluid
oozing from around flap site. Vioptix replaced with maximum % in
low 60s (94% sig quality)
.
POD#4 [**2141-7-17**]
Right thigh STSG donor site was open to air and drying out well.
 Right lateral lower extremity sutures s/p sural nerve
harvesting remained dry and intact. Flap with + doppler signal
and vioptix stable.  Patient remained intubated and on 'no roll
precautions.  A multipodus boot was applied to right foot to
elevate heel off of bed and prevent foot drop. Abdominal steri
strips remained dry and intact.  A left brachial PICC line was
placed to maintain long term access.  A Dobhoff tube was placed
so that patient could be started on tube feeds.
.
POD#5 [**2141-7-18**]
Patient remained in TICU and was extubated and tolerated well.
.
POD#6 [**2141-7-19**]
Patient remained in TICU and her neck JP drain was removed for
low output.  She was maintained on the heparin gtt for flap
protection.  The bolster over the central chest STSG site was
removed, site appeared healthy and graft adherent and Xeroform
dressing placed.  An anterior neck hematoma had accumulated and
was aspirated at bedside and iodoform gauze tape placed to wick
wound.
.
POD#7 [**2141-7-20**]
The anterior neck hematoma w
