History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 88M with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and
recurrent left sided pleural effusions. He states that he had a
chest xray done in his rehabd center recently, which showed
recurrent left pleural effusion, and was
taken to the ED for care. At the ED, a thoracentesis was
attempted - he says that this was not not successful, as the
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] "pockets" and blood, and the procedure was
stopped. At this point, the patient says he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation for possible surgical treatment.

The patient states that he was recently hospitalized for feeling
weak. He is unsure if he was diagnosed with any disease process
of illness, though he believes that he may have been diagnosed
with pneumonia. Available records indicated that he had been
started on levaquin and fluconazole, as well as a prednisone
taper. The patient has a L cephalic PICC line in place, that he
says was placed while he was at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital because he
needed blood draws and IV fluids/medications.

Imaging:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2117-4-13**] 1:17 AM:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now a severe
left-sided pleural effusion that occupies more than half of the
left
hemithorax. Subsequent left basal atelectasis and blunting of
the
cardiopulmonary interface. At the left lung bases, the
pre-existing opacities have minimally increased in extent. Newly
appeared is a subtle opacity blunting the costophrenic sinus.
This opacity suggests a parenchymal than a pleural origin. The
right hilus and the right paramediastinal contours are
unremarkable.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2117-4-16**] 4:36 PM:
The left hemithorax is not completely opacified with complete
collapse of the left lung and likely adjacent pleural effusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-4-16**] 5:17 PM:
Compared with earlier the same day, there is considerably
improved aeration in the left upper and mid zones.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-4-22**] 11:06 AM:
1. Completely collapsed stomach, with loop of transverse colon
interposed
between the greater curvature and the anterior abdominal wall.
2. Dense consolidation at the left lung base, incompletely
imaged. Small
right pleural effusion with atelectasis.
3. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4 cm,
and spanning
approximately 5.7 cm craniocaudal.
4. Atrophic kidneys.
5. Marked degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.

G TUBE PLACMENT, ALL INCL. Study Date of [**2117-4-22**] 1:48 PM
Uncomplicated percutaneous placement of a 12 Fr Wills-Ogelsby
G-tube. Feedings may be started through the tube in the morning
of [**4-23**].

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2117-4-27**] 10:14 AM
In comparison with earlier study of this date, the PICC line has
been pulled back to the subclavian vein, just to the right of
the junction
with the superior vena cava.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-4-27**] 4:29 AM:
In comparison with study of [**4-26**], there is little overall
change.
Again there is opacification on the left consistent with pleural
fluid. In
addition, there is substantial volume loss with some shift of
the mediastinum to the left. Some of this apparent shift may be
due to the combination of scoliosis and mild obliquity of the
patient


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted from OSH with recurrent left pleural
effusions s/p thoracentesis showing hemothorax.  GS showed
2+PMNs, no micros, and culture was negative at OSH.  Patient was
given vitamin k for an INR of 6 (on coumadin for afib) in
preparation of surgery.  We continued levoflox which was started
at the OSH for likely CAP. He was cleared by cardiology for
surgery.  Geriatrics c/s also obtained.  Patient underwent left
VATS partial pulmonary decortication with parietal pleurectomy
on [**2117-4-16**].  An old clotted hemothorax was removed and a
fibrinous rind was noted on the visceral and parietal pleura.
Two left chest tubes were placed.  Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 2347**]
operative note for details.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  Post
op CXR showed a complete white out of his left hemithorax c/w
proximal mucous plug.  Patient's vital signs were stable with
good oxygenation.  Patient was emergently reintubated in the
PACU.  S
