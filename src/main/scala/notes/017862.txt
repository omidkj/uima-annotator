Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2195-11-27**], he underwent extended right hepatic lobectomy,lysis
of adhesions and
intraoperative ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma and
Hepatitis C virus. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Operative
findings included extensive intra-abdominal adhesions from his
prior cholecystectomy. He had increased venous collaterals but
not obvious portal hypertension. The liver was large and
cirrhotic with large regenerative nodules. There was a mass
lesion in segment VIII extending and pushing into segment [**Doctor First Name **]
with involvement of the peripheral branches of the middle
hepatic vein but the proximal right hepatic vein was clear.
There were no other lesions in the remainder of the liver
demonstrated by intraoperative ultrasound. Please refer to
operative report for further details.

Initially, he did well, but was also having decreased urine
output. A liver doppler ultrasound was performed showing patent
flow in the left portal vein, left hepatic vein, and left
hepatic  artery. Main portal vein was unable to be visualized
and af luid collection adjacent to the surgical margin was
noted. On POD 3 he was noted to have worsening encephalopathy
and repeat liver doppler ultrasound was done showing new
ascites. There was no flow within the main portal vein, though
apparently forward flow was seen in the left portal vein. As the
findings were concerning for portal vein thrombosis versus slow
flow a CT was obtained showing thrombosis of the left portal
vein and main portal vein, extending to the confluence of the
SMV, portal vein, and splenic vein. The splenic vein was
occluded to approximately its mid segment. The common and left
hepatic arteries were patent. The left hepatic vein appeared
patent. The IVC was patent. Hypoattenuation was noted in segment
V/VIII.

Given these findings, he was taken back to the OR by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy, portal vein thrombectomy.
Due to difficult anatomy, the thrombectomy could not be done,
and an attempt was made by interventional radiology with TPA. He
had a portal venogram suggestive of acute expansile thrombus
within the main portal vein. Narrowing was seen at the junction
of the main and left portal veins. A 5 French catheter was
placed. On [**12-2**], focal contrast extravasation from the right
portal vein stump into the region of the JP drain was seen.
Successful exclusion of the right portal vein stump with
placement of covered stents in the main and left portal vein was
done with no further extravasation, however there was still
persistent thrombus in the main and left portal veins after
mechanical thrombectomy (Angioget). Attempt was made at another
thrombectomy with TPA and on [**12-3**] there was interval
improvement, but still some thrombus in the stent and the main
portal vein.

Heparin drip was initiated and the patient was placed on empiric
Ceftriaxone. Also due to his worsening mental status he was
intubated. He was started on TPN for nutrition support.
Micafungin was started for moderate growth of yeast from a
sputum specimen on [**12-7**].

Platelats dropped as low as 57 on [**12-6**], a HIT panel was sent
which returned as positive. Serotonin release assay was sent and
reported as borderline positive. The heparin was stopped and he
was started on bivalarudin.

WBC was elevated around POD 8 ([**12-5**]), although he remained
afebrile. He was pan-cultured. All cultures remained negative
except PD fluid was positive for VRE.

LFTs were notable for progressive increase of total bilirubin,
worsening jaundice and worsening mental staus consistent with
hepatic failure. Lactulose and Rifaximin were started. He
remained intubated. Overall, liver function continued to worsen
and progressed to hepatorenal syndrome necessitating CVVHD. It
was determined at this time that he should undergo liver
transplant evaluation. He had all serologies and baseline exams
completed. He was listed for liver transplant.

On [**2195-12-25**], a donor liver was available. The patient underwent
Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (brain dead
donor)non- ABO compatible liver transplant. Plasmaphereis was
performed prior to OR. Procedure consisted of piggyback, portal
vein-to- portal vein anastomosis, common bile duct-to-common
bile duct anastomosis with no T-tube, infrarenal iliac artery
conduit to the common hepatic artery of the donor, and portal
vein thrombectomy for portal vein/superior mesenteric
vein/splenic vein thrombosis. This was a  PLease see the
operative report for full surgical detail, however it should be
noted that the patient received 8000 mL of crystalloid, 69 units
of fresh frozen plasma, 79 units of packed red cells, 12 units
of platelets, 12 units of cryo, and took 7 liters of CCVH. He
was left with an open abdomen, was transferrred back to the SICU
intubated.

On [**12-28**] he was brought back to the OR for Abdominal washout,
Tru-Cut biopsy of the
liver, reclosure of Silastic abdominal closure. He was unable to
be closed and then on [**2196-1-2**] he was taken once again to the OR
with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy, drainage of
subphrenic a
