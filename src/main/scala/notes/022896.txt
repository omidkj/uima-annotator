History of Present Illness:
32F with mild to moderate CF with pancreatic insufficiency who
has subsequently developed secondary cirrhosis  with biliary
fibrosis and presents for urgent transplant evaluation.  She was
in usual state of health until [**2181-4-15**] at which time she was
admitted to a hospital in [**Location (un) **] for acute acetaminophen
overdose, which she states was accidental.  The circumstances
around this are unclear, but apparently she was taking tylenol
to treat a fever and additionally took some nyquil.  She was
taken to Rush medical Center in [**Location (un) **] and ultimately was
diagnosed with cirrhosis; notably her hospital course was
complicated by MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia for which she was
treated with IV antibiotics. In [**Location (un) **], she was living with her
girlfriend at the time, and after the magnitude of her illness
became apparent she returned to her parents home for their
assistance with her care.  She was admitted to [**Hospital 40074**]Hospital with fever, RUQ pain and jaundice on [**2181-7-26**],
additionally was found to have abdominal distension.  Workup
demonstrated liver failure with poor synthetic function
including INR of 2.9 and albumin 1.5, additionally she had
thrombocytopenia and hyponatremia.  GI workup was negative for
clostridium difficile and the likely culprit for her abdominal
distension, in addition to the ascites, was felt to be a distal
obstruction syndrome. Reportedly she recieved two units of blood
for a low hematocrit, did not have evidence of active bleeding,
and was discharged on [**2181-8-1**] after a transjugular liver biopsy
demonstrated biliary fibrosis/cirrhosis.  She was readmitted on
[**2181-8-14**] with jaundice/anasarca and underwent diagnostic and
therapeutic paracenteses with 4.5L of thin fluid removed,
negative for SBP.  She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
urgent transplantation evaluation. Since arriving here, her
transplantation evaluation has proceeded expeditiously on the
hepatology service.  Additionally she has been seen by
transplant infectious disease, transplant social work, and
pulmonology.  per records, she has a recommendation from
pulmonology that she be on tobramycin daily and pulmozyme, which
she is not on at this point.  Pulmonology recs from our center
are pending. On initial examination she is resting comfortably
with no immediate complaints.  Based on her current labs she is
Child's C/MELD 38.2.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3175**] was admitted [**2181-8-17**] for liver transplant evaluation.
She was transferred from [**State 792**]with decompensation of her
liver (MELD 38 at this time). No infection was found at first
(BCx, UCx) to incite the worsening of her liver status, but
later, she was treated for Pneumonia in the setting of Cystic
Fibrosis with Vanc and Cefepime after bilateral infiltrates were
seen on CXR. On the floor, her condition deteriorated and her
Acute Kidney Injury worsened, thought to be due to Hepatic Renal
Syndrome (UNa<10). Due to her worsening Cr, she was to undergo
dialysis as a bridge to transplant, and thought not to be able
to maintain pressures during hemodialysis so she had to go to
the ICU to for CVVH. She also was not taking in enough nutrition
and a NG tube was placed and she was transfered to the SICU. At
that time, her MELD was >40.

SICU Course:

[**8-26**]: lactulose titrated down from q2 to q6 after 1800+ stool
output during first part of day, mental status remained clear,
CVVH 100cc/hr, BP stable, repeat blood cx sent [**8-27**]: CVVHDF goal
3000cc/24hrs. octreotide was stopped and creon increased to TID
with meals as she was tolerating regular diet. Hct 22.9,
transfused 2u pRBCs. (+)UA but had already been on cefepime, UCx
sent. [**8-28**]: lactulose back to q4, 2FFP, 1 cryo, bronch w/IP
first attempt not tolerated [**2-15**] nausea, emesis, 2nd attempt at
bronch successful- no purulent material sample from RML, a
little blood; paracentesis w/body fellow. DC cefepime and
started meropenem. Increasing FiO2 requirement overnight,
intubated at 10PM for worsening respiratory status and ABG, and
requiring neo gtt after intubation. 2u PRBCs transfused. 500cc
5% albumin. Likely hemorrhoidal bleed that wasn't stopping so
started giving 2 u FFP and bleeding vessel suture ligated.
Inserted left IJ and floated a swan. Started fluconazole and
tobramycin. 4L negative over course of the day. [**8-29**]: TTE
revealed elevated PA pressures. Bronch preformed and BAL from
RML showed 2+PMN's, no orgs. small left apical pneumothorax
appreciated on CXR but did not appear to be clinically relevant.
Pressor requirement increased, levo/vaso were started given
septic shock secondary to pneumonia, neo was weaned off. [**8-30**]:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3175**] was deactivated on the liver transplant list due to
overall illness secondary to liver failure in setting of
pneumonia and septic shock with pressor requirement. [**8-31**]:
Repeat CXR secondary to asynchrony tachypnea on vent, relatively
unchanged. BAL from [**8-29**] revealed PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA,
ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS BAL [**8-28**] - STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
MALTOPHILIA. 1645, Bloody output noted from NGT, lavage, she was
transfused 1 uPRBCs, 1 u cryo. PO2 69 on FiO2 50%, PEEP 10 inc
to 60% and 12 repeat ABG [**9-1**]: Switched to ambisone from
micafungin for better fungal. Given poor ventilation and
oxygenation she was paralyzed with cisatricurium. In the setting
of hypotension, fluid was unable to be removed with CVVH. [**9-2**]:
pressor requirement markedly increased and neosynephrine was
added. Given MSOF secondary to septic shock in setting of
pneumonia and extremely poor prognosis a family meeting was held
and she was made DNR/DNI. On [**2181-9-3**] the family decided to make
the patient CMO. Pressors were stopped and she was started on
morphine for comfort. She expired shortly thereafter.
