Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension following right hip arthroplasty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right hip arthroplasty

History of Present Illness:
85 year old man admitted to the medical ICU from the
post-operative care unit for persistent hypotension post-op. He
was initially admitted [**2138-1-2**] with avascular
necrosis/osteoarthritis of the right femoral head s/p ORIF
intertrochanteric femur fracture. He underwent conversion of
prior right hip fracture to total hip replacement. Post
opeartively, he was agitated and hypotensive (sbp 90s). In PACU
he received 1.5mg haldol over several hours, and a total of 10mg
IV of morphine for agitation and pain control.


Past Medical History:

[**1-3**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm with a
single. Vertical axis. Right bundle-branch block. Since the
previous tracing of [**2137-12-30**] decreased QRS voltage in leads VI-V2
may be related to lead position

Radiology
[**1-2**] right hip plain films: The distal femoral component of the
THA is excluded from intraoperative frontal film. There has been
placement of a right total hip arthroplasty with a cemented
acetabular and femoral component. On this single AP view,
components are aligned.

[**1-3**] CXR: No pneumonia or CHF. Subtle increased interstitial
markings at the bases are unchanged

[**1-7**] CT Abdomen: Moderate-sized hematoma with residual air
pockets from recent surgery adjacent to right hip prosthesis. No
extension with into the retroperitoneum or more inferiorly into
the thigh. Bilateral small pleural effusions, mild subcutaneous
edema diffusely and some collection of fluid within the
perirectal fat. Findings consistent with mild anasarca.
Stable bilateral adrenal adenomas

[**1-8**] CT Chest: The heart size is normal. Extensive aortic and
coronary calcifications are identified. There is no axillary,
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Evaluation of the lung
parenchyma is somewhat limited by respiratory motion. Again seen
are numerous small pulmonary nodules which are stable back to
[**2134**]. Scattered tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities are also unchanged. There
are moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Visualized portions of
the upper abdomen are stable with fullness of the adrenal glands
again noted. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
Right proximal humeral enchondroma or bone infarct is again
noted.

[**1-13**] KUB/upright: There is no evidence of free intra-abdominal
air. Normal bowel gas [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] seen. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is
identified. There is unchanged appearance of a right prosthetic
hip. High-density material overlying the L5 vertebral body
unchanged and likely represents a prior history of
vertebroplasty.

[**1-13**] CXR: No evidence of pneumonia. Stable small bilateral
pleural effusions.

Pathology
[**1-2**] right hip: The articular surface of the bone appears
focally eburnated with small osteophyte formation of which
representative sections are submitted in A-B. Decalcified.

Transthoracic echochardiogram [**2138-1-7**]: EF 50%. Mid inferior
(and probable inferolateral) hypokinesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen, [**1-28**]+ MR.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old male initially admitted to the medical ICU with
hypotenstion following a right total hip replacement. He was
stabilized and transferred to the general medical floor
[**2138-1-6**]. His hospital course was notable for NSTEMI, right
hip/left groin hematomas, atrial fibrillation, and diarrhea
(likely C. diff).

1) Hypotension: The patient's post-op hypotension was most
likely secondary to NSTEMI (see below) and peri-op blood loss.
His blood pressure stabilized and, at time of discharge, his sbp
was 120s.

2) Coronary artery disease with NSTEMI: The patient's troponin
peaked at 0.27 on [**2138-1-5**]. An echocardiogram was obtained,
which showed an EF 50% (down from pre-op PMIBI 66%) with mid
inferior and probable inferolateral hypokinesis. The cardiology
service was consulted, who recommended medical management. He
was started on high dose statin, continued on beta-blocker
(sotolol), and aspirin. He will follow-up with his cardiologist
as an outpatient.

3) Supraventricular tachycardia: The patients telemetry
monitoring showed a predominantly sinus rhythm with PVCs and
occasional runs of atrial fibrillation/flutter along with rare
4-5 beats of NSVT. His sotalol dose was increased to 80 mg daily
with improved rate control.

4) Mental status change: The cause of the patient's poor mental
status, which was clearing by time of discharge, was likely
multifactorial - delirium due to multiple acute illnesses
(diarrhea, recent surgery/anesthesia, pain) superimposed on his
underlying dementia. The patient was restarted on Namenda and
Donepezil. Vitamin B12, RPR, and TSH were within normal limites.
The patient was very sensitive to narcotics, and, on the evening
of [**2138-1-9**] required multiple doses of Narcan for depressed
mental status. At time of discharge, his pain was controlled on
standing tylenol with tramadol as needed.

5) Right hip and left groin hematomas: These developed while the
patient had a supratherapeutic INR. He required 2 tranfusions of
PRBC (last [**1-10**]), and his INR was reversed with vitamin K and
FFP. His hematocrit remained stable (34.4 on discharge), and he
was restarted on coumadin. His hematocrit will need to be
closely monitored as an outpatient, particularly while he is
anticoagulated.

6) Anemia: This was likely due to peri-operative bleeding as
well as to the hematomas mentioned above. The patient was
transfused 6 units of blood in the immediate post-op period,
followed by 2 units of blood (the last [**1-10**]) when he developed
the above hematomas. Further work-up included iron studies (not
consistent with deficiency, vitamin B12/folate (not deficient),
haptoglobin (not consistent with hemolysis), SPEP/UPEP
(negative), and fibrinogen (not consistent with DIC). His
hematocrit on discharge was stable at 34.4. He will need to have
his hematocrit monitored
