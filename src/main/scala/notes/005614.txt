DIAGNOSIS:
1. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
2. Acute renal failure.
3. Respiratory insufficiency.

OPERATIONS:  Repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
[**2131-9-5**].

SUMMARY:  This 69-year-old man was transported to [**Hospital1 346**] by helicopter.  He had been seen at
another hospital for hypotension and CT scan demonstrated an
8 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The patient arrived in the
operating room at [**Hospital1 69**]
intubated with tachycardia of 110 and a blood pressure of
approximately 100 with intravenous fluids running.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent immediate repair of
the ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He was severely
hypotension throughout the procedure.  The aneurysm involved
the origin of the renal arteries.  Postoperatively, he was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and was there for the
remainder in the stay in the hospital.

Postoperatively, he was started on CVAD and efforts were
made to reduce the volume load.  In addition, he required
intensive pulmonary support with initial PEEP of 20 and over
the next two weeks, constant efforts were made to improve
pulmonary function and remove excess volume.  This was
difficult because at times cardiac function was compromised.
The patient required pressor agents through most of his
hospital stay.

At approximately day 18 of hospitalization, he developed
sepsis and became very difficult to sustain cardiac function.
His family expressed a very strong wish to provide comfort
measures only, and this was instituted on [**2131-9-17**], and the
patient expired on [**2131-9-18**].

A postmortem was obtained that showed the abdominal aortic
graft intact with intact suture lines.  There was a large
retroperitoneal hematoma.  There were pulmonary findings
consistent with diffuse alveolar damage.  The left kidney was
infarcted and there was a perisplenic abscess.
