Chief Complaint:
Left arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bone biopsy--left humerus

History of Present Illness:
82M with h/o prostate CA who p/w increasing pain of left arm.
Sveral months PTA, pt hit his arm.  He went to local ER and was
told he had a mild fracture, treated with sling and pain
control.  however, the pain worsened over the last few months.
Pt came in to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  In [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to
have displaced left humerus fracture, likely pathologic.  ROS of
notable for increased LE edema.

LEFT ARM FILM:
Pathologic fracture of the proximal humerus as described above.
A large lytic lesion is present involving the humeral head and
proximal humerus. This is concerning for metastatic disease.
Taking into account the recent chest x-ray that did not
demonstrate evidence of malignancy, this is concerning for
metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma and abdominal CT is
recommended for further evaluation.

CHEST CT:
1. 2.6 x 2.4 cm left lower lobe lesion, likely lung carcinoma.
This lesion would be amenable to a CT-guided biopsy if
clinically desired.

2. Extensive pleural thickening and calcification likely from
asbestos exposure.

3. Rounded pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe, suspicious
for metastasis.

4. Bony destruction of T9 and T10 vertebrae with tumor extension
into the bony spinal canal. There is a high risk for compression
fracture in the future given the extent of these lesions.

5. Two suspicious enhancing areas within the right lobe of the
liver raise the question of metastases, though the appearance is
not typical.

6. Likely bilateral renal cysts, incompletely characterized.

7. Mild aneurysmal dilatation of the distal aspect of the
abdominal aorta. Left common iliac artery aneurysm. Roughly 50%
stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery. Bilateral
atrial enlargement.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESP:  Initially, pt admitted to floor for workup of
malignancy.  However, on day#1, he developed increasing
agitation.  He was not clearing secretions and was intubated for
airway protection.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Pt was in
ICU for about 6 days.  As his agitation and myoclonuse improved,
he was extubated, and then transferred back to floor.
.
2) HUMERUS FRACTURE:  AS this represented likely pathologic
fracture, a needle biopsy was done.  Pt also had malignancy w/u
with torso CT.  This showed lung masses and abdominal mets.  The
pathology from humerus revealed likely metastatic lung
carcinoma.  Pt was seen by ortho onc but was not a surgical
candidate.
.
3) ONC:  Pt was seen by onc, rad onc, neurosurg, and ortho onc
regarding likely lung CA with mets to bone including spine.
However, based on discussions with family, pt was made CMO given
very poor prognosis.  A few days after this change, on [**9-13**], the
pt was found unresponsive and pronounced dead at 7:15AM.  The
family was called and declined autopsy.
.
4) CV:  His CAD, CHF, afib were not active issues during this
hospitalization.  EP service was consulted to turn off ICD given
pt made CMO, however, this was not completed as there was
concern that the family did not want to tell pt this was to be
done.
