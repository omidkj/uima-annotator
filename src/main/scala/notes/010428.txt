Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
 Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
A 57 year old woman was transferred from [**Hospital6 **] intubated and sedated for PNA, vomiting and altered
mental status. Per the patient's husband, she complained of a
sore throat for the past few days without any other complaints
of dyspnea or chest pain. Her mental status declined last night
to the point where she was unable to take her meds herself and
she developed increased wheezing. It continued to decline into
the morning with minimal responsiveness and so he called EMS. He
measured her blood pressure at 117/70s prior to EMS arrival.
.
She is normally self-sufficient at baseline, walking with a cane
+/- walker, but does have issues with swallowing and frequently
aspirates. The husband has had a cold recently, but denies other
sick contacts for his wife.
.
At NVMC per report & record, she received Ceftriaxone, Levophed
after a failed attempt at Narcan for arousal. OSH Utox
significant for benzos & opiates, consistent with home
medications. She appears to have developed hypotension after
intubation/sedation.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: HR 113 BP 90/68 RR 25.
The patient arrived intubated and sedated with a L subclavian in
place. She was difficult to sedate requiring 400 Fentanyl and 20
of Midazolam. She was started on Levophed to maintain MAP >65
after 4L NS. Levaquin and Flagyl added.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 57 year old woman transferred from NVMC intubated/sedated on
pressors for PNA.  She died on [**2-16**] at 0530 AM.
.
#. Sepsis: Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin were
continued. Oseltamavir was also given empirically.  Pressor
requirements quickly escalated until patient required maximum
doses of norepinephrine, vasopressin, phenylephrine, and finally
epinephrine to maintain MAP >65.  Despite this, acidosis
continued to worsen.  Bicarbonate was given repeatedly. Urine
output fell.  Blood cultures from OSH demonstrated likely strep
pneumo. Given excessive pressor requirement and failure to
improve, the decision was made with the patient's family to
withdraw care.  Her blood pressure fell to 40/20 for several
hours prior to death.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Secondary to pneumonia.  The
patient was intubated for a combination of AMS and hypoxia.
ARDSnet ventilation was provided.  Oxygenation was not a
problem.  She was terminally extubated after pressors were
withdrawn.
.
#. Altered Mental Status: Likely secondary to illness.  Head CT
unremarkable.
.
#. Tachycardia: The patient was tachycardic, likely secondary to
fever and norepinephrine.
.
#. Leukopenia with Bandemia: Likely bone marrow derangement from
sepsis.
.
#. Anemia: Iron studies were pending.
.
#. Renal failure: Likely ATN in the setting of poor perfusion
from sepsis.
.
#. Parkinson's:  Azilect was held, Sinemet continued.
.
#. Depression/Anxiety:  Cymbalta and Xanax were held given AMS.

.
#. Diet controlled Type 2DM:  ISS was given as needed initially.
 As she became more ill, she became progressively more
hypoglycemic, requiring frequent D50 administration.
.
CODE STATUS:  Patient was initially full code.  This was changed
to DNR/DNI when the gravity of her situation was presented to
her family.  As her situation worsened hte made the decision to
transition to comfort measures only.
