History of Present Illness:
78 y/o woman with CAD multiple PCIs (9 stents), CHF with
preserved ejection fraction, mild pulm hypertension, CVA, HTN,
NIDDM, PVD, and microscopic colitis who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
on the night of [**9-26**] with fever, severe dyspnea, wheezing,
malaise, nausea, and one episode of watery diarrhea. On
presentation, she was hypoxemic to 70% on RA. She had crackles
and wheezing on lung exam. CXR showed possible LLL infiltrate,
pulmonary edema. The patient received aspirin, 40mg IV lasix,
and 750mg IV Cipro. Initially, the patient was given metoprolol
and the rest of her home meds including losartan, aspirin,
[**Date Range 4532**], and lipitor were continued. She was placed on BiPap.

was intubated started on lasix gtt, nitro gtt, and heparin gtt.

On arrival to the floor, patient was intubated but awake, able
to answer questions and follow commands, and in no acute
distress. She denied any chest pain or abdominal pain. Vitals on

Blood Culture [**2174-9-28**]: NGTD x 6 days

Images/Studies:
EKG [**2174-9-27**]: Sinus rhythm. Slight ST segment elevation with T
wave inversions in the anterior leads raises concern for
evolving myocardial infarction. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Inferior ST-T wave changes may also be due to
ischemia. Compared to tracing #1 there are now deep T waves seen
in leads V3-V6 raising concern for ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

EKG [**2174-9-28**]: Sinus rhythm. ST segment elevation with T wave
inversions seen in the anterior precordial leads raises concern
for ischemia. Inferior ST-T wave changes also raise some concern
for ischemia. Compared to tracing #2 no interim change.

EKG [**2174-10-1**]:Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Compared to
the previous tracing  of [**2174-9-28**] there is further evolution of
recent or ongoing anterolateral and apical myocardial
infarctions. Clinical correlation is suggested.

EKG [**2174-10-2**]: Sinus rhythm with increase in rate as compared to
the previous tracing  of [**2174-10-1**]. There is further evolution of
acute anterolateral and apical myocardial infarctions. Followup
and clinical correlation are suggested. The Q-T interval remains
prolonged.

CXR [**2174-9-27**]: Endotracheal tube with distal tip in the right
mainstem bronchus. Unchanged bilateral pulmona
