Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
85 yo male, h/o CAD s/p CABG, Hypercholesterolemia, presenign
from OSH with chest pain and EKG changes.  He states that he has
been getting chest pressure intermittently for the past year;
this pain gets worse with exertion, better when he lies down,
and improves after SL NTG.  It is usually associated with some
SOB, but he denies any nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis/palpitations.
 He was scheduled for an outpatient elective catheterization
this week.  On day of admission, however, he was at his
granddaughter's birthday party, when he noticed the gradual
onset of this pain.  It started in his mid/lower chest and
radiated bilaterally to under his armpits.  It was associated
with SOB and was [**10-15**] at its worst.  EMS was called, and he was
given NTG spray en route to [**Hospital6 **].  Initial EKG
at OSH showed 1-[**Street Address(2) 26224**] elevations with 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**]
depressions anterolaterally, and he was started on NTG drip,
given morphine, heparin, and Lopressor.  He was transferred here
for urgent catheterization which revealed severe native disease
with occlusion of SVG-RCA, patent SVG-LAD.  Hct was noted to be
23, and first set of CE's was negative.  No intervention was
performed in the cath lab, and he was transferred to CCU for
blood and further mgt.  He denies any blood in stool but states
he has had a few episodes of hematuria; he has a history of
colon cancer for which he had a partial resection of his colon
many years ago (?when last colonoscopy).

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  CAD: pt was admitted with chest pain with EKG changes (?ST
elevations at OSH, although this ECG was not transferred with
the pt and ECG at [**Hospital1 **] showed ST depressions only). He was taken
to cardiac catheterization, but no intervention was done as the
lesion in the graft appeared to have been chronic. There was a
question if symptoms of chest pain were all in setting of demand
given that the pt's Hct was 23. He was transfused a total of 4
units pRBC's and Hct came up to 34. He was weaned off of the
nitro gtt, and BP was controlled with ACEi. Enzymes peaked with
a CK of 574, troponin of 1.21. After arriving in the CCU he
stated he had no further chest pain and was comfortable. He was
started on plavix and kept on ASA. He was not started on a beta
blocker because his heart rate was in the 50's without this
medication and given his h/o moderate to severe AS, it was felt
this medication might worsen his symptoms. ACEi was titrated up
to Lisinopril 10mg daily to maintain the pt's sBP around 120.

2.  Pump: Echo was performed which showed a nml EF (>55%) but
also moderate to severe AS. The pt was gently diuresed while
receiving the blood products. He maintained excellent
oxygenation and had no edema in his LE's. He was discharged with
the increased dose of lisinopril while his outpatient lasix dose
was kept the same.

3.  Anemia: Hct was 23 on admission, unclear etiology.  Pt has a
history of colon cancer and ?recent GU bleeding. He was not sure
when his last colonoscopy was performed. His Hct remained stable
after the transfusions and stool remained brown but guiac
positive. He should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26225**], his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] may
direct a iron deficiency anemia workup which should likely
include a colonoscopy as well as possible workup for hematuria.

4.  Hypercholesterolemia: Given pt's MI, it was felt that a
higher dose of statin would likely be beneficial. His Zocor was
increased to 40mg daily and should likely be titrated up if his
LFT's remain stable. These should be tested by his PCP and
further [**Name9 (PRE) 26226**] carried out in the outpatient setting.

6.  AD: Pt was continued on aricept, celexa, and memantine. He
was slightly disoriented on first arrival to the CCU, but
improved after he was given his medications.

7.  BPH: He was continued on finasteride. When his foley
catheter was taken out, he had difficulty urinating at first,
but eventually voided spontaneously before he left the hospital.

8.  ?glucose intolerance: Pt's blood sugars were monitored but
his fasting sugars remained below 120 while in house and he did
not require any therapy.

9.  Renal insufficiency: creatinine was 1.5 on admission.
Outside records showed that his recent Cr values were 1.5 to
1.8. The etiology of this CRI is unclear and should be monitored
by his PCP.
