History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 yo M with very complicated hx including diastolic
CHF, probable CAD, s/p pacer for CHB, PE ([**2125**]), htn,
dyslipidemia, tracheal stenosis s/p multiple T-tubes, dilations,
stents, COPD, OSA, h/o pneumothorax, AAA s/p repair and s/p
graft infection, axillary DVT, h/o seizure disorder, adrenal
insufficiency on prednisone, h/o pseudomonas sepsis, h/o ARDS,
h/o MRSA bronchitis, h/o c.diff, GIB, gout, balanitis, reflex
sympathetic dystrophy, and depression who presents today with hx
of multiple falls over the past few weeks and en route for an
outpatient head CT was noted to have decreased BP in the 90s and
slurred speech. He was also noted to have one minute of chest
pain en route to the ED.
.
He states that since his hospitalization in [**Month (only) **] for toe
surgeries, he has noticed that he has not been able to walk and
has been dependent on a walker and wheelchair. Before this
hospitalization, he was able to walk 30 steps. He also has had
multiple leg surgeries and states he has had a right foot drop
for a while. However, 3 weeks ago, he noticed that he has been
falling ore. His first fall 3 weeks ago, he states that his
hands were shaking uncontrollably but not similar to his
previous seizures. He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence
with this. He was lightheaded at the time. He states he was
referred to a neurologist who increased his neurontin dose at
that time. He then had his second fall on [**10-2**] where he noticed
his legs were shaking uncontrollably. He also complained of
lightheadedness at that time and had subsequent blurry/double
vision. At [**Hospital1 18**], he had a normal head CT, negative UA/lytes and
was discharged home. He subsequently saw an ophthalmologist 2
days ago who stated his "eyes were fine". He was enroute to have
a repeat head CT today and in the ambulance was noted to have a
slight decrease in BP to the 90's and ?slurred speech (which he
states is not slurred, just his mouth is very dry). He also had
1 minute of chest pain which he describes as SSCP [**2-10**], no
associated N/V, +lightheadedness, no fevers, no radiation of
chest pain. +chronic SOB. Thus, he was brought into the ED. He
states that he has chronic SOB and lately, if he bends over to
feed his cat, his SOB worsens. He also states he sleeps upright
in his wheelchair at night because he doesn't like his hospital
bed at home.
.
In the AM of [**2127-10-14**], the patient was noted to have a SBP around
80, and was given a 500cc fluid bolus. Later that AM, the
patient was again found to have SBP in the 80s, asymptomatic,
and was given another 250cc fluid bolus. The patient then became
unresponsive, slumped over, and mumbling. His O2 saturation
dropped and his SBP went from 80s to 50-60 range. A code blue
was called. The patient was placed on NRB with good O2 response.
He was then started on levophed 0.04 with good response and SBP
into the 100-110s. He was given a head CT and torso CT
(negative) and admitted to the CCU. He was started on stress
dose hydrocortisone, and maintained adequate BP from 110-140
systolic. He was then transferred back to the primary medical
team for further care.

.
MIBI: Normal Persantine MIBI study with a left ventricular
ejection
fraction calculated to be 52%.
.
CT head: No evidence of acute mass effect, hemorrhage or
territorial infarction. Question raised about possible
abnormality in the right basal ganglia. See above discussion.
.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: A large bleb in
the right lung is unchanged. There is minor bibasilar
atelectasis with tiny bilateral pleural effusions. No
lymphadenopathy is identified in the mediastinum, hila or
axillae. The aorta is not dilated, although it contains mural
calcifications. There is a right-sided dual lead [**Month/Day/Year 4448**]. A
calcified granuloma is seen in the left lung base.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is poor
vascular enhancement by IV contrast, which may be due to the
patient's cardiac status. On this limited scan, the liver,
gallbladder, spleen, stomach, adrenals, pancreas and right
kidney are unremarkable. Multiple round low-density lesions are
seen in left kidney. No lymphadenopathy is identified. There is
no free fluid in the abdomen. The aorta is normal in caliber and
contains mural calcifications, however, there is no unusual
retroperitoneal density to suggest a hematoma.
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are
calcifications within the iliac vessels, without evidence of an
extravasation. Bowel loops, distal ureters, and Foley containing
bladder are unremarkable.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Chest Pain:  The patient was admitted to internal medicine.
An EKG was performed which revealed no changes from previous.
Cardiac troponins were drawn and were shown to be flat.  Because
the patient has a history of CAD s/p PCI in [**2-/2127**], a Persantine
MIBI scan was performed to assess for restenosis.  This scan
revealed normal cardiac perfusion with an estimated 52% EF.  The
patient experienced a resurgence of his chest pain during the
period of hypotension that occurred during his hospitalization.
Repeat EKG again showed no change, and repeated serial troponins
were negative.
.
#. Hypotension:  as noted in the HPI, the patient experienced
brief hypotension in the ambulance PTA.  The pat
