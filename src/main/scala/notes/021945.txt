Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:

#) Upper GI Bleed: The patient presented with a HCT of 30, down
from a reported baseline of 45. His INR was 1.3. NG lavage was
performed in the ED and immediately returned 400cc coffee ground
material. NG tube continued to return bright red blood upon
transfer to MICU. A protonix drip was begun. The patient's HCT
dropped to 28 and he received 3U PRBCs, after which his HCT
increased to 32. GI performed an EGD on [**7-5**] and found a small
actively bleeding ulcer in the gastric portion of a hiatal
hernia. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery and 3mg
epinephrine injection. The patient's HCT remained stable during
the rest of his MICU course and he did not need additional
transfusions. A repeat endoscopy was performed on [**7-5**] that
showed no bleeding at the ulcer site. GI recommended a repeat
endoscopy in 4 weeks. An H Pylori antibody screen was performed
that showed was negative.  Patient was advised to follow up with
his [**Location (un) 2274**] gastroenterologist to have a repeat endoscopy.

#) Hypocalcemia: The patient's initial Ca was low at 7.0. His
hypocalcemia worsened with blood transfusion, and he was given
4g calcium gluconate repletion.   On the day of discharge his
corrected calcium was 7.9.  He has a border line low vitamin D
level, so he was advised to continue his vitamin D and he was
also started on oral calcium supplementation.  He denied any
symptoms of tetany or oral paresthesias.  He will see his PCP
the week after discharge and will need to have his calcium level
rechecked at that time.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 724**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for bleeding from an ulcer in
your esophagus. You received 3 units of blood. You had an
endoscopy on [**7-5**] to control the bleeding and a repeat endoscopy
on [**7-7**] that showed no more bleeding.

You will need another endoscopy in 4 weeks to check on your
ulcer. We have given you omeprazole (prilosec) to control acid
in your stomach that may contribute to ulcer formation. We have
also given you carafate, which will protect your stomach from
acid. Please continue to take these medications until your
doctor tells you to stop.  Since you have an ulcer in your
stomach that recently bled, please eat bland, less fatty meals
over the next month.

Your calcium level was also a little low, probably due to the
blood that you received.  Please see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Tuesday to get
it rechecked.  Also, please take your calcium and vitamin D.  If
you start to experiencing twitching or feeling of numbness
around your mouth, please seek medical attention immediately as
it may mean that your calcium level is too low.  You can
continue your blood pressure medication; it will not reduce your
calcium level.
