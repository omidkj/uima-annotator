Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain
Abnormal ECG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old man with a history of PVD, Barrett's
esophagus admitted on [**9-8**] to [**Hospital3 **] for elective LE
angiogram and underwent bilateral iliac stenting.  Shortly after
the procedure, the patient became hypoxic and febrile and was
diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia (started on
ampicillin-sulbactam on [**9-9**]). Also, at 2:00 AM on [**9-9**], the
patient had an episode of chest pain lasting 20 minutes
associated with 1mm horizontal ST depressions in V3-V6 that
resolved in approximately 30 minutes.  He had other episodes at
7:00AM on [**9-9**], and 9:30PM on [**6-9**], and 12:41AM on [**6-10**].  The
pain was initially relieved with sublingual nitroclyerin but due
to recurrent episodes of rest pain, he was eventually started on
nitroglycerin gtt and heparin gtt, aspirin and beta-blocker.  He
reportedly had 6 sets of negative troponins. Of note, patient's
hematocrit was 41.8 on admission and 31.8 at 4:30 AM on [**6-9**].
On the day of transfer, his hematocrit was 28.8 and he was
transfused 1 unit PRBC with 20mg furosemide IV.  The patient's
last episode of chest pain was at 2pm, responsive to nitrates.
Today patient was requiring 100% NRB to keep sats in the mid to
high 90's.  Yesterday, sats were 88% on 6 liters. He was
evaluated by cardiology consultation at [**Hospital3 4107**] and
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and dyspnea
as above.  No history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
AP chest ([**9-10**]):
Extensive heterogeneous consolidation of the right lung more
likely pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage than asymmetric
pulmonary edema since the left lung shows only borderline
vascular congestion and there may be a second region of
consolidation at the medial aspect of the left lung base, and
the heart is normal size.  Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal.
 There is suggestion of a hiatus hernia.
.
Echo ([**9-12**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
systolic function and moderate diastolic dysfunction. Mild right
ventricular dilation with mild estimated pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the CCU for further work-up and treatment of
his shortness or breath, chest pain and fever.  The following
issues were adressed:
.
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis
Pt was thought have aspirated causing a severe chemical
pneumonitis as CXR suggested a large R sided infiltrates in both
upper, middle and lower lung.  Pt had a mild fever on
presentation and was on Ampicillin sulbactam on presentation
from OSH but clinically never had a cough and no bump in the
white count so pt likely did not have aspiration pneumonia.  Due
to the large AA gradient and oxygen demand (pt had to be on
no-rebreather for 48 hrs before transitioning placed on nasal
canula) the abx course was finished with complete 7-day course
on [**2177-9-16**] (in case there was a partial penumonia as part of
the infiltrate)
.
2. Chest pain
Given absence of biomarker elevation and ST depressions only in
the setting of aspiration, hypoxia and anemia as well as
improvement and resolution, the primary team had low suspicion
for acute coronary syndrome.  Pt was monitored on tele without
any significant events.  Cardiac enzymes were checked again and
were negative.  When pt first prsented, heparin gtt,
nitroglycerin gtt, was continued but then eventually stopped.
Aspirin, atenolol, valsartan, lisinopril, and atorvastatin were
continued (amlodipine was also continued for blood pressure
control).  TTE was done on the morning after admission to assess
for new wall-motion abnormality and demonstrated mild left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function and
moderate diastolic dysfunction (EF>55%). It also showed mild
right ventricular dilation with mild estimated pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  He was discharged with instructions to
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**] for a stress test within 1 week.
.
3. Acute diastolic heart failure - Patient clinically was found
to have CHF based on crackles at bilateral bases, bilateral
infiltrates on chest x-ray. He was diuresed approximately 4
litres.  He was discharged on prescription for furosemide 20mg
daily to maintain his fluid balance.  Continued lisinopril,
valsartan.
.
4. GERD - Continued pantoprazole
.
5. Diet-controlled DM - Insulin sliding scale while in house.
.
6. PPx - Continued pantoprazole
