Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Hip fracture

3. IVC Filter Placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 yo male with a PMH of atrial fibrillation,
dementia, CAD, CHB s/p PM, and HTN who presents as a transfer
from OSH with R hip fracture.  The patient initially was
diagnosed with a left hip fracture in [**2189-3-12**] at which
time he was transferred from the Bahamas to [**Hospital1 18**].  During that
admission he was noted to have a NSTEMI in the preoperative time
period, subsequently underwent L hip ORIF, and then had a
complicated post-op course notable for hypotension, shock,
sepsis, MRSA pneumonia, and torsades requiring defibrillation
due to QT prolongation from haldol.  He was discharged to rehab
on [**4-18**] where he had a mechanical fall while walking back to his
bed from the bathroom under his own power (he was supposed to be
helped with all OOB activity), when he tripped and sustained a R
hip fracture (impacted, slightly displaced, subcapital hip
fracture per OSH x-ray).  At the OSH, the patient was noted to
have a supratherapeutic INR >10 but stable hematocrit. He was
given 2 units FFP and 5mg sc vitamin K with decrease of INR to
4.4. Lasix was held due to acute renal failure (Cre 1.8,
baseline 1.2-1.3). Three sets of TnI were checked and were
negative (<0.04). Labs were notable for WBC 8.2 and Hct 35.9.
The family requested that the patient be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for repair of his hip fracture.
.
On medicine floor, pt. taken for R hip repair but noted to have
abscess over L hip repair site. Abscess drained on [**5-31**] with
gram stain + for GPC. Tx c vancomycin and VAC dressing. On am of
[**6-1**], pt. noted to be hypotensive to 80/50 but afebrile c VAC
dressing draining blood, morning hct decreased from 32 to 22
from previous day. Pt was given boluses of normal saline, with
temporal response, and then prbc transfusion was begun.
Transfered to MICU where pt received 2 units PRBC and hct/BP
stabilized.  He went for washout of his L hip with vac drain
change today.
