Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Back and Abd pain, MRCP with biliary dilation and ? IPMN

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincteroromy

History of Present Illness:
63f h/o severe copd on 4.5L 02 at home, insulin dependent
diabetes type 2, obesity, afib on coumadin, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**8-19**] with lower
chest pain and epigastric pain and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cosnideration of ERCP.  Her hospital course is significant for
MRCP with prominent intrahepatic dilatation, without change from
[**2191**] and mild dilated pancreatid duct and transaminitis.  She
had a TTE with EF 55 and mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], chest CTA neg for PE
but with compression fracture of thoracic spine.  Her coumadin
was held but given yesterday so vit K PO given this AM with last
INR of 1.42.

Currently she complains of severe pain diffusely, including
mid-back.  She is not more SOB than her usual.  She has new L
leg swelling.  She denies vomiting, or diarrhea.  She does not
relate abdominal pain to meals, food, or activity.  She can walk
slowly and prepare meals but is dyspnic with any stairs.  She
denies chest pressure.

Complete 13 point ROS is negative except for the above items.

[**Hospital1 18**] Studies:
CXR ([**2196-8-28**])-IMPRESSION:
Emphysema. Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base.
Compression
deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body, likely chronic.
.
LENI ([**2196-8-28**])- No DVT in left lower extremity.
.
ERCP ([**8-29**]):
Procedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Impression: Severe biliary dilation with CBD measuring 20 mm,
with findings consistent with severe sphincter stenosis.
Sphincterotomy was successfully performed
Otherwise normal ERCP to third part of the duodenum

EKGs:
EKG [**2196-8-19**] at [**Hospital3 **]: Afib, rate 120, normal axis,
normal QRS and QT intervals. TWI in II, III, AvF. 1-2mm STD in
V2-V6.
.
EKG [**2196-8-28**] at [**Hospital1 18**] during episode of [**11-7**] CP: Poor study.
Afib rate 96, NA, normal QRS and QT intervals. ? TWI in II, III,
AvF. qmm ST depressiions in V2-V6.
.
EKG [**2196-8-29**] at [**Hospital1 18**] when STD seen on telemetry: A-fib rate 72,
NA, normal QRS and QT intervals. 1mm ST depressions in II, III,
AvF, and V4-V5.






Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
63f h/o severe copd on 4.5L 02 at home, insulin dependent
diabetes type 2, obesity, afib on coumadin, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**8-19**] with lower
chest pain and epigastric pain and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ERCP.

Active Diagnoses:
#Biliary ductal dilatation, sphincter stenosis: Appeared stable
per MRCP report compared with images from [**2191**], but she has
periods of transient elevation in LFTs.  ERCP revealed both
significant ductal dilation and sphincter stenosis.  The latter
was treated with sphincterotomy. LFTs improved during
hospitalization.  Patient was told she should follow-up on LFTs
as outpatient.

#Afib: currently rate controlled.  Anti-coagulation was held for
the procedure and for 5 days thereafter per GI recommendations.
(plan to restart coumadin on [**9-3**])  Other cardiovascular
medications were continued with no significant perturbation in
HR or BP.

#COPD:  The patient has a high O2 requirement at home (4.5L NC),
and initial evaluation for procedure was concerning for
respiratory function.  Following ERCP, she remained intubated
for roughly 18 hours.  She was extubated the morning of [**8-30**]
with good results.  Home prednisone dose was continued.  Was
told to f/u w/ PCP re need for PJP ppx given chronic steroids.

#L lower extremity erythema: Consistent with underlying venous
stasis and superimposed cellulitis, given warm, blanching
erythema. Started on antibiotics (doxycycline) and told to f/u
with PCP.

#Chest Pain:  On the evening of admission ([**2196-8-28**]) she
complained of [**11-7**] chest pain that was different from her
epigastric pain. Notably, she has had a clean cath in [**2191**] and
negative stress test in [**2195**]. EKG [**8-28**] was largely stable from
prior at [**Hospital3 **], both of which showed diffuse
downsloping ST elevations consistent with digitalis effect. Pain
improved with nitro SL and she was given diltiazem for rate
control. Cardiac enzymes were negative x3. A f/u EKG on [**2196-8-29**]
was again consistent with digitalis effect.

#Back pain: thoracic compression fx, likely secondary to chronic
steroid use.  Home pain regimen continued.
Patient was told to follow-up with her PCP regarding her bone
density and possible osteoperosis.  She was continued on Ca/Vit
D.

Chronic Diagnoses:
#OSA:  Following extubation, nocturnal BiPAP was continued per
home regimen.

#Diabetes type 2, complicated:  Home insulin regimen continued,
with adjustment as appropriate while NPO.

#Kidney masses: NOS, found on CTA of chest, but MRCP of abdomen
only described bilateral simple renal cysts.  The patient was
told to follow-up on this issue with her PCP.

Transitional issues:
Code status: FULL (confirmed)
Patient was told to schedule an appointment with her PCP to
[**Name9 (PRE) 702**] LFTs, her antibiotic course, bone density, and kidney
masses found on CTA.
