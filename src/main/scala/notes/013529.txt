Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
broken insulin [**First Name3 (LF) 4581**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
53 y/o F w/ h/o DMI, CAD s/p CABG, recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]
for DKA c/b "vagal" cardiac arrest [**2129-7-4**] p/w tx from OSH (LGH)
for DKA. Patient states her pumped stopped working 1 day PTA.
She presented to OSH and glucose was 705. Got 3L IVFs, 10U
insulin and started at gtt at 4U/hr. Initially had epigastric
pain and chest pain that was resolved on arrival. She denies
dysuria, rashes, diarrhea, cough, shortness of breath, f/c/s in
the past day. She states chest pain is more of an epigastric
burning which was different from her "angina" pain prior to her
CABG in [**2113**]. Her cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13114**] who saw her in ED.
.
Initial Vitals: 98.0  90  141/70 16 100%
Gap closed, Cre up to 1.7 from 1.1, WBC 7 trop neg on arrival.
EKG with changes from [**2129-6-10**] (AvR elevation, ST depression in
V5/V6 I, II, AvF. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted. Recs below:
[**Last Name (un) **] recs: lantus 12U QHS, SS breakfast and dinner 80-120 with
4U, lunch 3U, increase by 1U each 50mg/dl increment in glucose.
HS SS start 200-250 with 4U

During episode after emesis, vagaled to HR 40s SBP 70s, trigger
called. Total IVF = 3L in ED. Decision was to admit for ACS rule
out and hyperglycemia mgmt. BG was >400 when sent to ICU.
.
On Arrival to floor, pt complained of worsening SOB, EKG showed
changes more prominent than prior, Trops were drawn neg >0.5,
WBC 21, other electrolytes ok, CXR showed pulmonary edema. Gap
opened up with HCO3> 11. Cards called, ASA, Metoprolol, Statin,
Heparin GTT started, home plavix given. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13114**] was called,
stated he felt this was Type II or demand MI [**2-10**] DKA and
possible underlying stress/infection. She was kept on heparin
overnight and DKA managed by placing back on insulin gtt at 5/hr
w/ q1-2 FS and q3-4 C10. She was persistently sinus tachy but
felt [**2-10**] beta blocker withdrawal per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13114**]. 20mg IV lasix
given w/ >1000L output.

DISCHARGE LABS

MICRO:
[**10-21**] URINE CULTURE NEGATIVE FINAL
[**10-20**] [**Month/Year (2) 3143**] CULTURE __________

IMAGING:
[**10-20**] CXR; FINDINGS:  Two views were obtained of the chest.  The
lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion
or pneumothorax.  Post-CABG changes are seen with normal heart
size and mediastinal contours.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.

[**10-21**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the septum and anterior wall. The remaining
segments contract normally. Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 36%. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-2**],
the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19075**] [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year old female with history of
diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD)
s/p CABG, recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA) complicated by "vagal" cardiac arrest [**2129-7-4**] who
presented from OSH (LGH) for elevated [**Month/Day/Year **] sugars and DKA in
setting of insulin [**Month/Day/Year 4581**] battery malfunction. DKA course was
complicated by non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
likely secondary to demand ischemia.
.
# DKA: Inciting cause due to insulin [**Month/Day/Year 4581**] malfunction. No
obvious infection although WBC elevated--urinalysis was
negative, no obvious cellulitis or pneumonia.  Ischemia is a
possible inciting event since she presented with chest pain
initially and firt enzymes were negative then trended up,
consistent with timing of acute event upon
