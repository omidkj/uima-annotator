Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for bilateral pulmonary embolism.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Catheter placement
Arterial Line placement
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 51-year-old female status-post recent bilateral breast
reduction surgery complicated by infection status-post recent
discharge from OSH for chest pain presented to OSH in PEA arrest
with PE on CT scan status-post thrombolytics.
.
Patient underwent bilateral breast reduction surgery several
weeks ago prior to this admission.  Per report from [**Location (un) 620**] this
course was complicated by infection.  Patient was recently
admitted and discharged day prior to admission from
[**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesly for left sided chest pain, which was attributed
to neuropathic post surgical pain.
.
On night of admission, patient's husband heard her fall
upstairs.  She was alert and orientated complaining of left leg
pain. EMS were called and she reportedly arrested in front of
EMS. In the field EMS performed CPR for 20 minutes, she received
3 rounds of Epi and Atropine and responded with a rhythm of
sinus tachycardia. In the ED she went into PEA arrest again and
was given another round of Epi/Atropine and 3 minutes of CPR.
She again responded with sinus tachycardia. She then coded again
and received CPR for another 2 minutes with a round of epi. She
was intubated in the ED with gases showing pH 6.80, pCO2 77, pO2
243.  A CTA was performed, which showed a large PE.  Patient was
given tPA at 725 and finished at 925am. She was noted to have
some oozing at her surgical site of her right breast with tPA
and was binded with a strap.  She was also started on Levophed
given hypotension to 70s.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on Heparin gtt
at 930am. She was noted to have non-focal movement of her upper
extremities. Her labs were noted to be remarkable for a
+d-dimer, elevated Creatinine 1.4, trans. ABG showing acidosis
of 6.80 likely mixed given CO2 of 77, CO2 17. Prior to her
transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] vital signs were 90/50 on 20 of Levophed,
HR 120, RR 20-25 intubated, Sat 100%.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**1-24**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: The right ventricle is mildly dilated with free wall
hypokinesis. The RV apex is contractile ([**Doctor Last Name 97772**] sign).
These findings are consistent with a pulmonary embolus. Normal
regional and global LV function without significant valvular
abnormality.
.
CXR [**1-24**]:
1. Low-lying endotracheal tube, only 1.2 cm above the carina.
Tube could be withdrawn several centimeters for more optimal
positioning.
2. Pneumomediastinum.
3. Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
4. Cardiomegaly, with abnormal left ventricular contour. This is
worrisome
for development of left ventricular aneurysm, and
echocardiography is
recommended for correlation. Alternatively, this could represent
a lung mass projecting over the left heart border. If
echocardiography is not revealing, further evaluation with chest
CT is recommended.
5. Abnormal catheter or wire like fragment projecting over the
right heart
border, extending into the liver. If there is no wire or
catheter fragment
external to the patient which could project in this position,
this finding is worrisome for a retained catheter or wire
fragment, possibly located within the SVC, extending into a
hepatic vein. Lateral chest radiograph is
recommended for correlation.

[**2129-1-25**]
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Persistent nephrograms bilaterally, consistent with ATN.
There is a
heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys, left greater than right
with wedge-shaped areas of decreased density. These could
represent areas of infarct versus differential function.
3. Colonic distention and focal wall thickening of the
transverse colon,
which may be infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic (particularly
given recent cardiac arrest). Distention may be due to stool
retention.

Final Report
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
14.4 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m RBC ([**2129-1-30**]);
HISTORY:51 yo F with ongoing bloody bowel movements and falling
Hct.
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained. A left
lateral view of the pelvis was not obtained secondary to lack of
patient cooperation. Blood flow images show no areas of abnormal
tracer activity.Dynamic blood pool images show increased tracer
activity within the first 90 minutes in the region of the
pelvis, overlying the left iliac vessels and progressing more
centrally and inferiorly within the pelvis, likely corresponding
to the sigmoid colon or rectum. The patient refused additional
delayed images.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with probable active hemorrhage
in the region of the sigmoid colon or rectum.
.
[**2129-1-31**] Doppler U/S LExt
HISTORY: PE and GI bleed, on anticoagulation. Question DVT.
FINDINGS: The bilateral common femoral veins demonstrate normal
spectral
waveforms symmetric bilaterally. There is normal
compressibility, color flow and response to augmentation in the
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal
veins. The bilateral calf veins demonstrate normal flow.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
LENIs [**2129-2-8**]:
BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
Doppler images of
the bilateral internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,
basilic, and
cephalic veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and
augmentation. A
PICC line is present in the left cephalic vein. Targeted
ultrasound of the
area of discomfort in the medial left acromioclavicular fossa
demonstrates no
subcutaneous edema.

IMPRESSION: No DVT in right or left upper extremity.
