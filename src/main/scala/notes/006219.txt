Pertinent Results:
[**2114-2-16**] Intraop TEE:
PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild to moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
[**Hospital1 **]-leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the study.

graft x3,(left internal mammary  artery to left anterior
descending artery and saphenous vein grafts to the obtuse
marginal artery and posterior descending artery)with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

and sedated for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
weaned off pressor support and beta-blocker/statin/aspirin and
diuresis was initiated. All lines and drains were discontinued
per proptocol. He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred
to the Step down unit on postoperative day one. Physical Therapy
was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. His
postoperative course was essentially uncomplicated. He
complained of dysphagia and a speech and swallow eval was done.
