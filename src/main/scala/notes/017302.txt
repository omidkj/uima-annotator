Admission Date:  [**2114-2-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-3-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2089-1-25**]       Sex:  F

Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 25-year-old
woman without a significant past medical history found down
in the shower after her roommate heard her yell out.  She was
unable to speak shortly thereafter and was unable to move her
right side.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included only
oral contraceptive pills.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed her temperature was 97.6, blood pressure was 178/63,
heart rate was 80, respiratory rate was 12.  She was sedated
and paralyzed.  Pupils were reactive.  The left pupil was
larger than the right by 2 mm.  Her chest was clear to
auscultation.  Her respiratory rate was regular.  Her chest
was clear.  The abdomen was soft and nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Her
laboratories revealed sodium was 145, potassium was 3.7,
chloride was 113, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was
10, creatinine was 0.7, and blood glucose was 127.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On arrival to the hospital, the patient
was obtunded and vomiting.  A computed tomography showed a
large left intraparenchymal hematoma extending from the basal
ganglion to the internal capsule into the periventricular
[**Known lastname **] matter, and positive blood in the ventricles, with 4 mm
of midline shift (from left to right).  A ventricular drain
was placed under high pressure, and the patient was taken to
the operating room for a decompressive craniectomy.

In the operating room, she had 2 liters of fluid, 2 units of
fresh frozen plasma, 1 unit of packed red blood cells, and a
urine output of 2800 cc.  She arrived from the Postanesthesia
Care Unit with a drain in placed, sedated, paralyzed, and
intubated.

The patient was on a Fentanyl drip, Nipride, cefazolin, and
famotidine.

She was admitted to the Neurologic Surgical Intensive Care
Unit status post a hematoma evacuation and craniectomy.  She
tolerated the procedure well.  There were no intraoperative
complications.

Postoperatively, she remained intubated, sedated, and
paralyzed.  She had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in place.  Her
pupils continued to be reactive.  The left frontal area where
a bone flap was removed remained soft and not under any
tension.  Her vital signs remained stable.

On [**2114-2-14**], [**2113**] the patient was taken to the
angiogram suite where an arteriovenous malformation was found
being fed from the left anterior choroidal artery and to a lessr
extent from the left posterior cerebral artery.  The anterior
choroidal artery harbored a feeding artery aneurysm which was
felt to be the rupture site.  She had a second endovascular
procedure where the anterior choroidal artery was catheterized
and the aneurysm was occluded using NBCA injection without
intraprocedural complications.

On [**2114-2-16**], the patient was off sedation.  Her
pupils were 3 mm down to 2 mm and reactive.  Her cranial
defect was soft.  She was localizing with her left upper
extremity and withdrawing her lower extremities.  She spiked
a temperature to 101.5 on [**2-16**] and was fully cultured.
The patient was receiving Cephazolin for the drain
prophylaxis.  No other antibiotics at that time.

On [**2114-2-18**], the patient grew out gram-negative rods in
her sputum.  She was started on levofloxacin.

On [**2114-2-20**], the patient's pupil were 4 mm down to 3 mm
and symmetric.  She was moving left side spontaneously and
localizing on the right throughout her lower extremities.
She did open her right eye spontaneously.  The patient was on
levofloxacin and ceftazidime for gram-positive cocci in pairs
in the sputum and also in the urine.

[**2114-2-23**], the patient had a tracheostomy and
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed without
complications.  She continued to remain neurologically the
same.  The pupils were 4 mm down to 3 mm.  She was moving her
left side spontaneously.  She opened the right eye more than
the left eye and withdrew on the right side.  She continued
to have vent drain in place and was continued on levofloxacin
and ceftazidime for heavy growth of gram-positive cocci in
her sputum.

Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were sent periodically
throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay; all of which were
negative for organisms.

She also had periodic computed tomography scans which showed
improvement and reabsorption blood with no new hemorrhages
present.

On [**2114-3-6**], the patient was taken back to the
operating room and had her cranial defect repaired.  She also
had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed without
intraoperative complications.

The patient was then transferred to the regular floor.
Neurologically, she remained unchanged.  She was opening her
right eye and was attentive.  She was moving the left side
spontaneously.  The right side withdrew to pain.  She was
followed by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and
will require long-term acute rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications on discharge
included)
1.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.12h.
3.  Artificial Tears one to two drops both eyes as needed.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in one month
2.  The patient will need to receive stereotactic radiosurgery
of the remnant AVM fed by the PCA.
3.  The patient will require staple removal on postoperative
day 10 from her shunt.  She had a shunt placed on [**2114-3-9**].  Her staples should come out on [**2114-3-19**].
