Brief Hospital Course:
1. Asthma exacerbation/Respiratory failure: As detailed in HPI.
Initially admitted with simple asthma exacerbation, treated with
nebs and steroids. However, on the night of [**2128-5-30**], she
developed progressively worsening shortness of breath, not
responsive to nebs. HR 89, bp 212/121, resp 25, 100% on 100% FM.
She received Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 for suspected CHF contributor.
Repeat CXR was without evidence of infiltrate or CHF and ABG
7.11/104/108 on 100% FM. MICU service was called to evaluate and
the decision was made to urgently intubate, given patient's
declining mental status. Pt remained in ICU for 2 days with
uneventful course and successful extubation. Ms. [**Known lastname 32661**] was
transferred back to the medicine floor and demonstrated marked
improvement after extubation. Alberol/atrovent MDIs were
continued with rescue nebs prn as patient required, though she
did not use any prn nebs. She was discharged on albuterol and
atrovent MDIs, as well as with home nebs for prn use, and with a
prednisone taper.

exacerbation and respiratory failure during this admission,
