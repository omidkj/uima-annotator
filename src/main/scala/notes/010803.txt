[**2178-5-11**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA with 70% ostial and 70-80% distal lesions.
The LAD
had an 80-90% stenosis after D1. The LCX was totally occluded
proximally
and filled distally via left-left collaterals. The RCA had a 90%

proximal lesion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension of 170 mmHg. LVEDP was elevated at 24 mmHg. There
was no
gradient across the aortic valve.
[**2178-5-12**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was notified in person of
the results on [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 28412**] in the operating room before the
surgical start
POST-BYPASS:
There was a mild to moderate RV systolic dysfunction especially
in the diaphgragmatic surface of the RV. Patient was placed on
an epinephrine drip 0.02 mcg/kg/min. Thoracic aortic contour is
intact. Minimal MR, TR.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for cardiac catherization on [**2178-5-11**], which revealed
left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.  He was
admitted and underwent surgical evaluation.  On [**2178-5-12**] he went
to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery.  Please see operative report for further
surgical details.  He received Vancomycin for perioperative
antibiotics, since he was in the hospital preoperatively for
greater than 24 hours. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
experienced short runs of ventricular tachyacardia and was
temporarily started on Lidocaine with transition to beta
blockade.  He otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one. His epicardial
wires and chest tubes were removed.  He was seen in consultation
by physical therapy on POD 3.  Later that same day was ready for
discharge to home.
