HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the General
Surgery Service, taken to an Operating Room where he
underwent exploratory laparotomy with a sigmoid colectomy,
small bowel resection, and sigmoid colostomy and lysis of
adhesions.  Please see operative note for details.

Preoperatively, the patient was transfused with four units of
fresh frozen plasma to reverse his INR.  He was started on
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

The patient postoperatively was started on Lovenox.  His
nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day two.
He remained n.p.o.  The patient started to ambulate.  On
postoperative day three, Vancomycin was discontinued and
Foley was removed.  The patient was started on Coumadin p.r.
On postoperative day three, the patient was found to have
hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, which was repleted with
intravenous and he was continued on Levofloxacin and
Coumadin.  The patient is working with Physical Therapy and
ambulating with help.

Postoperative day six, the patient is taking clears and
tolerating that well.  He had moderate amount of stool in his
ostomy bag.  On postoperative day six, the patient also
started complaining of abdominal pain and had some distention
and tenderness.  He had a CT scan suspicious for a partial
small bowel obstruction.

His pain medication was stopped and then restarted morphine
on a low dose.  A G-tube was placed; he was placed n.p.o. and
started on intravenous fluids.

Hematology/Oncology was consulted for continued high white
blood cell count.

On postoperative day nine, the patient started having melena
and hematemesis.  He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which
showed some erythema and congestion in the stomach compatible
with nasogastric tube trauma.  No bleeding sites were
identified.  Laparotomy site was not visualized.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  He
was transfused fresh frozen plasma to correct his
coagulopathy as well as packed red blood cells for fall in
hematocrit and started on total parenteral nutrition.

Because of the patient's bleeding problem and need for
protection from pulmonary embolism, he had an IVC filter
placed.  His hematocrit stabilized over postoperative day
nine and ten.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
number thirteen and was continuing on total parenteral
nutrition and intravenous fluids, with strict n.p.o.   He
continued to have minimal ostomy output.

On postoperative day number seventeen, the patient continued
on total parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids.  He was
starting to pass gas and was otherwise stable.

Postoperative day number nineteen, the patient continued to
have pain.  He had an ostomy enema which he tolerated well
with minimal outcome.  He had a KUB which showed no evidence
of partial small bowel obstruction.  No dilated loops of
bowel and a normal gas pattern.  There was some residual oral
contrast.

He was given a dose of Milk of Magnesia.  He continues to
have a lot of pain and the Pain Service was consulted.  The
patient was started on a Duragesic patch.

On postoperative day number twenty, the patient had improved.
He had significantly decreased pain.  Nasogastric tube was
clamped with minimal residual.  His ileus was resolving.  His
nasogastric tube was removed.  His intravenous fluids were
stopped.  He was started on sips and advanced to clears which
the patient tolerated well.

afebrile, with vital signs stable, tolerating diet.  His pain
is well controlled.
