History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old female with h/o MI, PVD and stage V CKD.
She was recently hospitalized in early [**Month (only) 547**] at [**Hospital3 3583**]
for a perforated gastic ulcer s/p surgical repair with a
complicated post-op course with MI and repiratory failure
requiring intubation. She was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab on
[**4-24**]. On [**5-2**], she developed respiratory distress
and was brought to Good samarita. She became hypotensive and was
placed on Neo briefly. Thought was that she was septic from PNA
and UTI, treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. She was placed
on BIPAP for respiratory distress. Then she developed chest pain
and EKG was interpreted as STEMI in the precordial leads, which
was later read as J pt elevations by the consultant
cardiologist. She had CK's to 30's, MB 7.8 and troponins was
0.66 and 0.56. She had recurrent chest pain, and was sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
.
At Catheterization, she had an 80% LCx that was fixed with a
BMS. She has a totally occluded RCA that was fed by collaterals.
LM and LAD had minimal dz. Wedge pressure was 20.
.
ROS: Denies chest pain, SOB, orthopnea, PNA, claudications,
peripheral edema. Denies fevers, chills, abd pain, n/v/d. + back
and shoulder pain which is chronic.

Brief Hospital Course:
#NSTEMI - Patient was transfered from OSH for chest pain and
elevated troponins.  Catheterization here showed occluded Left
Circumflex and occluded Right Coronary Artery filled by
collaterals.  A Bare Metal Stent was placed to the Left
Circumflex artery.  She was chest pain free after the procedure.
 She was maintained on ASA, plavix, Beta-blocker, and statin.
An ACE-inhibitor was held because of her poor renal function.

# Acute Systolic Heart Failure: Patient presented to OSH with
CHF exacerbation and shortness of breath.  Here her EF was
decreased at 30-40%, and unknown previous.  She was diuresed and
her blood pressure was aggressively controlled.  She was weaned
from oxygen and did well.  She is not on Lasix currently given
her renal failure and euvolemic status.  ***Her volume status
should be monitored at the rehab facility and her lasix should
be administered as needed.***  Creatinine should be monitored if
she is placed back on lasix therapy.

#Severe MR: Patient was noted to have severe Mitral
Regurtitation on Echo.  The chronicity of this was unknown.  She
does not seem to be a good surgical candidate for valvular
repair or replacement.  Her blood pressure was controlled.  She
should follow up with her outpatient cardiologist regarding this
matter.
.
# CKD: Stage V kidney disease from hypertension. Her outpatient
nephrologist anticipated that it likely progressing to renal
failure requiring Hemodialysis.  After cardiac cath. she did
recieve one session of dialysis after placement of a temporary
dialysis line.  She did not require other dialysis session and
it seems her serum Creatinine is at her baseline.  She will
still likely need dialysis at some point in the future.  The
renal team made a note that a fistula should not be place on the
left given left subclavian steel syndrome.  She will need to be
monitored as before by her nephrologist.

#Mental Status Changes - At times during the hospitalization,
the patient appeared confused.  This was thought related to pain
and psychiatric medications.  The doses of these medications
were decreased and she seemed to improve.  She did continue to
complain of anxiety; a balance is needed between treating her
anxiety and making her somulent with medications.  It is also
likely that a UTI was contributing to her mental status changes.
 The UTI will be treated with a 7day course of Ciprofloxacin.
Her foley was removed.
.
#UTI - Associated with a chronic indwelling foley.  She will be
treated with Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily and is to complete a 7
day course.  The foley was removed and voiding should be
encouraged rather than replacement of the foley.  Urine culture
at the time of discharge was pending.  Rehab facility should
follow up urine culture to assure proper antibiotic coverage.

# HTN: The patient did have labile blood pressures while in the
hospital that were difficult to control at times.  We believe
that her blood pressure was a likely precipitant of her initial
presentation with heart failure.  Pressures were controlled with
the addition and titration of amlodipine and carvedilol.
.
# PVD: s/p bilateral carotid stenting.  It was necessary to take
blood pressures in her legs because of her known subclavian
stenosis.
