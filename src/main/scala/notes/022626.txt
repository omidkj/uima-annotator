HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 100574**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female who presented to the Emergency Room with chest pain
and nausea.

The patient had just returned from a dental procedure when
the pain developed.  In the Emergency Department, the patient
was treated with aspirin and admitted for observation.
During the night, the patient complained of left-sided back
pain with increased nausea.  The patient also complained of
back pain across the shoulders.  At the time of these
complaints, the patient's blood pressure was stable.
Electrocardiogram revealed no changes.

Shortly thereafter, blood pressure was checked and it was
found to be 50 to 60 systolic with a heart rate in the 60s.
Her blood pressure increased to 90 systolic with fluids.
Electrocardiogram was unchanged.  The patient was stable with
an systolic blood pressure of about 90 throughout the early
morning.  The patient was transferred to the Fernard
Intensive Care Unit for careful hemodynamic monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Esophagitis.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Asthma.
5.  Bronchitis.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q.d.
2.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Vasotec 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Flovent.
5.  Multivitamin.
6.  Ditropan-XL 10 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  CLINDAMYCIN, CARDIZEM, PENICILLIN, SULFA, and
TETRACYCLINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at a nursing home.  Her
nearest relative is a nephew who is a retired cardiologist.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 97.6,
heart rate was 70, blood pressure was 104/44.  The patient's
oxygen saturation was 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In
general, the patient was alert and oriented times three,
sitting comfortably.  Left ptosis surgical right pupil.  The
oropharynx was dry.  Neck was supple.  No jugular venous
distention.  Lung with crackles halfway up bilaterally.
Negative dullness to percussion.  Cardiovascular was regular
with a [**2-25**] to 3/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border and a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur to the apex.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  A small left ventral hernia.  Extremities were
warm and with good pulses.  A left breast mass noted on
examination.  No axillary lymphadenopathy.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
revealed white blood cell count was 2.5 ? (increased from
admission of 12.7), hematocrit was 27.3, platelets were 217.
PT was 13.5, PTT was 34.1, and INR 1.3.  Chemistry-7 was
unremarkable.  AST was 273, ALT was 229, albumin was 2.7,
total bilirubin was 1.2, alkaline phosphatase was 119.
Calcium was 7.4, iron was 18, total iron-binding capacity
was 251.  Urinalysis revealed 11 red blood cells, 8 white
blood cells, occasional bacteria.  Creatine kinase #1 was 72,
creatine kinase #2 was 351, creatine kinase #3 was 248.
CK/MB #1 was not done, CK/MB #2 was 7, CK/MB #3 was 4.
Troponin was less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed a normal
sinus rhythm with a rate of 61, QRS was 102 with a right
bundle-branch block morphology.  No acute ST-T wave changes.

A PA and lateral chest x-ray on admission revealed negative
for infiltrate, no congestive heart failure, a tortuous
aorta.

A chest x-ray this a.m. revealed increased vascular markings.
No new infiltrates.

A echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion with question
of an aortic aneurysm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, this was a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with aortic dissection; now hemodynamically stable.

In the Intensive Care Unit, after further evaluation of the
echocardiogram, it appeared that the patient had ascending
aortic dissection with a possible descending component.
Given the patient's age, and after a discussion with the
patient and her nephew who is a retired cardiologist, it was
decided to make the patient comfort measures only and do not
pursue any surgical interventions at this time.

An attempt was made to place a right internal jugular which
most likely was misplaced in the right carotid.  It was
subsequently removed, and pressure was held for 15 minutes to
30 minutes.  No expanding hematoma was noted, and there were
no further complications.  The patient was given intravenous
fluids for several hours; however, this was discontinued as
well.

On [**2195-5-13**] at 4:45 p.m., the patient became
increasingly bradycardic and hypotensive.  The family was
made aware, and the patient subsequently passed away without
further complications.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ascending and possible descending aortic aneurysm.
2.  Small right neck hematoma secondary to right central line
placement.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Transaminitis; most likely secondary to shocked liver.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient expired.
