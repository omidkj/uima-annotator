Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19198**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o hypothyroidism who awoke
at midnight with sudden onset shortness of breath. Symptoms
persisted for one hour without improvement and EMS was called.
.
History was obtained from son [**Name (NI) 3065**] as patient was intubated
and sedated at time of arrival. Patient has no prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She has not had any
recent fevers, chills or rigors, exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable only for the presence of
dyspnea at rest. ROS is negative for any report of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
In the ED, patient was intubated emergently and code STEMI was
called. She received versed 5 mg IV x 2, ativan 2 mg, ASA 600
mg, Plavix 600 mg, Integrillin bolus, Etomidate 20 mg IV, and
Succinylcholine 12 mg, and was started on a heparin gtt. A nitro
drip was initiated which resulted in hypotension. BP transiently
responded to 1.5 L of NS.

in the upstairs apartment.

There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

STUDIES:
[**10-15**] EKG:
Sinus tachycardia
Left axis deviation
IV conduction defect
Poor R wave progression - cannot rule out septal infarct
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Lateral ST-T changes may be due to hypertrophy and/or ischemia
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2111-10-15**] 5:07 AM
IMPRESSION: Too low ET tube as described should be pulled back
about 3 cm. Worsening of pulmonary edema.
.
[**2111-10-15**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.5 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Symmetric LVH with
global/regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2111-10-15**] 6:12 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19198**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman who presented to the ER with
complaints of acute onset shortness of breath. An EKG performed
at that time revealed ST elevations in V1 and V2, reciprocal ST
depressions in I and AvL, and a code STEMI was called. The
patient was emergently intubated in the ED for respiratory
distress from pulmonary edema secondary to her MI. After
discussion, it was felt that she was not a candidate for cardiac
catheterization, and she was admitted to the CCU for further
management.
.
In the CCU,  EKG changes resolved with medical management
including ASA, Plavix, Lipitor, and heparin gtt. The patient did
not tolerate nitro gtt [**2-13**] hypotension. She was initially put on
peripheral dopamine for hemodynamic support, maintaining
SBP's>90, until it was revealed the she was DNR/DNI. At that
time, an extensive family discussion ensued, and it was decided
to wean the patient off of pressors and extubate her.
.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed critical Aortic
Stenosis. Again, it was felt that the patient's condition was
too tenuous for valvuloplasty or operative repair. At this
point, per discussion with the family, the patient's goals of
care were changed to comfort measures. She was transferred to
the floor and her comfort was maintained with a morphine drip
and prn ativan.
.
On [**10-18**] the patient was noted to exhibit [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]/agonal
respirations had ceased. Family was at the bedside. PE revelaed
fixed and dilated puils, no carotid pulse, no withdrawal to
pain, and absence of cardiac sounds. Time of death pronounced at
8:55PM. Family declined an autopsy.
