Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Microsuspension laryngoscopy with micro flap excision of left
[**Last Name (un) 50614**] edema, awake fiberoptic intubation


History of Present Illness:
47M with hx of HLD, tobacco use, and occasional cocaine/crack
use who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2171-4-24**] with increasing
shortness of breath concerning for cocaine-induced chest pain.
He initially presented to the ED on [**2171-4-23**] with dyspnea and was
treated with one dose of prednisone as well as albuterol
inhalers and then discharged home. He states that his shortness
of breath actually began approximately 1.5 months ago, which he
attributed to smoking, and then it spontaneously resolved. He
presented again the following day with severe dyspnea and
initially required a 100% non-rebreather. His pulmonary exam
revealed bilateral crackles and a chest x-ray revealed pulmonary
edema. He received Aspirin and Nitroglycerin initially. His EKG
was initially unremarkable. Cardiac troponins were elevated to
0.43 later that day. Cardiology was consulted and a TTE was
performed, the results of which were pending at the time of
transfer.
.
He continued to have persistent stridor and a bronchoscopy was
performed that revealed large papillomatous tumor originating
predominantly from the left but also the right vocal cord, but,
by report, the bronchoscope was able to be easily passed through
the vocal cords. Traces of blood were noted throughout the
airway, which were suctioned. Multiple bites were taken of the
tumor and sent for pathology. A complete debulking was not
performed out of concern for the recent NSTEMI though
approximately 20% of the obstruction was removed from the
posterior commissure.
.
Given the complexity of the case and the absence adequate
services, the decision was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. Vital signs at transfer were 97.8, 102,
143/93, 18, 96% on 2L NC.
.
On arrival to the MICU, his VS were 98.2, 110, 149/92, 21,
96%RA. On further review, in addition to the details above, he
related that he felt that he was having so much trouble
breathing that he passed out at OSH. He states that he
occasionally uses crack and cocaine and last smoked crack
approximately the day prior to his admission to [**Hospital3 **].
He currently denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, N/V/D, urinary symptoms, fevers, or chills.
.

IMAGING/STUDIES:

Portable CXR [**2171-4-26**]:
FINDINGS: Single AP portable view of the chest is provided. The
cardiac,
mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. No
large pleural effusions are seen. There are no focal opacities
or consolidations. There is mild suggestion of cephalization of
the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild vascular
congestion.
.
[**4-29**] Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
1 vessel coronary artery disease. The LM and RCA were free of
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had 50-60% mid
stenosis. The
LCx had 40% mid stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 14mmHg. There was normal
systemic arterial
pressure of 130/91mmHg.
 FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate mid-LAD lesion best suited for continued medical
therapy.
2. Continue aspirin, statin, calcium channel blocker.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  47 year old man with h/o cocaine abuse and a current
smoker admitted for laryngeal mass leading to stridor and
coronary vasospasm secondary to cocaine use.
.
# Laryngeal Mass S/p Excision: Patient presented on transfer
from OSH to MICU with stable vital signs, hoarse voice, and
inspiratory stridor. Given pt's drinking and smoking history
there was concern for new squamous cancer of the vocal cords.
Patient was evaluated urgently by ENT and taken to the OR for
left vocal fold lesion excision. Clinical impression of ENT team
was [**Last Name (un) **]??????s edema likely from EtOH, tobacco, and yelling loudly
during sporting events.  Pathology pending from [**Hospital3 13347**] and [**Hospital1 18**] at time of discharge. He was evaluated the
following morning by laryngoscopy at bedside which showed patent
airway. He received 24 hours of steroids and was transferred to
the floor.  On the floor, the patient's breathing was much
improved.  He was evaluated by ENT who felt a repeat procedure
in the clinic 1-2 weeks after discharge was warranted to perform
a similar procedure on the opposite vocal cord.
.
# Coronary vasospasm: Lead to dynamic TWI's on I, II, V4-V6 with
TTE at OSH showing distal apical, septal, and anterior wall
hypokinesis with preserved EF >55%. Troponin trend at OSH and
[**Hospital1 18**] 0.01, 0.43, 0.27, 0.07, and 0.03 with normal CKMB. Patient
remained chest pain free during his stay. He had a cardiac
catheterization showing moderate mid-LAD disease, making CAD the
unlikely etiology of his chest pain.  His elevated troponin
levels with flat CK-MB suggest demand ischemia in setting of
cocaine use. PCI was n
