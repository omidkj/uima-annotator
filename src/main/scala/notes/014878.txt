Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
found down at work with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, [**2185-12-9**].


History of Present Illness:
42 year old male with DM, current TOB use who presented to OSH
with ST elevation MI (inferior and posterior MI).  Patient was
at work (painter) when his colleagues found him down and
unresponsive, unclear for how long, called EMS.  Patient was in
Vfib arrest and was coded, shocked 7 times, intubated and
transferred here for urgent cardiac catheterization.  During
cath, patient was found to have 3VD, stents placed in totally
occluded prox RCA, LAD and OM1 of LCx.  Patient also with pH
7.2, metabolic acidosis, anion gap 23, blood sugar 316 likely
DKA with WBC 21.

Past Medical History:
1. diabetes mellitus
2. hypercholesterolemia

Social History:
Lives with wife (not legally married), no children, (+)tobacco.


Family History:
Unknown.

Physical Exam:
Gen: Sedated, intubated, not responsive.
HEENT: Pupils equal minimally reactive from 4 to 3mm, intubated
CV: RRR/ST, nl S1/S2, no murmurs
Pulm: CTAB
Abd: (+) BS, soft, ND/NT
Ext: WWP, no edema, 1+ DP pulses b/l
Neuro: pupils reactive to light and accomodation, no tone,
intact gag/swallow, hypo/a-reflexic, downgoing toes b/l.

Pertinent Results:
EEG [**2185-12-21**]: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and relatively low
voltage background with occasional bursts of generalized
slowing. These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic
condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and anoxia are
among many possible causes. There were no areas of persistent
focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
.
Brain MR [**2185-12-18**]: There is no MR evidence of subacute
hemorrhage, edema, midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus
or extraaxial collections. Moderate brain atrophy noted.
Periventricular deep white matter ischemic changes noted
suggestive of mild small vessel disease. Diffusion-weighted
images demonstrate no definite evidence of restricted diffusion
to suggest acute infarct. Mucosal thickening is noted in the
maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
.
EEG [**2185-12-13**]: Mildly abnormal EEG due to a reduced voltage and
mildly slowed posterior background indicating a mild diffuse
encephalopathy.
.
CXR [**2185-12-13**]: Heterogeneous opacification in the left infrahilar
lung represent early pneumonia. Pulmonary vascular congestion
indicates borderline cardiac function. The heart size is normal
and there is no pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube tip projects
over the region of the pylorus. No pneumothorax or appreciable
pleural effusion.
.
Echo [**2185-12-12**]: LVEF 45-50%; The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include basal septal hypokinesis and
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets appear normal. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Cath [**2185-12-9**]: 1. 3VD in this R dominant circulation. The LMCA
was without angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The
mid LAD had an 80% stenosis spanning the origin of a moderate
sized D2. The D1 was a small vessel without flow limiting
disease. The LCX gave off a large OM1 that had a 90% thrombotic
stenosis in its lower pole. The RCA had a 100% proximal stenosis
consistent with fresh thrombus. 2. Resting hemodynamics
demonstrated markedly elevated left and right sided filling
pressures and depressed cardiac output/index (4 L/min and 2.0
L/min/m2) consistent with cardiogenic shock. 3. The patient had
2 episodes of unstable ventricular tachycardia which responded
to 200 J cardioversion. 4. Left ventriculogram was not performed
to decrease contrast load. 5. Successful PCI of the RCA with two
overlapping Cypher DES (2.5 x 28 mm distally and 3.0 x 33 mm
proximally), and rescue of the jailed marginal branch with a 1.5
mm balloon. 6. Successful placement of an 8 French 40 cc IABP in
the RFA. 7. Successful PCI of the LCX with a 3.0 x 28 mm Cypher
DES. 8. Successful PCI of the LAD with a 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher DES.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2.
Severe LV systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 3.
Cardiogenic shock. 4. Acute inferior ST elevation myocardial
infarction, managed by PCI of proximal RCA, mid OM1 and mid LAD
with Cypher stents. 5. Unstable ventricular tachycardia
requiring DC cardioverion. 6. Placement of intra-aortic balloon
pump via right femoral artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old male with DM, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for
emergent cath found to have 3VD s/p stents to 100% RCA ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
2), LAD ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1), OM ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1).
.
Cardiac: Pt. treated with ASA, Plavix, BB, statin, ACE-i, and
CCB.  BB and ACE-i doses titrated up for HTN.  Echo revealed
LVEF=45-50% with basal septal hypokinesis and inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. Pt. was monitored continuously on
telemetry and remained in NSR/ST with only occasional PVCs.  Pt.
may undergo repeat TTE in [**2-4**] months to evaluate interval
changes in EF/valve function.
.
Pulmonary: Pt. was intubated upon arrival to the hospital.
During a pressure-support trial off sedation, the Pt. bit
through the cuff inflator tube, and was therefore extubated.
Anesthesia saw the Pt. immediately and the Pt. was able to
protect his airway.  He was weaned down to room air, although
did initially require frequent suctioning.  At the time of
discharge, Pt. had strong gag and cough reflex, and had O2
saturations in the high 90s.
.
Neuro: Pt. was initially sedated in the setting of STEMI s/p
cath and intubation. Sedation discontinued after the Pt. was
extubated to attempt to assess neurologic status.  Concern was
for anoxic brain injury.  EEGs revealed mild diffuse
encephalopathy and no evidence of seizure activity.  MRI showed
no evidence of infarct.  Pt. was evaluated by neurology service.
 Approximately 10 days after admission, Pt. transitioned from a
non-responsive persistent vegetative state to awake, responsive,
moving all four extremities.  At the time of discharge, his
neurologic status was continually improving, but clearly
[**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation and physical/occupational therapy will
be needed to maximize recovery of function.
Patient has been enrrolled in a study with behavioral neurology.
This service is aware of him going to rehab. Patient will be
contact[**Name (NI) **] for a follow up.
.
Diabetes mellitus: Pt. had an elevated anion gap on admission,
concerning for ketoacidosis.  This gap closed with IV-fluid
resuscitation and insulin, and the Pt. had no other signs of
ketoacidosis.  His fingersticks were checked regularly and an
insulin sliding scale was used in addition to a morning and
evening dose of NPH 24qAM/24qPM.
.
Infection: Pt. was found to have an elevated WBC and fever, a
CXR was consistent with early PNA involving L infra-hilar area.
Sputum cultures grew coagulase-positive staph aureus and
streptococcus pneumoniae.  The Pt. was treated with levofloxacin
for 10-days and flagyl for 7-days.  Urine and blood cultures
were checked and were negative.
.
Dental: Pt. has very poor dentition including several missing
teeth (likely secondary to no dental insurance).  The Pt. was
seen by the hospital dental service, who recommended routine
mouth hygeine.  The Pt. was also treated with oral
chlorhexidine.
.
FEN: Tube feeds were initiated after placement of an NG-tube,
but were stopped after
