Chief Complaint:
Called by Emergency Department to evaluate
transfer from OSH for right basal ganglia bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82 year old right handed man with unknown past medical
history (although son mentions he may have HTN and diet
controlled diabetes) who has not seen a physician in years who
was "found down" this morning in his home and now transferred
for
right basal ganglia hemorrhage.

As per son, his father was independent and he had not spoken to
him in several days. Apparently he was last seen by a neighbor
2-3 days ago. Today a neighbor [**Name (NI) 653**] the building manager
and
then  found him on the floor with left sided weakness. He was
brought to [**Hospital6 4287**] where they documented that he was
conversant and that he said he fell several days ago and had a
headache.  He was tachycardic to 131, BP 144/79-160/89, was
dehydrated, and had a stage I decub over his scapula. Given 2L
NS, labs sent, and CT head showed the bleed. CT cervical spine
without fracture and sent with a C collar to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further
evaluation.

In the ED, BP 140/80. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and
imaging repeated without change in the size of the bleed.
Additional labs sent and he was admitted to the ICU for further
management.

- son says probably has HTN (not on medications)
- son says may have diet controlled diabetes

Lives alone and does his own ADLS.  Does not drive and

NCHCT Study Date of [**2113-8-17**] 8:05 PM
Unchanged right basal ganglia parenchymal hemorrhage with trace
intraventricular and mild subarachnoid extension and surrounding
edema,
without new bleeding. Stable mass effect on right lateral
ventricle, without herniation. Appearance suggests hypertensive
etiology. CTA head: Patent vasculature without stenosis,
occlusion, aneurysm or anomaly.
.
RUQ US ([**2113-9-1**]): Partially sludge-filled gallbladder. No
specific signs of cholecystitis identified.
.
CT Abdomen ([**2113-9-1**]): left effusion with atlectesis, infection
at lung base not excluded. free intra-abdominal air compatible
with recent ([**8-30**] PEG placement). PEG in stomach. large volume
stool in colon. no bowel obstruction. patent mesenteric
vasculature, but moderate atherosclerotic dz.
.
CT Head ([**2113-9-1**]): Stable appearance to right basal ganglia
hemorrhage without new hemorrhage or midline shift.
.
Bilateral Hip films ([**2113-8-29**]): Right trochanteric calcific
bursitis. No fracture or bone destruction.
.
CXR ([**2113-8-31**]): New opacities in the left lung are worrisome for
aspiration. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Aeration
of the right lung has improved. There is no evident pneumothorax
or large pleural effusion.

CT abd (prelim read): ? cholecystitis, 2 lung nodules, will need
follow up in 3 months


Brief Hospital Course:
# R basal ganglia hemorrhage: patient was admitted with R basal
ganglia hemorrhage with temporal lobe involvement. He was found
down in his apartment after an unknown period of time. In the
ICU his exam was notable for being responsive to voice, but
having erratic and disturbed consciousness. He was moving his
right upper and lower extremities purposefully and withdrawing
on the left. He was disoriented and pulled out 3 Dobhoff feeding
tubes. He did not originally pass his speech and swallow test.
Repeat testing was scheduled. Pressures were well controlled in
the unit and patient was transferred to the floor. On the
neuro-floor the patient had a repeat speech and swallow
evaluation and had failed x2. PEG tube was placed on transfer to
the medicine floor. His neurologic examination remained
unchanged except for mild improvement in his speech (slight less
dysarthria).
.
# Tachycardia, BP lability: a stat EKG was ordered and gathered
after 5mg IV metoprolol push x1. Rhythm was sinus tachycardia no
obvious ST elevation/ depression noted. 5mg IV metoprolol
resulted in HR decreasing to 100's. SBP still >160. Pt within
5-9 min had decreasing alertness a code blue was called although
he had a stable Blood pressure. 5mg IVP metoprolol was given
again. Pts pressure unresponsive to these IV pushes and pt was
transferred to the MICU team for aggressive blood pressure
control with IV drips and a repeat CT head was ordered to
evaluate expansion of the hemorrhage given acute hypertensive
emergency, with no change noted.  He was transitioned to PO
lisinopril with adequate BP control thereafter, subsequently
became hypotensive after PEG tube placement and was treated for
septis as below
.
#Fever/hypotension: initially concerning for urosepsis with cx
positive for ecoli, also concern for infection at PEG site
placement.  Surveillance blood cultures from [**2113-8-25**], [**2113-8-26**]
and [**2113-8-31**] were negative.  Urine cultures form [**2113-8-31**] were
negative.  The patient eventually grew E.Coli from both blood
and urine cultures that was pansensitive and he was transitioned
to ciprofloxacin for a 14 day course, and the IV vancomycin and
cefepime were discontinued.  He will require cipro until
([**2113-9-7**]).  Two blood cxs were pending on discharge and will
require follow up.

# Right sided eye pain: ophthomology consulted who recommended
erythomycin ointment.  He was treated with a 10 day course of
abx eye ointment.
