Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy/exhaustion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
56 year old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on sutent
presents with several days of lethargy and exhaustion. Pt. had
completed his one month of therapy, followed by one week off,
and was to start another month of therapy. Additionally, patient
complains of several days of sore throat and cough -> evaluated
by home VNA, felt to have thrush, and started on nystatin swish
and swallow qid with improvement. Pt. called oncologist this am
-> referred to the ED for hematocrit check and probable blood
transfusion -> as is what usually happens when pt. feeling as he
has been.
.
In ED, initial VS 97.5, 60, 128/56, 16, 100% on RA. Labs sent
and hct 31.4 -> no need for transfusion. EKG found to have ST
depressions/TWI in inferior & anterolateral leads -> question of
NSTEMI. Cards reportedly notified and may see patient in the am.
Pt. given asa, bb, plavix, and statin. Not started on heparin.
First set CE negative. CTA done to eval for PE -> negative. LIJ
placed for access. Pt. having couging fit and given total of
40mg oxycontin for pain (greater that his usual dose). He then
had an episode of desaturation to 88% per nursing notes. Sat
improved to 97% on 4L, but pt drowsy. Because of desaturation
and drowsiness pt admitted to ICU.

[**5-29**]. He restarted sunitinib in [**6-30**] weeks on, 4 weeks off.
He was also started on temsirolimus in early [**8-30**], last dose
[**9-20**]. He had a left subclavian port-a-cath placed on [**9-23**] for
easier chemotherapy administration in the face of poor
peripheral venous access.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2191-11-4**]): Bedside AP examinations labeled "semi-upright at
4:30 p.m. and "5 p.m." are compared with the bedside examination
done some two hours earlier; the overall appearance is
unchanged. There is a left IJ intravenous catheter reaching the
distal SVC, with no pneumothorax in this position. The vague
ground-glass opacity reported earlier is not well-demonstrated
on this examination. There is scarring or atelectasis at the
left lung base with slight elevation of this hemidiaphragm. The
patient's known extensive, expansile lytic osseous metastases
are difficult to appreciate on this study. However, there is
destruction of the end of the left fourth rib with associated
ill- defined and pleural-based soft tissue mass, as well as
expansile destruction of the right clavicular head. These
findings, as well as the patient's known spinal metastases, are
better characterized on the concurrent CTPA. Noted is gaseous
distension of numerous bowel loops in the upper abdomen, as on
the earlier study.
.
CTA ([**2191-11-4**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Interval decrease in size and extent of bilateral multifocal
ground-glass opacities, likely representing resolving
pneumonitis or pneumonia.
3. Stable metastatic disease including within the mediastinum
and bony thorax.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 56 year old man w/progressive metastatic renal cell CA
who was admitted to the intensive care unit with transient
hypoxia and EKG changes.  While in the unit, he had negative
enzymes x 2, suggesting his EKG changes may have been secondary
to demand ischemia given his low hematocrit.  He was transfused
several units with improvement in all of his symptoms.
.
His hypoxia quickly resolved after he cleared his narcotics.  He
had a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolus.  At
discharge, he was saturating >95% on RA.
.
The patient had transient hyponatremia and acute renal failure,
which resolved on the floor.
.
During this hospitalization, the patient made the decision to go
home to bridge to hospice care.  Per his request, lab draws were
kept to a minimum.
