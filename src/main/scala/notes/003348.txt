Pertinent Results:
[**2151-7-12**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is dilated. A small
secundum ASD is present. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. 2. Left ventricular wall
thicknessess is normall. The left ventricle is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%)
but in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation there may be
intrinsic dysfunction. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. 4. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic arch. 5. There are three aortic valve leaflets
which are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened and myxomatous. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail of the P2 scallop and prolapse of most of the
posterior leaflet. The anterior leaflet is slightly restricted.
An eccentric jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen
directed anteriorly. 7. There is a physiologic pericardial
effusion. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient
was receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine. 1.
An annuloplasty ring is seen well seated in the mitral position.
Trivial MR is seen. The mean gradient across the mitral valve is
4 mmof Hg and the maximum about 8 mm Hg. 2. LV function is
moderately depressed globally, with slight improvement after
starting an infusion of epinephrine. RV systolic function is
preserved. 3. Descending Aorta is intact post decannulation 4.
Other findings are unchanged and the secundum ASD is still seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73350**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On the day of admission
he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a
minimally invasive mitral valve repair. Please see operative
report for  details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on
postoperative day one, he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta blockade and aspirin
were resumed. On postoperative day one, he was transferred to
the step down unit for further recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname 73350**] was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He had a short run of
atrial fibrillation which converted to normal sinus rhythm with
and increase in his beta blockade. The physical therapy service
worked with him daily for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 73350**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day three. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**], his cardiologist and his
primary care physician as an outpatient.
