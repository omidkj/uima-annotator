Chest xray consistent with pneumonia

Chest CT: Diffuse bilateral nodular and ground-glass opacities,
with more confluent regions of bibasilar consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 43 year old man with CML transformed to ALL s/p hyperCVAD
with respiratory distress.
.
1) Resp: Patient developed a cough with decreased breath sounds
on HD 3 and that day he had an episode of respiratory distress,
desating to the low 80's.  His chest xray showed pneumonia.
Chest CTA done originally for PE was neg for PE but did show
ground glass opacities and bilobar consolidation.  Pulmonary was
consulted and patient was taken for bronchoscopy.  During the
bronchcoscopy the patient had an episode of desaturation into
the 70's and it was aborted.  Over the rest of the day, the
patient had increasing sob and was sent to the ICU for one night
due to tachypnea and desating to 90% on NRB.  He did well in the
ICU on only 3L oxygen and was transferred back in a.m.  Patient
was initially treated with vanco, levo, flagyl and then was
switched to just Levo and ceftriaxone after ID consult.  He was
also placed on pcp prophylaxis and maintained on acyclovir and
fluconazole. On discharge he was feeling much better and able to
remain on room air.  Patient was discharged on po levaquin and
will come every day to get 2gm of ceftriaxone until [**2159-2-9**].
.
2) Cardiac status - During the episode of respiratory distress
on HD 3 patient had reversible st segment depression.  Patient
with Echo with wall motion abnormalities, negative troponins.
After that day, patient did not have any ekg changes.  He will
see a cardiologist as an outpatient to consider stress test.  We
started a low dose beta blocker but because of his low bp did
not start ace and because of low platelets did not start asa.
.
3) Opth - On HD 3 patient reported a "spot" in this right eye.
The ophthamology team was consulted.  This monocular defect was
determined to be thrombocytopenic retinopathy L eye, hemorrhage
R eye. He was just given supportive treatment with platelet
transfusions and HOB> 30 degrees.  He was discharged with
ophthal follow up.

4) ALL - on HyperCVAD - chemo held
.
5) Proph - acyclovir, fluconazole, bactrim
