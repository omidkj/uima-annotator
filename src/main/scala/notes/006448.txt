Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Mitral Valve Regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mitral valve repair (32mmedwards Ring), ligation of left atrial
appendage [**2114-10-15**]
left and right heart catheterizations, coronary angiogram
[**2114-10-12**]


History of Present Illness:
This 54 year old woman with a history of mitral regurgitation
and asthmahas been experiencing cough and shortness of breath
with exertion over the last few weeks.  She was seen by her PCP
earlier in the week and was prescribed Zithromax for possible
asthma exacerbation.  She was also referred for an echo,since
she had not had one recently.

An echo was done on [**2114-10-9**] which demonstrated severe
prolapse/partial flail of the posterior mitral valve leaflet,
severe mitral regurgitation with an eccentric predominantly
posteriorly directed jet, mild tricuspid regurigation and
hyperdynamic systolic dysfunction.  Left atrium linear dimension
was moderately enlarged.

As a result of the patient's symptoms and these echo findings,
the patient has been referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1923**] (her cardiologist)
for urgent catheterization.



Past Medical History:
Mitral Regurgitation
Asthma
Scoliosis (previous surgery as child)
Vertigo

denies smoking and drinks one alcoholic beverage per month.  He
denies illicit drug use.


Family History:
Her mother died of a cerebral vascular accident in her 70's.
She has no family history of early myocardial infarction,
arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise
non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
Admit Exam:
VS: T=98.2 BP=120/63 HR=94 RR=17 O2 sat=97% RA
GENERAL: Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with JVP of at the clavicle.
CARDIAC: RRR, holosystolic murmur in all windows, loudest at the
mitral area with radiation to the carotids. No carotid bruits
auscultated.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, crackles at the bases,
otherwise clear.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits. R femoral
Catheterization site dressing c/d/i, no evidence of hematoma, no
bruit auscultated.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+  DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+


Pertinent Results:
[**2114-10-12**]: Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent disease. The LMCA,
LAD, LCx, and RCA were normal.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided
filling
pressures with a mean PCWP of 25 mmHg.  There were large V waves
on PCWP
tracing, consistent with significant mitral regurgitation. There
was moderate pulmonary  artery hypertension with a PASP of 51
mmHg. The cardiac output was preserved at rest with a cardiac
index of 3.1
L/min/m2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Mitral Regurgitation.

[**2114-10-13**] TEE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral valve leaflets are
elongated. There is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Myxomatous mitral valve with posterior leaflet
prolapse and partial flail resulting in severe, anteriorly
directed mitral regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Preserved regional and global biventricular
systolic function. Biatrial dilatation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission catheterization was performed to reveal
normal coronary anatomy and modersately elevated right heart
pressures.  On [**10-15**] she went to the operatin gRoom where mitral
repair and left atrial ligation were undertaken.  She weaned
from bypass easily on Neoynephrine and Propofol in sinus rhythm.
She awoke intact, was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
The pressor weaned off and beta blockade was begun.  Diuresis
towards her preoperative weight was begun.

Physical Therapy worked with her and she was transferred to the
step down unit.  Chest tubes and wires were removed per
protocol. Arrangements were made for follow up appointments and
medications were as noted.  She was discharged to home on
post-operative day six.
