CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Please eval for interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
36 year old man found unresponsive after drug ingestion.
Intubated.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for interval change
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Patient found unresponsive after drug
ingestion.

Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.

Patient has been extubated. Cardiomediastinal contour is normal.
There has been almost complete resolution of the opacities
described in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe, a faint
opacity remains in the left upper lobe, there is no pneumothorax
or sizable pleural effusions. Note is made that the left lateral
CP angle was not included on the film.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-12-6**] 3:36 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Evaluate ETT placement, evaluate for intrathoracic
pathology

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
36 year old man found unresponsive after drug ingestion.
Intubated en route to hospital.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate ETT placement, evaluate for intrathoracic pathology.
HISTORY: Drug OD status post intubation.

No prior comparison exams are available.

SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH

FINDINGS: Ill-defined opacity is noted in the retrocardiac
region, causing slight obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, as
well as the left upper lung zone. Remaining lungs appear clear
with overall exam somewhat limited due to low lung volumes. The
hilar contours appear slightly prominent, likely related to low
lung volumes and bedside technique. No evidence of pneumothorax,
pulmonary edema, or large effusion. Endotracheal tube terminates
4.5 cm from the carina and orogastric tube tip can be traced as
distal as the gastroesophageal junction.

IMPRESSION:
1. Retrocardiac consolidation with air bronchograms, and
probable left upper zone opacity. Likely infectious, and
aspiration-related. Radiographic followup is recommended.

2. Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube. Nasogastric tube
appears to terminate at the GE junction. Advancement is
recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
#Clonidine Overdose: Patient reportedly ingested 30-50 pills of
Clonidine and 20 pills of SOMA.  The patient was initially given
Charcoal in the ED and received Atropine for bradycardia.  He
was intubated for airway protection.   Clonidine overdose may
cause hypertension and bradycardia followed by hypotension, thus
an A-line was placed for BP monitoring.  Poison
control/toxicology was consulted.  He had an episode of HTN and
bradycardia thought to be secondary to rebound from teh
Clonidine.  He was given hydralazine for BP control given his
reflex hypertension.  Atropine was at the beside given his
reflex bradycardia but was not used (HR was 30's to 40's
initially). On day 2 in the MICU his BP normalized and his HR
increased to the 50'[**05**] range.  The patient was subsequently felt
to be stable and transferred to the floor.  On the floor, the
patients vitals remained stable. A repeat EKG did not show any
changes. No further intervention was needed at that point.
.
#Leukocytosis-Originally thought to be secondary to a stress
reaction after the overdose. A CXR and U/A did not show any
evidence of infection. WBC improved on its own. No further
intervention taken.
.
#Suicide attempt/depression: Patient was evaluated by psychiatry
and social work.  A formal psychiatric diagnosis was not made
and pharmacologic agents were not started given the above
overdose. Pt had 2 Code purples on [**12-10**] for extreme agitation
and violent behavior. He was upset because he was not allowed to
smoke, and subsequently broke the end of the bed by kicing it as
well as taking a butter knife and cutting up the mattress.  He
received PO Zyprexa and Ativan in response to this episode. In
adiiton, after this initial incident, he was asked not to leave
his room which further agitated him. He then threw the phone at
the wall and was threatening to all those who came in the room.
He broke a second bed by kicking the end off.  Security was
called during both incidents.  After the 2nd incident, he was
ordered for 24 hour security monitoring and started in Zyprexa
2.5mg TID per psychiatry recommendations.   He was ordered for a
safe tray, all objects were removed from his room that could be
harmful, and he had zyprexa and ativan for any further
agitation. Pt was discharged directly to an inpatient
psychiatric unit for further care.   Of note, just before time
of discharge patient was found to be tachycardic to the 120s and
pt was getting increasingly agitated and frustrated with staff
and with discharge procedures. He subsequently attempted to
punch a security officer. After discussing with psychiatry,
patient calmed down and received PO zyprexa and Ativan before
leaving.
.
#Asthma: Patient was continued on his home inhalers prn.
.
#HTN: Pt was taken off his home CLonidine medication given the
overdose.  His BP remained stable once on the floor.  The
medication was not resumed on discharge because it was felt
medically unnecessary. .
.
#DM2: Patient was recently diagnosed with DM and is currently
diet controlled at home.  He was monitored with finger sticks
QID and an insulin sliding scale was in place. He
