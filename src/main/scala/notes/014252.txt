ETOH and quit tobacco four to five years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs reveal pulse
119, blood pressure 170/77, respiratory rate 33, pulse
oximetry 100% on nebulizer mask.  In general, the patient is
dyspneic, using accessory muscles.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination - Mucous membranes are dry.  The neck
examination is supple.  Cardiovascular is tachycardia with no
murmurs.  The lung examination revealed prolonged expiratory
with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.  Abdominal
examination is obese, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

times three, cooperative, 5/5 strength in all four
extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, laboratory values were
significant for a white count of 13.8 with a 71.4 polys, no
bands, 22.1 lymphocytes.  Arterial blood gases on admission
was 7.29, with a pCO2 of 66 and a pO2 of 170 on face mask.

Chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence of pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management.  She was
intubated on the third hospital day due to increasing pCO2.
She was a slow wean from the ventilator, remaining intubated
for eleven days.  In the interim, she was started on Levaquin
for a presumed development of pneumonia.  She was also started on
a course of Ampicillin for a Enterococcal urinary tract infection
which was diagnosed during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.

She was successfully extubated on the thirteenth hospital day
and transferred to the floor.  Upon arrival to the floor, she
maintained adequate saturation on nasal cannula and later in
room air.  However, it was noted status post extubation that
the patient had profound upper and lower extremity weakness. Her
weakness was presumed to be secondary to steroid myopathy.  She
did receive propofol and high dose course of intravenous Solu-
Medrol upon admission which was tapered down to a course of
Prednisone 30 mg q.d. with plan for taper upon discharge.

Despite the strong suspicion for steroid myopathy, a neurology
consultation was called to rule out any more dangerous causes of
her extremity weakness. An EMG was done which showed only diffuse
myopathy and no evidence of denervation.  Magnetic resonance scan
of the cervical and high thoracic spine showed chronic changes
consistent with cervical spondylosis as well as a shallow disc
protrusion and multiple foraminal narrowing.

She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on the
twentieth hospital day, [**2157-9-28**].

rehabilitation in stable condition.
