Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**]
Chief Complaint:
pelvic mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, tumor debulking, omentectomy, extended
right colectomy, right pelvic peritoneal implant excision,
partial wedge gastrectomy, ileal descending colostomy, and rigid
proctosigmoidoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70-year-old G2, P2 sent by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for
consultation regarding a possible diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
The patient presented with a several month history of increasing
abdominal distention, diffuse abdominal discomfort, and
exacerbation of heartburn symptoms. She was evaluated with an
upper endoscopy on [**2106-8-27**], at which time a submucosal mass in
the stomach was noted. No biopsy was obtained. She then had a CT
angiography of the abdomen and a CT of the pelvis on [**2106-10-8**].
This revealed the surface of the liver to be studded with
multiple discrete enhancing nodules. There were also nodules in
the region of the fissure for the ligamentum venosum and
ligamentum teres. The pancreas was normal. There was
disseminated peritoneal carcinomatosis, with large omental cakes
seen along the right flank.  There was a small amount of
perihepatic ascites. Discrete nodules were identified studding
the surface the liver as previously described, as well as the
surface of the spleen and stomach. There was no significant
retroperitoneal adenopathy. In the pelvis, there was some
suggestion of uterine and bilateral adnexal masses. Given the
nonspecific nature of these findings, a CT guided omental biopsy
was performed on [**2106-10-13**]. This revealed high-grade papillary
carcinoma, consistent with ovarian origin. The patient states
that she has had increasing abdominal girth and has difficulty
fitting into her clothes. She has had about a 12 pound
unintentional weight loss. She has some shortness of breath,
which she attributes to the increasing abdominal distention. She
has diffuse but low-grade abdominal discomfort.


Past Medical History:
GERD and hypothyroidism.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Rotator cuff repair and cholecystectomy.
OB HISTORY:  Vaginal delivery x2.
GYN HISTORY:  Last Pap smear and mammogram were both recently
normal.


Social History:
The patient does not smoke or drink.

Family History:
Significant for mother with stomach cancer, a brother with
pancreatic cancer, cousin with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and aunts with
stomach cancer.


Physical Exam:
GENERAL:  Well developed and moderately overweight.
HEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.
LYMPHATICS:  Lymph node survey was negative.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular without murmurs.
BREASTS:  Without masses.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and moderately distended.  There was no
appreciable ascites.  There was a palpable mass extending along
the entire right side of the abdomen.  This was quite firm.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
PELVIC:  The vulva and vagina were normal.  The cervix was
normal.  Bimanual and rectovaginal examination was limited by
body habitus.  No definite pelvic masses were appreciated.
There was no definite cul-de-sac nodularity and the rectal was
intrinsically normal.


Pertinent Results:
[**11-22**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small-bowel obstruction with candidate transition point in
LLQ
2. Large left pleural effusion with associated compressive
atelectasis.
3. Overall, slight improvement in carcinomatosis and malignant
ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2106-11-2**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, total
abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, tumor
debulking, omentectomy, extended right colectomy, right pelvic
peritoneal implant excision, partial wedge gastrectomy, ileal
descending colostomy, and rigid proctosigmoidoscopy, requiring 4
units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
Post-operatively, she remained intubated and was transferred to
the SICU, with transfer to regular post-operative floor on
POD#2.
.
The patient's post-operative course was complicated by low
hematocrit, post-operative fever w/ Clostridium perfringens on
blood culture, an intrahepatic IVC thrombus, bilateral upper
lobe opacities and bibasilar effusions L>R with dyspnea/hypoxia
and O2 requirement, lower extremity fungal infection, and small
bowel obstruction.
.
1) Heme:
The pt's low hematocrit stabilized after 2 additional
transfusions of 2 units PRBC's each, and was thought to be
dilutional gvien a fluid excess of 12L.  Hcts subsequently
remained stable at ~27, and she had no evidence of bleeding. On
POD #6, the patient underwent a CT of the abdomen for evaluation
of fever, and an intrahepatic IVC thrombus was discovered
incidentally.  Per surgery recommendation the patient was
started on heparin for anticoagulation, however this was
discontinued when the pt had another Hct drop.  Vascular surgery
recommended no further anticoagulation, and given the location
of the thrombus, filter placement was also not technically
feasible. On repeat CT scan [**11-22**], the thrombus was not
visualized.
.
2) ID: The pt had post-operative fevers, for which blood
cultures were obtained.  1 of 2 bottles from [**11-4**] was positive
for c. perfringens. Infectious disease was consulted and she was
started on vancomycin empirically, with ampicillin-sulbactam
added after identification and sensitivities. Other cultures
from [**11-5**], 13, 14, 15 all showed no growth, therefore the c.
perfringens was thought to be a contaminant.  On POD#4, the pt
continued to require 4 L of oxygen by NC. She underwent a CTA of
the chest which showed no pulmonary emboli but did show
bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia. She was
started on levofloxacin, and repeat chest x-ray showed that her
pneumonia improved after 4 days of levofloxacin, and this was
discontinued. Given continued temperatures, CTs of the abdomen
were obtained [**11-8**], [**11-12**] which showed increasing
carcinomatosis and multiple pelvic pockets of free fluid, some
loculated, which were thought to be malignant ascites; none
amenable to percutaneous drainage.  The pt remained afebrile on
Vanco/Zosyn from [**11-11**], with decreasing WBC, and V/Z were
discontinued on [**11-23**].  The patient was also noted to have a
bilateral lower extremity and groin rash on [**11-23**]; ID consult
was obtained, and it was felt that this was the result of a
fungal infection, and IV fluconazole was started.  The rash
improved on fluconazole, and the patient was switched to PO
fluconazole on [**12-2**], to continue for a 6 week total course.
.
3) Pulm:
In addition to the presumed pneumonia as above, the pt continued
to have subjective dyspnea and O2 requirement.  Repeat CTA [**11-12**]
was again negative for PE.  CXR's and CTs showed bibasilar
effusions, L>R.  An interventional pulm consult was obtained for
possible thoracentesis, but per bedside U/S, the left effusion
was found to be subpulmonic and quite small, and therefore not
likely to account for pt's symptoms; given the location,
thoracentesis would also be at higher risk for adverse events
i.e. PTX, bleeding, per IP.  The patient's hypoxia and shortness
of breath resolved spontaneously, and for the last week of
admission she was 96-100% on RA.
.
3) FEN/GI:
Given nausea and poor po intake, the pt was started on TPN, with
diet slowly advanced.  However, on CT scan [**11-22**], the patient
was noted to have a small bowel obstruction, associated with
some nausea and vomiting.  She was made NPO until passing flatus
and subjective resolution of nausea, and was advanced to clears
[**11-29**], then regular [**12-1**].  As she was tolerating regular PO
without nausea, her TPN was d/c'd [**12-2**].
.
4) Endocrine:
The patient's Levoxyl was briefly increased to 200 mcg qd, but
this was decreased to 150 mcg [**11-17**].  She was covered for
somewhat elevated FSG's with an insu
