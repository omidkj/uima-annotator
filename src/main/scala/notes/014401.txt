History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89411**] is a 55-year-old male with PMHx significant for CHF,
recurrent PNA, rectal CA with colostomy in place, seizure d/o,
MDD, MR, COPD, cirrhosis, schizophrenia and glaucoma who
presented to OSH with hypoglycemia, altered mental status and
respiratory distress. Patient was noted to be obtunded at [**Hospital **]
nursing home this morning; fingerstick glucose 40. Got D50 and
EMS was called; EMTs noted respiratory distress and he was taken
to an OSH where CXR showed pulmonary edema and possible
pneumonia. He was also noted to have a valproate level of 95
(upper limit of normal for that assay: 20) and ammonia 214.
Patient continued to have respiratory distress so he was
intubated and started on ceftriaxone & azithromycin empirically
for PNA. Received nitroglycerin and lasix 20mg IV with increase
in UOP. Given respiratory status and concern for valproic acid
overdose, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. En route to [**Hospital1 18**], he became hypotensive to SBP 80s
and was started on levophed. Pressors were stopped on arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] (and patient has remained off of pressors with SBPs
110s-130s).



VS on arrival to the ED were [**Age over 90 **]F 68 133/69 16 100% FiO2 100%.
FAST exam negative; bedside cardiac ultrasound showed
hypokinesis with poor contractility, no IVC collapse. Troponin
<0.01 x 1. CXR showed pulmonary edema and patchy opacities
concerning for PNA. RIJ placed and patient got a dose of
vancomycin for empiric HCAP coverage (lives in nursing home).
BNP elevated at [**2189**] and U/A positive for UTI. Given concern for
valproate level at OSH (95, normal range 50-100), toxicology was
consulted; however, his repeat valproate level was 72, which is
within normal range of 50-100 for our lab. Patient received 1
dose of multidose activated charcoal as well as L-carnitine 5
grams via NGT (maximum dose 6g/day) and was admitted to the MICU
for further management of respiratory failure.

Microbiology:
[**8-13**] Urine: 10,000-100,000 of Klebsiella, pan-sensitive except
nitrofurantoin
[**8-13**] Blood Cx: still pending as of [**2179-8-18**]
[**8-14**] MRSA screen: negative
[**8-14**] and [**8-15**] C-dif toxin: negative
[**8-14**] Catheter tip IV: negative
[**8-14**] sputum: GPC's in pairs and clusters on gram stain; Cx showed
sparse pan-sensitive pseudomonas
.
Imaging:
[**8-14**] Transthoracic echo: The left atrium is elongated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is near-hyperdynamic (LVEF
70-75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Near-hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic
function. No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant
valvular disease seen.
.
[**8-14**] CT Head w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial
process.
.
[**8-17**] CXR: Substantial left lower [**Month/Day (1) 3630**] atelectasis which worsened
appreciably between [**8-13**] and [**8-14**] has continued to progress,
now accompanied by moderate left pleural effusion which may be
responsible for a new bulging contour in the mediastinum in the
region of the aortopulmonic window. There is also new
substantial right lower [**Month (only) 3630**] atelectasis. ET tube is in standard
placement.  Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
view. No pneumothorax.  Right internal jugular line ends in the
mid SVC.
.
[**8-19**] CXR: Mild resolution in the rigth lower [**Month/Day (4) 3630**]
atelectasis/consolidation, left basal atelectasis and bilateral
pleural
effusion.
.
[**8-25**] CXR (12pm - discussed with radiologist, report not
available): Increased opacity in left lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent
an aspiration pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
[**8-25**] CXR (3pm - disucssed with radiologist, report no
available): Taken after pt had chest PT, somewhat improved
opacity in left lower [**Month/Year (2) 3630**], new opacity still present compared
to [**8-19**] CXR.  No pneumothorax, no pleural effusion.
