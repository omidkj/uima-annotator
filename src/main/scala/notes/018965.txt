Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p VF arrest and cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with no intervention
Cardioversion
Pulmonary Intubation


History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with history of CAD s/p PCI (DES) to LAD at [**Hospital 12017**]
Hospital in [**2156**], HTN, HL, PVD s/p aorto-femoral bypass (?[**2152**]
at [**Hospital3 **]) and COPD currently smoking who is being
transferred from [**Hospital6 19155**] with cardiogenic
shock after VF arrest and suspected cardiogenic shock.  Patient
stopped his ASA and clopidogrel on [**Hospital6 2974**] (6 days ago) as he was
instructed for rectal sphincterectomy/fissure repair which he
underwent on [**2163-12-14**].  While in the day surgery recovery room he
began having burning CP, EKG done at the time showed inverted T
waves (per report, no EKG evidence). The pt
hospitalist/intensivist was called and while evaluating the
patient went into Vfib arrest and was pulseless for 20 minutes,
defibrillated x5, given epi and amiodarone with ROSC. After this
he was reported to have regained intermittent conciousness and
was transferred to the ICU where he was given amiodarone (with
bolus), heparin gtt, clopidogrel, ASA, lidocaine gtt (with
bolus) and intubated. EKG then showed Q waves in leads V1 and V2
and 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1 and V2, hyperacute T waves in
V3-V6 and ~[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in I and II, and cardiac enzymes
showed CK of 4270, CKMB of 610 and Tn-XX of 136.  He was
stabilized overninght and EKG on [**2162-12-15**] showed Q waves in
V1-V5.
Labs at that time showed: CKMB >306 [**12-15**], ABG on vent -
7.32/45/148/23, CK 4270
CKmb 610, tropI 136, WBC of 15.1 with 83% PMNs. UA suggested
possible UTI. At this point the decision was made to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management. cxr showed that the ET tube may be
into right mainstem bronchus, there is whiteout of the left side
per report. There are conflicting stories regarding neurologic
function - OSH states he did not recover any function but flight
med techs state he was gagging on the tube and did reach his
hand up at one point. Of note, pt's last echo in [**2161**] showed
normal LV function and mild tricuspid regurg.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECG [**2163-12-15**]
Sinus rhythm. Anteroseptal myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. No
previous tracing available for comparison
.
TTE: [**2163-12-15**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
anteroseptal segments, apical walls (with relative preservation
of the apical inferior segment), and true apex
(?near-aneurysmal). Hypokinesis of the basal and mid
inferoseptal, anterior and anterolateral walls. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severely depresssed left ventricular systolic
function with regional wall motion abnormalities as described
above. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. EF >
15-20%
.
CXR [**2163-12-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube is too low and at the level of the carina
pointing
towards the main stem bronchus.
2. Right internal jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC. No
pneumothorax.
3. Left basilar hazy opacification is likely atelectasis,
although early
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
[**2163-12-16**] CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-15**], the endotracheal
tube has
been removed. The patient has taken a much better inspiration.

enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with probable worsening of
