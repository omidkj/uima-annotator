Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain,
chest pain, and EKG changes.  While you were here, your blood
pressure was low, so you received IV fluids and one unit of
blood, and were transferred to the ICU temporarily for
observation.  Blood tests and more EKGs of your heart were
reassuring.

You should follow up with your primary card doctor, your
cardiologist, and a gastroenterologist.  We have made
appointments for you, please see below.

Quitting smoking would greatly improve your health.  Please
discuss strategies for quitting with your PCP.
