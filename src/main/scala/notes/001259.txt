History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with history of Atrial fibrillation who has been
followed with serial echocardiograms for her known aortic
stenosis over the past couple of years. Pt
has been experiencing worsening shortness of breath and
exertional chest pain.  Most recent echo in [**Month (only) **] of this year
revealed significant aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] 0.7cm2,
[**1-10**]+MR/TR, mild pulmonary HTN and a normal EF. She now presents
for surgical evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-10-27**] Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no obstructive coronary artery disease. The LMCA was normal. The
LAD and
LCX had minor luminal irregularities. The RCA had no
angiographically
apparent stenoses.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 178/74 mm Hg.

[**2155-10-27**] Carotid Ultrasound
No plaque or hemodynamically significant stenoses.

[**2155-10-27**] Femoral Ultrasound
1. 1 cm pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral
artery. No AV
fistula identified.
2. Widely patent right femoral artery and common femoral vein.

[**2155-10-28**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function remains normal. There is a well
seated bioprosthesis in the aortic position. No AI is visualized
but echo windows are limited. The MR is now mild. TR remains
unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9250**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2155-10-27**] for surgical
management of her aortic stenosis. As she had been off her
coumadin for 5 days prior to admission, she was placed on
heparin for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation. She
underwent a cardiac catheterization in preparation for surgery
which revealed clean coronaries. A carotid duplex ultrasound was
performed which showed no significant internal carotid artery
stenosis. As she had a large hematoma from her cardiac
catheterization, and ultrasound was performed which showed 1 cm
pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral artery, no
AV fistula identified and a widely patent right femoral artery
and common femoral vein. On [**2155-10-28**], she was taken to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement
using a 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue valve. Please see operative note
for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, she had awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She was weaned from her
pressors and transferred to the step down floor.  Her chest
tubes and wires were removed and her coumadin was restarted.
She was diuresed toward her pre-operative weight of 180 lbs.
Her oral intake was bolstered by ensure shakes.  She was seen by
physical therapy and it was determined that she would benefit
from going to rehab at discharge.  By post-operative day four
she was ready for discharge to rehab.
