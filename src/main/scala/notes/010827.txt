HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 19484**] is an 89 Greek woman
who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department with a one day history of nausea,
vomiting, dizziness and headaches since the morning of her
presentation.  At that time she was on Coumadin for a prior
history of atrial fibrillation.  Head CT performed in the
Emergency Department was positive for acute right cerebellar
bleed.  The patient's status at that time showed her to be
able to protect her own airway and she was chosen not to be
intubated.  She was given fresh frozen platelets and IM
vitamin K to reverse INR of 2.3 and was admitted to the
Neurosurgical Service for ongoing management and treatment of
her cerebellar bleed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history
notable for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation,
congestive heart failure, hypertension, diverticulitis and
gout.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post coronary
stent placement.

MEDICATIONS ON PRESENTATION:
1.  Coumadin.
2.  Digoxin.
3.  Accupril.
4.  Lopresor.
5.  Colchicine.
6.  Allopurinol.
7.  Imdur.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was noted
to be a healthy appearing elderly woman in no acute distress.
HEENT examination showed pupils are equal, round and reactive
to light.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  She
showed normal extraocular movements.  Upper extremity
strength was equal bilaterally.  Lower extremity strength was
equal bilaterally.  Cardiac examination showed regular rate
and rhythm.  No evidence of murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination showed abdomen soft, nontender,
positive bowel sounds.

LABORATORY TESTS ON PRESENTATION TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:
hematocrit 45.6, platelets 203, white blood cell count of
10.9.  Chem 7 sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 101, CO2
23, BUN 20, creatinine .7, glucose 192.  Digoxin level was
0.7.  Coagulation studies showed a PT of 18.6, PTT 27.8 and
an INR of 2.3.  Noncontrast head CT performed in the
Emergency Department showed a right cerebellar bleed.  No
evidence of any mass effect, nor midline shift.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the night of [**8-3**] the patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for observation and
management of her cerebellar bleed.  On the floor the patient
maintained a study progress and returned for neurological
function.  She remained awake, alert and oriented at all
times.  Through a translator she was able to prove that she
was oriented to person, place and time.  Repeat CT scans on
[**8-4**] showed no progression of the cerebellar bleed.  On
[**2122-8-5**] the patient's neurological examination had continued
to improve and stabilize.  She had been weaned off of all
intravenous medications and arrangements were made for
transfer to the Far Five Inpatient Unit.  A final interval CT
was performed on [**2122-8-7**].  That CT in comparison to the CT
performed on [**8-3**] showed no evidence of interval change,
additional bleeding, or tentorial herniation.  On [**2122-8-8**] following clearance from physical therapy and
occupational therapy, the patient was deemed as being
suitable for discharge to home with appropriate home
services.  She was discharged in the care of her family.
