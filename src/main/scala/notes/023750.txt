Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Pre-syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2185-4-18**] 1. Re-do sternotomy. 2. Aortic valve replacement with a
size 23-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic tissue valve.


History of Present Illness:
87M with AS s/p valvuloplasty x3 most recet of which was in
[**1-/2185**], MVP, CABG x 6 vessel (remote), bradycardia s/p dual
ICD/pacer, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45%, now presenting
with 3 day history worsening shortness of breath.
The patient reports he developed dyspnea on exertion last week
which progressively became worse. He reports he was getting out
of bed and developed a hot flash and became short of breath as
he was getting up, then felt dyspneic as he was walking to the
bathroom. This was almost identical to the syncopal episode he
had that led to his valvulopsty in 12/[**2184**]. He denies chest
pain, shortness of breath at rest, lightheadedness, dizziness,
nausea/vomiting.
The patient reported to [**Hospital 6930**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital in NH for the
dyspnea on exertion and was found there to have guiac posistive
stool (he's on iron supplements), anemia (at his baseline), and
increased weakness. He remained chest-pain free and did not
report changes in dyspnea. The patient denies abdominal pain,
hematemesis, changes in his bowel movements, but does report
black stool due to iron supplements he takes every morning.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were: 97.6 62
122/68 18 98% 2L NC. The patient had a CXR which was clear, and
had a stool guiac which was brown and faintly positive. Cr was
1.4 from baseline 1.1, BNP 6985, CE's neg x1.
The patient has had a remote h/o DVT, so underwent a CTA to r/o
PE which was negative.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is probably severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2) but Doppler recordings
are technically suboptimal. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe ([**4-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-1-27**],
the prior study was of better technical quality. Mitral
regurgitation is now more prominent.
.
CTA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Small right greater than left pleural effusions.
3. Moderate to severe emphysema.
.
ECHO [**2185-4-13**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with septal hypokinesis. Diastolic function could
not be assessed. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-4-8**],
Doppler velocities across the aortic valve can be more clearly
seen on the current study. The valve is severely stenotic. The
degree of mitral regurgitation appears moderate on the current
study (although may be UNDERestimated due to acoustic
shadowing). It was probably moderate on the prior study also.
Pulmonary artery pressures can be estimated on the current study
and are moderately elevated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2185-4-7**] for further
work-up of his dyspnea. A CT scan was negative for a pulmonary
embolism. An echocardiogram showed severe aortic valve stenosis.
Given the severity fo his disease, the cardiac surgery service
was consulted for surgical evaluation. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. Carotid ultrasound showed a less
then 40% bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. Vein
mapping showed small but usuable vein in his right leg. Cardiac
catheterization revealed patent grafts from his previous surgery
with native three vessel disease and severe aortic valve
stenosis. He had visual changes following his catheterization
and a CTA was performed which was negative for any acute
abnormality. As he was previously on coumadin for a pulmonary
embolism many years ago, in discussion with his primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was discontinued. On [**2185-4-18**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken
to the operating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with
and aortic valve replacement. Please see operative note for
surgical details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. The electrophysiology
service interogated his AICD/Pacemaker. No adjustments were made
and it was functioning well with good battery life. Beta
blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed. On postoperative
day two, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy servic
