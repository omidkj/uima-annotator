Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
massive hemoptysis, OSH transfer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchial artery embolization x 2
intubation
central line placement
arterial line placement
multiple bronchoscopies, flex and rigid

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16590**] is a 79 yo male with severe copd, who has been in
[**Hospital 16843**] Hospital for the past 12 days getting treatment with
steroids for a COPD flare after presenting with SOB and yellow
sputum production, SOB, wheezing, and chest tightness, now being
transferred for management of hemoptysis. He was started on IV
steroids (40 to 80mg during his OSH stay), nebs, and antibiotics
(vanc/zosyn initially). He was started on fondaparinux for
history of HIT. He was also diuresed. He has a very slow course
of improvement and actually worsened in terms of his dyspnea in
the past few days. His steroids were increased.
.
24 hrs prior to transfer, Mr. [**Known lastname 16590**] developed hemoptysis,
initially mild, but then more significant. He was transferred to
the ICU and intubated for bronchoscopy, which he underwent on
the morning of transfer. Significant bleeding was found from the
posterior segment of the RUL, though there was no endobronchial
lesion identified. Epinephrine and saline irrigation was not
successful successful in controlling the bleeding, however it
subsequently bleeding improved prior to transfer. His HCT was
reported as stable at 35.9 on the day of transfer and he has not
required transfusion. He is stable on PRVC TV 450, PEEP 5, FiO2
80%, RR 14. He was also placed got vancomycin for MRSA found in
a [**6-29**] sputum culture. BCx have been negative and he has been
afebrile. Before the bronch, his WBC was 18-21, afterwards it
was 31, in the setting of steroids. His CXR shows an infiltrate
on RUL.
.
.
On the floor, he is intubated. He opens eyes to voice and
responds to simple commands.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2170-7-4**] 10:51 PM
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. NG tube tip is 8 cm
above the
carina. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Of note the lungs
were not
totally included in the radiograph. In the visualized portions
of the lungs
radiolucency of the left upper lobe is due to emphysema. Large
right mid lung
opacity could be hemorrhage or pneumonia. There is interstitial
bilateral
basal opacities larger on the right side.
.
ECHO
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Overall borderline normal
left ventricular systolic function. Right ventricular
hypertrophy, dilation, at least moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
CT-A CHEST:
MPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental levels.
Small area
of outpouching of contrast, immediately adjacent to
atherosclerotic plaque is
seen in the descending aorta, most likely representing an area
of penetrating
atherosclerotic ulceration, unchanged since [**2170-6-29**].

2. Significant progression of infectious process, now with
extensive airspace
consolidation involving the entire right hemithorax with
multiple air-fluid
levels, most compatible with a component of necrotizing
pneumonia in addition
to severe emphysema.

3. Likely aspiration/hemorrhage or secretions within the right
lower lobe
bronchi with associated atelectasis.
.
CXR [**7-8**]
omparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier.


New opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent with
aspiration. Dense
consolidations in the right mid and opacities in the right lower
lobe are
unchanged. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. NG
tube tip is
out of view below the diaphragm.

ET tube tips are in the carina and left main bronchus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16590**] was transferred from an OSH with massive hemoptysis
and MRSA PNA. He was intubated prior to transfer. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], he was sent urgently to IR for angioembolization of his
bronchial artery. This was successful. He then went to the OR
for rigid bronchoscopy and washout of the R lung, which was
filled with blood. CT-A was negative for PE, but confirmed
necrotizing PNA, c/w his known MRSA infection. Over the next
several days, he remained intubated with extremely poor
