History of Present Illness:
This 84 yo woman with a PMH of metastatic renal Cell Ca,
dementia, HTN, developed a fever of 101 today at [**Last Name (un) 1188**] house,
with hypoxia, cough and abdominal pain. She had poor appetitie
today. VS were BP 109/66- HR 112- RR 32 with O2 sats of 91% on 2
l/min. Abdomen was generally tender. Stool was guaiac neg. She
was uncomfortable and restless. Per HCP, patient has had URI
symptoms over the past two weeks. She is DNR/DNI and was at home
with hospice. She was recently transferred to [**Last Name (un) 1188**] house
secondary to declining mental status, and was continuing with
hospice care there as well. The patient wears 2L NC at home at
baseline.
.
On presentation to the ED the patient was hypotensive with SBPs
in 80-90s. Her O2 sat was 93% on 4L NC. Rectal temp was 103. WBC
32.0, lactate 5.7, Cr 2.7. CXR and CT torso showed multifocal
pneumonia, without intrabdominal pathology. She was given
vancomycin, zosyn, and 3L NS. Her BP increased to 104/49, with
HR in 90's, RR 30 98% on NRB. The patient was more responsive
prior to transfer.
.
On presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the HCP decided that she believed the
patient would not want to have aggressive care, including
central line placement or pressors. She agreed to continuing
with IVF resuscitation and antibiotics. Mot importantly, she
wanted to keep the patient comfortable

Imaging/results:
CXR [**3-4**]: pulm edema, bibasilar opacification c/w PNA
.
CXR [**3-7**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-4**], there is
persistent bibasilar opacifications. Although this could merely
reflect atelectasis and effusion, the possibility of
superimposed pneumonia should be seriously considered in view of
the clinical symptoms
.
.
CT c/a/p: b/l pulm nodules with med/hilar LAD c/w metastatic dz,
bibasilar consolidations and effusions, gallbladder is markedly
distended, but there is no pericholecystic fat stranding or
cholelithiasis, R adrenal nodule susp for metastases, R inguinal
fat containing hernia


Brief Hospital Course:
85year old female with h/o metastatic RCC (lung mets), remote L
nephrectomy, ?CKD, HTN, hypothyroid, who is currently enrolled
in hospice and residing at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] prsented to ED on [**3-4**]
with hypoxia/fever/cough/abdominal pain, found to be hypotensive
with severe sepsis (temp 103, SBP 80, lactate 5.7, creat 2.7)
with imaging revealing bibasilar PNA.  Recieved vanc/zosyn, 3L
IVFs and transfered to MICU. After discussion with HCP, it was
decided not to escalate care with placement of central line or
pressors, okay to continue supportive care with fluids,
antibiotics and oxygen, and low threshold to shift goals of care
to CMO. In ICU, got more IVFs, vanc/zosyn continued. She
appeared to stabilize with improved BP and urine outpt and was
transfered to Gen Med [**3-6**] for further management. Blood cultures
eventually grew out strep pneumonia and [**Month/Day (4) **] changed to
ceftriaxone 1g q24 (PICC placed) for plan 2week treatment given
bacteremia.
.
see progress note for details:
.
.
Severe Sepsis, strep PNA with bacteremia: WBC 30s, hypotension,
hypoxic, lactic acidosis, ?ARF->severe sepsis, s/p approx 5L
IVFs, now HDS. With Strep Pneumonia bibasilar PNA and bacteremia
(2 sets on [**2-20**] blood cx pending).  Has Abd pain but CT
unremarkable. s/p Vanc/Zosyn X3days, changed to ceftriaxone 1g
q24 with plan for total 14day coruse, PICC placed today.
Currently on 3L O2. Goal per HCP is for supportive care with [**Name (NI) **]
and fluids but no aggressive measures.
If pt appears dyspneic, give morphine, liberalize O2, overall
goal for comfort precedes treatment.
.
.
Abdominal Pain/constipation: Abd tenderness on exam. CT w/o any
acute abnormalities other than GB dilation w/o evidence of
cholecysitis and fat containing inguinal hernia that doesnt
appear incarcerated. Most likely [**1-31**] constipation and finally
had BM today after enema. Cont aggressive bowel regimen with
enema, laxatives, balance narcotics for pain control with
worsening constipation
.
.
Acute Renal failure +/- CKD IV: unsure baseline creatinine. s/p
L nephrectomy [**2071**] so likely has some CKD. Creat 2.5-2.7 while
here, no improvement despite IVFs. Rising BUN and hypernatremia
suggests  volume depletion but crackles on exam, on lasix as
outpt, and BNP 15K, not sure if carries diagnosis of heart
failure. Given very low PO intake and clinically appears dry,
will give 500cc more IVFs and hold lasix for a couple days. Can
resume at [**Hospital1 1501**] if pt requiring more O2 or more resp distress.
.
.
Renal cell Carcinoma, metastatic: known lung nodules, ?adrenal
nodule. Enrolled in hospice. On Morphine for pain symptoms,
complicated by constipation despite aggressive bowel regimen
Continue with pain regimen with morphine IR 15mg [**Hospital1 **], 5mg PO prn
breakthrough and 1-2mg IV prn if not taking PO, bowel regimen
with colace/senna/MOM/lactulose/enema. When awake, resume diet
with aspiration precautions, megace
.
.
Hypertension: Resume lisinopril and atenolol, hold lasix for a
couple of days
.
.
Pulm Edema: Unclear if has h/o heart failure (on lasix as
outpt), CXR with pulm edema here and BNP 15K. Clinically appears
dry and BUN rising/hypernatremia suggesting dehydration (unless
this is decompensated heart failure with decreased forward
will not repeat one here at this time.  Resume lasix in a couple
days or sooner if pt appears dyspneic or increased O2
requirements.
.
.
Depression: resume celexa 20
.
.
Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine PO
.
.
FEN/proph: HLIV, small fluid boluses prn hypotension, general
diet when awake, TEDs, heparin, aggressive bowel regimen
.
.
Dispo/Code:  DNR/I. condition critical/guarded. Plan for 14days
ceftriaxone via PICC. [**Hospital **] hospice care on discharge.
On conversation with HCP, no further escalation of care and low
threshold to shift goals of care to CMO
