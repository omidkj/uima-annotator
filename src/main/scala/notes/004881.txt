[**2130-9-11**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
co-dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery
disease. The RCA has a 70% ostial stenosis. The LAD has a 70%
mid vessel stenosis. The LMCA is non-obstructed. The LCx is
co-dominant and non-obstructed. 2. Resting hemodynamic
measurement demonstrated elevated left and right sided filling
pressures with an LVEDP of 26 mmHg and RVEDP of 16 mmHg. The
mean PCWP was elevated at 23 mmHg. The mean PA pressure was
moderately elevated at 42 mmHg. The systemic arterial pressure
was significantly elevated at 187/88 mmHg. 3. The mean gradient
across the aortic valve was determined to be 30 mmHg. The
calculated Fick C.I. was at the lower limits of normal at 2.4
L/min/m2. The [**Location (un) 109**] was calculated to be 0.84 cm2.
[**2130-9-12**] Carotid Ultrasound: 1. There is less than 40% stenosis
within the right internal carotid artery. 2. There is 60-69%
stenosis within the left internal carotid artery.
[**2130-9-12**] Echocardiogram: The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2130-9-18**]
There has been previous median sternotomy and aortic valve
replacement. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable on
the left in the postoperative period. There is apparent widening
of the right cardiac contour. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
Improving atelectasis and diffusions are present bilaterally at
the bases. On the lateral view, an air-fluid level is present in
the upper retrosternal region.
IMPRESSION:
1. Widening of right cardiac contour, which could be due to
loculated pericardial fluid or a medially loculated pleural
effusion adjacent to the heart.
2. Retrosternal air-fluid level which may represent either an
anterior loculated hydropneumothorax or a small postoperative
collection.
3. Improving pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1007**] was admitted under cardiology to the CCU. Cardiac
catheterization was performed which showed severe two vessel
coronary artery disease(see result section for cath results).
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was
performed. Repeat echocardiogram confirmed severe aortic
stenosis(see result section for additional ECHO results).  Given
her complete heart block, the arrhythmia service recommended
permanent pacemaker after cardiac surgical intervention. Her
preoperative course was otherwise uneventful. On [**9-14**],
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic valve replacement along with
coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details,
please see seperate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, she was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
She was kept intubated and sedated for placement of permanent
pacemaker on postoperative day one. On postoperative day two,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. She maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day three. Over several days, medical
therapy was optimized and she continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis. Of note, she was maintained on
Aspirin and Plavix secondary to poor distal coronary targets.

She was unable to void after her foley catheter was removed and
the foley was reinserted. She was started on Bactrim, and is to
remain on it while the foley is in secondary to her valve
replacement. She will need urology follow up.

Due to steady progress, she was medically cleared for discharge
to rehab on postoperative day 5.
