Echocardiogram
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**Known lastname **] before bypass

POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.LVEF 50% to 55%.
There is a bioprosthesis in the native aortic position which is
stable and functioning well.
The transaortic gradients are peak 15 and a mean of 8.
Intact thoracic aorta.

Final Report
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.
INDICATION: Female patient with aortic valve replacement and
Talon closure. Evaluate for interval change.
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with
patient in
upright position. Available for comparison is the next preceding
portable
chest examination of [**2100-9-26**]. Moderate cardiac
enlargement remains unchanged. The previously described three
Talon devices that the sternotomy together, remain in unchanged
position. No pneumothorax has developed and no evidence of
increased pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. There is a
slight increase of pleural density on the left base obliterating
mildly the left lateral pleural sinus and a probably atelectatic
density exists in the left lower lobe posterior segment as
identified on the lateral view. Metallic structures of a porcine
aortic valve prosthesis are noted in place. When comparison is
made with the preoperative PA and lateral chest examination of
[**9-20**], heart shadow is larger, but there is no
significantly increased pulmonary vascular congestive pattern.
Plate atelectasis on the lung bases
and some mild-to-moderate pleural effusion on the left base is
noted and
further followup chest examination is recommended.

Approved: TUE [**2100-9-28**] 5:50 PM


Brief Hospital Course:
Same day admision on [**9-24**] for surgery with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. In
summary at that time she had redo sternotomy, aortic valve
replacement and sternal closure with Talon closure device. Her
bypass time was 72 minutes with a crossclamp time of 59 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition. Please see operative report for
details.
Once hemodynamically stable drips were weaned and she was
extubated without difficulty. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
During the immediate post-operative period she had a transient
rise in her creatinine from a baseline of 1.6 to 2.2 which
gradually drifted back to baseline during her stay. She was
transferred to the step down unit for ongoing postoperative care
on POD3. She was gently diuresed toward her preoperative weight
was started on lopressor, norvasc in addition to her preop
Benicar for blood pressure contol. She was slow to advance in
her capacity for physical activity and was transferred to
rehabilitation at Lifecare of [**Location (un) 84492**] on POD 6.
