Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status change

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incision and drainage of right groin abscess

History of Present Illness:
60 YO M w CHF, distant MI, VT s/p pacer/ICD/VT ablation who
presented with cloudy thinking and dizziness for 1 week in the
setting of polydypsia and polyuria.
.
Symptoms started about 1 week prior to presentation the [**Hospital1 18**],
with anorexia and sleeping constantly, followed by incontinence,
weakness, and dizziness. 2 days prior to admission, his wife
noted that he became disoriented, which persisted until the day
of admission, which was Monday evening [**10-30**], when the patient
requested to be taken to the hospital. He was transported by
Ambulance because he felt unable to make it down the stairs with
assistance only from his wife. [**Name (NI) **] never lost consiousness. Of
note, he did not take any of his medications the weekend prior
to admission because he dropped his pill box and his wife did
not know his usual regimen.
.
In the ED, he was noted to have a BS of >800, creat 2.8 (from
1.5) with a gap but no ketones. He was given levaquin and
admitted to the ICU for insulin gtt which was stopped within
24h. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended starting lantus and
humalog. His BS decreased to 100s-200s but then his BS increased
to 300s on MICU day 2, [**11-1**], so his glargine was increased and
his humalog sliding scale was titrated up. His mental status
improved back to his baseline with improvement in his BS.
.
The patient has a known sacral decubitus ulcer, which he has had
for 3 weeks. He had no signs or symptoms of infection per his
wife - no fever, chills, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
dysuria.
.
Never diagnosed with diabetes. Does not take diabetes
medications at home.

Brief Hospital Course:
60-year-old male with hx of CHF (EF 40%), MI [**2159**], paroxysmal
ventricular tachyarrhythmia s/p pacemaker/ICD placement and VT
ablation in [**4-/2174**] presenting with altered mental status in
setting of severe hyperglycemia.
.
#Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic coma (HHNK):
Pt did not have diagnosis of DM on admission. Pt presented with
altered mental status and labs concerning for HHNK - blood
glucose [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62434**] glucose in UA, anion gap of 18, with absence
of ketones in urine favoring HHS over DKA. A1c on [**1-/2175**] was
6.5; A1c on admission was 13.3.  The patient was placed on an
insulin drip for approximately 90 minutes.  [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes
Center was consulted and he was transitioned to a Lantus +
Humalog insulin sliding scale regimen and aggressively volume
resuscitated with 4L NS. Hyperglycemia rapidly improved and gap
closed.  His lantus was gradually titrated to 30 units [**Hospital1 **] with
appropriate sliding scale with good glycemic control.  In the
setting of WBC of 20 on admission, the trigger of the HHNK was
thought to be infectious with the source ultimately found to be
a right groin cellulitis as detailed below. Other infectious
etiologies were considered, but the work-up was negative, with
CXR showing no consolidation, and UA/UC negative.
.
#Right groin ulcer:
Right groin ulcer identified upon physical exam following
transfer from ICU.  Evaluated by surgery who ultimately
performed I&D, recovering necrotic tissue that ultimately
cultured Staph Aureus and coagulase negative Staph sensitive to
Bactrim.  Treated with IV Vancomycin and Zosyn for a total
course of 14 days and transitioned to Bactrim prior to
discharge.
.
#Hyponatremia:
Na 119 on admission due hyperglycemia. Normalized with treatment
of HHNK.
.
#Altered mental status:
Altered mental status was most likely secondary to HHNK. With
resolution of HHNK, mental status cleared markedly and pt was
oriented x 3 and answered questions appropriately once
transferred to the floor.
.
#Acute renal failure:
Cr was 2.8 on admission, up from 1.5 one month prior. Initially
acute renal failure was believed to be prerenal as pt appeared
severely volume depleted.  Cr continued to rise, peaking at 3.6,
despite IV hydration.  In setting of elevated CKs, acute renal
failure was attributed to rhabdomyolysis for which he was given
additional IV hydration, although this rise in CK was ultimately
attributed to a significant right groin abscess.  Nephrotoxic
meds, including his home lasix, allopurinol, diovan and
spironolactone, were held during the majority of his hospital
course.  As the patient recovered from his HHNK, his renal
function improved markedly to a creatinine of 1.8.  He was
eventually restarted on his lasix and discharged on his home
regimen of allopurinol, diovan, and spironolactone.
.
#Anemia, guiac positive stool (OUTPATIENT FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED)
The patient had an initial Hgb of 14 and Hct of 40.1 on the day
of admission [**10-30**].  Over the next three days he developed a
slight anemia that remained stable at approximately Hgb 10 Hct
29 for the remaining five days of his administration.  This was
attributed to anemia of inflammation.  He did have one episode
of blood stained stool, and was guiac positive.  Upon interview
the patient attributed this to a known history of hemorrhoids.
Given his age, however, outpatient colonoscopy is still
appropriate to work up his anemia and bloody stool.  The patient
has otherwise been asymptomatic with regard to this anemia.
.
#Depression:
The patient has a history of depression, and his daughter
expressed concern near the end of his hospitalization that he
may try to harm himself.  The patient denied suicidal ideation
and made no concerning statements during his hospital course.
He was seen by psychaitry, who cleared him for discharge and
confirmed no suicidal ideation.
.
#Chronic Systolic CHF, LV aneurysm, INR:
Pt with hx of systolic CHF with EF 40% on TTE.  He required IV
hydration for both HHS and initial concern for rhabdomyolysis
but this was given judiciously given his reduced EF.  TTE was
obtained that showed unchanged EF of 40% and mid inferior and
inferolateral akinesis which had previously been hypokinetic on
TTE from [**3-/2175**]; there was also an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm.  Lasix was held due to acute renal failure until late
in his hospitalization but restarted several days prior to
discharge in the setting of dependent pitting edema.  On
discharge, lungs were clear to auscultation and the patient was
clinically mildly h
