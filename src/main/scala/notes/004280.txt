HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old lady
with past medical history significant for hypertension and
hypothyroidism as well as past surgical history significant
for appendectomy and bladder resuspension. She presented to
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital on [**3-23**] with shortness of breath
and weakness and was found to have bilateral pneumonia.  At
the time, she was treated for the bilateral pneumonia and it
was discovered that she had significantly loculated
pneumothorax on imaging studies. Her respiratory status
worsened and she was intubated on [**2125-3-29**].  She eventually
required pressor support for presumed sepsis.  On [**4-2**], at
[**Hospital3 1443**], there was an attempt to drain the large
loculated left pneumothorax by placement of a CT guided
pigtail catheter.  Unfortunately, during the procedure , the
descending thoracic aorta was punctured. The patient was
transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation and treatment. Upon arrival,
she was hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 and
was taken emergently to the operating room.
Intraoperatively, the pigtail catheter was found to be in
through the lung and in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aorta was primarily repaired and the pigtail catheter was
removed without any problems. At the same time, the thoracic
surgery team performed a left lower lobe bullectomy.
Postoperative, the course of the patient was fraught with
complications. She demonstrated extensive bilateral pulmonary
edema and required to be placed on N.O. for elevated
pulmonary pressures and in order to maintain sufficient mixed
venous saturations.  Attempts to wean the N.O. initially
failed. The patient's renal function also gradually worsened
and she finally developed acute renal failure, requiring
CVVH.  At the same time, she became coagulopathic and
presented with a picture of DIC. Indicative lab values are a
value of fibrinogen of 79, an INR of 4.6, PT which rose as
high as 42 and a PTT which rose as high as 60.  Also
indicative was a value of D-Dimer that rose to 7183. Finally,
in the morning of [**2125-4-9**], she came off the N.O. but still
requiring high doses of Neo-Synephrine for pressor support to
maintain her blood pressure. Her condition did not improve
and in the afternoon of [**4-10**], the attending physician had [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
meeting with the family and the patient's critical condition
was discussed. The decision was made by the family for
pressor support to be withdrawn.  Comfort measures were
started and the patient expired shortly thereafter.  The date
of death was [**4-10**] and the time of death was 16:30 in the
evening. The medical examiner was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the case was
accepted by the medical examiner. The family also requested
an autopsy that will be performed by the pathology department
of [**Hospital1 69**].
