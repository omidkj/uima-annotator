Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI, shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
81yo F with hyperlipidemia, PVD, CKD who initially presented to
OSH with dyspnea on [**4-4**].  She woke up in the middle of the night
with acute SOB, without associated chest pain or diaphoresis,
possibly with nausea.  The week PTA, she had been experiencing
flu-like symptoms (cough, rhinorrhea, myalgias).  At the OSH,
she had a CXR with pulmonary edema, elevated cardiac enzymes
(troponin T 0.2--> 3.33), proBNP 35,000, and she developed
inferior ST elevations that reportedly resolved on heparin and
integrilin.  She also received beta blocker and Lasix, and was
transiently on nitro gtt.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Hospital Unit Name 196**]) yesterday for consideration
of catheterization and for further workup and management.  She
was initially continued on heparin and integrilin, and received
1U PRBC for a Hct of 23.9.  This morning, she developed acutely
worsening shortness of breath.  She also had hemoptysis x 2, for
total of ~100cc dark red blood.  Her integrilin was stopped.
Her SBP transiently dropped to the 70s, but improved without
intervention.  She was also on a nitro gtt transiently, and
received Lasix 120mg IV x 1 and Diuril 250mg IV x 1.  She had
increasing O2 requirement and was put on 100% NRB.  Given her
tenuous respiratory status and labile BP, she was transferred to
the CCU for closer monitoring.
.
Currently, she denies chest pain, palpitations, fever/chills,
abdominal pain.  She is still feeling short of breath.

.
ECG: NSR @ 70bpm, nl axis, QTc 456, Q wave in III, STE in III,
<0.5mm STE in aVF, TWI I/L/V3-6, LVH.
.
CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild interstitial edema
has improved, but peripheral consolidative opacities in the left
upper lung as well as left perihilar consolidation that is new,
raise possibility of pneumonia particularly aspiration.  No
pneumothorax.  Pleural effusion, if any, is small, on the right.

.
TTE ([**4-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the inferolateral wall, hypokinesis of the
mid-inferior wall, and mild dyskinesis of the basal inferior and
distal inferior walls. The remaining left ventricular segments
contract normally.  EF 35-40%.  Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic  valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened with prominent mitral annular calcifictation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.  The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
 Briefly, this is an 81yo F with smoking history,
hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital 66942**] transferred from OSH after having 1 week of
flu like symptoms, dyspnea, and was found to have STEMI with
pulmonary edema and BNP [**Numeric Identifier 14123**]. The pt was diuresed and treated
with integrillin, heparin, asa, plavix at OSH, and transferred
to [**Hospital1 **] for cath/evaluation. She also had had a single fever at
OSH to 102. The pt was admitted on [**4-4**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] with for possible
cath, but was then transferred to CCU for hypoxic respiratory
distress and hypotension.  The pt was found to have multifocal
pneumonia vs. pulmonary hemorrhage on CT, as well as severe
emphysematous disease. Integrillin and heparin were ultimately
discontinued. The pt was started on levo/flagyl for empiric
treatment of aspiration PNA. Pulmonary consult felt her sxs were
likely due to PNA/bronchitis and her hemoptysis/bleeding was
likely [**2-4**] anticoagulants.   In regards to her STEMI, the pt was
felt to have likely RCA disease given STE in inferior leads.
Cath was deferred given the pts ARF. Renal also was consulted
for the pts [**Doctor First Name 48**] (baseline Cr 2, Cr here up to) felt to be due to
ATN.  She also had diarrhea on the floor and her stool culture
came back positive for C. difficile.
.
CCU course [**Date range (1) 52620**]/06:
On [**4-11**], she had acute respiratory distress with acute onset
shortness of breath and desaturation to 88% on room air, in the
setting of SBP to 150s-170s.  She had diffuse rales on exam.
EKG showed persistent ST elevations inferiorly, and more
prominent ST changes and T-wave inversions V1-2, concerning for
ischemia.  The most likely cause for her respiratory distress
was thought to be acute pulmonary edema possibly secondary to
ischemia, however her differential did include aspiration
pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hemorrhage.  She
was placed on a nonrebreather mask, but did not improve with
nitroglycerin drip, IV furosemide, and morphine.  She was
intubated for continued respiratory distress and paradoxical
breathing.  After long discussion with the family and Cardiology
staff, the decision was made not to pursue cardiac
catheterization given the likelihood that it may lead to the
need for hemodialysis, which the family felt would be against
the patient's wishes.  She was brought to the CCU for further
care.  The patient's family also decided to make the patient
DNR.  In the CCU, her temperature was found to be 104.9.  She
had worsening bilateral alveolar opacities on chest x-ray,
thought to indicate pulmonary hemorrhage vs. aspiration.  She
was on maximal ventilatory support but had persistent
progressive hypoxia.  She also developed hypotension requiring
pressors.  Her clinical picture was thought to be consistent
with sepsis, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.  In
continuing extensive family discussion, her children felt the
patient would not have wanted such aggressive intervention.  The
decision was made to withdraw pressors but to keep her
intubated.  On the morning of [**4-12**], she became asystolic and was
pronounced dead.
