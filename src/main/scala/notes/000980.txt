Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Cellulitis, troponin leak

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bedside debridement of eschar on right foot


History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with MM including PVD, DM, HTN, CAD, CRI transferred
from NWH for cellulitis/LE pain because pt's podiatric surgeon
is at [**Hospital1 18**]. Initally presented to NWH because of increasing
right foot pain and redness. At NWH, found to have EKG changes
with STD in V2-V4, though patient was asymptomatic and said he
never had chest pain. Unclear if he received abx from there per
records available. Patient was transferred here for further
management.
.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 91344**] in the ICU
at NWH when he was found at home unresponsive - was hypoglycemic
and in ARF. Patient states he does not remember 'anything' about
that hospital stay, the medications he was on or any events that
occurred then. Per report, he was discharged on lovenox for DVT
but when NWH ED was [**Name (NI) 653**], records there indicated that he
was started on Lovenox ppx because he was immobile and was
supposed to continue taking it until he was able to consistently
walk >100 feet. Unclear if patient has been administering the
lovenox himself as he stated that he no longer gives himself
insulin because 'it's just too complicated'.
.
On past hospitalization at NWH, also had a troponin has high as
8.8 thought be due to demand ischemia in the setting of
hypoglycemia. During that admission, he never had chest pain and
a stable percent MB fraction at 0.7. He was started on aspirin,
beta blocker and statin. An ACEi was held due to intolerance in
the past.
.
In the ED here VS: AF, hr:67, bp:130/70, rr:16 98% on RA.
Received fentanyl for pain, cards and vascular were c/s. Blood
cx were drawn. Vascular recommended vanc/zosyn given their
concern for osteo which he received. He received 50mg iv
fentanyl for pain.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient c/o of persistent right foot
pain. Denies fever or chills, CP, SOB, N/V/D, constipation, HA
or vision changes.
.
The patient is not a competent historian. On review of systems,
he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems per HPI.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG ([**9-20**]): Sinus rhythm. Right axis deviation. Incomplete right
bundle branch block. One to two millimeter downsloping ST
segment depression in the anterior leads extending from leads
V3-V6. Consider myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2153-9-19**] the ST-T wave changes are pretty similar
except that the lead placement is slightly different.

Imaging:

Xray of right foot ([**9-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Erosive bony destructions at the first distal phalanx and at
the stump of the second proximal phalanx consistent with
osteomyelitis.
2. Severe degenerative changes in the tarsometatarsal joints and
fracture at the 3rd metatarsal, suggesting early Charcot joint
disease.
3. Significant small vessel disease.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**9-20**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with
