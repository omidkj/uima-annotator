Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo F w/ h/o COPD, and HTN who presents c/o SOB, cough, CP,
and recent syncopal episode. The following issues were
investigated during this hospitalization:
.
#) COPD exacerbation:  Pt's shortness of breath and hypoxia
(Pa02 of 60% on presentation) were thought to be from COPD
exacerbation.  CHF felt to be unlikely given lack of findings on
exam and BNP 444.  PE ruled out with CTA.  EKG unremarkable.
Recent normal MIBI. Her COPD exacerbation was likely due to
bronchitis vs. viral URI.  Given the severity of her
exacerbation, she was initially admitted to the MICU, where she
recieved frequent nebs, IV solumedrol, and levofloxacin.  She
did not require intubation.  She was gradually tapered down to
3L NC. Pt was eventually transferred to the medicine wards.  Her
steroids were changed to gradual, prednisone taper. Her nebs
were changed to MDI w/ spacer.  As well, she completed 7days of
levofloxacin. Pt responded well to these therapies, though she
continued to have 02 requirement.  Her oxygen saturations with
ambulation were ~87-89% on 3L.  Of note, she has no known PFTs.
She will need these as an outpatient, once her acute flare has
resolved.  Additionaly, she would likely benefit from outpatient
pulmonary follow-up, for which she is scheduled.  Lastly,
smoking cessation was encourage & she received nicotine patch.

.
# CP: Pt complained of sharp back & chest pain that were mostly
associated w/ cough.  Though this discomfort was thought to be
musculoskeletal pain or pleurisy related to URI, she was ruled
out for MI & had CTA to rule out PE.  As above, pt had
unremarkable EKG as well as history of recent normal MIBI.
.
# HYPONATREMIA: Though to be related to HCTZ.  Serum Na dropped
as low 125.  Improved with fluid restriction and holding HCTZ.
.
# S/P SYNCOPE/FALL: Story consistent with mechanical fall.
Patient reports to fall w/ syncope 3 days prior to admission,
when her dog jumped on her, knocked her to ground, she hit head
and "passed out."  No headache during hospitalization, nor any
at the time of the event.  Neuro exam non-focal.  Given that she
was doing well several days out from event, no imaging was
undertaken as it is unlikely that she developed SDH.
.
# Vertebral compression fractures: Incidentally discover T5 and
T7 compression fractures on CT.  Acuity unknown. No pain. She
was started on Calcium and Vitamin D and SPEP/UPEP was negative.
Patient will be referred to PCP for outpatient [**Name9 (PRE) 8019**] of
etiology and further treatment.
.
# HTN: Patient had hypertensive urgency on admission.  Required
IV hydralazine while in MICU to bring down BP.  Her PO meds were
up-titrated to improve BP control.  Confirmed w/ PCP that
patient is both on [**Last Name (un) **] and ACEi. She was maintained on this
regiment with good effect.
