4. Severe atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and
coronary arteries.
5. Severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the MICU. She was volume repleted and her
blood pressure supported with levophed and vasopressin. Her
infection was treated with Zosyn. Balancing the pt's volume
status, respiratory status and blood pressure was challenging.
Managment of her infected stone was discussed with both IR and
urology; it was felt that and IR based procedure would be safest
for her. The pt's anticoagulation was revered with Vitamin K and
FFP. The pt was taken to the IR suit, however at the end of the
procedure after the nephrostomy tube was in place, she
precipitously desaturated, went into cardiac arrest and expired.
The pt's code status of DNR/DNI had been verified with her and
her family several times prior to the procedure and they were
clear that it was not even temporarily reversible; the pt's PCP
was notified at the time of her passing.
