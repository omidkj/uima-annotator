Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
vertebroplasty [**2198-2-1**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 year-old M with ESRD on HD, HTN, obesity, CAD s/p
stenting, HCV, metastatic poorly differentiated cancer (likely
NSCLC) who presents with SOB. He complained of SOB before HD
today, which did not immediately improved post-dialysis, so he
was sent to the ED. No chest pain, jaw pain, dizziness, or
lightheadedness. No fever or chills. Of note, he was recently
admitted [**Date range (1) 58897**] with pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertension and dietary indiscretion.

On arrival to the ED his SOB had improved. He was given [**Date range (1) **] 325
mg. EKG was reportedly unchanged from baseline, CXR was without
pulmonary edema or infiltrate. Cardiac enzymes were sent with a
troponin slightly above recent values (0.17 from 0.14 last
week). He was admitted to rule-out MI.

Currently reports feeling well, except for neck pain (no pain
meds given since the a.m.).

ROS: No facial pain. No nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. Has been
wearing his cervical collar at all times. He is on antibiotics
for parotiditis and CDiff.

Past Medical History:
#. Onc HX: [**12-11**] pre renal transplant CT scan chest noted
enlarged RML nodule, w/ subcentimeter FDG avid scattered LNs.
Developed neck pain and found to have C2 pathological fracture,
[**11-22**] cytology demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma. Per
onc notes, is likely non-small cell lung carcinoma, with RML
mass and metastasis to the cervical and sacral spine. The only
manifestation of his disease currently is cervical neck pain,
s/p pathologic fx and posterior cervical arthrodesis C1-C3 and
palliative XRT.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-19**]: Two views are compared with recent studies dated [**1-14**]
and [**2198-1-12**]. Allowing for differences in technique, overall
appearance is not much changed. There is persistent right middle
lobe consolidation, likely post-obstructive related to the known
[**Location (un) 21851**] in this location. Infiltration of adjacent
parenchyma is not excluded. No new focal consolidation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution and blurring,
improved since [**1-12**], with no overt edema or pleural effusion.
.
CT NECK [**11-19**]:
1  Enlarged right parotid gland and right parotid duct.  Tiny
1-2 mm stone
within the proximal right parotid duct.  No definite obstructing
distal ductal stones although evaluation of the most distal
portion of the right parotid duct is limited by streak artifact
from the patient's dental prosthesis. Possibly the findings
could be explained by recent passage of a stone.
2.  Destructive lesion of C2 with associated pathologic fracture
causes
moderate central canal narrowing.
3.  Interval posterior cervical fusion from C1 through C3.
4.  Several small cervical lymph nodes measure less than 1 cm in
short axis and may be reactive.
5.  Multiple small pulmonary nodules of the lung apices measure
up to 9 mm at the right apex are not fully evaluated on this
neck CT.
6.  Emphysema.
.
[**2198-1-20**] BILATERAL LENI:
1.  Small nonocclusive left common femoral vein thrombus may be
chronic.
2.  No right-sided DVT.
.
CT HEAD WITH CONTRAST [**1-21**]:
No hemorrhage or abnormal area of enhancement.  If there is high
suspicion of metastatic lesion MRI is more sensitive.
.
CTA OF THE CHEST [**1-21**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  No pulmonary embolism.
2.  Right middle lobe spiculated mass with increased number and
size of
numerous pulmonary nodules, right hilar and  mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, new right middle lobe bronchus encasement and
obstruction as well as osseous metastasis (see below) all
consistent with substantial progression of disease when compared
to the CT of [**2197-12-24**].
3.  New acute pathologic compression fracture involving the T4
vertebral body and lytic lesion involving the transverse process
of the T4 vertebral body.
4.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
5.  Extensive paraseptal and centrilobular emphysematous
disease.
.
[**Date Range **] [**1-23**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-12-4**],
the left ventricle is now more dilated, left ventricular
systolic function is now more depressed and mitral regurgitation
is now more prominent. Regional wall motion abnormalities are
similar.
.
[**2198-1-24**] MRI THORACIC SPINE: IMPRESSION: Signal hyperintensity in
T4 vertebral body and right transverse process, consistent with
known metastasis. No epidural disease is seen, however it cannot
be completely excluded due to the non-diagnostic axial images.
For further details on the cervical spine, please see the prior
examination of [**11-16**].
.
[**2198-2-6**] MRI CERVICAL SPINE: CONCLUSION: Limited study due to the
lack of intravenous contrast and due to artifacts arising from
the fusion hardware. There is angulation and kyphosis with its
apex at C2. This, in addition to tumor breaking through the
posterior margin of the vertebral body produces narrowing of the
spinal canal, but not spinal cord compression. There is
extensive paravertebral tumor spread at the C2 level. There
appears to be a second tumor deposit in the C3-C4 neural
foramen.
.
[**2198-2-12**] CT C-SPINE: IMPRESSION:
1. Complete destruction of C2 vertebral body by tumor
involvement.
2. Fracture of the left lateral mass of C1 just lateral to the
screw.
3. Left lamina of C2 demonstrates screw protrusion anteriorly.
4. Intra-facet joint location of C3 facet screws.
5. Necrotic level II lymph nodes posterior to and causing slight
compression of left IJ vein.
.
[**2198-2-13**] EMG: IMPRESSION:
Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for a
moderately severe, subacute (between 3 weeks and 3 months) C5
radiculopathy on the left. There is also evidence for an
underlying mild, generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropat
