Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty to arouse and respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intracerebral Drain
VP shunt
PEG placement
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
65 yo male with past medical history of schizophrenia,
depression, pituatary adenoma s/p resection [**2166**] transferred
from OSH with head CT showing intracranial hemorrhage without
shift. Pt recently admitted to OSH ([**9-22**]) presents with
difficulty to arouse and respiratory distress (negative chest CT
and labs). Pt subsequently discharged back to long term care
facility. Symptoms persisted so he was brought to another OSH
for further evaluation where a head CT was performed and bleed
was appreciated. Vital signs T 101.7 (tylenol given), BP 151/90,
HR 83 sinus, RR 22, O2 sat 98. At the OSH, pt was placed on
levofloxacin 250 mg iv q8 hrs ([**9-25**]), metronidazole 500 mg IV q6
hrs, salumetrol 60 mg IV q 24 hrs, albuterol 2.5 mg + atrovent
0.5 mg nebulizer q6 hrs.  Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation/treatment.

Baseline evaluation per long term care facility- ambulates with
assist; alert and oriented x 3, knows mother's name and staff
names.

ROS: Unable.

Past Medical History:
adrenal insufficiency, GERD, degenerative joint disease,
hypopituatary, chronic paranoid schizophrenia, depression,
?dementia, chronic back pain
PSH: pituatary adenoma resection ([**2166**])


Social History:

[**2176-9-24**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:
There is increased density in the lateral ventricles especially
on the left as well as the third ventricle and probably the
interpeduncular cistern and/or the region of the lamina
terminalis.  There is a small amount of increased density in the
acqueduct and fourth ventricle.  There is a small amount of
increased density peripherally in the posterior frontal on the
right and parietal region on the left consistent with a
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ventricles and sulci are mildly
prominent.  There is low density in the periventricular white
matter.  The appearance of the sella is abnormal. There is a
history on subsequent examinations (this examination is being
interpreted on [**2176-9-30**]) of a transsphenoidal resection of a
pituitary tumor and the appearance of the sella is consistent
with.
IMPRESSION: Intracranial hemorrhage is noted.  This is largely
intraventricular but some of this is subarachnoid.
CT ANGIOGRAM: There is no definite evidence of aneurysm or flow
abnormality. There is no evidence of vascular malformation.
There is no evidence of irregularity of the arteries in the
region of the skull base.  There is mild calcification of the
cavernous carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of aneurysm or apparent cause for the
intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2176-9-25**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:
INDICATIONS:  65-year-old man status post ventricular catheter
replacement.
COMPARISONS:  Prior evening.
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS:  There is a new ventricular catheter, extending from a
right frontal approach, and terminating in the right lateral
ventricle.  There is a small amount of nondependent air in the
right lateral ventricle, and pneumocephalus, presumed related to
recent surgery.  There is a similar degree of intraventricular
hemorrhage occupying much of the left lateral and the entire
third ventricle.  There is also similar hemorrhage within the
right anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**], layering in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  The
degree of ventricular dilatation is similar, and primarily
involves the supratentorial ventricles, and again noted is a
subependymal edema, which may overlap somewhat with diffuse
white matter hypodensity suggestive of chronic small vessel
ischemic disease. There is opacification of the sphenoid sinus
and some of the posterior ethmoid cells, which is often seen in
intubation.  Mastoid air cells are clear. Osseous structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Similar appearance of extensive intraventricular hemorrhage
with
hydrocephalus of the supratentorial ventricles.
2.  Status post ventricular catheter placement with appropriate
positioning.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW:  There is irregularity at the
margins of the sphenoid sinus, with areas of demineralization.
There may not be integrity of the sinus walls and a direct
coronal sinus CT could provide a better evaluation of this area.
 In addition, there is asymmetric soft tissue at the right side
of the sella, and a sella mass cannot be excluded.  A sella MRI
with gadolinium should be obtained for further evaluation. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11315**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] with these findings on [**2176-9-25**].
