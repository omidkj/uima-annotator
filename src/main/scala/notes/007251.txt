Service: [**Month/Day/Year 662**]

Allergies:
Penicillins / Shellfish Derived

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
86 year old female with a past medical history of
occipital stroke with memory difficulties, atrial fibrillation,
Cdiff, dCHF on 2L at home, severe AS, presented with SOB
increasing x 4-5 days. F/C/S/N/V/, diarrhea periodically
foul-smelling.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.4 94 85/46 36 100 on NRB. They thought
CHF on home O2 but did not give lasix because worried about low
SBPs. Got levo/flaygl and IV vanco for recurrence of Cdiff. On
NRB 99% 29, 99, 95/30. 89/41 87/. Niece had preferred no ICU
admission. No documented rectal. Patient refused central line
downstairs. CXR, CTA, EKG done. BCx not done prior to
antibiotics. Patient only had 20G IV.
.
Of note, patient has had multiple hospitalizations since [**6-17**],
at first for new atrial flutter as well as signs of posterior
cardioembolic strokes.  She was started on aspirin/clopidogrel
anticoagulation, rate controlled, and diuresed before being
discharged to rehab.  Unfortunately, her rehab course was
complicated by two hospitalizations at an outside hospital.  One
of these hospitalizations was for hospital associated pneumonia
but the cause of the other was unknown.  She is now status post
a hospitalization [**8-17**] for C diff colitis sepsis complicated by
exacerbation of her diastolic CHF and delirium.  She
subsequently completed a course of PO Vancomycin.
.
Currently, patient complaining of "feeling ill" but does not go
into detail about what is bothering her. She seems confused and
keeps referring to her niece [**Name (NI) 382**] as her roommate. She denied,
CP, cough, fever, chills, abdominal pain or diarrhea. Her niece
endorsed worsening DOE and at rest. She also reported diarrhea
that was large and foul-smelling at home X3 days for which she
gave her immodium. Her niece endorsed that the patient is not
aggitated at home so she stopped the Zyprexa from a previous
admission which she had been prescribed for delirum.
.
A discussion was had about her goals upon admission given her
low blood pressure and limited IV access.  The patient and the
niece were perfectly clear about refusing central lines even if
that could be a way to give pressure support and antibiotics
that could be potentially life saving. They understood that were
not giving her standard of care and understood that the risks
include potentially death.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.

CTA:
1. Suboptimal evaluation of the peripheral pulmonary arterial
branches due to patient respiratory motion. No evidence of
pulmonary embolism in the central or segmental pulmonary
arterial branches.
2. Pulmonary edema and increased moderate right pleural effusion
with
overlying atelectasis.
3. Asymmetric right breast tissue. Recommend correlation with
mammography.
4. Indeterminant right renal cystic lesion, suboptimally
evaluated on recent renal ultrasound. Recommend renal MRI for
further evaluation since ultrasound findings were
non-conclusive.
.
ECHO:
Left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. There
is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-9-1**],
the RV appears slightly larger with RVH present (probably
present on the prior study). The degree of pulmonary
hypertension detected has increased.
.
CXR:
Moderately severe pulmonary edema collecting at the lung bases
and small right pleural effusion has increased. Heart size is
normal despite the extremely heavily calcified mitral annulus.
Prior imaging has shown severe aortic valvular calcification,
heavy atherosclerotic calcification, and severe emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital
stroke with memory difficulties, atrial fibrillation, Cdiff,
dCHF on 2L at home, severe AS, presented with SOB increasing x
4-5 days

#. Hypotension: Patient was admitted to MICU for hypotension in
the setting of diarrhea.  She refused central line placement and
treatment with pressors in the emergency room.  In the MICU,
dilt and lasix were held, and patient was initially treated with
IVFs and albumin with good response.  Subsequently, patient
became dyspneic with O2 requirement.  While in the
