Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
48 y/o M w/hx of EtOH abuse who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2163-5-13**] c/o hematemesis.  He was a somewhat vague
historian, but c/o persistent n/v of bright red blood.  Denied
melena.  Noted decreased UOP.  Drinks daily, with last drink at
midnight on day of admission.  In [**12-29**], he was admitted to [**Hospital **] with CP, noted to have Hct 28, and had an EGD that
revealed mild reflux esophagitis, no varices, and small gastric
ulcerations.

On [**5-13**], he called EMS c/o hematemesis.  At that time he was
hypotensive to 80/40, pulse 67.  Labs revealed ABG 6.97/41/141,
Hct 20, plt 39, INR 1.6, creatinine 12.1, bicarb 11, calcium 5,
bili 8.3, AST 587, ALT 158, alk phos 433.  He had an EGD which
revealed fresh large clot traveling down the entire length of
the esophagus.  No varices.  Large fresh thrombus in fundus.
There was concern that some of the bleeding was from his
nasopharynx, and ENT visualized a laceration in his right
nasopharynx that they packed extensively.  He was begun on
octreotide and protonix, given 9 units PRBC and 12 pk of
platelets.  Placed on levophed and neo.  Given IVF w/sodium
bicarb but remained anuric.  They placed a subclavian dialysis
catheter and emergently dialyzed him on [**5-14**].  Later that day he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  During the [**Location (un) 7622**], he became
hypotensive and was begun on vasopressin.  He was bleeding from
his eyes, nose, and ETT.

CXR: IMPRESSION: 1) ET tube in satisfactory position.
2) Right central line tip approximately at SVC/RA junction.
3) Feeding tube tip high, probably in region of GE junction.
This was called to the nurse caring for this patient.
4) Patchy increased density right perihilar and left
retrocardiac region.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the MICU service.  He was felt to have
alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis, with a GI bleed of unclear
source, and  ARF.  His respiratory failure was felt due to
anasarca from the massive amt of fluids and blood products he
required.  He was given levofloxacin, empiric decadron, and
continued on pressors.  He was placed on CVVH on admission
because he was anuric, acidemic, and difficult to
oxygenate/ventilate.  Bladder pressure was checked at was
elevated at 28, but he had no ascites on abdominal ultrasound.
Surgery was called re: abdominal compartment syndrome but did
not feel he had any indications for surgery.  He was placed on
paralytics, resulting in decreased abd pressure.  He was
transfused 3 add'l units of PRBCs and 9 of FFP.  He continued to
require additional pressors, including dopamine, levophed, and
vasopressin.  Because of his multi-organ system failure and grim
prognosis, a family meeting was held.  He had worsening acidosis
and hypotension despite maximum pressors.  The family decided to
change goals of care to comfort measures only, and he died on
[**2163-5-15**].
