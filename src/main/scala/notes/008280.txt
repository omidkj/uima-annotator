Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he was taken to the Operating Room where
coronary artery grafting and mitral repair/annuloplasty and
ligation of the left atrial appendage were performed.  See
operative note for details.  He weaned from bypass on low dose
neo synephrine and Propofol.  He remained stable, was weaned
from the ventilator and was extubated easily.  Pressors were
weaned, he was begun on low dose beta blockade and Amiodarone
for brief atrial fibrillation.

Diuresis was begun and he was transferred to the floor.  Due to
prolongation of the PR interval the EPS service was consulted.
The Amiodarone was discontinued.  The PR interval normalized and
he remained in sinus rhythm.  He was approaching his
preoperative weight  and diuretics were continued at discharge.

Insulin was continued and he was discharged on the dose he took
at home.  Pacing wires had been removed prior to discharge. He
was discharged to home having been instructed as to medications,
precautions and follow up care.
