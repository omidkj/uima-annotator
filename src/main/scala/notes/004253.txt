Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Top
normal/borderline dilated LV cavity size. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Mildly dilated descending
aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild to
moderate ([**12-10**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail. Eccentric MR jet.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of ascending aorta and arrch levels
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-10**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. There appears to be flail of the P3
leaflet of the mitral valve. An eccentric jet of moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion.

POST BYPASS: The patient is AV paced and on an infusion of
phenylephrine. Left and right ventricular function is preserved.
The aorta is intact. A mitral valve repair has been performed
and an annuloplasty band placed. There is now no MR. Mild to
moderate AR persists. The remainder of the examination is
unchanged.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room emergently due to
bleeding in the right groin at the site of the intraortic
balloon pump.  He underwent CABG x 2, mitral valve repair with
28mm [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (un) 3843**] Band and repair of the right femoral
artery (by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].  Please see operative report for
further details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CVICU post operatively for
further monitoring.  On POD 1 the patient remained intubated and
hemodynamics were supported with phenylephrine, norepinephrine
and epinephrine.  Within 24 hours of surgery, the patient was
extubated and the balloon pump was discontinued.  Vasoactive
drips were weaned off.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor on POD 3.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was gently
diuresed toward his preoperative weight.  Social work consult
was obtained for family's concern of patient's history of
emotional/verbal abuse towards family members, including wife
who recently had a stroke.  Additionally, geriatrics consult was
obtained for further management of this issue.  The geriatrics
team will continue to follow the patient when he is discharged
to rehab.  The patient made reasonable progress
post-operatively.  He was discharged to the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on POD
6.
