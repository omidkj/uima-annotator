MICRO:

STUDIES:
[**5-1**] CXR: Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinum within normal
limits. Lungs are clear. Multiple leads project over the chest.
IMPRESSION: Probably no active disease in the chest.

[**5-4**]: TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 60%). There is a small paramembranous ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted to L&D in active labor. She had a
spontaneous vaginal delivery. Her labor was uncomplicated. her
delivery was complicated by 2nd degree laceration and uterine
atony. She received 100 mcg cytotec PR, 0.2 mg methergine IM,
and 40 units of pitocin IV. The total estimated blood loss was
500cc. The uterotonics controlled the vaginal bleeding but
shortly after delivery the patient experienced palpiations. She
became hypotensive with nadir BP of 57/33. She received a total
of 1000 mcg of phenylephrine over the following several hours,
divided into several 100 and 200 mcg boluses. Her BP
subsequently stabilized with systolic readings in the 100-110s.
Her symptoms resolved. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] postpartum
for continued monitoring.
.
# Hypotension: Likely [**1-5**] hypovolemia, given blood loss during
delivery and conservative IV fluid resuscitation in setting of
known structural cardiac abnormalities. Cardiology was consulted
and felt that the patient could tolerate IV fluids, to which her
blood pressure responded well. She did not require phenylephrine
after arriving in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. No evidence of volume overload on CXR,
and no peripheral signs of right heart failure. No signs of
SIRS/sepsis, as patient is afebrile, with normal WBC this
morning. Cardiogenic etiology also thought possible, given
elevated cardiac enzymes, but less likely. She had a TTE to
evaluate for new wall motion abnormalities which showed only
stable mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (see attached
report). The on-call physician at the patient's cardiology
practice ([**Location (un) 86**] Adult Congenital Heart Disease clinic) was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and made aware of the events. The patient was
hemodynamically stable upon transfer to the postpartum floor. On
the postpartum floor her vitals remained normal and she denied
symtoms of palpitations/chest pain.
.
# Palpitations/chest pain/Tetralogy of Fallot: ECG abnormal in
setting of repaired tetralogy but generally unchanged from
prior, but had no ischemic changes. Cardiac enzyme elevation
(troponins peaked at 0.09) was likely [**1-5**] demand ischemia in
setting of hypotension, tachycardia, vasopressors. Tachycardia
likely [**1-5**] hypovolemia as above, +/- anxiety. Subjective
palpitations and tachycardia both improving with IV fluids and
reassurance.
.
# Vaginal bleed s/p spontaneous vaginal delivery: patient had
moderate lochia postpartum and her fundus remained firm. Her
hematocrit decreased from 39.9 on admission to 22.6 postpartum.
She received two units of packed RBCs and her Hct improved to
27.3, with follow-up Hct stable at 27.0.
