Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: 79M with a history of  Cirrhosis, with multiple
episodes of hepatic encephalopathy the most recent of which was
2 days prior to admission, admitted with somnolence and
lethargy, elevated ammonia. He was started on MUST protocol for
sepsis, it was also felt that he was likely hypovolemic. There
was no evidence of ascites on an U/S performed 4 days prior to
admission.  He had no infiltrate on CXR. Based upon no apparent
evidence of infection, antibiotics were not given.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim
test was performed which showed normal funciton.  Blood
cultures, urine cultures were drawn.  Initially he was started
on Levophed drip for hyptension.  He was treated aggressively
with Lactulose until he stooled.  His BP recovered rapidly as
did his mental status.  Once he was normotensive and no longer
confused he was transfered to the floor.  On the floor his diet
was advanced slowly and Lactulose was continued.  He did well
and had no further episodes of confusion or hypotension.  He was
discharged home on Lactulose.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy/MS: He has a history of poor dietary
compliance. He was  started on Lactulose Q2H until he had
multiple large BMs in the ICU.  An Ultrasound was performed
which showed no ascites to tap.  His mental status cleared and
he was transferred out of the ICU.  While on the floor an EGD
was performed to evaluate for varices, this showed grade 1 varix
+ nodule.

failure.  His creatinine resolved to 1.0 prior to discharge.
