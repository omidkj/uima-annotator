Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Inability to ambulate d/t L foot pain/ L groin pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
72 to F w/ hx bipolar d/o CHF (no TTE?), COPD (on Spiriva,
[**First Name3 (LF) 4010**], not on home O2), IDDM, who presented to [**Hospital 487**]
hospital
yesterday AM w/ worsening L-foot pain. Per pt, she fell at her
home and injured her foot approx 3wks ago in setting of charcot
foot.  Her PCP tx her [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ PO morphine w/o much improvement. She
feels she has become more confused, lethargic and somnolent
since
starting the Morphine. She is on C-PAP at night but still
expereinces daytime somnolence. She was x-ferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
from
[**Hospital1 487**] for further mgt of her foot pain.

ED VS T: 98.0 BP: 120/50, HR: 72, RR: 20 O2: 96% on 2L.

In the ED ([**8-14**]) she c/o L-foot and L-hip pain. Initial plain
films in ED negative for fx. LLE Doppler U/S which was (-)for
DVT. EKG showed sinus brady, no signs of ischemia. CT head was
(-) acute bleed.  She was noted to have aSx desats to mid-80s
which responded to 2-3 L O2 NC.  She reports she ran out of her
COPD inhalers at home and had not been taking them. She also was
noted to have symptomatic hypotension w/ SBP high 80's, c/o mild
light-headedness. Hypotension resolved w/ IVF: 3L NS.
Additionally, she was in acute renal failure w/ Cr 2.2 (baseline
1.2) Concern for PE was raised given her respiratory status, but
CTA could not be ordered due to her rise in Creatinine. A V/Q
was
ordered, but since the wait for this was ~5 hours, she was
admitted to the MICU for further management. She remained
afebrile with stable vitals in MICU, satting 95% on 2L. In MICU,
D-Dimer was negative, so V/Q scan was cancelled. She also had a
normal (A-a) gradient of 22.  Borderline hypotension seemed to
resolve without further intervention as BP in MICU had been in
120s-130s and HR was NSR in 80s-90s. ARF too had resolved in
MICU
and pt was making adequate UOP. She was taken for CT L leg/foot
and then transferred to the floor in stable condition.
On the floor, pt c/o L foot pain especially in the area of her 2
charcot joints, with increased pain up her L-leg and thigh to
the
L-groin area. She feels that the pain has increased since she
has
been in the hospital, and has noticed the increasing thigh/groin
pain only over the past day.

[**2161-8-14**] LENI: IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT in the left lower
extremity.
.
[**2161-8-14**] Plain film of L ankle: IMPRESSION: No fracture or acute
traumatic injury of the ankle. There is poor definition of the
articulations of the talus and calcaneus. Coalition cannot be
excluded. There is history given of a Charcot joint, although
the  involvement exclusively of the hindfoot is atypical. Prior
studies would be helpful to assess for interval change. An
oblique lucency is identified extending anteriorly at the
presumed talar neck and extending along the lateral aspect.
Given the distortion of anatomy, it is unclear whether this
represents a fracture, and if so, of what structure. Given
clinical concern, consider CT for further evaluation.

[**2161-8-14**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage or other acute intracranial process.
2. Mild parenchymal atrophy and chronic lacunar infarct in the
left
cerebellar hemisphere.

[**2161-8-15**] PA and LAT:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-15**], there is a new
streak of
atelectasis at the right base. The patient has taken a somewhat
better
inspiration. The left hemidiaphragm is again not sharply seen.
There is some blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent
with mild atelectasis and effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old female with a history of bipolar disorder,
congestive heart failure, insulin dependent diabetes who
presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] hospital the morning of admission
([**8-14**]) with worsening foot pain who developed mild hypotension
and hypoxia in the emergency room. She had an ABG done in the ED
which showed a PO2 of 71, with AA gradient of 21 which is not
unexpected for her age and D-dimer was negative making PE very
unlikely.  Given somnolence on exam and known history of sleep
apnea, hypoventilation was of concern.  She also has known COPD
and ran out of her inhalers this week so a component of
obstructive lung disease may be contributing.  Her baseline
oxygen saturations are unknown. [**Month/Year (2) 4010**] was restarted and she got
standing albuterol nebs. Pt refused CPAP. Hypoxia resolved in
MICU.
.
Hypotension is of unclear etiology. This may be related to
taking all of her medications in the setting of acute renal
failure.  Per report she also appeared dehydrated on
presentation and partner states she has not taken much PO. She
has no fevers or leukocytosis concerning for infection.  No
signs of cardiac decompensation.  Although she has mild hypoxia,
feel pulmonary embolism is unlikely. Her hypotension then
resolved.
.
Left foot pain/charcot foot- foot pain was treated with
percocet, plain films and CT of the foot demonstrate no
fractures, no injury to soft tissue. L groin pain was likely
neuropathic pain from diabetic neuropathy or pain radiating from
pressing on charcot joints. PT saw patient on day of discharge
and recommended she go home. Her gabapentin was restarted at
600mg TID and this helped with her neuropathic pain.

Her diabetes was well-controlled in house on the regula
