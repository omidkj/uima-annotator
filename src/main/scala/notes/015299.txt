Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
 Aortic dissection and aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Visceral de-branching procedure of the abdominal
aorta using a left ileo to right renal and celiac artery
bypass and a right ileo to left renal and superior mesenteric
artery bypass with 14 x 7 Dacron grafts and resection and
repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 22 x 11
bifurcated Dacron graft.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 41-year-old gentleman with Marfan's
syndrome who initially presented with aortic arch aneurysm,
underwent arch replacement and stent grafting of the arch and
proximal descending thoracic aorta. He subsequently developed
aneurysm of his thoracic aorta. However, he also suffered
from a ruptured esophagus from Boerhaave syndrome. The
dissection went down through the abdominal aorta to the iliac
vessels bilaterally. The abdominal aorta and common iliac
arteries were aneurysmal was well. In order to treat the
thoracic aortic aneurysm with a stent graft we needed to
develop the landing zone in the abdominal aorta by replacing
it with the aortic tube graft and performing visceral de-
branching.
