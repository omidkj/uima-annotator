Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumothorax

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement
Pigtail catheter placement in left lung


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111653**] is an 80 y.o. patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] with atrial fibrillation and Tachy-brady syndrome who
was referred for dual chamber pacemaker placement. This
procedure was performed this morning. Typically, cephalic vein
is used for access; however, patient's vein was somewhat
sclerotic and wire could not be passed. The subclavian vein was
accessed as an alternative; however, air was drawn back with
insertion of the needle. Fluoroscopy during the catheterization
revealed pneumothorax. CXR was obtained and the thoracic surgery
team was consulted. The patient was then transferred to the CCU
for monitoring.
.
With regard to her tachy-brady syndrome, the patient has had a
history of persistent atrial fibrillation since [**Month (only) 404**] for
which she has been anticoagulated since [**Month (only) 958**] (following
TIA/CVA). Holter monitor in [**Month (only) 116**] revealed sustained atrial
fibrillation with HR up to 165 with pauses up to 3.2 seconds;
Lifewatch monitor in [**Month (only) **] revealed pauses up to 4 seconds (per
notes). She has been treated with metoprolol for rate control
(100 mg long acting daily) as well as low-dose digoxin.
.
On review of systems, she endorses prior history of stroke/TIA
(2-minute duration of left arm numbness and aphasia in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2177**]; left parietal infarct noted on imaging) and deep venous
thrombosis in [**2175**] (left leg). No known history of pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery. No myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She has
had recent FUO, but no fever since her last admission and no
chills or rigors or nightsweats. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
syncope or presyncope. She has occasional swelling in the left
ankle only which occurs with standing, present since her DVT in
[**2175**]. She does occasionally experience a "flutter" in the chest
as well as a sensation of her heart pounding.

CXR:
([**2177-7-17**]) IMPRESSION: Stable pneumothorax in the left apical
region with no significant interval change.

([**2177-7-17**]) Moderate left apical and medial pneumothorax has not
changed in volume over four hours, nor is there appreciable
atelectasis or pleural effusion. Right lung is grossly clear.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
defibrillator leads are in standard placements. Subsequent chest
radiographs performed over the next four and 13 hours
respectively show increase in the volume of the pneumothorax and
a small accompanying left pleural effusion.

([**2177-7-19**]) Tiny left apical pneumothorax is less conspicuous than
before. There are no other acute interval changes.

ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rate in 110s. Normal axis, no
evidence of active ischemia. Poor R-wave progression in
precordial leads.
.
- ECHO (TEE) [**2177-6-23**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets,
one arising from the ventricular surface (2mm) and one arising
from the aortic side (7mm) which are most consistent with
Lambl's excresences (normal variant). No paravalar abcess seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: There are two filamentous
strands on the aortic leaflets, one arising from the ventricular
surface (2mm) and one arising from the aortic side (7mm) which
are most consistent with Lambl's excresences (bland
non-infectious vegetations). No abcess seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

.
- HOLTER (45 HOURS, [**2177-5-13**]):
IMPRESSIONS: 1. A.Fib throughout recording, rate-controlled
(47-165  BPM; average 91 BPM), normal intervals; maximum pause
3.2 seconds. 2. Moderate amount of ventricular ectopy (VPBs, 2
couplets). 3. No ventricular a
