History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F w/hx of flash pulm edema, PVD, CAD who developed DOE a
week ago, then developed a nonproductive cough and some
orthopnea.  CXR done at the NH revealed bibasilar infiltrates
and she was placed on Bactrim.  Sputum cx was + for MRSA.  She
failed to improve on this regimen and continued to require
supplmental O2 and so was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
*
She was initially thought to have a pneumonia, and was begun on
vanc/levo/flagyl (given possibility of nosocomial infxn).  Her
CHF medications were held, as her creatinine had bumped and the
team felt she was dry.  Later that night, on the floor, she
became tachypneic and appeared to be in some degree of
respiratory distress.  Her oxygen saturation decreased from 94%
on 4L to 93% on 10L.  She received nebs and lasix 40 iv x1, with
100 cc UOP.

rehab for many months.

Right Cortical Atrophy
.
DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED  [**2161-12-16**]
The findings of unilateral small kidney with abnormal waveforms
are suggestive of renal artery stenosis on the right side. The
left kidney appears essentially normal.
.
ABDOMINAL A-GRAM  [**2161-12-18**]
Aortography demonstrated heavily calcified irregular aorta.
There was high-grade ostial stenosis of the left renal artery
with marked calcification at the origin. There was a moderate
stenosis of the right renal artery approximately 2 cm from the
origin. The origin of the right renal artery could not be
delineated. Right kidney was reduced in size. Left kidney
demonstrated normal size and perfusion. Selective renal
arteriogram was not performed.
