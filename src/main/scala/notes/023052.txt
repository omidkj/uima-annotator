Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
5.6 cm aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Retroperitoneal tube graft AAA repair

History of Present Illness:
She was found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm by CT scan
and she has been asymptomatic from the aneurysm, it was an
incidental find.  CT angiogram showed diffusely aneurysmal
infrarenal aortic segment with a large amount of mural thrombus
extending right up to the renal arteries. There is also ectasia
and mural thrombus in the suprarenal aorta.  The aneurysm
extends down to the aortic bifuration.  It is about 5.2cm in
maximal diameter.  The iliac arteries are somewhat calcified and
moderately ectatic

years.  She quit 7 years ago. No alcohol. She is a retired
nurse.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  700 cc.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

INDICATIONS:  This 88 year-old lady has a 5.6 cm aneurysm of
the infrarenal aorta. She has a history of a previous sigmoid
colectomy and with colostomy as well as abdominal radiation
for cancer of the rectum. She has had multiple small-bowel
obstructions.

PROCEDURE:  Under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia,
the patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus
position and after positioning the patient appropriately the
left flank and abdomen were prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. An oblique incision was made across the
flank into the left abdomen in the 11th interspace. The
intercostal and oblique muscles were divided and with some
difficulty due to the postop changes the retroperitoneal
space was entered posterior to the left kidney.

The [**Last Name (un) 24412**] retractor was placed after raising the kidney
and mobilizing the peritoneum anteriorly. The aorta was
exposed. We started the dissection at the left renal artery
which was carefully delineated. Working superior to the renal
artery, the crus of the diaphragm was incised and the celiac
and superior mesenteric arteries were identified. The best
area for clamping seemed to be above the renal arteries,
since the aneurysm extended right up to the renal arteries.
Dissection was then carried distally. The inferior mesenteric
artery was ligated. The ureter was mobilize to the right with
the peritoneum. There were marked inflammatory changes in the
pelvis which made dissection of the iliac arteries hazardous
and so no attempt was made to completely expose them. The
patient was then heparinized. The left and right renal
arteries and superior mesenteric artery were all encircled
with vessel loops. With these vessels controlled, a clamp was
placed on the aorta just above the renal arteries or below
the superior mesenteric artery.

Flow was then reestablished into the superior mesenteric
artery. A longitudinal aortotomy was then made. A large
amount of thrombus and atheromatous debris was removed. A
large aortic crossclamp was used on the distal aorta to
control backbleeding while the proximal anastomosis was done.
Some bleeding lumbar branches were oversewn with silk suture
ligatures after removal of calcific plaque over them. It
became apparent that the aneurysm actually terminated at the
level of the renal arteries. The aorta was transected
proximally except for the posterior wall. An 18-mm Dacron
graft was then taken. An end-to-end anastomosis was fashioned
between the graft and aorta with a running continuous suture
of 3-0 Prolene using the graft inclusion technique.  The
sutures came close to but did not impinge on the orifices of
the renal arteries which were carefully visualized.

Once this was done, the graft was copiously flushed and
clamped distal to the anastomosis and flow was reestablished
into both renal arteries. Warm ischemia time was 18 minutes.
Attention was turned distally. We opened the aorta the rest
of the way down after removing the clamp. There was very
brisk backbleeding from both iliac vessels. Balloon occlusion
was done from within the aortic sac using 4 mm [**Doctor Last Name **]
embolectomy catheters on 3-way stopcocks. Calcific plaque at
the bifurcation was then removed. The middle sacral artery
was oversewn with a silk suture ligature. The distal end of
the graft was trimmed and a second end-to-end anastomosis was
fashioned with running continuous suture of 3-0 Prolene,
again using the graft inclusion technique.

Prior to completing this anastomosis, the iliac vessels and
aorta were copiously flushed. Flow was reestablished by
compressing both femoral arteries in the groin as best as
possible. There was some drop in the blood pressure with
restoration of flow to about 85 mm systolic which responded
rapidly to blood replacement. Flow was allowed down into the
left lower extremity first and then the right lower extremity
with no further hemodynamic instability. Heparin was then
reversed with protamine. Doppler interrogation demonstrated
good flow in both renals and the superior mesenteric artery
and there were good pulses in the iliac vessels. The aorta
was closed over the graft with 3-0 Prolene. All packs and
retractors were then removed. The viscera was allowed to fall
back into their normal position. We had entered the pleural
cavity posteriorly. A 28 chest tube was placed just in the
interspace above our incision and connected to the Pleur-Evac
and sutured to the skin. The intercostals were reapproximated
with #1 PDS. The transversus abdominis and internal oblique
were approximated as 1 layer with a #1 PDS. The part of the
latissimus dorsi and the external oblique and anterior rectus
sheath were all closed as a single layer with a running
continuous suture of double-stranded #1 PDS. 2-0 Vicryl was
used to close the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed
with skin staples. A dry sterile dressing was applied. The
patient was returned to the supine position and palpation of
her extremities demonstrated palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.
She was then taken to the recovery room still intubated but
in stable condition. All counts were reported correct.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-8-8**] 9:07 AM

AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The right IJ line is in
unchanged position with the tip projecting over the mid SVC.
There is significant increase in opacity in the left mid and
lower lung fields, most likely representing collapse and/or
pleural effusion. Note is made of a narrowed left main stem
bronchus which may indicate luminal obstruction causing
collapse. The right lung remains clear. There has been interval
removal of the NG tube.

IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in left-sided pleural effusion and/or left lower
lobe collapse.
2. Removal of NG tube.
