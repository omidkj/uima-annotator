CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath, cough, and fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
female with past medical history of COPD, type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department in the afternoon of [**5-17**] with
the complaints of cough, fever, and shortness of breath x2
days.  The patient noted that cough was productive of yellow
sputum.  In ED, the patient was noted to be tachypneic and
tachycardiac with low-grade temperature of 100.6.  The
patient's O2 saturations were 95 percent on nonrebreather.
Chest x-ray disclosed left lower lobe consolidation.  The
patient was given dose of levofloxacin.  She was intubated
given worsening respiratory distress.  MAST protocol was
initiated.  When the labs came back showing lactate of 5.2
and white blood cell count of 33,000, the patient was given
IV fluid boluses and started on pressors.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, anxious appearing female in
respiratory distress.  Initial vital signs, temperature
100.6, heart rate 110 to 140, blood pressure 146/75, and
respiratory rate 18 to 28.  Initial oxygen saturation 96
percent on 3 liters.  HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Mucous membranes moist.  Neck:
Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac,
S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:  Crackles at
right base.  Decreased breath sounds at left base with
diffuse expiratory wheezes.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, and warm.  Neurological:
Alert, and oriented x 3.  Cranial nerves II through XII
grossly intact.  Exam is otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 33, hematocrit 40.5,
platelets 345, differential showed 62 percent neutrophils and
26 percent bands.  Chemistry:  Sodium of 135, potassium 3.1,
chloride 92, bicarbonates 19, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, with a
glucose of 152, anion gap was 24, calcium 8.6, phosphorus
2.4, magnesium 1.3, ALT 34, AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 158,
total bilirubin 2.3, amylase 20, lipase 10, and lactate 5.2.
Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained.  Radiology:
Chest x-ray, left lower lobe consolidations.  EKG:  Sinus
tachycardia at 140 with lateral T wave inversions.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 59-year-old female with a
history of COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and
diabetes type 2 presenting to ED with severe community
acquired pneumonia and septic shock.  The patient was
intubated in the emergency department given respiratory
failure.  MAST protocol initiated given the patient's fever,
leukocytosis, and elevated lactate of 5.2.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU for further management.

Septic shock.  As noted above, the patient met criteria for
MAST protocol.  Septic shock secondary to left lower lobe
pneumonia.  The patient was started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  She was administered aggressive IV fluids given
that her MAP was less than 65.  She was initiated on
pressors.  She was administered stress dose steroids.  On the
night of her admission, the patient experienced a PEA arrest
around 1 a.m., when she became progressively hypotensive and
did not have a pulse.  A CPR was initiated.  The patient was
administered 1 ampule of atropine, and 1 ampule of
epinephrine, and was administered further fluids.  Within 10
minutes, the patient's blood pressure returned and her rhythm
was sinus tachycardia.  The patient remained on Lopressor for
the remainder of her hospitalization.

Respiratory failure secondary to community acquired
pneumonia.  As noted above, the patient was continued on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.  She was also administered
steroids and bronchodilators.  She was managed on the
ventilator with efforts to pursue a long protective
ventilation strategy.

Cardiovascular.  Following the patient's PEA arrest on the
night of her admission, her cardiac enzymes were elevated
thought to be secondary to a low flow state in the setting of
her code.

Hepatitis.  On the morning following the patient's PEA
arrest, LFTs were elevated thought to be secondary to shock
liver.

Coagulopathy.  The patient was noted to have prolonged PTT
and there was concern for DIC.

Neurologic.  On the morning following the patient's PEA
arrest, she was noted to have anisocoria.  The patient was
not deemed stable for head imaging.  There was concern for
neurologic compromise.

Code status.  The patient's family was involved in numerous
discussions regarding the patient's poor prognosis over the
course of the night on [**5-17**] and during the day on [**5-18**]
given our concern for neurologic and cardiovascular
compromise and the patient's worsening respiratory status.
It was determined that CPR was not indicated.  The patient
continued to deteriorate and required 4 pressors.  Her
temperature spiked to 107 despite antibiotics and attempts
like cooling.  In light of these developments, the family
decided to withdraw therapy and re-institute comfort
measures.  At 8:34 p.m. on [**5-18**], the patient expired
following extubation.  The patient's family was at the
bedside.  Request for autopsy was declined.
