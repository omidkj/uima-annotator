   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2134-7-1**]):
      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA
      amplification assay.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

CXR [**6-13**]
Moderate right pleural effusion with right lung base
consolidation. Smaller opacification likely pneumonia at the
left upper lobe.  Repeat imaging to document resolution after
treatment.
.
U/S [**6-14**]
Satisfactory morphologic appearance of both kidneys with no
evidence of
hydronephrosis, renal mass or shadowing calculi.
The bladder is empty containing an indwelling Foley catheter.
.
ECHO [**2134-6-16**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small,
predominantly anterior pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No
IMPRESSION: Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No significant valvular disease. No valvular
vegetations identified.
.
KUB [**2134-6-16**]
IMPRESSION:  Paucity of abdominal gas without evidence of toxic
megacolon.
.
U/S [**6-19**]
1.  Distended gallbladder containing layering sludge without
definite stones.  No gallbladder wall edema.  Though no specific
signs of cholecystitis are present, acute acalculous
cholecystitis cannot be excluded.
2.  Uniform dilation of the extrahepatic common duct, up to 1.0
cm, to the
level of the pancreatic head, below which the duct is not seen
well.  MRCP may be helpful for further evaluation if there is
clinical concern. If not
obtained LFTs should be followed.
3.  Small amount of ascites.
.
DOPPLER U/S
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  Cephalic vein
(superficial) thrombosis at the level of the antercubital fossa.

.
CXR [**7-1**]
There is a new tracheostomy tube in standard position.  Right IJ
catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild vascular
congestion is increased.  Bibasilar opacities are unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also stable.  There is no
evident pneumothorax.  The opacities in the lower lobes may
reflect atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be
totally excluded.
.
MRI [**2134-6-30**]
FINDINGS:  Diffusion images demonstrate multiple small areas of
restricted
diffusion in both cerebral hemispheres, predominantly in the
subcortical white matter in the periventricular region including
involvement of the left side of the corpus callosum suggestive
of acute infarcts.  There are no acute infarcts seen in the
brainstem or cerebellum.  Mild brain atrophy is seen.  Mild
changes of small vessel disease identified.  Small amount of
fluid is seen in the left sphenoid sinus and bilateral mastoid
air cells.  There is no evidence of chronic microhemorrhages.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple acute subcortical infarction in both
cerebral
hemispheres as described above.  No mass effect or
hydrocephalus.

EEG [**6-29**]
This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of
intermittent runs of bifrontocentral rhythmic slowing. In
addition,
there is excess slow activity admixed with background. These
findings
