History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 49M with medical history of type I diabetes,
narcotics abuse, hypertension presented to [**Hospital3 **]hospital on [**2129-11-18**] after several day history of nausea and
vomiting. Per the wife who had spoken with him over phone daily
prior to hospitalization, he had been sick to his stomach on
Wednesday and thursday with poor po intake. He sounded confused
and short of breath on the phone. Not clear if fever or chills
or diarrhea. Of note, the patient obtained a perocet rx on
wednesday [**11-16**] for #30 tablets that was supposed to last 10
days but by Friday all the tablets were gone (of note two weeks
prior very depressed, sent to [**Hospital1 **]? psychiatric unit, from
there went to day program [? drug recovery] in [**Location (un) 1157**]
although not clear that going).
.
In the ED, initial vitals were BP 215/78 HR:107, RR 24, O2 96%
NRB. WBC of 24.4, HCT of 37.8, platelets 327. Glucose of 581,
anion gap of 23, urine with positive ketones. Na 136, K 5.5, Cr
1.4. EKG sinus tachycardia with rate of 116, CK 165 and troponin
I of 0.05. Blood gas 7.31/29/96 15 on NRB. CXR read as bilateral
upper lobe infiltrates suspicious for pulmonary edema,
pneumonia, or both. CT head with no abnormality except for air
fluid level in maxillary sinus consistent with sinusitis. He was
given ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected pneumonia,
insulin gtt and 2L IVF and admitted to the ICU.
.
The patient was maintained on an insulin gtt until his anion gap
closed after which he was transitioned on [**2129-11-19**] to his daily
lantus and insulin sliding scale with FS in 200s. He developed
worsening respiratory distress with repeat ABG showing hypoxemic
respiratory failure with PO2 of 35 and was intubated on
[**2129-11-19**]. Chest x-ray reported showed pulmonary edema and he was
given lasix 40mg IVx2 with good response. Looks like antibiotics
changed from ceftriaxone/azithro to levaquin on [**11-20**]. Vent
settings on tranfer AC TV 400, 65% FiO2, PEEP 10. Today temp of
101.3, has been hemodynamically stable with BP 132/50 HR 70s.
Was given lasix 40IV and has put out 1300cc. Has 2PIV (20 in R
foot and 20 in L forearm). Labs on transfer ([**11-20**]) sodium 143,
K 4.0, Chloride 112, CO2 26, anion gap 9, Cr 1.1, BUN 21,
calcium 7.2, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 2.9, BNP 1190 ([**11-20**]).

Pertinent Results:
[**11-21**] CXR:
The decreased radiodensity of widespread heterogeneous pulmonary
consolidation
may be due to decrease in edema, but the abnormality itself is
still
concerning for widespread pneumonia. Careful followup advised.
No pleural
effusion, mediastinal widening, cardiomegaly or vascular
congestion. ET tube
in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the region of
pylorus. No
pneumothorax. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4587**] and I discussed the findings and their
clinical
significance over the telephone at the time of dictation.

.
Microbiology: Ucx, Bcx, Sputum Cx were all NTD at time of
discharge
.
Urine legionella was negative. Stool for C.dif toxins was
negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
49M with history of type I diabetes, hypertension presented with
nausea found to be in DKA, hypoxic respiratory failure likely
secondary to pneumonia and course complicated by DKA who was
initially admitted to the ICU.
.
#HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  CXR on admission equivocal for
multifocal PNA vs. pleural effusions. He has been treated for
both with antibiotics (broadened to vancomycin, zosyn, and
azithromycin) as well as IV lasix diuresis complicated by
hypernatremia.  TTE showing preserved EF and therefore unlikely
to be cardiogenic.. Patient was successfully extubated and
tolerated room air/NC well,with no tachypnea and oxygen
saturations above 95
