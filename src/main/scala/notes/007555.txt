History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old female with a history of coronary
artery disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial
fibrillation and COPD on home oxygen who presented to [**Hospital **] on [**2154-11-4**] after being found down in a shelter
unresponsive. Per notes, she had been staying at a shelter
because her power was out in her home. She was found
unresponsive and was bradycardic to the 20s and hypotensive. She
was taken to [**Hospital3 7569**] where she had an emergent
temporary transvenous pacer placed. She also was intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure. The initial cause of her
bradycardiac was unclear but felt possibly to be related to
digoxin toxicity for which she received digibind. She was
subsequently treated for a COPD exacerbation with high dose
solumedrol, zosyn and azithromycin. She also was noted to have
acute renal failure thought by nephrology to be consistent with
acute tubular necrosis in the setting of profound hypotension
and was treated with lasix for decreased urine ouput. There was
also concern for gastrointestinal bleeding as her hematocrit on
presentation was 19.4 and she received two units of packed red
blood cells. She was extubated on hospital day two without
difficulty. She had an echocardiogram which showed preserved
systolic function but pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary
artery pressure of 50 mm. The Zosyn was discontinued when the
patient began to experience a drop in her platelet count to as
low as 56k. On hospital day three she underwent a thoracentesis
for a left sided pleural effusion which was consistent with a
transudate with LDH 88, ratio 0.3, Prot 3.0. She continued to
have loose black guaiac positive stools. She was started on IV
flagyl and PO vancomycin out of concern for clostridium
difficile although c. diff samples were negative x 1. Renal
function has improved from a creatinine of 2.6 on admission to
1.7. She also suffered from a burn to her back from a heating
pad used while she had the transvenous pacer placed and
developed a stage II decubitous ulcer. The temporary pacer was
removed prior to transfer.

On arrival here the patient noted that she has been experiencing
chest tightness since her endotracheal tube was removed. On
arrival her heart rate was in the 140s in atrial fibrillation
with blood pressures in the 160s systolic. She had a
nitroglycerin patch on and it was unclear whether this was being
used for chest pain or for blood pressure control. She received
5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 with good control of her heart rate.

She currently denies lightheadedness or dizziness. She continues
to experience chest tightness. Her breathing feels at baseline
to her. She endorses mild nausea but no vomiting. She denies
abdominal pain but endorses dark stools with diarrhea. She
denies dysuria, hematuria or decreased urine output. She denies
leg pain or swelling. She does note that she was admitted to
[**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year with gastrointestinal bleeding and
had a procedure but she does not recall what was found. All
other review of systems negative in detail.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CARDIAC ECHO [**2154-11-12**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease s/p
CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and COPD on
home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred for
management of gastrointestinal bleeding which resolved; also
with failure to extubate s/p trach and thrombocytopenia.
Patient was discharged to a respiratory rehab facility in fair
condition.

# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was transiently
intubated at the OSH prior to transfer for hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  She had been extubated since [**2154-11-5**] and
doing well.  She is on 3L nasal cannula at home.  Here her ABG
[**Last Name (un) **] worsening hypercarbia and she was felt to have pulmonary
edema and possibly and aspiration event so was reintubated and
started on vanc and meropenem.  Reinitated solumedrol at 40mg
[**Hospital1 **] which were eventually tapered (her last dose of steroids was
[**11-20**]).  Continued on atrovent q4h.  She was extubated on [**11-10**]
and placed on noninvasive ventilation for hypoxemia in setting
of pulmonary edema, however she had to be reintubated.  She was
found to have a VAP and was treated with Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for an 8-day
course (end date [**11-17**]).  After failing multiple extubation
attempts a trachestomy was placed and patient was discharged to
a [**Hospital 38763**] rehab facility.

# Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Patient had been having dark guaiac
positive stools since admission to [**Location (un) **]. Her hematocrit on
admission was 19.4 and per reports she r
