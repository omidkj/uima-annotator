Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2499**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 60F with ER negative, Her-2/neu positive breast
cancer with mets to lymph node, pericardium, spleen, and bone
who was recently receiving chemoradiation at which time she
became short of breath and was found to have laryngeal edema and
vocal cord paralysis. She was admitted to the ICU where she had
a trach placed, a chest tube placed for a large Left pleural
efusion and a pericardial window for malignant pericardial
effusion with a pulsus paradoxus of 15 to 20 prior to
pericardiocentesis and window. After resolution of these
problems (see hospital course) , due to the progressive nature
of her disease despite recent therapy with radiation to her left
brachial plexus and xeloda and herceptin, she was transferred to
the oncology service for additional chemotherapy with Adriamycin
and Cytoxan. On arrival to the floor, the patient had a pulsus
of 10.

Radiology:
[**2137-10-9**]: CT Chest - 1. Improvement to prior multifocal ground
glass opacity and consolidation, but new right perihilar
consolidations.  Temporal context and behavior of these findings
are most suggestive of drug reaction, atypical edema, or
pulmonary hemorrhage. Infectious process is felt to be unlikely.
2.  Early development of fibrotic changes in the upper lobes,
supportive of drug toxicity scenario. 3.  Small pericardial
effusion, increased from prior exam.
.
[**2137-10-3**]: CT Chest - 1.  Acute pulmonary embolism in the right
lower lobe pulmonary artery extending into the segmental and
subsegmental branches. There is mild compression of the right
lower lobe pulmonary artery superior to the filling defect
secondary to right hilar lymphadenopathy. As the size of the
filling defect is larger than the narrowed lumen of the artery
proximally, an element of thrombus is also likely present.
Subsegmental pulmonary emboli are also demonstrated within the
right upper lobe and right middle lobe pulmonary arterial
branches.
2.  Stable appearance of the lungs with multiple areas of ground
glass opacity and consolidation predominantly in the peripheral
and peribronchial distribution.  No new areas of consolidation
are demonstrated. 3.  Stable bilateral axillary, hilar, and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 4.  Unchanged appearance of low
density lesion in the right love of the liver. 5. Stable
appearance of loculated, moderate in size left pleural effusion.

.
[**2137-10-2**]: LE US - IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower extremity deep
vein thromboses, right greater than left, age indeterminate.
.
[**2137-10-1**]: CT Chest without contast: 1)  Multifocal areas of
ground glass and consolidation in peripheral and peribronchial
distribution.  Rapid progression and development of these
findings favors an inflammatory or infectious etiology such as
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or
fungal infection.  Less likely considerations include vasculitis
or drug reaction. Rapid progression argues against a neoplastic
process. 2)  New porta hepatis and celiac axis lymph nodes, and
mild enlargement of right axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes.
3) Moderate loculated lef
