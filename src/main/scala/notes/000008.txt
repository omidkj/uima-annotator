INTERPRETATION

Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: an
immature population of cells consistent with acute myelogenous
leukemia.  Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) 40124**] to be consistent with
a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Correlation with
morphologic and cytogenetic findings is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o M presenting after syncopal episode found to have
multiple small ICH and new pancytopenia.  Had complicated course
of AMPL treatment

# Leukemia: Patient found to have AMPL via bone marrow biopsy
the day of admission to the MICU.  He was started on ATRA and
monitored closely for symptoms of DIC, TLS and ATRA syndrome.
He was transfused as needed with PRBC, platlets and FFP.  He did
not develop overt signs of DIC.  He was induced with Ara-c and
daunurubicin.  His counts responded appropriatly.  A repeat BM
biopsy showed remission and he will continue the ATRA for now
and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for plans of stage two of his
treatment.
.
# Fevers: He initially was on Vancomycin and cefepime when first
starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home, but as his
culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his
antibiotics were discontinued.  He remained afebrile until [**4-14**]
when he spiked a fever.  He was cultured and his blood grew
strep viridans.  He was started on vanco/cefepime at that time.
He also had a headache the day he spiked and a CT was done
showing what appeared to be brain abscesses.  His antibiotics
were eventually broadened to vanco, meropenem, fluconzaole and
flagyl for the brain abscesses.  He continued to spike, though
for approximately a week.  He complained of some thigh pain and
we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections.  They
were drained in IR and grew MSSA.  He then developed a pneumonia
during his febr
