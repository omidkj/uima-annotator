Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65F with history of multiple falls thought to be
secondary to polypharmacy and concomitant alcohol use who was
initially admitted to MICU for hyponatremia. Patient was found
to have stable non-displaced occipital bone fracture, bifrontal
hemorrhagic contusions, and subdural hematomas on head CT. Her
hyponatremia was determined to be from SIADH based on urine and
serum chemistries. Chest CT was negative for pulmonary neoplasm.

.
Regarding the fall, patient was unable to give more details
about the fall but knew that she fell backwards and landed on
the back of her head. On admission, she denied loss of
consciousness or antecedent chest pressure, shortness of breath,
or palpitations.

[**2169-5-19**] CT Head:
1. Bilateral frontal hemorrhagic contusions as described above.
2. Small right frontal and right posterior parafalcine subdural
hematomas.
3. Suggestion of a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage
within the left parietal lobe.
3. Old lacunar infarcts within the thalami bilaterally.
4. Fluid level within the left maxillary sinus and left sphenoid
sinus. Although no definite fracture is identified within this
region, a CT sinus study is recommended to evaluate for subtle
fractures.
.
[**2169-5-19**] CT Spine:
1. No acute fracture identified in cervical spine. Diffuse
degenerative changes noted.
2. Diffuse emphysematous changes at the lung apices.
3. Occipital bone fracture.
.
[**2169-5-20**] CR sinus:
No acute facial fractures identified. Intracranial hemorrhage
and occipital bone fracture better demonstrated on the head CT
of the same day.
.
[**2169-5-20**] CT Chest:
1. No CT evidence of lung parenchymal mass to suggest a primary
lung cancer.
2. Dependent secretions within the main bronchi and extensive
impaction of left lower lobe bronchi as described. Although the
left lower lobe is currently well aerated, the patient is at
risk for postobstructive collapse.
3. Incompletely imaged left perinephric fluid without
identifiable renal parenchymal abnormality. Dedicated renal
ultrasound may be considered for more complete evaluation of
this region if warranted clinically, as communicated to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone on [**2169-5-20**].
.
[**2169-5-20**] RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 8.6 cm.
The left kidney measures 10.1 cm. There is no hydronephrosis,
stones, or masses. There are no perinephric fluid collections.
.
MRI Cervical Spine:
No evidence of ligamentous disruption, fracture or malalignment
seen. Multilevel degenerative changes. The signal changes at
C5-6 levels secondary to endplate degeneration.
.
Other significant labs:

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65F with fibromyalgia, multiple falls, now with bilateral
frontal hemorrhagic contusions and hyponatremia.
.
# Hyponatremia - Patient not obtunded; does have some difficulty
with memory and concentration, which could be due to her chronic
hemorrhages. Hyponatremia is from dehydration and SIADH,
possibly from intracranial hemorrhage. Urine osms in 500s with
serum osms in 200s is consistent with SIADH - should be making
hypotonic urine in response to hyponatremia. Chest CT negative
for lung mass.  Patient improved on free water restriction to
1.2L/day and giving NS IVF.
.
# s/p fall - pt has had extensive workup for falls, polypharmacy
including sedating meds, as well as alcohol, felt to be part of
the issue. Pt has been seen by behavioral neurology for falls.
She was monitored on fall precautions. PT/OT was consulted.

Regarding the cervical spine; no acute fracture on CT C spine,
which showed DJD but not fracture.  Ortho-spine (Dr.[**Name (NI) 12040**]
team) had an MRI done to rule out small fractures and
ligamentous injury. She was then cleared.  She may wear a soft
collar for comfort.  She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] as
needed for pain in her arms or neck.
.
# Frontal hemorrhagic contusions, acute on [**Last Name (un) **] SDH -
Neurosurgery was consulted and felt no intervention was
indicated.  She was started on phenytoin for seizure
prophylaxis, which needs to be followed while at rehab and then
by her [**Last Name (un) 850**] and the neurosurgeon, (Please see
appointments and medications).
.
# EtOH abuse: Does endorse EtOH use. change in mental status
could also be withdrawal from her various pain meds/sedatives.
She was followed with CIWA scale with valium prn, but did not
require it.  Started thiamine, folate discontinued in setting of
phenytoin treatment. Patient written for 0.5mg of ativan Q6PRN
for anxiety.
.
# chronic pain/fibromyalgia - cont with outpt regimen of ultram,
trazodone.  Patient started on remeron 15mg QHS to assist with
depression, anorexia. Consider restarting nortriptyline,
topamax.  Avoid narcotics.
.
# hypertension - Patient had atenolol and lisinopril held.  BP
were well controlled to 130-150 systolic.
.
# emphysema - Continued advair
.
# FEN/GI - Regular diet with strawberry boost with daily
chemistries
- free water (not including IVF which are NS) restrict to 1.5L
- monitor electrolytes
- Please continue 1.5L of NS/day (can give during day).
.
# anemia - Patient had slowly decreasing hct over stay, no
obvious signs of bleeding, guiaic negative. Most likely
secondary to aggressive hydration and frequent phlebotomy.
Anemia studies pending at discharge.
.
# PPx - pneumoboots, PPI
