Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of temporary dialysis catheter
PICC line placement right upper arm
Left wrist arthrocentesis


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 year old female with a past medical history
of longstanding right heart failure with severe right
ventricular contractile dysfunction and severe tricuspid
regurgitation, atrial fibrillation not on warfarin due to GI
bleed in [**2107**] but no known history of coronary artery disease
who presents from home with several weeks of progressively
worsening lower extremity edema and fatigue.
.
She has longstanding right sided heart failure, which in the
past has been refractory to  diuresis and during a previous
admission in [**2108-3-21**] required ultrafiltration due to poor
response to IV diuresis. At the time, she was diagnosed with a
PFO and left-to-right shunting that was percutaneously closed on
[**2108-3-14**].  Her most recent RHC was on [**2108-3-23**] and showed no
shunt, RAP 30 mmHg, mean PAP 38 mmHg, and wedge pressure 30
mmHg.  At the time, ultrafiltation resulted in improved forward
flow and improvement in renal function.  CT chest in the past
was negative for thromboemboli.
.
She appears to have been fairly well compensated over the past
18 months, on medical therapy (torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **], metoprolol
25mg [**Hospital1 **], spironolactone 25mg daily) without hospitalization.
However, over the last 2-3 weeks, she has noted significantly
worsening lower extremity edema (legs doubling in size),
fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and poor urine output, despite
minimal diet changes and medication compliance. She reports
mechanical fall this past Friday landing on her right side
(knee, shoulder). Following this she took 4 tablets of
ibuprofen. Reports dry weight in 140lb range, currently 185lbs.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.5 58 83/45 (basline early
[**Month (only) **] ~100-110 systolic) 28 100% RA. Systolic blood pressure
transiently down to the high 60s. Exam notable for 4+ bilateral
lower extremity edema, sacral edema, JVP to jaw, clear lungs.
Labs notable for creatinine of 6.7 (baseline of ~1.5), sodium
131, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 13476**] (was 6666 in [**2108**]), troponin of 0.03, lactate
1.2. CXR showed cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural
effusions. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, rate 65, RBBB,
unchanged compared to prior. Echocardiogram showed RV dilatation
and hypokinesis,4+ TR and failure of the TV leaflets to coapt,
LVEF  still preserved at >55% with moderate MR (unchanged
compared to prior). She was given 250cc IVF initially for
hypotension but cardiology fellow stopped. She was given 80IV
lasix total. Vitals on trasfer: 97.8 56 98/48 16 94 2LNC.  Has
2PIV for access. Foley catheter placed after multiple attempts.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
