Radiologic Studies:
------------------
[**4-1**] CXR: No focal pneumonic consolidation. Subtle interstitial
and nodular pattern may represent atypical or miliary type
infection given the history of recent chemotherapy and probable
immunosuppression

[**4-2**]    RADIOLOGY  Final Report

Slight increase in opacity in the right lower lobe represents
increasing atelectasis/consolidation. Persistent subtle
reticulonodular pattern throughout both lung fields. If further
characterization is desired, a CT scan is recommended

[**4-2**] Echo

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

[**4-3**] Abdominal MRI

REPORT: The patient has diffuse metastatic disease, with
pulmonary, soft tissue, hepatic, renal and bone marrow
metastases being seen.

The liver is diffusely replaced by hepatic metastases. The liver
is also enlarged. The metastases are causing marked compression
of the intrahepatic IVC. The intrahepatic IVC, however, does
appear to be patent. Note is made of attenuation of the
posterior branch of the right portal vein ,but this remains
patent. The left hepatic vein, however, is occluded throughout
its proximal extent. In the lateral segment of the left lobe, it
may be partially patent. No other vascular occlusion is noted.

CONCLUSION:
Extensive metastatic disease.

Markedly compressed, but patent IVC.

Markedly compressed, but patent intrahepatic portal vein,
particularly the posterior branch of the right portal vein.

Partial thrombosis of left hepatic vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:

Admitted to ICU for sepsis monitoring on MUST protocol for
lactate >4. He was aggressively IVF repleted to maintain CVP >8,
and mixed venous O2 was maintained >70%. He never required
pressor support or intubation. His random cortisol was normal at
36. Given his localizing symptoms of cough and positive CXR for
atypical pneumonia he was treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin empirically. In addition blood, urine, sputum and
stool cultures were sent for infectious work-up. His lactate
improved overnight to 4.0 and he remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable. Therefore he was transfered to the
general medicine service on hospital day 2.

after being transferred to medicine main issue were as follows:
.

1. PNA: imaging seemed consistent with atypical pna with
ceftriaxone (which would also cover urinary source as well) and
azithromycin.  Urinary legionella ag was negative.  However, on
repeat imaging a consolidation became apparent and patient
sputum cultures grew staph aureus. He was started on vancomycin
and then switched to oxacillin when his cultures grew MSSA.
Urine cultures and blood cultures showed no growth at the time
of this dc summary. White count continued to increase into the
30's- likley from bm involvement of tumor (was seen on mri).
.
2.SOB: Patient continued to complain of some sob and dyspnea,
though to be likely from pna and mets, patient was continued on
oxygen with close monitoring
.
3. metastatic melanoma: very poor prognosis. Dacarbazine
response rate is 10-20% of pt's with this severity of dz and
subsequent interleukin-2 (which pt is already too ill for) only
has 10% response rate as well. Dacarbazine could be source of
fever as well (flu-like symptoms seen in [**12-1**]% of cases) and
source of elevated LFTs. We expected counts to nadir in [**5-31**]
days from chemo ([**3-26**]).  Given his poor prognosis and tenous
clinical status, code status was readdressed, and patient was
made dnr/dni.  Patient clinical status continued to decline (see
below) and he was made cmo (see below)
.
4. Abdominal distention/LE edema/ liver failure- Patient
continued to complain of abdominal distenstion and he had a
transaminitis, with elevated ldh, alk phos, and t bili. It was
suspected that this was due to his liver mets and perhaps
compression/obstruction of biliary ducts and vascular system.
Given his abdominal distension there was a question of ascites.
(originally the possibility of sbp was addressed but patient
abdomen was nontender and in the [**Hospital Unit Name **] the team felt it was
unlikely to be the cause of his symptoms). He also had extensive
lower extremity edema and there was concern of ivc comprssion.
An ultrasound was obtained to eval portal/ivc flow and see i
