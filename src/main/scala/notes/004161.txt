History of Present Illness:
HPI:
60 F with h/o celiac disease, partial colectomy, presents for
continued weight loss, albumin 1.1, anorexia, further eval of
celiac disease by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1356**], GI [**Hospital1 18**].  Patient has had
diarrhea and GI discomfort for the past 25 yrs per pt, and was
diagnosed with celiac disease in [**2124**] during a colectomy at [**Hospital1 2025**].
.
Over the past 2-3 months, the patient feels that she has
progressively deteriorated.  Over this time, the patient has had
progressively more diarrhea, runny, brown, no blood, no mucus,
but she has progressively not been able to control the diarrhea
and has had increasing bouts of stool incontinence, for which
she now requires a diaper at all times.  She has never seen
blood in her stool and has only seen black stool when taking
iron.  She has diffuse abdominal pain intermittently with eating
too much, or with 3rd spacing in abdominal area.  Her PO intake
of food and fluid has not been decreasing dramatically, but she
has been losing weight.  Her legs, arms, buttock areas, backs of
her legs, and abdomen have become more swollen with fluid.
.
Patient was on TPN at OSH through RIJ.  RIJ line was inserted on
[**10-4**] (dressing was changed on [**10-16**]).  Patient briefly received
prednisone, but this was for a rash from presumptive OsCal
allergy.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital on [**10-2**] with
N/V/SOB/CP, was diagnosed with pna and UTI, placed on
ceftriaxone, improved.  Ruled out for MI by enzymes, EKG had TWI
inferiorly.
.
Patient has been admitted for further assessment of her celiac
disease by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1356**].  Concern at OSH has been for celiac
disease vs. malignancy vs. anorexia (psych) vs amyloid.  Had
screening mammogram and abd CT as outpatient that were normal.
Patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8671**] (GI consult at LMH) but has
yet to have had endoscopy (upper or lower).  LMH does not have
push enteroscopy capabilities so as to obtain a SB sample as
they were hoping for to r/o lymphoma. They were planning on
colonoscopy (r/o malignancy) and rectal bx (r/o amyloid), when
patient requested coming to a tertiary center to have extensive
work-up.
