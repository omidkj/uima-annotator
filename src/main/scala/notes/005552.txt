Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency,
Obstructing right uric acid stone, Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Right Internal Jugular Central Line
Right Ureteral Stent

History of Present Illness:
70 yo male with three vessel CABG ([**2147**] following anterior wall
MI and cardiac arrest) and ICD implantation, CHF (EF: 25% sp MI,
40% on [**11-19**]), DM, CRI, uric acid stones.
.
Patient presented to Wakefeild/[**Location (un) **] on [**2162-11-18**] under the
urology service for treatment of kidney stones for which he had
been diagnosed earlier in the week. Pt initially complained of
right-sided lower abdominal pain and flank tenderness. Patient
was sent home from Dr.[**Name (NI) 18722**] (urology) office and passed two
stones the Sunday prior to presentation. By the following
Tuesday the patient represented  to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] given severe
right lower abdominal/groin pain. On presentation patient's
kidney function was noticed to be increased from his baseline
creatinine of 1.8 to 2.4. He was admitted for pain control and
further management of renal calculi/renal insufficiency. CT
abdomen was performed on [**2162-11-18**] which showed right ureter 7mm
stone with mild to moderate distention. Planned for ESWL vs.
Stent placement. However patient became hypoxic and these
interventions were delayed. Patient was given IVF and pain
controlled. Renal was contulted and thought that worsening renal
function was secondary obstruction and ATN in the setting of
NSAID use.
.
Patient was receiving dilaudid for pain control and became
somnolent on [**2162-11-18**] and had a syncopal event. Patient was
given narcan and ICD evaluated without event appreciated. On
[**11-19**] patient became increasingly hypoxic and required transfer
to the ICU for BiPAP intermittently.  Also started on lasix gtt
with good response. EKG without evidence of ischemia. CXR with
cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement concerning for CHF
exacerbation. CAT scan of chest on [**2162-11-19**] revealed diffuse
patchy airspace aopacities of nonspecific etiology.
.
Pt also with low grade temperaures 99-100 WBC count up to [**Numeric Identifier 7923**].
Patient started on ceftriaxone given concern for infection.
Urine cultures were no growth. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for
further evaluation of hypoxia, intervention for renal calculi.
Vitals prior to transfer: Temp 98.6, 72, 19, 122/54, 93% on 6
liters.
.
In the intensive care unit, patient continues to note mild right
lower quadrant pain and nausea.

Studies:
.
CT Chest Abdomen
COMPARISON: Outside hospital CT abdomen [**2162-11-20**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT helical images were acquired through the chest,
abdomen and
pelvis without intravenous contrast. IV contrast was deferred
given the
patient's elevated creatinine of 3.7. Sagittal and coronal
reformats were
generated and reviewed.

FINDINGS:

CT OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube ends approximately 5 cm
above the
carina. A left chest wall pacemaker is present with two leads
terminating in
the right ventricle. The nasogastric tube ends in the body of
the stomach.
There are multifocal nodular opacities seen in the right and
left upper lobes,
which may represent an acute infectious process. These are
improved since the
prior study. Bilateral small pleural effusions are present, with
associated
compressive atelectasis of both lower lobes, right greater than
left.

No significant axillary lymphadenopathy is detected. Multiple
prominent
mediastinal lymph nodes are seen in the right paratracheal
region, prevascular
and para-aortic region measuring up to a maximum of 12 mm.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Within the
limitations of a
non-contrast study, the liver, the gallbladder, the spleen,
adrenal glands are
unremarkable. There is mild right hydronephrosis, which is not
significantly
changed since the prior study. A right ureteric stent is in
stable position,
terminating in the bladder. Assessment of stent patency cannot
be performed
in this study. The left kidney is stable in appearance, with
tiny
non-obstructive calculi in the lower pole. The stomach, small
and large bowel
are unremarkable. There is no intra-abdominal free fluid or air.
Multiple
small lymph nodes are seen in the retroperitoneum, measuring up
to a maximum
of 7 mm in short axis, and are not enlarged to CT limits of
significant
adenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary
bladder is empty
with a Foley catheter in place. The distal end of right ureteric
stent is in
the bladder. There is no left hydroureteronephrosis. A rectal
tube is in
place. The sigmoid colon is unremarkable except for mild
diverticulosis,
without evidence of acute diverticulitis. No significant pelvic
lymphadenopathy or free fluid is detected.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious
for infection
or malignancy are detected. Mild multilevel degenerative changes
of the
thoracolumbar spine are present. The patient is status post CABG
with
multiple intact sternotomy wires.

IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions, with associated
compressive
atelectasis of the lung bases. Multifocal nodular opacities in
both upper
lobes, likely infectious in etiology. These have slightly
improved since the
earlier CT of [**2162-11-19**]. Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph
nodes, likely
reactive.

2. Mild right hydronephrosis, stable in ap
