History of Present Illness:
76M complicated past medical history including CAD status post
CABG, s/p stents [**Month (only) **]/[**2122**] (on aspirin and plavix), status post
biologic AVR, CHF with EF 35-40 %, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on coumadin (now off secondary to recent epistaxis
requiring blood transfusion), history of strokes, CKD (baseline
Cr 2.5) with recent kidney injury thought to be secondary to AIN
from naficllin requiring hemodialysis, now off. He presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with lethargy. Patient states that he awoke this
morning feeling unwell. He had no specific or localizing signs.

He was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 4103**] on the [**Hospital **] Rehab
Facility 3 days prior to presentation. He had been there since
an admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for MSSA bacteremia complicated by what
appears to be acute kidney injury from acute interstitial
nephritis thought to be secondary to nafcillin. He also
developed diffuse skin vasculitis at that time.  He had been on
steroids which had been tapered to off about 2 weeks ago.  He
has also had intermittent delirium and volume overload.  It
appears an NSTEMI also complicated his course.

He had an episode of epistaxis for which he was admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] from [**1-1**] to [**1-3**] with an INR greater than 10 at the
time.  He is no longer on Coumadin but he is on aspirin and
Plavix.  He has had no further bleeding.  He has also had recent
transaminitis thought to be secondary to amiodarone and statin.
He had had a right upper quadrant ultrasounds which did not
reveal acute cholecystitis but did show gallstones in the
gallbladder.  His amiodarone has been discontinued but it
appears he is back on his simvastatin.

At [**Hospital1 **], the patient complained of pain in his penis from
Foley catheter insertion in the emergency department.

He denies shortness of breath, fever, chills, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain.  He notes a mild
nonproductive cough over the last few days.  He reports his
white blood cell count has been elevated intermittently in the
past.  It was elevated at NewBridge; however, repeat was normal
and he was sent home.

Per his wife he had an episode of confusion in the morning with
some
urinary incontinence.  He is now back at his baseline.  He is
AAOx3.

It was also noted that he has had recent increase in lower
extremity edema which was thought to be secondary to his
prednisone. His lasix was increased to 80 mg PO BID from 40 mg
PO BID about a week and a half ago. His lower extremities have
improved in terms of swelling. He also reports improvement of
the vasculitic rash now scabbing.

For his diabetes, his lantus was recently increased from 22
units to 26 units as he has been having elevated blood glucose
which began at NewBridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **].

In the ER at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have acute renal
injury with Cr of 3.1 (baseline ~ 2.5) as well as hyperkalemia
(K 6.1). He was treated with 8 units of IV insulin, Kayexalate,
and calcium gluconate. He was also given 2.5 L of IVF per
records.

CXR was felt to show possible left lower infiltrate. He was
given levofloxacin and vancomycin.

Studies were significant for:

Na 132 K 6.1, Cl 99, HCO3 26, BUN 71, Cr 3.1, Glc 355
WBC 16.6(H), Hct 30.6, Plt 376 MCV 81 with Diff N 77, M 13
INR 1.4
ALT 282, AST 533, ALP 618, Tbili 0.68, albumin 2.1
CK 56, Troponin 0.65 BNP 33,541
Lactate 2.7
UA: Blood moderate, nitrate, LE negative, RBC [**4-27**], WBC 0-2, Occ
epi
EKG: NSR at 77 bpm, PR prolongation, RBBB. No acute ST-T changes

CXR: Poor quality. Increased density in inferior portion of
chest on lateral view likely represents pleural fluid, probably
on the right, prominent cardiac silhouette
Head CT (prelim): Left maxillary sinus disease. No acute
intracranial pathology.
RUQ US (prelim): No [**Doctor Last Name **] sign. No pericholecystic fluid.
STones in neck of gallbladder. Gallbladder wall distended at 5
mm and had been 3 mm. No dilated ducts.

There was concern given leukocytosis and CXR showing ? pneumonia
and his new onset renal failure.

Given elevated LFTS, a RUQ US was performed that showed 5 mm
gallbladder wall (up from 3 mm two weeks ago) with stones in the
neck of the gallbladder. There was no son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
Flagyl was subsequently added for broader coverage. A surgery
consult was called in the ER for aforementioned findings. The
impression was that although the patient has no abdominal
tenderness that given his diabetes his clinical exam may be
altered. His leukocytosis may be secondary to ? developing
pneumonia; however, his gallbladder wall is thickened and the
patient will likely require percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
His LFTs are difficult to interpret in context of acute illness,
and his CBD is not dilated.

He was transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for ? cholecystitis for
potential surgical procedure.

VS on transfer were T 98.2, BP 126/68, HR 74, RR 17, pOx 98 % RA
Urine output 475 mL
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED inital vitals were, 17:57 97.0 74 113/60 20 100%
2L Nasal Cannula.

Labs in [**Hospital1 18**] ER showed Na 137, K 5.4, Cl 104, HCO3 20, Lactate
2.6, Glc 271. Hgb was 10.

A general surgery consult was called in the ER. Impression was
admission to medicine with monitoring of LFTs and serial
abdominal exams. A percutaneous chole tube was not advised at
this time.

VS on transfer: AF, HR 74, BP 139/67, RR 22, pOx 100 % 3L

On arrival to the ICU, patient was initially sleepy, but then
awoke and wanted a piece of toast - which was given after
explaining that it would be optimal if he remained NPO given
concern for gallbladder process.
