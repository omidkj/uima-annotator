Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 38 yo M with pmhx significant only for asthma
who is admitted to the CCU for monitoring s/p
pericardiocentesis.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] first began having symptoms in
[**Month (only) 216**], which he describes as chest pain associated with SOB.
At that time he was evaluated at an outside ED, and was told
that he had pericarditis and a small pericardial effusion; this
was treated with ASA and his symptoms improved.  However, his
symptoms returned 1 week ago and he want to an OSH, where he was
admitted on Sunday for pericarditis. He was treated with motrin
PRN pain and discharged home. Over the last day, his chest pain
has returned very abruptly, and has become progressively worse.
He describes the pain as central, "sharp," [**2157-1-20**], worse with
movement and inspiration. It occasionally radiates to his throat
and shoulders, though last night it radiated to his back when he
got up to use the bathroom. The pain is constant and has now
lasted for 18+hrs. He has had fever and chills, up to 100.9
recorded at home. Also reports occasional myalgias, "like the
flu." States that the best position is sitting up ~ 45degrees,
worse with lying flat and worse with leaning forward. He has
also felt very fatigued and like he is "panting for breathe".
.
In the ED, initial vitals were : T 99.6 HR 80 BP 117/100 RR16
100% on RA, pain [**1-26**].  A pulsus was reportedly checked and was
16-18; he underwent a STAT echo which showed tamponade and was
sent to the cath lab for periocariocentesis.  In the lab, 570ccs
of bloody fluid was removed from the pericardium.  Pulsus was
measured at 40mmHg, down to 9mmHg after drainage. A pericardial
drain was left in place.
.
On arrival to the ccu, patient reports pain at site of the drain
insertion, [**2157-4-25**]. He otherwise feels relieved, and his SOB is
improved.

IMAGING
TTE [**8-18**] pre-procedure: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is a large pericardial effusion. There is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows and brief right ventricular
diastolic invagination, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
TTE [**8-18**] post-procedure: Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
TTE [**8-19**]: There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The parietal pericardium may be thickened. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. However, the findings are
suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction: late
diastolic recoil displacement ("shudder") is present, as is the
appearance of visceral-parietal pericardial tethering. The
spectral Doppler mitral inflow pattern is indeterminate for
constriction. Consider cardiac MRI scanning if you want to
evaluate for constrictive pericardial disease.
.
TTE [**8-21**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses, cavity size and
global systolic function are normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. Respiratory variation in transtricuspid There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-19**], the findings are
similar. The abnormal septal motion was present on the prior
study and may suggest mild constrictive physiology. A cardiac
MRI may help to non-invasively identify constriction.
.
Cath report [**8-18**]
Right heart catheterization confirmed tamponade physiology with
preserved
cardiac output.  Elevated and equalized filling pressures with
absent y descent.  Pulsus of 40 mm Hg.  Accessed the pericardial
space without difficulty and confirmed placement with agitated
saline injection.  Drained 570 cc of bloody fluid.  RA pressure
decreased and y descent returned.  BP increased and pulsus
decreased to 9 mm Hg.  Patient??????????????????s dyspnea resolved.
Pericardial
pressure decreased to 3 mm Hg.

Brief Hospital Course:
38yoM with no significant PMHx who presents with pericardial
effusions and signs of tamponade, likely related to
pericarditis, now s/p successful pericardiocentesis.
.
ACUTE
# Cardiac tamponade: presented with BP in 100's, SOB, with
evidence on TTE of pericardial effusion with tamponade
physiology. Brought to the cath lab where a pericardiocentesis
was performed, draining 570cc bloody fluid. In the cath lab he
had a pulsus paradoxus of 40mmHg. A pericardial drain was left
in place, and drained 120cc more fluid overnight. Repeat TTE
showed resolved effusion, drain pulled on HD2. Repeat TTE on HD3
showed that there was only trac
