Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Unwell with Right leg and Right lower quadrant abdominal pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
67 y.o with h.o CAD s/p inferolateral MI, CHF (EF ~20%), s/p ICD
for primary prevention, s/p recent admission for continued ICD
firing of ICD from VT thought be be from scar tissue from IMI.
.
During last admission [**Date range (1) 32298**], pt went into recurrent VT and
eventually required lidocaine, amiodarone, esmolol gtts to
prevent VT. During some of the VT episodes pt c/o CP. He also
was electively intubated due to recurrent VT/ICD firing.
.
Pt underwent attempted VT ablation on [**7-1**], but aortic valve
could not be passed. He experienced recurrent VT with
appropriate shocks, was evaluated by the EP service (pacer
decreased to VVI at 40bpm to limit V-pacing), bolused and
started on both amiodarone and lidocaine gtts, and transferred
to the CCU. Pt noted to have episodes of slow VT (below
detection threshold of ICD) so detection reduced to 118 and pt
stated on esmolol gtt to lower HR. Pt underwent cath with 3
sites of VT ablated. He then developed new morphology VT and was
restarted on amiodarone, lido, esmolol gtts. Pt transitioned off
IV meds to PO metoprolol, amiodarone, mexiletine and did not
experience any further episodes of VT prior to discharge.
Additionally, pt had been on coumadin and lovenox for a R.SCV
clot.
.
However, pt had been feeling well until yesterday afternoon
where he c/o LH, wife took BP, found to be 80's/30's. EMS
called, pt taken to [**Location (un) **] where he was given 2L IVF, HCT found
to be 30, INR 1.7, Cr 1.6. Non-con CT found 12x8cm RP hemamtoma
around R.kidney in proximity to R.CIA. Pt underwent a dx
procedure by IR, no intervention performed. HCT dropped from
26.3 to 20.7, transfused 2 units of PRBCs and has gotten 1 out
of 2 units of
FFP. L.IJ attempted/failed prior to CCU admit.
.
Currently pt reports, LH, R.leg discomfort, RLQ abdominal pain
and distention.
.
No known prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. Occassionally snores, but no witnessed
apneas. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,

dyspnea on exertion with 3 flight of stair, paroxysmal nocturnal

dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope,
currently reports LH.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 67 year old male with systolic CHF, recent VT,
HL, right subclavian clot who present with a large RP bleed
while on Coumadin.

#Anemia-  The patient presented with an RP bleed which appeared
to be a spontaneous bleed resulting from anticoagulation with
Coumadin/Lovenox for Right Subclavian DVT which had resolved on
RUE ultrasound.  Anticoagulation was discontinued and  the
patient received 10 units PBC (HCT 26.3 on admit dropped to
20.7) and 4 unit of FFP (INR 1.9). HCT baseline low 40's.
Interval CT scans during admission showed an increase in size of
the hematoma by 1cm.  However, on the day of discharge, HCT was
39.3 and had been stable for the 72 hours.  Pt has some
abdominal pain from bleed but has been moving his bowels.  The
patient continued to have pain in the right flank and hip, but
this was well controlled with oxycodone.  The patient was
discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for break-thru pain
and was scheduled for follow-up with cardiology and [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]
surgery.
.
#CARDIAC:  The patient had a history of VT thought to be
originating from IMI scar and maintained on PO antiarrhythmics
(metoprolol, mexiletine, amiodarone.
The patient also had a history of systolic heart failure (LVEF
30% per last cath) as well as 70%
