Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of CVA, baseline swallowing
difficulties. She was apparently in her USOH at her long term
care facility at 4pm when her son visited her. She had a recent
diagnosis of progressing pulmonary fibrosis. She was found to be
hypoxic to 79%on 3L NC and presented to [**Hospital1 **] where she
was found to be hypotensive to 80/48 and remained hypoxic at 82%
on NRB with respiratory distress. She was intubated and started
on dopamine peripherally for hypotension. She was given
zosyn/flagyl and 2L IVF and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Prior to
transfer she was made DNR for the ambulance ride, and
thereafter.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.6 130 119/51 99% on vent. CXR
with bilateral patchy infiltrates and question of PNA, pleural
effusions, concern for aspiration. Vancomycin added here. Now on
peripheral norepinephrine (0.04), son doesn't want CVC or other
invasive procedures, nor does he want escalation of care. No
increase in peripheral pressors. Plan is for family to come back
in am to address goals of care. Access is 18g and 20g x2 PIV.
Has gotten 2L IVF at [**Hospital1 18**]. Current VS: 78 152/52 18 100% on
vent. On midazolam for sedation.
.
On the floor, she is intubated, not responsive.

CXR [**2197-5-9**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-7**], there is
substantial increase in opacification bilaterally, especially at
the right base. This suggests developing pneumonia on a
substrate of significant interstitial lung disease.
There are probable bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
basilar
atelectasis.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
.
WRIST(3 + VIEWS) LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2197-5-10**] 5:45 AM
Three bedside radiographs of the left wrist. There is a
comminuted
prominently angulated Colles fracture of the distal radial
metaphysis which probably involves the distal articular surface.
The navicular bone is poorly assessed with probable old
postfracture deformity and marked narrowing of the radial
talonavicular joint. There is loss of length of the dorsal
portion of the radius with corresponding positive ulnar
variance. Prominent generalized emineralization.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted intra-articular Colles fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with pulmonary fibrosis, prior CVA
with resultant aphasia, HTN, and DM who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-N in
respiratory distress and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure thought to be secondary to aspiration. She had a history
of swallowing problems related to her prior CVA, as well as
progressing pulmonary fibrosis contributing to baseline poor
pulmonary function. She was admitted intubated after sudden
onset of hypoxic respiratory failure. Given recent
hospitalization, she was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for
aspiration/HCAP treatment. Mini-BAL was performed and cultures
revealed yeast. Her hypotension was from septic shock from a
pulmonary source. She was hypotensive on arrival to [**Hospital1 **]-N
requiring pressure support with Dopamine, then Levophed. She was
volume resuscitated with 4 L of NS and initially continued on
Levophed 0.04 delivered peripherally upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. Her
son (healthcare proxy) requested no central venous catheters,
pressors, or escalation of care. She was weaned off Levophed and
hypotension was managed with fluid boluses. In preparation for
extubation she was diuresed with Lasix drip. During her ICU stay
the patient began to experience large amounts of diarrhea. Stool
was sent for C difficile toxin assay, which was negative X 2.
Given her impressive leukocytosis, she was started on empiric
therapy with PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl. C difficile PCR was
sent. She had anion Gap metabolic acidosis secondary to lactic
acidosis with a lactate of 4.8. She was volume resuscitated as
above and acidosis resolved. On admission, sodium was 160 which
was likely an acute rather than chronic elevation. She appeared
grossly volume depleted suggesting hypovolemic hypernatremia.
She received 4L NS prior to arrival and was treated with DW5
with correction of serum sodium. The patient's left wrist was
noted to be swollen with overlying hematoma on presentation. An
x-ray was obtained that revealed a comminuted intra-articular
Colles fracture. Orthopedics was consulted and performed a
bedside reduction. Her clinic condition improved moderately and
she was able to be called out to the floor on [**2197-5-13**]. She was
extubated on [**2197-5-12**]. Goals of care were changed to CMO per
family wishes. All of her medications were discontinued except
morphine. Foley catheter and rectal tube remained for comfort.
She became DNR/Do not re intubate. She was transferred back to
her nursing home under hospice care.

Pending at the time of discharge: PCR of the stool for c
difficile.
