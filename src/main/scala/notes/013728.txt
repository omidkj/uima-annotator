THIS IS A STAT DISCHARGE ADDENDUM TO THE PREVIOUSLY DICTATED
DISCHARGE SUMMARY.

1.  Nutrition:  There was a follow-up Nutrition Consult on
[**2101-5-5**] recommending the following:  1.  Continue tube
feed prevalence at 45 cc/hr via G tube.  2.  Consider cycling
the tube feed prevalence full strength at 65 cc/16 hours
(1248 kcal, 56 grams) to allow time off pump.  3.  To
maintain baseline hydration, she will also require 160 cc of
water bolus q. 6 hours four times a day.  4.  If the patient
is unable to maintain weight, consider increasing tube feed
rate/time as tolerated.  With any questions, please contact
[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29328**], Registered dietician, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 29329**].

2.  Pain:  Due to the patient's persistent pain, an analgesic
regimen was changed as follows:  The oxycodone-acetaminophen
elixir was changed to standing 10 mL po q. 6 hours for better
pain control.  OxyContin was considered, however, it was felt
that this pill, which cannot be crushed, would not be able to
fit through the G tube and as such, standing more frequent
immediate release medications were recommended.  It is
thought at this time, that the patient would likely benefit
from a fentanyl patch beginning at 25 mcg/day, however, this
will left up to the discretion of the hospice evaluation.

3.  Goals of care:  Upon further discussion with the patient,
she clarified her goals further, stating that she wants to be
comfort measures only, no additional hospitalizations, no
procedures, no prolonged intravenous antibiotics, no
intubation, no CPR, no resuscitation and no medications that
would be used prophylactically, other than those that would
be directed towards the patient's primary and only goal of
comfort care.  The patient should have a palliative
care/hospice evaluation at the rehabilitation setting and
will likely be transitioned from acute rehabilitation to
long-term rehabilitation with hospice nursing care.  If there
are any questions regarding this plan, please feel free to
contact me at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**].
