HEAD CT [**2196-11-18**]
Several multicompartmental chornic subdural collections are seen
surrounding the right cerebral hemisphere. Adjacent to the right
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], a focus of hyperdensity may indicate an acute
component. Additionally, an old chronic subdural hematoma is
seen in the left parietal region. There is mass effect on the
right lateral ventricle, and shift of the central septum
pellucidum to the left, by 9 mm indicating subfalcine
herniation. The normal fourth ventricle is not clearly seen,
concerning for inferior herniation. The basilar cisterns are
preserved. The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures
are unremarkable.

HEAD CT [**2196-11-20**];POST-OP
Interval decrease in the subdural collection adjacent to the
right temporal region. Markedly decreased mass effect on the
right temproal lobe. The remaining extra- axial collections and
the brain parenchyma are unchanged. No new areas of hemorrhage
are identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old-female presented to ER with progresive mental status
decline after sustainign a fall at the nursing home a month ago.
Patient admitted to Neuro ICU for close monitoring. Pateint's
INR 2.5 reversed with Vitamin K, FFP. Pateint received 1000mg of
dilantin then continued with maintanence dose. Patient taken to
OR on [**2196-11-19**] electively for a right sided burr hole for
subdural hematoma, acute on chronic, right greater than left,
with right to left midline shift. She underwent general
endotracheal anesthesia by the anesthesia team. The patient was
hemodynamically stable on induction. Of note, the patient is
post hemodialysis the day of surgery. She taken ot the operating
room with corrected coagulations of INR of 1.3, but a PTT of 77
for which she received 2 units of FFP intraoperatively. There
were no intraoperative complications, and the blood loss was
minimal. Post operatively INR goal is less then 1.4. Serial Head
CT remained stable.

Patient has been followed by renal service, continues to have
her hemodialysis regularly. Breast service consulted for right
breast "peau d'orange" on physical exam to evaluate.Her last
mammograms were from [**2189**], [**2181**] has been normal.
