Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and delirium

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hip joint aspirate on [**2134-4-16**]
IR-guided lumbar puncture on [**2134-4-16**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79199**] is a 35 M who was brought to the ED from his sober
house tremulous, somnolent, and with slurred speech. Per report,
he took ten 1 mg pills of Xanax at 4pm on the day prior to
admission and 2 1mg Xanax tablets again on the day of admission,
3 hours prior to presentation.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.4 P 132 BP 165/118 R 26 O2 sat
92%. Initial chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy opacities
greater in the lower lung fields. Patient was given duonebs.
Labs were significant for a WBC of 13.0 with a bandemia of 7%.
Urine tox was positive for benzodiazepines, opiates, and
amphetamines. A right groin central venous catheter was placed.
Given fever and leukocytosis, patient was given Vancomycin and
levofloxacin. Urine and blood cultures were sent. In the ED, he
was also given 3L NS, with improvement of his heart rate. Prior
to transfer to the ICU, the patient spiked a temperature.

On arrival to the ICU, the patient's VS were T 100.8 HR 122 BP
138/61 RR 22 O2 Sat 96% on 2L. He was oriented x 3; however, he
was somnolent with slurred speech and unable to give a complete
history. He admitted to injecting cocaine and heroin prior to
admission. He also admitted to recently drinking beer. He gave
differing stories regarding his Xanax use. He admitted to some
slight shortness of breath and to cough. He also endorsed chest
tightness. He denied any nausea or recent vomiting. He also
endorsed a headache and some neck pain.

Of note, he does report a recent episode of falling on ice. He
endorses some left shoulder pain, knee pain, and right ankle
pain since this fall. It is unclear whether he hit his head in
this fall.

Past Medical History:
- Hepatitis C
- Chronic low back pain
- Polysubstance abuse
- Asthma
- Prior history of being stabbed in the chest requiring a
sternotomy and open repair with a synthetic patch. This surgery
was performed at [**Hospital1 2177**].

Smokes 1 pack per day. Denies heavy alcohol use. Admits to
marijuana and heroin use. Reports that he rarely uses cocaine.


Family History:
Not relevant to the current admission.

RADIOLOGY:
[**2134-4-15**] Portable Chest X-Ray:
1. Underpenetrated exam, presumably from patient body habitus.
2. Low lung volumes with suggestion of patchy bilateral
mid-to-lower lung opacities, which may in part relate to low
lung volumes and technique, however, multifocal infection or
edema are also a consideration depending on clinical situation.
Followup recommended and if clinically feasible, PA and lateral
views for further and better evaluation. 3. Status post median
sternotomy. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

[**2134-4-15**] CT Head:
No definite acute intracranial process is seen. If high clinical
concern for meningitis or acute ischemia, consider MRI if
patient is able to cooperate.

[**2134-4-16**] Left Hip Plain Film: No acute abnormality. If there is
concern for a joint effusion, recommend further evaluation with
MRI.

[**2134-4-16**] CT Left Lower Extremities without contrast: No acute
abnormalities. Specifically, no evidence of osteomyelitis, hip
joint
effusion, or necrotizing fasciitis.

[**2134-4-16**] CT of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis: Suboptimal timing
of the IV bolus (no peripheral line available, femoral line was
hand injected by radiologist). 1. Multifocal ground-glass lung
opacities, worse on the left, concerning for multifocal
pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting. 2. Bibasilar
opacities, more confluent, could be bibasilar atelectasis;
however, cannot exclude aspiration. 3. Moderate cardiomegaly. 4.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. 5. Left renal cyst
with probable dependent punctate stones in the interpolar region
of the left kidney. No hydronephrosis. 6. Possible fatty liver,
difficult to assess with certainty post-contrast.

[**2134-4-20**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a
transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to
exclude vegetation. IMPRESSION: no vegetations seen
