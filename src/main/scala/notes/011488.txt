CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST; -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN

Reason: Progression of bleed?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old woman with acute on chronic SDH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Progression of bleed?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Acute-on-chronic subdural hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: Routine non-contrast head CT.

COMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT 14 hours earlier.

FINDINGS: Again seen is a heterogeneous extra-axial fluid
collection layering along the left cerebral convexity. This
fluid collection measures mostly low-attenuation, consistent
with chronic subdural hematoma, however, there are multiple foci
of high-attenuation consistent with acute-on-chronic subdural
hematoma. The appearance of this hemorrhage has not
significantly changed since the prior exam. There is again noted
to be mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere with 12 mm of
rightward midline shift. The left temporal lobe uncus is
medially displaced, which is unchanged. In addition, a thin left
parafalcine subdural hematoma layering along the medial left
frontal lobe measuring 3 mm is stable. The surrounding osseous
and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The imaged
paranasal sinuses are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of acute-on-chronic left
subdural hematoma, with rightward midline shift and medial
displacement of the temporal lobe uncus. Unchanged parafalcine
subdural hematoma.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: DVT?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old woman with acute/chronic SDH, RLE swelling/pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
DVT?
INDICATION: 85-year-old woman with leg swelling.

[**Doctor Last Name **]-SCALE AND DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE BILATERAL LOWER
EXTREMITIES: Normal flow, compressibility, and augmentations are
seen in bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins. There is no evidence of DVT.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild biventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic
function. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild to
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT) RIGHT  [**2160-4-10**] 1:13 PM

VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT) R

Reason: SWOLLEN RT ARM

STUDY: Unilateral upper extremity venous duplex.

REASON: Right arm swelling.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of right upper
extremity veins. The jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,
cephalic, and basilic veins were identified. There is normal
compression, augmentation and phasicity of the jugular,
subclavian, axillary, brachial, and basilic veins. The cephalic
vein is noncompressible in the upper arm.

IMPRESSION: Right cephalic vein thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring from the ER.
She was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. A medicine
consult was obtained for pre-operatively clearance. They
recommended lasix for her heart failure. The patient was
transferred to the neuro step down unit. On HD#4 she was taken
to the OR for evacuation of her SDH.  Post-operatively she did
well and was transferred back to the step down unit.  Her issues
by system during this hospitalization were as follows:

Neuro: Her SDH was evacuated on HD#4.  Neurologically she waxed
and wained during the first several days post op.  On discharge
she was oriented to person only but was moving all extremeties
and had no other deficits.

Cardiac: She came in with known A-Fib.  Post-operatively she had
a number of episodes of RVR which was treated with beta
blockade. On [**4-8**] she was noted to be hypotensive and
tachycardic and was transferred to the ICU.  In the ICU she had
2 episodes of bradycardia to the 40's.  She was evaluated by
cardiology who felt she was stable on her betablockers and did
not recommend a pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome. On discharge
her rate was controlled on her current beta blocker regimine and
she had no further episodes of bradycardia or hypotension. She
also had an TTE for pre-operative clearance.

Resp: She was weaned off of oxygen postoperatively without
issues.

Renal: No issues

FEN/GI: She was evaluated by speech and swallow who recommended
thin liquids and ground solids with supervision.

Heme: Her right arm was noted to be swollen post-operatively.
An ultrasound of her RUE was obtained showing a R basilic clot.
She was started on ASA 325 for t
