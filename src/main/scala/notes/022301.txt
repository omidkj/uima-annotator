Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Clindamycin / Celery / Bee Sting Kit

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 year-old female with a history of morbid
obesity s/p gastric bypass, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma
who presents with few days of increasing dyspnea t home (home O2
3 L NC). Developed productive cough yesterday. Went to see PCP
and was found to have low SaO2 of 85. PCp sent pt to the ED for
evaluation.
.
On arrival to the ED, she was found to have an O2 sat of 68% on

2.5 Lbut her VS were otherwise stable (T 98.6, HR 85, RR 30
BP 138/66). She was mentating appropriately, A&O x 3, and stated
that her SOB was at its baseline. She was thought to have an
asthma
exacerbation, for which she was given nebs, steroids; NO abx. An
EKG was performed and by report demonstrated new TWi in III,avF
(new); this EKG is uanavilable. CEs were sent, though she denied
CP, and the first set was negative. She was later placed on a
50% ventimask and had an O2 sat of 96% at that time. A CXR was
also performed and was negative for any acute process and no
evidence of
hyperinflation.
.
Of note, during her prior hospitalization, she was found to have

a room air sat in the 70s% and 75% on 2L.
.
ROS: No CP, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, fevers. + cough with
white sputum. + usual sharp epigastric abd pain (resolved).

.
CXR [**2124-3-17**]: Unchanged cardiomegaly with evidence of pulmonary
arterial hypertension and vascular congestion. No overt evidence
of pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2124-3-18**] -
IMPRESSION:
Unchanged evidence of cardiomegaly and enlargement of the
pulmonary arteries, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. No
evidence of acute pulmonary edema .
.
[**2-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The

aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve

leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery

systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is

increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary
arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: advanced cor pulmonale

Brief Hospital Course:
58F with sever pulm hyptersion, asthma, and CHF, p/w hypoxia to
PCP's office.
.
# Hypoxia: Pt has known baseline poor pulmonary function, with
history of hypoxia and is on home O2, 2.5L at rest, 3L while
ambulating.  There is no correlation with pulse oximetry at
these settings.  She had a recent admission for asthma
exacerbation and finished her predinsone taper 2 days ago.  Her
volume overload was felt to be due to decreased dose of
torsemide during last admission and increased Na load with
tomato soups.  On initial exam she had minimal wheezing, but ~10
lb weight gain and fine crcakles bilaterally.  Based on crackles
and elevated BNP there was concern for volume overload.  By
admission to MICU, she was weaned to 2 L NC + 50% Venti.  Her
torsemide was increased to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and patient was -1L in ICU.
 She was continued on alternating NC and BiPAP on home settings.
 She was continued on home inhalers.
.
Patient was transferred to the floor and her exam was consistent
with volume overload. She was started on IV lasix and diuresed ~
5.4L during the next 3 days.  Her diuresis was limited by
relative, 90-100mmHg, asymptomatic hypotension.  Patient never
had shortness of breath or chest tightness during this
admission.  She was continued on her sidenafil for cor
pulmonale.  Her O2 saturations improved to 90-92% on 3L NC, with
abmulatory saturations of 90-92% requiring 4L on flat ground and
4-6L NC for ambulation up a flight of stairs to maintain O2 sat
> 92%.  Her discharge weight was 269 lbs.  Patient was
discharged home in this stable condition, with recommendation of
3L NC at rest and 3-4L NC with ambulation.  She was referred for
outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.  She was discharged on
Torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Hay fever.  Patient had persistent symptoms of nasal
congestion, post nasal drip and clear sputum with occaisional
cough.  She stated that she has had a long time standing
diagnosis of hayfever though did not appear to be documented in
OMR.  She was started Loratadine 10mg daily.
.
# EKG changes: By report new TWI in inferior leads. No
complaints of chest pain or pressure. Patient had clean
coronaries on catheterization in [**2120**]. An official
interpretation of ECG showed RAD, RV Hypertrophy and diffuse
ST/T changes without interim change from [**2124-2-21**].  Patient was
continued on ASA.
.
# Abdominal pain: The patient had no abd pain on admission and
was tolerating a diet without a problem. This issue has been
extensively evaluated on previous admission, she had recent
abd
