History of Present Illness:
75 y/o male with significant cardiac history since [**2122**]. Since
that time he has been followed for his mitral regurgitation and
coronary disease. He developed atrial fibrillation in [**8-28**] with

[**2127-3-16**] Chest X-ray: Heart is mildly enlarged, pulmonary
vasculature is mildly engorged, and there is no pulmonary edema
or pleural effusion. Four transvenous leads represent right
atrial pacer, right ventricular pacer, left ventricular pacer
and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads each terminating
in standard location, but continuity cannot be traced
equivocally to the left axillary pacemaker, except for the right
atrial lead because the lines are indistinguishable.
[**2127-3-17**] Carotid Ultrasound: Right ICA with 60% to 69% stenosis.
Left ICA with 40% to 59% stenosis.
[**2127-3-17**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of at
least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (ischemic MR is
suggested). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
[**2127-3-22**] Chest X-ray: 1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions left
greater than right. 2. New left infrahilar opacity may be
secondary to underlying fluid less likely reflects underlying
atelectasis and/or edema. Edema and associated atelectasis
cannot be entirely excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 76853**] was admitted for heparinization and routine
preoperative evaluation. Carotid ultrasound was notable for mild
to moderate disease of both internal carotid arteries(see result
section). Preoperative echocardiogram revealed 2+ mitral
regurgitation and an LVEF of 50-55%(see result section). Surgery
was initially delayed secondary to elevated prothrombin time.
Vitamin K was given with improvement in coagulation. On [**3-19**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting along
with mitral valve replacement and atrial septal defect closure.
See operative note for additional surgical details. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. On postoperative day one, he
transferred to the SDU for further care and recovery. He was
restarted on Warfarin and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 -
3.0. He was transfused with PRBC to maintain hematocrit near
30%. Pacemaker interrogation showed complete heart block and he
remained v-paced. Over several days, he continued to make
clinical improvements with diuresis. He was eventually cleared
for discharge to rehab on postoperative day 5.
