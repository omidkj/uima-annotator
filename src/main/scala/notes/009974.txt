History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 111659**] is a 78 year old female with PMHx of HTN,
COPD/Asthma, paroxysmal AF, PVD, s/p bilateral carotid
endarterectomies and aortic stenosis who was referred for right
and left heart cath in the setting of worsening SOB. She was
previously seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] after being hospitalized
with progressive PND, orthopnea, SOB and peripheral edema. Pt
presented to OSH repeatedly with RLQ pain and lower extremity
edema. Pt had some symptom relief with lasix and was discharged
on Lasix 40mg daily. Pt denies any chest discomfort, or
presyncope. She has some intermittent palpitations that she
associates with her Afib. Pt underwent an echo on [**2103-5-16**]-normal
LV size and function, mild mitral regurgitation and LVEF of 65%.
Aortic valve had three leaflets, was calcific with severe
stenosis. The peak gradient was 84 mmHg, the mean gradient was
60 mmHg and there was mild AI. There was left atrial
enlargement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-5-29**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS - No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS - There is preserved biventricular systolic function.
There is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the
aortic position. (Biocor #21 Epic supranullar). No AI is
visualized. The study is otherwise unchanged from the prebypass
period.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman s/p AVR/CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
CLINICAL HISTORY: Status post AVR and CABG.

CHEST

There is evidence of previous CABG. Heart remains enlarged. A
left effusion is present. Extensive atelectasis and a possible
infiltrate in the right lower and left lower lobe is present.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 111659**] was admitted to the cardiology service and
underwent cardiac catheterization which confirmed severe aortic
stenosis with a 60mmHg gradient and valve area of 0.6cm2.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system and a 60%
lesion in the proximal left anterior descending artery. Cardiac
surgery was therefore consulted and further evaluation was
performed. Given her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, she was
maintained on intravenous Heparin. Carotid ultrasound found only
mild to moderate disease of both internal carotid arteries.
Preoperative course was otherwise uneventful with mild
improvement in renal function. Prior to surgery, she was
transfused with PRBC for a hematocrit of 27%. On [**5-29**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic valve replacement, single vessel
coronary artery bypass grafting and Maze procedure. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. Amiodarone and Warfarin were
resumed. She was given additional PRBC to maintain hematocrit
near 30%. She otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day two. She converted
back to a rate controlled atrial fibrillation. She was started
on lovenox while her INR was subtherapeutic. She was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD #6.
