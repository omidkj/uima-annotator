Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain/Dissection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54yo male with who presented on [**6-21**] to an OSH
with low back pain and HTN (BP 220/120) and was found to have a
type B aortic dissection on CTA. He was started on Esmolol and
Nipride gtt and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
On [**6-22**] the patient was noted to be more confused and agitated.
including confusion and agitation. On [**6-23**] he was intubated for
airway protection. During this time he also had low-grade
fevers. On [**6-24**], the patient was started on Ampicillin,
Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone to empirically treat for bacterial
meningitis in the setting of fevers and mental status changes.
He also had a lumbar puncture with OP 44 mmHg, 1 WBC, Prot 52,
and Gluc 68. Based on these results, his antibiotics were
stopped and he remained on Vancomycin since he was found to have
GPCs in his blood cultures.

Past Medical History:
Aortic aneurysm, type B

Social History:
Patient has fiance, rides bike to work at a grocery store daily.


Physical Exam:
vitals T 99.4 BP AR 58 RR 11 O2 sat
vent MMV FI02 0.30 MV 4 [**3-26**]
Gen: Sedated, responsive to sternal rub
HEENT: ETT in place, PERRLA
Heart: RRR, no m,r,g

Extremties: No edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
Relevant Imaging:
1)TTE ([**6-22**]): The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.

2)TEE ([**6-23**]): Type B aortic intramural hematoma.

3)CT head ([**6-23**]): 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Chronic
lacunar infarct involving the right caudate and anterior limb
internal capsule and left subinsular region. 3. Extensive
opacification of bilateral ethmoid, maxillary, and frontal
sinuses.

4)MRI ([**6-24**]): Numerous bilateral supratentorial infarctions
probably combination of watershed and embolic ischemia.
Extensive sinonasal polyposis.

5)CT head ([**6-25**]): No evidence of hemorrhage. Possible acute left
middle cerebral artery infarction.

6)Renal ultrasound ([**6-27**]): 1. Asymmetry in the peak systolic
velocities of the main renal arteries, with the left measuring
considerably slower than the right. 2. No hydronephrosis. 3.
Trace free fluid in the abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection
who is being transferred to the MICU for further managment of
his acute medical issues.

1)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with low back pain
and hypertension. Imaging confirmed diagnosis of type B
dissection. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] vascular surgery
ICU for further management. He was started on a Labetolol gtt
for blood pressure control with goal SBP<130. He was continued
on this drip upon transfer to the MICU. In the MICU, he was
started on oral Labetolol which was titrated up to 800mg PO Q6H
as he was being weaned off the drip. In addition, he was started
on Captopril, Hydralazine, Norvasc, and Clonidine. The patient
had to go back on the drip several times given poor control of
his blood pressure. He was continued on ASA 325mg daily.
Vascular surgery did not feel that he needed any further imaging
of his aorta or kidneys. As Mr. [**Known lastname 79608**] requirements for BP
medication has decreased, he is now being discharged on
Labetalol 300mg TID, Clonidine 0.1mg patch, and Lisinopril 20mg.
 His pressures were maintained well below 130s for several days
prior to discharge on this regimen.

2)Stroke: Patient noted to have progressive global decline in
mental status after being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. MRI confirms
innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving
supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. Thought to be
embolic source but TTE/TEE were unrevealing. Also concerned
about an infected aortic aneurysm showering septic emboli. ID
was consulted but did not feel that he had an infected aortic
aneurysm. Neurology was consulted and recommended medical
management with Aspirin. [**Hospital1 **] listed amphetamine use on the
differential of potential causes, and it is important to note
that urine was initially positive for amphetamines.

3)Fevers: Patient noted to have low grade fevers associated with
mental status changes upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. He has GPCs in his
blood cultures which is thought to be [**12-23**] an a-line. He also had
a TTE and TEE which did not suggest endocarditis. He also had an
LP which is not consistent with bacterial meningitis. He was
started on Vancomycin for his a-line infection. His blood
cultures also grew out strep viridans which would be concerning
for endocarditis but his TTE and TEE were negative. An infected
aortic aneurysm would also be concerning but after talking with
ID and vascular surgery they did not feel that this was the
case.

4)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway
protection in the setting of acute mental status changes. He was
then extubated a few days into his hospital course and has been
maintaining excellent oxygen saturations on room air.

5)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission;
peaked to 2.4 and slowly coming down to 1.7. There was some
concern that the dissection was effecting his kidneys. He had a
renal ultrasound which showed no dissection of the renal
arteries. This was confirmed with vascular surgery.

6)EKG changes: Patient has impressive EKG changes with ST
depressions in lateral leads V3-V6 on admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
Cardiology was consulted and felt that these changes occurred in
the setting of demand ischemia. He also had elevated CK and
troponins. He was continued on ASA 325mg daily and enzymes were
no longer followed.

7)Anemia: Patient presented with Hct~36.5 on admission. Slowly
decreased to 24 during his MICU stay. Unclear etiology. There
was some concern that he was bleeding around or into his aorta.
This was low on the differential given his stable hemodynamics.
His Hct was trended daily and, after reaching a nadir of 22,
began trending up without intervention.  Likely Anemia of
Chronic Disease.
====================================================
Upon transfer to the medicine floor, the patient's overall
functional status consistently improved.  He progressed from
being A&OxO to A&Ox2. His speech became more fluent, his left
side neglect resolved, although he still has some difficulty
with coordination of his extremities.  His blood pressure
medications were slowly reduced and he ultimately settled within
the taget range of SBP<130 set by vascular.

An MRA of his renal arteries was done because doppler ultrasound
suggested assymmetric flow.  The MRA was suboptimal secondary to
movt and claustrophobia, but it did also show assymmetric flow.
It should be repeated at some later time when the patient is
better able to cooperate.  The dissection will have to be
serially imaged as per vascular surgery's reccommendations. The
pt has an appointment with them on [**8-7**].
