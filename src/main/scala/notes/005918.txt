Service:  [**Location (un) **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old female
with a past medical history significant for diabetes Type 2,
panhypopituitarism, status post resection, multiple prior
episodes of hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, end stage renal
disease, hemodialysis dependent, congestive heart failure
with ejection fraction less than 20% and coronary artery
disease who presented after being found unresponsive at home
with a fingerstick of 22.  The patient got 25 gm of D50 with
response in the Emergency Department associated with
vomiting.  Fingerstick was 103 on arrival in the Emergency
Department.  The patient reports that she was in her usual
state of health last night, ate a normal meal.  Family found
her about 3 AM on the floor.  On arrival to the Emergency
Room her temperature was 93.5, [**Location (un) **] pressure 199/86,
heartrate 79, sating 100% in room air.  [**Location (un) **] sugars in the
Emergency Department were 103 at 2:30 AM, 73 and 36 at 6:15
AM.  She got [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and it went up to 88 at 7:40 AM and
then ate breakfast and it went down to 42 at 10 AM.  She had
[**Location (un) 2452**] juice and vomited.  She received one amp of D50.
[**Location (un) **] sugars then went from 100 to 56 and then she had lunch.
The patient was noted to be incontinent of stool with guaiac
positive stool.  She also had episodes of emesis times two,
[**Location (un) **] pressure was erratic in the Emergency Department, 90s
to 120 systolic, briefly in the 80s.  She got 2 mg of
Decadron intravenously.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was essentially
negative with the exception of diarrhea, negative for
lightheadedness, negative for chest pain, shortness of
breath, melena, bright red [**Location (un) **] per rectum, abdominal pain,
positive for diarrhea for several days.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission was
notable for a temperature of 96.8, pulse 76, [**Location (un) **] pressure
112/88, respiratory rate 16, sating 100% on room air.  In
general this was an awake, alert, following commands elderly
female who was eating well.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat, pupils equal, round and reactive to light,
extraocular movements intact, sclera anicteric.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular was notable for regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal examination,
abdomen was soft but distended with mild periumbilical
tenderness and positive bowel sounds.  Extremities were 1+
edema, nonpitting, positive chronic venous stasis changes,
positive ichthyosis.  Rectal, brown, guaiac positive per
Emergency Department.  Neurological, the patient was oriented
following commands and moving all four extremities.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes mellitus #2, controlled
by diet for the last two to three years; 2.  Upper
gastrointestinal bleed in [**2101-5-31**] diagnosed with
esophagitis, esophageal ulcer and gastritis; 3.
Hypoglycemia, four admissions for hypoglycemia this year with
likely Glucagon response, unclear etiology; 4.  End stage
renal disease on hemodialysis times seven to eight years; 5.
Hypothyroidism controlled on Levothyroxine secondary to
pituitary adenoma resection; 6.  Hypertension; 7.  Congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%; 8.
Coronary artery disease; 9.  History of gastroesophageal
reflux disease; 10.  History of second degree
atrioventricular block; 11. Status post ovarian mass
resection in [**2087**]; 12.  Hemosiderosis diagnosed in [**2101-3-31**]
on abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scan likely affecting
her liver and ? other organs.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prednisone 10, Synthroid 75,
Protonix 40 q.d., Vitamin D 400 mg p.o. q.d., Multivitamins,
Senna prn.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her 58 year old diabetic
sister in an apartment from which they are in the process of
being evicted.  The patient is separated from her husband and
has no children secondary to inability to conceive.  Denies
smoking or alcohol history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for numerous first degree relatives
from her mother's side with diabetes mellitus.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission potassium 3.2.  Chest x-ray
showed no pneumonia or congestive heart failure on admission.
This patient was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit
given her hypoglycemia, inability to maintain normal glucose.
This occurred in the setting of not taking her Prednisone for
at least one week secondary to possible cause issues, likely
social issues related to her sister and her inability to
consistently supply Ms [**Known lastname 26868**] with her medications.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission the patient's insulin levels
were high.  Given the setting of hypoglycemia she was
maintained on a D10 drip originally at 35 cc/hr.  Etiology of
her hypoglycemia was not known.  The differential diagnosis
includes insulinoma and secondary phase of insulin response
per Endocrine.  The patient was also started on steroids,
initially Hydrocortisone and then changed to Dexamethasone so
that she could under [**Last Name (un) **] Stim testing.

1.  Hypoglycemia - After the patient was transferred to the
floor she was eating well and was quickly weaned off of her
D10 requiring no insulin coverage and no supplementary
glucose with normal meals according to the hospital schedule.
The patient was maintained on a renal diet for the remainder
of the admission, again no episodes of hypoglycemia.  In
addition she was offered peanut butter sandwiches
intermittently for nighttime snacks as high carbohydrate
snacks without protein or fat, more likely to cause delayed
insulin peak resulting in hypoglycemia during the night.  The
patient was also maintained on fingersticks q.i.d. plus an
additional fingerstick at 3 AM.  To further elucidate the
etiology of her hypoglycemia, the patient is to be scheduled
for a calcium stimulation venous sampling by our procedure to
be performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient was originally
loathe to participate as she did not want to endure any more
pain and was unwilling to undergo surgery, but given that she
knows she will be anesthetized for this procedure and there
is medical management available for insulinoma, she will
undergo this procedure.  The procedure is to localize a small
insulinoma that may or may not be present.

2.  Hypotension - The patient has been very labile the
beginning of admission, responsive to fluids, clinically dry.
After she began eating after transfer to the floor on [**9-30**], she required no more fluids to maintain her [**Month (only) **]
pressure.

3.  Diarrhea - The patient was spitting up [**Month (only) **] with a
positive nasogastric lavage on admission.  Her diarrhea
etiology was unclear, screening for ova and parasites culture
and Clostridium difficile was negative times two.  The
patient clearly had an upper gastrointestinal bleed on
admission with coffee ground emesis, but she had a stable
hematocrit with guaiac positive brown stool.  The patient was
maintained on a b.i.d., p.o. proton pump inhibitor, given
that her hematocrit climbed rather than fell,
Gastroenterology consult was not called given that this was
likely due to chronic gastritis/esophagitis.  The patient
never complained of epigastric pain or abdominal pain in
general.  Diarrhea was intermittent and per the patient's
chronic question as to whether this was due to diabetic
enteropathy the treatment for this would be Atropine, i.e.
Loperamide or Lomotil to help with decreasing stool volume
and increasing anal sphincter tone.  It was held off given
that we need another negative Clostridium difficile toxin to
be certain that this is not the etiology for her chronic
diarrhea.  Recommend follow up as an outpatient.

4.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis - The patient
underwent hemodialysis three ti
