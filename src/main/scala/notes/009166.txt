CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ischemic gangrenous right toes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old white male
with significant medical history status post cadaver renal
transplant in [**2167-5-6**] with known peripheral vascular
disease, bilateral common iliac stentings in [**2170-4-5**] with
re-angioplasty of the right common iliac in [**2172-3-7**]
who developed gangrene of the right toes due to a burn from a
heating pad two months prior to admission.  The patient had a
preoperative cardiology evaluation and had a positive P valve
study.  He underwent cardiac catheterization and lower
extremity arteriograms.  He had an angioplasty with stent to
the left circumflex on [**2172-4-2**].  This was followed
by 30 days of Plavix.  The patient now returns for right
lower extremity bypass.  He denies rest pain or claudication.

ALLERGIES:  Biaxin and Penicillin which causes nausea and
vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses include coronary artery
disease, status post angioplasty with stent placement to the
left circumflex in [**2172-3-7**].  He had a P valve on [**2172-4-26**] which was normal with an ejection fraction of 64%.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**0-0-0**].
The ejection fraction at that time was 63% with mild aortic
stenosis.  The patient has a history of congestive heart
failure.  The last admission for heart failure was [**2170-1-5**] which is compensated.  The patient is a Type 1 diabetic
with triopathy.  He has autonomic neuropathy.  He has a
history of hypertension, end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis since [**2161**] to [**2167**], when he underwent a cadaver
renal transplant, a history of pneumonia in [**2167-3-8**],
cervical stenosis, a history of pelvic fracture and left hand
fracture secondary to fall in [**2168**], history of right
navicular bone fracture in [**2169-7-6**], pyelonephritis in
[**2170-1-5**] treated, bilateral ankle fractures in
[**2170-12-6**], peripheral vascular disease status post
common iliac stent with balloon angioplasty to the right
common iliac artery.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Arteriovenous fistula in [**2161**],
cadaver renal transplant in [**2167-5-6**], lumbar diskectomy in
[**2168-5-5**], cervical laminectomy of C4 through 5 in
[**2170-1-5**], exploration for evacuation of hematoma post
laminectomy in [**2170-1-5**], cataract with intraocular lens
placement bilaterally, excision of skin cancer on the scalp.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prograft 2 mg b.i.d., Cellcept [**Pager number **]
mg b.i.d., Calcitriol 0.5 mcg q.d., Lopressor 75 mg t.i.d.,
Norvasc 10 mg q.d., Lasix 20 mg q.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d.,
NPH Insulin 29 units q. AM, regular insulin sliding scale,
Ambien 2.5 mg at h.s. and Silvadene 1% ointment to right
toes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired construction worker.  He is
married, lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] uses a cane to ambulate.
He denies smoking or alcohol use.  He has chronic
constipation and was just treated with Senna tablets.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, 97.8, 78, 18, blood
pressure 128/80, oxygen saturation 99% on room air.  General
appearance, alert, cooperative white male in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was
unremarkable.  Carotids are palpable.  There is a transmitted
cardiac murmur to the carotids.  The radial pulses are
nonpalpable.  He has a clotted arteriovenous fistula with no
thrill.  Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally.  Popliteal pulses
are 1+ bilaterally.  The right dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial are triphasic dopplerable signals.  The left dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial are dopplerable signals.  Chest
examination shows lungs clear to auscultation.  Heart regular
rate and rhythm with systolic ejection murmur at the base
radiating to the neck.  Abdominal examination, benign.
Bone/joint examination shows feet equally warm, there is no
edema of the ankles.  There is a deformity of the right
ankle.  There are dry gangrenous tips of toes 1 through 4,
there is no cellulitis, odor or drainage.  Neurological
examination is nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory studies include a
white count of 10.8, hematocrit 34.9, platelet counts
374,000.  BUN 44, creatinine 1.9, potassium 4.7, ALT 11, AST
14, creatinine kinase 59, calcium 10.7, phosphorus 2.7,
magnesium 1.6, PT/INR were normal.  Chest x-ray showed no
active cardiopulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram was normal
sinus rhythm, ventricular rate 75 with borderline first
degree atrioventricular block with poor R wave progression
with nonspecific ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
[**Hospital1 **] was consulted for diabetic management.  He was
preopped by Cardiology and was known to have asymptomatic
aortic stenosis with a mid cavity gradient of 36 mm.  He was
asymptomatic from his coronary artery disease.  They
recommended continuing beta blockers, resume Aspirin as soon
as possible, recommended give an aortic valve area of 1.32 cm
square, and mid cavitary gradient would keep him euvolemic.
Postoperatively cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms.  The
patient underwent a right common femoral to above-knee
popliteal with PTFE and a above-knee popliteal to AT with
nonreverse greater saphenous vein on the right on [**2172-5-13**].  He tolerated the procedure well and had a palpable
graft pulse at the end of the procedure.  The patient did
well immediately postoperatively and was transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continuing monitoring and
care.  The patient required 1 unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 28.7, post transfusion hematocrit was
32.8.  Creatinine kinases were 148, MBs were negative and
troponins less than 0.3.  Chest x-ray was clear, no
pneumothorax.  Electrocardiogram was without any changes.
The patient remained on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin
perioperatively.  His lung examination showed diminished
breathsounds at the bases.  Right extremity examination, the
leg was Ace wrapped with palpable dorsalis pedis and warm
foot.  He was heparin-blocked, his diet was advanced as
tolerated.  His Lasix was held on initial postoperative day
#1.  He was continued on perioperative antibiotics and he
remained in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit.  On
postoperative day #2, he continued to have intermittent
nausea and vomiting and initially improved after having a
bowel movement.  He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
His hematocrit remains stable at 30.3, BUN 27, creatinine
1.2.  His creatinine kinases peak at 519 and troponin became
elevated to 8. This was felt to be consistent with a small Non Q
wave MI. Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin were continued secondary to his elevated white
count which was followed serially.  The patient remained in
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit, discussion with renal
regarding immunosuppression and need for change secondary to
nausea.  He did not require any adjustment in his
immunosuppression.  He continued to be followed by [**Hospital1 **].
Podiatry was consulted regarding the management of the
patient's toe changes.  Recommendations were to continue
current therapy with the Silvadene cream.
