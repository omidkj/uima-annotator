Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
biliary drain size change

History of Present Illness:
76F with PMHx of afib, CAD, CHF, HTN, pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(Stage IIB at diagnosis in [**9-18**]) s/p Whipple and adjuvant
chemoradiation therapy now with metastatic disease, presenting
to MICU with respiratory failure s/p ERCP.

Patient with history of recurrent painless jaundice / biliary
obstruction attributed to pancreatic cancer progression, with
accompanying recent radiographic findings concerning for
malignant progression.  An ERCP was initially scheduled for [**7-4**]
but was aborted because of INR Of 5.9.  Patient was admitted for
normalization fo INR adn repeat ERCP. On [**7-7**], repeat ERCP was
conducted, but the choledocho-jejunostomy could not be accessed
and no stent was placed.  Therefore, an IR-guided percutaneous
drainage procedure was performed on [**7-10**]. Was initially noted to
have good drainage. However, subsequently was noted to have poor
drainage, perhaps due to proximal jejunal limb obstruction. Plan
was to go for repeat enteroscopy. Patient was discharged home in
the meantime, per famiy preference.

Today went for repeat single balloon ERCP for stenting of
hepatical-jejunal anastamosis. This was again unsuccessful. The
procedure was complicated by large amounts of muddy stomach
contents which was visualized by endoscopy and attempted
suction, but eventually requiring suction by OG tube x3. Patient
was extubated (difficult extubation), but did not tolerate,
desatting, tachypneic, tachycardic, increased WOB.  Was assessed
in ERCP suite by MICU resident.  In context of respiratory
failure, was re-intubated and admitted to MICU for further
management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 98.8   58   141/52
100%/100%FiO2, intubated on CMV 450x14, PEEP 5.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-7-17**]
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**10-8**], there has been
placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular
level, approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  Extensive
opacification is seen in the right mid-to-lower zone, worrisome
for pneumonia.  Prominence of the hilar regions could be a sign
of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Mild atelectatic changes
are seen at the bases.
There is a generalized lucency of the upper abdomen.  This
suggests the
possibility of free intraperitoneal gas.  Massively distended
bile could also be considered.
Right biliary drain is in place.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) PORT Study Date of [**2166-7-17**]
FINDINGS:  Portable supine and left lateral decubitus images of
the abdomen demonstrate a large amount of intra-abdominal free
air. Ther are multiple air-fluid levels, presumably secondary to
the patient's ascites as demonstrated on previous CT.  There is
a percutaneous biliary drain in place.
The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  Large amount of intra-abdominal free air and free
fluid.
