   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2158-1-12**] 12:39 PM

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

Reason: Please eval for line position

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman with altered MS, now s/p L basilic picc
placement.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for line position
INDICATION: PICC placement.

FINDINGS: A left PICC ends in the mid right atrium and should be
withdrawn approximately 2-3 cm. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged
compared to [**2158-1-11**]. Median sternotomy wires and a mitral
valve replacement are in place. New opacity present within the
right lower lobe. No failure, effusions, or pneumothorax are
seen. A calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: A left PICC ends in the mid right atrium. New
possible right lower lobe pneumonia.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not
available) of [**2150-10-22**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. Mass in the body of the LA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Severe global LV
hypokinesis. Severely
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Trivial MR. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm). Results were
personally

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. A echo dense large (approximately
3.7 x 3.0 cm)
irrgularly shaped mass is seen in the body of the left atrium
extending from
the posterior aspect of the atrium. The mass does not appear to
contact or
impinge upon the mitral valve prosthesis. The left ventricular
cavity size is
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. The right
ventricle is
probably dilated. Right ventricular free wall motion may be
preserved but
views are suboptimal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
