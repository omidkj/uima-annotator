History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 69 year-old woman with a history of asthma, CAD,
CHF (EF 10%), IDDM, CKD, discharged 1 week ago after an
admission for cellulitis and hypercarbic respiratory failure,
who now presents hypotension and acute on chronic kidney injury.

.
She was recently admitted [**12-1**] - [**12-11**]. She had acute on chronic
cellulitis and completed a 10 day course of vancomycin. She also
had hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She
was treated for a COPD exacerbation as well as volume overload
and was extubated after two days. She was called out of the ICU.
On the medical floor, she was agressively diuresed. Her heart
failure regimen was also optimized in consultation with
cardiology. In particular, metoprolol was increased from Toprol
XL 100 mg qday to metoprolol tartrate 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Lisinopril 2.5
mg was started. She remained mildly hypoxic and was discharged
to home on [**1-29**] L O2, having refused rehab. Her previous dose of
torsemide 100 mg daily was resumed on discharge. Creatinine was
1.5 on the day of discharge.
.
After arrival at home, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] was living with her husband who
noted her to be mostly immobile, unwilling to eat, and taking
her medications unreliably. A visiting nurse noted that she was
unable to care for herself and so was admitted to rehab from
home on [**12-14**]. At the time her initial BP was low 70s but
quicklky rose into the 80s and then 90s. Diuretics were held.
Despite holding torsemide for two days, the patient remained
hypotensive. Today, sge was noted to be more lethargic and BP
70s so she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Upon arrival to ED, initial VS: 96.6 58 103/42 18 99% 6L NC. FS
WNL. She was very confused. Blood pressure then fell into the
70s systolic. She was given vancomycin 1 g,
piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g, and 4 L NS. IJ was placed and
levophed started (initially at .03, titrated up to .12 prior to
transfer). She was not more hypoxic than baseline (99% on 2L).
EKG was similar to prior. Labs were notable for a troponin
elevated to .45 and creatinine 2.4. CXR did not demonstrate
volume overload or infiltrate. Her mental status improved after
the initiation of pressors. Cardiology was consulted with regard
to the elevated troponin. They thought an ischemic event was
unlikely and will follow. She was sent for CT head and torso
prior to transfer to the ICU. However, she refused the torso
portion of this exam. She was transferred to the ICU.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of low back pain
that is chronic for her. She also has leg pain when moved. She
denies chest pain, cough, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea,
diarrhea, dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 69 year-old woman with
ischemic cardiomyopathy and EF 10-15% who presents with
hypotension.
.
# Hypotension: Given [**Last Name (un) **], hyponatremia, hypotension, and good
response to 4 L IVF in the ED, this may have been simply related
to volume depletion and an aggressive heart failure regimen.
However, diuretics have recently been held and it is notable
that her bicarb and her Hct are actually both lower than
discharge on admission labs. CVP on admission was 18.  Sepsis
was also on the differential, but patient afebrile, WBC not
elevated, CXR clear, UA not impressive, so she was not initially
covered with antibiotics.  However, the following morning her
WBC was elevated so vancomycin and zosyn were started.
Norepinephrine was weaned to low doses and continued to maintain
MAP >60. Patient was transferred to the floor off pressors and
was normotensive for the remainder of her stay.  Her home
hypertension medications were held except for
hydrochlorothiazide which was restarted prior to discharge.
.
# Shortness of breath:  Patient with increased work of breathing
on the second hospital day.  This was attributed in part CHF
exacerbation.  She intermittently became drowsy.  ABGs showed
hypoxia and hypercarbia.  Bipap was used, but patient was poorly
tolerant of this and consistently took it off when she woke up.
She was also diuresed, with improvement in shortness of breath.
She was initially maintained on torsemide 20 mg daily with IV
lasix 40 mg prn volume overload.  After necessitating IV lasix
due to tachypnea, torsemide was increased to 30 mg daily.
Oxygen and IV morphine prn were continued as needed for comfort
although patient did not require IV morphine.  She remained
stable on 1-3L NC with no respiratory distress during her
hospital stay.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Baseline creatinine per
records obtained at last hospitalization ~1.5, which was what it
was on discharge a week ago.  2.5 on this admission. Given
concominant mild hyponatremia, hypotension, this may be simply
due to volume depletion.  Creatinine fell with IVF in the ED.
Urine electrolytes showed a prerenal etiology.  Labs were
discontinued on the floor per patient request.  She continued to
have good urine output throughout the rest of her hospital stay.
.
# Elevated troponin: Troponin .45. Recently, .08 in the setting
of not quite so bad renal function. It does seem likely that she
has had some cardiac ischemia, probably in the setting of poor
coronary perfusion secondary to systemic hypotension.  This was
trended and fell appropriately.
.
# Hyponatremia: likely secondary to volume depletion.  Improved
after IVF resuscitation. Labs discontinued on floor after
discussion with patient.
.
# CHF: EF 10%:  Metoprolol, ACEI, torsemide held in the setting
of hypotension but were restarted at lower-than-home-doses.  She
will be discharged on lower doses of these medications as she
has been stable during hospital stay.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled and anticoagulated on
admission. Was subtherapeutic INR after having warfarin held at
rehab for several days (for INR 5 on [**12-15**]).  Warfarin was
restarted at a lower dose and she was started on a heparin drip
while warfarin subtherapeutic.  INR was then found to be
supratherapeutic and warfarin was held.  Risks and benefits of
anticoagulation were discussed with patient and she decided that
she did not want to continue anticoagulatio
