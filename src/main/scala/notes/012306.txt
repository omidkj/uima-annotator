Admission Date:  [**2160-6-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-7-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2086-6-5**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 72 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure with ejection fraction of 15%, and recent
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] with sepsis
and suspected pneumonia complicated by congestive heart
failure, who is now admitted with congestive heart failure
due to medical noncompliance.

The patient was discharged home on [**2160-6-26**], with
instructions to continue taking Lasix and spironolactone.  He
states that he did not think that he should be taking any of
his medications until follow-up with his primary care
provider and presents two days later with severe shortness of
breath and chest pain.  In the Emergency Department, he
complained of four out ten chest pain with shortness of
breath, was treated with aspirin, heparin, Nitroglycerin, and
Lasix, then started on Bi-PAP.  The chest pain resolved with
increasing levels of Nitroglycerin but he failed to produce
urine in response to the Lasix.  The shortness of breath
improved with Bi-PAP, although the patient had difficulty
tolerating this treatment.

He denies any fevers, chills, cough, abdominal pain, nausea,
or vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft times three.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 15%.
3.  Status post ventricular fibrillation arrest.
4.  Elevated cholesterol.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Recent sepsis.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin causes a rash.
2.  Sulfa.
3.  Morphine.

MEDICATIONS
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. day (not taking).
4.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day (not taking).
5.  Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q. day (not taking).
6.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. three times a day.
7.  Lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q. day (held).
8.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
9.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day until [**2160-6-28**].
10. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. three times a day until [**2160-6-28**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives at home with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical examination, the patient
was afebrile with a temperature of 95.0 F.; heart rate 90;
blood pressure 100/60 and respiratory rate 21.  He was
saturating at 100% on Bi-PAP.  In general, the patient was
somnolent but arousable and dyspneic.  Head and Neck
examination revealed moist mucous membranes.  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Elevated jugular venous
distention.  Lungs had crackles and wheezes throughout
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur.  Abdomen was benign.
Extremities had no edema with two plus dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  Studies demonstrated a CBC with a white blood
cell count of 14.3 and hematocrit of 34.1.  Panel-7 was
significant for a BUN of 31 and creatinine of 1.4.  Initial
CK and troponin was 42 and less than 0.3 respectively.

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 110 beats per minute
with a left bundle branch block which is unchanged from prior
EKG on [**2160-6-23**].

Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema consistent with congestive
heart failure, small bilateral pleural effusions and
bilateral vascular atelectasis versus consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was started on
Niceritrol and successfully diuresed with 4 mg of intravenous
Bumex.  His beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were held and he
was continued on his digoxin and amiodarone.  It was
subsequently difficult to wean the patient off the Nicerotide
as he would re-enter pulmonary edema within an hour following
discontinuation.  The patient was started on low dose ACE
inhibitor in an attempt to decrease afterload prior to
discontinuing his Nicerotide.  He was ultimately diuresed
greater than four liters during his hospitalization, and his
Nicerotide was weaned to off.

On the fifth hospital day, the patient had a biventricular
pacer placed with defibrillator function.  This was
originally planned for the following week.  He was restarted
on his outpatient regimen of Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day and
spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q. day at the time of this
dictation.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in the Device
Clinic on [**2160-7-7**], at 02:00 p.m.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction with serial cardiac enzymes and
electrocardiograms.  His chest pain always occurs with flash
pulmonary edema, although ongoing ischemia as a cause of the
pulmonary edema cannot be ruled out.  At a later time, the
patient should be considered for stress testing versus
catheterization to evaluate for ongoing ischemia as a cause
of his recurrent pulmonary edema.

3.  RHYTHM:  The patient had a run of non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia during his previous admission for
which he was started on amiodarone.  Following placement of
his AICD, the patient was continued on his amiodarone and
long term treatment will be determined at a later time.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated with
Vancomycin for 48 hours post pacemaker placement.  He will be
changed to oral Keflex for three days to complete his
antibiotic course.


Further hospital course and Discharge Planning will be
dictated at a later time.
