Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Prosthetic Mitral Valve thrombosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:

66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**]) with prior
prosthetic Mitral valve and tricuspid ring transferred from OSH
with MV thrombosis and GI bleed with likely need for Cardiac
surgery.  Approx one month ago, patient was hospitalized for
CVA, receiving TPA which subsequently led to hemorrhagic
conversion of the infarct and worsening neurological status.
During that admission, the patient's coumadin was held and then
restarted prior to discharge to rehab. Pt was admitted on
[**2114-11-1**] at Good [**Hospital 57794**] hospital for a GI bleed after
restarting coumadin upon transfer to rehab.
Upon presentation to the OSH, patient was found to have blood in
her rectal vault. Her coumadin was held and she received IM
Vitamin K for her INR of 1.7 on admission. Her HCT on admission
was 39 and was 29 on transfer from OSH, she did not receive
blood products.
Cardiology was consulted and an echocardiogram was performed.
The echo showed mitral valve thrombosis and acute mtiral
stenosis. Fluroscopy was performed and showed that one of the
[**Last Name (un) 22837**] valve leaflets was immobile. Patient was transferred
initially for cardiac surgery, but was soon deemed to be a poor
candidate in the setting of a GI bleed and recent hemorrhagic
stroke.

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is
continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure consistent with
volume
overload. However, more coalescent areas at the left base and
both mid lung zones suggest superimposed multifocal pneumonia.

Tubes remain in place.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus is seen in the tip of
the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta up to 35cm from
the incisor. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6cm2 by
planimetry). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] A mechanical mitral valve
prosthesis is present. There is extensive thrombus around the
ring of the prosthesis that measures at least 3.4cm by 1.1cm by
dimension. There is a highly mobile component of the thrombus
that measure 1.9cm x 0.5cm that prolapses through the mitral
valve orifice. The anterior/septal mitral valve leaflet is
completely immobile. The posterior/lateral leaflet moves well.
The gradients across the mitral valve is suggestive of severe
valvular mitral stenosis. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is
present with trace tricuspid regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Impression: Extensive thrombus around the mechanical mitral
prosthesis causing severe mitral stenosis. Severe aortic
stenosis (although may be OVERestimated given poor LV function).
Thrombus in the left atrial appendage.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 66 year old female with a history of AVR, MVR, atrial
fibrillation and recent stroke w/hemorrhagic conversion who
presented to an OSH with a GI bleed and found to have a new MV
thrombus.  The patient was urgently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for the
 treatment of the mitral valve thrombus that was presumed to
have formed since her recent discharge from [**Hospital 7348**] (when her coumadin was held in the setting of a
hemorrhagic conversion of a TPA treated embolic stroke).
Surgery was immediately consulted for possible intervention on
the thrombus, but given her active GI bleed, it was felt she was
not a good surgical candidate.  In addition, thrombolysis was
not an option given her recent stroke and the current GI bleed.

Initially, the patient was started on a heparin gtt to stabilize
the thrombus.  The risks/benefits of this were discussed with
the family at length.  The first few days of her stay, she was
transfused 2 U and GI was consulted.  A TEE was done which
showed a large thrombus overlying the mitral valve.   The
patient had a markedly elevated WBC as well as possible
pneumonia on CXR and was given broad spectrum antibiotics with
Vancomycin and Meropenem ([**1-20**] many drug allergies).  She was
diuresed as well for pulmonary edema.  Over the next 48 hours,
pt continued to have melena and the family (and health care
proxy) decided that the patient would be better served with
comfort measures and hospice care.  Her daughter is the health
care proxy and activated this option.  She was discharged to
hospice with plans to keep oral medications that would assist in
comfort only.  Her antibiotics were discontinued.  She was given
Morphine prn for comfort.
