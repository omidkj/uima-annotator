L midline insertion


History of Present Illness:
89 year old male [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident with history of coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, OSA, multiple previous
pneumonias/bronchitis presents with 4 days shortness of breath
and non-productive cough, wheezing. At [**Hospital 100**] rehab providers
noted cough, wheezing and shortness of breath x 4 days. Started
on ceftriaxone 4 days prior to admission. Previous bronchitis on
[**5-9**] treated with azithromycin and nebulizers. Continued on nebs
since that time. Also given lasix, multiple doses over past few
days for possible chf exacerbation. "Labored breathing" as per
notes over this time with oxygen low to mid 90's on 3 liters
despite these interventions. Today, also became more lethargic,
responding only with small sentences, so decision made to send
patient to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.

.
pCXR: Limited study demonstrating patchy, multifocal airspace
process, superimposed on underlying chronic lung disease, which
may represent pneumonia.
.
CT chest:
1. Worsening of the basal bronchiectasis and bronchial wall
thickening, right more than left. Increased bibasal, right more
than left, areas of consolidation. These findings might be
either due to recurrent aspiration given the patient's hiatal
hernia but the existence of bronchomalacia in the right lower
lobe might also contribute to this finding being in part
atelectasis.

2. Air trapping secondary to bronchomalacia and atelectasis is
suspected.

3. Bronchial wall thickening worsened compared to the previous
study, involves bronchus intermedius.
.
TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is [**5-12**]
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic
function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-8-16**],
the left
ventricular walls are thicker. The suboptimal acoustic windows
of the current
study makes exclusion of a small regional wall motion
abnormality difficult
(overall left ventricular function appears normal).



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia: At baseline patient requires 2 L NC O2 prn and is
unable to do most physical activity, including walking.
Differential includes CHF exacerbation, PNA, PE. At this point
clinical suspicion of PE low despite pmh of DVT. Favor diagnosis
of bronchiectasis with impaired clearance of secretions and
possible repeated aspirations. CT chest without contrast
revealed some bibasilar airspace disease and bronchiectasis.
Patient is at risk for nosocomial PNA given he lives at [**Location **]. He
was treated with vanco/ceftriaxone and azithro initially. He
quickly improved in the ICU without further intervention and was
transferred to the floor where chest PT was started. His O2
continued to improve at his requirement is at baseline.
.
2. CV: He had a TTE which showed slight RV failure, given his
risk factors, and per his cardiologist, Dr.[**Name (NI) 9920**], note he was
felt to be at CVA risk so coumadin was started for afib. He was
started on lovenox until his INR is therapeutic.
.
3. Gout: cont allopurinol
.
4. Hypothyroid: cont. levothyroxine
.
5. FEN: Patient passed swallow evaluation.
.
6. Prophylaxis: hep sc, no indication now for bowel proph.
.
7. Code: DNR/DNI
