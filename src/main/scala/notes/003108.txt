Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-12-26**] - Coronary artery bypass x3 with the following grafts:
Left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending with
reverse saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal branch and
reverse saphenous vein graft to a right posterior descending

[**2129-12-20**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
74 yo male with history of CAD (3 BMS in [**2119**]) who presented to
PCP office today complaining of exertional/rest/post-prandial
epigastric chest pain/tightness for the past 3 weeks.  The pain
has been progressive and now occurs at rest and reminds him of
his chest pain 10 yrs ago. Pt was initialy on aspirin but
stopped it 1 mo when had hematuria. He restarted it 1.5 weeks
ago when recurrent chest pain, orinally intermittent and
associated with exertion describes as exertional.  At 5am today
chest pain awoke from sleep.
.
This morning, pt reports chest pain which awoke him from sleep.
It was [**10-1**] and lasted an hour relieved with 325 mg of ASA. He
then  reported to PCP office who referred him directly cardiac
cath.
.
In cath lab, pt was found to have mid 80% LAD, 60%OM1, distal
90%RCA, mid RCA stent with some in-stent restenosis, no
interventions occured. Cardiac surgery team will see pt for
likely CABG. Did not receive any plavix. Will place on heparin
gtt, continue aspirin 325, dilt and lipitor.

.
On arrival to the floor, patient had no complaints and reported
tolerating the procedure well.

Pertinent Results:
See below
EKG: [**12-20**] at 3pm: NSR HR 65, PR 150, QRS<120, NA, NI, No ST or
TW changes. No q waves.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
[**2129-12-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is probable
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible basal inferior
wall motion abnormality with preserved left ventricular ejection
fraction. Normal right ventricular systolic function. No
pathologic valvular disease.
.
ETT:
[**2123-12-13**] INTERPRETATION: This 68 year old man with a history of
CAD was referred to the lab for evaluation. The patient
exercised for 6.5
minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol and stopped for fatigue. This
represents a
fair physical working capacity for his age. No arm, neck, back
or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the
study. At peak exercise, there was 0.5-1 mm upsloping ST segment
depression in V4-6. These resolved within 1 minute of stopping
the test. The rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated apbs,
vpbs and 1 ventricular couplet. Appropriate hemodynamic response
to exercise. IMPRESSION: Borderline ischemic EKG changes in the
absence of anginal type symptoms. Nuclear report sent
separately.

MIBI IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left
ventricular cavity size and function. LVEF of 53%.

.
CARDIAC CATH:
[**2119**]: 1. Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system
revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was long
and had mild plaquing. The LAD was a long vessel that wrapped
around the apex with a proximal 30% stenosis after the first
septal perforator and before the first diagonal branch. The left
circumflex artery had a proximal calcified plaque with 70%
stenosis extending into the major OM2 which contained a 90%
stenosis at the origin of the small superior pole. The RCA had a
mid-vessel 80% stenosis just beyond the acute marginal and a 60%
stenosis just before the r-PDA. Overall, there was diffuse
disease along the entire length of the RCA.
  2. Resting hemodynamics showed normal filling pressures, with
PCW 8
and LVEDP 11 mm Hg.
  3. Left ventriculography showed normal wall motion and a
calculated
LVEF of 60%. No mitral regurgitation was seen.
  4. Successful PTCA and stenting of LCx/OM was performed with
<10%
residual stenosis, TIMI 3 flow and no angiographically-apparent
dissection (see PTCA comments).
  5. Successful PTCA and stenting of RCA was performed without
residual stenosis, TIMI 2 fast flow into 2 jailed acute marginal
branches, and no angiographically-apparent dissection (see PTCA
comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.
3. Normal right ventricular diastolic function.
4. Successful stenting of LCX/OM and RCA.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: CABG, evaluation for pleural effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2129-12-27**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the venous
introduction
sheath on the right has been removed. The lung volumes are
unchanged. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are present. Subsequent bilateral
areas of basal
atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary
edema.
