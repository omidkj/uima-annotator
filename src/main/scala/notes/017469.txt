                        ADDENDUM

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2169-8-13**], the patient was
awaiting discharge to [**Hospital3 **] Center; however,
on [**2169-8-16**], the patient had acute renal failure
with an increase in her creatinine from baseline of 1.0 to
2.0 which was most likely due to over diuresis.  In addition,
the patient's hematocrit decreased to 24.4 on [**2169-8-16**], which required 2 U of packed red blood cells.  The
patient's hematocrit since then has been stable at 34-35.

The patient's acute renal failure has since been resolved and
has been trending down.  Lasix was restarted at 60 mg p.o.
q.d.  Lisinopril has been held until the patient's hematocrit
is back to baseline.

The [**Hospital 228**] medical condition is now improved and stable
for discharge back to [**Hospital3 **] Center.
