History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62y.o M with a PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, AAA
(4.4cm [**10-12**]), RAS s/p L renal stent [**2195**], PVD, CKD (baseline Cr

felt that no acute surgical intervention was needed. Following
CTA IV bicarb was started for Cr of 5.2. He was given 1.5L NS

admitted to MICU for evaluation and management of hypotension

 Renal Ultrasound
1. Small atrophic right kidney, which is unchanged.
2. The left kidney is of good size, and while the resistive
indices are high,
the upstroke of the systolic waveform for the left renal artery
appears good,
indicating that the stent is patent.
3. The abdominal aorta cannot be assessed due to patient's
raised body mass index.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension-The patient had no evidence of aortic dissection
on CTA. Initial exam demonstrated a CVP of 20, warm extremities
with good capillary refill. CE and EKG without evidence of acute
ischemia.No evidence of fever or leukocytosis with SBPs to
110's. Patient had recent change in medications with increase in
home labetalol a few days before presentation thought to be
etiology hypotension. Required levophed given MAPS to high 40s.
Despite hypotension patient has maintained good urine output,
mental status and warm extremities. Hypotension resolved off
home antihypertensives.  After normalization of his blood
pressures in the MICU, he was transferred to a general medical
floor, shortly after transfer patient again became hypertensive,
his blood pressure medications were slowly restarted.  Initially
started on labetalol 100mg [**Hospital1 **], and after his renal function
returned to his baseline, his valsartan was also restarted,
initially at 40mg, with the goal of uptitration as an
outpatient.   With restarting his prior anti-hypertensives at
lower doses, patient's blood pressure was not at goal, as a
result he was also started on amlodipine 10mg daily.
.
# Acute Renal Failure - Cr up to 5.2 on admission, 2.9 on
transfer out of MICU.
Etiology: prerenal vs poor perfusion leading to ATN. Pt got CTA
with contrast (and bicarb), but too early post contrast load to
account for ARF. Renal consulted and raised question of
cholesterol emboli from severely atherosclerotic aorta to
kidneys, thus C3/C4 ordered. C3 wnl, C4 wnl. Nephrotoxic home
medications held.  After discharge from the MICU his renal
function continued to improve, with it down to 2.2 at the time
of discharge, with the etiology of his renal function
contributed to hypoperfusion due to hypotension leading to ATN.

.
# AAA/Aortic Ulceration - stable per CTA. [**Hospital1 **] surgery
following. CT surgery signed off. Plan to keep BP goals
normotensive but low. Will follow up as outpatient in 3 months
with MRI.
.
# Chronic Low Back Pain secondary to Compression Fractures.
Back pain was inciting event bringing patient to hospital,
concern on arrival for aortic dissection. No dissection by CT.
Close monitoring for changes in pain inhouse. Good pain control
currently with lidocaine patch, and outpatient oxycodone regimen
at the time of discharge.
.
# Anemia - Hct down slightly to 30 from 27.6 on admission,36.7
on dc from MICU.  No evidence of bleeding. Given hx AAA, HCT
checks have been q12 while in the MICU, all stools guiaced with
plan for transfusion for HCT<21, and recommendation to contact
[**Hospital1 1106**] stat for HCT drop.  Patient's HCT remained stable while
in the hospital, with no signs of bleeding.
.
# Anxiety/Depression-remained stable on his outpatient regimen
while in the hospital
