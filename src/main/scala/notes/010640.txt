Admission Date:  [**2166-5-28**]     Date of Death:  [**2166-7-1**]

Date of Birth:                  Sex: Male

Service: Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fatigue.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male who
was recently admitted from [**5-3**] to [**5-27**] to [**Hospital1 346**] for congestive heart failure, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and untreated pulmonary embolism.
He presents on [**5-28**], after increasing shortness of breath and
fatigue, just as in former hospitalization, one day after
discharge.  He was also complaining of a nonproductive cough. He
reported taking his medications and avoiding a salty diet and
denied chest pain. He also had questionable change in mental
status.

On arrival in the Emergency Department, blood pressure was 74/48
and his oxygen saturation was 67% on room air.  He received a 400
cc normal saline fluid bolus and his pressure increased.  An
arterial blood gases done on 100% non rebreather showed 7.26, 50,
69, with a lactate of 12.4.  He was initially started on Dopamine
for his blood pressure and responded to Bi-Pap. He was then
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

Per the patient's wife, his oxygen ran out at home, and he has
been without supplemental oxygen for at least several hours.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for the following:  1.) Coronary artery disease,
status post recent myocardial infarction, refusing all
interventions except for blood pressure medicines and aspirin.

2.) Congestive heart failure, with an echo showing an
ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and four chamber dilation as
well as severe hypokinesis of the left ventricle and right
ventricle.

3.) Hypertension.

4.) Peripheral vascular disease.

5.) Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, not being
treated secondary to the patient refusing Coumadin.

6.) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on baseline five
liters home oxygen.  In the past, the patient refused nebulizer
treatment.

7.) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, type II.

8.) Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

9.) History of right lower extremity cellulitis and Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.

10.) Anemia.

11.) History of NSVT.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications at the time of admission included
the following:
Combivent.
Fluticasone.
Salmeterol.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q. day.
Sublingual nitroglycerin.
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day.
Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which gives a rash. Heparin which
causes swelling per the wife.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history is significant for the following:
The patient and wife are homeless and rotate living between
various relatives' [**Name2 (NI) **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission to [**Hospital1 1444**], physical examination
revealed the following:  Vital signs revealed a temperature
of 96.3; blood pressure 108/64; pulse 86; respiratory rate
17; oxygen saturation 96% on Bi-Pap 10/5 at 100% oxygen.  In
general, he was an obese male, pleasant, alert and oriented
to name, hospital and year.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND
THROAT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
bilaterally.  Sclera anicteric.  Moist mucous membranes.
Neck:  Obese, unable to assess jugular venous distention.  No
masses.  Cardiovascular: Regular rate.  Normal S1 and S2,
distant heart sounds.  No mitral regurgitation appreciated.
Pulmonary:  Upper airway noises, crackles [**11-28**] the way up
bilaterally, diffuse rhonchi, no wheezes.  Abdomen:  Obese,
distended, normoactive bowel sounds, soft and nontender.
Extremities:  Left stage II heel ulcer with no drainage.
Multiple amputations of the toes on the right foot. Right
greater than left, non pitting 1 to 2+ edema bilaterally.
Erythema and chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally, right
greater than left.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and white count 11.8; hematocrit of
35.5; platelets 182; 81 neutrophils, 2 bands, 6 lymphs, 1
mono.  INR 2.5. Sodium of 141; potassium of 5.7; chloride 92;
bicarbonate 15; BUN 60; creatinine 2.6; glucose 150.  Anion
gap of 37. Calcium 9.1; phosphorus 7.0; magnesium 2.5;
lactate 12.4.  Arterial blood gases 7.26, 50, 69 on 100% non
rebreather. AA gradient was 581.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Hypotension.  The patient was initially put
on pressors and sent to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring.
However, his hypotension self-resolved and the pressors were able
to be weaned without any further intervention.  The following
morning, he had an additional hypotensive episode.  It was
thought at the time that his low blood pressures may have been
secondary to multiple pulmonary embolisms.  He had no further
episodes of hypotension throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization, after coming out of the unit.

2.) Acute renal failure. Though he initially had an elevated
creatinine and BUN on admission, he received fluids and they
trended down with no further intervention made.  His creatinine
after coming to the floor was 1.2.  It is likely that he had
hypotension causing his renal failure.

3.) Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
The patient initially had elevated CK's and troponin during his
early hospitalization.  However, his wife and the patient himself
refused cardiac catheterization as well as heparin.  He was
treated with aspirin, beta blocker and Imdur, which he often
would refuse.  Towards the end of his hospitalization, he did
agree to medical management and was placed on telemetry. This
showed occasional runs of NSVT which the patient had previously.
The patient and his wife wanted no intervention for these.

4.) Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus.  The patient has
a known deep vein thrombosis and multiple pulmonary emboli from
his prior admission, as found by lower extremity Dopplers and
CTA.  However, he and his wife refused anticoagulation
continually, even though they were told of the risks of the clot
burden, causing further pulmonary emboli and respiratory and
cardiovascular compromise, resulting in possible death.

5.) Congestive heart failure.  The patient has known systolic
dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and global
ventricular dilation as well as aspects of hypokinesis and
akinesis.  He did agree to take Lasix twice a day; however, his
wife required it to be p.o. rather than intravenous. They refused
a Foley to monitor his urine output even though he was
incontinent.  During the end of his hospitalization, with
worsening congestive heart failure, as shown both clinically and
on physical examination, as well as on chest x-ray, his wife
agreed to have occasional doses of intravenous Lasix, to which he
responded with increased urine output per the nurses but
clinically as still short of breath.

Over the course of his hospitalization, he required increasing
amounts of oxygen to keep his oxygen saturations near 88-90%.
During the last week of his hospitalization, he required 15
liters non rebreather with his oxygen saturation running anywhere
between the mid 70's to 90%.  He and his wife both refused
intubation.

6.) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient had been
prescribed both steroid inhalers as well as Albuterol and
Atrovent. However, he and his wife refused all his nebulizer or
inhaler treatments.

7.) Diabetes.  The patient took Glyburide but would refuse most
of his sliding scale insulin. According to his wife, he only
needed it when his sugars were greatly over 200.

8.) Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  We continued Pepcid.

9.) Heel ulcer.  We continued sterile dry dressings to his
left foot daily.

10.) Disposition:  The patient was difficult to treat, secondary
to his constant deferral of medical decisions to his wife, who
would refuse many of the treatments that were offered, including
blood draws, chest radiography, and medications.  Many family
meetings were conducted, during which the patient and his wife,
the medical team, psychiatry, case management were involved.
Psychiatry had deemed the patient competent to defer decisions to
the wife.  His son also became invo
