Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary artery bypass grafts x2 (LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM), Mitral
annulplasty
(25mm CE ring) [**2150-8-27**]


History of Present Illness:
75 year old female complaints of recent exertional shortness of
breath, increased over past month. Noted to have new murmur by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Sent to Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7756**] for echo which revealed wall motion
abnomality and mild LV dysfunction  related to an infarct. Echo
LFEF is 45%. ETT Nuclear showed reduced LVEF 22% with lateral
ischemia and inferoposterior hypokinesis. She was referred for a
cardiac catheterization and was found to have mitral valve
regurgitation and coronary artery disease. She is now referred
to cardiac surgery for mitral valve
replacement and revascularization.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]


FINDINGS:
BACKGROUND: There was technical difficulty with continuous FP1
electrode
artifact. The background alternated between 2 patterns. There
were
frequent fairly widespread, frontally predominant, often
synchronous but
on occasions more on the right, medium-voltage, brief runs of
1.5-2 Hz
sharp and slow wave discharges. This alternated with mixed
frequency
alpha (8 Hz) and theta ([**7-14**] Hz) waveforms. There were also
infrequent
bifrontal bursts of low amplitude 1 Hz delta which were
superimposed
with beta activity.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 3 entries in this file, all
due to
electrode artifact.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There was no entry in this file.
SLEEP: No sleep morphologies were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 80-85 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
due to
frequent fairly widespread, frontally predominant runs of sharp
and slow
wave discharges that are often synchronous but on occasions more
on the
right. This finding is indicative of an increased tendency for
seizures.
The background in between these epileptiform waves demonstrates
mixed
alpha and theta activity, indicative of a mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction with a nonspecific etiology. There were no
electrographic
seizures. This EEG showed no change compared to previous day.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focalities in the inferolateral wall, basal inferior wall.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets do not fully coapt. An eccentric, posteriorly directed
jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 55823**] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision.

POST-BYPASS:
Normal RV systolic function.
Overall LVEF 25%. There is a global moderate dysfunction with
focalities in the lateral and basal inferior walls.
Thoracic aorta is intact.
There is a ring seen in the
