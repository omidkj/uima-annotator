Chief Complaint:
S/P Fall with splenic laceration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with a splenic
laceration and multiple rib fractures.  He fell at home  on
[**2160-10-18**] and on [**2160-10-19**] was taken to the ER as his blood sugar
was 560 and he was hypotensive. Mr. [**Known lastname **] lives at home with
his son who takes care of him 24/7.  Upon further investigation
his hematocrit was 25 and he received 1 unit of packed red blood
cells.  His stool guiac was negative and he subsequently
underwent CT of abd and pelvis which showed a splenic laceration
and fractures of left ribs [**9-5**].  There was also some free fluid
in the pelvis prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2160-10-19**] Head CT : 1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Left phthisis bulbi.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease.

[**2160-10-20**] Abd CT : 1. Limited study due to patient motion and
extensive artifact. Within this limitation, there is a splenic
laceration with focal area of hyperdensity within the spleen,
which may represent a dilated varix and less likely a
pseudoaneurysm. Splenic Doppler ultrasound should be performed
to discern if this is arterial or venous. Extensive
hemoperitoneum surrounding the spleen, liver, right paracolic
gutter and within the pelvis is unchanged when compared to prior
exam. No active bleeding is seen.
2. Extensive amount of collaterals seen along the left flank.
This is
suggestive of a more central stenosis, perhaps subclavian or
brachiocephalic vein.
3. No definite liver or bowel injury, however evaluation limited
due to
aforementioned limitations.
4. Multiple left-sided rib fractures.
5. Seminal vesicles hypodensities which may represent cysts.

[**2160-10-20**] CXR : The heart size is normal. The patient is after
median sternotomy and CABG.  Mediastinal position, contour, and
width are unremarkable. The pacemaker leads terminate in right
atrium and right ventricle. An abandoned third pacemaker lead is
noted. The pacemaker is in the left hemithorax.
  There is left basal opacity most likely consistent with
atelectasis giving its new appearance compared to prior study
obtained on [**2160-10-19**]. The known rib fractures are
partially obscured by the projection of the pacemaker. There is
no evidence of pneumothorax, and there is no evidence of
pulmonary edema.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the ER and
subsequently admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management
and treatment.  He had some left upper quadrant abdominal pain
and his hematocrit on admission was 25.  He was transfused with
2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit rose to 30.
 His blood pressure was in the 130/80 range throughout.  The
abdomenal and pelvic CT from [**Hospital1 **] was reviewed by the
radiology department and was felt that there was no
extravasation of fluid in the pelvis.  The splenic laceration
was also very small.  They recommended following serial
hematocrits and should they fall he may need an angiogram with
subsequent embolization.  His hematocrit was followed closely
for 48 hours and remained in the 30 range. His blood pressure
was stable and his abdominal pain resolved.

He was transferred to the Trauma floor for further management.
Of note, he had a foley catheter placed 5 weeks ago as his son
was having a difficult time caring for him with his urinary
incontinence, especially with daily lasix.  Unfortunately a
urine culture was done at [**Hospital1 **] which grew out Proteus
Mirabilis sensitive to Cefazolin.  He was initially on IV Kefzol
and then switched to Keflex orally.  The catheter was removed on
[**2160-10-22**] but bladder scanned after eight hours for 600 cc's.
The catheter was then replaced and another voiding trial should
be done when he is more ambulatory.  Flomax was also started.

His blood sugars were out of control on admission and his Lantus
was resumed along with a tight sliding scale for coverage QID.
His son manages his care and adjusts his insulin as he sees fit
with the assistance of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1380**].  This will need to be followed
closely.

The Physical Therapy service was involved for a full evaluation
and felt that rehab would benefit him over time as his mobility
is compromised by his muscle weakness.  He will need teaching in
transferring to a wheel chair and as well as balance training.
The hope is that he will be able to return home with his son.
