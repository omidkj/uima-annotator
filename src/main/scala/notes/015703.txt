History of Present Illness:
59 year old male was recently seen by a new PCP for routine
physical and was noted to have some new changes on his EKG. He
was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation and had a stress echo.
The official report is not available, however according to
verbal report from Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], this was significant for
shortnes of breath during exercise and inferolateral hypokinesis
on the post exercise echo images. He reports having dyspnea with
exertion which is new over the last year. He reports dyspnea and
fatigue after walking about [**12-25**] of a mile. He has particularly
noticed this walking through the airport while carrying his
bags. He denies any chest pain.  He does report [**2-22**] pillow
orthopnea which he relates to his sinuses. He does report
chronic lower extremity edema over the last 2 years. He also
reports some leg pain when he walks for prolonged periods. He
was referred for a cariac catheterization and was found to have
coronary artery disease and is now being referred to cardiac
surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2154-4-18**] Echo PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
30-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic
aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen.
POST-CPB: The LV systolic function remains moderately depressed,
estimated EF=30-40%. (The patient is on nitroglycerin infusion.)
The MR appears to be mild. There is no evidence of aortic
dissection.

[**2154-4-24**] CXR: There are persistent low lung volumes. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable. Widened mediastinum has improved.
Pulmonary congestion has resolved. Bibasilar atelectases have
improved, right greater than left. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. Sternal
wires are aligned.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room.
However due to difficulty with intubation, he was intubated and
brought to the intensive care unit.  See anesthesia note for
further details.  He remained intubated and sedated overnight
and was brought to the operating [****] and underwent
coronary artery bypass graft surgery. See operative report for
further details.  He received vancomycin and cefazolin for
periop antibiotics.  Post operatively he was transferred to the
intensive care unit for management.  He remained intubated
overnight and in the morning of post operative day one, he was
weaned from propofol and placed on Precedex. Also was started on
steroids for potential laryngeal edema in plan for extubation.
He was weaned from ventilator and cook catheter was placed for
access with extubation with intensivist at bedside.  He remained
extubated without complications and steroids were stopped.  He
was started on Lasix for diuresis requiring Lasix drip due to
volume overload.  Over the next few days he was aggressively
diuresed and started on beta blockers and ace inhibitor for
blood pressure and heart rate management.  He continued to
progress and was transitioned to bolus dosing of Lasix.  On
postoperative day four he was ready for transfer to the floor.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol.  Physical therapy worked with him on strength and
mobility.  Antibiotics and warm packs were started for right
upper extremity phlebitis.  He continued to make steady progress
and on post-op day seven he was discharged to rehab facility
([**Location (un) 1036**] in [**Location (un) 620**]).  He received the appropriate
medications and follow-up appointments.
