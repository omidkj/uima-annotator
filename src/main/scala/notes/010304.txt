Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10370**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo vasculopathic male w/PMH of CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF (EF
45%), CKD, and DM2, with recent admission [**Date range (1) **] for CHF
exacerbation, who now presents from [**Hospital3 **] facility
with increased shortness of breath. By pt's and son's report, he
had increasing SOB in the days prior to admission, as well as
worsening ankle edema. Today, his [**Doctor Last Name **] aide reported that he was
having difficulty even lifting his food and was more short of
breath even walking to the bathroom. Of note, functional
capacity in general is poor, and he cannot walk very far without
getting dyspneic. The pt notes recent orthopnea but no PND.
Denies any fevers or chills, no worsening cough or CP. Does
endorse mild dysuria. He states that he has been taking his
medications every day, and only has a little bit of salt with
his cereal. Given his symptoms, his family called Dr.[**Name (NI) 21573**]
office who recommended going to the ED.
.
In ED, VS = 96.4 70 120/75 30-35 100%4L. Exam revealed diffuse
bilateral crackles, and LE with mild edema. Labs revealed
baseline HCT and CKD. CE's were also at baseline. BNP was 4200,
elevated from prior values. CXR showed interstitial infiltrates
most c/w volume overload. An EKG showed known ventricular
pacing, without change from prior. Blood and urine cultures were
sent, and he received levofloxacin x 1 for empiric PNA coverage.
He also received 125mg IV solumedrol (? concern for COPD),
combivent nebulizers x 2, and 60mg IV lasix, to which he put out
300cc of urine. He was placed on BiPAP 10/5/40%. ABG on those
settings was was 7.44/33/215/23. Lactate was 2.2. He was
admitted to the ICU for further care.
.
Currently he is off of BiPAP and appears in NAD.

CXR [**9-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. There is patchy opacity in the left mid lung, likely
pneumonia. Followup to clearance
2. Cardiomegaly with mild CHF and bilateral pleural effusions.

CXR [**9-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild congestive heart failure, improved since the previous
radiograph.
2. Resolution of left mid lung opacity.

[**9-24**] CT HEAD
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable acute infarction in the left temporal lobe. MRI is
recommended
for further evaluation. If the patient cannot tolerate MRI,
follow-up CT is suggested. This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M CHF, CAD s/p CABG, CKD, DM2, on home oxygen since last
admission who presents with shortness of breath most likely due
to acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF exacerbation who
improved with IV lasix diuresis.
.
# Probable Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF.  Pt had mild LE edema
on admission with  crackles and JVD on admission.  He was
originally admitted to the MICU and placed on BiPap and diuresed
with a lasix drip.  His CXR improved after diuresis which argued
against PNA. His urine legionella was neagtive.  He was then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] service where diuresis was continued
with Lasix 100mg IV.  He was then converted to torsemide 20mg PO
daily and discharged on this regimen with close PCP follow up.
He had no LE edema at the time of discharge but did have
crackles half way up lungs bilaterally. He was also discharged
on potassium 20mg PO daily as he needed potassium repletion
consistently during his admission.  He is to fluid restrict
himself to 1L daily and continue a low sodium diet.  He was
instructed to call his PCP if he has any weight gain or
increased SOB. His weight at discharge was 146lbs and he was
breathing comfortably on room air but discharged on his previous
home oxygen for comfort as well as nebs PRN.
.
# CAD s/p CABG: The patient's b-blocker was held due to his CHF
exacerbation.  His carvedilol was restarted part way through his
admission.  He is not currently on an ACE due to an allergy. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**]
[**Last Name (un) **] was not started given his increased creatinine. He was
continued on ASA.  In terms of CE his troponins were 0.02 since
[**Month (only) **]. The patient was recently evaluated by cardiology who
determined there was no need for a statin.
.
Rhythm: CHB s/p PPM.  The patient was V-paced and monitored on
telemetry.
.
# R-sided weakness ? CVA: He was observed to have right hand
weakness. The hand weakness had been present for several days on
admission long outside the window for TPA. Given acute on
chronic renal failure he would not tolerate IV contrast. A CT of
the head showed acute temporal lobe infarct.  The decision was
made for an outpatient neurology work up given that there is no
indication for intervention.  He was continued on ASA. He was
seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy prior to
discharge.
.
# Stage 4 CKD - His stage 4 CKD is ikely from HTN or DM
nephropathy. His creatinine was mildly elevated to 3.3 from his
baseline of 2.6 and decreased to 2.8 at the time of discharge.
His urine lytes were consistent with a pre-renal state likely
from poor forward flow. His meds were renally dosed.
.
# Hyperkalemia ?????? His original hyperkalemia resolved with
diuresis. He later required
