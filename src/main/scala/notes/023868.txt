Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
54 yr old female with no significant PMH (has not seen doctor
for 10 yrs [**3-8**] lack of insurance) who was in usual state of
health until 2 weeks ago. At that time she had onset of
rhinorrhea and non-productive cough. She was doing well without
fevers, chills, SOB or pain until 4 days prior to admission when
she had acute onset of "stabbing epigastric pain" radiating to
her back. The pain was severe and more or less constant. It was
not related to position. However, she complains of even more
severe pain that has occurred regularly, 10-15 minutes after
eating and then resolves within 15-20 minutes. She has not had
any nausea or vomiting but has had diarrhea with black, but no
bloody stool for the past five days. The morning of admission
she had even more severe pain, " it was either go to the
hospital or shoot myself". There she was found to have a normal
abdominal US but ? AAA by CT. She was started on Nipride and
Esmolol and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here patient was
hemodynamically stable and pain free. She underwent repeat CT
angio which demonstrated ulcerated plaque at descending aorta
near diaphragm with hematoma propogated to L subclavian
proximally and to L common iliac distally vs. Type B dissection.
Per radiology all branch vessels were completely patent. There
was a small area of intestine with possible thickened wall but
no clear indication of mesenteric ischemia. She also has LLL
consolidation with small effusion. She was seen by Vascular
Surgery who stated she did not require urgent surgical repair
and then admitted to CCU for monitoring and tight blood pressure
control.
Risk factors for dissection include only 30+ pack years of
tobacco. No family history of dissection or aneurysm. +Early CAD
in extended family. No h/o CTD.

Physical Exam:
BP 130s, P 60s

CT scan [**2197-3-9**]:
REPORT: Distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery
there is a circumferential hematoma surrounding the descending
thoracic aorta. This extends inferiorly to the level of the
takeoff of the common iliac arteries and into the proximal left
common iliac atery. While the aorta is relatively round more
proximally in the chest, more distally it becomes eccentric and
crescent-shaped. One focal area of high attenuation is
identified extending into the mural hematoma at the level of the
diaphragmatic crura. The origins of both renal arteries, SMA,
celiac axis, and both common iliac arteries are all identified
and appear parent and uninvolved, except for the origin of the
left iliac artery, as described.

No evidence of renal infarct or splenic infarct is seen.

Though no discrete flap is seen, the appearances are felt to be
more consistent with a Type B dissection with a focal
penetrating ulcer at the level of the diphragmatic crura.

There is a small left pleural effusion or hemothorax associated
with compressive atelectasis. Minimal nonspecific change is
identified in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and
in the lingula, which may represent a small amount of pneumonia.
The visualized portions of the bones appear normal.

CONCLUSION:
Long segment of circumferential and eccentric mural thickening,
more consistent with a dissection with thrombosis of the extent
of the false lumen vs. an intramural hematoma. A short area of
patency or focal penetrating ulcer is seen.

CTA, [**2197-3-10**]:
CTA OF THE ABDOMEN: There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is a
small left pleural effusion not significantly changed from 1 day
prior, measuring between 5 and 30 Houndsfield units, and may
contain some hemorrhage. There is circumferential hematoma
surrounding the descending thoracic aorta extending to the level
of the common iliac arteries into the proximal left common iliac
artery. There is an unchanged area of focal high attenuation
extending into the mural hematoma at the level of the
diaphragmatic pleura. Again, this is stable in appearance. On
the non-contrast images, there is an area of higher attenuation
within the aortic lumen, suggesting an intramural hematoma. On
the contrast images, the area of contrast extravasation appears
to be within this intramural hematoma. Alternatively this could
represent an ulcerated plaque with extravasation. The liver,
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, unopacified large and small bowel
are unremarkable. There is an exophytic high attenuation
structure off the lower pole of the right kidney, which does not
appear to enhance, and is consistent with a hyperdense cyst.
There is a stable small amount of stranding around the right
kidney. There is also minimal stranding around the left kidney.
No other free fluid in the abdomen or pathologically enlarged
lymph nodes.

CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The origins of both renal arteries, SMA,
celiac access, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and right iliac artery are all uninvoled in
this intramural hematoma. The origin of the left iliac artery is
involved with adjacent mural hematoma. The distal left common
iliac artery appears normal.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The Foley catheter is within the
bladder which is otherwise normal. The uterus and adnexa are
normal. The rectum and sigmoid colon are normal. There is a
small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, likely physiologic. No
pathologically enlarged inguinal lymph nodes.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

REFORMATTED IMAGES: These show the contrast extravasation from
the descending thoracic aorta.

IMPRESSION: Findings are more consistent with a long segment of
intramural hematoma within the aorta, from an ulcerated plaque.
The appearance is stable from yesterday.
