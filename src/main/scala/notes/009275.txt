Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
evaluation by IP for cause of frequent intubations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**1-25**]: bronchoscopy
[**1-26**]: rigid bronchoscopy
[**1-30**]: transesophageal echocardiogram with cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 24630**] is a 64F with ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, afib,
tracheobronchiomalacia, multinodular goiter, and OSA referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for possible IP intervention for ?tracheomalacia.
.
She had been having increased dyspnea and sputum production x 2
weeks prior to presentation to OSH along with nasal congestion,
but no fevers, chills, sweats. On [**1-16**] on way to HD session she
developed increased SOB and was taken to an OSH. There, she
developed increasing respiratory distress and was intubated. ABG
showed 7.27/56/334 on 100% O2. She became hypotensive to 60's
SBP following intubation requiring IVF resuscitation. She was
admitted to the OSH ICU for further care. Vancomycin and Zosyn
were started empirically on [**1-16**] for a possible pna. She was
extubated on [**1-17**], but had to be reintubated that day following
increased SOB that developed while she was getting a CT of her
chest to rule out PE or pneumonia. CTA apparently showed a small
right sided PE and she was started on heparin IV. On
reintubation, it was apparently difficult to pass an ET tube
through the vocal cords. A flexible bronchoscopy performed [**1-18**]
showed a normal trachea that was "somewhat collapsible" on
expiration, also observed in the "right and left
tracheobronchial tree". The RLL had a few retained secretions
and debris. No endobronchial lesions were observed. Her hospital
course was also notable for afib with RVR managed with IV
metoprolol. Patient underwent HD today prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
On evaluation in the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, she denies any pain. Her
breathing is "so-so" on the ventilator. She has recently had
some loose stools but denies any abdominal pain. Had fever to
101F today. Makes minimal amounts of urine, no dysuria. No
pleuritic chest discomfort, leg discomfort, history of DVT.
.
TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 **]-CARDIOLOGY SERVICE:
This is a 64F with an extremely complicated hospitalization
lasting approximately 6 months who is being transered to the
[**Hospital1 1516**] Service for control of asypmtomatic atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response to > 120/min that has been
difficult to control on the general medical floor.
.
In brief, she presented to an OSH with cellulitis that
progressed rapidly to sepsis in [**7-5**]. Her hospitalization was
complicated by acute renal failure for which she has been on HD
for several months and respiratory distress, possibly ARDS,
requiring intubation. She was difficult to wean from the
ventilator and remained intubated via tracheostomy until [**11-5**].
Throughout her hospitalization she was noted to be in Afib with
RVR. She was initially treated with Bblockers and started on
heparin drip and transitioned to warfarin. After extubation she
continued to have stridor and respiratory compromise. She was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of presumed tracheamalacia.
Throughout her hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] (since [**2119-1-20**] to
transfer on [**2119-1-28**]) she has been in afib with RVR. Over the
past day her rate has been increasingly difficult to control.
During her initial MICU stay for tracheal debridement she had a
bronchospastic reaction to Bblockers and was transitioned to
diltiazem. She required increasing doses of PO diltiazem to the
max dose of 360mg PO daily in divided doses. On top of that she
received a total of 65mg IV in 12 hours and continued to be
tachycardic but asymptomatic assuming her baseline SOB is not
related to her afib with RVR (which may not be the case). She
was ultimately transfered to the [**Hospital1 1516**] Service for management of
Afib with RVR and possible cardioversion.
.
On the floor she is able to speak in short sentances [**1-30**] dyspnea
but reports that the is good for her from a respiratory
standpoint. She related her complicated history with the help of
her daughter as she was sedated and on a ventilator for much of
her hospitalization.
