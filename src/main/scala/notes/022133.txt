History of Present Illness:
69 y.o. female with COPD, CHF, DM2, GERD/esophagitis, who was
admitted initially on [**4-13**] for cough, SOB, and fever. She was
diagnosed with flu/MRSA pneumonia and underlying COPD flare and
treated appropriately with tamiflu, antibiotics, and steroids.
However, on [**4-16**] she was transferred to the MICU for increasing
respiratory distress. Her symptoms gradually improved with
supportive care and was transferred back to the medical floor on
[**4-20**]. However, the patient next had persistent hypoglemia to the
70s with associated mental status changes requiring D50 and
D5NS. Because of difficult to control blood sugars, he was
transferred back to the MICU.
.
Then, on [**4-22**], she was noted to have lower quadrant pain. She
underwent CT scan demonstrating a significant abdominal wall
rectus sheath hematoma on the left side, 12x5cm. Her Hct dropped
from 35.1 to 19.1, requiring 14 units PRBCs, 12 units plasma,
and 1 cryo, possibly due to punctured epigastric vein. IR/Vasc
surgery was consulted and she underwent angio embolization of
the L inferior epigastric vein with insicion and hematoma
evacuation x2 followed by VAC. She was taken by the SICU service
and was intubated. During her course on the surgical services
she had received 24u PRBC, 13FFP, 5 plts, 1 cryo. She then had
low grade fevers with spikes to 101, growing pseudomonas from
her sputum and urine. Her CVL was changed on [**5-11**] and she
underwent trach placement for persistent need for ventilator
support. She was started on meropenem on [**5-12**] for the pseudomonal
infection. Lastly, she developed acute renal failure with
baseline Cr 1.5-1.7 increasing to 2.3->2.7 with FENa of  1.3%.
Patient has since been monitored for the aforementioned medical
problems during her course in the ICU until discharge.

STUDIES:
=========
CT Abdomen ([**4-22**]):
IMPRESSION: Large hemorrhage into the subcutaneous fat of the
left lower abdomen/back. The largest collection in the left
lower abdominal wall measures 12.5 x 5.3 cm and is virtually
unchanged in dimensions when compared to the ultrasound
examination performed eight hours earlier at the same day. Of
note, there is an extension of the hematoma around the left
flank into the left lower back. The superior margin of this
posterior collection is not completely included in the study.
The hemorrhage may have been caused by puncture of a superficial
vessel, such as the superficial epigastric vein, during s.q.
heparin injection.
