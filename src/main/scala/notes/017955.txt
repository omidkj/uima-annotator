----Imaging:-----

***CT-Head***

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
acute large vacular territory infarction. Prominence of the
ventricles and
sulci reflects generalized atrophy and appears similar to the
prior
examination. Confluent areas of periventricular and subcortical
white matter
hypodensities most likely reflects sequela of chronic small
vessel ischemic
disease. There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid
siphons. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

***CT-Abdomen***

IMPRESSION:

1. Dilatation of a segment of small bowel up to 3.5 cm without
evidence of
abrupt transition point and oral contrast is seen beyond this
loop of bowel in
decompressed loops. Findings are consistewnt with partial
obstruction.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
with simple
fluid attenuation.

3. Evidence of prior granulomatous disease in the liver and
spleen.

4. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.

5. Left renal cysts.

6. Multiple compression deformities, age indeterminate.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with hypertensive crisis likely secondary to
missing anti-hypertensive doses because of N/V.  Pt was found to
have SBP>200 and had concurrent complaints of mental fuzziness
(however, baseline AD).  Was started on labetalol drip because
of inability to tolerate PO.  In the ICU, pt was maintained on
labetalol drip until could tolerate PO medications, and was then
restarted on home carvedilol and losartan, and because it was
thought that her nausea might be in part due to very high dose
of fentanyl, fentanyl patch dose was decreased to 50mcg.  SBPs
on HD1 occasionally spiked despite home antihypertensives, so
patient was additionally started on 2.5mg amlodipine daily.
Transferred to floor with stable VS. Overnight, pt vitals
remained stable with a BP of 146-150/66-67. Her SOB improved and
cognitive functioning returned closer to baseline. She was
deemed stable for discharge to  rehabilitation.  She did have
diarrhea after having an aggressive bowel regimen in the ICU.
She was repleted with gentle fluids and her creatinine and dry
mouth improved.  We were gentle because of her known heart
failure with an EF of about 35%.  She was doing well and at her
baseline and happy to be with her husband.
