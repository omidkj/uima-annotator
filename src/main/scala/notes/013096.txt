Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Obtundation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 66 female with PMHx significant for DM2, HTN, gastric
adenocarcinoma who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2181-3-7**] s/p subtotal gastrectomy on [**2181-2-21**] who now presents
after being found obtunded [**2181-3-14**] at home.
.
According to the patient's husband, she has been complaining of
abdominal pain since leaving the hospital. She has also had
intermittent nausea & vomiting, which she had also experienced
during her last admission.
.The patient states that she has been taking her insulin as
prescribed since leaving the hospital. She was evaluated by
[**Last Name (un) **] during her previous admission for elevated blood glucose
in the post-operative setting. She was started on long-acting
insulin prior to discharge with a plan to follow up with [**Last Name (un) **]
as an outpatient.
.
In the ED:
Initial VS: 97.4  127  34  92/47  100 % on NRB
On arrival, FSBG read critically high. Initially chem 7 revealed
glucose 843, K 5.3, creat 1.7 (from 1.0 on discharge), bicarb 6,
WBC 18.2 with 90% polys, no bands. Venous lactate 9.1, AG 44.
ABG: 7.07/20/115/6. The patient was given 10 units IV insulin
bolus & started on insulin gtt at 10 units per hour. One hour
later, ABG: 6.98/21/89/5. Repeat chemistries showed gap 35,
glucose 768. In total, she received 5.5 L NS in the ED. CXR
showed patchy opacification R > L although low lung volumes. EKG
unremarkable for ischemic changes but revealed peaked T waves.
As such, the patient was given calcium gluconate. The patient
was started on IV levofloxacin and IV vancomycin for presumed
CAP. IV Flagyl was subsequently started to cover intra-abdominal
pathogens. She was given 5 mg IV morphine for pain.
.
In the ICU, her anion gap closed. CT Abn/Pelvis showed a small
fluid collection in the subcutaneous tissues along the incision
site c/w postoperative seroma, new compression deformities at
the superior endplate of T11 and L1 compared to study on
[**2181-1-9**]. She was seen by surgery who agreed there was
no intra-abdominal abscess and thus no need for intervention. On
[**2181-3-16**], C. diff was negative, so IV flagyl was discontinued.
CXR was negative so vancomycin was stopped and a decision to
continue cefepime for 7 day course ([**Date range (3) 92936**]) was made.
.
On the medical floor, she denies any pain or problems. She is
unable to remember any problems she had prior to becoming
obtunded.
