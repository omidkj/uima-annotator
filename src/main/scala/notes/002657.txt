Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
Severe back pain, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Sugical Incision and Drainage of the Left Elbow -twice
L2-S1 Laminectomy and Washout
PICC Line Insertion


History of Present Illness:
67 M w/ recent ulnar nerve surgery at OSH p/w severe lower back
pain and fever.  Of note, patient is a very difficult historian.
 He states that he has had chronic back pain for several years
due to spinal stenosis.  Approximately one year ago he had a
lumbar laminectomy.  He has chronic pain that he reports began
to get severe about one week ago.  His pain medication regimen
is unclear - he states that he only takes what he has with him.
His regimen used to include celebrex and colchicine, but has
recently run out of these medications and has been taking
oxycodone at times and roxicet at times.  He denies recent
trauma.  He states that one time last week he lost control of
his bowel and bladder.  He denies changes in his sensation.  He
has difficulty ambulating - uses a cane at home.
.
He had surgery on his left elbow (for ulnar nerve entrapment)
approximately three weeks ago ([**2162-7-8**]) at NEBH by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 92623**].
He states that surgery was fine without any complications.  He
has noted some drainage and redness from the surgical site, but
no overt pain.
.
He has also had fevers, chills, HA, diarrhea over the past few
days.
.
ED course: He presented with fever and otherwise normal vital
signs.  There was concern for spinal epidural abscess, and an MR
L spine was done which revealed his spinal stenosis and no e/o
infection.  He was given vancomycin for his UE cellulitis.  For
his pain he was given IV dilaudid and tylenol.
.
He currently is complaining of lots of back pain.  He states
that he took 4 of his own Roxicet in the ED without telling
anyone.
.
Review of Systems: He has been nauseous for the past several
days with decreased PO intake.  He has been a bit more SOB
recently.

.

Pertinent Results:
MRI L spine [**2162-7-25**]: No definite pathologic enhancement, though
there is extensive postsurgical change in the posterior soft
tissues of the lower back, related to lower lumbar laminectomy.
.
MRI Spine [**2162-8-3**]:
1. Marked short-term interval progression of spinal stenosis at
L2-L3, with complete effacement of the CSF space and likely
compression of all of the descending nerve roots.
2. Markedly enhancing tissue in the anterior epidural space at
the same level. A distinct posterior disc herniation is not well
visualized on this study, compared to before, although
comparison of the anterior epidural soft tissue is difficult
because the timing of contrast enhancement may be different.
3. New bone marrow edema in the L2 vertebral body, and probably
increased edema signal within the L2-L3 intervertebral disc with
partial enhancement. In addition to the findings above, this
appearance raises strong suspicion for infection superimposed on
post-operative changes.
.
TAGGED WBC [**2162-8-5**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. No definite evidence of epidural abscess,
however, sensitivity of study is decreased as patient has been
on antibiotic therapy.
2. Increased tracer activity seen in region of left elbow,
consistent with
known infection.
.
MRI SPINE [**2162-8-7**]:
1. Findings at L2-3 disc indicate discitis and osteomyelitis.
2. Anterior epidural phlegmon from L1-2 and L3 level with a
small focus of epidural abscess.
3. Phlegmon and enhancement in the left neural foramen and also
involving the medial portion of both psoas muscles and also in
the posterior soft tissues.
4. Subtle increase of signal indicating fluid in the
prevertebral region from C1-C4 level. No evidence of discitis or
osteomyelitis in the cervical region. The prevertebral area is
not fully evaluated on this study and a followup focused
cervical spine MRI is recommended for better evaluation.
.
TEE ECHO [**2162-7-30**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is mild focal
thickening of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
LEFT FOOT THREE VIEWS: [**2162-8-10**]
1. Mild soft tissue swelling about the left fifth digit without
evidence of osteomyelitis at this time.
2. Mild degenerative changes about the mid foot and small
plantar calcaneal enthesophyte.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2162-7-31**]
1. Echogenic liver likely representing fatty metamorphosis.
However, more advanced liver diseases including hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded in this study.
2. Small right posterior hepatic lobe cyst, unchanged as
compared to the prior MR examination dated [**2155-8-21**].
3. Moderate amount of gallbladder sludge, with no evidence for
cholecystitis.
4. No renal calculus or evidence for obstruction.
.
CXR [**2162-8-2**] COMPARISON: [**2162-7-25**].
Right PICC line has been placed with distal tip of radiodense
wire terminating in the proximal right atrium. This finding has
been communicated by telephone to the venous access nurse caring
for the patient on [**2162-8-2**].
Heart size is normal. Pulmonary vascularity is engorged, and
there is new bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2162-8-8**]:
A single portable image of the chest was obtained and compared
to the prior examination dated [**2162-8-6**]. There is no significant
interval change. A stable retrocardiac opacity is noted likely
reflects underlying small pleural effusion with atelectasis,
difficult to exclude pneumonia. There is mild perihilar fullness
associated with loss of definition of the pulmonary
bronchovasculature as well as vascular redistribution
