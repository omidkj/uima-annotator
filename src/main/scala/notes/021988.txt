Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
 hypercarbic resp failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation [**2158-5-30**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 10132**] is a 62F h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (dx 3 weeks ago, tx at
[**Hospital1 112**]) on cyclosporine and pyridostigmine who presented to OSH w/
chest pain, 2 weeks of calf pain, hypoxia (oxygen sat 82%),
weakness, shortness of breath and ultimately diagnosed with
DVT/PEs. She was found to have a RLE DVT and bilateral PE's with
RLL infarct. She was started on lovenox in addition to coumadin.
The patient did well initially, then on [**5-27**] she became acutely
confused with expressive aphasia, was incontinent and stopped
obeying commands. This was in setting of BP ~92/28.  Head CT
negative. MRI inconclusive due to artifact. Echo was negative
for PFO. On the evening of [**5-27**], she  developed hypercarbic
respiratory failure (pH 7.1 / pCO2 95), leading to intubation.
She was seen by Neurology at OSH who felt did not feel this was
releated to MG exacerbation and recommended against IVIG. It was
unclear at the time of discharge whether repiratory failure was
related to PE.

The patient had an episode of brief desaturation this morning to
80s ( PaO2 was > 400 on FiO2 100) during which she became more
lethargic, with ?difficulties moving her right arm. This was
felt possibly related to ventilator plugging, atelectasis, PE's
or worsening MG. By report, she was due to have head CT,
however, was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] before this could be
performed. Following this, the family requested transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] for tertiary care. At the time of transfer, she was on
pressure support ventilation 15/5, Fio2 of 40%, saturating in
high 90s.  She was sedated with propofol. Most recent ABG prior
to transfer: 7.33/60/411 on 100%.

She was also briefly on Vanc/Zosyn out of concer for PNA,
however, RLL CXR findings felt secondary to pulm infarct and
sputum culture was non-revealing. She was also treated for a UTI
with most recent negative urine culture.

NONCTRAST HEAD CT [**2158-5-29**] 8:28 PM
Two attempts were made at imaging, however, this examination is
severely
limited by patient motion. There is no evidence of acute
intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect or large vascular
territorial infarction.
There is relative hypoattenuation of the periventricular white
matter,
denoting chronic microvascular ischemic disease. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter
differentiation appears preserved. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in
size and configuration. No acute fracture is detected. There is
mild mucosal
thickening within the ethmoid, sphenoid, and left maxillary
sinuses (2:9).
Included views of the right maxillary sinus, middle ear
cavities, and mastoid
air cells are clear.
.
CXR [**2158-5-29**] 5:31 PM
Contour of the right diaphragmatic pleural surface suggests
small effusion.
At the periphery of the right lower lung is a small region of
consolidation
which could be infection or infarction. Aside from linear
atelectasis at the
left base left lung is clear. Heart size is top normal. ET tube
is in
standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm
and out of
view and right PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
.
Head CT [**2158-6-1**]: 1. No acute intracranial process, specifically
no intracranial hemorrhage detected within the limitations of
this study.
2. Evidence of chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
.
CXR [**2158-6-1**]:
There is moderate cardiomegaly. Bilateral pleural effusions are
small, larger on the right side. Adjacent bibasilar opacities,
larger on the right side, are likely atelectasis. Right PICC tip
is in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Superimposed
infection in the right lower lobe cannot be excluded in the
appropriate clinical setting.

Ms [**Known lastname 10132**] is a 62F with  h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], PE/DVT,
hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred from OSH for
further evaluation and management of respiratory failure.
.
# HYPERCARBIC RESP FAILURE: (requiring mechanical ventilation on
admission)
The patient was intubated at OSH prior to arrival to the MICU
and was in stable condition. She was weaned off the ventilator
on HD2 without complications.
The details surrounding the acute decompensation event that lead
to intubation are unclear. The patient has a chronic respiratory
acidosis which is likely from obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
It is possible that myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] played a role but her
myasthenia does not otherwise appear to be that severe. The
combination of these factors, as well another acute insult
(pulmonary embolus) may have resulted in acute respiratory
failure. However unclear why PE would have resulted in her
worsening several days after initiating treatment.  She was
extubated in the ICU here and her respiratory status improved.
Her baseline oxygen saturation levels are likely in the 88-93%
range.  Ambulatory oxyge
