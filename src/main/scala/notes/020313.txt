Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8104**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85 F with COPD on home O2, discharged on [**12-28**] after admission
for hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia, and NSTEMI post-ERCP, now
readmitted with increasing O2 requirement.  Patient had ERCP on
[**12-25**], had sphincterotomy, removal of small stone, and biopsy.
Intubated for procedure; in PACU had desats to 60s requiring NRB
for a time, leading to admission post procedure.  Course
remarkable for continued hypoxia, fever to 102, and rulein for
NSTEMI.  CXR with L sided effusion and possible infiltrate; CT
abdomen lung bases with dependent GGO concerning for aspiration.
 Treated initially with vanco/unasyn, transitioned to
levo/flagyl and discharged on this regimen (total 7 day course).
 Also received steroids x 4 days (?COPD flare component), off at
discharge.  Regarding NSTEMI, very briefly on heparin gtt,
restarted ASA and plavix (off pre-procedure); cards consulted
and thought to be demand related.  CK/MB peak 748/76, max
troponin recorded 1.08 on [**12-27**].  94% on 2L at discharge.
.
Arrived home Friday night, had dinner at [**Hospital1 18**] (no dietary
changes).  Slept well, woke Saturday morning feeling fatigued
but no specific dyspnea.  Over course of next few hours at home,
continued to feel unwell, no appetite, and had sensation of not
being able to breathe, no specific acute onset.  Went back to
bed and could not fall asleep due to dyspnea.  Denies chest pain
or fever.  Called EMS, upon arrival SBP 200, received 2 SLNTG
and lasix 80 IV.  At OSH, febrile to 102.7.  Received
ceftriaxone and transferred.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient afebrile, 151/56, P58, R22, eventually to
94% on a 50% ventimask.  Denied chest pain.  Labs notable for
troponin 3.37, CK 37, BNP 22K.  CXR with worsening edema,
pleural effusions L>R.  Cards and ERCP consulted.  Heparin gtt
started for elevated troponin.  Also received vancomycin.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 F with COPD on home O2, recent admission to hospital for
post-ERCP hypoxia thought related to NSTEMI and aspiration
pneumonia, now admitted with worsening dyspnea, elevated
troponin, and pulmonary edema.
.
# Hypoxemia.  Desat during past admission as per HPI thought due
to pneumonia, NSTEMI, heart failure.  Now returns with worsening
of dyspnea and increased O2 requirement.  This was likely due to
a CHF exacerbation (decompensated diastolic heart failure).  She
was drinking >2L of fluid daily after her recent discharge and
also was found to be hypertensive on arrival of EMS.  She was
diuresed with IV lasix and returned to her baseline respiratory
status by discharge. She ruled in for NSTEMI as below;
cardiology was consulted and the decision was made with the
patient and her family to treat episode of demand ischemia
medically (meds as below).  PE also considered, especially in
light of recent procedure/hospitalization and conjugated
estrogen use (which was held).  LENIs negative for clot and TTE
negative for evidence of RV strain.
.
# NSTEMI.  With worsening troponin as above.  Cardiology
consulted. Heparin gtt x 48 hours given.  Beta blocker titrated;
aspirin and plavix continued.  Statin increased to 80 mg daily.
In light of no focal WMA on echo (and family/patient
preference), cath not performed (still not clear if fixed lesion
vs. demand ischemia).  Will f/u with cards as outpatient for
possible stress test.
.
# Congestive heart failure, acute on chronic.  BNP elevated and
CXR with edema and effusion.  Repeat TTE performed given concern
for new infarct and showed EF 55% without WMA.  Diuresed with IV
lasix.  BB and ACEI continued.
.
# Aspiration pneumonia.  Completed a course of levo/flagyl for
recent diagnosis of aspiration PNA during prior admission.
Passed speech and swallow last admission.
.
# Possible cellulitis.  The patient was treated with 3 days of
Vancomycin in the ICU for concern of cellulitis, however, in
further discussion with the patient and her family it was felt
that the erythema over her L anterior shin was chronic and
unchanged.  Therefore the vancomycin was discontinued as the
patient was clinically well without leukocytosis or fevers.
.
# Question pleural effusion: L side appeared to have moderate
effusion
