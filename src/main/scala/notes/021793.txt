History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110101**] is a 66yo female with PMH significant for CAD,
atrial fibrillation, HTN, and ? Sjogren's, who presents with
abdominal pain and diarrhea. Per patient, her symptoms first
began back in early [**Month (only) **]. At that time she felt tired and
bloated. Her PCP thought she had a bacterial infection in her
abdomen and started her on Augmentin x 2 weeks. Her pain
improved but as a result of the antibiotics she developed a
yeast infection and was given Diflucan. 2 weeks later, she was
also started on Protonix, which she states was very helpful.
Since her insurance required pre-approval for the Protonix, she
was switched to Prilosec which was not as helpful. In addition
her Protonix, Celebrex was changed to Ibuprofen which further
worsened her symptoms.  She is not taking celebrex again.  She
also admits to nausea, which she has had for years.
.
Starting about 1 week prior to admission, she notes an episode
of increased pain and bloating.  She experienced some urgency
and noted a dark bowel movement with increased [**Last Name (un) **].  This bowel
movement also had some blood and mucus mixed with the stool.
These loose BMs resolved over the day and she returned to
regular BMs until the day prior to presentation.  She again
noted urgency and abdominal pain followed by a loose stool mixed
with blood.  This diarrhea continued for two more BMs while in
the emergency room.  She denies any fevers, chest pain, SOB,
dizziness, or recent travel. She states that her son-in-law had
a stomach virus last week. She has not had a colonoscopy or
endoscopy.
.
ROS: positive for whats noted above.  Denies fevers / chestpain
/ shortness of breath / vomiting / dysuria.  Positive for
chronic fatigue, noted since the start of these symptoms as well
as a chronic stable fatigue / decreased exercise tolerance that
has occured for years.  She also notes that she has experienced
mechanical falls for her lifetime that has been worked up by
multiple physicians.  She also noted dry mouth and decreased
tear production that is currently being workup by her PCP for
Sjogrens syndrome.

Studies:
Chest Xray:
UPRIGHT AND LATERAL CHEST:  Allowing for differences in
inspiration, the
cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed.
Pulmonary
vascularity is normal.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax.  Thoracic spondylosis is observed.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS

IMPRESSION:
1.  Fluid filled colon with mild prominence of the bowel wall.
Findings may correlate with resolving colitis.
2.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.
3.  3 mm pulmonary nodule requires one-year followup if there
are significant risk factors (i.e., history of smoking or
history of known malignancy). If there are no such risk factors,
no followup is required.
.
ABD U/S from [**2103-6-26**]
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:

The liver parenchyma is unremarkable without evidence of focal
mass.  No
intrahepatic ductal dilatation is identified and the common bile
duct is
normal measuring approximately 7 mm.  Portal vein is patent with
normal
hepatopetal flow.  Patient is noted to be status post
cholecystectomy. Limited examination of the pancreatic head and
body appears unremarkable.  A small 2 x 0.5 x 1.8 cm
peripancreatic lymph node is identified.  The aorta is of normal
caliber throughout and the spleen is noted to be slightly
prominent but within normal limits measuring approximately 13.5
cm.  The right kidney measures approximately 10.6 cm and the
left kidney measures approximately 10.9 cm. There is no evidence
of hydronephrosis or renal calculi bilaterally.  No free fluid
is noted within the abdominal quadrant.
IMPRESSION:
Unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.  No cause for pain
identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old women who presents with chronic abd pain / bloating
and possible acute process causing recent diarrhea
.
#Stroke:  On the night of admission, the patient noted the acute
onset of headache and left sided weakness.  A code stroke was
called and the patient was evaluted by the neurology team. CT
scan of the head did not show any acute event and neurosurgery
thought a bleed was very unlikely.  She refused an MRI at the
time.  She was give IV TPA by the neurologists and transfered to
the NICU.  She did well in the ICU and most of her deficits
resolved.  She has some minimal residual weakness on the left
side and a small left facial droop.  It is believed that the
event represents a thromboembolic event, likely from her Atrial
fibrillation.  After discussing with the patient and her PCP she
was started on coumidin with IV heparin during the transition.
She tolerated the coumidin well.  She will follow up with the
neurology stroke clinic.
.
#ABD pain / Diarrhea: No clear source of the abdmoninal pain was
discovered.  The patient may have been recovering from an acute
infectious etiology at the time of admission as seen on the CT
scan.  GI saw the patient while she was in the hospital and
deferred further evaluation until she was an outpatient because
of her acute neurological event.  She was started on a lactose
free diet in the hospital and given Senna and Colace.  She will
follow up with GI as an outpatient.
.
#AFib: Patient was continued digoxin.  Metoprolol for rate
control.  Due to the thromboembolic event, she was started on
coumidin in house.  She will be followed by her PCPs to monitor
her INR.  They would like a more concervative goal of 2.0-2.5.
.
#HTN: Continued metoprolol.  Decreased dose to 25 [**Hospital1 **].  Can be
titrated as needed as an outpatient.
.
#Type 2 DM: Held orals in house.  Will keep on home regimin as
outpatient.
.
#Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine
