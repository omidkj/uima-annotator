BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: This evaluation is
limited secondary to patient body habitus. The right and left
common femoral and proximal superficial femoral veins are patent
and demonstrate normal compressibility, color flow, waveforms,
and augmentation. The popliteal veins demonstrate normal color
flow, waveforms, and augmentation. The mid and distal
superficial femoral veins are not well visualized.

IMPRESSION: Extremely limited study secondary to patient body
habitus. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis within the
visualized vasculature (proximal common femoral to proximal
superficial femoral vein and the popliteal veins).

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No high-density material is seen to
suggest the presence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is
no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. Size of
ventricles and sulci is stable since prior study. Small
hypoattenuating focus along the falx is stable and may represent
a small lipoma. Osseous structures are unremarkable. Visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. A
fat-containing lesion is seen inferior to the expected location
of the parotid gland and may be consistent with lipoma. This
area had not been included on prior head CTs.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered mental status: It seems that her mental status has
been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] since discharge. It is possible that she
becasme more delerious with her recent increase in pain meds,
had decreased Po intake which lead to pre-renal ARF and
worsening renal function lead to worsening mental status and
volume overload given decreased UOP in the setting of being
intravascularly dry. This in conjunction with possible UTI may
have lead to her worsening mental status. CT head negative. No
focal neurologic deficits on exam.
- Treated for UTI with meropenum given h/o of klebsiella
sensitive to only zosyn and meropenum with addition of
vancomycin
.
# Hypotension: Difficult to get blood pressure given body
habitus. Had dificulty getting A lines in past. Anesthesia
placed aline [**2167-1-4**]
.
# UTI: UA appears positive but not much differnt from UA on [**12-22**]
after treatment which grew yeast.
- treated empirically for klebsiella with meropenum awaiting
culture data with addition of vancomycin after hypotensive
episode [**2167-1-4**]
.
#left knee pain
-xray neg for fracture or dislocation
.
# ARF: Likely pre-renal in the setting of dehydration. Baseline
Cr 1.0.
.
# Hypoxia: Likely [**1-22**] atelectasis and L pleural effusion.
Unclear why she was put on 100% NRB as it does not seem that she
needs this. Will wean O2 to keep O2 sats 90-95%. She does not
tolerated Bipap but has know sleep apnea
.
# Sacral ulcers:
- Wound care
.
# CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI
The patient was made CMO in the ICU after communication wit
