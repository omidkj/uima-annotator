ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old
male, with a history of end-stage liver disease secondary to
hepatitis C cirrhosis with multiple hepatocellular
carcinomas, who had been awaiting a liver transplant and had
actually been admitted to the hospital towards the end of
[**Month (only) **] for elective orthotopic liver transplantation, but
unfortunately secondary to an inappropriate donor, Mr.
[**Known lastname 17391**] liver transplantation was cancelled.  Notably, the
patient had a heavy history of alcohol use and polysubstance
abuse including IV drug abuse, but he had been free of these
for at least 14 years.

He represented on [**12-6**] after a suitable donor had been
found for elective orthotopic liver transplantation.  At the
time of his admission, the patient's white blood cell count
was 2.5 with a hematocrit of 32.  His PT was 13.8.  His INR
was 1.2, and his PTT was 31.4.  His platelet count was 118.
His admission sodium was 144, with a potassium of 3.9.  His
chloride and bicarb were 109 and 25, respectively, with a BUN
and creatinine of 20 and 1.0.  His glucose was 124.  His
total bilirubin was 0.8 with an ALT and AST of 45 and 88.
His alk phos was 92.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, and on the
evening of the [**12-6**] he underwent an orthotopic
cadaveric liver transplantation using the piggyback
technique.  The portal vein was anastomosed to the portal
vein with a common bile duct to common bile duct anastomosis,
and a celiac duct patch into the donor branch patch
anastomosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and
there was no note of intraoperative complication.  The
patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively
for ventilatory support and intensive monitoring.  The
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course was as follows:

1. NEUROLOGIC:  Neurologically, the patient's pain was
   controlled with a variety of combinations of intravenous
   and oral narcotics.  His chronic low back pain continued
   to be an issue throughout his hospitalization, but prior
   to his discharge we were able to sustain him on a regimen
   of methadone 5 mg po bid, in addition to 5 mg of oxycodone
   q 6 h as needed for breakthrough pain on top of his
   Neurontin he had been taking.  The patient's pain was
   controlled adequately with this regimen.

Notably during late in the second week of his
hospitalization, the patient developed mental status changes
which were characterized by increased lethargy and difficulty
in rousing the patient.  He was transferred immediately to
the Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation, and after a
thorough work-up which included CT scan of the head which
showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, it was felt
that this was most likely secondary to cyclosporin toxicity
along with the narcotics that the patient had been receiving.
The patient recovered from this quite well, and prior to his
discharge he was alert and oriented, completely lucid, and
otherwise had no neurologic deficits and, as noted, had good
pain control.

1. RESPIRATORY:  The patient was supported with a ventilator
   in the initial postoperative period from which he was able
   to wean successfully without complication.  Notably, he
   did develop bilateral pleural effusions throughout the
   course of his hospitalization, but after diuresis, these
   effusions significantly improved.  The patient otherwise
   had no significant pulmonary complications.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's cardiovascular status was
   tenuous in the initial postoperative period requiring some
   vasopressor support with Neo-Synephrine, but after
   adequate volume resuscitation in the immediate
   perioperative period, we were able to wean off
   vasopressors, and the patient was able to maintain an
   adequate blood pressure with peripheral perfusion pressure
   without any sort of pharmacologic support.  We were able
   to restart the patient's beta blockade for
   cardioprotection and management of his hypertension, and
   he tolerated his Lopressor doses well without any
   complication.

1. GI:  The patient's liver transplant was actually quite
   successful.  Follow-up biopsies evidenced no evidence of
   acute cellular rejection, and the patient's liver function
   tests continued to remain steady and within normal limits
   throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.  His
   course was notably complicated by some stenosis and
   thrombosis of the portal vein which required angiography
   with thrombolysis and stenting secondary to acutely rising
   LFTs on [**2140-1-3**].  The patient tolerated this
   procedure well, and after successful stenting and balloon
   dilatation via angiography, the patient's liver function
   tests improved and stabilized.  The patient's
   postoperative course was notably complicated by a
   persistent ascites leak which was discovered on [**12-20**], [**2139**] after bedside exploration, and a fascial wound
   dehiscence was discovered.  This required reexploration in
   the operating room with repeat closure, which the patient
   again tolerated well.  His wound was subsequently cared
   for with a combination of wet-to-dry dressing changes and
   placement of a wound VAC.

1. FEN:  The patient's nutritional status continued to be a
   problem given his malnourished state at the onset, along
   with his postoperative complications of pneumonia and
   wound dehiscence.  He was initially given TPN until return
   of bowel function, and subsequent to that time, as it was
   felt the patient could not take in adequate oral intake
   without supplementation to sustain himself, postpyloric
   feeding tubes were placed, and he was started on
   supplemental enteral nutrition via tube feeds, which he
   continued up until one day prior to the end of his
   hospitalization.  These tube feeds were administered, as
   noted, through a postpyloric feeding tube.

The patient's renal status remained steady, and his
creatinine remained around its baseline of 1.0, although
while in the Intensive Care Unit, in the second week
postoperatively, he did develop acute renal failure which was
felt to be secondary to drug toxicity and intravascular
volume depletion.  His renal function though did recover to
its baseline without long-term complication.

1. HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient did suffer from blood loss
   anemia for which he was transfused appropriately.  His
   coagulopathy was corrected with a combination of fresh
   frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate.  Prior to discharge,
   his PT and INR had normalized.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's main infectious disease
   issues included a left lower lobe pneumonia, for which he
   was treated appropriately with broad-spectrum antibiotics
   including Zosyn.  He never evidenced any sort of
   bacteremia, nor did he ever have a urinary tract
   infection.  Notably, he was colonized with VRE, although
   there was never any focal infection with this, and
   patient's MRSA screens were negative.  The patient's wound
   grew out E. coli.

Regarding patient's immunosuppression, after the standard
initial postoperative course, he was maintained on
cyclosporin and
