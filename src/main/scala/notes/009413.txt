Admission Date:  [**2168-10-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-11-9**]


Service:  CCU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Acute myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
woman with no known coronary artery disease who reported not
feeling well to her sister this morning.  Her sister found
her to be weak but without chest pain or shortness of breath.
She was taken to the [**Hospital6 33**] where an
electrocardiogram showed inferior and right-sided myocardial
infarction.  She was taken to the catheterization laboratory
there, where she was found to have three vessel disease with
total occlusion of left circumflex artery, total occlusion of
right coronary artery and diffusely diseased left anterior
descending.  Her coronary artery was stented times three and
an intraaortic balloon pump was placed for hypotension.
Subsequently, she went into ventricular fibrillation arrest
and was intubated and converted to sinus rhythm with
defibrillation.  She was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.  At
the outside hospital she received heparin, Integrilin,
lidocaine, digoxin and transiently dopamine.  No aspirin was
given due to allergy to aspirin.  Echocardiogram done in
[**2168-4-10**] showed an ejection fraction of 65-70% and
normal wall motion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, sprue and rheumatoid
arthritis.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Viokase, Norvasc 5 mg q.d., Lipitor
20 mg q.d., Synthroid 15 mcg q.d., arthrotec 15 mg q.d.,
hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg q.d., Aleve 2 tablets q.a.m.,
prednisone taper 5 mg.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient's sister, [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 1356**], is her
health care proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] lives alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.  Pulse 50.  Blood
pressure 70/40, saturating 100% on assist control
ventilation.  In general, patient is intubated.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Pupils reactive to light but
sluggish.  Cardiovascular:  S1, S2.  Lungs clear anteriorly.
Abdomen soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
 Right groin arterial and venous sheaths, intraaortic balloon
pump left groin.  Extremities:  Cool, peripheral pulses by
Doppler.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 63, left axis
deviation, Qs in III, aVF, T wave inversion in II, III, aVF,
ST depression in V2, V3, normal QRS.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 13.1, hematocrit 27.7,
platelets 606,000, PT 13.7, PTT 71, INR 1.3, sodium 137,
potassium 4.4, chloride 107, bicarbonate 14, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 196. CK 4401, AST 254, ALT 784, total
bilirubin 0.3.

Chest x-ray showed appropriate placement of balloon pump,
endotracheal tube.  Pulmonary vasculature slightly engorged.
No effusions or infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Coronary Care Unit, patient
initially had a poor urine output, low blood pressure
requiring pressors, occasional paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
requiring procainamide drip and one time DC cardioversion,
has a bradycardia requiring administration of atropine.
However, over the course of a few days, she was successfully
weaned off pressors, had satisfactory urine output and the
bradycardia resolved.  Her cardiac enzymes also trended
downwards.  Additionally, there were no more episodes of
atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac echocardiogram done on [**10-26**] showed an ejection fraction less than 25%, severely
depressed left ventricular and right ventricular function, no
RA, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, small to moderate pericardial effusion.  She
was successfully extubated on [**10-28**].  She required some
supplemental oxygen post extubation, but was eventually
weaned off all supplemental oxygen.  She continued to receive
Plavix and aspirin.  Results from a repeat echocardiogram on
[**11-3**] were unchanged from the previous one.  Lopressor
and captopril were slowly added to her regimen.  She had a
hematocrit drop on initial presentation, requiring two units
of packed red blood cells.  Her stool was trace guaiac
positive.  It was thought to be due to blood that she had
swallowed during intubation.  Over the course of her stay,
her hematocrit stabilized.  Additionally, she had spiked a
fever of up to 101 and was empirically started on vancomycin.
 Her initial blood cultures, as well as her surveillance
cultures were negative and the antibiotic was discontinued.
She did not spike a fever since that initial episode.  Post
myocardial infarction, she was confused including not
oriented to place, but oriented to time and person.  A head
CT was negative.  Psychiatry and Neurology were consulted and
their opinion was that the mental status changes were due to
anoxic brain injury.  Over the course of her stay in the
hospital, there was some improvement in her mental status,
however, she was not at her baseline.
