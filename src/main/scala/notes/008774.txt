SYMPTOMS: NONE


INTERPRETATION: 52 yo man (h/o atrial fibrillation, 3-vessel CAD

with multiple PCIs, ischemic cardiomyopathy) was referred to
evaluate an
atypical chest discomfort and shortness of breath. The patient
completed
6.5 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Known firstname **] protocol representing a limited to fair
functional exercise tolerance for his age; ~ 7 METS. The
exercise test
was stopped at the patient's request secondary to marked
fatigue. No
chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported. In the
presence of
the course atrial fib and digoxin therapy, no obvious ECG
changes were
noted from baseline. The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with no
vea
noted during the procedure. The blood pressure increased with
exercise.

IMPRESSION: Fair functional exercise tolerance. No anginal
symptoms or
obvious ECG changes from baseline. Nuclear report sent
separately.


EXERCISE MIBI  [**2172-9-9**]

EXERCISE MIBI

Reason: CHEST PAIN ? ISCHEMIA

RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
10.9 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2172-9-9**]);
28.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2172-9-9**]);
HISTORY: 52 yo male with known history of CAD referred for chest
pain
evaluation.

SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

Exercise protocol: [**Known firstname **]
Resting heart rate: 60's
Resting blood pressure: 112/80
Exercise Duration: 6.5 mins
Peak heart rate: 120's
Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 71 %
Peak blood pressure: 140/60
Symptoms during exercise: None
Reason exercise terminated: Fatigue
ECG findings: AFib

METHOD:

Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Tracer was
injected approximately one hour prior to obtaining the resting
images.

At peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of
Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi
was administered IV. Stress images were obtained approximately
one hour
following tracer injection.

Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT

This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

INTERPRETATION:

The image quality is good.

Left ventricular cavity size is severly dilated.

Resting and stress perfusion images show a large, severe, fixed
perfusion defect
invloving the apex, distal lateral, distal inferior and distal
anterior wall.
There is also a small, mild, fixed perfusion defect involving
the septum.

Gated images reveal global hypokinesis. The apex, distal
lateral, distal
inferior and distal anterior wall cannot be evaluated due to
absent counts.

The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 23 %.

IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal study.
2. Large, severe, fixed perfusion defect invloving the apex,
distal lateral,
distal inferior and distal anterior wall.
3. Small, mild, fixed perfusion defect involving the septum.
4. Severly dilated LV.
5. Global hypokinesis; LVEF 23%.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] [**2172-9-9**] at 1355.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old man with history of CAD/PTCA, MI, Afib, alcohol
abuse presenting with chest pains on transfer from OSH.

At [**Hospital1 18**], his INR was improved after Vitamin K/FFP from OSH. His
chest pains were subsided on morphine, banana bag, and nitro
drip.

Problems:

Cardiac:
--CAD:
Chest pains on admission: serial cardiac enzymes were negative.
ECG with no significant changes from prior ECG, showing previous
QS morphology on V1, V2 suggestive of anteroseptal infarct, and
non-specific T-wave abnormalities.  Chest pain was relieved with
morphine, nitro drip with good effect. Maintained on
atrovastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, lisinopril for afterload
reduction. On hospital day two, he had an echo which
demonstrated previously noted anteroseptal infract,
