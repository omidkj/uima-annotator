Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2111-10-13**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63M with ALS, HIV on HAART with undetectable VL
(per pt), hepatitis C, recent diagnosis of esophageal
adenocarcinoma admitted to [**Hospital 2725**] Hospital from home on [**10-10**]
with left sided weakness, slurred speach, and altered mental
status. He was evaluated by [**Month/Year (2) **], head CT negative, head
MRI/MRA with old small vessel disease with no acute infarction.
[**Month/Year (2) 878**] thought may have been TIA or possibly worsening of
ALS. He was felt to be close to baseline and discharge planning
started. Then on the evening of [**10-12**] when eating a [**Location (un) 6002**],
telemetry alarmed for 2 minute episode of ventricular
tachycardia per report (rhythm strip not included in OSH
records). RN responded and found patient with mouth full of
food, cleared airway, patient started taking shallow breaths,
was diaphoretic and complained on non-specific pain. There were
no compressions or shocks administered as he spontaneously
converted to SR. EKG after the event reported to have ST
elevation V1-V4.  He informed the ICU team that was having chest
pain on transfer. He was started on amiodarone (150mg load and
1mg gtt), heparin (4000u bolus and gtt), lopressor 5mg IV,
aspirin 325mg once, lasix 40IV.  He was placed on BIPAP with ABG
7.29/71/209 on 100%FiO2. There is documentation that labs showed
troponin of 0.5, lactate of 5.3.  Blood cultures obtained.  He
was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin for presumed
aspiration pneumonia.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he reports that he feels at his baseline health. He
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, slurred speech,
diplopia. He does not recall the events of the previous night.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING / STUDIES:
# Portable TTE ([**2111-10-13**] at 11:45:20 AM):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
# Cardiac Cath ([**2111-10-13**]):
*** Not Signed Out ***
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically significant epicardial coronary
artery disease. the LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were without
angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent epicardial coronary artery
disease.
2. Systemic arterial normotension.
.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2111-10-19**] at 2:55 AM):
FINDINGS: There is no evidence infarction, hemorrhage, mass
effect, edema, or shift of normally midline structures.
Ventricles and sulci are prominent, suggestive of parenchymal
involution. Periventricular white matter hypoatte
