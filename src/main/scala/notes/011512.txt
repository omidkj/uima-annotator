History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9700**] is a 74 yo female with no known history of CAD and no
risk factors for CAD, who presented to the outside hospital with
approximately 24-hour history of persistent, constant back pain.
She described her pain as diffuse over her upper back,
non-radiating, not related to position change, [**4-26**] in

became [**9-26**]. She developed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and
orthopnea, no dizziness. She went to the emergency room on [**7-31**]

dissection. EKG showed ST elevations in anterior precordial
leads. CK 194, CKMB 24, index 12, TropT 0.131. She was given
ASA, Plavix, b-blocker, morphine and was started on heparin,
integrillin and nitro drips. The patient was then tranferred to
the [**Hospital1 **] for urgent catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization [**2173-7-31**]:
Cath [**2173-7-31**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed two-vessel disease.  The LMCA had mild proximal
irregularities.
The LAD was totally occluded proximally.  This artery was
identified
as the infarct-related artery.  The LCX and its branches were
free of
flow-limiting stenoses.  The RCA had a mid 70% stenosis.
2.  Post-angiographic hemodynamic evaluation revealed moderately

elevated right-sided pressures (mean RA was 11 and RVEDP was 14
mmHg),
severely elevated left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 26 mmHg),
and
moderately elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 48/24 mmHg).
The
cardiac index was severely reduced at 1.9 L/min/m2 (using an
assumed
oxygen consumption index).
3.  Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 x 23 mm
Cypher
drug-eluting stent with rescue of a jailed diagonal branch with
a 1.5 mm
ACE balloon. Final angiography demonstrated no residual
stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 2+ flow (See PTCA

Comments).

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2173-8-2**]:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately
depressed (EF 35-40%). Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include septal and distal anterior and apical
akinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed 2 vessel disease (LAD totally
occluded proximally and mid RCA 70% stenosis). LAD was stented
with 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher stent, and a jailed diagonal branch was
rescued with a 1.5 mm ACE balloon. Final TIMI 2+ flow. The
patient was then admitted to the CCU service.

1. CAD - The patient was started on Aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor,
Metoprolol, Captopril. She remained on integrilin drip for 18
hours following catheterization and then was continued on
heparin drip. She had remained angina-free for the remainder of
her hospital stay. She had no new EKG changes and no significant
events on telemetry. Beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor doses were
gradually maximized based on blood pressure and heart rate.
Metoprolol and Capropril were then changed to the corresponding
once daily doses of Toprol XL 150 mg po qd and Lisinopril 10 mg
po qd on the day of discharge. The patient's blood pressures
were checked prior to her discharge and were in 120/80 range.
Lipid panel was checked. LDL and total CHOL came back high, 157
and 281, respectively. LFTs were WNL except AST elevation that
was thought to be related to release of enzymes from the
myocardium. Her right groin site checks revealed no
complications.

2. CHF - Echocardiogram revealed EF 35-40% with septal, distal
anterior and apikal akinesis. Based on the echo results, it was
felt that 8 weeks of oral anticoagulation are indicated for this
patient. The patient was started on Coumading 5 mg po qd and was
bridged with unfractionated heparin during her hospitalization.
On the day of discharge her INR was still subtherapeutic 1.1.
She was discharged home with Coumadin and was instructed to have
her INR checked in 2 days and Coumadin dose adjusted by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 6359**].

3. Disposition and follow up - The patient was discharged home
with visiting nurse services who will be following her BP.
Follow up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6359**] (her new PCP) was
scheduled for [**2173-8-6**]. The patient was given a prescription
slip to have her INR and K level checked prior to her
appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6359**]. We emphasized to the patient the
importance of follow up for her coumadin dose adjustment. She
will also need follow up LFT checks as she was started on
Lipitor. The follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], cardiologist
in [**Location (un) 3786**], was also made for the patient. She will need a repeat
echocardiogram in one month after discharge. We discusse
physical activity limitations with the patient and her daughter
over the phone.
