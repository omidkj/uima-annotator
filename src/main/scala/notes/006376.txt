Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2154-2-9**]  1:27:34 PM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Poor R wave
progression
suggest prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Non-specific
ST-T wave
changes. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2154-1-24**] there is no significant diagnostic change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-2-11**] 10:09 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-6**], there is little
overall change. Some prominence of the cardiac silhouette and
interstitial markings is again seen. The increased opacification
at the left base is again consistent with some atelectatic
change in the retrocardiac region.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2154-2-16**] 12:50 PM
CONCLUSION:
1. Large bibasilar effusions with increased interstitial
markings and ground glass opacities throughout both lungs
suggestive of pulmonary edema from fluid overload or CHF.
2. No central or segmental pulmonary emboli, however, given the
extent of effusions and passive atelectasis, subsegmental
pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes cannot be excluded.
3. Abdominopelvic ascites with no evidence of abscess.
4. Postoperative changes in the upper abdomen in keeping with
recent laparotomy. Stable pneumobilia and intra-hepatic biliary
dilatation.
5. Subcentimeter hypodensities in the liver and left kidney
likely represent cysts or hemangiomas.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-2-18**] 9:04 AM
IMPRESSION: No significant changes in moderate right and small
left pleural effusions. Bilateral parenchymal opacification
predominantly apical distribution is atypical for pulmonary
edema and pneumonia is another consideration.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2154-2-18**] at 10:37:50 AM
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 74 year old male with painless obstructive jaundice.
He went to the OR on [**2154-2-5**] for:
Total Pancreatectomy with Splenic Preservation and Open
Cholecystectomy.

Pain: He had an epidural for pain control. He was then switched
to a PCA and once tolerating clears, was started on PO pain
meds.

GI/Abd: He was NPO, IVF and a NGT. Per the Whipple pathway, the
NGT was removed on POD 3. His diet was slowly advanced along.
His incision was C/D/I with staples in place. His abdomen was
soft and nontender. He did not have a drain in place.
He was on TPn for nutritional support. This was weaned off as he
was able to tolerate a regular diet. We encouraged a diet with
supplemental shakes.

Post-op Hyperglycemia: He was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] to blood sugar
management. He was getting Lantus qhs and a Humalog sliding
scale.

Post-op Hypotension/Hypovolemia: The early morning of
