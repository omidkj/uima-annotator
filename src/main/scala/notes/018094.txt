Cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-proctocolectomy
-Tracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old man with CAD s/p PCI w/ BMS to LAD
and LCx on [**2146-11-4**] with a recent diagnosis of colorectal
cancer with plan for bowel resection today. However, he
developed cardiac arrest during surgery requiring defibrillation
and subsequently found to have ST elevations on EKG. Patient had
apparently stopped both plavix and aspirin on [**11-30**] prior to his
surgery today. Per report, patient became hypotensive on
pressors with MAP in 40s and tachycardic to 120s after prone
jackknife positioning. Rhythm was identified as ventricular
tachycardia. He was flipped back supine and got CPR for ~10
minutes, including Epi, Vasopressin, Atropine, a shock for
transient VF, and a femoral CVL, with return of pulse and
pressure. ABG immediately after was 7.24/36/391/16 w/lactate
7.2. He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where TEE showed global LV
hypokinesis and a normal RV, while the rhythm strip showed large
ST elevations anteriorly. Troponins were greater than
recordable. He was put on a heparin gtt and amiodarone bolus and
was brought to the cath lab emergently on afternoon of [**2146-12-6**].

.
In cath lab was found to have thrombotic LAD stent with no flow,
and thrombotic Cx stent with TIMI 3 flow. Received Export to LAD
and CX and POBA to both. RFA Perclose. He received a Heparin
bolus and Plavix load in the cath lab and a Swan-Ganz was
placed. His heparin ggt was turned off and he returned to the OR
to complete proctocoletomy with open perineum and diverting
ileostomy. He was transferred to the trauma SICU
post-operatively and was cooled via Artic Sun protocol, and has
since been rewarmed. Also has received 2 units PRCs on [**2146-12-7**]
for HCT of 29, and 1 dose of vanc/zosyn for post-op ppx.
.
Today he was noted to be dropping his pressures, so returned to
cath lab to have balloon pump placed and angiogram which
confirmed patency of vessels. Upon transfer to ICU, he is on
levophed ggt, neo ggt, milrinone and vasopressin ggt. He is also
on fentanyl/versed ggt's for sedation. He is anuric with a Cr of
2.7 (baseline 0.9). Renal is following.

STUDIES:
.
CARDIAC CATH [**12-6**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Stent thrombosis of CX and LAD stents.
2. Successful 2 vessel thrombectomy and balloon only
angioplasty.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Primary angioplasty to LAD and Cx.
.
ECHO [**12-6**]:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic
function. Cannot assess regional RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed with near global LV severe hypokinesis/akinesis; the
basal septum and basal lateral wall have relatively preserved
function (overall LVEF= ~15-20 %). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal with grossly normal free wall contractility. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The aortic valve is
not well visualized.

EKG [**12-6**]:
Probable sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate. P-R
interval
prolongation. Fusion of the P wave with the prior T wave. There
is a
single wide complex beat, probably ventricular. Low limb lead
voltage.
There is an intraventricular conduction delay of left
bundle-branch block type with prominent inferior and lateral ST
segment elevation. Since the previous tracing of [**2146-11-5**] the
rate is faster. The axis is more vertical.  QRS complex is
wider. ST-T wave abnormalities are new. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
.
ECHO [**12-8**]:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 %). There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall
of the right ventricle. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo male with CAD s/p LAD/LCx BMS in [**10/2146**] presenting with
STEMI in setting of stopping asa/plavix prior to colorectal
surgery, s/p cardiac arrest on table, on IABP, pressors, CVVH.
Of note, the patient had no meaningful improvement and serial
family meetings were held. Aware of the poor prognosis and
believing that the current maximal supportive care including
pressors, mechanical intubation, and IABP would not meet the
patient's wishes, family decided to withdraw support and pt was
taken of pressors, balloon pump, and was extubated.  He expired
shortly there after at
