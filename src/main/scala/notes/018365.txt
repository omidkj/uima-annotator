History of Present Illness:
86 y.o. female.  Admission in mid [**Month (only) **] for septic left
shoulder(MRSA), discharged to rehab on Vanco via PICC and now
presents (after an initial work-up at [**Hospital6 **]) with
change in mental status, dislocated left shoulder, and decreased
urinary output.  She was transferred at the request of her
daughter given that she receives most of her care at [**Hospital1 18**].  She
was A/Ox3 at home. She was found to have +UTI, 6 of 6 bottles of
gram negative rods, Negative Head CT. Vancomycin was continued
dosed by level and levofloxacin given empirically.  Her shoulder
pain responded well to low dose morphine.  On [**7-13**] went to
surgery for shoulder debridement, irrigation and placement.  On
[**7-14**]  transferred to MICU overnight for hypotension, GI bleed
(had guaiac + black stool), refused c-scope, now Guaiac
negative. Gram negative rods determined to be Enterobacter, [**7-15**]
meropenem started.  Pt's mental status markely improved
throughout the course of the Abx and post-surgical intervention.
 She will needed extended Abx tx as an outpt and significant PT
follow-up for her shoulder.  To be placed in Rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 86 year-old female recently admitted in mid [**Month (only) **] with
septic L shoulder (coag + staph) on vanco via Picc, s/p left
shoulder washout and TEE negative for endocarditis.  Admitted
from [**Hospital1 756**] after found to have UTI and altered MS and
transferred here at request of daughter and found to have L
shoulder dislocation, reduced 1 at [**Hospital1 112**] and 2 at [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  At
nursing facility patient also found to have altered mental
status, decreased urine output, and azotemia.

Mental status change/ID: Subsequently, patient found to have
Enterobacter bacteremia with sensitivity only to meropenam.
Patient's mental status improved significantly with IV
antibiotics with some baseline waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].  Recently Mrs.
[**Known lastname 101651**], in addition to her medical issues, suffered the loss of
her husband.  This grieving and possible depression has lead to
some withdrawal.  Would recommend appetitite stimulants,
possible anti-depressants at discretion of physicians at
[**Hospital1 **] to help with mentation.
 **Most importantly, patient will need continued vanco for MRSA
until [**2123-7-29**] and meropenem Enterobacter Cloace until [**2123-8-24**].
She has been blood culture surveillance negative since initial
cultures and has been afebrile with declining WBC.

Shoulder dislocation: s/p debridement, open anterior
reconstruction, and aspiration
of her left shoulder joint now in sling.  Patient's course has
been very complicated, with multiple dislocations, now a chronic
dislocation and severe pain.  Ortho at [**Hospital1 18**] feels that
continued surgical options are limited and recommend sling, with
good pain control.  Patient will need further evaluation, most
likely at [**Hospital6 **] for further options of
management.

CHF with EF 55% with diastolic dysfunction:  Patient with
respiratory distress during this admission.  Gentle diuresis of
Lasix 20 mg PO every other day has kept her in good fluid
balance.  Currently her blood pressure has dropped to 80's/40/s
with good response to fluid but she has maintained hemodynamic
stability after her GI bleed (see below)

GI bleed with anemia: patient hemodynamcially stable, with
stable crits after a brief lower Gi bleed, likely secondary to
diverticulosis -guaiac +, black stool, but patient did not want
colonoscopy.  Her goal crit is >30.

Atrial fibrillation: Has been in sinus on amio. Not on coumadin
secondary to Gi bleed.

CAD: h/o abnormal pMIBI in [**2120**]. Had intermittent Chest pain on
[**7-12**] with ECG demonstrating t-wave inversions in anterior leads.
Per cards fellow, patient was not ruled out, ASA held due to
bleed.  Beta-blocker maintained, with occasional holding for low
BP's. will not rule out. holding ASA secondary to bleed.  Now
stable, without chest pain or associated symptoms.

Pain: pain is now well controlled on current regimen.  Would
recommend continuation.

Nutrition: Patient with decreased PO intake over past 2 days
prior to disch
