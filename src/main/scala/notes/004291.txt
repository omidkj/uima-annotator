PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.7, heart rate 94, blood
pressure 160/88, respiratory rate 24, sating 82% on room air,
90% on a nonrebreather.  In general the patient was
somnolent, but arousable.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Large
conjunctival hemorrhage.  Oropharynx is dry.  Cardiovascular
holosystolic murmur.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs
decreased breath sounds to the left base.  Abdomen positive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities
left fistula thrill, right lower extremity edema.  Right toe
necrotic with eschar.  No evidence of cellulitis or pus.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12.2,
hematocrit 39, platelets 293, 83% neutrophils, no bands, 12
lymphocytes, 8.5 monocytes, 1.9 eosinophils, 4 basophils.
Chest x-ray demonstrated a right lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram sinus at 62, normal axis, normal intervals,
peaked Ts in V2, left ventricular hypertrophy, flat T wave
laterally, no ST changes [**2154-5-10**].  No disease on
catheterization per report.  No findings in computer.  [**4-17**]
echocardiogram EF 60%, trace MR, trace AI.  [**5-15**] AK popliteal
to posterior tibial.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Renal:  The patient was continued on
dialysis with management of volume status by the renal
consult team.

2.  Right toe ischemia:  Vascular surgery was consulted,
imaged the right lower extremity.  Once the patient's other
issues (see below) are resolved the patient was taken for a
right great toe amputation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was treated
with perioperative broad spectrum antibiotics and will be
discharged to physical therapy rehab.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient was found to have a pneumonia in
the right lower lobe.  He was monitored in the Intensive Care
Unit for his hypoxemia.  He was intubated on [**6-4**] for hypoxic
respiratory failure.  He was treated with Ceptaz, Vancomycin
and Azithromycin, which was switched to Zosyn, Azithromycin
and Vancomycin until [**6-6**] when his regimen was switched to
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone until [**6-7**] when Flagyl was added.
At that time he required Dopamine for a drop in systolic
blood pressure to the 80s after being given Levofloxacin.  He
was intubated approximately two days and then had an episode
of hypertension to 240 and chest pain.  He ruled out for
myocardial infarction and was started on antihypertensives.
On [**6-5**] the patient underwent a bronchoscopy with BAL
demonstrating no gross findings and 2+ PMNs with gram
positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  On [**6-8**] he underwent
thoracentesis where 600 cc of dark yellow fluid was removed
consistent with transudate.  The patient was extubated and
called out.  He underwent a noncontrast CT to look for
obstruction cause for pneumonia, but no evidence of
obstruction seen.  In addition, video swallow study was done,
which was normal.

The patient was continued on a 14 day
course of antibiotics.  He will follow up with his primary
care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who is also the patient's attending
during the hospital course with repeat CT scan to ensure
complete resolution of the infection.  The patient remained
afebrile with adequate O2 sats in the low 90s on room air.

4.  Endocrine:  The [**Last Name (un) **] Service was following the patient
for management of his diabetes.

5.  Code:  Full.

obstruction, aspiration risk or anatomical abnormality.  No
specific organisms isolated.
4.  Hypertension.
