Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]

Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right lower extremity wound vac change [**2161-6-16**].


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97372**] is a 72 y.o. M with CAD s/p CABG in [**2144**], CHF (EF
20% in [**2157**]), and complete heart back, pacer dependent, who
presents to ED for RLE wound evaluation.  The patient was
recently admitted to the Vascular Surgery service from [**6-5**] for RLE pain x 1 day and difficulty ambulating.  He
was diagnosed with compartment syndrome and on [**6-6**] had a R leg
3-compartment fasciotumy.  Post-operatively, he was extubated
and transferred to the CVICU.  On [**6-8**], he had a wound vac
placement. His CKs trended from [**Numeric Identifier 35553**] to 2291.  His RLE
improved.  His hospitalization was complicated by significant
hematuria for which urology was consulted. He was discharged
with CBI with plans to remove at rehab if UOP clears.
Additionally, he had an episode of acute on chronic systolic
dysfunction and responded to lasix IV.  He was transferred to
VICU for further monitoring, and then to the medical floor where
he progressed with mobility.  He was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

The patient was sent from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after medical staff noted
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab. This started overnight prior to admission.  [**Name8 (MD) **]
MD, he needed more frequent dressing changes (2 ABD pads)
overnight due to blood.  Usually, SBP 110-150 but with transfer
to chair, his SBP declined to 70-80s once during [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
stay.  On admission to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, T 100.4 and cultures
continue to be NGTD with UCx negative.  Plan for hematuria was
to do hand irrigation or CBI once clear UOP.

In the ED, initial VS: T 98.8  HR 88  BP 114/74  RR 16  O2 95%
RA.
Labs and active T&S were drawn, significant for hyponatremia of
129 and stable Hct from discharge of 27.1.  Leukocytosis
trending down from recent hospitalization.  Lactate 1.6.  Blood
cultures x 2 were obtained.  EKG and CXR were obtained.
Vascular surgery was consulted, and they changed the dressing
and removed the vac.  VSurg placed a wet-to-dry dressing and did
not note any oozing from the wound.  The patient was given ASA
325 mg po daily x 1, Vancomycin 1 g IV x 1, Acetaminophen 1 gm
po x 1, and Zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1.

In the ED, the patient was noted to drop his SBP to 68/45 mostly
while sleeping (per ED), but SBP 97-145s when awake. Rectal
temperature 100.4. 1 L IVFs were given with 2nd liter hanging.
RIJ was placed and confirmed.  Per ED signout, patient with dry
MM. PE without any localizing symptoms.  Pt still with CBI from
rehab.

Currently, the patient does not complain of pain.  He asks for
pain medication if his Foley is to be changed. He did note
feeling lightheaded at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab when he first started
working with PT. He also noted increased bleeding from his RLE
wound overnight.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.
Denies BRBPR and melena, hematochezia.

.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis: No soft tissue hematoma seen. There is mild
dilatation of bilateral renal collecting systems, possibly due
to marked distention of the bladder, which is from instillation
of saline or clamping of the Foley which was requested prior to
CT scan. The non-enhanced bladder otherwise appears
unremarkable. There may be urethral diverticulum. There is
marked prostatic enlargement.  There is flattening of the IVC
when compared to the study of [**2161-6-5**], which can be seen in
hypovolemic states. Clinical correlation is recommended.
Cholelithiasis. Coronary artery disease.

pCXR: There has been interval removal of the right IJ central
line. The AICD/biventricular pacing device is unchanged. Mild
cardiomegaly is unchanged. The enlarged mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. There are low lung volumes bilaterally.
New small left pleural effusion is noted. Old right lateral rib
fractures are again noted.

Right leg ultrasound of fluid collection: 5 cm distal right
lower extremity subcutaneous fluid collection. Diagnostic
considerations include infected fluid collection versus evolving
hematoma. Correlate clinically

Echo ([**6-16**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 45 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
fat pad.  Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2157-9-21**], the left ventricular
cavity is smaller and global systolic function has improved.
Aortic regurgitation is no longer seen and the severity of
mitral regurgitation is reduced.
