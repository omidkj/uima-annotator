Admission Date:  [**2149-10-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2149-11-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2083-12-2**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiogenic shock, status post acute
inferior myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male with
a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease (status
post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2147-5-22**],
status post right coronary artery stent times two in
[**2148-9-21**], and status post percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery
in [**2149-7-21**]) who presented with 10/10 chest pain
(persistent pressure similar to his past acute myocardial
infarction) starting around 8 o'clock in the morning on the
day of admission.

He was seen in his primary care physician's office and was
sent to the Emergency Room directly.  In the Emergency Room,
his temperature was 98.3, blood pressure was 183/65, pulse
was 94, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen saturation was
97% on room air.  His initial electrocardiogram was
unremarkable.  He was given sublingual nitroglycerin for his
chest pain.  However, in the Emergency Room, his systolic
blood pressure dropped to the 50s and heart rate went down to
the 40s.  His repeat electrocardiogram showed high-grade
atrioventricular block with acute inferior myocardial
infarction.  He was given atropine and dopamine for
bradycardia and hypotension in the Emergency Room, and he
went into supraventricular tachycardia.

He was brought to the catheterization laboratory directly for
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  During the
catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon was placed for blood
pressure support, and he was intubated for airway protection.
He also required pressors including Neo-Synephrine and
dopamine during the catheterization.  A transvenous temporary
pacing wire was also placed during the catheterization.  His
proximal right coronary artery (which was totally occluded
with thrombus) was successfully stented with normal flow.  At
the end of the catheterization, his heart rate remained
stable off pacer, and blood pressure remained stable off
pressors.  He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post 3-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2147-5-22**]; status post right
coronary artery stent in [**2148-9-21**]; and status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left
anterior descending artery in [**2149-7-21**].
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin 75/25 50 units q.a.m. and
30 units q.p.m., Imdur 10 mg p.o. t.i.d., Cozaar 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  ACE INHIBITOR (cough).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He stopped smoking five years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Denies coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission to catheterization laboratory revealed
temperature was 96.9, blood pressure was 136/71, heart rate
was 133.  In general, intubated and sedated, responsive to
painful stimuli.  Cardiovascular examination revealed normal
first heart sound and second heart sound, tachycardic.  Lungs
revealed breath sounds were equal bilaterally.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities revealed
distal pulses bilaterally by Doppler.  Left groin arterial
and venous sheaths with intra-aortic balloon pump and
Swan-Ganz catheter.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 9.6, hematocrit was 48.4,
platelets were 179.  PT was 13.5, PTT was 25.5, INR was 1.3.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 95,
bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 9, creatinine
was 0.7, and blood glucose was 414.  Calcium was 8.7,
magnesium was 1.5, phosphate was 4.2.  Albumin was 3.9, total
bilirubin was 0.7, ALT was 20, AST was 14, alkaline
phosphatase was 85, lipase was 13, amylase was 24, LD
was 196, creatine kinase was 45 (which later peaked at 1081).
Arterial blood gas revealed 7.31/47/358 on ventilator with
FIO2 of 0.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations
in II, III, and aVF; ST elevations in I and aVL; right-sided
electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in leads V2 through
V6.

Catheterization in [**2148-9-21**] revealed 3-vessel
coronary artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal.  Total occlusion of saphenous vein graft
to right coronary artery.  Normal ejection fraction of
about 60%.  Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stenting of the distal right coronary artery
and direct stenting of the mid right coronary artery.

Catheterization in [**2149-7-21**] revealed 2-vessel coronary
artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal.  Severe diastolic dysfunction.  Successful
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 80% left
anterior descending artery stenosis just distal to the
anastomosis.  Ejection fraction was about 70%.

Catheterization on admission revealed left main coronary
artery was normal, left anterior descending artery with
severe proximal disease, left circumflex was nondominant with
total occlusion of the first obtuse marginal.  Right coronary
artery was dominant vessel with proximal total occlusion with
thrombus.  The proximal right coronary artery was
successfully stented.  Right heart catheterization showed
right atrial mean pressure of 19, pulmonary artery pressure
of 57/40, with a mean pressure of 49, wedge of 28.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was weaned off pressors and intra-aortic
balloon pump quickly in the Coronary Care Unit.  Metoprolol
and Cozaar were added as his blood pressure tolerated.  The
18-hour course of post catheterization Integrilin had to be
stopped prematurely due to epistaxis.  He also developed
severe laryngeal edema secondary to traumatic intubation on
admission.  He was evaluated by Ear/Nose/Throat and treated
with a dose of intravenous Solu-Medrol with significant
improvement.  He was extubated on hospital day five without
any difficulty.  He was also treated with a 7-day course of
Levaquin for possible aspiration pneumonia given the
prolonged course of intubation and a low-grade temperature.

His cardiac enzymes trended downward throughout the hospital
stay with a peak creatine kinase of 1081 and CK/MB of 125.
Repeat echocardiogram showed inferoseptal hypokinesis with an
ejection fraction of 55%.  No evidence of ventricular septal
defect.

On the day of discharge, he was evaluated by Physical Therapy
and deemed stable to go home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.
