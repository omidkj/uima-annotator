History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 y/o M with CMML who was admitted on [**2200-4-2**] at
[**Location (un) 5871**] for splenic rupture where he underwent emergent
splenectomy on [**4-2**], course complicated by intra-abdominal staph
infection. There is no discharge summary available but per the
patient the procedure was without complications, no pressor
requirement per operative report. Culture of hematoma revealed
coagulase negative staphylococcus with multiple resistances but
sensitive to vancomycin. He was started on vancomycin for this.
Per pt he also had diarrhea related to c. diff infection and
flagyl was started. He was discharged from the OSH to complete a
course of vancomycin and flagyl. Since discharge the patient
reports that he has generally remained somewhat tired and
occasionally has felt some soreness in his ankles. This morning
he reports feeling much more tired and noticed that,
intermittently, he has felt some shortness of breath. No
associated chest pain or diaphoresis. The patient was taken by
hospital to the oncology clinic. There he was afebrile and
hemodynamically stable; however, his O2 saturation was noted to
be 90 on room air. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital.


Currently the patient reports he doesn't feel short of breath
except with exertion. He believes his diarrhea has resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 73 year old man with CMML with recent admission to OSH
for emergent splenectomy after splenic rupture who is admitted
for hypoxemia and worsening bilateral ground glass opacities.
He was treated aggressively on the floor with antibiotics and
other etiologies (PE, MI, etc) were appropriately addressed.  He
was fluid resusitated and continued on his CMML regimen.
Despite this, the patient became progressively hypotensive and
was transfered to the ICU for further care.

In the ICU the patient continued to deteriorate and developed
progressive hypotension and acidosis despite aggressive fluid
repletion, pressor support, and bicarbonate drip. He received >
8L NS, 8amps bicarb, pressor support w/ levophed and
vasopressin, and maximum ventilatory support. Despite these
measures, his lactate continued to trend upwards and he became
progressively more hypotensive on the PEEP settings required to
adequately oxygenate him. Furthermore, the patient developed
tumor lysis syndrome in the setting of his chemotherapy and
became anuric producing only 40cc of urine over 8hr. Renal
service was called emergently to consider dialysis but the
family elected to change his code status to DNR/DNI and focus
care on comfort as a priority, after discussion w/ his
oncologist Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] and to defer more aggressive therapy.
