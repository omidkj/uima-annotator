History of Present Illness:
 61y/o M w/ DM2, CHF s/p ICD, CRI, and atrial fibrillation
presenting today with altered mental status and hypotension. The
patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] with a
perirectal abscess complicated by hypotension and a MICU
admission. His course was further complicated by renal failure
and a transaminitis attributed to unasyn therapy. He was
discharged to a rehab facility on [**1-10**] and had recently left
that facility and returned home last week. According to his
wife, he has been more sedated since discharge from the hospital
but otherwise has been doing relatively well at home. He
endorses chronic knee and LE pain but denies any recent CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, N/V, poor PO intake, progressive weakness,
paresthesias, HA, melena, or BRBPR. He has noticed some
intermittant painless shaking in his hands that has occasionally
caused him to drop objects. He and his wife note good compliance
with his medications though she had held his coreg until
yesterday given slow HR at home. She feels that his altered
mental status can be directly attributed to the doses of
narcotics that he was discharge on as this was a new medication
for him. He has been eating well at home but did not take good
PO today despite receiving his regular dose of insulin.
.
Today he presented to a neurology appointment for further
evaluation of his hand shaking and there was noted to be
somnolent. His blood pressure was in the 80s systolic and he was
sent to the ED for further evaluation. There he was seen to be
bradycardic to the low 50s and somnolent. His glucose level was
33 and he received D50 and promptly awoke and was appropriate
per report. His bradycardia was treated with atropine to which
his HR increased to the 70s and his relative hypotension
(systolic ~90) improved. EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reportedly felt
that no intervention was indicated at this time. He was admitted
to the ICU because his HR dipped to the low 50s for ~25 seconds
and it was felt that he merited intensive monitoring.

.
CXR: 1. Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.  2. Ill-defined
retrocardiac opacity, likely reflects atelectasis. However, if
there is a clinical suspicion for pneumonia, recommend repeat PA
and lateral views after diuresis.
.
RUQ u/s: 1. The liver demonstrates no focal or textural
abnormality.
2. The gallbladder contains sludge. No definite stones or
evidence of acute cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old man with CHF (EF 20%) and Afib admitted for altered
mental status and hypotension.
.
# HYPOTENSION: Found to have BP of 80/60 at Neurologist's office
and then sent to the ED. In the ED, he got atropine with
improvement of his heart rate and his BP. In the MICU, his BP
ranged from 100-110/65-85. The thought is that he was
bradycardic and had decreased cardiac output resulting in low
BP.Not infected so not likely septic hypotension. Peripherals
warm and well perfused so not likely cardiogenic hypotension.
Patient was monitored on telemetry. Heart rate and BP remained
within normal limits for duration of inpatient stay.  Patient
was restarted on coreg and diovan prior to discharge with good
blood pressure control and normal heart rate.
.
# BRADYCARDIA: Found to have heart rates in the 40's in the ED.
Received atropine with improvement. In the MICU, coreg held and
HR ranged from 60-80. Unclear why he became bradycardic when
he's been taking coreg chronically. He has ICD with pacemaking
capabilities; threshold set to 40. EP was consulted regarding
threshold setting and felt no changes needed to be made. Patient
was restarted on coreg without difficulty. Continued on digoxin.
Monitored on telemetry with no events.

.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Likely from hypotensive episode, or
from narcotics. Resolved.
.
# HYPOGLYCEMIA: Fingerstick was 33 at ED. Responded to D50.
Unclear why hypoglycemia. Possibly from poor PO intake at home,
although he denies. Possibly from incorrect insulin dosing,
especially since he recently switched brands of novalog.
Restarted on  NPH 5 units in AM decreased from prior regimen of
NPH 15units QAM/8units QPM. Covered with Humalog sliding scale.
FS monitored and had good control for duration of stay.

.
# CHF: Non ischemic cardiomyopathy with acute exacerbation of
congestive heart failure and EF 20%. Currently volume overloaded
with elevated JVP to jaws, peripheral edema and crackles in
lungs. Initailly treated with IV lasix for diuresis and
transitioned to PO regimen of 80 mg daily with improvement in
peripheral edema and lung exam. Directed to maintain low salt
diet, and check daily weights. Restarted on coreg and diovan
.
# Atrial fibrillation: in afib currently w/ rate ~ 80s.
Continued coumadin, digoxin, restarted coreg with good effect.
.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: at baseline.
.
# LFT elevation: Elevated since previous admission in setting of
both unasyn reaction and stones in the CBD. He is s/p pancreatic
stenting and stent removal. LFTs trended downward. Possible
contribution from liver congestion from CHF. RUQ obtained to
evaluate for stone which was negative.
.
# Myoclous: Intermittently has shaking movements of his left
arm. Arranged to have outpatient neurology follow up.
