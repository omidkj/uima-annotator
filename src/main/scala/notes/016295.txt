Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2173-12-17**] - Pericardectomy
[**2173-12-14**] - Cardiac Catheterization
[**2173-12-10**] - Pericardial Window
[**2173-12-9**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 year old woman with history of PAF,
hypertension who presents with shortness of breath. The patient
has had some sob and cough since [**2173-11-15**], when she was admitted
to St E with chest pain (sharp, substernal, pleuritic,
non-positional), shortness of breath and fatigue found to be in
new afib and started on coumadin. At that time an ETT was
negative and she completed a r/o MI. She was hypoxic at that
time requiring 4-6L of nasal cannula. On [**2173-11-18**] she had a CTA
chest that showed small bilateral pleural effusions and
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis w/o evidence for PE. On [**2173-11-19**]
she had a tte ef>70% and trivial pericardial effusion. She
subsequently saw her cardiologist (at [**Hospital3 5097**]) who stopped
coumadin as has converted to sinus. She saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-3**]
cough, sob, abd pain CT abd -> bilat effusions, small pericard
effusion and started on levoflox. She represented to her PCP
with worsening shortness of breath and fatigue and was referred
to the ED. She is very mildly short of breath and her cough is
dry. She only gets mild chest pain with coughing.
.
ED COURSE: Initial vital signs were 100.4 75 88/54 24 96%4L. She
transiently dipped her blood pressure to 80s which responded
slowly but well to 2L IVF. She also received 1 dose of empiric
decadron for adrenal insufficiency. She had a CTA that was
negative for PE but showed pericardial and pleural effusions as
well as mediastinal fat stranding. A formal TTE was done as well
which showed no tamponade physiology. CT surgery was consulted
with regard to the fat stranding and recommended getting
cultures of the effusions if possible. She received ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.
.
ROS: weight stable, prior abdominal bloating is gone. no rash.
no joint pain, no muscle pain. her last colonoscopy was 1year
ago and was normal. never been on steroids. no tanning of skin.
chronically constipated but had black stools 3 days ago. had
been drinking very little for the past week.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus @70. nl axis and intervals. no ST-T changes. compared
to
CXR:
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right.
2. Mild enlarged cardiac silouhette, with a slight globular
appearance.

CTA chest:
1. Moderate sized pericardial effusion with stranding in the
mediastinal and epicardial fat concerning for mediastinitis.
Given this finding, clinical correlation for infected
pericarditis is recommended. Given the early phase of imaging,
enhancement of the pericardium will not be detectable on this
study.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
with
associated compressive atelectasis.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
4. Right thyroid nodules and calcifications. Clinically
correlate.

TTE: [**2173-12-8**] - Normal left atrium size. No ASD. Right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) RV
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Mildly
dilated aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but no aortic stenosis. No AR. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No MVP. Physiologic MR. Moderate
[2+] TR. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. Small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Pericardial
constriction cannot be excluded.

TTE [**2173-12-9**] - Overall LV systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is
abnormal septal motion. Small, echodense pericardial effusion.
The pericardium appears thickened. The echo findings are
suggestive but not diagnostic of effusive-constrictive process.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small echodense pericardial effusion without echo
signs of tamponade. Probable effusive-constrictive physiology.
If clinically indicated, a cardiac MR ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5098**]) or right
heart catheterization is recommended to investigate for
constrictive physiology.

TTE [**2173-12-10**] -  Pre-pericardial window:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. Simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. Aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No AR
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No MR
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
8. Small pericardial effusion measuring 1-1.2cm located
primarily along the inferior and inferior-lateral aspects of the
heart. The pericardium appears thickened. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
9. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left.
.
TTE Post-pericardial window:
1. Biventricular function is preserved.
2. The size of the pericardial effusion has decreased to 0.5 cm
along the inferior-lateral position.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions are no longer evident post-chest
tube placement.
