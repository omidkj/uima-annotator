Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old female who
was found to have an "abnormal electrocardiogram" on routine
physical examination for which she was referred for further
workup.  Echocardiogram performed in [**2142-10-23**] revealed
ASD for which she was referred for ASD closure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 78, normal
sinus rhythm.   Patient's weight is 150 pounds.  Blood
pressure 111/55.  General:  No acute distress, appearing
stated age.  Skin:  No rashes.  Well hydrated.  HEENT:
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Normal
buccal mucosa, no dentures.  Neck:  Supple, no
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention, no tracheal
deviation, and no thyromegaly.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, positive S1, S2, no
murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
normal bowel sounds, no guarding, rebound, or rigidity.
Extremities:  Warm, positive mild bilateral lower extremity
edema.  No cyanosis and no calf tenderness.  Neurologic:
Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  Positive
mild lordosis due to pain when walking from history of fallen
arches.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  75, normal sinus rhythm, within normal
limits otherwise.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a history as noted above.
Echocardiography report done in [**Month (only) 359**] was consistent with a
large atrioseptal defect with a dilated right atrium and
right ventricle along with a large amount of left to right
flow, which was consistent with interatrial septum with
paradoxical septal motion.

The patient was taken to the operating room on the same day
of admission, [**2142-12-28**] at which time a minimally invasive
atrial-septal defect repair was performed without incident.
At the time of surgery, the patient had a chest tube placed.

Postoperatively, the patient did well and was extubated
without event.  The patient was subsequently admitted to the
CSRU for careful observation.  The patient remained in normal
sinus rhythm and was urinating adequately.  Kefzol
perioperatively was continued postoperative day one.

The patient subsequently was found to be doing quite well and
her central line, A line, and Foley were discontinued.  The
patient was placed on Lopressor.  She was found to be stable
on postoperative day #1 in the pm and subsequently
transferred to the Cardiac Surgical floor, where she
continued to do well and the chest tube was taken out on
postoperative day #2 without event.

Physical therapy also had seen the patient and deemed her
safe for discharge to home.  No further physical therapy was
needed at the time.  The patient was discharged and
instructed about complications to look for.
