lb.  General:  The patient was an obese gentleman with a
large abdomen, dry scaly skin of the
bilateral lower extremities.  HEENT:  Normal buccal mucosa.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed left ventricular
hypertrophy in sinus rhythm at 88.  There was some slight ST
elevation in V1-V3.  This was consistent with his
presentation for likely acute anterior myocardial infarction.

The patient was seen by  the CT Surgery Service and admitted
to be worked up for coronary artery bypass grafting and
aortic valve replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  On [**2135-9-22**],
went to the Operating Room and underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times one with saphenous vein to the left
anterior descending, as well as aortic valve repair with #21
mm [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve.  This was done under
general endotracheal anesthesia.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72**] assisted Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in this procedure.  He left the Operating Room with an
arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter and intra-aortic balloon
pump which was placed in the right groin intraoperatively,
two ventricular and two atrial wires, two mediastinal and one
left pleural tube.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 160 min
with a cross-clamp time of 87 min.

The patient came out with a mean arterial pressure of 71,
with a CVP of 15, and PAD of 27.  He was being AV paced at a
rate of 74.  He was on Dobutamine at 10 mcg/kg/min, Levophed
0.07 mcg/kg/min, Insulin drip at 6 U/hr, and Propofol at 10
mcg/kg/min.  On postoperative day #.., the patient's
inotropic support was serially weaned.  He was ultimately
started on slow diuresis.  Beta-blockers were added slowly.

Postoperatively he was out of bed ambulating.  His chest
tubes were discontinued on postoperative day #3.  Ultimately
the patient went to the floor by postoperative day #3.  He
was otherwise deemed well and tolerating a diet.  His pacing
wires were removed.  Lopressor, Lasix, and Aspirin were
titrated.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation was obtained to control his
blood glucose.  He was started back on his preoperative NPH
regimen.  His blood glucose immediately was controlled.

By postoperative day #6, the patient was deemed appropriate
and stable for discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 20
mg p.o. b.i.d., x 5 days, K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. x 5 days,
both of these medications are to be reviewed as an outpatient
to be compared to his preoperative Lasix requirement,
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Percocet 5/325 [**12-1**] tab p.o. q.[**3-5**]
p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Insulin 70/30 [**3-5**] U in the
morning, 12 U in the evening, sliding scale Insulin as
directed.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should consume a
diabetic, heart-healthy diet, and have Accuchecks q.i.d. with
a goal blood glucoses to be between 120 and 160.
Additionally the patient should be out of bed and ambulating.
He should received chest physical therapy every six hours as
needed.  Wound checks should be performed, and drainage
should be reported to the on-call Cardiothoracic Surgery
house staff.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
approximately 2-3 weeks from the time of discharge.  He can
pursue cardiac rehabilitation at the aforementioned
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times one,
saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, as well as
aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve as stated above
completed on [**2135-9-22**], done for critical AS, as well
as coronary artery disease.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
