Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Heart Catheterization on [**2183-12-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

History of Present Illness:
63yo female with a h/o congenital heart defects (s/p repair
primum atrial septal defect, cleft mitral valve with an
endocardial cushion defect), afib on coumadin, pulmonary artery
HTN, DM, HLD who p/w 1mo shortness of breath, lower extremity
edema, and orthopnea.  On day of adission, patient presented to
Cardiology visit with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4135**] today for a scheduled
appointment regarding her pulmonary hypertension.  At the visit
patient reported the above symptoms, and under went a TTE for
evaluation of pHTN, which demonstrated PA pressure of 80mmHg
(prior was 36mmHg) and severe TR.  At the time, her vital signs
were HR45 BP150/60 99%RA.  Patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
admission for treatment of heart failure and elevated pHTN.
.
In the ED, patient's initial vital signs were 99.1 42 164/48 20
100% 4LNC.  EKG showed afib at 46.  CXR c/w CHF. Labs were
significant for HCT 31.8, Cr 0.9, Trop<.01, BNP 2646 (no
baseline comparison).  Patient received 20mg IV lasix w good
urine output (not recorded).
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen
in the body of the left atrium. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification versus annular ring from prior
repair. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-11**],
the RV appears enlarged with evidence of pressure/volume
overload. There is now severe pulmonary hypertension and the
degree of TR has increased. The mean transmitral gradient is
similar.

[**2183-12-8**]
CCath
1. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
2. Moderate right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
3. Marked elevation in PCW consistent with severe left
ventricular
diastolic heart pressure, with giant V waves consistent with
significant
mitral regurgitation.
4. Mild improvement in PASP, mean PA and modest improvement in
PVR with
100% O2 and slightly further with addition of iNO, driven by
narrowing
of AV O2 difference.

TEE
Mild spontaneous echo contrast but no thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium and left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
right atrium or the right atrial appendage. The right atrial
appendage ejection velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta to 35
cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened and there appears to be
prosthetic material in the mitral valve annulus consistent prior
surgery. There is a 3 mm Hg mean gradient across the mitral
valve, with an estimated valve area of 2.3 cm2, consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened with moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Trivial mitral stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild spontaneous echo contrast without
thrombus in the left at
