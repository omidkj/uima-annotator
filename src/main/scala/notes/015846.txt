HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 76-year-old man with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis with a history of atrial fibrillation and
history of CHF who presents with left fifth fingertip ulcer
and cellulitis.  There was no evidence of osteomyelitis and
no obvious evidence of acute infection, although the patient
was started on Zosyn 2.25 grams IV q. eight to cover for
Pseudomonas.  Blood cultures were sent and the patient was
treated with wet-to-dry dressings q.d.  All diabetes and
medications for his end-stage renal disease were continued.

The patient was noted to be subtherapeutic for his atrial
fibrillation and thus was given an additional dose of
Coumadin.  Goal INR was [**1-23**].

Of note, during the hospital course, the patient was noted to
have elevated blood pressures and his metoprolol was
increased to 125 mg b.i.d.  Otherwise, issues remained
stable.

The following day, the patient had an episode of nausea and
vomiting times one but no abdominal pain.  A chest x-ray and
a KUB were ordered.  The KUB did not demonstrate obstruction
or free air.  The chest x-ray demonstrated a new left pleural
effusion with probable increase in heart size, pleural
plaques, and calcification.  Since the pleural effusion did
not have any obvious etiology, it was determined that
eventual thoracentesis would be needed, but at this time
there was still concern that the finger ulceration could be
due to an emboli, thus an echocardiogram was ordered and the
patient was continued on Zosyn.

The plastic surgeons who specialize in hands were consulted.
In addition to concern for embolic phenomenon, Transplant
Surgery was consulted because of possible vascular steal
phenomenon in the setting of his AV fistula in that arm,
although it has been present for years.  The patient also had
upper arterial Dopplers performed on [**2102-3-15**].

The patient continued to be asymptomatic at this time, and
antibiotics and local management were continued.  A CT of the
chest was ordered to further evaluate the pleural effusion.
The CT suggested question of a left hilar mass as well as a
layering pleural effusion as well as known pleural plaques
that remained stable.

Transplant Surgery, after reviewing the duplex of the left
arm which showed a stenotic proximal AVF just distal to the
arterial anastomosis, determined that the patient would go to
the OR on [**2102-3-16**] for Perma-Cath placement as well as
ligation of the AV fistula because this was resulting in a
steal syndrome and arterial insufficiency.

The patient went to the OR on [**2102-3-16**] and was noted to have
a complicated course.  Following the AV fistula ligation and
the Perma-Cath insertion under MAC anesthetic, the patient
had airway obstruction and hypoxia.  Thus, he was converted
to general anesthesia.  At this time, his rhythm changed from
sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with hypotension
requiring boluses of Neo-Synephrine.  The patient was also
given Lopressor 50 mg and Esmolol 50 mg for rate control.  At
the end of the case, the patient was breathing spontaneously,
but it was determined that the patient should be kept
intubated.

He was transferred to the PACU and was stable.  At that
point, a Neo drip was started.  Cardiology and the Medicine
Team were contact[**Name (NI) **] and it was decided to cardiovert the
patient at the bedside in the PACU since it was a controlled
situation.  He was given one shock at 200 joules, and
promptly converted to sinus rhythm.  A chest x-ray done in
the PACU demonstrated a large pleural effusion but there was
concern for hemothorax since [**08**],000 units of IV heparin was
given intraoperatively.  A chest tube was placed by the
surgeons and 850 cc of slightly serosanguinous fluid was
drained.

The patient was then transferred to the SICU for monitoring
following his AV ligation, Perma-Cath placement, DC
cardioversion for atrial fibrillation as well as chest tube
placement.  By [**2102-3-17**], the patient was off
Neo-Synephrine and the patient was extubated without
difficulty.  At this point, Surgery recommended the
discontinuation of the Zosyn and he was transferred to the
floor.  The chest tube was discontinued on [**2102-3-18**].
The patient eventually received a bed on [**2102-3-18**] on
the floor, continued to do well without complaints but was
noted to be back in atrial fibrillation on the EKG, but had
no symptoms and was maintaining his blood pressure.

At this point, the pleural effusion had been drained via the
chest tube by the surgeons, cytology results were still
pending.  The patient continued hemodialysis and was being
continuously anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation.  The
patient did remain on Zosyn, althoug
