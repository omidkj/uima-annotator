[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal regional LV systolic
function.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma
in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Severe
AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. Pericardium appears
thickened.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person
of the results on [**2112-2-25**] at 1430 .
POST CPB:
1. Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.
2. Bioprosthesis in aortic position. Well seated and stable with
good leaflet excursion.
3. Trace AI. PG = 18 mm MG = 8 mm Hg.
4. Intact aorta.
5. Dynamic mitral regurgitation, transiently [**2-13**] + with fluid
administration without any hemodynmaic instability, wmas'S or
change in SVO2
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2112-3-3**] 2:45 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 yo man with heart block. Asess atrial and ventricular lead
s/p PPM
Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the pacemaker placement.
PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to
[**2112-2-28**].
The pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right
atrium and
right ventricle allowing the technical quality of the study. The
patient is after replaced aortic valve. Cardiomegaly, large left
and small right pleural effusion are unchanged as well as there
is no change in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. No
pneumothorax is currently present.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with a history of acute
myocardial infarction
admitted to [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital.  Echo revealed moderate aortic
stenosis.  The patient had a cardiac catherization and found to
have severe left main disease and was, therefore, transferred
down from [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] to [**Hospital1 771**] for coronary artery bypass grafting and
possible aortic valve replacement.  He was taken to the
operating room on [**2112-2-26**] and had an
aortic valve replacement with a 25-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna
bioprosthesis, coronary artery bypass grafting x1, with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery and subtotal pericardiectomy from phrenic to phrenic due
to   constrictive pericarditis.  See operative note for full
details.  He was transferred to the intensive care unit in
stable condition.  He was extubated on post operative day 1 and
continued on Neosynephrine for hypotension.  Postoperatively
he was transiently in sinus rhythm, then went into a complete
heart block and was  pacer dependent. Attempts to decrease
pacing rate results in unreliable underlying ventricular escape
rhythm (up to 30 bpm, occasional not present at all). EP was
consulted for need for PPM placement. He lost 100% sensing and
capture with the epicardial pacing wires and a temporary
ventricular wire was placed with good capture. He was taken on
[**2112-3-2**] for a permanent pacemaker placement.  See procedure note
for full details.  He was being 100% paced with good capture and
weaned off Neosynephrine after placement.

Of note, the patient has a history of chronic left pleural
effusion.  Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended a
formal decortication.  He needs to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11482**]
[**Name (STitle) **] in [**3-16**] weeks to determine the t
