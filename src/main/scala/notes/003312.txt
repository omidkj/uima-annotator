Pertinent Results:
Pre-bypass:
1. The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass: AV paciong. On infusion of phenylephrine.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. No AI;
systolic gradient is trivial. Ascending graft visible in the
aortic positoion. No dissection seen. Aortic contour is normal
in the descending aorta. Biventricular systolic function is
preserved.

Final Report
TWO-VIEW CHEST OF [**2113-3-23**]

COMPARISON: [**2113-3-21**].

INDICATION: Evaluate pleural effusion in postoperative patient.

FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance
compared to
previous postoperative radiographs. Small pleural effusions,
right greater
than left, are unchanged from the two most recent radiographs.
Minor
atelectatic changes persist at the bases. On the lateral view,
retrosternal
gas and fluid is likely related to the recent sternotomy. Due to
patient
obliquity, it is difficult to exclude small loculated anterior
hydropneumothorax, but no visible apical pleural line is evident
on the
corresponding frontal view. High-grade compression deformity in
the mid
thoracic spine is unchanged since the preoperative study.

IMPRESSION: Small pleural effusions, right greater than left
with adjacent
basilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2113-3-20**] where he underwent Bentall procedure
as well as ascending aorta and hemi-arch replacement.  See
operative note for further details.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. He awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without difficulty. Weaned off Nitroglycerin.
Beta-Blocker/Aspirin/Statin/diuresis was initiated. Preoperative
meds were resumed. All lines and drains were discontinued in a
timely fashion. POD#1 he was transferred to the step down unit
for further monitoring. Physical therapy was consulted to
evaluate mobility and strength. He continued to progress
although he was not able to be weaned off of supplemental oxygen
completely. As discussed with his pulmonologist, Mr.[**Known lastname **]
continued his inhalers and diuresis, and would require O2
arranged for discharge to home. Postoperatively he had transient
hyponatremia requiring free water restriction and diuresis to
correct his electrolytes. On POD# 6 he was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
for discharge to home. All follow up appointments were advised.
