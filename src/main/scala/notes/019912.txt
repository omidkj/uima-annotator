Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Multiple thoracic laminotomies from T3 to T12.
2. Fusion T3 to T12.
3. Instrumentation T3 to T12.
4. Total vertebrectomy of T8-9.
5. Fusion T7 to T10.

History of Present Illness:
59M with diabetes, parkinson sent in from [**Hospital3 **] for
back pain and compression fractures.  The patient is
non-ambulatory at baseline x 5 years [**2-3**] chronic knee issues,
and had been at [**Hospital1 **] Rehabing a shoulder dislocation. He
started developing back pain s/p several forceful transfers 3
weeks ago. A T-Spine XR on [**1-19**] at [**Hospital1 **] showed possible
Fracture, and he was transferred to Caritas [**Hospital3 **] (
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **]) where he had an MRI that showed severe compression
fracture at T8 with less severe compression at T9, with complete
obliteration of intevening joint space.  It also showed
retropulsed fracture fragments producing effacement of 60% of
the AP diameter of the spinal cord.   He was then sent from [**Hospital 28941**] to [**Hospital1 487**], who then transferred the patient here.
.
Of note, 5 years ago the patient tore his left quadriceps tendon
which has required 6 lifetime surgeries, with a course that has
been complicated by MRSA infection of his wound. He is left
without control of his left knee and is non-ambulatory. He fell
in [**Month (only) **] and tore his right rotator cuff. He fell several more
times and dislocated his shoulder. He delayed going to the
hospital and wound up with a septic shoulder ([**2111-11-26**]), c/b
abscess in his right axilla and biceps. He only recently
finished Cipro and vanc [**2112-1-5**].
Discharged back to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Hospital1 487**], [**Hospital1 **] sent her
here.

.
In the emergency room, initial vitals were 98.1 137/67 60 14 93%
on RA.  The patient was evaluated by ortho spine who recommended
anterior and posterior repair.  He was admitted to the medicine
service for preoperative cardiac risk stratification.

Past Medical History:
- Parkinsons Disease
- DM
- Basal Cell CA s/p resection
- HTN
- Septic R shoulder (stopped abx on [**1-5**])
- Failed quad tendon repair on L knee (multiple surgeries
complicated by infection)

with MI, stomach CA and lung CA on mother's side.

IMAGING:

CT C-SPINE [**2112-1-21**]:
1. Destruction of T8 vertebral body with retropulsion into
spinal canal. Erosion of superior endplate of T9. Epidural
fluid, paraspinus mass. Constellation of findings most
consistent with discitis osteomyelitis. Tumor is a diagnostic
consideration but considered less likely given the involvement
of two contiguous vertebral bodies.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Thyroid goiter.
4. Segment VII hepatic hypodensity, incompletely characterized
on this exam.

CXR [**2112-1-21**]:
AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: A
PIC line enters the chest from the left, can be traced as far as
the mid SVC. Lung volumes are quite low and there is vascular
crowding at the lung bases particularly the right, but no focal
pulmonary abnormality. Heart size exaggerated by low lung
volumes is top normal. Rightward deviation of the trachea in the
neck could be due in part to low lung volumes but suggests an
adjacent mass effect, such as a large left thyroid lobe, as
confirmed by the thoracic spine CT reported separately, which
also showed small pleural effusions not apparent on this
conventional radiograph. The study and the report were reviewed
by the staff radiologist.

EKG [**2112-1-22**]: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

KNEE XR 3 VIEWS [**2112-1-25**]:
1. Findings suggestive of prior surgery for a quadriceps tendon
injury, with current patella baja configuration.
2. Moderate medial and patellofemoral joint space narrowing.
3. Periosteal new bone formation about distal femur. The
differential
diagnosis includes changes related to osteomyelitis (subacute,
chronic or old)
and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
4. No focal ostelysis or acute periosteal new bone formation to
confirm the
presence of osteomyelitis, but soft tissue infection or early
osteomyelitis
might not be apparent radiographically.

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**2112-1-26**]:
There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation in the
bilateral subclavian and right internal jugular, axillary,
brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins. Mild subcutaneous edema
is present.  IMPRESSION: No
