Reports
[**2159-6-2**] CXR:
Cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure. Probable small
bilateral pleural effusions and left basilar atelectasis.
.
[**2159-6-4**] CXR:
Increasing confluent opacities within the left mid lung zone and
right lower lung zone may represent pulmonary edema given the
rapid onset with the differential being infection or aspiration.

.
[**2159-6-5**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mid- and distal anterior and septal akinesis, as well as
inferior hypokinesis and probable akinesis of the true LV apex
(segment incompletely visualized). The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, most
c/w multivessel CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-1-4**],
there is more prominent anterior/septal regional LV dysfunction
and the overall LVEF is lower. The other findings are similar.
.
[**2159-6-6**] Video Swallow:
Several episodes of penetration and aspiration with
administration of thin
liquids. The study and the report were reviewed by the staff
radiologist.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
85 year old Russian-speaking woman p/w worsening systolic CHF,
course complicated by aspiration pneumonia, s/p abx and
diuresis, ready for discharge to rehab
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Patient was admitted
with SOB and hypoxia with signs of fluid overload on
exam/imaging and an markedly elevated BNP.  Course was
complicated by a stay in the CCU for a lasix drip to treat
hypoxia in the setting of failure.  Patient was subsequently
diuresed with improvement in resp status and transfer back to
the floor.  Diuresis was also complicated by an episode of
hypotension thought to be secondary to over diuresis and
scheduling of medications; decreased dosing of spironolactone
and isosorbide mononitrate, and spread out administration of
medications to decrease risk of hypotension during the daytime.
The remaineder of her CHF regimen (carvediolol, digoxin and
losartan) was continued unchanged.
.
# Recurrent Aspiration PNA: During hospital course patient was
found to have RLL infiltrate.  Vanco/cefepime was started for
treatment of presumed aspiration PNA.  Video swallow showed
unpreventable silent aspiration with all fluid consistenc
