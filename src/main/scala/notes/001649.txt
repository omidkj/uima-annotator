Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, weight gain, decreased O2 sats

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78yo F with h/o severe AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2), CAD s/p PCI,
diastolic dysfunction with EF on last TTE >55% admitted with
dyspnea. Patient was recently admitted in [**9-8**] for similar
symptoms and was found to be volume overloaded on exam. She
received lasix and her Imdur was stopped as well and she
improved clinically. At that time she also had some atrial
tachycardia that was treated with a beta blocker and increased
dose of diltiazem. She was discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**] where she was
progressing with physical therapy. She then developed abdominal
pain and diarrhea and was re-admitted. She had negative CDiff
toxins X 3 and was sent home on an empiric course of
cipro/flagyl and plan for o/p colonoscopy after CT showed
colitis. While admitted she had an episode of hypotension as
well as AV-Junctional rhythm on telemetry. Because of this her
beta blocker was discontinued and her diltiazem dose was
decreased. She was then seen by her cardiologist on [**10-10**] and
was restarted on her metoprolol at 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. She was continued
on her diltiazem at 60mg TID. She was recently discharged from
the [**Hospital1 1501**] and was at home, not on oxygen, with VNA services.
.
On the DOA the VNA came to visit and noted the patient had
gained 4.5 pounds in one day. She was satting 82-84% on RA and
so she was brought to the ED. In the ED her vitals were: T:97.4
HR 74 BP 144/65 RR 20 O2sat 92% on RA and came up to 98% on 2L.
She was given 40mg of IV lasix and diuresed 1Liter. Prior to
transferring to the floor her vitals were: BP 138/61 AR 72 O2
sat 96% on 1.5 L.
 Per her son she has been living in the apartment upstairs from
him and has had VNA a few times per week since being discharged
from the rehab facility recently. Her medications are spread
throughout the apartment and of the ones he could find I have
listed them below. He is not sure that she takes them all every
day or as directed.
.
On presentation to the floor the patient notes that she normally
has shortness of breath while walking and can never sleep flat.
However, over the last week she has had increased shortness of
breath when walking and has had to sit in her arm chair to
sleep. She has also woken up at night very short of breath. She
denies chest pain and says that her legs are actually smaller
than they were a few months ago.

Past Medical History:
-CHF: diastolic dysfunction, EF 55%
-CAD, s/p placement of 2 [**Hospital1 **]: In [**2-7**] found to have 90% lesion
of RCA.  She was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery, and she
was felt to not be a candidate for CABG given her co-morbidities

and morbid obesity. On [**2166-9-3**] she was admitted for SOB and
subsequently had placement of 2 drug eluting stents, one for an
ostial lesion for the
right coronary and one for a distal left circumflex lesion.
-Aortic stenosis (moderate-severe): valve area 0.8cm2 on echo,
1.1cm2 on cath
-Diabetes: controlled on oral meds, last HbA1c=6.1% in [**2-7**].
-s/p ventral hernia repair
-History of cholecystitis
-Hypertension
-Obesity
-Hypercholesterolemia: Controlled on atorvastatin, lipids last
checked [**1-/2166**]: Total cholesterol 161, HDL 45, LDL 93.
-Low back pain s/p motor vehicle accident in [**2159**] with
diffuse degenerative joint disease, pain tolerable without pain
meds
-Hypothyroidism

Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension


Social History:
Was living independently in apartment below son's apartment. Was
at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since stent placement and is currently living at
home with VNA a few times per week.  Walks with a walker, no
problems bathing/dressing.  Denies smoking/ETOH use.  Worked at
[**Hospital1 **] for 26 years as supervisor coordinator.  Son works at [**Hospital1 **] as
materials supervisor, daughter-in-law works as phlebotomist.


Family History:
Father passed away at age 67 from heart attack, mother passed at
82 from heart attack. Has one brother age 65, lives in [**Location **]
[**Country **].  Has two sisters, 83 and 80. No history of cancer in
family.

[**2166-10-16**] CXR (AP): There is stable cardiomegaly. There is
blunting of the costophrenic angles, likely representing small
pleural effusions. There is added density at the right lung base
suggestive of pneumonic consolidation
.
[**2166-10-16**] EKG: Rate 77, Sinus rhythm with atrial premature
depolarizations. Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
.
[**2166-9-3**] CARDIAC CATH:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel CAD. The LMCA had no angiographically flow limiting
lesions. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. The LCX had an 80%
distal stenosis after the takeoff of the OM2. The RCA was a
dominant vessel with an 80% ostial
stenosis with marked pressure dampening with engagement. 2.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 23, an
LVEDP and a PCWP of 36. The cardiac index was preserved at 4.3
L/min/cm2. 3. Moderate aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.9 cm2
and a peak to peak gradient of 60 mmHg.  Left ventriculography
was deferred. 4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA
with a 3.0 x 15 mm XIENCE [**Location (un) **]. Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and TIMI III flow
5. [**Name (NI) 9927**] PTCA and stenting of the distal LCX with a 2.5 x 18
mm [**Name (NI) **]. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the
stent, no dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments)
6. Right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6 French
ANgioseal
device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
4. Successful stenting of the ostial RCA.
5. Successful stenting of the distal LCX.

[**2166-8-19**] ECHO (TTE) :
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area
0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regu
