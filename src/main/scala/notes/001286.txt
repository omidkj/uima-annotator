History of Present Illness:
59 y/o man h/o HIV on HAART (last CD4 868, vL <48 in [**2187-5-16**])
who presented to the ED tonight with increasing shortness of
breath for 1-2 months. He reports that his CPAP machine broke
recently and he therefore has not been using it at home. During
this time, he reports increasing somnolence, also endorsing
dreams and hallucinations during the day. People with whom he
lives have become increasingly concerned in the last several
days and today advised him to come the emergency room for
evaluation. On review of systems, he denies cough or sputum
production. He denies chest pain or pressure, but he does
endorse increasing dyspnea during the last several weeks.
.
Initial vital signs in the ED were T 98.3, HR 109, sat 95% on
4L. Patient reportedly fell asleep while talking to ED
physicians and was noted to snore loudly. An EKG showed sinus
tachycardia with a RBBB that is unchanged from prior. Labs were
remarkable for normal CBC with white count of 9.6 (70% polys).
BMP was also normal (creatinine at baseline 1.4), with normal
LFTs and lipase. His pro-BNP was 169 and troponin was flat. A
d-dimer came back elevated at 915 and so CTA was done that
showed no evidence of PE or other acute process. Urine and serum
toxicology screens were negative. ABG showed 7.35/57/46. Blood
cultures were taken. Patient given Levo, ceftriaxone, Flagyl for
treatment of possible pneumonia. He was a admitted to the ICU
for somnolence and need for positive pressure ventilation.
Vitals at time of admission were sat 99% on 4L, T 99.6, BP
136/73, HR 103.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 y/o man h/o HIV on HAART (well-controlled), morbid obesity,
OSA presents with worsening shortness of breath and somnolence.

.
# Dyspnea/somnolence. Likely secondary to hypercarbia/hypoxemia
from worsening obstructive sleep apnea in the setting of poor
compliance with home CPAP. There was no evidence of pulmonary
infection, CHF or drug intoxication (serum/urine tox negative).
Pt reports severe leak from his BiPAP mask at home and having to
adjust it >6x per night. Pt was placed on home BiPAP and mental
status was much improved by the morning.  Pt is on complex
medication regimen and would benefit from medication
reconciliation and simplification with psychiatry as outpatient.
.
# HIV: continue home HAART regimen.
.
# Bipolar disorder with anxiety and significant depression s/p
ECT in [**2187-1-12**].  Pt was reporting hallucinations on
presentation and was taking Pramiprexole TID.  This was
decreased to qhs only to prevent dopaminergic side effects.
Otherwise, he was continued on his home psych regimen.  We
recommend psych follow up for simplication of his regimen and
changing to meds that are more weight neutral
.
# Hypertension: poorly controlled, increased amlodipine to 10mg
daily
.
# Nephrogenic DI: On day 2 of admission, Na rose to 150 and
corrects easily when patient is alert and has adequate access to
fluids.  Na came down to 146 and pt should be continued on low
sodium and low protein diet in addition to 5L of fluid intake
per day

.
# FEN. Low-sodium diet.
.
# Prophylaxis. Heparin subcutanous, Tylenol prn, bowel regimen.
.
# Access. PIVs.
.
# Communication. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (sister): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111724**].
.
# Code status. DNR but intubation okay.
