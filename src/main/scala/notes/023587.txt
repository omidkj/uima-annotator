dyspepsia/mild nausea for which he took PPI.  He denied any
other associated symptoms at the time.  No dyspnea, chest pain,
neck pain, headache, URI symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal

28  99 oral, 105.6 rectal, 94% RA.  Had episode of hypotension

Chest AP portable:
IMPRESSION:

1. Patchy opacity in left lung base, likely atelectasis. Please
note that
infection is not completely excluded.

2. Clusters of nodular opacities in both lungs, compatible with
patient's
history of chronic mycobacterial avium complex infection.
.
RUQ ultrasound:
FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echogenicity throughout. Small
cysts are noted within the right lobe as seen on prior CT
measuring up to 1.8 cm  There is no intrahepatic biliary
dilatation. Pneumobilia is noted which is also seen on the
previous CT. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The
common bile duct measures up to 9 mm which is within normal
limits given the patient's age and post-cholecystectomy status.
The pancreas is normal in appearance. The main portal vein is
patent with appropriate direction of flow.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction or liver abscess
.
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.9 cm2). An eccentric of mild [1+] aortic regurgitation is
seen, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the mitral
