HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old female,
who presented to her primary care physician's office in the
summer of [**2131**] with complaints of increasing dyspnea and
fatigue.  CT scan done in [**6-/2132**] revealed an 8 cm ascending
aortic aneurysm.  Patient also had pulmonary function tests
done in [**2132-5-18**], which revealed mild restrictive disease
and small airway impairment.  It was determined that the
aortic aneurysm played a significant role in her dyspnea and
she was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for operative treatment
of her aneurysm.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.

rare EtOH use.

PREOPERATIVE PHYSICAL EXAM:  Pulse 84, blood pressure 152/86,
height 5'3", weight 150 pounds.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.
Nonicteric, noninjected.  Neck without bruits or JVD.  Chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally with crackles at bases
bilaterally.  Heart is regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly,
no costovertebral angle tenderness.  Extremities are warm and
well perfused.  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Patient has
bilateral lower extremity varicosities left greater than
right.  Neurologically:  Cranial nerves II through XII are
grossly intact.  Patient is nonfocal with good strength in
all four extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2132-9-11**] for a preoperative
cardiac catheterization prior to operative repair of her
aortic aneurysm.  Cardiac catheterization showed an ejection
fraction of 65% with no coronary artery disease.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was taken to the operating room on [**9-12**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for repair of his ascending aortic aneurysm.
Upon opening the chest in the operating room, patient
developed rapid atrial fibrillation, which is cardioverted
and patient was started on amiodarone.  Patient had total of
129 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass with 95 minutes of
cross clamp and 11 minutes of circulatory arrest.  Please see
operative note for further details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on
stable condition on low dose Epinephrine and amiodarone.  The
Epinephrine was quickly weaned to off.  The patient was
weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on her first
postoperative night.  She remained on amiodarone infusion,
remained in sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day #1, patient's chest tubes were removed.
The patient was mildly hypertensive requiring a nitroglycerin
infusion to maintain systolic blood pressure less than 120.
Patient was restarted on Lopressor and Norvasc.  Patient's
pulmonary artery catheter was removed.  Patient remained in
the Intensive Care Unit through postoperative day #1 into
postoperative day #2 for blood pressure control as patient
remained hypertensive.  Patient's oral medications were
increased and by postoperative day #4, patient had achieved
adequate blood pressure control and patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor.

On the evening of postoperative day #5, the patient developed
rapid atrial fibrillation and required administration of IV
Lopressor and IV amiodarone for rate control.  Patient
converted into sinus rhythm on the morning of postoperative
day #7 and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.  Patient
had also developed mild hyponatremia postoperatively with her
lowest sodium of 125 on postoperative day #3.  Patient was
started on fluid restriction and sodium chloride tablets, and
patient's sodium has been rising with that, and on
postoperative day #8, the patient was cleared for discharge
to rehab.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  T max 98.0, pulse 66 in sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 113/63, respiratory rate 15, and
oxygen saturation on 1 liter is 96%.  Patient is awake,
alert, and oriented times three.  Neurologically nonfocal.
Strength is equal upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
Heart regular, rate, and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Lungs have bibasilar rhonchi with occasional
scattered wheezes.  GI:  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Patient is tolerating a regular diet.
Incision on the chest is very ecchymotic and there is no
erythema and no drainage.  The staples are intact.  Sternum
was stable.  Chest x-ray on [**9-18**] showed significantly
decreased pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.6, hematocrit 32,
platelet count 174.  Sodium 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 95,
bicarb 29, BUN 27, creatinine 0.8, glucose 89.  Patient's
weight on [**9-19**] is 75 kg, which is up 4 kg from patient's
preoperative weight of 71 kg.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. x2 weeks.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q.d. x2 weeks.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Albuterol MDI two puffs q.4h. prn.
7. Albuterol nebulizer treatments q.4h. prn.
8. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Percocet 5/325 1-2 tablets p.o. q.6h. prn.
11. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. x1 month.
12. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Flovent MDI 110 mcg four puffs b.i.d.
14. Sodium chloride 1 gram q.d. until sodium level is greater
than 135.

Patient should also have a 1500 cc fluid restriction until
the hyponatremia has resolved and sodium level continues to
remain stable off the sodium chloride tablet.  Patient will
be discharged to rehab with 1 liter of oxygen via nasal
cannula.  This should be weaned to maintain oxygen saturation
greater than 94%.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Ascending aortic aneurysm.
2. Repair of ascending aortic aneurysm.
3. Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
4. Mild restrictive lung disease.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to rehab
in good condition.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]P INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2545**] in one month.  Patient should follow up with her
