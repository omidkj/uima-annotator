Cardiac Catheterization [**2127-4-5**]:
**preliminary report** revealed R dominant, nomral LV systolic
function. Normal LMCA, minimal LAD, Lcx, and RCA
.
Echocardiogram [**2127-4-5**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR Pa/L [**2127-4-5**]: **preliminary report**
The heart, lungs and mediastinum are within normal limits. No
evidence of focal consolidation, effusion, or CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 50 yo M with a family hx of premature coronary
disease, current tobacco use, presents with chest pain with ECG
showing ST elevations, found to have minimal coronary disease on
cardiac cath
.
1) Chest pain: C.Cath revealead minimal disease in LAD, LCX,
RCA. No significant CAD to suggest coronaries as a culprit.
Etiology was felt to be likely pericarditis vs Asthma
exacerbation.  TTE with minimal LVH, normal valves and EF, and
physiologic pericardial effusion.  Pa/L CXR was negative for
pneumonia.  The patient was given ibuprofen and nebs for asthma.
 He was counseled to quit smoking and expressed a plan to stop.
He will follow up with his primary care physician.
.
2) RHTYHM- NSR. no acute issues

essentially normal.
.
4) Asthma:  Pt with a history of Asthma but has not seen a
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 5 years.  O2 saturation was initially 87% on room
air, but inproved to 94% on room air after several albuterol and
ipratropium nebulizer treatments.  Peak flow was 225 initially
but improved to 350 by the time of discharge.  He was started on
a short course of steroids, 40mg prednisone x 5 days.  He will
be discharged with a prescription for albuterol inhaler, and
follow up with his primary care physician.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was strongly
encouraged to quit smoking.
.
5) FEN- cardiac diet.  He received fluids post catheterization.
.
6) PPX: Pneumoboots and then ambulation.  Bowel regimen. Po
intake.

You were admitted with chest pain which is NOT felt to be due to
a blockage in your heart.  Your cardiac catheterization revealed
minimal disease in your coronary arteries.  The pain you were
feeling is most likely due to an Asthma exacerbation or some
mild inflammation in the lining around your heart.
