Chief Complaint:
s/p fall vs ?syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-8-10**] Cardiac cath
[**2187-8-23**]
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease
valve.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x3, with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery,
reversed saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the
second obtuse marginal coronary artery, and reversed saphenous
vein single graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary

History of Present Illness:
79 year old female who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
for definitive treatment of her AFib. She was admitted to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**8-5**] after a fall (? syncope vs.
mechanical, patient not a good historian). She was ruled out for
an MI but she was found to be in AFib with RVR. She endorses
lower extremity edema. Reportedly her AFib has been very hard to
control because she becomes hypotensive with higher doses of
rate controlling medications. She was in rapid atrial
fibrillation with HR 100-110 at rest and 150 with movement. TTE
showed EF 30-35% with AS (valve area 1.33 cm2). She is unsure if
she carries a diagnosis of CHF though she is on lasix as an
outpatient. Also, she reports that she had an infection in both
of her legs for which she was on Keflex for an unknown period of
time. She was found to have three vessel coronary artery disease
and aortic stenosis upon cardiac catheteriation today and is now
being referred to cardiac surgery for an aortic valve
replacement and revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2187-8-10**] Cath:  1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA had a 25% lesion at the origin. The distal
LMCA was calcified with plaquing of uncertain severity leading
into ostial LAD and LCx lesions. The LAD was heavily calcified
with a mild ostial plaque. There was a mild stenosis of the
origin of the large D1 with a proximal D1 lesion of 40% and a
mid D1 lesion of 40% as well after the bifurcation. The mid-LAD
had a 40% lesion while the distal LAD had an 80% stenosis. The
LCx was also heavily calcified with an ostial stenosis of 75%.
There was a small OM1, tiny OM2, and a tortuous OM3 with a
proximal 40% stenosis. The LPL1 and LPL2 were of modest caliber.
The RCA was moderately calcified. A 60% ostial stenosis remained
after giving IC TNG (making vasospasm unlikely) that involved
the origin of the large conus and AM/RV branch. Prominent atrial
branches were noted. The RPDA had a 75% proximal stenosis.  2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed preserved systemic arterial
pressure (with a central aortic pressure of 118/66, mean 88
mmHg) with marked mixed venous hypoxemia and marked elevation of
PCW (28 mmHg) consistent with profoundly reduced cardiac output
(CI 1.4 L/min/m2, suggestive of cardiogenic shock) using a
measured VO2 (253 mL/min). Low cardiac output, low gradient
severe aortic stenosis also found ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.6-0.7 cm2 with mean
gradient 20-23 mmHg). Dobutamine was not given in the setting of
atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of ~100 bpm and recent
history of rapid ventricular rate.  3. Left ventriculography was
not performed. The aortic knob, aortic
valve, and aortic sinuses were calcified. 4. Given low normal
systemic arterial pressures of 100-110 mm Hg, adenosine was not
administered for pressure wire evaluation of the LMCA into the
LAD. 5. Of note, the ABG oxygen saturation was much lower than
the oxygen saturation measured on the same specimen in the
cardiac catheterization laboratory using the AVOX machine (82%
vs. 93% and 91%). Analysis of a subsequent specimen showed a
good match between the AVOX and ABG oxygen saturations,
suggesting loss of O2 from an inadequately sealed specimen sent
down for the initial ABG.

[**2187-8-12**] Chest CT: 1. Asymmetric enlargement of the thyroid gland
with an enlarged right thyroid lobe. Possible nodules present.
Thyroid ultrasound is recommended. 2. Enlarged mediastinal lymph
nodes with a 26 mm right upper paratracheal lymph node (suggest
consideration of bronchoscopic biopsy if biopsy of this node is
desired). 3. 2 mm pulmonary nodule within the left upper lobe
(4:59). If there are no risk factors for lung carcinoma, further
followup is not required. If the patient is high risk for lung
carcinoma, followup CT at 1 year is recommended. If there is a
known malignancy then suggest follow up CT in 3 months. 4. Small
bilateral pleural effusions. 5. Diffuse cardiac enlargement. 6.
Mild-to-moderate aortic calcification. 7. Stable enlargement of
the left adrenal gland since [**2183-8-25**].

[**2187-8-13**] Carotid U/S: 1. No evidence of significant carotid
artery stenosis bilaterally. 2. Calcified atherosclerotic
plaques bilaterally, left more than right.

[**2187-8-17**] Head CT: No evidence of acute intracranial
abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL COURSE:

79 y/o female admitted on [**8-5**] to [**Hospital1 1474**] following a fall
found to be in A fib with RVR and low normal pressures, admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care of AFib, found to have
significantly decreased EF, 3-vessel CAD and severe AS.

Diagnoses:

# Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Apparently just diagnosed
at the outside hospital that she was transferred from. BNP of
2,134.  EF on repeat Echo here significantly decreased EF at
20-25%.  She was also clinically in CHF with peripheral edema,
crackles on lung exam, overloaded CXR and DOE.  During her stay
she was gently diuresed but diuresis was difficult at times
because occasionally her pressures drop and/or her Cr would bump
up a bit.  For this reason she was gent
