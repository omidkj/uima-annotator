Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
admitted [**5-19**] for renal failure MELD 39, received liver
transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis
liver transplant


History of Present Illness:
HPI from admission to transplant surgery [**6-12**]:
39 yo woman w cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomaisis, MELD 39
awaiting liver transplant admitted [**5-19**] for acute renal failure
and transferred to MICU today for declining mental status and
bradycardia, pre-op for OLTx in the morning.

Her hospital course has been notable for a rising creatinine,
hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, low TSH and total T4 levels,
and blood transfusions as well as infusions of albumin.

Since transfer to the MICU earlier today she has been stable
from
a cardiopulmonary standpoint.  From a mental status standpoint,
she continues to be responsive to physical stimuli but not to
voice.

Original HPI from admission [**5-19**]:
39 y/o woman with ESLD s/s shistosomiasis on transplant list who
is presenting from home with inability to urinate. Per reports,
she was seen in clinic friday and was doing reasonably well.
Over the weekend, however, she developed shortness of breath,
worsening pruritis, and inability to urinate. She reports she
did not make urine for 14 hours. She denies fevers, chills,
nausea, or vomitting. She also notes frequent hicups.
.
On arrival to the emergency department, her blood pressure was
90/43, HR 72 Rr 18, sating 100%RA. She had a foley catheter
placed which immedietly drained 500cc of dark urine. She did not
have a bladder pressure transduced in the ED and the medical
floors do not transduce bladder pressures. She did not get IV
fluids in the emrgency department. Urine studies were not sent.
.
She had labs drawn which showed cr 1.2 and she was admitted. Of
note, she was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 46783**] for acute renal
failure and had her spironolactone and lasix held on discharge.
She has not re-started them. Her creatinine on discharge [**5-11**]
was 0.6 and when checked in clinic [**5-17**] was also 0.6.


Past Medical History:
1)ESLD from schistosomiasis; currently on the transplant list.
She is s/p single treatment with Praziquantel and no evidence of
organisms on ERCP evaluations; she has known about her liver
disease for about 8-10 years. She also had episodes of jaundice
and pruritis 10 to 15 years ago in [**Country 4194**], both times when she
was pregnant. Once in her sixth month of pregnancy and once in
her eight month of pregnancy. She was told that she had
hepatitis C. She has hepatitis C antibody, but negative PCR. She
lost her baby both times. Her jaundice and pruritis resolved
after delivery, both episodes. She is immune to hepatitis A. She
is vaccinated for hepatitis B. No prior history of culture
positive SBP, but has received empiric treatment in the past.
2)Grade [**12-21**] varicies and portal gastropathy without bleeding on
endoscopy in [**12-28**]
3)HCV+ but PCR repeatedly negative
4)s/p CCY 15y ago in [**Country 4194**] for which she received blood txf
5)s/p tubal ligation
6)GERD, previously admitted for associated epigastric pain
7)Strongyloides Ab positive in [**12-28**] - treated w/5 days
Ivermectin
8) SBP on cefpodoxime ppx
.

Social History:

CXR [**6-4**]
Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion have worsened
consistent with a greater volume overload, but there is no
pulmonary edema, and no findings in the lungs to suggest
pneumonia. Mild cardiomegaly is longstanding. Feeding tube
passes into the stomach and out of view. Pleural effusion, if
any, is minimal. No pneumothorax.

[**5-19**] Renal U/s 1. Mild fullness in the left kidney, compared to
right kidney, but no hydronephrosis bilaterally. 2. Ascites.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-4**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a nasal duodenal
feeding tube that terminates in the third portion of the
duodenum. The shrunken cirrhotic appearance of the liver with
splenomegaly and extensive splenorenal shunts as well as
retroperitoneal collaterals is similar to before. Two exophytic
masses are again noted in the liver, corresponding to known foci
of hepatocellular carcinoma. Each is similar in size and
density; the lower one in segment VI is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**], but
the appearance is unchanged. There is no evidence that either
one of them has hemorrhaged. Massive low-density ascites is
present without areas of high densities to suggest hemorrhage.
There is moderately more ascites than on the prior CT.
Comparison with
interval ultrasound is difficult to judge for small changes
because of the
differences in modality. Within the limitations of a
non-contrast study, the pancreas, and kidneys are unremarkable.
The right adrenal gland appears normal. The left is difficult to
visualize because of extensive superimposed collateral vessels.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder, uterus, sigmoid,
and rectum are unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION: Massive low-density ascites with no evidence of
intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Similar appearance of cirrhosis with
two masses known thought to represent hepatocellular carcinoma
and evidence for portal hypertension


Brief Hospital Course:
39 y/o woman with end stage liver disease [**1-21**] schistosomiasis
admitted with urinary retention and acute renal failure.

Urinary Retention and Acute Renal Failure; had 500cc dark urine
drained upon placement of foley on admission. Fena was
consistent pre-renal etiology, but Cr clearly improved with
catheterization. Unclear if this represents retention from
medication effect, obstruction, or abdominal pressure or if
there is a component of relative volume [**Name2 (NI) 54946**] as well.
Suspect volume depletion +/- medication effect on bladder
function. Cr continued to fluctuate widely while in house, and
patient required several doses of albumin. For this reason, she
could not be continued on diureitcs to help reduse her ascites
burden. She was continued on octreotide and midodrine for
presumed HRS. Renal failure was complicated by hypercalcemia and
hyperphosphatemia. An endo
