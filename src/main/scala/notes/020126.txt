IMAGING:
-CT HEAD ([**2177-10-30**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Right EVD drain has been
removed with tiny focus of hemorrhage and edema surrounding the
tract. 2. Stable size of ventricles.  No progression of
hydrocephalus.
-CT HEAD ([**2177-11-4**]): CONCLUSION: 1. Mild partial interval
improvement in the dilatation of the lateral and third
ventricular size compared to the prior study.  Unchanged size of
the fourth ventricle. 2. No acute hemorrhage.
-CXR (PORTABLE AP) ([**2177-11-7**]): Comparison is made with prior
study, [**11-5**]. Extensive bilateral lung opacities, worse
on the right lung, are unchanged consistent with multifocal
aspiration pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions, Larger on
the right side, are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in
positioning of the patient.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
stable. Right PICC tube tip is in the lower SVC.
-VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW ([**2177-11-11**]): IMPRESSION: Penetration

-CT HEAD ([**2177-11-12**]): CONCLUSION: Prominent but stable appearance
of the ventricles compared to most recent CT without evidence of
new hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is a 55 year old male with a history of hypertension
who was treated for a subarachnoid hemorrhage with coiling of a
right PICA aneurysm and placement of an external ventricular
drain. He developed a Staph epidermidis infection of the drain,
for which he was treated with IV vancomycin and removal of the
drain. He had a precipitous drop in hematocrit due to a bleeding
duodenal ulcer that was treated with an ulcer clipping, blood
transfusions, pantoprazole, and sucralfate. Due to hypotension,
initiation of lisinopril, and supra-therapeutic levels of
vancomycin, he developed acute kidney injury/acute tubular
necrosis, which improved over the course of his stay. He then
developed hypoxemia, from a combination of fluid overload in the
setting of acute kidney injury and pneumonia. He was treated
with careful fluid management and vancomycin and cefepime with
resolution in his hypoxemia. His course was notable for a waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] level of consciousness, related to injury sustained
during his subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was discharged to a
skilled nursing facility for further rehabilitation.

# Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Head CT imaging revealed a diffuse,
extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage along with hydrocephalus.
Further imaging revealed a right posterior inferior cerebellar
artery aneurysm, that was treated with coiling. An external
ventricular drain was placed to decreased intraventricular
pressure. Repeat head CT imaging after drain removal did not
reveal progression of his hydrocephalus or significant continued
bleeding. While hospitalized, the patient's mental status waxed
and waned, with periods of increased alertness and orientation
and periods of somnolence, related to injuries sustained from
his subarachnoid hemorrhage. [**Hospital 92114**] medical complications
detailed below also contributed to his wavering mental status.

# Pneumonia: After the patient developed low grade fevers and
new hypoxemia, chest x-ray revealed right lung opacities
consistent with an aspiration pneumonia. The patient was treated
with vancomycin and cefepime for 8 days out of concern for a
hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient was afebrile after
treatment and was weaned off of supplemental oxygen.

# Acute kidney injury with acute tubular necrosis: This was due
to hypotension, lisinopril, and supra-therapeutic levels of
vancomycin. The patient was treated with careful fluid
management, including Lasix diuresis, and discontinuation of
lisinopril and additional vancomycin. His creatinine peaked at
4.5 (baseline 0.5), before trending downwards to 2.8 at
discharge. Creatinine and electrolytes should be checked every 7
days to ensure continued improvment.

# Drug rash: The patient developed a macular, erythematous rash
on his trunk and bilateral lower extremities from cefepime while
hospitalized. There was no evidence of mucosal involvment, no
lesions on the palms or soles. He was treated with Sarna lotion
and Benadryl. The rash remained on the day of dishcarge.

# Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient experienced an ac
