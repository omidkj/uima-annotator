History of Present Illness:
45 yo male with h/o UGIB, pancreatitis, HTN, DM2, HTN,
schizophrenia transferred from [**Hospital 189**] Hospital for UGIB thought
to have splenic artery aneurysm.  Patient had been admitted
there, full records are not available for review.  An EGD
performed at the OSH showed a peptic ulcer.  He was discharged
for outpatient [**Hospital **] eval, and within 2 hours of dischage,
had massive hematemesis again and re-presented to ED at outside
hospital.  He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for GI and
[**Hospital1 **] evaluations.  He was hemodynamically stable per report,
was given 3 units of pRBC and 5L IVF prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals wer 97.8, 128/86, 84, 16, 100% RA.  He
had an NGT which showed bright red blood and 250 cc lavage was
done.  The patient was given zofran for nausea.  He was also
given 1 unit of pRBC and FFP prior to transfer to MICU. Vitals
prior to transfer were 84 126/53 18 100% RA

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2103-8-4**] 1:10 PM:
1. 7 x 3 cm hematoma along the posterior wall of the stomach. No
definite
extravasation of IV contrast to suggest active hemorrhage.
2. A few small locules of gas posterior to the hematoma
concerning for
contained retroperitoneal perforation.
3. Thrombosis of the splenic vein with numerous collateral
vessels in the left upper abdomen.
.
[**2103-8-8**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2103-8-10**] Pathology:
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: immunophenotyping - spleen
DIAGNOSIS:
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda,
and CD antigens 19, 45.
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.
The sample viability done by 7-AAD exclusion is 88%.
A limited panel is performed to determine B-cell clonality.
CD45-bright, low side-scatter 'lymphoid' gated cells are 3% of
total analyzed events.
B cells comprise 25% of lymphoid gated events (less than 1% of
total) and are polyclonal.
INTERPRETATION
Diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen, on a limited
panel. Correlation with clinical findings and morphology (see
separate report) is recommended. Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Note: This test was performed using analyte specific reagents
(ASRs).  These ASRs have not been cleared or approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  However, the FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.
This test was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by the Flow Cytometry Laboratory at [**Hospital1 771**], which is licensed by CLIA to perform
high complexity tests.  This test was used for clinical
purposes; it should not be regarded as for research.

[**2103-8-10**] Pathology:
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: SPLEEN, ABDOMINAL WALL TISSUE.
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Spleen, splenectomy:
Spleen (484 g) with expansion of the red pulp.
Note: Sections reveal a normal white pulp architecture with
small lymphocytes without expansion or follicular hyperplasia.
The red pulp is expanded with vascular congestion.  No abnormal
infiltrate is identified.  Flow cytometry showed polyclonal
B-cells.  An area of subcapsular fibrous plaque is noted.
2.  Abdominal wall tissue:
Dense fibrous tissue, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Clinical: GI bleed.
Gross:
The specimen is received fresh in two parts, each labeled with
the patient's name, "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]" and the medical record number.
Part 1 is additionally labeled "spleen". It consists of a spleen
that weighs 484 grams and measures 15 x 11 x 4.0 cm. On one
surface there is an 11 x 6 cm dense fibrous plaque. It arrived
previously sliced down the middle. The specimen is serially
sliced to reveal unremarkable deep red cut surfaces. Due to the
remarkable size of the specimen, a lymphoma workup is performed.
The specimen is represented as follows: A = section of spleen
with fibrous rind, B-E=random sections of spleen. G= Hilum
Part 2 is additionally labeled "abdominal wall tissue". It
consists of a 2.7 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm piece of firm fibrofatty
tissue. The specimen is represented in cassette F.

[**2103-8-14**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON:
1. Study is limited by technical factors, as above. Acute
pulmonary emboli
involving the right upper and right lower lobe lobar arteries
extending
partially into the segmental branches as described above.
2. Pathologic mediastinal adenopathy of uncertain etiology. A 3
month chest CT is recommended for follow up.
3. Evidence of anasarca and volume overload including new
bilateral small
pleural effusions.
4. Tracheal secretions within the right main stem bronchus.
5. Evidence of recent surgery including splenectomy and free
intraabdominal air and fluid.
6. Moderate c
