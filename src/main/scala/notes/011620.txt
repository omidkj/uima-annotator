CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year old
female with a history of asthma and bronchitis.  She has had
two intubations in the past.  She is a current smoker.  She
is diabetic.  She presents with four days of productive cough
with sputum, fevers and chills which were subjective as she
never took her own temperature, and shortness of breath.  She
is chronically on home oxygen two liters nasal cannula.  She
denies sick contacts or travels.  She reports myalgias, sore
throat and rhinorrhea.  She denies chest pain, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting or dysuria.
She denies flu vaccine, but it is documented in the OMR.

The patient at home takes Albuterol metered dose inhaler
every four hours or six times a day as needed.  She did not
monitor her peak flows at home.

In the Emergency Department, the patient received Combivent
nebs times two, Zithromax 100 p.o. q day, 125 mg of Solu-
Medrol intravenously times one and 6 units of Regular
subcutaneous insulin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma.

Chronic bronchitis.

Diabetes mellitus type 2; not on any medications.

Hypertension.

Bipolar disease.

PFO.

Her echocardiogram in [**2196-2-27**] showed an ejection
fraction of 30 to 35 percent, moderate global hypokinesis,
one plus mitral regurgitation and impaired relaxation.

The patient has a history of being noncompliant with her
medications per the medical record.

MEDICATIONS:  The medications that the patient is supposed to
be taking are:
1. Diltiazem XR 180 mg q day.
2. Risperidone 4 mg twice a day.
3. Depakote 250 mg twice a day.
4. Benztropine 0.5 mg twice a day.
5. Albuterol inhaler.


FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At presentation, her vital signs were
148/80; heart rate 96; respiratory rate 23; 94 percent on
four liters nasal cannula; temperature was 99.3 F.; with a
peak flow of 275 and a finger stick of 233.  She was not in
acute distress.  She had dry mucous membranes.  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
muscles intact.  Clear oropharynx.  No lymphadenopathy, no
jugular venous distention.  Chest with expiratory wheezes in
the upper lung fields.  Decreased breath sounds in the lower
lung fields.  There was no dullness to percussion and no
crackles.  She was a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Her abdomen was positive bowel sounds,
nondistended, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  She had no
edema.  She had two plus dorsalis pedis pulses.  Her
neurological examination was nonfocal.  She was generally
disheveled, speaking in full sentences, poor insight.  Guaiac
negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  When she presented, white blood cell count
16, hematocrit 48.5, platelets 386.  MCV 97.  Chem-7 with
sodium 152, potassium 5.2, chloride 104, bicarbonate 33, BUN
28, creatinine 1.6, her baseline is about 1.2.  Her glucose
was 306 on her Chem-7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On day one, night one of her hospital
admission, the patient began to feel restless and developed
sinus tachycardia to the 160s.  Her O2 saturations dropped to
87 percent on nasal cannula.  The patient was given 2 mg of
intravenous Ativan; this was while she was in the Emergency
Department.  She had increased requirement for breathing and
increased lethargy.  She was placed on 100 percent non
rebreather with some increase in her alertness.  Her first
ABG was 7.23, 82, 75.  A repeat ABG two hours later showed
worsening respiratory acidosis at 7.14, 170, 232.  She was
intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient
was placed on a propofol drip which was stopped transiently
for hypotension.  She was eventually placed on the AC mode
and transferred to the SICU.  The patient was extubated on
[**2197-3-3**].

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient was
placed on a prednisone taper for two weeks.  She received
Atrovent nebs and Combivent MDI.

PNEUMONIA:  She had a right middle lobe and left lower lobe
infiltrate, an elevated white count and sputum with Gram
positive cocci in pairs with oral flora.  The patient had a
penicillin allergy so she was treated with Levaquin.  Gram
positive cocci were felt to be an oral colonization.  The
patient defervesced, her oxygenation improved and her
secretions decreased as well.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 30 percent and diastolic dysfunction.  She had
pulmonary edema during her intubation in the setting of sinus
tachycardia.  It was unclear what the etiology of the sinus
tachycardia was in the Emergency Department.  The patient was
continued on diltiazem for blood pressure and rate control,
and the patient will require a full workup for cardiomyopathy
as outpatient potentially looking for toxic substances like
alcohol or cocaine, this possibly being the potential
etiology.

The patient had non-symptomatic nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia in the Unit.  She has a low ejection fraction but
she has a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  She was deemed not a
candidate for defibrillator at that time and had a negative
stress a year prior to this admission.

RENAL:  Initial BUN and creatinine were elevated in the
setting of volume depletion and improved with hydration.  She
also at that time had hypernatremia that also improved with
hydration during her course in the SICU.  On [**3-3**], the
patient had an increased BUN and she was hypernatremic and
hyperkalemic.  All of that was on the day that an ACE was
started without EKG changes when her ACE inhibitor was
stopped and she received D5W for hypernatremia to correct her
free water deficit.  She improved all of her electrolyte
abnormalities.

ENDOCRINE - DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  She was on an insulin
sliding scale and she had finger sticks four times a day.

PROPHYLAXIS:  She was on lansoprazole and subcutaneous
heparin.

ALLERGIES:  It is notable that the patient has allergies to
penicillin, ampicillin, Bactrim, Motrin and Lithium.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Congestive heart failure.

Hypertension.

Hypercarbic respiratory failure status post intubation and
extubation.

Diabetes mellitus type 2.
