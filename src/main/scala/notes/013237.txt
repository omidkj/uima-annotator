Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial Window
[**2-9**] - Splenectomy

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o with hx of HTN, anxiety, several herniated discs,
polyarthralgia on prednisone who was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] for
recent pna/sepsis with + blood for strep pneumo and is now
transferred from [**Hospital1 39933**] ICU for further management of PE and
pericardial effusion. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2120-1-20**] for pneumonia. She states that she had a head cold
during the week of admission, she then developed severe chest
pain "sharp/pressure like" on mid substernal and left side of
chest. This was accompanied by nausea/vomiting and diaphoresis.
It lasted ~ 2 hours before she called 911. At [**Hospital3 4107**],
she had CT of chest W/o contrast that showed right upper lobe
consolidation as per CT report and no pleural effusion. she was
diagnosed with pna and sepsis from strep pneumo. Uncertain if
workup was done to r/o MI. As per family, she was in the ICU for
3 days, but was never intubated. She was treated with
ceftriaxone IV and Azitro for total of 7 days. She was discharge
home on [**2120-1-26**] on Ceftin 500mg [**Hospital1 **]. As per family she
developed LE edema R>L while hospitalized. This was thought to
be due to fluid overload and she was given lasix. Since her
discharge she had SOB with min exertion. She denies having any
chest pain or discomfort. Her SOB seem worse yesterday and she
became febrile up to 101 and went back to [**Hospital3 4107**]. She
had a repeat CTA today that showed bibasilar atelectasis,
mod-to-large pericardial effusion (new), bilateral pleural
effusions, RUL PE. She was evaluated by cardiologists. A TTE was
done and that was no tamponade. She was started on heparin drip
for her PE and given concern for bleeding, she was tranfer here
for further evaluation. As per report her SBP of 132 and she had
no pulses, HR in 105-111 on time of transfer. She also had LENIs
prior to transfer that were negative for DVT.
.
Of note, pt has been taking prednisone 10mg PO Qday for
polyarthritic pain. She states that the prednisone was not
helping and she stopped ~ 1 week ago.
.
She arrived in the MICU , except for increase in RR in the low
30s. Her HR is sinus tachy in low 110s-130s, with SBPs in 150s.
Initial pulsus measured at 12. Sating 95-97% on 2L NC.  Bedside
echo was performed, which showed RV diastolic collapse and an
echdense effusion.  At this time, it was determined that she
would be drained in the morning, as she was maintaining good
pressures at the time.  She was [**Hospital 71236**] transferred to the
CCU for further management.
.
On review of systems, she states she did have a fever to 101 at
home prior to presentation to [**Hospital3 4107**]. She denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for stable ankle edema and
mid-shin ankle erythema.  Notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]:
VS: T= 100.8 BP= 170/61 HR= 109 RR= 34 O2 sat=  95% 2L
GENERAL: Anxious, mild respiratory distress.
HEENT: Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral
mucosa. No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 12 cm.
CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular
line. Irreg Irreg, no m/r/g.
LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: + erythema on kid shin bilaterally
PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+


Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2120-2-4**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a moderate to
large sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There is right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
ECHO [**2120-2-5**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small
(1cm) basal inferolateral pericardial effusion without evidence
of tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2120-2-3**], the pericardial effusion is smaller and tamponade
physiology is no longer suggested.
.
[**2120-2-8**]
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2120-2-5**], no major change.
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2120-2-4**]
COMMENTS:
1. Unsuccessful pericardiocentesis related to probable marked
fibrinous
disease
2. Will likely require surgical drainage: plan to follow any
progression
of tamponade
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Unsuccessful pericardiocentesis related to probable marked
fibrinoid
disease
2. Will likely require surgical drainage: plan to follow for
evidence of
any progression of tamponade
.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**2120-2-4**]
IMPRESSION: No DVT bilaterally in the bilateral lower
extremities.
.
CT Chest without Contrast [**2120-2-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval insertion of a right pleural drain and a pericardial
drain with consequent decrease in the size of the right pleural
and pericardial
effusions.
2. New ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe most
likely reflect
re-expansion pulmonary edema; however, in the appropriate
clinical setting, infection may have a similar appearance.
3. The left pleural effusion has increased slightly in size with
more
associated worsening adjacent atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o F with a history of hypertension, recent pneumonia, now
with PE, new pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology on
echo, failed drain, now s/p pericardial window, and pigtail
drain placed to R-sided pleural effusion, who was transferred to
the surgical service from medicine for acute exploratory
laparotomy in the setting of acute intra-abdominal bleed.
