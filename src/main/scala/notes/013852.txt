Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
RUQ US:
IMPRESSION:

Dilated extrahepatic common bile duct to 1.4 cm near the hilum.
Distal
evaluation including evaluation of the pancreatic head could not
be performed given overlying bowel gas. Recommend CT for further
evaluation to exclude underlying mass lesion or obstructing
stone.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Choledocholithiasis causing biliary obstruction. ERCP is
recommended.

2. Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.

3. Large diaphragmatic hernia containing stomach, transverse
colon and tail of the pancreas.

4. Multiple bladder diverticula.
.
.
ERCP:
Impression: Food mixed with liquid was found in the stomach
Tortuous stomach was noted
A single periampullary diverticulum was identified
The major papilla was normal
Successful deep cannulation of the common bile duct using a
sphincterotome was performed
Contrast medium was injected into the common bile duct resulting
in complete opacification
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and right and left
hepatic ducts were filled with contrast and well visualized
A 2 cm round-shaped stone was noted in the mid-common bile duct
causing complete biliary obstruction
Moderate biliary dilation was noted in the common bile duct
proximal to the stone, as well as in the common hepatic ducts,
and right and left hepatic ducts
Successful placement of a 10Fr 9cm Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent
because of severe cholangitis was performed because of severe
cholangitis. Adequate bile flow into the duodenum was noted
following biliary stent placement.
.
Recommendations: Fluids when alert and awake
Follow up for response and complications
Continue IV antibiotics and supportive care
Follow up ERCP in 8 weeks for repeat ERCP, sphincterotomy,
lithotripsy and CBD stone extraction
Follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo M without significant pmh who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
from OSH for cholangitis w/o cholecystitis. He was admitted to
the ICU and he had an ERCP done on [**1-16**] with removal of 2cm
stone from the mid-common bile duct which had been causing
complete biliary obstruction and was stented. He was initially
on Vanc/Zosyn/Levo which was changed after ERCP to Levo/Flagyl.

.
# Cholangitis:
Pt underwent ERCP with 2 cm stone removal from CBD, and patient
was treated with antibiotics which were converted to
Levofloxacin and flagyl. LFT's continued to trend down, patient
remained afebrile, WBC trended down.
- cont Levo/Flagyl for a 10 day course, day 1 was [**1-16**])
- follow up ERCP in 8 weeks for sphincterotomy, lithotripsy, and
CBD stone extraction
- Follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
.
# Coagulopathy:
Patient was noted to have a coagulopathy with a peak INR of 1.5,
likely d/t nutritional depletion/biliary obstruction.
- rec'd 1 dose of 5mg Vit K IV [**1-17**]
- coags improved to INR 1.2
.
# Anemia: Patient??????s Hct decreased from 36 to 32.5. Was > 4 L
positive on admission, so likely dilutional. H/H monitored, and
remained stable.
.
# Pulmonary infiltrates/COPD: The pulmonary infiltrates on CXR
were thought to be due to PNA vs. capillary leak in the setting
of sepsis. No symptoms/signs of resp distress/hypoxia.
Legionella urinary Ag negative.
- Pt being treated with antibiotics for cholangitis anyway which
would be adequate treatment for pneumonia.  Pt remained
afebrile.
- cont nebs
.
# dementia
Pt was noted to have memory defecits, depression, and anxiety.
Geriatrics was consulted, and further lab workup revealed TSH
11. Unclear if this represented euthyroid sic vs true
hypothyroidism. Due to pt's depressive symptoms, and general
poor sense of well being prior to acute illness, it seems
reasonable to start Synthroid and have pt follow up with PCP for
[**Name9 (PRE) 21033**]'s with titration as appropriate.
- B12/folate WNL
- Synthroid 75 mcg po q day; f/u with PCP
.
# Depression
Pt noted to be depressed; geriatrics consulted.  TSH elevated as
above.
- contin Citalopram
- contin Quetiapine hs
