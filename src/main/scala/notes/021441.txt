chest pain, SOB and treated for CHF exacerbation. Of note, at
that time, he was found to be in a.fib and later started on
coumadin as an outpatient. He states that for the last 2 months
he has had nonradiating epigastric abdominal pain which he
cannot describe in further detail however, he admits that it is
worse post prandially and he has had decreased PO intake because
of it. He came to the ED for evaluation because he began to
worry when it got worse.
.
In the ED, Mr. [**Known lastname 26010**] was found to be afebrile but hypotensive
to 88/68 with increased LFTs. Morphine, 500 mg levofloxacin, 500
mg flagyl, 1 gm vanco, 4 units FFP, were administed and the
patient was admitted to the SICU. GI was consulted for ? ERCP
and hep serologies were sent. Levo/Flag were continued. RUQ u/s
showed some GB edema but not convincing for cholecystits or
cholangitis; CT abd/pelv w/o IV contrast shows atherosclerosis,
unable to eval biliary tree. He was then transfered to the MICU
for further evaluation and management. This morning he complains
of thirst, says abdominal pain gone and wants to eat.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially admitted to the surgery service.  There is
no dictated summary of the events that transpired while he was
on that service from [**1-4**] - [**1-5**].  He was then transferred to
the MICU.  No MICU course was dictated or entered by the MICU
housestaff.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on the afternoon on
[**1-7**] to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2418**] and then transferred again the following
morning ([**1-8**]) to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  He was then discharged home
later that same day.  All of the following hospital course is
per record review:
.
#ABD pain: Patient was admitted with chief complaint of abd pain
and elevated LFT's.  Ddx included acute hepatitis,stones (u/s
negative), ascending choleangitis (blood cx negtaive, no fever),
ischemia.  LFT's not consitent with EToH or NASH.  Iron studies
not c/w hemasiderosis.  Also consider drugs vs autoimmune.
Zetia and hydral were held.  Blood cultures were negative.
Hepatitis panel negative.  Hepatology was consulted.  Liver
enzymes were trended and it was noted that the LFT's began to
improve dramatically on HD2, which was consistent with an
ischemic insult to the liver.  Eventually the elevated LFT's
were attributed to shock liver [**3-4**] hypoperfusion, possibly due
to a silent NSTEMI.  Patient improved clinically and was
discharged with close follow-up with his cardiologist who is
also his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

# leukocytosis: Unknown source. Patient covered empiracally for
48 hours with Vanco, flagyl, levo util blood cultures were
negative.  Trended down and had normalized by day of discharge.
.
# ARF: unknown etiology but likely prerenal as patient complains
of thirst and has decreased PO intake.  Patient has had a recent
renal u/s without hydro and it was not noted on CT abdomen so
likely not post renal obstruction. This could be his new
baseline as his Cr was 2 during his last admit in [**Month (only) **].
Creatinine did improve slightly with gentle IV hydration.
.
#CHF: EF of 30%. stable.
.
# Rhythm: Hx of a fib.  Anticoagulation was reversed with FFP
and vit k.
.
# arteries: has history of stents, most recent in [**Month (only) 956**]. EKG
unchanged. Trop up, consistent with ARF. Baseline 0.1.  EKG w/
ST elevations in inferior leads and depressions in anterior
leads, unchanged or improved from prior.
.
# anemia: normocytic baseline HCT 28. Iron level was 41, TIBC
248, ferritin 383, consistent with iron deficiency in [**Month (only) 321**].

.
# depression: continued paroxetine
.
# prophylaxis: hep SQ, PPI
.
# FEN: cardiac, low salt diet
.
