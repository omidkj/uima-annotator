Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4583**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral leg weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture
IVC filter placement
Open right frontal brain biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 year-old right-handed man with past medical
history of back injury 36years ago, coronary artery disease
status post CABG four years ago who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**2104-11-1**] with bilateral leg weakness and backache, with onset ten
days prior to admission and worsening over the three days
leading up to admission. He was in his usual state of health
until ten days prior to admission, when patient twisted his
lower back when he was standing in the bus, when it turned. He
noticed sharp shooting pain thru his legs bilaterally. Paint was
transient at that time and was followed by numbness. The
symptoms got worse three days prior to admission with bilateral
leg numbness, pain, weakness, and difficulty with ambulation.
Patient stayed in the bed. Noted difficulty with urination two
days prior to admission and no bowel movement for three days.

Patient has had chronic backaches and occasional/transient
numbness at legs for past 36 years since he injured his lower
back by slipping and falling when he carried bananas back in
[**Country 3594**]. Approximately twenty years ago, patient was diagnosed
with "spine compression" while in [**Country 3594**]. He was later
followed at [**Hospital1 112**] since about 10 years ago for his back pain and
occasional numbness.

On review of systems, reports no fever, headache, neckache,
diarrhea, vomiting, recent travel, tick bites, other traumatic
episodes.

-----
Lumbar puncture with 32 wbc with 89% lymphocytes and 12%
monocytes, protein of 82 and glucose of 75. CSF culture
negative.
-----
Flow cytometry CSF [**11-3**]: No monotypic B-cell population
identified; most lymphocytes in the specimen are represent by
CD4 positive T-cells.
-----
Cytology CSF [**11-3**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.  Lymphocytes
with reactive changes and monocytes.

IMAGING:
[**11-1**] MRI T spine: Increased signal in the distal spinal cord
indicating cord edema. Subtle irregularity suspicious for flow
voids on the surface of the cord and this finding could indicate
arteriovenous fistula or AVM. No intrinsic hemorrhage is seen
within the spinal cord. Further evaluation with gadolinium
enhanced MRI of the thoracic spine is recommended. Findings were
conveyed to the neurology resident taking care of the patient at
the time of interpretation of this study.

[**11-1**] MRI L spine: Mild multilevel degenerative changes without
spinal stenosis or disc herniation. There are no MRI findings to
explain patient's lower extremity paralysis. Please also see the
thoracic spine MRI of the same day for further evaluation.

[**11-1**] Abd US: No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

[**11-1**] MRI T spine w/contrast: The increased signal in the distal
spinal cord is confirmed on T2 axial images. However, no
evidence of abnormal vascular enhancement seen along the surface
of the cord or to suggest arteriovenous malformation. MRA of the
spine or spinal angiogram would help for further assessment as
clinically indicated.

[**11-2**] CXR: no cardiopulmonary process

[**11-2**] MRI Head w/&w/o contrast: Multiple T2 signal white matter
abnormalities, some of which enhance. These findings may be the
same process that is occurring within the distal thoracic spinal
cord described on the [**2104-11-1**] examination. The differential
includes an inflammatory versus an infectious process. This
could include a demyelinating process such as multiple
sclerosis, or an infectious process such as Lyme disease.
Vasculitis is also a consideration.

[**11-4**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is moderate to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect.  Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

[**11-4**] Chest CT w/contrast:
1.  No evidence of sarcoidosis.
2.  Incidental finding of pulmonary embolus involving the left
lower branch of the pulmonary artery and left lower lobe
segmental branches.  There is Also thrombus in the right upper
lobe branch of the pulmonary artery.
3.  Calcification of the aortic valve as described above.
4.  Gallstone.

[**11-4**] C spine w/contrast: Extensive changes of cervical
spondylosis seen, most significantly at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7
levels resulting in exit neural foraminal stenosis.
Superimposed left paracentral and foraminal herniation is
iden
