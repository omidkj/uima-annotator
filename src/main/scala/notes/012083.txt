Physical Exam:
On arrival [**2144-6-16**]
Vitals: P 90, BP 130/p, RR 16, Sat 98% on BVM, GCS 8
HEENT: Pupals dilated but reactive, C-collar in place
Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly
CV: nl S1, S2 no murmurs
Ext:moving all extremities, 2+DP pulses
Skin: no lacerations

Pertinent Results:
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2144-6-16**] 3:46 PM
NON-CONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE: No fracture or acute alignment
abnormality identified. Vertebral body and disc heights appear
well preserved. There is preservation of cervical lordosis.
Evalauation of soft tissues is limited with endotracheal and
nasogastric tube in place however no obvious abnormality is
noted. Nasogastric tube is coiled in nasopharynx.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of fracture or acute alignment
abnormality.
2) NG tube coiled in nasopharynx.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2144-6-16**] 3:45 PM
NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: Exam is mildly limited due to motion
artifact. Allowing for this, no intracranial hemorrhage, shift
of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major
vascular territorial infarct is apparent. 7 x 13 mm linear left
cerebellar hypodensity may represent a chronic infarct. An NG
tube is coiled within the nasopharynx and a mild- to- moderate
amount of nasal mucosal thickening and ethmoid sinus air cell
opacification is seen. There is a modertae sized right [**Doctor Last Name 13856**]
bullosa. Mastoid air cells are well aerated and no fracture is
identified.
IMPRESSION: 1) No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute
traumatic injury.
2) Possible small left cerebellar chronic infarct, unusual in a
patient of this age. Please correlate clinically.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2144-6-17**] 1:13 PM
IMPRESSION: 1) Total left lower lobe and partial right lower
lobe consolidation with additional ground-glass opacities in the
superior segment of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe,
findings suspicious for aspiration. Superimposed infection
cannot be excluded. 2) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2144-6-18**] 9:26 AM
IMPRESSION:
1) No specific evidence for vertebral artery injury, though
please note that this study is insensitive in evaluating for
vertebral artery dissection.
2) NG tube remains coiled in the nasopharynx.
3) Pansinus opacification, presumably from intubation.
4) Small chronic appearing left cerebellar hemisphere
infarction.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2144-6-25**] 12:20 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute traumatic
injury.
2. Persistent and unchanged small left cerebellar chronic
infarct which is unusual for the patient's age.
3. Right sphenoidal, ethmoidal, and maxillary mucosal thickening
as described above.

 ECHO Study Date of [**2144-6-18**]
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or significant valvular regurgitation
seen, but study is inadequate to exclude endocarditis. Preserved
global biventricular systolic function. Bileaflet mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis present, but function cannot be fully
assessed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 406**] was brought to the ER after an attempted
hanging/suicide in jail on [**2144-6-16**].  On arrival to the ER he was
intubated and transferred to the Trauma SICU. He had CT scans of
his head which showed no evidence of injury and a small left
cerebral infarct that was chronic in nature.  A CT scan of his
C-spine was obtained which showed no evidence of fracture or
alignment abnormality.  He remained intubated and sedated in the
TSICU and received a subclavian central line.  His C-spine was
cleared by a negative 64 slice CT scan and his hard collar was
removed. He was started on a heparin drip in the ICU for his
mechanical aortic valve.  He never responded to the heparin
appropriately and was started on lovenox and coumadin. His INR
on discharge was 1.4. An echocardiogram was obtained and was
negative for valvular vegetations. A CTA of the neck was
negative for carotid injury. He was started on tube feeds on
[**6-18**] which he tolerated well. He remained intubated due to
respiratory failure.  On [**6-19**] he was extubated but required
reintubation due to respiratory failure. A second attempt at
extubation was successful on [**2144-6-21**].  He was then transferred
to the floor on [**2144-6-22**].  On the floor he complained of chest
pain.  A workup showed some ST changes on EKG, but cardiac
enzymes were negative. He was also hypertensive which was
controlled with pain control, hydralizine, metoprolol and
lisinopril. His blood pressure was stable at 117/81 on hospital
discharge. While in the hospital he was also treated for alcohol
and benzo withdrawal. He had a one to one sitter the entire time
on the floor.  Psychiatry consult was obtained once he made it
to the floor.  They recommend psychiatry hospitalization due to
his suicide attempt and substance abuse.  On discharge from the
trauma surgery service he was medically stable.  He will be
directly transferred to the psychiatry service on discharge.  He
was instructed to follow up with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or coumadin clinic
for management of his INR and hypertension.
