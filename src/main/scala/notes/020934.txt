HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old male with
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, no previous cardiac
history admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with
cardiogenic shock and profound acidemia.  Per family's report
patient had increasing pain in his back and hip one day prior
to admission.  He went to [**Hospital3 4298**] emergency
department where he was treated with Dilaudid and Toradol and
sent home.  At home he continued to take Dilaudid,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other uncertain
medications for treatment of his back pain.  He became
increasingly disoriented, clammy, and hallucinating per his
family.  He complained of abdominal pain the day of admission
in addition to pruritus.  His family noted no p.o. intake, no
urine output, and that he was unable to ambulate by the
evening of the day of admission and, thus, they called
emergency medical services.

In the ambulance he had large hematemesis and at [**Hospital6 4299**] was in ventricular fibrillation arrest.  He
was shocked times one, received epinephrine times three and
atropine times two with successful achievement of a pulse.
He was started on a Dopa drip.  ABG at 7:55 p.m. on
[**2131-9-10**] on a nonrebreather was 6.76/62/128.  He was Med
flighted to [**Hospital6 256**].  ABG at
12:08 a.m. intubated was 6.80/71/94.  CTA and CT of the head
on arrival were negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Status post hernia repair.
4.  Left knee arthroscopy.
5.  Osteoarthritis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ibuprofen 1200 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zocor 40 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Altace 10 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Dilaudid times two days.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a psychiatrist.  He lives in
[**State 51454**]., with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has several kids whom
are involved with his kids.  He is a former smoker with
history of occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 70s to 90s
systolically/50s diastolically, heart rate 60s to 70s,
respiratory rate of 15, oxygen saturation 94% on the
ventilator.  In general, the patient is intubated,
nonresponsive, and cyanotic.  HEENT:  Pupils are fixed,
dilated, no oculocephalic reflex, no corneal, no gag.
Cardiovascular:  Tachy, unable to assess for murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Neck veins are flat.  Pulmonary:  Coarse breath
sounds throughout.  Abdomen:  Distended, quiet, no masses or
organomegaly, guaiac positive on rectal exam.  Extremities:
Cool, mottled, no edema or clubbing.  Neuro:  Per HEENT exam,
occasional myoclonic jerks.

LABORATORY DATA AND DIAGNOSTICS:  White count 3.1, hematocrit
45, PTT 76.4, INR 2.6, potassium 6.5, bicarbonate 10,
creatinine 4.6, CK 5829, CK-MB 234, troponin T 0.74.  Serial

ABGs:  Number 1: 6.80/71/94, Number 2: 6.89/78/80, Number 3:
6.9/69/61.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 114, normal axis,
first-degree AV block, inferior T-wave inversion.  Subsequent
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 114, normal axis,
first-degree AV block, borderline QRS prolongation, T-wave
inversion in 2, 3, and AVF.

CT of the chest and abdomen:  Pulmonary edema, large pleural
effusions, no aortic dissection, question of air in the
pericardial sac.  On the abdominal CT:  Right adrenal
adenoma, otherwise within normal limits.

CT of the head:  No hemorrhage or infarct.  Question of
decreased white differentiation.

Chest x-ray:  Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, and bilateral
effusions.

Bedside 2D echo:  Preliminary read shows no effusions, no
tamponade, biventricular failure, global hypokinesis with
right and left ventricular dysfunction.  Right ventricle is
moderately enlarged.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On patient's arrival Vascular Surgery was
consulted.  Upon their review of the CT they found no
aneurysm.  Cardiology was consulted for a bedside echo, which
reviewed no tamponade but global hypokinesis.  At this time
the Medical Intensive Care Unit team was called for further
management of the patient.  Plan was initiated for pressors
and aggressive intravenous fluids to maintain the patient's
blood pressure.  His low blood pressure inhibited diuresis
for his hypoxic respiratory failure likely to significant
congestive heart failure in the context of a significant AA
gradient.  Management of this issue instead involved
increasing his PEEP as his blood pressure tolerated.  In
addition, attempts were made to increase his minute
ventilation for correction of his severe acidemia.

At approximately 4 a.m. the patient's blood pressure began
decreasing despite maximal doses of Levophed, Neo-Synephrine,
Dopamine, Dobutamine, and wide open fluids at a blood
pressure of 34/palp.  Pacer pads were applied and a code was
called.  One amp of epinephrine and one amp of Atropine were
given intravenously.  However, sinus tachycardia degraded to
asystole, and CPR was begun.  Attempts were made to
externally pace but were unsuccessful.  Code efforts ceased
after approximately five minutes given the patient's
preceding hypoxia and acidemia.  Patient's family was
notified and are requesting a post mortem examination.
