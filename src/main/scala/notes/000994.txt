Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with tracheal stent removal


History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 64F with a hx of COPD, fibromyalgia,
Factor V leiden c/b DVT and CVA, and tracheobronchomalacia s/p
tracheal y-stent on [**2188-3-27**], stent removal [**2188-10-27**] for chronic
infections and mesh tracheoplasty [**11/2188**] who presented with 1
day of dyspnea and hypoxia and admitted to the MICU for airway
monitoring and bipap prior to bronchoscopy.
.
She states that the woke up and thereafter noticed SOB and
checked her O2 sat using her husband's pulse ox and was at 85%
at rest on RA. She then used some of her husband's O2 by nasal
cannula (unclear dose) which brought her O2 to 99%. She ate
breakfast and showered and began coughing junky grey and brown
material. She then called her pulmonologist, who told her to
come to the ED. She otherwise denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, change in appetite, rashes, swelling, or any other
symptoms.
.
Of note, patient recently underwent outpatient evaluation for
dyspnea by IP who has been following including CT trachea which
demonstrated malacic changes in the upper 3-4cm's of her
trachea, PFT's which demonstrated low lung volumes (TLC 76%
predicted, FEV1/FVC 104% predicted), and bronchoscopy ([**5-21**])
with dynamic maneuvers demonstrated severe cervical
tracheomalacia, moderate bronchomalacia at the bronchus
intermedius, but otherwise no malacia elsewhere. A 15-12-12 Y
stent cut to a length of 4.5cm was deployed and pt was started
on Mucinex, Albuterol, and Mucomyst nebs. Two days later she
contact[**Name (NI) **] the IP office with complaint of dyspnea but denied
symptoms of plugging and described using the mucinex and nebs as
prescribed but poor compliance of spiriva leading IP to believe
her symptoms were more related to her COPD. She called the IP
office again on the day of admission and felt her symptoms were
related to plugging of her stent so she was advised to proceed
to the ED for further evaluation.
.
ED Course:
In the ED, initial VS were T 99.4, HR 110, BP 135/88, RR 16, 99%
on RA. She was evaluated by the IP team in the ED, who expressed
concern for possible mucous plugging and recommended taking to
the patient to the OR for bronchoscopy. CXR wnl's. She received
nebs with albuterol and racemic epinephrine as well as 80 mg IV
solumedrol and zofran 4 mg IV for nausea. ICU admission was
recommended as patient may require BIPAP as well as close
monitoring post-bronchoscopy. Transfer vitals were T 98.4 ??????F, HR
89, RR 20, BP 121/67, O2 Sat 98% on RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: 99.6, 101, 146/83, 14,
100%3LNC. She confirms the above history and denies significant
symptoms other than some discomfort with breathing and a
moderate headache which she often has.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 64F with a hx of COPD, fibromyalgia, Factor
V leiden c/b DVT and CVA, and tracheobronchomalacia s/p s/p mesh
tracheoplasty [**11/2188**] and y-stent [**5-21**] who presented with 1 day
of dyspnea and hypoxia and admitted to the MICU for airway
monitoring and bipap prior to bronchoscopy.
.
# Hypoxia/Concern for Stent Plugging/Possible COPD Exacerbation:
Pt with extensive tracheomalacia history on top of mild-moderate
COPD without home O2 requirement presenting with repeated
episodes of dyspnea following tracheal stent placement [**5-21**]
concerning for mucous plugging. On exam, she is without
significant stridor or upper airway sounds and without wheezes.
While she does not currently have frank fevers, CXR infiltrates,
or lung exam findings c/w pneumonia she does report history of
productive cough that is different from her baselime sputum,
temperatures are elevated, and she is somewhat diaphoretic
raising possibility of COPD exacerbation. Unfortunately she has
multiple antibiotic allergies which would make therapy selection
more difficult. Interventional Pulmonology took the patient to
the OR for bronchoscopy and removed the stent. They noted
granulation tissue around the stent with mucous which was the
likely cause of her dyspnea. They also removed some fo the
granulation tissue. She was observed in the ICU for 4 hours
after the procedure with O2 sat of 98 while ambulating on RA.
Patient received methyl prednisolone while in the ICU and was
discharged on 4 days of 40mg prednisone per IP recommendations.
She will follow up with both IP and Thoracic surgery for
eventual surgical repair of her tracheomalacia.
.
# COPD: Patient on no home O2, without wheezes on exams, only
home med is spiriva. Patient's O2 saturation was monitored
continously while in the ICU and was placed on PRN nebulized
albuterol and ipratropium without issue.
.
# GERD: Stable. Perhaps a causative factor in her
tracheomalacia. Patient was continued on ranitidine and
omeprazole and tums.
.
# Fibromyalgia/Migraines: Stable. Patient was continued on her
home gabapentin, citalopram, cyclobenzaprine.
