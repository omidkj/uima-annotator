History of Present Illness:
65 yo Male with CKD, DM, recent hospitalization for CHF
exacerbation/pulm edema, found to have new LBBB, transferred for
cardiac cath. He was recently admitted with decompensation in
heart failure 10 d ago and opted for medical management at that
time. Echo done then showed EF 25-30% with apical and anterior
hypokinesis. He presented again on Friday with pulmonary edema
and was treated with Lasix, zaroxylyn and dialysis on Saturday
with improvement. He normally gets Dialysis in [**Location (un) **] on a
MON- WED FRI.  He was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath.  At time of transfer, lungs were clear, sats hight
90s on r/a. Vital signs on transfer: temp 97.9, hr 88 sinus with
lbbb, rr 14, bp 114/67.  Of note, he was recently started on
75/25 for diabetes d/t high sugars.  Sugar today 138, NPO since
MN, no coverage prior to transfer.
.
He underwent cardiac cath which showed extensive 3 vessel
disease.
Currently, he reports no complaints. No pain.  Would like to eat
immediately.

IMAGING:
Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selelctive coronary angiography in this left dominant system
revealed
3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LM had a ostial 35%
stenosis. The
LAD was heavily calcified; proximal-mid diffuse 50% involving D3
and S1,
followed by 70% at S2; mild-moderate origin stenoses of modest
caliber
diffusely diseased D1-D3; mid 40-50% at tiny D4 after S2; mid
90% after
large D5; diffuse disease in distal LAD which wraps around the
apex. The
LCx was heavily calcified; proximal 55%; major OM1 proximal 80%
after
OM2; LPDA proximal 90% (after LPLs). RCA was non-dominant;
proximal
diffuse disease to 70%.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left
sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 38mmHg. There was severe
pulmonary
artery hypertension with a PASP of 64mmHg. There was a preserved
cardiac
index of 2.36L/min/m2. There was normal systemic arterial
pressure of
118/81mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe diffuse three vessel CAD in a left dominant system.
2. Severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure in setting of
newly
diagnosed severe left ventricular systolic heart failure.
3. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Succesful removal of LUE arterial and venous sheaths with
good
hemostasis.
5. Urgent dialysis today given left-sided filling pressures
approaching
40mmHg.
6. Cardiac surgery evaluation for suitability for CABG.
7. D/C plavix. No prasugrel.
8. Reinforce secondary preventative measures against CAD, MI,
severe LV
systolic and diastolic heart failure.

Vein mapping:
IMPRESSION: Small thickened bilateral greater saphenous and left
short
saphenous veins.

Viability study (FDG-PET):
IMPRESSION: 1. No activity in the LV apex. 2. Greatly diminished
activity in the mid and apical inferior wall. 3. Preserved
activity in the anterior wall. 4. Diminished, but present
activity in the septum and lateral wall.

TTE (s/p diuresis and CVVH):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20
%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild
to moderate ([**11-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-11**],
the left ventricular cavity size is slightly smaller with
similar systolic function. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is slightly lower.


Brief Hospital Course:
66-year-old male with CAD, systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 20-25
%), diabetes, CKD stage V recently initiated on HD, PAD, HL with
recent silent NSTEMI vs. demand ischemia leading to acute heart
failure and resultant fluid overload transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for c.
cath showing severe three vessel disease.

# Coronary artery disease: Patient with known CAD with elevated
troponin in setting of heart failure exacerbation who presented
recently to [**Hospital3 4107**] with two heart failure episodes with
dyspnea likely in setting of ischemia given elevated troponin,
new LBBB on EKG, and severe cardiomyopathy on ECHO. C. cath
showing severe three vessel disease with subsequent cardiac
surgery consult. ECHO at [**Hospital1 18**] showed LVEF 15% with dilated left
ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction most
consistent with multivessel CAD.  Decision was made to obtain a
PET CT viability study. The interpretation of the study is as
follows: Normal tracer uptake is seen in the basal and mid
anterior left ventricular myocardium. FDG avidity is mildly
diminished in the septum and lateral wall compared to the
anterior wall.No FDG avidity is seen in the apex. Activity is
greatly diminished in the mid and apical inferior wall, with
preservation of the basal inferior wall. The LV cavity is
enlarged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Diffuse
coronary artery calcifications are seen.  IMPRESSION: 1. No
activity in the LV apex. 2. Greatly diminished activity in the
mid and apical inferior wall. 3. Preserved activity in the
anterior wall. 4. Diminished, but present activity in the septum
and lateral wall. The CT surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**] did not feel
that he was an appropriate surgical candidate and potential
risks outweighe
