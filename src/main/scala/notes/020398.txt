History of Present Illness:
49F with hx of GERD, hypothyroidism, IBS and depression
transferred from OSH per patient request for multifocal
pneumonia and hypoxia. Briefly, patient initially presented to
[**Hospital 1514**] Hospital on [**4-30**] complaining of N/V/D and RUQ abdominal
pain following 2 antibiotics courses prescribed and ENT
evaluation for sinusitis. She had leukocytosis of 13 without
bandemia, normal chemistries, and had a CT abd/pelvis showing
mild proximal small bowel wall thickening c/w regional enteritis
and a RUQ U/S which was negative for cholecystitis. She was
admitted to the medical floor for managment of gastroenteritis.
She thereafter developed hypoxia and cough as well as severe
basilar headaches without photophobia, phonophobia, neck
stiffness, or neurological symptoms. She had a CTA chest which
was negative for PE but bibasilar infiltrates and CXR was c/w
with extensive bilateral pneumonia as well as a non-con CT scan
of her head which was negative. Also, urine legionella Ag
negative and pneumococcal antigen was also negative. She was
initially started on azithromycin and rocephin which was changed
to zosyn and cipro due to worsening hypoxia on nasal cannula.
She had a pulmonary consultation and was started on solumedrol
40mg Q6hrs and given a single dose of IV lasix 20mg with good
UOP. Family sought transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
