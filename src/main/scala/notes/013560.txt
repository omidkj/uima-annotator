Brief Hospital Course:
Upon presentation to the [**Hospital1 69**],
the patient was immediately admitted to the Crimson Surgical
Service.  A full work-up was done, including a CT scan of the
abdomen, which showed organoaxial gastric volvulus.  A decision
was made to take the patient to the operating room.  The patient
tolerated the procedure [please see operative note for further
details].  Post-operative, she was immediately admitted to the
surgical intensive care unit.  She remained intubated until day
2 post-op.  She remained in the SICU for a total of 7 days,
where treatment of pre-admission pneumonia was started with IV
Zosyn.  On post-op day 2, her tubefeeds were started.

She was continued on Zosyn after being transferred to the
surgical floor.  Her white blood count improved and her
antibiotics was switched to Levofloxacin.  It remained within
normal limits until it up-trended when levofloxacin was removed.
 Hence, levofloxacin was restarted.

She was pan-cultured several times.  Only yeast grew from her
urine culture.  She was appropriately treated with Fluconazole.

During her hospital stay, the Physical Therapy team as well as
Nursing has help her regain some of her strength.

On day of discharge, she had been tolerating her tubefeeds,
while producing adequate flatus, stool, and urine.  She has been
ambulating with assistance.  She had remained afebrile
throughout her hospital stay while her white blood count was
normalizing to normal limits.  She has remained NPO [and needs
to remain NPO until at least seen in clinic].

She was discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation
center with specific intructions for post-hospital care and
follow-up.
