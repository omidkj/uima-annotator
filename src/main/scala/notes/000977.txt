Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for STEMI/cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, placement of two stents in the left
dircumflex coronary artery.
Placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.
Placement of Swan-Ganz catheter via femoral access.
Cardioversion x 3 for ventricular tachycardia.
Emergent repeat cardiac catheterization.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year old male transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from an
OSH for STEMI, in cardiogenic shock on pressors.

Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2112-9-11**] with SOB
and chest pain of approximately 1 wk duration. In OSH ED, was
found to have RML PNA. He also reported fall one week prior with
facial ecchymosis, found to have nasal fx by CT. EKG showed
sinus tach in the 130s with Qs in II,III,aVF with nl. axis and
intervals and T-waves inverted in inferior leads and ST
depressions in the lateral leads. Pt received ASA, b-blockers,
morphine, nitro paste, levaquin and was pain-free with sats in
the 90%s on 100%NRB. Troponin was 0.525 with flat CK. T max
99.1. WBC 15.9, Hct 44.5%. Received lovenox sq, with last dose
at 12am [**2112-9-12**].
On [**9-12**] at noon, pt became SOB and diaphoretic with pain, and
sats fell to 77% on 100%NRB with HR120. Received 40mg of lasix,
4mg morphine, and was intubated at 12:30pm. At 1pm, EKG showed
sinus at 100, nl intervals and axis with Qs in III & aVF, ST
elevations in III>II, and ST depressions in I,aVL. Blood
pressure fell s/p intubation to 60s/20s requiring fluid
resuscitation and dopamine 10mcg/kg/min. O2 sats rose to 88% on
AC700mlx14/min + 5PEEP. CXR showed worsening of a R lung
alveolar process with extrusion to the L side, with a
differential of infection vs R>L pulmonary edema.  Patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

CATH [**2112-9-12**]: LMCA had a 40% lesion. LAD had diffuse luminal
irregularities but was free of significant stenoses and supplied
2 moderate-sized diagonal branches which were also free of
significant disease. LCX had a hazy 60% lesion in the mid
vessel and a hazy 80% lesion in the distal vessel. The RCA was a
small
vessel and was totally occluded in the mid segment. A R-PDA was
seen
filling via L-R collaterals. Resting hemodynamics revealed
evidence of cardiogenic shock with an aortic pressure of 94/53
mmHg, a cardiac index of 1.3 L/min/m2 and a
PCWP of 30 mmHg on an infusion of dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min.
stented
with a 3.5 x 13 mm cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 55492**] and 3.0 x 13 mm cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 22595**] at 14 atms with no residual stenosis, no dissection and
timi 3
flow.

Transthoracic Echo [**2112-9-13**]:
EF 70% The overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal
(borderline
hyperdynamic) but the lateral wall and adjacent segments of
anterior free wall
are hypokinetic relative to the frankly hyperdynamic inferior
and posterior
walls. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2112-9-12**], the cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with ventricular
tachycardia;
the lateral wall (which now appears relatively hypokinetic) was
not
well-visualized on the prior study; therefore no direct
comparison of
contractile function in this territory can be made.

Transesophageal Echo [**2112-9-13**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
leaflets are
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe posterior mitral leaflet
prolapse. There
is partial mitral leaflet flail. There is moderate thickening of
the mitral
valve chordae. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU service after his
catheterization. Overall the following weeks the pt was
determined to be extremely sick with multiple organ system
failure. He needed a mitral valve replacement surgery, however,
in order to have this surgery he would need to be extubated and
afebrile. He was treated with hemodialysis and further diuresis
was attempted with IV diuretics and BNP, however the pt's
respiratory status remained tenuous. Furthermore, he did not
wake up when sedation was weaned. He was evaluated by Neuro with
an EEG that showed only diffuse slowing and a head CT that
showed no acute changes. It was felt likely that due to his
episodes of hypotension with the VT and other hemodynamic
instability later that he had sustained anoxic brain injury.
This was all discussed with the family who felt that the pt
would not have wanted to be kept alive on a ventilator long-term
when any hope of recovery was extremely slim. As all attempts to
wean him from the ventilator were unsuccessful he was made CMO
and made comfortable with morphine. He died shortly after.
