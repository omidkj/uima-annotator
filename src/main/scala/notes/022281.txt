CT abd:
1. New bowel wall thickening consistent with colitis involving
the ascending and transverse colon. Probable patchy areas of
thickening within the sigmoid and descending colon also. This
may be secondary to a low flow ischemia. If the sigmoid and
descending colon are also affected, this may be secondary to
infection. No obstruction, pneumatosis or abscess is identified.
2. New cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe with surrounding
patchy opacities. This is in the location of a previously seen
consolidation which has mostly resolved.
3. Liver transplant and common bile duct stents are
unremarkable. No free air or intrahepatic biliary dilatation
identified.
4. Diffuse soft tissue stranding within the mesentery and
subcutaneous soft tissues consistent with anasarca. Small
pericardial effusion.

RUQ u/s: Unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound.

CT head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema or
abnormal areas of post- contrast enhancement.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 57853**] was admitted on [**2115-9-11**] for fever, headache, n/v,
and subjective left UE/LE numbness and weakness for one day.
Given her recent biliary stent placement the day before,
elevated WBC with 85% N and 7 bands, and her high-grade fever of
104, she was started on empiric Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and
Vancomycin, while her studies were pending. CT of the head was
negative for increased ICP, and diagnostic LP performed was
negative for any meningitis. U/S of the abdomen was negative for
any biliary perforation. Her abdominal CT showed new bowel wall
thickening consistent with colitis involving the ascending and
transverse colon, with probable patchy areas of thickening
within the sigmoid and descending colon also. She was initially
stable when transferred to the floor, but was febrile to 101 and
tachycardic. The next morning, [**2115-9-12**], her SBO dropped to the
60's and her blood cultures returned at 4/4 bottles + for GNRs.
She was transferred to the ICU for further management for E.coli
sepsis/bacteremia and pressures.

While in the MICU -

1) Sepsis - Her initial blood cultures were 4/4 bottles positive
for gram negative rods.  Given her history of ESBL in the past,
she was covered with Imipenim and gentamicin.  On hospital day
2, the bacteria was identified as ESBL e.coli that was sensitive
to meropenem.  She was started on a 14 day course of meropenem.
 Surveillance cultures have been negative.  She became
hypotensive requiring fluid boluses and pressors.  By hospital
day 3, the pressors were weaned and she no longer required fluid
boluses.  Since she has been on chronic prednisone, she was
treated with stress dose steroids fludrocortisone and
hydrocortisone.  Once her pressure was stable on hospital day 3,
she was transitioned from hydrocortisone to a prednisone taper.
The fludrocortisone was stopped on hospital day 4.

2) CHF - Initally she required fluid boluses to maintain her
pressure.  She was gently hydrated and monitored closely to
prevent pulmonary edema.  An ECHO on hospital day 3 showed an EF
of 50-55%, which was increased from 10-20% a few months prior.
The etiology of the increase in EF is unclear.  Once her
pressure was stable, she was restarted on a low dose carvedilol.

3) S/P OLT - She was maintained on her immunosuppression regimen
througout the admission.

4) Thrombocytopenia- This was likely secondary to the acute
infection.  There was no
