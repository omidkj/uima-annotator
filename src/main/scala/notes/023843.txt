Admission Date:  [**2120-6-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-6-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2062-3-7**]     Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year-old male
with past medical history of prostate cancer, status post
radical prostatectomy and hairy-cell leukemia status post
treatment with 2 CdA last does on [**2120-6-1**] who presented on
from [**2120-5-31**] to [**2120-6-5**] the patient had a PIC line
associated thrombophlebitis with MRSA. The patient was
treated with Vancomycin which was later switched to Linezolid
secondary to rash with Vancomycin. The patient was discharged
home with temperatures of approximately 100 F.

The day after admission, the patient had a rise in
associated cough, chest tightness and diarrhea. The patient
was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2120-6-6**] where room air 02
saturation was 97%. The patient was febrile and sputum
studies were planned. The patient then returned home from
clinic.

On [**2120-6-9**] the patient presented to the ED with fever of
102F, heart rate of 110 and blood pressure of 84/38 with a
respiratory rate of 30 and O2 saturation 93% on room air. ABG
at that time showed Po2 of 69. The patient was admitted to
the Fenard ICU service and started on Ceftazidine, Bactrim
and prednisone for presumed PCP which was later changed to
Clindamycin primaquine due to fear of bone marrow
suppression, Levaquin and Linezolid. The  Linezolid was
continued for completion of previous course. The patient was
also given 6 liters of normal saline with increased in blood
pressure to 94/58. Infectious Disease was consulted.
Ceftazidine was discontinued and induced sputum sent for PCP.


Because of enlarged heart on chest x-ray an echocardiogram
was ordered. CT scan of the chest and abdomen were ordered
for better evaluation of the lungs and new onset abdominal
pain.

The patient reports that since the last admission he has had
a nonproductive cough and increasing shortness of breath that
is worse when lying down. He also reports some mild diarrhea
and "searing calf pain" that was initially bilateral then
left greater than right which resolved spontaneously. The
patient also reports continued fever and an unusual amount of
fatigue.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hairy-cell leukemia diagnosed in [**2113**] treated with 2 CdA.
On [**6-8**] the patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
pancytopenia then followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] until
[**5-9**]. Recurrence was diagnosed in [**5-9**] and from [**5-24**] to
[**5-31**] the patient was re-treated with 2 CdA. Treatment was
complicated by PIC line associated septic thrombophlebitis
treated with Vancomycin initially which was then changed to
Linezolid due to diffuse macular papular rash.
2. History of prostate adenocarcinoma status post radical
prostatectomy.
3.  Nephrolithiasis.
4.  Status post hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Vancomycin causes rash. Questionable reaction to
Oxicillin and Allopurinol as these were all given at the same
time Vancomycin was given and is questionable whether these
were responsive for the patient's initial rash.
2.  Intolerance to Codeine which causes nausea and vomiting.
3.  Morphine causes mental status changes.

MEDICATIONS IN THE FENARD ICU:
1.  Linezolid 600 [**Hospital1 **].
2.  Protonix 40 mg q day.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
4.  G-CSF 300 micrograms subcutaneous q day.
5.  Prednisone 40 mg po q day.
6.  Colace.
7.  Peridex.
8.  Primaquine 30 mg po q day.
9.  Levaquin 500 mg po q day.
10. Albuterol inhaler prn.
11. Clindamycin 900 mg IV q eight hours.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:
1.  Linezolid.
2.  Compazine.
3.  Peridex.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs blood pressure 94/58, heart
rate 94, O2 saturation 98% on room air, respiratory rate
approximately 24.

In general the patient is chronically ill appearing, slightly
shortness of breath and pale. HEENT - no thrush. OP is clear.
Heart - normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs -
decreased breath sounds at left base, dullness to percussion
at left base, decreased lung volume secondary to the
patient's inability to take a deep breath. Abdomen -
distended, positive bowel sounds. Liver margin is palpable 2
cm below costal margin. Diffuse tenderness to palpation no
guarding or rebound.  Extremities - left lower extremity
slightly larger than right lower extremity. Trace edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 58 year-old male with hairy-cell
leukemia admitted for fever, hypotension and acute onset of
shortness of breath.

1.  Fever and hypotension - Infectious Disease was consulted
during this admission. Ceftazidine was discontinued when the
patient was no longer neutropenic and the patient was started
on Levaquin for coverage of community acquired pneumonia.
There was low suspicion by the Infectious Disease team for
PCP in this patient. The patient's hypoxia resolved and with
ambulation the patient's O2 saturation was 95 to 96%. The
patient had two induced sputum sent, one of which was
negative and the other of which is pending at the time of
this dictation. After the first induced sputum was negative,
Infectious Disease recommended discontinuing prednisone 40 mg
po q day and discontinuing the Clindamycin primaquine
medications.

Infectious Disease at first was concerned over a possible
fungal infection. However CT scan of the chest did not reveal
any cavitary lesions and the patient did not worsen. No
antifungal medications were started during this
hospitalization and it was thought there was low probability
the patient had a fungal lung infection due to his clinical
improvement without any treatment.

A chest x-ray revealed a left retrocardiac density which
could be either consolidation versus atelectasis. Considering
that the patient had fevers and a cough it was thought most
likely that this consolidation likely represented a
pneumonia. The patient was continued on Levaquin and
continued to defervesce. T max was 100.4 F on day prior to
discharge. The patient's overall fever curve continued to
decrease.  At the time of this dictation the patient was
afebrile for 24 hours.

The patient will be discharged home on Levaquin to complete a
14 day course to cover for community acquire pneumonia and
any atypicals.

The patient had several blood cultures sent, urine cultures,
crypto antigen, micro plasma antigen, CMV antigen, histo
antigen and EBV titer sent. All of which have been negative
thus far. The patient as mentioned above had induced sputum
sent for PCP the first of which had been negative and the
second of which is still pending at the time of this
dictation. There has been no obvious source for the patient's
fevers at this time.

2.  Cardiac - Because of the enlarged cardiac silhouette seen
on chest x-ray and hypotension, an echocardiogram was done to
evaluate for ejection fraction. The echocardiogram revealed
surprisingly global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of
20 to 25% and 2+ MR. There was relative preservation of the
lateral wall and trace TR. In light of these new echo
findings cardiology was consulted. The patient had no
previous history of any cardiac disease. Cardiology reviewed
the data and believed the patient's new onset cardiomyopathy
may be secondary to 2 CdA. There is one reported case of 2
CdA induced cardiomyopathy however this is a very rare
complication of the medication and only one case report has
been published. It was thought unlikely that the patient had
myocarditis due to the relative low cardiac enzymes. The
patient did have a slight Troponin leak with Troponin max of
2.3.

The patient was started on treatment for congestive heart
failure with Lasix, Captopril, and Carvedilol. The patient's
blood pressure continued to rise and was at bas
