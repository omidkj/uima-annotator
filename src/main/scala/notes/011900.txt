tumor decreased in size but never resolved.  On followup,

Postoperatively, she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
Her postoperative course in the Intensive Care Unit was
notable for a slow wean from ventilatory support and
aspiration pneumonia.  She also had tachycardia secondary to
intraoperative blood loss with a postoperative hematocrit of
less than 25.  The tachycardia resolved after blood
transfusion.  For her aspiration pneumonia, she was placed on

The remainder of her hospitalization was uneventful.  She
tolerated tube feeds well.  She ambulated well.

She was discharged to home with services on [**2123-6-14**].  At
the time of discharge, she still had sutures in her neck
incision.  There was ecchymosis and superficial skin
breakdown at the right upper edge of her skin flap.  This
area of skin ecchymosis and breakdown was stable.

The results of the pathology examination of her surgical

base.  She also had a positive node at level 2 of her right
