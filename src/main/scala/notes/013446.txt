History of Present Illness:
HPI: 47yo tob+ M with hx of PE ([**2138**], previously on coumadin
which was d/c'd one year ago) and HTN who has been non-copmliant
with his medications for the last two month (change in PCP/loss
of insurance) who presents to [**Hospital6 3105**] with
non-radiating SSCP associated with SOB. The wife reports the pt
has been complaining of some cough with subjective fevers for
one week prior to admission. During this time, he has also
complained of some intermittent bilateral lower leg pain. He was
brought in to the ED by his wife today due to rapid shallow
breathing. The SSCP came on suddently and was persistent at
[**10-8**]. The pain was described as a tightness resulting in
"hyperventilation" - SOB and cough. The SSCP and SOB was worse
with lying flat, exercise, or deep breath and was relieved by
nothing. VS were significant for 300/170, 132, 60 -> the pt was
started on a nitro gtt with improvement in his VS. However his
BP then dropped to 88/58 (leading to addition of levophed gtt
transient), with HR of 95. On exam he was noted to have mottled
skin, and appeared pale and diaphoretic. The pt received 100mg
lasix IV x1, NTG gtt at 120mcg/min. and 20mg Morphine. The pt
became acutely hypoxic resulting in intubation with 20mg
Etomidate, 100mg Succinylcholine, 4mg Ativan, and Vecurronium.
Vent setting were as follows: AC: 650x12, PEEP: 5, SpO2: 95%;
ABG: 7.0/105.2/110. A CTA was performed (neg by verbal report,
pending fax of official report). The pt received an ASA 325mg PO
x1 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up. Labs at OSH
were significant for proteinuria, elevated BNP of 1295 (0-100
wnl), slightly elevated CE (CK-MB 7.6 (0.6-6.3 wnl)) and WBC:
19.4 (Band 1, Neutrophil 47, Lymph 20, Mono 7, Eos 4, Atypical
Lymph 21).
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the pt was found to have VS consisting of: T: 96,
HR: 59, BP: 94/56, RR: 21, SaO2: 100% on ventilator with
nitrogg. He was intubated and sedated on AC: 600x16, PEEP: 5,
FiO2: 100%. CXR performed demonstrated appropriate placement of
ETT and NG tube. In addition, it also demonstrated cardiomegaly
with CHF, R pleural effusion and RLL consolidation with inc.
opacity and air bronchograms. Here, the pt was found to have
elevated WBC count of 18, equivocal CE and was started on hep
gtt. Cardiology reviewed the ECG and declined CCU and emergent
cath.  On transfer to CCU - no chest pain, sob, + rib pain with
deep breaths, no N/V.  No visual changes.  No black or bloody
stools

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**2143-2-24**] 22:34:54: Sinus tach 130; nml-leftward axis; nml
intervals; peaked P waves; ST depression II, III, F; ST
elevations vs. J point in v2, v3; TWI in I, L.
.
ECG [**2143-2-25**] 00:42:44: NSR 60, nml-leftward axis, nml intervals,
P wave size wnl; TWI in III, TW flattening in aVF, J point
elevation in V2, V3, TWI in V4-V6, poor R wave progression.
.
CXR [**2143-2-25**] (wet read): ETT in good position. NG tube below
diaphram. Cardiomegaly with CHF. R pleural effusion. RLL
consolidation with inc. opacity and air bronchograms.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Moderate symmetric LVH.  Mild
LV dilation. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed with mild global hypokinesis and regional
severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Right and Left Heart Catheterization [**2143-2-1**]
BRIEF HISTORY:   47 yr old male with multiple cad risk factors
including
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use presented to hospital
with
pulmonary edema in setting of severely elevated blood pressure
after
self d/c all of his medications.  Echo demonstrated an EF of 40%
with
global LV hypokinesis.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Dilated cardiomyopathy of
unclear
etiology.

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 6 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Left Ventriculography: was performed in the 30 degrees [**Doctor Last Name **]
projection,
using 39 ml of contrast injected at 13 ml/sec, through the
angled
pigtail catheter.
Peripheral Imaging was performed.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
