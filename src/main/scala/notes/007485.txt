This is from the Medical Intensive Care Unit admission intern
admission note.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 25-year-old female
with Crohn's disease on 6MP and chronic prednisone times six
weeks, who was in her usual state of health until [**2148-2-29**] when she began to feel nasal congestion, spiking
temperatures as high at 106.7 degrees Fahrenheit, accompanied
by fevers and shaking chills.  The symptoms were accompanied
by lower extremity myalgias, diarrhea, that was without blood
or mucous and a non-productive cough.

The following day, the patient presented to [**Hospital3 **]
and had a lumbar puncture and a chest x-ray, both of which
were negative for any signs of infection.  She had a normal
white blood cell count at the time with a differential that
later came back as 27% bands.  The patient was treated with
Tylenol and her symptoms persisted.  The patient then
presented two days later to her primary care physician who
placed her on a course of azithromycin for a presumed
atypical pneumonia.  On the day of admission, the primary
care physician reviewed the results of her bandemia from the
outside hospital and asked her to come to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department for further evaluation.

The patient presented to the Emergency Room with low grade
temperatures and then spiked to 105 and became tachycardic
and tachypneic into the 40s.  She then developed an oxygen
requirement up to 15 liters nasal cannula.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient had a chest x-ray which revealed a
right hilar infiltrate and left lower lobe infiltrate.  An
abdominal CT was performed to check for occult abscess which
was negative, however, this showed bibasilar pneumonia in
consolidations.  CT of the head revealed some minor sinus
thickening and no other abnormalities.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given a dose of
intravenous Levaquin and transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for impending respiratory failure.

Patient gives a history of recent travel to [**State 108**] in [**Month (only) 958**]
in which she swam in a pool but no sick contacts.

an oral contraceptive.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a financial manager at
Fleet's.  Married.  No tobacco, no alcohol or intravenous
drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a
grandmother with rheumatoid arthritis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 130/80.
Pulse 104.  Respiratory rate of 50, oxygenation 74% on room
air up to 90% on a nonrebreather.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Mucous membranes dry.  General:  Diaphoretic and
tachypneic.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Lungs:  Right lower lobe crackles, good air
movement.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no organomegaly.  Extremities without edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 8,
hematocrit 35.2, platelet count 242,000.  Differential of 80,
7% polys, 9% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes.  Sodium 130,
potassium 3.6, chloride 96, bicarbonate 23, BUN 9, creatinine
0.7, glucose 154.  Chest x-ray with mild right hilar
infiltrate and left lower lobe infiltrate.  CT of the head
with sinus thickening.  CT of the abdomen:  No abscess, but
bibasilar pneumonia with small effusions.  Electrocardiogram:
Sinus tachycardia at 158, normal axis, no ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Pneumonia:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for impending respiratory failure and
maintained on a 100% nonrebreather mask.  Her initial
arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45, a pCO2 of 26 and a
PO2 of 82 on the 100% nonrebreather.  The patient was started
on prednisone 40 mg b.i.d. and Bactrim for suspected PCP
pneumonia given her immunosuppression, as well as Levaquin
500 mg po q.d. for question of community acquired pneumonia
or atypical pneumonia.  The patient spent one night in the
Intensive Care Unit and was weaned off of her 100%
nonrebreather down to two liter nasal cannula.  She was then
called out to the floor.  Her Bactrim was discontinued as she
did have a rash develop to this that did go away after the
Bactrim was discontinued with a lower suspicion of PCP given
her CT finding of dense consolidations, a negative LDH.  Her
Bactrim was discontinued and another anti-PCP medication was
not continued.  Her sputum did return negative for PCP times
one.  Her sputum also was negative for legionella antigen, as
well as her urine negative for legionella.  Her sputum did
not grow out any pathogenic organisms and was shown to have
oropharyngeal flora, however, the patient did not have a
large sputum production and this was a small induced sample.
It is likely that the patient had a bacterial pneumonia given
her radiologic picture, although, legionella is still a
possibility and her negative urine antigen might have been
because she had already been treated with antibiotics.  The
patient did improve and was on room air with a trending
oxygen saturation of 97% upon discharge.

2.  Anemia:  The patient had a microcytic anemia with a
hematocrit that came down to 25 after fluids.  The anemia was
microcytic with an MCV of 73.  Iron studies showed an iron of
38, a TIBC of 251, a ferritin of 69, transferrin of 193.
These were thought to be consistent with a mild iron
deficiency anemia and she was started on iron.  Her
reticulocyte count, however, was 0.3 and this may have been
suppressed in the setting of acute illness.

3.  Crohn's disease:  Her abdominal CT was not consistent
with a Crohn's flare and her mild loose stools were thought
to be secondary to her illness rather than her Crohn's
disease.  She was weaned back down from the initial 40 mg po
b.i.d. Bactrim she had been put on for PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 5 mg per day
that she was taking for her Crohn's.  She was continued on
her Asacol as per Dr.[**Name (NI) 34758**] recommendations.

4.  Increased LFTs:  The patient's ALT did go up to 234 and
AST to 93.  This was thought to be either secondary to her
reaction to Bactrim versus her pneumonia.  These did trend
down after her Bactrim was stopped.  They can be followed out
for continued downtrending to normal as an outpatient.  The
patient had no other associated findings of liver disease,
including no abdominal pain, no elevated alkaline phosphatase
and a normal total bilirubin.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged home.

FOLLOW-UP:  She will follow-up with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 34759**], tomorrow and follow-up with her
gastroenterologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2643**] next week.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia, likely bacterial.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions likely secondary to
pneumonia.
3.  Microcytic anemia, likely iron deficiency.
4.  Increased LFTs, now trending down, likely secondary to
Bactrim reaction.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg per tablet, 1 po q.d. for eight more
days to complete a 14 day course.
2.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po q.d. for gastrointestinal
prophylaxis on steroids.
3.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg po t.i.d.
4.  Vitamin D 400 units q.d. for bone prophylaxis on
steroids.
5.  Ibuprofen 800 mg po t.i.d.
6.  Prednisone 5 mg po q.d.
7.  Iron sulfate 325 mg po q.d.
