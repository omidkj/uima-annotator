Chief Complaint:
Neutropenic fever, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old man with a history of diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma s/p IVAC D11 who presents with fever, nausea and
vomiting of 1 day duration. He was feeling overall well until
this morning when he developed a fever of 102. He vomited twice
(bilious, non-bloody). Denies abdominal pain or diarrhea. Denies
cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea or headache. Denies sick contacts
though was concerned his milk was old. Denies shortness of
breath or chest pain. Denies rashes. Does report increased
urinary frequency but no dysuria. Yesterday he went to his
outpatient oncology appointment, received 1 unit platelets with
no complications and felt well enough to walk home.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.3, BP 112/89, HR 94, RR 18,
100% NRB. During ED course Tmax 102.7. He was noted to be in
AFib at a rate of 135-160 which improved without intervention.
O2 sat 98-100% 2L. BP dropped to 76 and he was given 5L NS and
started on levophed. He received vancomycin and cefepime before
being transferred to the ICU. On arrival to the ICU patient was
actively rigoring.
.
Patient recently admitted [**Date range (3) 21959**] and treated with IVAC
chemotherapy x 5 days which was complicated by neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, dizziness and diarrhea. Hospital stay was also
complicated by Atrial Fibrillation treated with metoprolol and
digoxin. Patient also has history of pulmonary embolism ([**10-15**]
admission) felt to be secondary to right atrial
catheter-associated thrombus complicated by likely TIA/amaurosis
fugax. Patient was treated with fondaparinux but this was then
stopped last admission due to thrombocytopenia.
.
ROS: The patient denies melena, hematochezia, chest pain,
shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema,
cough, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness,
vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented in early [**6-/2197**] with fever, weight
loss, and muscle and joint aches. He was diagnosed with PMR and
started on prednisone with improvement in his symptoms. During
the preceding six months, he reported a history of the
generalized body pain as well as fatigue, weakness, and poor
appetite. He also reported periodic fevers, drenching night
sweats, and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six
months. Marked improvement of both his musculoskeletal and
constitutional symptoms after prednisone treatment. He then
presented to the emergency room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations
and dizziness and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. He has
had a history of PAF in the past. He was febrile to 101.6 with a
heart rate of 126. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on
showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver,
spleen, and kidneys with characteristics felt atypical for
lymphoma. A follow-up MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular
masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent
with lymphoma. Mr. [**Known lastname **] then underwent bone marrow aspirate and
biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal
involvement by a high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large
B-cell type. FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2
indicating a "double hit" lymphoma characterized by a
Burkitt's-like lymphoma.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has overall tolerated his chemotherapy relatively well.
He has continued on his Fondaparinux daily when on [**2197-11-16**],
he noted sudden onset sudden of a dark cover in the lower half
of the visual field in his right eye, which lasted [**10-20**]
minutes, then self-resolved. He presented to the emergency room
for evaluation. TEE revealed thrombus at the tip of his right
atrial catheter, with no PFO. Ophthalmology work up was negative
and the episode was attributed to TIA with recommendation to
continue fondaparinux. He was discharged on [**2197-11-18**] with no
further episodes.
.
TREATMENT HISTORY:
1. Initiated treatment with [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy on [**2197-7-29**]
with two doses of Rituxan on [**2197-8-2**] and [**2197-8-3**]. Follow
up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions
in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.
2. Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening
and admission for neutropenia. During admission, noted for
atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125
mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily.
3. Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **]
chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension
and cough. A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe
opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and
he was treated with a course of Levaquin.
4. On [**2197-8-30**], received Rituxan at 375 mg/m2.
5. Follow up PET scan on [**2194-9-6**] showed no evidence for
lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary
opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central
lucencies most of which were new. He underwent CT of the chest
for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects
within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right
lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli.
6. Admitted on [**2197-9-7**] for initiation of anticoagulation with
fondaparinux and began third cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2197-9-8**](dose level 2)
7. Received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on [**2197-9-25**].
8. Admitted on [**2197-9-29**] for fourth cycle of treatment with
[**Hospital1 **](dose level 3).
9. Received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on [**2197-10-17**].
10. Admitted on [**2197-10-20**] for fifth cycle of treatment with
[**Hospital1 **](dose level 3 with Adriamycin at dose level 2. Received
Rituxan on [**2197-11-7**].
11. Admitted on [**2197-11-23**] for high-dose cyclophosphamide.
12. Admitted on [**2198-1-15**] for IVAC (originally admitted for
high-dose MTX, but PET scan showed progressive disease).
.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's like with c-Myc and
Bcl-2 positivity s/p [**Hospital1 **] x 5 cycles and multiple rituxan
infusions. He has had recurrent disease within 2 - 3 months of
his last treatment. Patient recently admitted [**Date range (3) 21959**]
for CNS prophylaxis with high-dose MTX for his aggressive
lymphoma. However, PET scan prior to admission was concerning
for rapidly progressive disease and CT torso on admission agreed
with these findings and his LDH continued to rise. He was
therefore started on IVAC chemotherapy x5 days and discharged on
neupogen.
2. PAF diagnosed in [**2180**] with now chronic atrial fibrillation in
the past several months. He had no history of treatment with
anti-arrhythmia or anticoagulation prior to his admission in
[**8-/2197**], currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and
digoxin.
3. Pulmonary embolism, currently receiving treatment with
fondaparinux.
4. Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosed in [**2197**] and managed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], although further treatment on hold while getting
treatment for lymphoma and unclear if his symptoms were related
to lymphoma and not PMR.
5. Remote history of syphilis, gonorrhea, and genital herpes in
[**2160**].
6. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in the [**2137**].
7. Myopia.
8. Recent probable TIA with from thrombus on right atrial
catheter tip
