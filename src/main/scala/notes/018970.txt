Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a
74-year-old man with diabetes, known history of coronary
artery disease, status post LAD stent in [**2157**] who was
admitted to the CCU after cardiac catheterization, no PCI,
showing three vessel disease.  The patient reported to [**Hospital3 6265**] on the day of admission with complaint of chest
discomfort and shortness of breath.  The patient has a
baseline expressive dysphagia, but was able to communicate
the fact that he had chest pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea.

At [**Hospital3 3583**], the patient was noted to have ST
depressions in leads I, aVL, V3 through V6.  Cardiac enzymes
revealed a troponin of 34.6, and a CK of 1,428.  The patient
was put on a heparin drip, nitroglycerin drip, and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.  Prior
to transfer, it was noted that the patient had a recent rise
in his baseline creatinine from 1 to 2.0.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Small vessel cerebrovascular accident in [**2159-4-18**] with
residual expressive dysphagia.
5.  Depression.
6.  Head injury in [**2126**] with two seizures.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Norvasc.
2.  Glyburide.
3.  Protonix.
4.  Zoloft.
5.  Lopressor.
6.  Plavix.
7.  MVI.
8.  Folate.
9.  Hydrochlorothiazide.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Blood
pressure 109/56, heart rate 95, respiratory rate 21, 02
saturation 96% on 5 liters.  Pulmonary artery pressures
56/28.  General:  The patient was alert, oriented, in no
apparent distress.  He had some difficulties with verbal
expression.  HEENT:  Moist mucous membranes, EOMI, oropharynx
clear.  Neck: No lymphadenopathy appreciated on examination.
Normal thyroid.  JVD approximately 10 cm.  Lungs:  Coarse
throughout, rales at bases bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Difficult to assess examination given the patient's loud lung
sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated on
examination.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken for cardiac
catheterization given his elevated troponins and history of
chest pain and dyspnea.  The cardiac catheterization revealed
moderately elevated right and left-sided filling pressures
with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.  Three
vessel coronary artery disease.  Moderate diastolic
dysfunction.  After careful consideration, a consensus
decision was made not to stent any of the patient's coronary
artery lesions.  In addition, he was given 40 mg of IV Lasix
for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.  He was
then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further
management.

There, he was evaluated by the team and noted to be in
respiratory distress.  A chest x-ray was obtained which
showed frank pulmonary edema.  He was thus diuresed with IV
Lasix.  The patient produced only moderate amounts of urine
to the diuretic.  An ABG was obtained which showed a pH of
7.31, PC02 40, P02 of 86.  The patient was felt to be
relatively stable with respect to his pulmonary function and
thus was not intubated.

That night, the patient had additional episodes of
respiratory distress.  He was treated with IV nitroglycerin
drip, morphine, and Lasix.  On this regimen, the patient's
dyspnea resolved; however, the following day, the patient
again had additional episodes of dyspnea.  Chest x-ray was
again obtained which showed increased pulmonary edema.  This
was thought to likely be secondary to ischemic cardiogenic
shock.  The patient was thus started on dopamine and
dobutamine.

The following day, these medications were weaned off and the
patient was maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula and CPAP
during his episodes of respiratory distress.  Again, the
patient was not intubated.  The patient's creatinine
continued to rise during his admission.  Thus, a Renal
consult was obtained.  In the setting of worsening renal
function the patient also became slightly acidotic with a pH
of 7.27.  It was felt that the patient was becoming volume
overloaded and would likely benefit from hemodialysis.

A discussion was had with the family about the possibility of
hemodialysis with regards to the patient's code status.  The
patient's family stated that they would need an additional
hour to make a decision on these matters.  During this time,
the patient had a large bowel movement and dropped his blood
pressure with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.  Shortly
thereafter the patient then coded.  At that time, the
patient's family stated that they would like the patient to
be DNR/DNI.  Thus, no further interventions were attempted.
The patient then passed away.
