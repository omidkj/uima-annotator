He reports generalized weakness for the last few days. 1 day
prior to admission, he got up to walk to bathroom and he fell.
No head trauma/LOC or pain. On the day of admission, he again
tried to get off the couch, after a few steps his "legs gave

.
In the ED, he was mildly hypoxic - 89%RA. A CXR was done with
question of pneumonia. He was given a dose of levofloxacin. The
final read of the CXR was of concern of [**Location (un) 22533**] Hump so a CTA
was done which was negative for PE and still with question of
PNA or atelectasis. He was also given aspirin and had 2 sets of
CEs checked for question of MI causing weakness. Prior to
leaving the ED, his BP dropped to 90/45 from 105/63.  He was
given an additional bolus of 1L NS.

posterolateral ribs, but no acute rib fracture.
3. No pulmonary embolism.
.
#CT head: PRELIM: atrophy; prior stroke in right frontal lobe;
no evidence of intrancranial hemorrhage or acute injury
.
#CT C-SPINE: PRELIM: spondylosis; no evidence of fx or
dislocation
.
Foot Xray: Two views. There is a comminuted fracture of the
distal shaft of the fifth metatarsal. There is moderate medial
angulation at the fracture site. Degenerative arthritic changes
are present, most pronounced at the first metatarsophalangeal
joint. There is a large plantar calcaneal spur. There is no
evidence of dislocation. Scattered atherosclerotic calcification
is present.
.
Hip Xray: AP PELVIS AND TWO VIEWS LEFT HIP: There is a
comminuted left intertrochanteric fracture with proximal
displacement and varus angulation. The femoral head approximates
well within the acetabulum. The right hip, bilateral sacroiliac
joints, and pubic symphysis are unremarkable. No additional
fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted left intertrocahnteric fracture as
described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male who presented after fracture of
the left femur after feeling weak for 2-3 days at home.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented on [**11-26**] with a fracture of the left femur
after falling while in the bathroom at home.  Imaging revealed a
femur fracture, no intracranial hemorrhage, no vertebral
fractures.  He had been taking coumadin for atrial fibrillation
and had an INR of 1.7 on admission, repeat was 2.2.  It was
noted that his hematocrit on admission was 39 and a follow up
hematocrit was 30.8.  There was concern that Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
bleeding from an unknown source and orthopedic surgery was held
until the patient was medically cleared.  A CXR done on
admission showed a possible PNA in the right upper lobe and the
patient was started on levaquin.  CT chest in the ED ruled out
PE and also raised suspicion for PNA.  CT head showed no bleed,
no acute process.
.
On [**11-27**] subsequent hematocrits were stable and it was felt that
the initial value was likely concentrated due to dehydration.
He was cleared for the OR on [**11-28**].  Of note, the night prior to
going to the OR, he triggered for a SBP of 89 and temperature to
101.9.  He was given a fluid bolus and his blood pressure
responded appropriately.  His antibiotics were not changed at
that time; he remained on levofloxacin.
.
He underwent ORIF of his L femur on [**2119-11-28**], receiving 2 units
of FFP and 2 units of PRBC and following extubation he was
brought to the PACU unresponsive.  He arrived in the PACU in
afib with rates in the 130s-140s.  The pt appeared to be having
difficulty with respiration and his ABG was 7.12/89/114 (unclear
how much FiO2).  He was given Lasix 20 mg IV and after pt was
noted to have repiratory distress; he was reintubated with
etomidate 14 mg and succinylcholine 120mcg.  Propofol was given
and pt was given Lopressor 3 mg IV.  His SBP decreased to the
80s, and he was given a 500 cc bolus with his SBP rising to the
low 100s. A L IJ cordis was placed with 4 mg IV morphine given
prior.  He also received Flagyl 500 mg IVx1 (in addition to the
Levaquin he was taking for PNA).  EKG revealed [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
