History of Present Illness:
 78 y.o. female with h/o CHF EF = 15-20%, active tobacco use,
0.5-1.5 ppd who presents with acute onset of shortness of breath
and black stool one day prior to admission.  She was in her

vomiting, or palpitations.  Denies NSAID use. She called her
PCP's office who checked labs and then advised her to go to the

.
SPEP: negative
UPEP: negative
.
EKG ([**2133-3-7**]): Atrial fibrillation @ 108. Intraventricular
conduction delay with left axis deviation which is probably
atypical left bundle-branch block. ST-T wave abnormalities may
be secondary to intraventricular conduction delay
.
Imaging:
CXR ([**2133-3-4**]): 1. Stable mild congestive heart failure.
2. Possible left small pleural effusion versus pleural
thickening.
.
Renal ultrasound ([**2133-3-5**]):
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. Slightly echogenic kidneys
consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.
2. Small amount of ascites.
.
Echocardiogram ([**2133-3-5**]):
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately
dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe
global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of
[**2132-9-1**], there has been no significant change.
.
CT head ([**2133-3-6**]): 1. Curvilinear hyperdensity bilaterally in
temporal horns of the ventricle, somewhat more prominent on the
left, probably representing calcified and prominent choroid,
given the absence of other abnormal density in the ventricle. In
this patient with anticoagulation, if the symptom persists or
worsens, please consider short-term followup by CT scan or MRI.
2. Sinusitis.
.
CXR: [**2133-3-7**]: IMPRESSION: Worsening patchy opacities at the lung
bases, most likely representing worsening atelectasis. Pneumonia
cannot be fully excluded
.
KUB ([**2133-3-7**]):
The air is identified throughout the small bowel and colon
probably indicating mild ileus. The pelvis is not completely
included in the radiograph. If clinically indicated, please
evaluate with repeated supine and erect AP radiographs of the
abdomen.
.
The patient has prior MVR and median sternotomy. Temporary pacer
wire is identified.
.
CXR ([**2133-3-10**]):
Tip of the right PIC catheter projects over the right
brachiocephalic vein at the level of the upper margin of the
manubrium. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube
passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Moderate
cardiomegaly stable. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is mild but
there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
Patient has had median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: 78 y.o. female with h/o gastric angioetasia, CHF with EF
= 15-20%, s/p MVR on coumadin p/w maroon red OGT output and
black stool with 10 point HCT drop and shortness of breath in
the setting of a supra-therapeutic INR. Pt was given FFP to
reverse coagulopathy. Initially given 4 units of blood with
increase in hct from 20 to 30. Most likely felt to be UGIB, with
initial ddx including AVM, ulcer, malignancy, gastritis. Pt was
intermittently hypotensive initially, so GI held off on EGD
given hypotension and risk of further BP drop with sedation. Pt
was then intubated for respiratory distress (see below). EGD was
performed on [**2133-3-9**] which showed gastric ulcer with evidence of
recent bleeding, clean based pyloric ulcer, and petechiae and
erosions in esophagus and stomach secondary to NG trauma. Most
likely source of bleeding is gastric ulcer. [**Hospital1 **] hct checks were
continued and pt was given an additional 2 units of blood for
slight drops in hct. Pt didn't have any further episodes of
bloody stool. Pt was initially maintained on IV bid protonix,
which was switched to po BID protonix after resolution of GIB.
Pt needs a repeat EGD in [**4-23**] weeks to document resolution of
gastric ulcer and for possible biopsy.
.
# DYSPNEA: On HD5 ([**3-8**]), pt was intubated secondary to
respiratory failure. Respiratory failure was felt to be likely
multifactorial [**12-18**]
