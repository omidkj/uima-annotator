HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9513**] is a 46-year-old
female with a history of asthma, diabetes, and hypertension
who was in her usual state of health until 2 a.m. this

abdominal pain, dysuria, cough, headache, or rashes.

In the Emergency Department, she received one aspirin,
nebulizers, Lopressor 5 mg intravenously times three (for
atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response), Lasix 40 mg
intravenously, and Levaquin 500 mg intravenously,
Solu-Medrol, Combivent nebulizers, and Atrovent nebulizers.
She diuresed greater than 1400 cc with a significant
improvement in her symptoms with improvement in her hypoxia
initially with PO2 levels in the 50s on room air and an
arterial blood gas of 7.49/39/39 to 95% to 100% on a 100%
nonrebreather.

alcohol.  No intravenous drug use.  She stays at home.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother deceased of cervical cancer.  Father
died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 67.  Sister
deceased from liver problems.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 98.2, blood pressure was 145/72,
heart rate was 122, respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen
saturation was 94% on 50% face mask.  In general, a pleasant
and obese middle-aged woman in no acute distress.  Spoke in
full sentences with no accessory muscle use.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
clear.  Neck examination revealed jugular venous distention
at 8 cm to 9 cm.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
distant, tachycardic, regular.  Normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  Within normal limits.  Pulmonary
examination revealed rales to two-thirds bilaterally.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and obese.
Normal active bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+.  No calf tenderness.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times
three; nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 16.1 (with differential
demonstrating 94 neutrophils, 2 lymphocytes, and 2
monocytes), hematocrit was 44.4, and platelets were 313.
Coagulations were within normal limits.  Chemistry-7 was
within normal limits other than hypokalemia to 2.4.  Creatine
kinase was 312, with a MB of 7, and troponin was 0.7.
Urinalysis revealed trace protein.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed
pulmonary edema; right greater than left, and cardiomegaly.

Electrocardiogram revealed atrial flutter at 142.  ST
depressions in V4 through V6 which resolved on later
electrocardiograms with rate control.  Poor R wave
progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Ischemia:  The patient ruled
out for a myocardial infarction.  The source for her
congestive heart failure exacerbation with negative cardiac
enzymes.  Of note, though, the patient did have a slight
troponin leak as high as 0.9.

She was continued on aspirin and a beta blocker while
hospitalized and should follow up with her primary care
physician with an outpatient stress test.

(b)  Pump:  In terms of pump, the patient presented with an
acute congestive heart failure exacerbation; likely
precipitated by severe hypertension and atrial flutter.

She was heavily diuresed on her first two days of admission
with significant improvement in her pulmonary examination and
oxygenation.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated
severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with the septum of greater
than 2 cm.  Her medical regimen was tailored to this finding
with the addition of aggressive rate control with metoprolol
50 mg p.o. twice per day.  She was tried on verapamil;
however, she was unable to tolerate secondary to hypotension.

Further blood pressure control was achieved with lisinopril
20 mg p.o. once per day.  She may need a further increase of
her ACE inhibitor and was to be closely followed by her
outpatient primary care physician as well as cardiologist.

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient maintained a normal sinus rhythm
after spontaneously converting from atrial flutter.  Her
arrhythmia did not repeat in the next four days of her
hospitalization.  She may need continued evaluation of this
with an outpatient Holter monitor; as determined by her
cardiologist and primary care physician.

2.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient's oxygenation improved
with diuresis; however, she was relatively hypoxic in her
first two days despite diuresis.  She also had a temperature
spike and a chest x-ray which could have represented an
atypical pneumonia.  She was started on treatment with
azithromycin and ceftriaxone with an appropriate response in
her temperature and oxygenation.  She was to continue
azithromycin and was to complete a 5-day course and
cefpodoxime and was to complete a 14-day course.  She was
also maintained on occasional nebulizer treatments for her
asthma and was to continue outpatient inhaler treatment.

3.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient developed
frequency, burning, and urgency on the two days prior to
discharge after Foley catheter removal; for which she was
treated with cefpodoxime and azithromycin (as above) as well
as Pyridium for symptomatic relief.  Culture results were
pending at the time of discharge.

4.  PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on her
outpatient psychiatric regimen including trazodone and Paxil.
She was to continue to follow up with her primary care
physician.

INTERVENTIONS PERFORMED:
1.  A Swan-Ganz catheter placement.
2.  Echocardiogram.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with [**Hospital6 3429**] services to assist with compliance.
