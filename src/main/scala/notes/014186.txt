Chief Complaint:
rectal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy with banding of bleeding ulcer


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 yo M with h/o large recto-sigmoid polyp, s/p recent
colonoscopy on [**7-6**] with multiple polyps identified s/p
polypectomy who presents with 2 episodes BRBPR today.  Patient
has felt otherwise well post colonoscopy.  This morning, he had
2 bloody BMs with clot, as well as gell-like stool.  He denies
nausea, bloody emesis, or black stool (he takes iron).
Otherwise denies any change in his bowel habits, abdominal pain,
CP or SOB.  He did feel slightly lightheaded after having these
episodes.  He has not had issues with bleeding in the past and
notes no change in bruisability or excessive bleeding.  He
presented to an OSH with a Hct 28.  Because he received his
colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**], he was transferred for further evaluation.
 Of note, he was scheduled to have repeat colonoscopy in 3
months given concern for APC.  Also of note, he was scheduled to
have recent pacemaker placement.
.
In the ED, Hct 29.  AVSS.  NG lavage negative.  Transfusion was
not given due to his stable Hct.  He was evaluated by GI who
wishes to repeat his colonoscopy.

STUDIES:

EKG: LBBB at 79bpm with occational PVCs.  No change compared to

Colonoscopy ([**7-21**])
Findings:
 Contents: Large amount of fresh red blood and clots were seen
in the transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon,
sigmoid colon and rectum. There was a small amount of dark
liquid content in the ascending colon and cecum which was
completely suctioned.
 Excavated Lesions A single ulcer was found in the cecum at the
old polypectomy site which had a clean base. It was flushed with
water and no active bleeding source was identified.
A small ulcer was found in the splenic flexure at the old
polypectomy site without active bleeding.
 Careful visulization of the colon was performed after
flushing/suctioning with water during withdrawl of the
colonoscope.
A small ulcer with visible vessel was noted at 18cm from anal
verge the site of the large EMR. Active bleeding was noted from
this site. Five endoclips were applied for the purpose of
hemostasis at the base of this bleeding site at 18cm. 10 cc. of
total epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injection were applied for hemostasis
at the base of the polypectomy site with good hemostasis at the
end of the procedure. The area was flushed with water and no
further active bleeding was seen.
.
Impression: Active bleeding was noted from ulcer with visible
vessel at polypectomy site at 18 cm from anal verge.  Hemostasis
was achieved using endoclips and epinephrine.

Brief Hospital Course:
72M with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM2 who presents with BRBPR after
recent colonoscopy with multi-polypectomies, Hct stablized with
no further episodes of bleeding.
.
# GI bleeding:
Red blood per rectum most consistent with a lower source, and
his recent polypectomy would predispose to bleeding -- however,
it has been ~2 weeks since the procedure. He received 3 units of
pRBCs, 1 unit of DDAVP, 1 unit FFP and oral vitamin K for INR
1.6 and hematocrit drop 28.6 to 24.2.  Patient had a colonoscopy
here that noted active bleeding from an ulcer with visible
vessel at polypectomy site at 18 cm from anal verge. Hemostasis
was achieved using endoclips and epinephrine.  His hematocrit
was stable for 72 hours after the colonoscopy without the need
for any further transfusions.  He was transferred to the floor
where his hematocrit remained stable.  He was advanced to a
regular diet which he tolerated without difficulty.
.
On the day of discharge, [**7-24**], he was instructed to restart his
aspirin in 7 days.  He will follow-up with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] [**6-10**]
days to have his CBC checked.  He will need to have repeat
colonoscopy within 2-3 months, which will be arranged by the GI
service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Pt was provided with his phone number
in case he does not receive notification.  He was instructed to
continue colace, senna, and miralax prn for constipation while
on iron.
.
# CAD s/p CABG: stable, EKG unchanged.  In the ICU, patient's
ASA and beta blocker were held in the setting of bleeding.  Once
hemodynamically stable, the beta blocker was restarted.  His
aspirin should be restarted 7 days after his discharge as per
GI.
.
# Chronic Systolic CHF: On admission to the ICU, patient
appeared euvolemic.  Beta blockers, statin, diuretics, digoxin
and ASA were initially held in the setting of bleeding.  Signs
of volume overload were monitored given added volume from blood
