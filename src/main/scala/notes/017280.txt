Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
rectal bleeding/hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Catheter Placement


History of Present Illness:
the patient is a 79-year-old woman with complicated medical
history including systolic CHF (EF 15-20%), asthma, type II
diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, who now presents with
hypotension, weakness, and red blood in her diaper, in the
setting of [**2-3**] days of black stools, per report. Also with
reported temperature of 101.1. Per her daughter, on the day
prior to admission patient became increasingly tired and had a
home blood pressure measurement "in the 60s." At this time, she
refused to come to the emergency room. However, the following
morning, when she was increasingly lethargic, her family
insisted on bringing her to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, her initial vital signs were: T:98.3, P:100,
BP:91/38, R:26, O2 sat:100% 10L NRB. Lung exam was notable for
bibasilar crackles. Extremities were warm, without edema.
Patient was noted to have brown guiaic positive stool in her
rectal vault. Her abdomen was soft. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with no ischemic changes. Labs showed a hematocrit
of 24.4, near her baseline in the mid to high 20s. White blood
cell count was 10.5 (near her previous baseline), with 80% polys
and no bands. Electrolytes showed a creatinine of 2.0 (up from
previous 1.2-1.3), with bicarbonate of 20 and sodium of 128.
Urinalysis showed moderate leuks, neg nitrites, with many
bacteria, 21-50 whites and 0-2 epis. Lactate was 1.7. Blood and
urine cultures were drawn, and patient was given IV
pantoprazole, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl in addition to 3L of
intravenous saline and 2u of PRBCs. A IJ central line was placed
due to persistent hypotension to 80s in the ED. She was started
on Levophed drip.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to the CCU service
[**Date range (1) 35488**] for dyspnea and somnolence. Altered mental status was
attributed to hyponatremia to 118, after ruling out intracranial
processes and pan-hypopituitarism. Dyspnea was attributed to
decompensated heart failure, with TTE revealing EF of 15-20% and
cardiac catheterization showing no new ischemic disease. Towards
the end of the admission, the patient was noted to have guaiac
positive stools, including an episode of melena one day prior to
discharge. Per discharge summary, the GI recommendations were
for patient to undergo outpatient workup for source of bleed, as
the patient's stools had returned to brown color, and hct was
stable. This is not documented in the ED.
.
Changes to her [**Date range (1) 4982**], per the recent discharge summary,
include stopping fexofenadine, amitriptyline, atenolol, and
paroxetine and starting simvastatin, baby aspirin, metoprolol,
and immodium. Levothyroxine was increased and vitamin D added.
Discharge dose of Lasix was 40 mg once daily.
.
Review of systems: currently, patient feels tired and weak. She
denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
79-year-old woman with many medical problems recently discharged
from the hospital for CHF exacerbation and readmitted with
hypotension, fever, positive UA, diarrhea and guiaic positive
brown stools.
.
# Hypotension: Caused by UTI (urosepsis) and possible GI bleed.
Patient started on ciprofloxacin for Klebsiella UTI and will be
treated for 14 day course. Hemocrit was stable so GI bleed was
less likely. Anti-hypertensives were held initially given
hypotension and then were slowly restarted. At discharge,
patient was on home dose of metoprolol and lisinopril. Lasix was
reduced to 20mg. Patient should be followed up as an outpatient
for further titration of BP meds
.
#Gastrointestinal bleed: Guaiac paositive stools on admission.
Prior admission included guaiac positive stools. GI had seen
patient on last visit and plan was made to follow up with GI as
outpatient. No other interventions were necessary. Hct was
stable throughout admission.
 .
# Systolic congestive heart failure: Euvolemic on transfer to
floor. Given hypotension lasix was held and restarted at 20mg on
discharge. Daily weights should be recorded and titration of
lasix should occur as
