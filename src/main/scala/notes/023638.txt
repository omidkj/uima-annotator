Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
69yo woman with h/o aspiration and COPD presenting with an
episode of respiratory distress at home.  She had J tube removed
on [**2193-11-27**] and has deteriorated since this time.  She had the J
tube for 4 years and was taking tube feeds and supplementing
with oral intake.  She wanted the J tube removed for quality of
life and this was done on [**2193-11-27**].  Since this time, anything
she would eat or drink would come out the J-tube hole onto the
skin.  She has had constant leakage of green fluid onto the
abdomen, leading to erythema and pain. She complained of
generalized abdominal pain.  On [**2193-12-4**] she was seen in the [**Hospital **]
clinic for a complaint of pain and the notes indicate the site
was healing, though slightly erythematous.  Her caretaker notes
the onset of significant weakness over the last few weeks since
the J tube was removed and her oral intake became unreliable and
the leakage continued.  She usually is able to cough if she
aspirates and does the incentive spirometer reliably.  Over the
last 2 weeks, she has not been able to do this.
.
This morning, she was given an enema because she had not had a
bowel movement in the last week.  She did not eat breakfast, but
was noted to have ronchorous upper airway sounds consistent with
her prior history of aspiration.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:   97.3    138/62    100   30  84-95%
on 4L NC.  She had a WBC of 20 with 20% bands and new ARF.  She
had a high oxygen requirement in the ED, satting mid-80s on 100%
NRB.  Respiratory deep suctioned her and produced a significant
amount of grey/green foul sputum. This was sent for culture.
Her oxygen saturation stabilized and mental status improved once
this was done.  She had a rectal temperature done, which was 99
degrees.  She was given 1600 cc IV fluids.  CXR demonstrated an
infiltrate and she was treated for aspiration pneumonia with
levofloxacin 750 mg X 1, ceftriaxone 1 g IV X 1 and clindamycin
600 mg IV X 1.  CT Torso revealed acute on chronic aspiration
and possible pancreatitis. Her lipase returned elevated.

Given her variable oxygen requirement, she was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to the floor, she
complains of being thirsty and of abdominal pain.  She is awake
and answers questions, but sometimes makes nonsensical comments.
Her caretaker arrived and reported that her the current state is
her most recent baseline.  Prior to the J tube removal, she was
mobile with a rolling walker, conversant and not confused.  The
patient [**Hospital Unit Name **] headache, blurred vision, mouth sores, chest pain
or leg pain. She has some shortness of breath.

CXR [**2193-12-13**]:
New infiltrate in the left perihilar and left lower lobe in the
presence of a chronic elevated left hemidiaphragm. The findings
are most
compatible with pneumonia. Repeat radiography to document
resolution after
appropriate therapy recommended.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2193-12-13**]:
1. Acute on chronic aspiration in both lung bases, right greater
than left, which is worse compared to CT from 12/[**2191**]. Small
left pleural effusion.
2. Faint fat stranding around the pancreas. Please correlate
clinically for possible pancreatitis.
.
RUQ Ultrasound [**2193-12-14**]:
Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation and dilatation of the common bile duct
up to 1 cm. The gallbladder is distended with a large shadowing
stone measuring 1.7 cm in the dependent portion. However, there
is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The
main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. Evaluation of
the pancreas was not possible due to overlying bowel gas and
ostomy bag.
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2. Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, not
significantly
changed compared to the recent CT.If there is concern for
choledocholithiasis, ERCP may be performed for further
evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old female with multiple medical problems presented with
respiratory distress from aspiration event in setting of
persistent J tube leakage and abdominal pain.  Imaging studies
supported clinical exam of acute on chronic aspiration. Her
respiratory status improved post deep suction by respiratory
therapy. She was treated for aspiration pneumonia with IV
levofloxacin and flagyl starting [**12-13**] and throughout her
hospitalization completing a 7 day course of antibiotic therapy.
 Goals of care were discussed at length with the patient and her
health care proxy. The decision was made to allow the patient to
eat and drink as she wished with the knowledge that she will
continue to aspirate and ultimately experience infection,
respiratory distress and death. Patient showed clear
understanding and accepted these risks. Patient requested that
she not be hospitalized if she were to develop symptoms of
respiratory distress or pneumonia after her discharge. She was
offered Hospice services to help with symptom management should
she not wish to return to the hospital.  Patient will be
evaluated by [**Hospital **] home health services bridged to Hospice.
Her respiratory symptoms remained stable after intitial
presentation to the floor. She continued to experience regular
asymptomatic oxygen desaturations with eating. Patient will be
discharged home on continuous supplemental oxygen.
.
Surgery was consulted regarding her gastrocutaneous fistula.
They presented the options of sclerotherapy, laproscopic
surgery, or replacing the G-tube.  Patient chose to replace the
G-tube to stop the leaking. She does not want to rely on the
g-tube for feedings. However, she is concerned that eating has
become "too much work".  She would like to have the option of
using the tube for medications and nutrition if needed for
comfort.  G-tube was placed (re
