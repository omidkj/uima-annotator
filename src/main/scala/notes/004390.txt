Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo F with h/o AML w/ neutropenia and fever, with
hypotension and pancytopenia.
.
1. Febrile Neutropenia - In the ED patient was hypotensive and
started on dopamine. Patient was off pressors (Dopamine) after
transfer from the ICU and blood pressure was stable throughout
the stay. Blood cx taken on the bmt service were negative,
multiple CXR showed no PNA. Initially, patient's hypotension was
thought to be from ativan overdose at home vs. sepsis.
Patient was treated emperically with cefepime 2g IV q24h d1 =
[**2144-3-2**].  Patient was additionally started on vanco emperically
for a fever of 100.4 on [**3-10**]. Subsequently patient was then
started on caspo for persistent fevers. MRI of abdomen neg for
source of fevers.
A source of infection was never found so the initial hypotension
and change in mental status were both thought to be from ativan
overdose rather than sepsis.

2. Pancytopenia - Most likely [**1-22**] recent chemotherapy.
patient is transfused in house 2x and was determined to be
transfusion dependent due to her disease.  She had a port placed
to help with chronic transfusions and blood draws. She remained
transfusion dependent.

3. MS changes - Mental status much clearer after first two
nights. However, family stated that patient's MS had been
deteriorating for past weeks/months.
- acute MS changes at admission were most likely due to ativan
overdose at home.  After transfer from the unit patient became
very lucid just short term memory problems. [**Name (NI) 430**] MRI was
negative except for sinus disease thought to be chronic. The
patient then developed left facial droop and slurring of speech.
A head CT was notable for possible new infarct in the right
corona radiata. The patients neurological deficits worsened and
she was made CMO.

.
4. AML - pt is currently recieving azacytidine therapy, which
has resulted in her pancytopenia. danazol was d/c'd in house and
no further therapy was instituted.
.
5. ARF - resolved Cre back to baseline. At admission pt most
likely had prerenal azotemia that resolved with fluids.
.
6. Code - was DNR/DNI during this hospitalization as discussed
w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**]. She was made CMO after her right corona radiata
stroke. A morphine gtt was started for respiratory discomfort.
She passed away on [**2144-3-27**].
