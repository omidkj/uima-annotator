Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levaquin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 86 year-old male multiple medical problems who
presents with hypoglycemia since last night. The patient was
admitted to the hospital from [**Date range (1) 68760**] wtih hypoglycemia. He
was evaluated by endocrinology at that time and the most likely
etiology of his hypoglycemia was felt to be pre-diabetes causing
hyperinsulinemia. Work-up revealed an elevated C-peptide (18.1),
elevated insulin level of 41, negative sulfonylurea screen, and
low beta-hydroxybutyrate. These labs had all been pending at the
time of discharge. He was discharged home with instructions to
eat frequent small meals (to prevent hyperinsulinemia), follow
fasting and post-prandial fingersticks, and follow-up with his
[**Date range (1) 3390**] and endocrinology. Family has been checking FS multiple
times daily, mostly ranging 80-150's. Reportedly had a similar
episode at some point in the '90s.
.
Pt had been feeling in his usual state of health until several
days ago when he developed cough, low-grade fevers (to 38
degrees celsius over the weekend, more recently normal) and
dyspnea with ambulation. He was seen by his [**Date range (1) 3390**] yesterday and
was found to have rales at the R mid and lower lung fields,
afebrile, breathing comfortably. He was started on levoquin for
empiric CAP coverage. PA and lateral CXR was negative for
pneumonia.
.
Last night around 10pm he became tremulous and diaphoretic. FS
was noted to be in the 40s. His family gave him juice and honey.
At 2am, he had a similar episode with tremors, FS in the 40s,
and again received juice and honey. He slept well until 8am when
he had a third episode. At this point, they called EMS. On
arrival, FS was 48. He was given an amp of D50 and his FS
improved to 180. Family declined having him brought to the ED.
Less than one hour later, his FS again dropped to the 40s. At
this point, EMS was called again and he was brought to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.7, BP 145/115, HR 70, RR12,
100% on RA. Mental status was at baseline. Exam notable for
left-sided rhonchi. CXR was clear. UA negative. No leukocytosis.
Given levofloxacin. FS on arrival was 49 and he received 1 amp
D50. FS dropped again to 40s within an hour, symptomatic with
tremors, and he was given another amp of D50. Started D5 drip
and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close FS monitoring.

CXR:[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   86 year old man with h/o chf but now with recent fevers,
cough, rales right
   lung fields
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   r/o pneumonia
Final Report
INDICATION: 86-year-old man with history of CHF, now with recent
fevers,
cough, rales in the right lung field. Rule out pneumonia.

COMPARISON: Multiple chest radiographs, most recent on [**12-2**], [**2164**].

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral views of the chest.

FINDINGS: Left-sided pacer leads are intact and terminate in the
expected
location in the right atrium and ventricle, unchanged. Midline
sternotomy
wires are again noted with a small fracture in the third wire,
which is
unchanged since [**2159**].

Vascular engorgement has improved since the prior study. The
lungs appear
clear with no evidence of pneumonia. Cardiomegaly is stable. The
aorta is
calcified and slightly tortuous.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. Improved vascular
engorgement since
prior study.
.
Renal Ultrasound:
NDINGS: This study is limited by patient body habitus and
limited ability
to cooperate with the exam. The left kidney measures 9.9 cm and
the right
kidney measures 9.1 cm. There is no nephrolithiasis or
hydronephrosis in
either kidney. There is a simple cyst arising from the mid pole
of the left
kidney.

The bladder is obscured by shadowing from the air within the
urinary bladder,
likely due to air of Foley catheter placement.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study. No hydronephrosis.

2. Non-visualization of the bladder due to air within the
bladder. If
further evaluation is required, consider alternative imaging
methods (MR) or
cystoscopy.
 .
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2165-12-23**]:
NDICATION: Dementia, hematuria and anticoagulation with drop in
hematocrit.
Please evaluate for retroperitoneal bleed.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen [**2161-9-17**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the
lung bases to
the symphysis without contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images
were obtained
and reviewed.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural
effusions with
associated passive atelectasis. Evaluation of the lung
parenchyma is limited
given respiratory motion. No large mass is detected. Pacer wires
are
detected within the right ventricle and right atrium. There is
CT evidence of
anemia. No pericardial effusion is present.

Evaluation of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic parenchymal organs
is limited
given lack of IV contrast administration. However, no focal mass
lesion is
identified within the liver. Tiny hypoattenuating lesions within
the liver
are too small to adequately characterize. The spleen, stomach
and pancreas
appear grossly unremarkable. There is calcification of the
abdominal aorta
and iliac branches with a small ectasia of the infrarenal aorta
measuring
maximum diameter of 2.3 cm. There is atrophy of the right kidney
with respect
to the left. A probable AML is again noted within the interpolar
region of
the left kidney. There is a splenule within the splenic hilum.
Dense
calcified at
