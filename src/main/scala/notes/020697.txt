Chief Complaint:
Reason for admission: Hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74557**] is an 83yo male with PMH significant for HTN and
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] s/p mechanical fall which
resulted in SAH and subdural hematoma. He now presents with
elevated blood pressures ~200's at rehab facility. Per records
[**Hospital 74558**] rehab, he has had 2 episodes of elevated BPs that have
been difficult to control with oral regimen. BP early this AM
was 226/90 and did not come down with Labetolol 200mg x1,
Nitropaste, and Hydralazine. Given this he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up. Patient denies any vision changes,
headaches, or abdominal pain.
.
In the ED his initial vitals were T 97.8 BP 162/75 AR 70 RR 14
O2 sat 96% RA. He received Hydralazine 10mg IV, Labetolol 10mg
x2, Labetolol 20mg IV, and was then started on Nipride gtt.
.
Of note, patient recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-11**] s/p
mechanical fall which resulted in SDH and subdural hematoma. No
surgical intervention was done at the time as the bleed was
cnsidered stable and no urgent intervention was warranted.

Past Medical History:
1)Type 2 DM
2)SAH, subdural hematoma, and R temporal fracture secondary to
mechanical fall on [**2197-10-5**], recently discharged on [**2197-10-11**] (no
neurosurgery intervention; only placed on dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis)
3)Hypertension
4)BPH

Social History:
Prior to fall very active and worked 3d/week designing medical
equipment. No history of tobacco, alcohol, or IVDA.

Family History:
noncontributory

IMAGING:
[**10-15**] CT Head:
Overall unchanged appearance of hemorrhagic contusions in
bilateral frontal lobes, with subdural, subarachnoid and
intraventricular hemorrhage which has been slightly decreased.
Redemonstration of opacified right mastoid air cells, likely
inflammatory in origin. Small high density area within the left
subdural collection can represent residual hemorrhage
versus recurrent hemorrhage since eight days ago.
.
[**10-18**] CXR:
Dual-obscuration of the left diaphragmatic pleural surface may
represent
either obliteration by consolidation in the adjacent left lower
lobe or
small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  Small right pleural
effusion is new. Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size normal.
.
[**10-30**] CXR:
1.  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation.
2.  New right basilar atelectasis.
.
[**11-2**] CXR:
Progressive decrease in opacification at the right base
consistent with clearing of the previously noted pneumonia.
.
[**10-27**] Renal US:
Mildly elevated resistive indices and tardus parvus
configuration
bilaterally, but no evidence of hemodynamically significant
renal artery
stenosis in right or left kidneys
.
[**10-23**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size and regional/global systolic function
are normal (LVEF >55%) Right  ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is  moderately dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or  vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is
no aortic valve stenosis.  An eccentric jet of mild to moderate
([**2-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen  directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
 systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2197-10-7**], the findings are  similar.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) HYPERTENSION:
-- On the day of admission, the patient found to have elevated
SBPs~200's at rehab facility. He has history of difficult to
control BPs per recent discharge summary. No signs or symptoms
of end organ ischemia/damage were noted on admission. Patient
was initially started on Nitroprusside gtt in ED and responded
appropriately with better control of his BPs.  When he arrived
to the ICU, the Nitroprusside drip was stopped and he was
transitioned to oral medications.  He was restarted on
hydralazine 25mg PO q 6hr, his Labetolol was increased to 600mg
PO TID and his was restarted on Amlodipine 5 mg.  His blood
pressures were noted to be lower than goal.  Labetalol was
decreased to 400TID and hydralazine was stopped.
-- While on the floor, his regimen was optimized and his
pressures were well controlled.  He is now on labetolol 600 mg
Q8 hours and amlodipine Q12 hours.  He has not needed any IV
medications in over four days, and he his pressures have been
runnng 120 - 150's.
-- Goal BP is 120 - 160.  Due to his recent head bleeds, he
becomes encephalopathic at lower pressures and at pressures >
200.
.
#) MENTAL STATUS + SDH/SAH:
-- Repeat head CT on admission showed no change in the SAH/SDH
from the end of [**Month (only) 216**].
-- He has had waxing and [
