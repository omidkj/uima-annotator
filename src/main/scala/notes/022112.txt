Service:  CCU MEDICINE

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Anterior ST elevation myocardial
infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 74-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease status post two left
anterior descending artery Cypher stents in [**2101-8-17**] after a
positive stress test.  She had an uncomplicated
postcatheterization course and was discharged to home.  While
at home, she apparently suffered from nausea and vomiting,
which she had attributed to the Plavix, which she was started
on while in the hospital.  She self discontinued the Plavix,
and on the day of admission, had an episode of chest pain
which radiated to her jaw associated with nausea and
vomiting.  Once the paramedics arrived, she was found to have
VF arrest, and was shocked several times and started on a
lidocaine drip and amiodarone.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], she remained hypotensive, and was
started on dopamine, Levophed, Heparin, Integrilin, and given
300 mg of clopidogrel via nasogastric tube.  She was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Cath Laboratory.  She was found to have anterior ST
elevations, and was taken to the Cath Laboratory.  In the
Catheterization Laboratory, she had a rheolytic thrombectomy
of left anterior descending artery lesion with placement of
2.5 x 18 Hepakote stent.  She also had intra-aortic balloon
pump placed, started on dopamine and a temporary pacemaker
wire was placed due to RBBB, left axis on EKG.  She was
subsequently transferred to the CCU in stable condition.
While in the CCU, she had an episode of coffee-ground emesis.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Magnesium was 1.1, CK

EKG:  Sinus rhythm at 98 beats per minute, first degree A-V
block, LAD, right bundle branch block, Q in V1 through V3.

Last cardiac catheterization in [**2101-8-17**] showed one vessel
coronary artery disease, normal left ventricular systolic
function, mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction,
successful Cypher stenting of two left anterior descending
artery lesions.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac:  Ischemia wise, patient is status post stent
placement of anterior ST MI and was on intra-aortic balloon
pump for augmented diastole.  Patient's intra-aortic balloon
pump was removed on [**2101-8-31**] without any problems, and
patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix, statin, and
Integrilin.  However, patient's Integrilin was stopped 18
hours after catheterization placement, and patient's aspirin
was continued.

Patient was successfully weaned off all pressors.  Patient's
cardiac medications were adjusted this hospitalization to
maximize her cardiac function.  Patient was continued on
aspirin, statin, and Plavix.  Patient was also continued on a
low dose beta blocker to control her heart rate.
Additionally, the patient was continued on ACE inhibitor,
captopril during hospitalization, however, was changed to
lisinopril 10 q.d. on discharge.  Patient was also started on
digoxin during this hospitalization to increase her
contractility.  Digoxin level the day before discharge was
1.5.  Digoxin level will need to be rechecked.  Patient was
also started on p.o. Lasix at 20 q.d.

Patient's ejection fraction remained 25-30% with inferior
akinesis and dyskinetic apex.  Patient's Coumadin was held
for a few days during this hospitalization for
supertherapeutic INRs.  However, Coumadin was restarted on
day before discharge, and will need to be followed frequent
INRs.  Patient remained regular rhythm 48 hours before
discharge.  Patient is therefore status post anterior MI,
status post cardiogenic shock, which has now all resolved and
tachycardia was likely secondary to ....................<
changes for decreased cardiac output.

2. Pulmonary wise, the patient has a history of lung cancer
status post lobectomy.  Patient has stable saturations after
extubation on admission.  Patient's ABGs continued to remain
stable and sats continue to remain stable.  Patient was
started on levofloxacin for COPD prophylaxis and will need to
complete another two day course of levofloxacin.

3. Clostridium difficile positive:  Patient was found to be
Clostridium difficile positive a few days after admission.
Patient was started on p.o. Flagyl and will need to continue
a 10 day course of Flagyl.  Patient was day #4 on discharge.
Patient's diarrhea, however, began to resolve on discharge.

4. Heme:  Patient's hematocrit was stable with a goal
hematocrit above 30.

5. FEN:  Patient was started on sugar free shakes and ice
cream on day of discharge.  Patient was also continued on a
multivitamin.  It is vital for patient to encourage good p.o.
intake as it will help her recover.

6. ENT:  Patient had epistaxis and had a balloon placed for five
days during this hospitalization. Patient was covered with Keflex
for TSS prophylaxis during this time period.  Patient, however,
is since stable and has had no issues with this over 72 hours
before discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient will be discharged to rehab per PT
recommendations.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction with
cardiogenic shock.
2. Right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block
which is now resolved.
3. Instent thrombosis status post new stent placement.
4. Clostridium difficile positive.
