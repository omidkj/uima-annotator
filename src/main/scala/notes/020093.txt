EGD/Colonscopy


History of Present Illness:
73 yo female with hx of recent admission for R hip
fracture/pinning with period of hypoxia during the previous
admission, now presents from rehab with unresponsiveness,
refusal to take meds, hypoxia. In the ED, her triage vitals were
T96F, HR 106, BP 124/91, RR 14, Sat 90%. CTA showed bilateral
pulmonary emboli. Vascular surgery was consulted via the ED, and
considering pt developed PE despite outpt prophylaxis doses of
Lovenox, an IVC filter was placed, and the patient was started
on heparin drip. She was admitted to Medicine for ongoing
management. On evaluation on the floor, she is a poor historian
and reports that she is in the hospital because she was not
treated well at rehab. She does recall (with prompting) being
told that there are clots in her lungs and that she had a
procedure before coming to the floor. Multiple attempts to
contact her daughter were made, but her phone was busy.
.
ROS: She reports mild difficulty breathing and pain at the site
of her recent surgery (right hip), as well as lower extremity
swelling. She denies fevers, chills, night sweats, visual
changes, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, cough, urinary frequency, dysuria, and
constipation.

Past Medical History:
Seizure disorder (developed [**1-13**] DKA in [**2095**])
breast CA s/p mastectomy with prosthetic reconstruction ([**2107**])
IDDM
RA
HTN
glaucoma
bilat TKRs
.
Of note, neuropsych evaluation in [**2125**] commented that "her
marked attentional impairments raises concerns around her
safety, medication compliance, and other areas of functional
vulnerability."


Social History:
Social History: Lived alone prior to recent hospitalization.
Ambulatory at baseline (with cane).
- Tobacco: none
- Alcohol: none
- Illicits: none

Family History:
Family History: mother died at 47 in surgery (possibly during a
hysterectomy). No information was available to her regarding her
birth father. She has several step siblings. Her daughter is
healthy.

Pertinent Results:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lobar and segmental PE, without evidence of right
heart strain.
2. Pulmonary edema with evolving infarcts. Close imaging
followup is
recommended.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: No acute changes.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS IMPRESSION: Clot within the left posterior
tibial vein. Otherwise, normal study.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST: HISTORY: Known bilateral PEs with
16-point hematocrit drop after initiating heparin. Evaluate for
bleeding.
IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacity
with septal
thickening, unchanged.
3. Subcentimeter liver hypodensities, too small to characterize.

4. Gastric diverticulum.
5. Bilateral renal hypodensities, some of which are too small to

characterize, others of which may represent simple cysts.
6. Left adrenal gland thickening.
7. IVC filter placement.
8. Fibroid uterus.

9. Slight asymmetrical enlargement of the right anterior thigh
musculature
with vague hyperdensity which may suggest small amount of
intramuscular
bleeding.
10. Diffuse anasarca.

CT Pelvis [**2128-3-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1. No findings to explain
hematocrit decrease. 2. Diffuse anasarca.

Chest PA/Lat [**2128-3-9**]: The current study demonstrates the left
PICC line tip being located at the junction of the left
brachiocephalic vein and SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
relatively stable. Widespread parenchymal opacities are present
but improved since the prior study. Subpleural interstitial
changes are noted and are most likely consistent with chronic
interstitial changes rather than acute infection, and as was
mentioned, improved compared to the prior images.  No focal
consolidations to suggest new infection are currently
demonstrated, but given the two-week interval compared to the
prior imaging, cannot be entirely excluded. No increase in
pleural effusion is demonstrated. No substantial evidence for
failure is seen.

Hip X-ray [**2128-3-8**]: IMPRESSION: Fixation of right femoral
subcapital fracture with unchanged alignment.


Brief Hospital Course:
73yF with history of rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, recent
right hip fracture s/p ORIF and presumed NSTEMI during
hospitalization, presented with altered mental status and
hypoxia from rehab, found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism,
possible pneumonia, and a UTI. Hospitalization was complicated
by recurrent drops in her hematocrit, initially thought to be
[**1-13**] to hemolysis, but was subsequently noted to have an upper GI
bleed [**1-13**] to a large duodenal ulcer.

An IVC filter was placed via Vascular Surgery consult from the
ED, she was started on heparin gtt and antibiotics (Vanc, CTX,
levo), and she was admitted to the Hospitalist service for
ongoing care.  Following admission, she was found to have a very
rapid HCT drop of unclear source (16 points within 11 hours).
Her heparin wa
