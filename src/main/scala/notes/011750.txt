[**2151-7-29**] Head Ct :
1. Large left inferior temporal and frontal contusions along

subdural, left subarachnoid and cerebellar subarachnoid
hemorrhages as
mentioned above. Possible right cerebellar contusion.
2. Intraventricular layering hemorrhage without hydrocephalus.
3. Right arachnoid cyst with layering intralesional hemorrhage.

4. Left retrobulbar hematoma, which appears to be extraconal.
Status post
lateral canthotomy.
5. Right occipital fracture extending to skull base and separate
minimally
displaced left orbital roof fracture.

[**2151-7-29**] CT Torso :
1. Right anterior fourth through seventh and posterior fourth
through ninth rib fractures are seen.
2. Large hiatal hernia with resultant atelectasis.
3. ET tube in right main stem, beyond the carina by 2cm. This
was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**2169**] on [**2151-7-29**].

[**2151-7-30**] Head CT :
1. Overall stable appearance to multifocal areas of hemorrhage
including
within a right frontal arachnoid cyst, left intraparenchymal
frontal and
parietal contusions and subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left
convexity.
Additional subdural hematomas along the tentorium, midline falx
and left
posterior convexity are unchanged.
2. No new areas of hemorrhage

[**2151-7-30**] CT Mandible :
1. Minimally displaced superior orbital roof fracture with
underlying
extraconal hematoma. No evidence for intracranial air.
2. Nondisplaced fracture through the right occipital condyle
extending into the skull base.
3. Mild sinus opacification which may relate to patient's
intubated status.

[**2151-7-31**] Head CT :
1. Overall stable appearance to multifocal areas of intracranial
hemorrhage.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
2. Stable soft tissue swelling along the lateral aspect of the
left orbit

[**2151-8-2**] Cardiac Echo :
Normal left ventricular cavity size with akinesis of the distal
half with aneurysm c/w Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (cannot fully
exclude mid-LAD lestion, but given the symmetry of the
dysfunction, is less likely). Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Increased PCWP.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency
Room and intubated as her mental status was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
She was evaluated by Neurosurgery, Plastic Surgery and Opt
homology additionally.  After her scans were reviewed she was
admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management.

The Neurosurgery service recommended following her neuro exam
along with Head CT's and on 3 consecutive CT's she had a stable
appearance of her IPH and SAH and no significant edema.  She had
no seizure activity but was prophylactically placed on Dilantin
for 7 days.  Her neuro exam was difficult as she was sedated and
still had periods of agitation requiring more sedation. She was
extubated on [**2151-7-31**] and over the next few days remained confused
and sometimes agitated.  Her mental status gradually cleared to
the point that she was alert and oriented to person, sometimes
place and time but getting better daily.

The Opt homology service evaluated her in the Emergency Room as
a retrobulbar hematoma was noted on CT scan and a lateral
canthotomy was done.  She had no evidence of global injury.  On
subsequent exams her IOP was [**10-9**] with no proptosis. She is
receiving NSAIDs and antibiotic eye drops which will continue.
She will need a good eye exam to test visual acuity and should
follow up with Opt homology next week.

From a cardiopulmonary standpoint she was extubated easily on HD
#3 and has remained free of any pulmonary complications.  She
did have problems with tachycardia in the ICU and was evaluated
by the Cardiology service as she has a CPK bump along with a
troponin of 0.77.  She had an echo done which revealed an
akinetic distal LV, possibly Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ( stress
induced ).  She was subsequently started on low dose beta
blocker along with diuresis and her rate gradually improved.
Her BP is in the 110-120/70 range and her heart rate is 80. She
is no longer being diuresed and her most recent BUN/creat is
32/0.9.  She will need to follow up with her PCP after discharge
from rehab.

Her nutritional status was compromised during her stay and she
was started on tube feedings while intubated and for a total of
5 days.  Following extubation she was evaluated by the speech
and swallow service and is currently on a soft diet with thin
liquids.  She is eating modestly and calorie counts should
continue.

She started treatment for an enterococcal UTI on [**2151-8-5**] and
should continue Augmentin through [**2151-8-11**].  Her Foley catheter
was removed on [**2151-8-6**] at noon and she is due to void between
6-8pm tonight.

Following her transfer out of the ICU on [**2151-8-4**] she has been
hemodynamically stable with improving mental status and
interactive.  She was discharged to rehab on [**2151-8-6**] for further
therapy prior to returning home.
