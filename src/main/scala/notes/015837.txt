complicated by neuropathy, nephropathy and peripheral
vascular disease, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine of 1.5 to 1.6, positive bowel study in 10/98 with
a moderate reversible perfusion defect in the inferior
lateral wall, normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.
Cataracts bilaterally.  Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine and morphine sulfate which cause nausea
and vomiting.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glyburide, Lopid, Zantac, Lasix,
Metoprolol XL, Lipitor, aspirin, Motrin, Tylenol and Nitro

FAMILY HISTORY:  Both parents had heart disease.

LABORATORY:  On admission are significant for a hematocrit of
29.9, K of 5.3, BUN of 55, creatinine of 2.0.  Normal coags.
CK of 110, CK MB of 5, troponin of 3.1.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus rhythm with left axis deviation, Q's in V1 and
V2, T-wave inversion AVL but no cute changes.  Chest x-ray
showed increased interstitial markings, question congestive
heart failure.

The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service where he
underwent a rule out myocardial infarction protocol.
Cardiology consult was obtained.  Cardiology did recommend
catheterization.  The patient underwent catheterization on
[**4-22**].  Catheterization showed few vessel coronary artery
disease of the left anterior descending and left circumflex,
elevated right and left filling pressures, moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  The patient also underwent an echocardiogram
which revealed left ventricular enlargement with severe
regional systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation,
pulmonary artery hypertension, mild aortic regurge.  Ejection
fraction was not noted.  The patient was then referred to
Cardiac Surgery Service.  Pulmonary consultation was also
obtained due to the patient's history of hemoptysis.  CT scan
obtained showed no abnormalities aside from prominent
subcarinal lymph node.  These did meet criteria to be
considered enlarged.  Pulmonary consult recommends follow-up
CT scan in [**4-2**] months and consideration of a bronch should
the patient's symptoms recur.  The patient did not have
further evidence of hemoptysis while hospitalized.
Subsequent to the catheterization, the patient underwent
coronary artery bypass graft on [**2182-4-24**].  He had a left
internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior
descending.  He had vein grafts to the right coronary artery
and to the obtuse marginal.  Consequently, the patient was
taken to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit where he
remained on Neo for the first two postoperative days.  He was
extubated on postoperative day two and was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day three.  On the floor, he was
slowly advanced in his diet and activity level.  Physical
Therapy worked with the patient and eventually it was decided
that he was suitable for discharge to home.  He was
discharged to home on postoperative day number six.  On final
day, his incision was clean, dry and intact without a click.
His bilateral lower extremities had ecchymosis but no
erythema.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

follow-up CT scan in [**4-2**] months to further evaluate his
hemoptysis.
