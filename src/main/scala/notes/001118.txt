History of Present Illness:
67 year old gentleman known to our service with a vague cardiac
history which began roughly 15 years ago when he was diagnosed
with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was treated with several
antiarrythmics but has been most
improved as far as his symptoms of palpitations with amiodarone.
He was recently switched from flecanide due to his left
ventricular hypertrophy and continued palpitations. More
recently, he claims he was diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis
in [**2111-12-20**]. An echo at that time showed severe aortic
valve
stenosis with a dilated aortic root. A repeat echocardiogram
this [**Month (only) 956**] revealed worsening disease however the report of
this echocardiogram is unavailable. A cardiac catheterization
was performed which revealed normal coronary arteries, severe
tricuspid aortic valve stenosis and a markedly dilated aortic
root. He presented as same day admission for surgery.

[**2113-5-2**]:
TTE
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Post-bypass:
The patient is receiving no inotropic support post-CPB. There is
a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position with
good leaflet excursion. There is trace, central transvalvular
regurgitation. There was initially a very small paravalvular
regurgitant jet eccentrically directed towards the anterior
mitral leaflet, but was not viewed in later imaging. There is no
residual aortic stenosis. There is a normal appearing ascending
aorta tube graft. Biventricular systolic function is preserved
and all other findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings.
All findings communicated to the surgeon intraoperatively.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**5-2**] where the patient underwent an aortic
valve replacement with 27-mm Biocor Epic tissue
heart valve and resection of the ascending aortic aneurysm and
the ascending aortic repair with 26 mm Gelweave graft under deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest. Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support.  He was kept in the intensive care unit for pulmonary
issues and required aggressive pulmonary toilet.  EP service was
consulted regarding evaluation and management of atrial
fibrillation.  They recommended continuing beta blockers and
titrating up as tolerated, starting amiodarone at 200mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1
week, then 200mg daily and continue warfarin for
anticoagulation.  He was anticoagulated to goal INR of [**12-21**] and
will be followed by [**Hospital **] Medical [**Hospital 197**] clinic for further
dosing instructions for atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight and pulmonary
issues slowly resolved with sats 91-92% on room air at
discharge.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  His Lopressor was increased to 50 mg TID
on day of discharge as the patient went into an atrial
fibrillation prior to discharge with a rate in the 90's.  The
patient was discharged home with VNA services in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
