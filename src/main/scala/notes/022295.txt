Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
VF arrest s/p STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with placement of DES in LAD.


History of Present Illness:
51 yo man no known medical history was noticed to be driving
erratically earlier this morning in NH and ultimately suffered
an unrestrained MVA crashing his car into a tree. Did not appear
to EMS to be traumatic arrest. Found apneic and pulseless in VF,
with downtime of minutes before CPR initiated with EMS. Shocked
3x, epinephrine x2,atropine x1, lidocaine 2g IV then taken to
[**Hospital3 25148**] Center in NH, then to [**University/College **]. On arrival to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED he had a GCS of 7, unconscious. Initial CE were CK:
1694 Trop-T: 4.11 and have EKG changes consistent with STEMI. He
was loaded with amio, ASA, integrillin, and started on heparin
drip. Within 3 hours of his arrest he hit the cath lab and was
found to have total occlusion of the LAD proximally with BMS
placed to the ostium of the LAD. There was also 30% distal RCA
lesion, minimal Lcx disease. He underwent LHC with L
ventriculograpy and coronary angiography which noted proximal TO
of LAD. A BMS was placed.
On leaving the cath lab he was found to be hypertensive and was
started on nitro gtt, and NGT was placed, and transferred to the
CCU.
On arrival to the CCU he was hemodynamically stable. A repeat
EKG at that time showed improvement in his ST elevation post
revascularization. He was weaned off nitro GTT, continued on
amnio and heparin GTT.

Pertinent Results:
ECG Study Date of [**2123-4-17**]  12:07:50 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Acute ST segment
elevation in the
early precordial leads. Consider acute anteroseptal myocardial
infarction.  There are inferior changes which are likely
reciprocal. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Cardiac Cath Date of [**2123-4-17**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal. The
proximal
LAD had a total occlusion. The LCx had minimal disease. The RCA
had a
30% distal stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal blood pressures
with SBP
of 122 mm Hg and DBP of 93 mm Hg.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial LAD with a 3.0 x
23mm Vision bare metal stent. Final angiography revealed no
residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3
flow. (see
PTCA comments for details)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial LAD.

CXR [**2123-4-18**]
FINDINGS: On today's radiograph, an endotracheal tube is seen.
The tip of
the tube projects 6 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube
shows a normal
course, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of
the stomach.  The tip of a right internal jugular venous central
access line projects over the mid-to-lower SVC. Otherwise, there
is no relevant change. Increased lung volumes, subtotal left
lower lobe atelectasis, mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. No larger
pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacities have newly
appeared in the
interval.
.
cxr: [**2123-4-19**]
FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination, presumably supine, with
much of the lateral aspect of left hemithorax excluded. There
has been a dramatic
interval change since the bedside study obtained (for line
placement) the
preceding day. There is now diffuse airspace opacity involving
both lungs,
more confluent on the right, with numerous air-bronchograms.
Allowing for
this (and the positioning), there has been no significant change
in heart
size, pulmonary vascular congestion or significant pleural
effusion. The
right IJ central venous catheter is unchanged with tip at the
superior vena cavo-atrial junction, and no pneumothorax (in this
position). Since the
previous study, the endotracheal and endogastric tubes have been
removed.
IMPRESSION: Extensive diffuse and confluent airspace process
involving both lungs, new since the examination day before.
While this may represent while massive aspiration event, as
questioned clinically, pulmonary edema -either cardiogenic or
noncardiogenic - as well as diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage are
also diagnostic considerations, and should be closely correlated
with clinical data (of which none is available, on review of
OMR).

[**2123-4-19**] -TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely d
