Brief Hospital Course:
On  [**2189-9-2**] he received a cadaveric renal transplant from a high
risk donor (given social history of donor. Discussed with
recipient)placed in the right retroperitoneum. Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Induction immunosuppression consisted of cellcept,
solumedrol and ATG (usually simulect given per HIV/transplant
protocol), but due to higher PRA of 38%, he received ATG 150mg
intraop. The case was difficult due to the patients size. Please
see operative report for complete details. The kidney pinked up
and made a small amount of urine. The kidney was biopsied and
bled a significant amount. Stasis was achieved with Argon. There
was a small subcapsular hematoma.  Postop in PACU he was
hypotensive, tachycardic and unable to be extubated and
transferred to the SICU for care. A Levophed drip was used. ID
was consulted

Intraop, he spiked a temperature to 104 and became hypotensive
most likely from ATG reaction vs infection. He received
Vancomycin and Levaquin perioperatively and was pancultured for
this fever. Urine culture from [**9-2**] grew >100,000 colonies of
E.coli pan-sensitive. ID was consulted and felt that fever most
likely due to ATG than infectious etiology and recommended broad
spectrum antibiotics (vanco/aztreonam and flagyl).

A renal transplant US was done which was  significantly limited
due to patient body habitus and intubated status preventing
adequate breathhold. Doppler waveforms within the upper, inter,
and lower pole demonstrated brisk systolic upstroke and
diastolic flow with slightly elevated RIs of greater than 0.8.
Additionally, waveforms in the renal hila, which were difficult
to obtain, demonstrated diminished diastolic flow. Numerous
attempts to identify flow within the transplant main renal vein
were unsuccessful. CVVHD was begun for hyperkalemia (7.7)and
delayed graft function on pod 1.

He was extubated and transferred out of the SICU to the med-[**Doctor First Name **]
unit.
Nephrology followed him and tailored HD accordingly. The
tunnelled HD line that was present preoperatively was removed
and replaced with a L IJ temporary HD line. This temporary line
was very positional and uncomfortable during HD and was
subsequently replaced on [**9-14**]. Again this catheter was exchanged,
but did not work during HD on [**9-16**] requiring removal. A L
subclavian tunnelled HD line was successfully placed on [**9-16**]. He
received HD on [**9-16**].

A renal transplant biopsy was performed on [**9-9**]. The pathology
report on the biopsy was negative for cellular and humoral
rejection. The differential diagnosis included obstruction, drug
nephrotoxicity, and especially "acute tubular necrosis." The
small focus of interstitial neutrophils raised the possibility
of an infectious process. There was considerable chronic (donor)
vascular disease.

For immunosuppression, he remained on cellcept 1gram [**Hospital1 **],
steroid taper to prednisone 25mg qd and prograf [**Hospital1 **]. Prograf
required up titration to as high as 22mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve trough
levels of 9.4. This unusually high dosage was due to interaction
with his HAART medication. The decision was made to give prograf
15mg q 8 hours as it was difficult to get obtain appropriate
troughs on [**Hospital1 **] dosing and to avoid high peaks and prevent
vasoconstriction. Prograf was dosed at 6am, 2pm and 10pm.

The abdominal incision continued to ooze large amounts of old
bloody fluid from a hematoma. The incision was opened on [**9-13**] and
a vac was placed. Vac outputs averaged 1 liter per day of
serosanguinous.

Urine output continued to be low averaging 50-100cc/24 hours.
Creatinine ranged between 8.5 and 10.5 decreasing due to
dialysis.

Hematocrit trended down to 24 (from preop 35.6) and remained
stable. Epogen was administered at HD. Iron studies revealed a
ferritin of 592, tsf 183 and cal TIBC 238.

Physical therapy evaluated and recommended rehab. He will be
transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab Hospital with continuation of HD
and lab monitoring q Monday and Thursday. Labs results should be
fax'd immediately when available to the [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic attn:
[**Name6 (MD) 5036**] [**Name8 (MD) 5039**], RN coordinator. Immunosuppression should only
be adjusted by the Transplant Center.
