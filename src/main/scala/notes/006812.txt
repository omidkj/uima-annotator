diabetes mellitus, endstage renal disease, who is status post
hemodialysis catheter 4 days prior to his death. Initially

Code blue was called. ACLS was initiated for 30 minutes with
chest compressions, epi x2, atropine x2, insulin, D50 shock
x1. Pulse, blood pressure returned. The patient remained
unresponsive following event. CT/ CTA were done of the head
and neck to evaluate for dissection. CTA was negative for
dissection, however CT demonstrated infarct of bilateral
occipital lobes and subacute thalamic infarcts bilaterally.

Neurology was called. No significant brain stem reflexes were
found. The patient was intubated, no sedation was given in
the event and not responsive to noxious stimuli and had
bilateral papilledema and poor prognosis. The patient is a 53-
year-old male with past medial history significant for CHF

2.  Nexium.

On [**2-24**] after extensive discussion was undertaken with
the family with both the doctor attending, ICU attending, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26687**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], a decision was made to withdraw all
care as the patient was declared brain dead after brain death
examination. The ventilator was withdrawn and the patient
expired shortly after.

Time of death was recorded as 8:56 p.m. on [**2183-2-24**].

Medical examiner was notified and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the medical
examiner's office declined the case, however autopsy
permission was granted by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] and autopsy was
to be performed expeditiously as there were still no clear
etiology as per the asystolic event that lead to an anoxic
brain injury and eventual brain death and demise in this
patient.

On the night of [**2183-2-24**], I declared the patient after
withdrawal of support.
