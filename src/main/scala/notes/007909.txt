Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 87305**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64 year old female with stage IV lung cancer, CAD s/p MI, T2DM,
Afib, and HTN who presents with an acute exacerbation of her
shortness of breath.
.
She received chemo yesterday at [**Location (un) 2274**].  After she returned home,
she had the acute onset of SOB at 4-5pm yesterday.  She denies
chest pain, but "just couldn't breathe."  At first she drank
some juice and her husband tried to get her to eat but her
dyspnea worsened significantly and she called EMS.  She also
reports low grade fevers 99-100 at night.  Denies cough or
sputum production.
.
She went to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ED where she was febrile to 100.2.
CT chest was done which showed a left sided infiltrate and a
right sided filling defect with segmental PE.  She was given
CTX/azithro and started on a heparin gtt without a bolus.  Hct
was reportedly 28 with INR 1.3.  She was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.6 84 171/29 16 97%.  She desatted
to the high 80's on NC with SBP 90-100's.  Labs were notable for
an initial Hct of 11.4 with repeat of 22.5 (without
intervention).  INR 1.4, Creat 0.5, WBC 6.4.  On heparin gtt @
1450/hr.  Was on NRB for a while but now on 5L nasal cannula and
)2 sats in the mid-90's.  SBPs 90-100's.  Given 1L NS.  Atrius
oncology is aware of admission.  Uploaded CT into PACS.  Most
recent vitals 90 (irregular) 100/49 22 97%5L.  Has 2 PIVs.
.
Currently, she reports she is feeling back to baseline.  At
baseline, she is short of breath with walking more than a few
steps.  She walks with a walker and has profound leg weakness
due to a potential steroid myopathy that has been slowly getting
better over the last several weeks.

IMAGING:
CTA [**2195-5-7**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Right pulmonary stable filling defect since [**2195-5-1**], in the
absence of
other sites of thrombi, this could represent tumor and/or in
situ thrombus, particularly as it is directly adjacent to the
site of resection.
2. Diffuse esophagitis.
3. Enhancing right moderately large pleural effusion, suspicious
for a
malignant effusion.
4. Moderately severe emphysema.
5. Diffuse ground-glass opacity, stable since [**2195-5-1**], but new
since [**2195-3-10**], may represent diffuse drug reaction, atypical
pneumonia or edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with stage IV lung cancer, CAD s/p MI, T2DM,
Afib, and HTN who presents with new right sided PE and increased
O2 requirement.
.
# CP/SOB: Patient had 3 episodes this admission of CP and SOB,
which after much investigation (including CTA which showed no
new process) was determined to be atrial fibrillation likely
causing some pain with demand ischemia (but negative cardiac
enzymes x3) and also severe GERD from esophagitis noted on CTA.
Ativan and maalox fixed the CP, and the SOB improved once
patient's HR was decreased with IV lopressor, and then we
uptitrated pt's metoprolol to 25mg TID to better control her
afib.  She was given SL NTG, but this did not help as much as
controlling her HR.  Her SOB also was mildly improved after
1uPRBCs [**5-7**].  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout
each of her episodes, although she did drop her BP to the low
90's after she was given 2 SL NTG and lopressor at the same
time, but this quickly resolved with IVF.
.
#. PE: Pt initially on heparin, has been transitioned to
lovenox.  O2 requirement stable at 3L (baseline 2L).  She has
remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of overload.
She has remained tachycardic in 100-140's (see above) throughout
this admission.  Has been ruled out for MI.  Therefore we
continued her lovenox, but she will likely need teaching for
this on dispo from rehab.  She will need to be weaned back to
her home dose of 2L NC O2 as tolerated.
.
#. Pneumonia: Initially on Levoflox for CAP on admission, but as
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been recently hospitalized and then in rehab for
an extended period, we felt this was not adequate tx.  This was
especially true as she continued to be febrile after 48hrs on
antibiotics. Moderate right sided pleural effusion noted on CT
scan could represent an empyema, however, this has been noted on
prior CT scans making this less likely.  She was broadened to
vanc + cefepime (day 1= [**5-3**]) given patient's exposure history
and poor pulmonary reserve to cover for Pseudomonas and MRSA.
UCx and urine legionella were negative.  Sputum Cx had commensal
resp flora.  She will need to complete a 14 day course of
antibiotics (last dose 5/7).
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Has been in controlled afib w/ some
spikes
