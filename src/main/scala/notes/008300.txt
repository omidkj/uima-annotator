History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 82 yo female with PMHx of SBO who presents from rehab
with hypotension.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] end of [**7-6**] with partial SBO. She
was taken to the OR and no mechanical obstruction was found. She
did have a thickened terminal ileum. Biopsy revealed fibrosis.
Colonoscopy was attempted a few times, but was unable to get to
the ileum. TPN was started at that time as pt was nutritionally
at risk.
.
Pt was again recently d/cd from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2192-11-2**] after being
admitted to the surgery service with a partial SBO. Complicating
this was a upper extremity thrombus in right and left subclavian
veins and left internal jugular and brachiocephalic veins in the
setting of a PICC. The PICC line was pulled and a Hickman was
placed for pt's TPN. Additionally, pt was started on prednisone
for possible IBD as it was thought that the distal ileal
thickening was causing symptoms of SBO.
.
Per Rehab notes on [**2192-11-16**], pt was noted to have increased
edema and weight gain from 165-->179 lbs in 7 days. Also notes
dependent lungs with crackles at bases and that BPs in 80s-90s.
She was started on levaquin on [**2192-11-17**] (unclear per notes).
Lasix was increased from 20 mg qday to 40 mg qday but has been
held [**3-1**] hypotension. She complained of pain upon swallowing for
days. Strep test was negative.
.
For the last few days, BPs have remained consistently low. Pt
denies any F/C. No SOB/CP. No lightheadedness/dizziness. +stable
chronic cough x years. No sputum production. Pt states that she
feels "ok." No diarrhea. No dysuria.
.
In the ED, VS on arrival were: T: 97.2; HR: 90; BPs: 80s
systolic; O2: 99 RA. She was given 500 mg IV metronidazole, 500
mg IV levaquin, 1 g of vancomycin IV, ipratropium nebulizers,
albuterol nebulizers, and 10 mg of IV dexamethasone. She was
also given 75 mg of plavix and 1 L NS.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2192-11-19**] 11:33 PM
1. No evidence of pulmonary edema or focal consolidations.
2. Possible small right pleural effusion.
3. Tip of the right IJ catheter in the right atrium. Recommend
retracting.
.
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2192-11-20**] 5:01 PM
1. No cervical lymphadenopathy.
2. Very slight asymmetry of left fossa of Rosenmuller and right
posterior pharyngeal wall, of uncertain clinical significance.

COMMENT: Given the clinical context, these findings could be
correlated with direct inspection by fiberoptic endoscopy.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2192-11-20**] 4:12 PM
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left jugular,
subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins was
performed. These demonstrate normal compressibility, waveforms,
and flow. No intraluminal thrombus is identified. Previously
seen thrombus within the left axillary and subclavian veins is
no longer identified. Left basilic vein is not visualized.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2192-11-29**] 4:04 PM
1. At least 20-cm length of thickened ileum likely from ileitis.
This is nonspecific and likely infectious or inflammatory. No
evidence for extension beyong the bowel wall.

2. Equivocal thickening of colon at the splenic flexure through
the descending colon and into the sigmoid, also nonspecific.
When the patients condition stablizes colonoscopy should be
performed.

3. Thickened distal esophageal wall. Endoscopy should be
considered.

4. Large simple-appearing left renal cyst.

5. Distended gallbladder without direct evidence of
cholecystitis.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2192-12-5**] 6:59 PM
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: 3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle
of [**Location (un) 431**] was performed. There is normal signal along the distal
vertebrobasilar circulation. Mild atherosclerotic changes are
seen involving the cavernous ICA. The visualized anterior,
middle, and posterior cerebral arteries were patent. There is no
significant intracranial vascular stenosis or occlusions. The
examination is insensitive to detect tiny aneurysms less than 3
mm in diameter. There is tortuosity involving the origin of the
PCA. 40% stenosis is noted involving the right cavernous ICA.

IMPRESSION: Mild 40% stenosis involving the right cavernous ICA.
No other significant intracranial vascular stenoses or
occlusions were present. The exam is insensitive to detect tiny
aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F with hx of partial SBO, ileitis on chronic steroids and TPN,
dysphagia, now with new inpatient diagnosis of GI amyloidosis as
a result of primary amyloidosis, placed on hospice due to
multiple comorbidities giving poor prognosis even with
treatment.
.
# Hypotension/third-spacing:
Ddx included sepsis (though no WBC, bld/urine NGTD, lactate 2.0,
no clear source of infection), cardiogenic (echo without wall
motion [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] nl), volume depletion or adrenal insufficiency.
Per pt's daughter, these sx started soon after her steroids were
tapered (started 3 weeks ago). Pt still has extensive 3rd
spacing due to poor nutritional status. s/p 3u pRBCs for colloid
replacement of volume. BP currently normotensive, with SBP 110s,
pt asymptomatic. Changed prednisone to decadron on [**11-24**] (60mg
pred = 9mg decadron). Evaluated primary adrenal insufficiency
