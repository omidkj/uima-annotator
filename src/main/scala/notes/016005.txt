Brief Hospital Course:
Neurosurgery:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks on
[**2157-12-4**]. He was found to have a very large right frontal mass
and due to his history of lymphoma he was not placed on
steroids. This was to ensure that we would have an accurate
biopsy. The patient was taken off his aspirin and plavix in
anticipation of surgery and was given a 6-pack of platelets
prior to going to the OR.

He had a right steriotactic brain biopsy on [**2157-12-5**]. The
preliminary pathology was consistent with lymphoma and he was
started on dexamethasone intra-operatively. The procedure went
well with no complications. The post-op head CT showed no
hemorrhage. The patient was kept in the ICU overnight for Q 1
hour neuro checks. His exam remained unchanged. He continued to
have very poor vision in the right eye but otherwise he was
neurologically intact. The patient was changed to Q4 hour neuro
checks on [**2157-12-6**]. Since the patient was neurologically stable
and there was no further neurosurgery that could be offered the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] on the oncology
service for urgent treatment for brain lymphoma.

Transfer - Medicine [**2157-12-6**]:
Pt is a 61 yo male with hx of large B cell lymphoma of the
testis and CLL/SLL by BM biopsy who presents with decreased
visual acuity and difficulty with balance since [**Month (only) 205**] of this
year. MRI with 7x7cm mass in right frontal lobe s/p stereotatic
brain biopsy. Preliminary pathology -lymphoma.
.
#Right Frontal Lobe Brain Mass/Lymphoma: On transfer to medicine
patient was continued on Dexamethasone 4mg Q6hrs, Dilantin 100mg
TID, and Q4hour neurologic exams. On transfer the patient's only
neurologic deficit was decreased visual acuity in the right eye.
Patient underwent BM biopsy and CT Torso to stage disease. Pt
then started on IV HD Methotrexate. Patient tolerated the
methotrexate well. During this time the patient's ASA/Plavix was
held. Patient's neurologic exam throughout hospitalization
remained unchanged - with the only deficit being decreased
visual acuity in the right eye. The patient was re-started on
ASA (but at lower dose of 81mg daily instead of 325mg daily) but
the plavix continued to be held (given concern for decreasing
platelets in the setting of MTX therapy), as per the
neurosurgical note and email discussion with the pat
