Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
AVASTIN

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
58 M h/o NSCLC stage III s/p chemo, RUL lobectomy and no
residual thoracic/abd/pelvic disease on CT with brain mets s/p
cyberknife x 3, CAD, COPD fev1 of 69% p/w cough and shortness of
breath. Patient started feeling poorly after his last radiation
treatment with cyberknife on [**2173-3-11**].  Started having URI
symptoms with mild cough, congestion.  Since last night he felt
very short of breath and was unable to get a ride to the ED
until today, worsening shrotness of breath over this period of
time and worsening cough prodcutive of yellow/white sputum.  He
uses 2-3L of nasal cannula O2 per chart nightly, but per pt and
family he only uses this abourt "one hour per week."  Denies any
fevers.  Does have pain in his lower chest/upper abdomen with
coughing, no vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, constipation or other
complaints.  Brought to ED by wife and daughter in law.  Pt
Polish speaking only so interview was conducted with
interpreter.
.
On presentation to the ED, vital signs were t99.5, hr150s,
sbp90s, with sats 95% on room air but breathing 40bpm. On exam
he had increased work of breathing with use of intercostal
muscles, rhonchi and exp wheezes bilaterally, othwerise
nonfocal.  CXR appeared unchanged from baseline but temp to
100.3 and appeared toxic, so he was given levofloxacin. He had a
CTA since he had tachycardia, hypoxia which showed no PE but LLL
not visualized well due to motion artifact, and mult ground
glass opacities suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. He was given
vancomycin and cefepime in addition to the levofloxacin dose, 1L
of fluid, and albuterol x 3, atrovent x 3, and started bipap
which helped with decreased work of breathing.  Abg was
7.4/31/170/28 while on bipap.  He was taken off bipap and
tolerated NRB on transfer to the unit.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt feels much better and is comfortable
on NRB.  Denies any complaints currently.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- presented to [**Hospital1 2177**] [**3-/2170**] with shortness of breath, CT showed
RUL lung mass, bronchoscopy was done but pt was lost to f/u
until
[**10-19**]
- [**10-19**] presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58318**] at [**Hospital1 18**], CT [**2170-10-31**] showed
2.7cm x 2.7 cm spiculated irregular nodule in the posterior RUL
with associated 1.3 cm precarinal lymph node
- [**2170-12-14**]: bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy with sampling of 4L,
4R, level 7 lymph nodes.  Lymph node biopsies negative
- [**2170-12-21**]: CT-guided lung biopsy showed carcinoma with clear
cell features consistent with renal origin.  Because the
specimen was CK7 positive, TTF-1 positive and CK20 negative, it
was felt to be most consistent with a primary lung tumor.  No
renal
lesion was seen.
- [**2170-12-22**]: PET again revealing the 2.7 x 2.7 cm right upper
lobe mass, which was markedly FDG avid (SUV 12.7).  The
previously
noted precarinal lymph node of 1.8 x 0.5 cm was also FDG avid
(SUV 10.5).  A paratracheal lymph node of 0.6 cm had an SUV of
3.6.
- [**2170-12-26**] MRI Brain: no evidence of metastatic disease.
- [**2171-2-4**]: repeat bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound was
done due to the markedly FDG-avid precarinal lymph node seen on
PET scan. The 4R lymph node station was again sampled, which
revealed the presence of malignant cells, consistent with
adenocarcinoma.
- [**2171-3-4**] XRT with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide for 2
cycles
- [**2171-4-17**]: repeat bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy to assess for
residual lymph node disease revealed malignant cells in the 4R
lymph node, making him not a surgical candidate
- continued XRT only, completed [**2171-5-1**]
- [**2171-6-18**]:  resumed chemotherapy with cisplatin-pemetrexed at
doses of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day
1, given on [**2171-6-18**] and [**2171-7-9**].
- [**2171-7-25**]: CT Chest showed reduction in size of RUL mass
[**7-/2171**]/[**2172**]: Stable disease on imaging without treatment.
- [**2172-6-24**]: PET scan showed new right hilar mass and increased
avidity of RUL nodule.  Brain MRI negative for metastatic
disease.
- [**2172-7-6**]: Carboplatin (AUC 6), Taxol (200mg/m2), Bevacizumab.
Course complicated by CVA on [**2172-7-18**] which subsequently resolved.
- [**2172-7-28**]- [**2172-9-8**]: Received 3 additional cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/Taxol
with Bevacizumab omitted.  CT with stable disease.
- RUL lobectomy on [**2172-11-6**] and RML lobectomy for atelectatic
lung on [**2172-11-22**]
- [**Date range (3) 76763**]- presentes with new onset seizures with
discovery of new brain metastases, started on decadron and
keppra
- [**Date range (2) 76764**]: 3 single fraction treatments with Cyberknife
for brain metastases from NSC lung cancer
