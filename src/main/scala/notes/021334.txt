Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Hospital **] transfer from [**Hospital1 1474**] for cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization on [**2113-2-8**]
Endotracheal intubation
Central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
64 year-old female with a PMHx significant for HTN, + tobacco,
and s/p right CEA, who initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
on [**2113-2-7**] with a 4-day history of URI symptoms with cough,
fever, as well as diarrhea, myalgia and general malaise. Per
records, WBC 13.7, initial CXR with pulmonary vascular
congestion, no infiltrate. Nonetheless, she was treated for a
possible COPD exacerbation +/- pneumonia with Azithromycin and
Ceftriaxone + nebs (ruled out for influenza with nasal swab). On
[**2113-2-8**], she became acutely SOB, with desats to 80s on 2L via
NC, put on 100% NRB with sats still in 80s. Her CXR showed
worsening pulmonary edema, and EKG revealed ST elevations in
leads V2-3. BNP 758, CK 360, MB 3.6, Trop I 1.3. She was given
ASA, Lopressor 5 mg IV X 1, and Lasix 20 mg IV X 2, started on a
heparin gtt with a bolus. She was intubated for hypoxia and
started on Propofol. She became hypotensive, and was switched to
Fentanyl, but remained hypotensive. She was emergently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on med flight and brought to cath.

She underwent cardiac catheterization upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**],
which revealed diffuse, mild to moderate disease that was felt
to be chronic, without acute thrombosis. She was briefly started
on Dopamine on arrival, turned off, then required Levophed in
cath lab for hypotension. She was inadvertently extubated, and
reintubated. She was transferred to the CCU on Levophed for
further management.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2113-2-8**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
moderate three vessel CAD. There was diffuse disease throughout
the
coronary tree. The LMCA had mild diffuse disease. The LAD had a
40%
proximal stenosis and a 70% tubular mid-vessel stenosis with
spasm and
normal flow. The Lcx was diffusely diseased with the worst
stenosis
being a 70% distal vessel stenosis before the take off of an OM
branch.
The RCA was initially diffusely spastic but improved along with
the LAD
once intracoronary nitroglycerin was given. It had a tubular 70%

mid-vessel stenosis.
2. Hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart filling
pressures
with wedge pressure of 25mm Hg and RA pressures of 20mm Hg.
There was
mild pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac index was preserved at 3.4.

3. Left ventriculography revealed severe regional LV dysfunction
with
anterior, inferior and apical akinesis with preserved basal
function
(consistent with "apical ballooning" or focal myocarditis).
There was no
mitral regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

ECHO [**2113-2-8**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to
akinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, and
dyskinesis of the apex. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot
be excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is severe hypokinesis
of the apical half of the right ventriclular free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


ECHO [**2113-2-13**]:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include apical, apical anteroseptal,
apical inferior, apical anterior, apical inferolateral
hypokinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. Normal mitral valve leaqflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2113-2-8**], there is a marked improvement in LV function.

Brief Hospital Course:
Her hospital course will be reviewed by problems.

1) CAD: As mentioned above, Ms. [**Known lastname 50261**] was taken to the cath lab
on admission. Coronary angiography revealed non-occlusive
3-vessel CAD, elevated right and left-sided filling pressures
with PCWP 25, and LVEF 25% with anterior, inferior and apical
akinesis with preserved basal function (apical ballooning). The
findings of severe LV systolic dysfunction with associated EKG
suggestive of acute injury but without critical coronary lesion
in a setting of apparent viral illness was felt most consistent
with viral myocarditis. An anterior STEMI with lysed thrombus
was felt unlikely. PE was also unlikely given the degree of
systolic dysfunction. Her peak troponin was 1.09.

Her CAD was medically managed with ASA, and Lipitor.
Beta-blockade therapy and [**Last Name (un) **] were introduced and titrated as
her blood pressure toler
