   OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2132-12-12**]):
      NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium,
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected
by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when
organisms
      are rare.

   Cryptosporidium/Giardia (DFA) (Final [**2132-12-12**]):
      NO CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OR GIARDIA SEEN.

Imaging:
CXR [**12-10**]: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process
.
Echo [**12-11**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
LE doppler [**12-11**]: Negative for proximal deep venous thrombosis
bilateral lower extremities.
.
EKG [**12-11**]:Probable ectopic atrial rhythm Borderline right axis
deviation Low limb lead QRS voltages Poor R wave progression
with late precordial QRS transition Finding are nonspecific but
clinical correlation is suggested for possible chronic pulmonary
disease
Since previous tracing of [**2132-12-10**], ST-T wave changes decreased

XR Pelvis [**2132-12-12**]: There are old fractures identified of
bilateral sacral ala, right medial acetabulum, right superior
and inferior pubic rami.  No new fractures are identified.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-13**]:
1.  No evidence of psoas abscess, or process related to the
patient's leg weakness.
2. Anasarca, with new small pleural effusions, small amount o
