Chief Complaint:
Upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy
TIPS procedure
Central Venous Line Placement
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 31 yo man with alcohol abuse and new diagnosis
of cirrhosis who was transferred from the [**Location (un) **] ICU for
management of upper GI bleed. The patient was in his USOH until
10pm last night when he had >30 bouts of bright red hematemesis
about 15 minutes apart with an estimated total amount of 2 L. He
also had a large, black, tarry bowel movement. He called his PCP
who referred him to the [**Location (un) **] ED.
.
Presenting vs were: T 98.7, P 148, BP 108/55, RR 20, O2sat 100%
RA. Labs showed Hct 14.9, Plts 126, INR 2.7. He was admitted to
the ICU and then taken shortly thereafter to the endoscopy
suite. He was found to have an actively bleeding lesion, thought
to be a Dieulafoy's lesion and less likely a gastric varix. GI
was able to place a clip but felt it was tenuous. They also
noted an esophageal mass and a question of grade I esophageal
varices. They recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **] for
higher level of care. The patient was transfused a total of 5
units pRBC and 4 units FFP at [**Location (un) **] and was given 3.5 L of IVF
and a banana bag. He also was given octreotide, zofran, and
ativan 1mg. Repeat labs prior to transfer showed Hct of 17. He
reportedly has not been hypotensive. At the time of sign-out, he
was still recovering from conscious sedation in the endoscopy
suite with the following VS: BP 91/30, P 111, O2sat 100% RA. Per
[**Location (un) **], his BPs remained stable en route but he was
tachycardic to the 120s throughout.
.
On arrival, pt had another melanic bowel movement. He reports
feeling mildly nauseated and during his exam, had two small
bouts of bilious emesis with a few dark clots. He denies any
abdominal pain, chest pain, lightheadedness.
.
He reports having felt nauseated several times in the past week
but had never had any previous episodes of hematemesis, melana,
or hematochezia. He denies pruritis but has noticed jaundice of
his eyes and skin for several weeks as well as yellow stools and
occasionally dark urine. He has also noted increased abdominal
girth for months. He denies any NSAID or tylenol use. He reports
drinking alcohol socially since he was a teenager, then more
heavily since age 22, with regular intake of [**12-26**] pints of vodka
daily in the past 1-2 years. He admits to prior cocaine and
heroine use; denies IVDU. He has multiple tattoos done by a
friend but reports testing negative for HIV and hepatitis after
his most recent one. His birth mother also has a history of
alcohol abuse but there is no known family history of liver
disease.

[**5-5**] Chest X-Ray:
AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
Tip of the endotracheal tube is just above the level of the
sternal notch, no less than 5.5 cm above the carina. With the
chin elevated this is standard placement. Lung volumes are low
exaggerating mild interstitial abnormality and vascular
congestion as well as heart size which is probably top normal.
No pneumonia, pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound:
The findings are consistent with cirrhosis, splenomegaly,
ascites and portal hypertension. Portal venous system is patent
but flow is hepatofugal throughout the portal and splenic veins.


ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT Head:
No acute intracranial abnormality.
