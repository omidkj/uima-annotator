Pertinent Results:
Cath [**9-22**]: Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant circulation demonstrated two vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA was without any angiographically apparent
coronary artery disease. The LAD had a 40% stenosis at the
origin. There was a "shelf-like" 90% stenosis at the takeoff of
the D1. The distal LAD had mild to moderate diffuse disease. The
D1 was a relatively large vessel with a 50% stenosis. The D2 was
a small caliber vessel. The LCx had mild diffuse disease
throughout its course about the AV groove. The OM1, OM2, and OM3
were all relatively small caliber vessels with mild plaquing.
The RCA had an ostial 80%stenosis. The remaining RCA had mild
luminal irregularities. The R-PDA had moderate disease at its
origin. The R-PL was a relatively small vessel. There were no
collaterals noted. Left ventriculography demonstrated normal
systolic ventricular function with a calculated ejection
fraction of 59%. There was 3+ mitral regurgitation noted. The
peak to peak transaortic pressure gradient was 20mmHg and the
mean gradient was 16mmHg. The [**Location (un) 109**] using the Gorlin equation was
1.1cm2.
CNIS [**9-23**]: Minimal right ICA plaque, no associated stenosis
(graded as less than 40%). Normal left carotid system.
Chest CT [**9-25**]: Biapical scarring without evidence of cavitation
or small airways disease to suggest active infection. Probable
focus of nodular scarring within superior segment right lower
lobe adjacent to superior portion of major fissure; however, in
the setting of emphysema, a scar carcinoma cannot be excluded.
Followup chest CT is recommended in three months to assess
interval stability/change. Prominent right paratracheal lymph
nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement,
but should be reassessed on the followup chest CT in three
months. Bilateral thyroid nodules measuring up to 22 mm in size
on the right. A thyroid ultrasound would better characterize
this abnormality, if warranted clinically. Extensive coronary
artery and aortic valve calcifications.
Echo [**9-26**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets
are myxomatous. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-2**]+)mitral regurgitation is seen. Post-Bypass: A well
seated aortic valve bioprosthesis, functioning well, PG15 and
mean gradient of 8. Aortic contour is intact. Preserved
biventricular systolic function. Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
CXR [**9-30**]: IJ catheter terminating in the right atrium. Stable
appearance of left retrocardiac density that could represent
collapse and/or consolidation. Persistent pleural effusions.
Interval significant improvement of a poorly defined airspace
opacity in the left mid lung region, which favors aspiration
etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from OSH to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cath. She underwent cath on [**9-22**] which revealed 2
vessel coronary artery disease [**Doctor First Name **] with mitral and aortic valve
disease. She then underwent an echocardiogram which confirmed
moderate to severe aortic stenosis but showed only mild mitral
regurgitation. Cardiac surgery consulted on patient for surgical
intervention. She underwent multiple diagnostic work-up prior to
surgery which included CNIS, chest CT, and dental consult. Over
then next several days she received medical management awaiting
Plavix work-out before surgery. On [**9-26**] she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 3 and aortic valve replacement. Please see operative
report for surgical details. She tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in
stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologcially intact and extubated. On post-op day one
she had an episode of SVT which was cardioverted electrically
and started on Amiodarone. She had her chest tubes removed and
was weaned off of Neo-Synephrine. On post-op day two she was
started on diuretics and beta blockers. She was gently diuresed
towards her pre-op weight. Her epicardial pacing wires were
removed and she was transferred to the SDU. Also on this day she
received blood transfusion for low HCT. On post-op day three she
again had episode of SVT which converted to SR. She was started
on Coumadin. On post-op day four pulmonary medicine consulted on
Ms. [**Known lastname **] for pre-op w/u that revealed apical nodule densities.
Over the next several days the patients activity level was
advanced and on POD7 it was decided she was stable and ready for
discharge to home with visiting nurses.
