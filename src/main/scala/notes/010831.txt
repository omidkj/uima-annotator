Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
65 y/o female who has developed developed severe scoliosis with
draping of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius
overlying the scoliotic spine. This resulted in long-term
compression with underlying malacia and septic bronchiectasis
of the right lower and right middle lobe resulting in recurrent
infections yearly and dyspnea requiring supplemental oxygen
therapy when she is in her [**Location 27224**] of [**Location (un) 61361**].

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right bronchomalacia s/p Right thorocotomy,right middle/lower
lobectomy, right bronchoplasty, T4 vertebrectomy ([**4-13**])
 Flexible bronchoscopy with extraction of thick tenacious
    sputum from right lower and right middle lobe and
    evaluation of airways.
2.  Right thoracotomy with bilobectomy, right lower lobectomy
    and right middle lobectomy.
3.  Bronchoplasty of right main bronchus with mesh.
4.  Pedicled intercostal muscle flap.
5.1) Partial vertebrectomy T5,6,7,;2) Fusion T5-8;3) Autograft.
6.  Multiple intercostal nerve blocks.


History of Present Illness:
65-
year-old woman who has developed severe scoliosis with
draping of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius
overlying the scoliotic spine. This resulted in long-term
compression with underlying malacia and septic bronchiectasis
of the right lower and right middle lobe. She develops
recurrent infections yearly and also becomes dyspneic
requiring supplemental oxygen therapy when she is in her
[**Location 27224**] of [**Location (un) 61361**]. We extensively evaluated her and
ultimately felt the best approach would be to perform a right
thoracotomy and likely a bilobectomy involving the right
lower and right middle lobe.
Secondarily, we felt it was necessary to perform an anterior
vertebrectomy to remove a chronic source of external
compression and then to perform a bronchoplasty with mesh to
reshape the airway to its normal configuration and strengthen
its back wall.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2108-4-19**] 5:01 PM
Reason: assess lung expansion

65 year old woman with r. pleural [**Doctor Last Name **] drain just removed
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess lung expansion
TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**2108-4-19**].

COMPARISON: [**2108-4-16**].

INDICATION: [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain removed. Assess for lung expansion.

There has been removal of a right-sided chest tube. A right
hydropneumothorax is without interval change with a small apical
pneumothorax component and a small to moderate amount of pleural
fluid on the right. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
Focal opacity adjacent to surgical chain sutures in the right
lower lobe is likely due to postoperative atelectasis and/or
contusion. Additional opacities in the right perihilar region
may reflect asymmetrical edema, atelectasis, or infection. Left
pleural effusion decreased in size in the interval. Finally, a
relatively spherical opacity in the right suprahilar region is
probably unchanged allowing for technical differences, and may
reflect a loculated component of pleural fluid given its sharp
but incomplete borders, and less likely focal parenchymal
abnormality.

IMPRESSION: No change in right hydropneumothorax following right
chest tube removal.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-12**] and 28:
Mild pulmonary edema is improving, particularly in the left
lung. Small left pleural effusion has redistributed but not
changed in overall volume. There is only a small right basal
pleural air collection drained by two looped pleural drains. An
apical drain is unchanged in position and a tiny apical
pneumothorax persists. Heart size is normal, shifted to the left
because of severe thoracolumbar scoliosis.

FINDINGS:
1.  Slight deformity of the mid tracheal zone with some
    bowing in of the right anterior region, able to be easily
