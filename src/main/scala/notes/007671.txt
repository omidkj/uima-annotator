Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Prednisone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Poorly responsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation, extubation.


History of Present Illness:
51 year-old right-handed female with a history of COPD,
depression, and hypothyroidism who presented after being found
unresponsive. According to the patient's family, she was
recently hospitalized for a COPD flare at [**Hospital **] Hospital for
several days, and just discharged home the day prior to
admission on a dexamethasone taper. On the afternoon of
admission, the patient reportedly was complaining of headache
for much of the afternoon. She was reported to be at her
baseline by one of her daughters at around 4pm. Around 4:45pm,
however, one of her daughters went into her apartment to check
on her and found her slumped over in her bed, unresponsive. She
was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where she was given Narcan x2,
with no effect, then intubated because of inability to protect
her airway. Nursing notes do mention one episode of questionable
seizure activity following intubation (though unclear what this
consisted of), for which she was given Ativan. She underwent a
head CT which was concerning for bilateral occipital and
cerebellar infarcts. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

Past Medical History:
- COPD, complicated by multiple exacerbations in the past and
recent hospitalization.
- Depression.
- Hypothyroidsm.



Social History:
The patient lives in [**Hospital1 **], MA. She lives by herself but her
mother, sister, and brother live in an apartment downstairs from
her. She has two daughters (23 and 17 years old). She quit
tobacco 3 years ago after smoking 2 packs a day for
approximately 35 years (70 pack year history). She denies
alcohol use and drug use, although she does have a distant drug
abuse history (reports that she quit 16 years ago).

Family History:
The patient's mother had an extensive tobacco history and had
lung cancer and lymphoma. The patient reports heart disease on
her father's side. Her older brother died suddenly approximately
3 years ago with no autopsy performed. Her maternal grandmother
suffered from a stroke.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-2**] Non-contrast head CT: Small sub-arachnoid hemorrhage right
frontal and left parietal, little changed from prior study.
White matter hypodenstiy in bilateral PCA territories noted,
though not significant changed from 18:47 hrs on OSH study and
without significant edema. There is some suggestion of
grey-white differentiation loss in the left occipital region.
Chronicity of these findings is uncertain.
.
[**6-2**] CT-angiogram: Patent cervical and intracranial circulation.
No filling defects, stenosis or occlusions identified. No
aneurysms or other vascular malformation.
.
[**6-2**] MRI head: Symmetric and extensive areas of fast diffusion
involving the basal ganglia, parietal and occipital lobes and
both cerebellum, suggesting a global hypoxic event and
hypoperfusion rather than an embolic stroke or vascular
territory related infarct.
.
[**6-2**] CXR: Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with
atelectatic changes in the left lower lobe, possible small
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**6-3**] Echocardiogram: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale seen. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen. LVEF
>55%.
.
[**6-3**] EEG: Abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of rare
independent left and right centroparietal spike discharges,
occasionally followed by a slow wave. There is a brief 5 second
run of rhythmic [**2-2**] Hz spike and slow wave activity over the
right occipital region without a clinical correlate. In
addition, there are frequent periods of [**2-2**] Hz posteriorly
predominant delta slowing seen throughout the tracing. Patterns
are suggestive of a large area of cerebral dysfunction in the
bilateral parietal-occipital area, with epileptogenic potential.
In addition, the disorganized theta frequency background with
additional superimposed bursts of generalized delta slowing is
consistent with a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy,
commonly seen with medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or
infection. There were no definite electrographic seizures seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 89119**] presenting after being found acutely unresponsive at
home. She was recently discharged from [**Hospital **] hospital for a
COPD flare and was still on a dexamethasone taper. She was
intubated at [**Hospital **] hospital after she did not respond to
Narcan in order to protect her airways.  There was some motor
activity during this process which was interpreted as a possible
seizure. CT-Imaging was notable for
bilateral occipital hypodensities and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation. Furthermore, there were hypodensities in the
thalamic and preiventricular regions as well as in the
cerebellum bilaterally. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care. She was intubated and sedated in the ED. When she was off
sedation,
she had bilateral dilated pupils which responded sluggishly to
light. The remainder of her cranial nerves were intact. She did
show purposeful withdrawal from painful stimuli x 4. The CTA
indicated that all vessels were open, in partiuclar the basilar
artery and both posterior cerebral arteries. She has known mild
hypertension, but no reported HLD or DM as alternate risk
factors.  An MRI was done which demonstrated
bilateral symmetric and extensive areas of DWI abnormalities in
the parietal and occipital lobes and both cerebellum with
corresponding T2 and
FLAIR signal changes predominantly involving the white matter
and to a lesser
extent involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter. Absence of signal changes in
ADC sequences suggest
normalization and the overall appearances are likely to suggest
global hypoxia
and hypoperfusion rather than an embolic source or territorial
infarct. Trace
of subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen in the right cerebral sulci.
Small focus
of bright diffusion overlying the right cerebral hemisphere is
likely to be
extra-axial or related to hemorrhage. There is no intracranial
mass. The
ventricular dimensions are stable. The sulcal configuration is
prominent and
slightly advanced for age. Abnormal signal changes are seen to
extend and
involve both basal ganglia.

The following day she was extubated, she continued to have
difficulty with vision with greater than 20/200 in both eyes.
Echo did not demonstrate a PFO or ASD seen.
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.  An
EEG demonstrated (preliminary)delta slowing in the occipital
leads and perietal occipital spiking.

The following day she woke up with 20/25 vision in bilateral
eyes.  Her pupils remained about 7 mm and sluggish but reactive.
  She had not complaints and requested to go home.

Therefore with the rapid resolution of symptoms no furt
