Pt evaluated by ENT in the ED: performed laryngoscopy. per ENT
'Retroflexed epiglottis and abnormal positioning may give the
impression of airway compression without clinical disease.'
They recommended decadron 10mg IV x 1,increase PPI to 40 [**Hospital1 **],

MRI of the neck
There is increased T2 signal arising from the posterior wall of
the
supraglottic larynx, with mild thickening of the epiglottic
folds, suggestive of edema within this region. No discrete mass
lesion is identified. The glottic region, and vocal cords appear
grossly normal. The airway does appear patent throughout,
without evidence of occlusion.

There is an incidental note of tortuous carotids approaching
midline in the retropharyngeal region. Additionally, the thyroid
is heterogeneous,
suggestive of possible tiny nodules. Visualized lung apices
reveal left upper lobe nodule, as seen on CT neck and CT chest
from [**2197-4-19**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Edema within the posterior wall of the supraglottic larynx
with mild
epiglottic fold thickening. No discrete mass identified.
2. Left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.

repeat laryngoscopy
[**4-21**] epiglottis normal, inward collapse of soft tissues stable,
vocal cords mobile bilaterally, patent airway. persistant
arytenoid edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 109248**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o woman with CAD, afib, CHF, PVD, ischemic
colitis, recently admitted for CHF exacerbation who is
presenting with cough and found to have a CT scan of the neck
concerning for near complete tracheal obstruction.

#ENT/airway: Ms. [**Known lastname 109248**] was never dyspneic and had no stridor on
exam.  She was admitted to the ICU and treated with IV decadron
10mg x 3 and observed overnight.  She did well.  She had an MRI
of the neck (reported above) which showed no upper airway
obstruction.  She had a repeat fiberoptic exam with no airway
obstruction (exam detailed above).  It was felt that her CT scan
was likely either an artifact from her carotid arteries or a
technical problem.
Of note she had a Left upper lobe nodule in her lung on CT and
MRI that should be followed up.

#Acute on chronic renal failure: baseline Cr 2-2.3. now up to
2.6. Likely prerenal
she was gently hydrated and her creatinine returned to 2.4.

#CHF: h/o CHF w/ EF 30-40%.
Initially the team held her diuretics due to her acute on
chronic renal failure.  Her chest x-ray did show increased
pulmonary edema.  Her diuretics should be continued on discharge
as her creatinine normalized

#Afib: She was given short acting metoprolol; rate was well
controlled on this regimen.  Initially warfarin was held as
concern for bleeding during a possible biopsy was raised.  Her
warfarin was restarted after her MRI.

#CAD: Initially her aspirin was held as concern for biopsy and
bleeding were raised.  After her MRI and second fiberoptic exam
were less concerning her asa was restarted.  BB was continued.
