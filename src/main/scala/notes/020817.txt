Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for hypoxic respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2146-9-8**]; extubated at [**Hospital1 18**] MICU
on [**2146-9-9**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4887**] is a 57y/o gentleman with right-sided hemiparesis and
aphasia s/p CVA, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after
hypoxic episode at his nursing home.

He has a history of MVA/TBI/L craniotomy 18 years ago, with
subsequent temproparietal CVA with right sided residual weakness
& expressive aphasia.  Despite his deficits he had lived alone
in [**State **] for many years, refusing assistance, until 1 year
ago when he had frequent falls at home.  His family brougt him
to [**Location (un) 86**] and he has been at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] nursing home.  He
has been agitated and at baseline he can only respond "yes,"
"no," or "come on," appropriately for the most part.

He has had seizures since the CVA (unclear type and duration);
he was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2146-8-27**] after he had a
witnessed seizure with aspiration.  He was intubated (compicated
by epiglottitis requiring steroids) and received IV Levofloxacin
which was transitioned to IV Unasyn; he was extubated and d/c'd
home on [**2146-9-6**].  On [**2146-9-8**] he was noted to be in respiratory
distress, and was hypoxic to the 80's on room air, to low 90s on
8L NC.  He was taken to [**Hospital3 **], given Ceftaz, was
intubated, and brought to [**Hospital1 1388**] MICU for further management.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS were notable for AF with RVR in the
130s with SBPs in the 70s-80s. He received vancomycin and
neosynephrine as well as sedation with fentanyl and midazolam; a
right femoral CVL was placed. He spontaneously converted to NSR
in the 50s. CXR shows LLL and LUL PNA with a 5-6 cm opacity in
the left main.  Vital signs: P 52 BP 105/61 RR 14 Sat 100 on
vent. He was given Fentanyl Citrate, Vancomycin, Phenylephrine,
Midazolam.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobar consolidation with bilateral small pleural

most likely due to an infectious etiology.
2. Multiple left-sided posterior rib deformities, chronic in
appearance.

[**2146-9-9**] TTE

IMPRESSION:
1.Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, left
greater than
right. Patchy areas of opacification at the left base could
represent a
superimposed infection.
2. Possible linear liver laceration in the right lobe, although
this is
incompletely assessed on the current study.
**Spoke with Radiologist - does not appear to be acute liver
pathology. Is likely related to prior trauma.**


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4887**] is a 57y/o gentleman with seizures s/p MVA/CVA, with
aspiration event requiring intubation ~1 week ago, who was
transferred here after hypoxic respiratory failure that was
likely due to mucus plug vs. aspiration event in the setting of
nursing home/recent hospital visit.

#. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
His hypoxic episode could certainly have been due to mucus plug
(considering the acute onset and acute resolution of symptoms
post-intubation), but repeat aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis
was also possible.  TTE ruled out cardiac causes for his
hypoxemia.  Given his recent hospital stay and at nursing home,
he was covered for healthcare-associated pneumonia.  When he
arrived, he was intubated and sedated on Midezolam and Fentanyl,
which was weaned off when the patient was extubated on [**2146-9-10**].
 At the time of extubation, he was transitioned to face tent
without incident, and then he was brought to the medicine floor
on [**2146-9-9**] on room air.  His O2 saturations were consistently in
the mid-to-high 90's.  He did have a few episodes of witnessed
coughing/difficulty clearing secretions, but his O2 sat never
dropped and he never had increased work of breathing.  He might
benefit from frequent suctioning while at nursing home.

#. Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia
The patient had frequent coughing, and CXR showed LLL
consolidation vs atelectasis, with L>R pleural effusions.  He
was initially started on antibiotics broadly with Vancomycin,
Ciprofloxacin, Cefepime, and Flagyl, but he was only continued
on Vancomycin and Cefepime.  He had been on a prednisone taper
at the OSH for epiglottitis, but this was unknown at the time,
so steroids were not continued (there were no signs/symptoms of
steroid withdrawal/adrenal insufficiency).  Thus, his initial
leukocytosis was likely due in large part to the steroids
received at OSH and at home, rather than due solely to
infection.  Off steroids and on antibiotics, his WBC decreased
from 31.8 on admission to 5.3 upon discharge.  He remained
afebrile throughout admission, and he never had increased work
of breathing.  His respiratory status is stable; sputum culture
[**9-10**] was consistent with oropharyngeal flora, and blood cultures
remained negative.  The patient has received 7/8 days of
anibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime) and was sent back to nursing home
with PICC line to complete his last day.

#. Seizure disorder s/p CVA
Unclear about prior #of seizures, but he last had a seizure
before his initial aspiration that brought him to [**Hospital1 **]. No seizure activity in house.  He was continued on his
home dose of Dilantin (corrected Phenytoin level was 15.3,
therapeutic).  He has follow-up with the Neurologist that saw
him at [**Hospital3 **].

#. CVA s/p MVA/TBI with right hemiparesis/expressive aphasia
Patient has permanent RUE and RLE weakness, and expressive
aphasia.  Per his brother [**Name (NI) 1158**], at baseline the patient is only
able to say "Yes, No, and come on."  He underwent Speech and
Swallow evaluation once he was on the Mecical floor, and he was
cleared to eat regular diet.  He is back at baseline in terms of
his mental status at the time of discharge.

#. Urine culture showing ~1000/mL GNR
The patient had a urine culture showing ~1000/mL GNR.  A few
days after admission, records obtained from [**Hospital1 **] demonstrated
ESBL E.coli cultured on [**2146-9-8**]
