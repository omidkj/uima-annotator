Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**]
Chief Complaint:
Elevated Cr, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with h/o Parkinsons, HTN, and worsening renal failure
who presents with w/ K>6, Cr 4 from NH. a few days ago at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab, he spiked a fever to 102. No night sweats or recent
weight loss or gain. Denies headache, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Positive cough productive of white phlegm. Patient also reports
that he has had DOE and shortness of breath for the last 6
weeks. He does not know whether this has changed recently.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea,
vomiting but developed diarrhea today. Patient states that he
has had constipation on and off and he was given something at
his rehab today to get his bowels moving. Then this afternoon he
devloped loose stools. The patient also c/o abdominal distention
which is not new. The patient also complains of chronic low back
pain radiating to the groin which is similar to the pain he had
on last admission when a compression fx was discovered. The
patient also states that he has had decreased PO intake over the
last week. He states that he has not felt hungry and "everything
tastes wrong"
.
The patient was recently admitted with worsening low back pain.
CT and plain films revealed a compression fracture. MRI spine
showed no evidence of epidural abscess, cord compression, osteo.
But may have acute compression of vertebrae causing pain. Pain
control was with tylenol standing, morphine prn, calcitonin
nasal spray. Patient with significant SOB and new oxygen
requirement that was thought [**2-20**] CHF exacerbation. CXR showed
atelectasis vs. PNA and evidence of CHF. The team held
Amiodarone in this patient as Amiodarone toxicity was thought to
possibly be contributing to his shortness of breath and hypoxia.
He was also treated for pneumonia given possible infiltrate in
gentleman with no clear source for fever, he was afebrile after
day one of admission. Echo during hospital stayed showed
decreased EF to 30% - 35% from 40% in [**Month (only) 404**]. He was
significantly volume overloaded on initial exam, with edema,
crackles and evidence of pulm edema and diuresed throughout the
admission.
.
In the ED today, EKG showed old AV delay, old LBBB, no TW
peaking.
CBC/chem revealed an AG of 16, elevated WBC. CEs showed an
elevated troponin but this is in the setting of ARF. MB was
flat. Guaiac test of stool was positive in setting of loose
stools. CXR/KUB -> bowel loops herniating to thorax but no
obstruction.

.
CXR [**12-11**]: Portable upright chest radiograph reviewed. Again
seen is a complex hiatal hernia containing stomach and bowel
loops. Evaluation of the heart size is thus limited. The lungs
are grossly clear though limited secondary to large hernia. The
right costophrenic angle is sharp. The left costophrenic angle
is obscured by mediastinal contour secondary to hernia. The
pulmonary vessels are within normal limits.
.
EKG: NSR rate 83, 1st degree AV block, LAD, LBBB
.
Renal U/S [**12-11**]: The right kidney measures 8.6 cm. The left
kidney measures 8.4 cm. Again seen are two right renal cysts.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or mass. The
distended bladder is unremarkable.
.
CT head [**12-11**]: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
Hypodensities in the periventricular and deep cerebral white
matter consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation is preserved. Prominence of the
ventricles and sulci is consistent with brain atrophy. There are
bilateral basal ganglia calcifications. Extensive carotid
calcifications are also identified. Surrounding osseous and soft
tissue structures are unremarkable.
.
Urine Cytology- [**2194-12-22**] **atypical urothelial cells.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2194-12-22**] 11:15 AM
The study was performed in conjunction with the speech
pathologist. Various consistencies of barium were administered
to the patient under video fluoroscopy. Aspiration was
demonstrated with consecutive straw sips of thin liquids. The
patient had a spontaneous, ineffective cough. After the first
sip of thin liquids, a small amount of penetration was also
noted which was stripped out by the patient. Please see the
speech pathologist's report in CareWeb for more details and
treatment recommendations.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1395**] is a pleasant and witty [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with h/o
Parkinsons, HTN, and worsening renal failure who presented with
a potassium of >6, Cr 4 from his nursing home. On admission he
developing worsening dyspnea requiring MICU transfer and around
the clock nebulizer treatments. He was never intubated and only
required 2L oxygen for mild hypoxia, and was transferred to the
general medical floor for management. It was thought severe
reflux and his very large paraesophageal hernia were primarily
related to his episode of dyspnea. The patient sustained an
NSTEMI and revealed worsening LV systolic function to 25% EF.
Coronary revascularization was not recommended given the
patient's episode of GI bleeding with heparinization and
baseline poor functional status. His medical therapies were
maximized from cardiac, renal and pulmonary perspectives.

#. Shortness of breath: No evidence of CHF or PNA on CXR.
Patient's lung exam + for wheezes. Does no appear overloaded on
pulmonary exam, however his significant lower extremity edema
was likely secondary to decreased oncotic pressures due to
nutritional depletion/low albumin. Given IV steroids and
nebulizers initially q30min but nebs were spaced to q2hours then
q4hours prn.  Unfortunately patient had to relapsing episodes of
dyspnea requiring increased frequency in nebul
