Chief Complaint:
fever, cough, chest pain

Reason for ICU admission: SIRS/pneumonia, early sepsis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o female, resident of nursing home, with post-inflammatory
pulmonary fibrosis following her episode of severe ARDS,
interstitial lung disease with pulmonary hypertension, multiple
sclerosis (on prednisone), inflammatory polyarthritis,
osteoporosis with multiple lumbar compression fractures, and
frequent bouts of pneumonia, who presents with one day of cough,
fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and green sputum.
Associated symptoms included nausea with dry heaves and one
loose stool.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.8, HR 96, BP 132/95, RR 16, O2
95% 4L NC. She was felt to "look toxic" with a respiratory rate
in the mid to upper 20s. She was responsive, alert, and coughing
up green sputum at the bedside, but appeared tired. Her JVP was
flat, with dry MM. Pulmonary exam notable for diffuse rales.
Cardiac exam felt to be normal. There was some concern for
cellulitis on her right ankle.
.
CXR initially read as poor inspiratory effort and difficult to
interpret, ?atelectasis vs. RML opacity. EKG was felt to be
unremarkable. Patient received 2L IVF, linezolid, aztreonam, and
levofloxacin for HCAP, coverage of MRSA and pseudomonas, and
given her numerous allergies.
.
Vitals on transfer: 99.8, 105/51, 84, 20, 98% 4L NC. Access: 18G
and 20G.
.
On the floor, patient reports chest pressure with deep
inspiration and coughing. She denies SOB.
.

[**10-21**] Radiology:
[**2147-10-21**] AP CXR - IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes and chronic
interstitial lung disease. Mild right middle lobe opacity may
represent a focal pneumonia.
Rotated positioning. Allowing for this, there is no definite
change compared with [**2147-10-22**]. There is equivocal slight
increase in the degree of opacity in both upper zones, but this
is likely accentuated by differences in technique. IMPRESSION:
No definite change. A subtle difference might not be appreciated
due to differences in positioning and technique.
.
CXR 10/31Rotated positioning. Allowing for this, there is no
definite change compared with [**2147-10-22**]. There is equivocal
slight increase in the degree of opacity in both upper zones,
but this is likely accentuated by differences in technique.
IMPRESSION: No definite change. A subtle difference might not be

.
[**10-25**] CXR-FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
patient has received a right-sided PICC line. The tip of the
PICC line projects over the right atrium, the line should be
pulled back by approximately 3 cm.
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.

The pre-existing parenchymal opacities have slightly decreased
in severity and extent. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 84 y/o female, resident of nursing home,
with post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung
disease, multiple sclerosis (on prednisone), inflammatory
polyarthritis, and frequent bouts of pneumonia, who presented
with one day of cough, fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and
green sputum.
.
# SIRS/early sepsis/pneumonia: given her history of frequent
bouts of pneumonia with current [**Numeric Identifier **] of fever, chills,
cough, green sputum, elevated WBC, and CXR with suspicion of RML
infiltrate, strongly suspected pneumonia. Given her nursing home
residence and two recent admissions for pneumonia, favor
antibiotic coverage for HCAP. She did report pleuritic chest
pain, for which PE was also on the differential, however this is
felt to
