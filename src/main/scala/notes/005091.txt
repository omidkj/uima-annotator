HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman
with cardiac risk factors of smoking and age, and no cardiac
history, who presented to an outside hospital for substernal
chest pressure, which awoke her this morning from sleep.  She
describes the pain as knife like and sharp without radiation,
but associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis rated
[**9-4**], no associated shortness of breath.  No back or
abdominal pain.  Patient activated EMS and was taken to
[**Hospital1 **] at which ECG demonstrated anterior ST elevations.
Her initial laboratories are unremarkable and chest x-ray was
consistent with congestive heart failure.  She was treated
with aspirin, Heparin drip, nitroglycerin drip, and Morphine,
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for cardiac catheterization.

Coronary angiography demonstrated severe left main, two
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a proximal 80%
stenosis.  The LAD had a thrombotic 100% proximal occlusion
and RCA had a 50% ostial stenosis.  The LAD was a 3 x 13 mm
Hepakote stent and the left main was stented with a 3.5 x 8
mm Cypher stent.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated evidence
of elevated right sided filling pressures and decreased
cardiac index.

Integrilin was initially held secondary to history of
prior stroke and bleeding, but was given after
initiating complex left main stent procedure. An intra-aortic
balloon pump was not placed due to history of abdominal aortic
aneurysm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hemorrhagic CVA in 10/00.
2. Abdominal aortic aneurysm of 6.5 cm on pyelogram on [**1-25**].
3. Renal cancer status post resection.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:  Multivitamin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 150/94,
pulse 81, respirations 22, and sating 92% on room air.
General:  Well-developed and well-nourished in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Chest:  Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  Cor:  Regular, distant
heart sounds, normal S1, S2, no rub or gallop appreciated.
Positive JVD, no bruits.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm
and well perfused, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Hematoma on the right groin.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II
through XII intact.  Moves all four extremities.

LABORATORIES:  White count 10.2, hematocrit 38.2, platelets
210.  Sodium 134, potassium 4.6, chloride 104, bicarb 20, BUN
19, creatinine 1.1, and glucose of 164.  AST 345, ALT 53,
alkaline phosphatase 119, and total bilirubin 0.5.  CK peak
4488, CK MB 494, troponin-T 24.8.

EKG post intervention, sinus rhythm at 84, Q waves in V1, V2,
and V3 with persistent ST elevation, improved from prior,
poor R-wave progression, T-wave inversion in V1 through V3,
aVL, normal axis, and no left ventricular hypertrophy.

Chest x-ray:  Pulmonary edema, overlying emphysema.

Echocardiogram:  Normal left atrium, normal left ventricular
wall thickness and cavity size.  Moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of
30-40%, apical akinesis, hypokinesis of the mid and distal
anterior wall and hypokinesis of the anterior septum, mid and
distal inferior walls, moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ST elevation MI:  The patient's CK had peaked at admission
at 4488.  Postcatheterization, she was treated with aspirin,
Plavix, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and a statin.  She had no
recurrent chest pain throughout her hospitalization.  She will
need a relook angiography in three months to evaluate her LMCA
stent. Echocardiogram demonstrated systolic dysfunction with an
ejection fraction of approximately 30%, focal hypokinesis.
Patient was diuresed for her congestive heart failure and did
well.

It was felt that anticoagulation was not indicated in this
patient despite her poor ejection fraction and akinesis,
secondary to bleeding risk.  The patient did have one
episode of hematemesis while on Integrilin as well as a right
groin hematoma.  Her hematocrit was followed serially and
required transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells.

2. Abdominal aortic aneurysm:  Patient is not a surgical
candidate at this time.  This may be followed up on an
outpatient setting.

3. Pulmonary:  The patient was in obvious failure responding
to diuresis, however, there seemed to be a component of COPD
which may be exacerbating her oxygen requirements.  Pulmonary
function tests were obtained prior to discharge to be
followed up by her primary care provider.

4. Renal:  The patient had acute renal failure.  This was
felt secondary to large dye load received while undergoing
cardiac catheterization.  This did trend down and finally
trended down prior to discharge.  Discharge plan - Will be
followed up as an outpatient.

5. Smoking cessation:    The patient was
counseled to quit smoking tobacco.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2. Congestive Heart Failure

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Metoprolol XL 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Bupropion one tablet p.o. q.d. x3 days, then one tablet
p.o. b.i.d. thereafter.
6. Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingual prn.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1655**],
her cardiologist on [**8-17**] and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8049**] on
[**8-13**].  The patient will need re-catheterization
three months after discharge.
