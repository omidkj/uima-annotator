Date of Birth:  [**2135-2-7**]             Sex:   F

Service: EMERGENCY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure, hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
trans-esophageal echocardiogram
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
31yoF w/ h/o DM1, HTN, s/p left sided hemorrhagic CVA (3 yrs
ago) s/p trach/PEG/chronically indwelling catheter presents to
ED from [**Hospital **] rehab today after having had witnessed "tonic
clonic" activity at which time her BS was found to be 30.  NH
staff had also noted decreased alertness today prior to her
seizure activity and hypoglycemia.  She has reportedly been
spiking temps since [**7-8**] at rehab.  In review of her med list,
she was started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin and inhaled
tobramycin on [**7-10**] (planned for 2 wk course); abx were changed
from levaquin/vanco when sputum grew cipro resistant klebsiella
(sensitive to ceftriaxone).
.
Of note, pt. was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 6957**] for sepsis
(presumed pulmonary source).  Course was c/b probable VAP and
she is s/p tracheostomy recannulation during last
hospitalization as well as s/p PEG placement as she had been
having increasing dysphagia at home.  Also during this past
hospitalization, she was noted to be persistently febrile
without clear e/o of persistet infection and in the absence of
clear medication causes.
.
In the ED, initial VS revealed T 101.6 BP 110/71 HR 100 RR 20 O2
sat 100% on AC (Vt 450, rr 14, FiO2 0.60, PEEP 5).  A CXR was
obtained and did not show e/o infiltrate.  UA showed moderate
bacteria, but only 0-2 WBCs and she has a chronic indwelling
foley.  She received ceftriaxone and vancomycin in addition to
approximately 2L IV NS.
.
ROS:  Unable to obtain from patient

Pertinent Results:
[**2166-7-12**] CXR:  wet read without clear evidence of infiltrate.
.
[**2166-7-13**] sputum: sparse coag +staph = MRSA. S: gen, rifampin,
tetracycline, bactrim, vanco; R: clinda, erythromycin,
penicillin, and oxicillin
.
[**7-13**], [**7-14**], [**7-15**] stool neg. for c. diff
.
[**7-14**] UCx: yeasts > 100K
.
[**2166-7-15**] UA: +yeasts, mod leuk, no bact
.
[**2166-7-15**] EEG: This is a mildly abnormal portable EEG in the waking
and
drowsy states due to the disorganized and poorly sustained
background. There was no clear electrographic correlate for
clinically observed episodes of eye fluttering or leg tremor.
There were no clearly focal, lateralized, or epileptiform
features noted. There were no electrographic seizures.
.
[**2166-7-16**] CT head: no significant change since [**2166-6-27**]. no new IC
bleed or infarct
.
[**2166-7-16**] CT abd/ pelvis: pneumonic infiltrate of RLL, no
perinephric abscess, 4.5cm soft tissue mass in R breast (rec f/u
with US)
.
[**2166-7-18**] CT head: no significant interval change. no new IC bleed
.
[**2166-6-12**] Echo:  LVEF 30-40% [**1-10**] to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of
the apical half of the left ventricle, mild pulmonary htn.
.
[**2166-7-19**] Echo: Mild mitral leaflet thickening but without
discrete vegetation or pathologic flow. Low normal left
ventricular systolic function.  Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2166-6-12**], left ventricular systolic
function is improved with lack of regional dysfunction. The
focal thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet was also present
on review of the prior study.
.
[**2166-7-20**] MRI/MRA: IMPRESSION:
1.  Severe bilateral athermatous disease of the intracranial
internal carotid arteries.
2.  Similar  encephalomalacic changes in the left frontal lobe.
3.  Extensive T2 signal abnormality in the cerebral white
matter, probably due to widespread chronic small vessel
infarction.
4.  Marked brain atrophy.
5.  No evidence of brain abscess or abnormal meningeal
enhancement.
.
[**2166-7-25**] RLE US: neg for DVT
.
[**2166-7-28**] CT head/ sinus: IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance of
cystic encephalomalacia and other atrophic
changes in the brain.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. Clear sinuses.
.
[**2166-7-28**] CT chest/ abd/ pelvis: CONCLUSION:
1.  Interval improvement in extent of right lower lobe
atelectasis, and development of small airspace opacity, that may
represent pneumonia vs. reexpansion changes.
2.  Right lower lobe airspace consolidation, likely representing
atelectasis, underlying infection cannot be entirely excluded.
3.  Arteriosclerosis.
4.  No drainable fluid collection.
.
[**2166-7-30**] EEG: intermittent sharp wave, as well as spike and slow
wave discharges, seen in a multifocal fashion arising sometimes
in a generalized distribution but also were seen independently
in the bifrontal regions and the left temporal region. Also
noted were broad-based, high amplitude, blunted triphasic waves
in the region of the left anterior temporal and temporal
regions. Discharges were not repetitive and there were no
electrographic seizures noted. These multifocal regions of
discharges suggest areas of cortical irritability with potential
for epileptogenesis.
Also persistent slowing over the left temporal regions in the
setting of a persistent slow and disorganized background. The
slowing over the left hemisphere - subcortical dysfunction. The
otherwise slow and disorganized background rhythm suggests a
more global
and diffuse process consistent with an encephalopathy likely due
to
deeper midline or bilateral subcortical dysfunction.
Medications,
metabolic disturbances, infections, and anoxia are among the
most common causes of encephalopathy.

[**2166-7-30**] TEE: could not be done as probe could not be passed
.
[**2166-7-31**] TTE: could not be done as study is technically difficult
- no additional information would be provided from previous
.
[**2166-8-1**] EGD:
.
[**2166-8-1**] GJ tube exchange
.
[**2166-8-3**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1.  Multifocal pneumonia with new left upper lobe and lingular
infiltrates and no significant change to left lower lobe air
bronchogram containing infiltrate.  Near complete resolution of
previously identified patchy right lower lobe opacities.  No
evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
2.  Unchanged atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and
its branches as well as the coronary circulation much more
prominent than expected for patient's age.
.
[**2166-8-3**] Bronchoscopy:
LLL and RLL with some purulent secretions.  no evidence of
bronchial obstruction.  Sent LLL BAL.
.
[**8-7**] Bilat LE u/s:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in both lower extremities.
.
[**8-5**] Trans esophageal echo
Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. A very small secundum
atrial septal defect is present. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal
