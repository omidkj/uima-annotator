Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Wheezing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo man with history of GERD s/p fundoplication,
HTN, Charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-Tooth disease who presents to the Emergency
Department with worsening shortness of breath. Patient states
that for the past 2-3 weeks he has had worsening shortness of
breath. Patient describes this as wheezing which can last
'through the night'. These episodes can occur when walking to
the bathroom or at rest. He has never had wheezing before. He
denies any recent, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
radiating pain, peripheral edema, PND, orthopnea. He does sleep
with 2+ pillows but he does this for his GERD. He also denies
any recent abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, urinary frequency.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.1, HR 53, BP 165/93, RR 24.
Patient was given ASA 325 mg, NS IVF at 100cc/hr. Patient had an
acute episode of hypoxia requirng BIPAP. He was given Solumedrol
125 mg IV, Levaquin 750 mg, Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV.  ECG done which
showed ? q waves in V1,V2. Cardiac biomarkers were drawn and
Troponin-T was elevated at 0.34 with normal CK of 62. Heparin
gtt was started for concern of acute coronary syndrome. Patient
sent for CTA, which was negative for pulmonary embolus, but
showed ? bibasilar consolidations consistent with aspiration vs
atelectasis. Patient then went into atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response and was given diltiazem 10 mg IV x 1
then started on a diltiazem gtt. He ws also given Lopressor 5 mg
IV without resolution of tachycardia. Lasix 10 mg IV also given
in ED. Patient required BIPAP for 1 hour in ED and was then
placed on face tent O2.

Micro
Blood cultures x 4, urine cx, sputum cx no growth

EKG: Irregular rate and rhythm, T wave flattening I-III. T wave
inversions V1-V5.  qwaves V1-V2.

CXR [**2198-2-8**]
Study is limited by lordotic positioning. Heart size is within
normal limits given technique. The mediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Lungs are
clear. No effusion or pneumothorax detected however the extreme
left costophrenic angle not included on this radiograph.
Numerous surgical clips are present within the upper abdomen
from nissen procedure.

CTA Chest [**2198-2-8**]
  No thoracic aortic dissection is identified. No filling
defects within the pulmonary arteries to suggest acute pulmonary
embolism. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary,
mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes per CT size criteria. A small
pericardial effusion is present. Moderate coronary artery
calcifications.
  Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates bibasilar consolidations,
right greater than left with impacted endobronchial secretions
and peribronchial thickening. A trace left pleural effusion is
noted.
  Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited; however, evidence
of a laparoscopic Nissen with multiple surgical clips noted.
There is herniation of the proximal portion of the laparoscopic
Nissen consistent with a small hernia.
  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified. At the
T11/T12 vertebral bodies, there is severe intervertebral body
disc space narrowing and vacuum phenomenon. Significant
sclerosis of these vertebral bodies present with erosion at the
endplates.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2198-2-18**]
  There is a trace pericardial effusion vs. pericardial
thickening that is unchanged from the recent CTA of the chest of
[**2-8**]. There remains evidence of bibasilar aspiration, with
patchy bibasilar opacities, flecks of barium in the medial right
lower lobe, and bronchial wall thickening. Opacities have
actually improved since [**2-8**]. The small herniation of the
laparoscopic Nissen at the thorax is unchanged from [**2-8**]
as well.
  Images in the abdomen and pelvis are degraded by streak
artifact due to high-density material in the colon, and due to
multiple clips near the gastroesophageal junction. The
non-contrast appearance of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. The spleen is mildly enlarged,
measuring about 14.1 cm in diameter.
  Kidney and urologic evaluation is quite limited for technical
reasons already described. There is no hydronephrosis. No
calculi are seen in the kidneys.
  No mass lesions are detected, though the evaluation is
incomplete without IV contrast. The stomach is moderately
distended. Small bowel loops are unremarkable. Barium is
retained throughout the colon. No free air or free fluid in the
abdomen is visualized. Air is seen in the left anterior
abdominal wall subcutaneous tissues, possibly related to
injection. Hyperdense material is seen in the musculature of the
left paramedian anterior abdominal wall, possibly representing
calcified suture. Inside the left anterior abdomen there is a
tubular dense structure just anterior to the stomach oriented in
a craniocaudal direction, which may represent a calcified
vessel.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Detail is markedly
obscured due to streak artifact from bowel contrast. There is a
Foley catheter within the bladder, and air within the bladder
likely related to instrumentation. There are calcifications in
the prostate, mild. The rectum is filled with stool and is
otherwise unremarkable. No free fluid in the pelvis, and no
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: There are advanced degenerative changes of the
lum
