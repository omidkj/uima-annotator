Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line


History of Present Illness:
88yo F PMhx CHF, HTN presenting w AMS in the setting of a fall.
1d prior to presentation, patient was getting out of bathtub
when she slipped; this was an observed fall by the patient's
VNA; no head strike, no LOC. Patient reports she initially felt
fine, and refused to go to the ED at that time. On day of
admisison, family reported that patient sounded confused over
the phone, acting "sleepy". Patient denied fevers, chills,
nausea/vomitting, cough, motor/sensory deficits; reported pain
over her L ribs from her fall. Patient's family brought her to
the ED for further evaluation.
.
On presentation to the ED, initial vital signs were 99.4 60
117/45 20 92%. Exam was remarkable for hematoma over L rib,
atraumatic head, mild abdominal tenderness; labs were
significant or WBC 5.9, Hct 34.7, platelets 122, ALT 44, AST 80,
BNP 3244, Cr 1.9, UA wnl, trop .03; CXR unremarkable, RUQ u/s
unremarkable, CT unremarkable; while in the ED patient spiked
fever to 101.3. Blood cx were sent and patient was given
vancomycin/zosyn and was admitted to medicine for further
management. At time of transfer, vital signs were 98.9 61 142/63
20 100%3L.
.
On arrival to the floor vital signs were 99.9 160/75 59 18
93%2L. On further questioning patient reported increased SOB and
constipation; denied headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea,
congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, , BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2173-8-14**]
1. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles; while could relate
to overlying soft tissue, but trace pleural effusions or pleural
thickening not excluded.
2. Possible minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.
.
Echo [**2173-8-17**]
The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-3-9**], the
severity of aortic stenosis is similar.
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND ([**8-19**]): [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale
and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained.
Evaluation of the calf veins was limited due to patient body
habitus. However, there is normal flow, compressibility, and
augmentation of the above examined veins.
IMPRESSION: No DVT.
.
CHEST CT ([**8-19**]):FINDINGS:
The airways are patent to the segmental level. Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is longstanding measuring up to 30 x 12 mm in
the right upper posterior
paratracheal station, 11 mm right lower paratracheal station, 12
mm in the AP window. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is severe
calcification of the aortic valve and mitral annulus. There are
also severe/dense atherosclerotic calcifications in all coronary
arteries. Pacemaker leads are in standard position. There is no
pericardial effusion. The aorta is normal in caliber with
moderate calcifications in the ascending aorta and aortic arch.

There are small bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
Multifocal areas of lung consolidation in the upper lobes, left
greater than right, lingula, are most likely infectious in
etiology with a component of pulmonary edema given the fact that
there is mild interlobular septal thickening and ground-glass
opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally. In the lower lobes
bilaterally bibasilar consolidations are associated with loss of
volume in the left lower lobe and small bilateral nonhemorrhagic
pleural effusions.
A calcified small lung nodule in the right lobe, which is
stable.
Other previously described lung nodules are obscured by lung
opacities.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. A
subcentimeter hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the liver
(2:45) is
unchanged, too small to be characterized. There is a small
hiatal hernia.
There are no bone findings of malignancy. There is a vertebral
hemangioma in L1.
IMPRESSION:
Multifocal pneumonia, small bilateral pleural effusion. There is
also a
minimal component of interstitial edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
88yo F PMHx CHF, HTN presented initially with pneumonia, s/p
fall with fevers to 103 and worsening pulmonary edema, required
ICU admission for BiPap. Fared well with broad spectrum
antibiotics and diuresis.
