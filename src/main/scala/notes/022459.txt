History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82188**] is a 50 yo M with PMH of HTN, IDDM1 x >20 years, ESRD
s/p fistula placement who presented to the ED with vomiting
since this morning. According to the Pt, he was in his usual
state of health until yesterday evening when he ate a Chinese
food meal of shrimp fried rice. He reported that a few hours
later he began to feel nauseous and had multiple episodes of
vomiting. He describes the vomiting as non-bloody, and
non-bilious. He denies associated fevers, chills, diarrhea, or
shortness of breath. He checked a FS and noted it to be over 300
which he says is normal for him. He went to bed and in the
morning he continued to feel nauseous with vomiting, despite
drinking ginger ale and tea. He then decided to proceed to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. He denies recent sick contacts, alcohol ingestion, and
chest pain. He admits to recent medication non-compliance. He
states that typically is FS are in the 300s, and that they are
over 500 on average "a few times per week."

In the ED, initial ED VS 98.0, 203/94, 95, 18 and 100/RA.
Physical exam notable for clear lungs but mild diffuse
tenderness. An insulin gtt was started with initial 10U bolus
and 7U/hr. He was given Zofran 4 mg IV x 1. VS on transfer 97.4,
93, 185/83, 28, 97/3L. He was noted to have a K of 6.4 and EKG
showed peaked T-waves. He was given calcium chloride, and
admitted to the MICU.

CXR [**2180-4-29**]:
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
Bibasilar airspace opacities are seen, concerning for infectious
process. Findings could also relate to interstitial edema and
clinical correlation is advised. There is a small left pleural
effusion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aorta is
tortuous.

CXR [**2180-4-30**]: PA and Lateral:
Compared to the prior study there is a more focal patchy feature
at the right lung base and the retrocardiac region appears
denser. These findings are most consistent with an evolving
pneumonia in the anterior segment of the right lower lobe. There
is less distension of the interstitial markings suggesting a
slight improvement in fluid status although there are bilateral
effusions. Cardiomegaly is unchanged versus prior.
IMPRESSION: Evolving airspace disease at the anterior segment of
the right lower lobe which could be pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting. Diminished but persistent features of CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo male with DM type I, HTN, ESRD presents with n/v, found to
be in DKA, s/p ICU admission for insulin drip.  Anion gap
closed, now at 10.
.
#. DKA - Patient is poorly controlled type I diabetic.  Found to
have an anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonuria on admission.
 Originally admitted to the MICU for insulin drip.  His anion
gap closed and he was transitioned to insulin sliding scale.
Uncertain what precipitated this episode of DKA, possibly
gastroenteritis or pneumonia.  Patient was continued on lantus
14 units qhs with humalog sliding scale as per his outpatient
regimen.
.
#. ESRD - patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**].  He is s/p L
fistula placement but was not amenable to HD on admission.
After transfer to the floor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**] had a discussion with
him after which he decided to initiate HD.  HD was started on
[**2180-4-30**].  Patient had PPD placed on [**2180-5-1**] on his RUE which was
read as negative on [**2180-5-3**].  Patient received 3 sessions of HD
prior to discharge.  He will continue HD as an outpatient on a
Tues, Thurs, Saturday schedule.
.
#. Hypertension - patient was contined on carvedilol and
furosemide.  Can consider
