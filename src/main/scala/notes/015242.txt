CT chest w/o contrast:
1. Interval worsening of the centrilobular and peribronchial
ground-glass opacities of the lung bases which is more prominent
at the left lung base.
2. Unchanged paucity of vascular markings particularly at the
lung bases consistent with pulmonary hypertension and emphysema.
3. Unchanged appearance of extensive mass-like fibrosis of the
central parahilar and apical portions of the lungs with
associated volume loss and architectural distortion consistent
with end-stage fibrosis from the pulmonary sarcoid.
4. Stable calcified central sarcoid-induced adenopathy.
5. Inreasing small left pleura effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 5903**] is a 71-year-old woman with severely obstructive
COPD from sarcoidosis who presented in respiratory distress. The
following issues were addressed during her hospital stay:
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
Patient with stage IV sarcoidoisis with obstructive and
restrictive lung disease. Patient had stopped steroid taper ~ 10
days ago and subsequently developed progressive breathing
difficulty most likely related to flare of her underlying
disease. Admission ABG showed marked hypercapnea. She was placed
on BiPAP overnight  in ICU with significant subjective and
objective improvement in breathing.  She did require Bipap
during the day in the first few days of her admission, but this
was titrated down to nasal cannula (3L) and she tolerated this
well for 48 hours prior to discharge.  No new infiltrate was
seen on CXR or on repeat CT scan although her sarcoidosis was
worse. Patient remained afebrile, with no leukocytosis or
productive cough. She completed a 5 day course of Azithromycin
for COPD flare.  Albuterol/Atrovent nebs were administerd
around-the-clock and should continue at rehab.  She was
administered parenteral steroids and transitioned quickly to PO
once off BiPAP mask during the day. She should be on very slow
steroid taper on discharge.  She should received 60 of
prednisone for five days ([**2152-1-17**]- [**2152-1-21**]), decreasing dose to
40mg Prednisone for five days ([**2152-1-22**]- [**2152-1-26**]), then 30mg
prednisone for 5 days ([**Date range (3) 94845**]), then 20mg prednisone
starting on [**2152-2-1**].  Any further taper to be directed by her
outpatient pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She has a follow up
appointment scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2152-1-31**] at 9:00 AM.
.
# GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE
Unmasked by steroid use. Fingersticks were checked QID and was
placed on RISS while on steroids.  She should continue this
while on steroids.
.
# HTN
Home Verapamil was added back and she tolerated this well.
.
# DIASTOLIC CHF
No evidence of failure clinically. She should continue on her
home lasix, 20mg PO every other day.
.
# PPX
- Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
- CaCO3 for osteoporosis
- PPI for GI PPx while on Steroids
- Pneumoboots for DVT PPx
.
# F/E/N
- low salt diet
- Replete lytes PRN
