History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo male s/p prolonged hospital and
rehabilitation course following XRT for [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma
who presents with acute onset shortness of breath at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab earlier today. Per report, oxygen saturation dropped to
84-85% on 4L NC from baseline in the mid 90's. He was
hypotensive with SBP's in the 80's, which resolved with IVF. Per
report from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, patient was noted to have new thick
brown sputum with difficulty swallowing. He was recently started
on levofloxacin/flagyl three days ago for treatment of a
presumed aspiration pneumonia.
.
Of note, he was admitted to NEBH in [**Month (only) 1096**] for ? pneumonia,
then discharged to rehab and readmitted for dyspnea and
hemoptysis. He was placed on BiPAP and later intubated with a
two-week course complicated by ARDS, ARF requiring temporary HD,
acute delirium, and thrombocytopenia. He was treated with a
steroid taper for COPD exacerbation and broad spectrum
antibiotics. He was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**1-29**].
Per his wife, he has made significant gains over the past month
while at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
.
On arrival to the ED, SpO2 95% on NRB, RR 32, HR 96, BP 121/47.
He received vancomycin 1 g IV, Cefepime 2 g IV, solumedrol 125
mg IV, and a combivent neb.

Reports:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-8**] 3:20 AM
AP PORTABLE CHEST: Heart size, mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. The aorta is mildly tortuous and there are
atherosclerotic calcifications of the arch. There is patchy
airspace consolidation at the right lung base which partially
obscures the hemidiaphragm consistent with right lower lobe
pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion on this radiograph that
does not fully include the right costophrenic sulcus. Left lung
is clear. No pneumothorax. The acromioclavicular joints appear
narrowed bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2190-3-8**]  3:20:30 AM
Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. Ventricular ectopy. Non-specific
inferior
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing the rate is
faster and
ectopy is present.
TRACING #1
.
ECG Study Date of [**2190-3-8**]  8:47:02 AM
Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. Non-specific inferior ST-T wave
changes.
Compared to the previous tracing ventricular ectopy is no longer
present.
TRACING #2
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-9**] 5:17 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-8**], there is poor
definition of the left hemidiaphragm with some increased
opacification suggesting atelectasis or pneumonia at the left
base. The right basilar opacification is again seen and probably
is of little change.
The upper lung zones are clear.
.
[**2190-3-9**] 2:07 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
CHEST, SUPINE PORTABLE: Comparison is made to earlier on the
same day. A new nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
However, the sidehole lies only immediately beyond the expected
site of the gastroesophageal junction. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal opacities are also
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: New nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach.
However, the tube could be advanced further in order to gain
greater purchase, as the side hole lies near the
gastroesophageal junction.
.
[**2190-3-9**] 4:26 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, there
is little change in the position of the nasogastric tube. The
side port remains in the region of the GE junction, and the tube
should be advanced 6-10 cm for optimal positioning.
Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
.
ECHO [**2190-3-9**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Ther
