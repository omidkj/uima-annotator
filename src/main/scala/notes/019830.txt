Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Bidirectional shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. Small secundum ASD with bidirectional flow is seen.

8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2164-12-18**] at 1030 am.

Post bypass

1. Patient in sinus rhythm.

2. LV systolic function was normal for 30 minutes after
separation from CPB. There was sudden onset of severe
hypotension with elevated PA pressures. At this time the
anterior wall, septum and anterior septum were extremely
hypokinetic. After resuscitation with epinephrine wall motion
improved. Now LV function is normal.

3. Aorta intact post decannulation.

4. Mild mitral regurgitation persists.

5. There is still bidirectional flow across the interatrial
septum.

6. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Valve
appears well seated and the leaflets move well. No aortic
insufficiency seen.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 76 year old female who presented to the ED with
chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  Workup revealed
aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.  Upon evaluation
for surgery, the patient was found to require dental
extractions.  This was performed on [**2164-12-16**].  The patient
recovered well from this and on [**2164-12-18**] she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass graft x 1.  Please see operative note for
further details.  Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure
well and postoperatively was transferred to the CVICU in good
condition for observation and recovery.  At this time she was on
levophed and epinephrine drips.  On POD 1, the patient was
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  She
remained on epinephrine for hypotension.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
transferred to the step down unit on POD 2.  She did develop
atrial fibrillation.  Amiodarone was started as well as
anticoagulation with coumadin.  The patient converted to sinus
rhythm.  Beta blocker was titrated as tolerated.  Oral
amiodarone was continued, and coumadin was discontinued.
Remainder of hospital course was uneventful.  The patient was
discharged to rehab on POD 6.
