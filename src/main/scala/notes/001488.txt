[**2-4**]
CT head: Right sided subarachnoid blood in temporal area
possibly
small contusion no mass effect or shift.

[**2-4**]
CT cervical spine:
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Degenerative changes including listhesis and mild loss of
height as
described above. These findings are age indeterminate given lack
of
comparison.

[**2-4**]
CXR
1. Moderate cardiomegaly.
2. No focal consolidation.

[**2-4**]
Hip xray
PELVIS, ONE VIEW; LEFT HIP, TWO VIEWS: There is diffuse osseous
demineralization. There are no fractures or dislocations.
Moderate
degenerative disease is noted in the lower lumbar spine.
Retained stool is noted in the rectum. The bowel gas pattern is
nonspecific.  The soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No fractures.

[**2-5**] Rpt head CT:

IMPRESSION:
1. No interval change in size or configuration of right temporal
and right
frontal vertex subarachnoid hemorrhage.

2. Punctate hyperdensity within the left cerebellum is too small
to fully
characterize, but may represent a calcification. Ill-defined
hyperdensity
along the tentorium on the left appears unchanged, possibly
chronic thickening or subtle focal subdural hematoma.

3. No new focus of hemorrhage. No mass effect or midline shift.

4. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
