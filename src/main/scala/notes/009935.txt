Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
Expidited pre-transplant workup for decompensated cirrhosis;
Maroon blood in colostomy bag

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Heart Catheterization
Upper Endoscopy
Ileoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91442**] is a pleasant 44 year old woman with a history of UC
s/p total colectomy, PSC diagnosed in [**2111**], cirrhosis diagnosed
in [**2129**], and CML on gleevac (since [**2127**]) who presents for
expidited pre-transplant workup from clinic. The patient states
that she first experienced clinical manifestations of her liver
disease in [**2129**] following her total colectomy. A biopsy
performed at that time revealed cirrhosis with extensive
canalicular cholestasis. Liver disease was well controlled until
after her colectomy in [**2129**], when her bilirubin began to rise.
In the last two months, she has become more symptomatic with
jaundice and volume overload. On [**2132-9-8**], the patient was
admitted to [**Hospital 794**] hospital with worsening ascites, anasarca,
and acute kidney injury. Following her discharge, she has
experienced episodes of severe fatigue and mild dyspnea on
exertion.
.
Today, she presented to liver clinic for transplantation
evaluation and complained of non-productive cough x 5 days, SOB,
ongoing fatigue. She has not had any history of prior GI bleed
and denies any hematochezia, melena, hematemesis, diarrhea,
nausea or vomiting. She was admitted directly from liver clinic
for hypotension to the 70s and need for expedited transplant
work up. Labs on arrival were notable for WBC of 21.6. A small
amount of ascites was seen on US, therefore she was sent for IR
guided paracentesis, which was unusucessful. Vanc/ceftriaxone
was started for coverage of SBP and PNA given recent respiratory
symptoms. She was also given albumin for SBP treatment. While on
the floor, maroon stool was noted in her colostomy bag and
hematocrit was found to be 17.9, therefore transfusion was
started and she was transferred to the ICU for urgent EGD.
Pressures on transfer were in the 90s, HR in the 80s.

Past Medical History:
-UC s/p total colectomy in [**2129**]
-PSC diagnosed in [**2111**]
-cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2129**] (c/b jaundice and ascites)
-CML on gleevac (since [**2127**])
-foot fracture s/p surgery
-deaf in R


Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91442**] is independent with her ADLs. She is a stay at home
mom that is fully functioning and active with her two teenage
children, a 13 year old son and a 15 year old daughter. She and

Imaging:
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL; DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL [**2132-10-15**]
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
2. Small scarred and distorted liver, which makes it difficult
to assess for small focal lesions. Consider alternative forms of
imaging such as CT or MRI to further characterize the hepatic
architecture.
3. Scant trace of ascites, however, the amount is insufficient
to safely tap.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Small gallbladder polyp.
.
CXR [**2132-10-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, likely of
noncardiogenic origin given the lack of cardiomegaly. No
evidence of pneumonia.
.
ECHO [**2132-10-16**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function. No
significant valvular abnormality seen. Mildly elevated pulmonary
artery pressures that likely reflect increased flow rather than
intrinsic lung disease.
.
MRCP [**2132-10-17**]:
1. Markedly cirrhotic / fibrotic liver with segmental atrophy of
the entire left lobe and segment VIII of the liver. No
suspicious focal liver lesion identifed. There is peripheral
segmental intra-hepatic biliary dilatation in keeping with
primary sclerosing cholangitis.
2. While the middle and left hepatic vein are diminutive owing
to the
extensive fibrosis centrally and within the left lobe of the
liver, all the visualised hepatic and portal veins are patent.
