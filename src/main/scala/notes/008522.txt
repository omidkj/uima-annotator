Hypotension

1) Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
78 year old man with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p
recent
RCA Taxil stent [**1-18**], AF and sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker
in [**3-20**] revised in [**4-20**], CHF with EF 45% recently admitted from
[**Date range (1) 9184**] for atypical chest pain (no interventions) comes in this
AM for elective cardiac cath to evaluate for restrictive
cardiomyopathy.  During the procedure his pressures dropped from
the 130s/80s to sbp of 70s, he also was somnolent (?due to
versed and fentanyl).  He was not responsive to atropine, or to
low doses of dopamine, but responded to 15mcg/kg/min of
dopamine.  EKG not consistent with ischemia, no other s/s.  The
patient was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.

Given his symmetric LVH, diseases such as sarcoid and amyloid
were possible but pt has not wanted a biopsy to date.  An ECHO
earlier this month showed severe symmetric LVH, inferior and
septal hypokinesis, an EF 45% as above, a small pericardial
effusion, and an abnormally small LV cavity (which is not
reported on a repeat ECHO this admission).  The last two
findings are new since [**10-19**].  An exercise stress test as well
as a persantine stress test earlier this month were both
prematurely terminated after the patient dropped his pressures.
He had a normal ETT in '[**31**] and an ETT with elevation in his BP
with exercise in [**10-19**].


Past Medical History:
1. Sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker [**3-20**], revised [**4-20**] as lead
was disconnected and patient p/w HR in 190s
2. Afib - on coumadin chronically (held 4d prior to cath),
amiodarone (dc'd 1.5 weeks ago [**12-18**] LFT abnl), AV paced
3. CHF - EF 45%, on coreg, altace, digoxin, lasix and asa as
outpatient
4. Prostate CA s/p TURP c/b bleeding [**4-20**]; last PSA 0.8 in [**6-20**]
5. Gout - on allopurinol
6. CAD s/p Taxil to ostial RCA [**1-18**]
7. GERD - on protonix
8. Anemia - baseline HCT 30-33 but data only from [**6-20**]; per wife
in high 30s >1 year ago.
9. Hematuria - after TURP, therefore not on plavix for stent
[**47**]. CRI - baseline Cr 1.2-1.6 but data only from [**6-20**]

Cardiac Cath ([**7-16**]):
COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed two
vessel
coronary disease.  The LMCA had mild, diffuse plaquing.  The LAD
was
moderately calcified but contained no flow-limiting disease.  A
D1
branch contained a modest sized, long lower pole 80% stenosis.
The LAD
wrapped around the apex. The LCX had mild luminal irregularities

throughout but was otherwise without flow-limiting disease.  The
RCA had
an ostial 40% stenosis that resulted in pressure dampening on
engagement
of the vessel.  This was somewhat attenuated with use of a JR5
catheter.
The proximal RCA stent was patent with a relative 50-60%
stepdown
afterwards.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated mean RA pressure of
16mmHg.
PCPW tracing was difficult to acquire and actual measurements
probably
represented a hybrid of PCPW and PA pressure.  LVEDP was
elevated at
20mmHg.  Cardiac output via the Fick method was 3.4 l/min with a
cardiac
index of 1.8 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4.  Central aortic pressure was low immediately after obtaining
arterial
access.  Pressure was approximately 80/60.  The patient had no
symptoms
of lightheadedness or back pain.  Administration of atropine and

flumazenil (to reverse the versed given before the case) did not
improve
the blood pressure.  The patient did not respond to infusions of

dopamine at 5 or 10 mcg/kg/min.  Ultimately, at 15 mcg/kg/min,
the blood
pressure rose to 120/80 with a pulse in the 70s.  Cardiac output
on
7.5mcg/kg/min dopamine was 3.7 l/min.
5.  A STAT echocardiogram done in the cath lab revealed
"bradycardic"
appearing heart with EF 40% and no evidence of effusion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Diastolic dysfunction.

ECHO ([**7-16**]):
Conclusions:
1. Limited focused study.
2. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
3.The right atrium is moderately dilated.
4.There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include basal
and mid septal hypokinesis.
5.The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
6.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No color
doppler study
was done to assess for the presence of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
8.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential.
9. An echogenic density in the right ventricle is present
consistent with a
pacemaker lead.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2142-7-5**], the
pericardial effusion is much less. The overall function is
unchanged.

CT Abd, non contrast ([**7-16**]) r/o retroperitoneal bleed
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or groin hemorrhage.
2. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusion effusions and
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Innumerable punctate low-attenuation liver lesions. These are
likely benign but are too small to characterize.
4. Irregular thickened bladder wall. This may be partially due
to incomplete distention of the bladder. There is likely a small
right bladder diverticulum. Further evaluation of the bladder
wall with direct visualization should be considered.
5. Left hydrocele.

EKG ([**7-16**]): c/w LBBB as patient is paced; no evidence of acute
STEMI, no change on [**7-17**].

CT chest ([**2142-6-20**]): small calcifications c/w granulomas in LLL
and RUL, as well as in liver.  Pulmonary nodule in LUL.  Small
mediatstinal nodes.  Small b/l pleural effusions. Small
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiovascular
A. Rate/Rhythm - The patient had underlying AF, SSS with pacer
in place. He came in on a beta blocker. These were held the day
of catheterization but were added back the following day.  While
here he was well controlled on this regimen.  Coum
