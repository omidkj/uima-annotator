[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   89 year old man with new dual chamber ppm.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   s/p ppm placement. check leads and ptx.

Final Report
HISTORY: Pacemaker placement, to evaluate for leads and
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study [**2-9**], there has been
placement of a
dual-lead pacemaker device, with the leads in the region of the
right atrium
and apex of the right ventricle. Specifically, no evidence of
pneumothorax.
The right IJ sheath has been removed. Left retrocardiac opacity
and small
effusion persists.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. PFO
is present. Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at
rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Partial
mitral leaflet flail. Mild mitral annular calcification. No MS.
Eccentric MR jet. Effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2. MR
vena contracta is >=0.7cm Severe (4+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the eccentric
MR jet, its severity may be underestimated (Coanda effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: No TS. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. A patent foramen ovale
is present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric, anterior directed
jet of severe MR is seen. The effective regurgitant orifice is
>=0.40cm2 The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced

1. A bioprosthesis is well seated in the mitral position. Trace
central MR is noted that is normal for this prosthesis. Mean
gradient across this valve is 7 mmof Hg.
2. LV function is unchanged. RV function initially moderate
depressed then improved to normal.
3. No flow is seen across the interatrial septum, evidence of
septal repair/closure seen.
4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
5. TR is still mild.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
