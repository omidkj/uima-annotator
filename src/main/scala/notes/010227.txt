.
Pt is s/p trimalleolar fx, being treated at rehab, cast removed
on Monday (3 days PTA), and started physical therapy.  Also on
Monday,  the pt developed dry cough, runny nose, congestion. No
CP/SOB. Took Robitussin without benefit.  Sx persisted--Tuesday
night, noted increasing congestion, cough, refused all meds for
sx relief from RN at rehab, around midnight, RN called to
bedside b/c pt developed difficulty  breathing, SOB, diaphoresis
(no chest pain per pt, and no CP documented in OSH records).
EMS called, vitals when seen: O2sat 86% on RA, NRB--96%, BP
190/P, HR 76.  En route given NTG X 2, lasix, JVP noted to be
elev, BP initially with 190s, (blood sugar noted to be 440s, no
h/o DM, given 10 units regular insulin IV), w/ increasing SOB,
tachypnea, NTP 1 inch ribbon applied, then BP noted to be
falling to 80s systolic even after NTP removed.  Pt started on
dopamine gtt, titrated up to 10mcg/kg/min, with improvement in
BP to 112, and was weaned off nitro gtt while being transported
from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**].  At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], vitals: Temp 97.8
BP: 144/69 P: 74 RR: 38 with o2sat not documented. Labs notable
for WBC 4.7, Hct 23, plt 18, lactate 2.2, UA neg with 100
glucose and 30 protein, Na 134, K 4.5, Co2 24.5, BUN 28, Cr 1.5,
tbili 1.42 with LFTS AST 10, ALT 24, CK 15, TnT 0.02, tele strip
from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] showing NSR at 60bpm. CXR showing acute pulm
edema, CHF.
.
In the ED here, VSS, satting 100% on 2L NC, BP noted to be
160s/90s with pulse 70s.  Pt went into atrial fibrillation to HR
130s, BP 110/60, lasted ~5min then pt spontaneously went into
NSR.  Ddimer was [**2088**].  CTA completed showing no PE, but + LLL
consolidation and mild volume overload.   Given 40mg IV lasix in
ED, output noted to be ~1.5L from 8am to 1pm.  Foley placed.
Received 1g CTX IV X 1 and Azithro 500mg po X 1.  Also received
mucomyst with IVF and 3 amps bicarb for renal protection prior
to CTA.

ABD CT [**2170-2-18**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Parastomal hernia in the left lower quadrant, which contains
a loop of transverse colon and free fluid, which may represent
early incarceration. Clinical correlation recommended.
2. Borderline dilated loops of small bowel in a nonobstructive
pattern which may represent focal ileus.
3. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural
effusion. The tiny pleural effusion appears somewhat loculated.
4. Tiny pericardial effusion.
5. Layering gallstone.
6. Calcified granulomata in the spleen, and small splenule.
7. Multiple low-density lesions in the kidneys, too small to
fully characterize.
8. Large hiatal hernia.
.
ABD US [**2170-2-18**]
Three radiographs of the abdomen demonstrate physiologically
air-distended loops of bowel. Retained contrast material is
evident within the bilateral kidneys and ureters, secondary to
the patient's recently acquired contrast-enhanced CT
examination. The left lower quadrant ostomy is possibly excluded
from the imaged field of view. Mild levoscoliosis and marked
degenerative change of the thoracolumbar spine is noted. No
pneumoperitoneum is evident.
IMPRESSION:
Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
