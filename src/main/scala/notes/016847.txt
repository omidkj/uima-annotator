History of Present Illness:
66 year old gentleman with known coronary artery disease who has
undergone stenting in the past who in Novemeber was admitted to

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   66 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluate left effusion



Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**2-22**]

HISTORY: Status post CABG. Evaluate left pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2101-2-20**]:

Small left pleural effusion is stable, and there is no
pneumothorax.
Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable
but there has
been a decrease in vascular plethora consistent with improving
cardiac
function.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of the inferior,
inferolateral and inferoseptal walls.. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). with
mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results on [**2101-2-14**] at 900am

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
and epinephrine. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. Appears well
seated. Mild mitral regurgitation persists. Mean gradient across
the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware. Aorta is intact
post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
