History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo quadriplegic male ([**3-13**] motorcycle accident 6
years ago) with h/o frequent UTIs who presented to the ED after
his VNA found him hypotensive this morning with BP 50/30. He
stated he was in his usual state of health (other than a recent
UTI for which he took 10 days of bactrim, ending 5 days prior to
this admission) until a few days ago. He reported feeling
general fatigue/malaise/nausea, with mild abdominal and back
pain (difficult to discuss ascertain given altered sensation).
He also reported mild dizziness when he got out of bed on the
morning of admission. As above, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is dependent on
intermittent urinary catheterization due to his paralysis and
has had frequent UTIs ([**6-14**] in the past year; the last being [**3-13**]
klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to bactrim, cipro,
nitrofurantoin).

In the ED his initial BP was 60's/40's with HR of 64, improving
with IVF to 70's/30's, and finally 80's after 4L IVF bolus. In
the ED a Precept catheter was placed, he was given empiric
ceftriaxone and vancomycin and was started on Levophed after his
CVP>8. SVO2 70

Past Medical History:
- quadriplegia and TBI [**3-13**] MVA several years ago
- h/o DVT's (1 year ago)
- autonomic dysfunction: frequent swings of blood pressure
associated with not having BMs
- urinary retnsion requiring straight cath: frequent UTI's (most
recent due to Klebsiella resistant to ciproflox and
nitrofurantoin)
- chronic cystitis (?cystoscopy at [**Hospital1 2025**] with bladder irritation)

Social History:
Former computer and real-estate executive. Retired wealthy at
age 42 and traveled the country riding his motorcycle and
unfortunately had his accident while on a trip to [**State **]. Has 4
children; now lives with his wife and 2 of his kids at home with

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2105-12-22**] 10:38 AM
IMPRESSION:
No acute intrathoracic process.
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2105-12-23**] 9:47 AM
IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.
.
ECHO [**2105-12-24**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal basal to mid hypokinesis and apical sparing, which could
be most consistent with stress induced cardiomyopathy
(reverse-Takostubo type), although multivessel CAD cannot be
ruled out.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2105-12-26**] 9:04 AM
IMPRESSION: Dilated colonic bowel loops. Assessment for free air
limited. The findings likely represent a colonic ileus, however,
early distal colonic obstruction is not definitively excluded.
Followup is recommended. Findings were discussed with the
covering resident at the time of dictation on [**2105-12-26**] at 12:15
p.m.
.
[**2105-12-28**] 9:02 PM
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral basilar consolidation, effusion, and atelectasis,
concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
2. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
3. No perinephric abscess or evidence of other acute
intra-abdominal pathology.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2105-12-28**] 5:14 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-24**] through 18:
Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened since [**12-27**]
accompanied by increasing moderate right pleural effusion. There
is also markedly asymmetric pulmonary consolidation strongly
suggestive of pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage worsened
particularly in the right upper lobe. Heart size top normal. ET
tube and nasogastric tube in standard placements. Right jugular
line ends in the lower SVC. Findings were discussed by telephone
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to report these findings at the time of
dictation.
.
ECHO [**2105-12-28**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-12-24**],
LVEF is now normal.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2105-12-31**] 2:16 PM
The liver is unremarkable in appearance without focal or
textural abnormalities. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is
seen. The common bile duct is prominent measuring 9 mm in
greatest diameter in its proximal portion. It is tapering
smoothly distally, and its appearance is stable compared to CT
of [**2105-12-28**]. No common bile duct stones are seen. The
gallbladder is normal. There is no cholelithiasis or evidence of
cholecystitis. There is no gallbladder sludge. The main portal
vein is patent. The pancreas appears unremarkable. There is no
ascites.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, or sludge.
