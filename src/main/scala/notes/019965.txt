Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-7-28**] - Aortic valve replacement(25mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine
valve)/Ascending aorta replacement (32mm Gelweave
graft)/Coronary artery bypass graftingx1 (Left internal mammary
artery->Left anterior descending artery).


History of Present Illness:
83-year-old gentleman who has had increasing shortness of breath
with occasional episodes of palpitations this past spring. He
was hospitalized for heart failure in late [**Month (only) 547**] and treated
with diuretics. He admits to worsening shortness of breath and
some lower extremity edema.  Ultimately this prompted
echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization, which showed
single-vessel coronary artery disease, aortic insufficiency and
a dilated aorta. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 205**] for surgical
management and presents today for preoperative testing. He is
scheduled for surgery on [**2105-7-28**] which will be an
ascending aorta replacement, aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass grafting versus a bental procedure with
bypass grafting.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2105-7-28**]
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is elongated. The left atrium is
dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately to
severely dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe apical hypokinesis and mild
global hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
markedly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
markedly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Severe (4+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The base of the posterior mitral leaflet
is particularly thickened and calcified. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being atrially paced. The patient is
receiving epinephrine by infusion. There is normal right
ventricular systolic function. The left ventricle displays
moderate to severe apical hypokinesis with mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Ejection fraction is in the 35-40%
range. There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic position. It
appears well seated. Initially, after separation from bypass,
several jets of aortic regurgitation were seen. One appeared to
be a trace to mild jet of paravalvular AI that transversed the
left ventricular outflow tract. The other jets appeared to be
trace and valvular in origin. 30 minutes later, only a single
jet of trace AI was seen, it's origin not identifiable. The
leaflets of the bioprosthesis are not seen. The effective valve
area of the valve was about 2 cm2 with a peak gradient of 13
mmHg and a mean of 7 mmHg. The ascending aortic graft is seen
only poorly in situ. The rest of the thoracic aorta apperas
unchanged. Mild mitral regurgitation persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
for Ascending aorta replacement, aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative report for
further details.  He received vancomycin for perioperative
antibiotics.  Postoperatively he was transferred to the
intensive care unit for hemodynamic management.  In the first
twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
He was progressively weaned off pressors on post operative day
one.  He developed atrial fibrillation which he was treated with
beta blockers and amiodarone.  On postoperative day two he
converted to normal sinus rhythm, and was transferred to the
postoperative floor.  His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires
were removed per protocol. Physical therapy worked with him on
strength and mobility.  He was cleared for discharge to home
with his family and 24 hr care which was already in place and
VNA services.
Of note Mr. [**Known lastname 82656**] was discharged on 10meq of potassium
supplement while he is not takin his lisinopril. once his
lisinopril starts, he may need the potassium stopped.
