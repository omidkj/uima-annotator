Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral lower extremity pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC Filter Placement

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 36 year old woman with widely metastatic
cholangiocarcinoma, C. difficile associated diarrhea, esophageal
varices with h/o variceal hemorrhage, and portal hypertension
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2-8**] for ascending cholangitis
and GNR bacteremia. Since discharge she has developed
progressively worsening lower extremity pain and shortness of
breath, especially with exertion. She was seen in clinic today
and sent to the emergency department for evaluation.
.
In the emergency department, her initial VSs were 96.9, 131,
97/70, 16, 100% 2LNC. LENIs demonstrated bilateral DVTs. Because
of her h/o variceal bleeding and guaiac positive stool, plan was
made for IVC filter placement. Due to her contrast allergy,
however, she was started on pre-treatment with methylpredisolone
and diphenhydramine. After discussing with the oncology service,
plan was made for admission to ICU overnight for closer
monitoring, no anticoagulation and CTA and IVC filter
implantation in the morning.
.
Also in clinic, note was made of increasing abdominal
distension. Her last paracentesis was [**2-7**]. She is also having
worsening diarrhea, and metronidazole was started on top of
vancomycin PO for C. difficile associated diarrhea.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2177-2-14**] 11:27 AM
FINDINGS: Targeted ultrasound of the four quadrants of the
abdomen demonstrates a large amount of ascites. An appropriate
spot was marked in the right lower quadrant for paracentesis to
be performed by the clinical team.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2177-2-19**] 1:00 PM
FINDINGS: There is a large amount of ascites present. An
appropriate spot was marked in the right lower quadrant for
peritoneal tap.
Review of the CT scan of [**2177-2-6**] shows evidence of a
biliary stent in place, pneumobilia, and mild-to-moderate
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Ultrasound examination done
today confirms the presence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation,
the degree of dilatation is mild. Many of the biliary radicles
have echogenic foci consistent with air. Note is also made of a
stent running from the common duct down, presumably towards the
duodenum. The diameter of the common duct was just under 8 mm,
it is noted that the patient is status post cholecystectomy.
CONCLUSION: Appropriate spot marked in the right lower quadrant
for peritoneal tap. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation. There
is a biliary stent in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P (updated): 36F PMH metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal
varices with h/o variceal bleed, recent admit for ascending
cholangitis and GNR bacteremia presents with BLE DVT and PE,
worsening diarrhea, and worsening abdominal distension.
.
# Hypotension: likely related to hypovolemia as below. She was
not found to be septic despite repeated evaluations.  She was
likely third-spacing much of the volume given during fluid
resuscitation: ascites, anasarca, complicated by poor nutrition
and protein loss in ascites and ascitic fluid removal which was
performed to relieve abdominal discomfort.  An attempt was made
to replete intravascular volume with blood products, but this
did not appreciably improve her blood pressure, despite a
hematocrit above 30. During this course, she was treated with
xeloda in an attempt to gain control over her malignancy,
improve comfort and to reduce ascites. However, her disease
continued to progress. Given the progression of her disease
despite attempts at treatment, her continued discomfort, and the
inability to improve her clinical state despite multiple medical
interventions, she was made CMO.  Her blood pressure dropped in
the final hours of her life.
.
# Renal failure: She developed renal failure likely from
hypoperfusion from low intravascular volume (see above).
.
# Abdominal distension: Repeated re-accumulation of ascitic
fluid due to portal hypertension and peritoneal studding. RUQ US
shows complete occlusion of right portal vein and partial
occlusion of main portal vein. She received a peritoneal drain
port for symptomatic care. Leukonostoc species and [**Female First Name (un) **] was
