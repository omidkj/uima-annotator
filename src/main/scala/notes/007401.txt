Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2474**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
63 yo M with hx of COPD and schizophrenia presents with
increasing SOB that began a couple of hours ago. He reports that
he took his home oxygen saturation and it was 74-79% on room air
(it is usually in the 88-92% range). He just began using home
oxygen last week and has recently been on a course of prednisone
for worsening COPD. He has productive white cough but this is
his baseline and he does not describe increasing amount of
sputum production or changes in sputum color. He denies any
fever, chills, chest pain, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, or
changes in bowel/urinary habits.
.
Talking with his home health aide, she reports that his oxygen
sats have been trending downward for the past 2-3 weeks. He
usually runs in the 88-92% range on room air, but over the last
couple of weeks has been running in the mid 80s and then down to
the 70s, which was the reason for starting home oxygen. She
reports that he is generally poorly compliant with medications
and has not been using his oxygen on a regular basis at home,
and he as also self-discontinued several prednisone tapers over
the past few months.
.
Today when the home health aide saw him, his oxygen was 70% on
room air. He received his albuterol and ipratropium nebs and his
oxygen came up to 74-75% range. However, when he walked a few
steps to his bed, his sats dropped to about 65% and his heart
rate went up to 105; he began complaining to the aide of
profound fatigue. Supplemental oxygen only brought his
saturation up to 82-84% range and the aide called EMS. Per her
report, the patient is very reluctant to be hospitalized [**3-10**] his
mental health issues and she had to negotiate with him to get
him to come in to the ED.
.
In the ED EKG was concerning for new T-wave inversions in leads
V2-V4 and cardiac enzymes were sent (1st set negative). CXR
showed R lower lobe infiltrate. He received prednisone 80mg,
Azithromycin 250mg, Iprotropium and Albuterol Nebs, ASA 325mg,
and Ceftriaxone for presumed COPD exacerbation and possible PNA.

Pertinent Results:
ADMISSION LABS:

.
TRENDS DURING HOSPITAL STAY:
WBC: 9.1 -> 14.3 -> 12.5
HCO3: Stable around 38-40 (chronic resp. acidosis, metabolic
alkalosis)
Cr: Stable around 0.8-1.0
CK: 38 -> 46
TropT: <0.01 -> <0.01
.
IMAGING:
CXR [**2159-9-17**]: New irregular airspace consolidation at the right
lung base
likely represents early pneumonia. Follow-up to resolution is
recommended,
given the patient's history of colon cancer.
.
EKG [**2159-9-17**]:
Sinus rhythm
Indeterminate axis - is nonspecific
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition -
is nonspecific but cannot exclude anterior myocardial
infarction, age indeterminate
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - suggest ischemia/injury
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2159-7-30**], delayed R wave progression
more prominent
and ST-T wave abnormalities now present
.
EKG [**2159-9-17**]:
TRACING SUBMITTED LATE AND OUT OF SEQUENCE. Sinus rhythm. Short
P-R interval.
Inferior and anterior mild ST segment elevation with more
prominent T wave
inversion change from leads V5-V6 and R wave may be related to
lead positions.
Since the subsequent tracing of [**2159-9-17**] probably no significant
change.
.
EKG [**2159-9-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Short P-R interval. Deep precordial S waves with
mild
ST segment elevation and T wave inversion. Since the previous
tracing
the rate is faster. Otherwise, no significant change in
previously noted
findings.
.
EKG [**2159-9-20**]:
Sinus bradycardia. Marked anterior precordial T wave inversion.
Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2159-9-18**] heart rate is reduced.
Otherwise, no major
change.
.
ECHO [**2159-9-18**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderately dilated right
ventricle with moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Severe
pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia and Dyspnea: Pt was initially admitted to floor on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed PNA as well as
steroids for COPD exacerbation. He became more tachypneic (to
the 50s-60s) during the night of his first hospital day with
poor air movement and worsening C02 retention as well as serial
ABGs showing persistent acidemia, hypoxia, and hypercarbia, and
was transfered to ICU for BIPAP.  Patient poorly tolerated Bipap
on and off throughout his first day in the ICU.  Overnight while
on BiPAP, patient became acutely agitated/confused with
worsening C02/acidosis on ABG, increased tachypnea and worsening
air movement.  He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  Pt's f/u CXR showed blossoming of RLL PNA. Pt was
treated for CAP with 5 day course of levaquin.  He was able to
be successfully extubated on hospital day 4, transiently on
Bipap and then stable on 3L NC.  He was treated initially with
60mg of steroids and then tapered slowly for a planned 14 day
taper. He was continued on albuterol, his advair dose was
increased and he had a successful trial of tiotropium. He was
able to be transferred back to the floor where he was continued
on his antibiotics, steroids, and standing/PRN inhalers and was
hemodynamically stable as well as stable from a respiratory
standpoint.  He still demonstrated persistent desaturation to
the 70% range during ambulation, however even at this time
patient said he was "fine" and denied any SOB, lightheadedness,
or other symptoms of hypoxia.  He was kept inpatient until his
ambulatory O2 saturation remained in the 90% range and then
discharged home.
.
# EKG changes: Patient had TWI on admission EKG.  He was ruled
out for MI with 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Several
serial EKGs showed persistent TWI but no new changes.  Patient
was started on ASA and discharged on this.  Echo showed R
ventricle hypokinesis and moderate RV dilation but this was
believed to be [**3-10**] patient's known severe pulmonary HTN as a
