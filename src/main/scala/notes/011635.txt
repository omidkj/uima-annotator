Service:  CCU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old female
with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an outside hospital for cardiac
catheterization after non-ST elevation MI.  The patient
originally presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on [**2175-6-7**]
following 2 days of fatigue, malaise, and dry cough.  The
patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea,
PND, edema, and weight gain, though the daughter reported a 1-
day history of dyspnea.  On presentation, a chest x-ray
performed showed CHF, and an EKG revealed inferior T-wave
inversions and a right bundle-branch block.  Troponin I was
17, CK 476, CK-MB 29 with an index of 0.57.  The patient's
oxygen saturations were 76 percent on room air, which
improved with diuresis.  The patient was started on heparin
drip, nitro drip, aspirin, Plavix, and beta-blocker.  Her
troponin peaked to 22.  The patient also went into
asymptomatic atrial fibrillation.  An echo performed revealed
an ejection fraction of 40 percent with inferior posterior
akinesis, lateral hypokinesis, and 2 to 3 plus MR.  The
patient's BNP was also noted to be elevated, and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.  On arrival
to our Emergency Department, the patient had no complaints.
She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
orthopnea, PND, or edema.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND SULFA.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Accupril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Evista 60 mg q.d.
5. Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
6. Norvasc 7.5 mg alternating with 5 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide 375/25 mg p.o. q.d.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia.

Hypertension.

History of CVA, [**2169**], without residual deficits.

History of nephrolithiasis.

Parathyroid nodules, status post resection.

Osteoarthritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 1411**].  She has
a daughter and 2 sons who live nearby.  The patient quit
smoking tobacco 30 years ago.  The patient denies alcohol
abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a son and daughter with CHF.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile, BP 91/44,
heart rate 113, respiratory rate 33, and saturation 96
percent on 5 L.  General:  Well-appearing elderly woman in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Moist
mucous membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  JVP at 8 cm.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
Irregularly irregular.  Normal S1 and S2.  No evidence of
rubs or gallops.  There is a [**2-10**] holosystolic murmur at the
apex.  Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  There is a positive hepatojugular reflux.
Extremities:  No evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
DP and PT pulses are 2 plus bilaterally.

DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  EKG, atrial fibrillation at 125 beats per
minute.  There is left axis deviation and a left anterior
fascicular block.  There are ST depressions in V1 through V3
and ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Coronary artery disease.  The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] directly to the cardiac catheterization
suite where she had a cardiac catheterization that revealed 3-
vessel coronary artery disease (diffuse LAD disease with a
mid 60 percent stenosis, a totally occluded D1, 70 percent
left circumflex lesion, 90 percent RCA lesion, and 99 percent
occlusion of the PDA.)  The patient underwent a PTCA of the
proximal RCA lesion, but was unsuccessful crossing the distal
stenosis.  The patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix, beta-
blocker, and ACE inhibitor throughout the remainder of her
hospitalization.  Her doses of beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor
were titrated, as her heart rate and blood pressure allowed.

Hypotension.  The patient was briefly hypotensive during her
cardiac catheterization and briefly required a dopamine drip.
This was considered possibly secondary to a dye load versus a
fentanyl, nitroglycerin, and beta-blocker she received during
her catheterization.  Her dopamine was titrated to off after
arrival to the CCU, and the patient remained hemodynamically
stable throughout her brief hospitalization.  The patient had
a hemodynamics measured during her catheterization, which
were significant for an RA pressure of 8, RV pressure of
29/5, PA pressure of 25/15, and a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 15.  Her cardiac output was calculated at 2.85
with a cardiac index of 1.69.

CHF.  As noted previously, the patient had an echocardiogram
at the outside hospital that was significant for an ejection
fraction of 40 percent with inferior posterior akinesis and
lateral hypokinesis.  The patient appeared well compensated
on physical exam on transfer.  As noted previously, she was
continued on the beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor with doses
titrated up as tolerated by her blood pressure and heart
rate.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable and
asymptomatic throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient was noted to go in to
atrial fibrillation at her outside hospital.  She was
continued on a beta-blocker for rate control.  She was also
maintained on the heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic
on Coumadin.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right
coronary artery.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

Congestive heart failure.

Atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Metoprolol succinate sustained release 200 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.


FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has a follow-up appointment with her
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**Last Name (STitle) 766**], [**2175-6-19**], at
11 o'clock a.m.  Her primary care physician will check her
INR level and adjust her Coumadin dose as necessary.  The
patient's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3497**] will contact the patient on
[**Name (NI) 766**], [**2175-6-19**], to arrange a follow-up appointment.
