Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Right foot bleeding.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right fifth open ray amputation
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with clipping of duodenal ulcer
PICC line placement
AV fistula placement


History of Present Illness:
60F with h/o CKD on HD T/T/S, CAD s/p CABG ([**2172**]), STEMI ([**2174**]),
sCHF (EF 35%) s/p AICD placement, IDDM, PVD presents with 1 day
h/o bleeding from chronic right foot ulcer. Pt was sent in from
vascular clinic for evaluation after dressing was changed x3 for
bleeding in clinic and NP from [**Hospital3 2558**] asked to have
ulcer evaluated in ED before returning home. She does endorse
increased pain in the right foot and perhaps some green
discharge from R foot in last week, but isn't sure. Denies
malodor, fever, chills.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.3 80 100/36 16 96% RA.
Podiatry and vascular surgery were consulted in the ED. Podiatry
described the wound on the 5th metatarsal as clean and stable
with sanguinous drainage, likely representing stable, chronic
osteomyelitis of the 5th metatarsal. They debrided the ulcer and
felt it was stable and not newly infected and sent samples for
gram stain and aerobic/anaerobic culture. Debridement led to
significant bleeding which was controlled with pressure and
silver cautery by vascular surgery. Plain film performed which
showed likely osteo in R 5th MTP and phalanx. Because of left
shift and renal failure, they recommended admission and to hold
antibiotics until culture results. VS at transfer: 98 80 107/58
18 94%RA.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2181-4-24**] with
hyperkalemia and evidence of AoCRF. She had a temp line placed
for HD after her diuretic adjustment was unsuccesssful. Plan was
to follow up for fistula as outpatient. She was discharged off
all diuretics. Weight at discharge (felt to be dry) 90.6kg.
.
Currently, she is hungry and complains of chronic L stump pain
and pain in R foot.
