History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] is a 56 year old male with a history of CAD s/p DES
x2 (LCx and mLAD), DM, OSA, CHF and HTN who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED after 1 day of fatigue, bilateral leg pain and left arm pain.
The patient was in his usual state of health until the day prior
to admission, when he woke up with L arm pain in addition to
weakness and achiness in his legs bilaterally. His left arm pain
resolves with 2 tablets of nitroglycerin. He also reports
feeling "rotten" with general fatigue. These symptoms persisted
all day, and prompted the patient to see his cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on the day of admission. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that the patient's
appearance and symptoms were significantly off of baseline and
found the patient to be hypotensive and sent him to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
Of note, the patient has had several other symptoms off of his
baseline recently. He reports feeling light-headed
intermittently over the past 2 months with changes in position,
and needs to take a pause to steady himself after standing from
supine or sitting recently. In addition, he reports in the past
3-4 weeks developing mild chest pain with exertion such as
lifting objects and climbing stairs which resolves with rest. He
also develops leg achiness after prolonged walks. Of note,
patient also had a brief 20 minute of L-sided weakness on
awakening about 3-4 weeks ago for which he was going to get a
head MRI later this week. He denies dyspnea, PND, orthopnea,
palpitations, new leg swelling. No fever, chills, night sweats,
n/v/d, cough or URI symptoms, abdominal pain, changes in
bowel/bladder habits. Patient also denies any history of thyroid
disease, headaches, rashes or other skin changes, any new or
changed medications or any deviation from his normal medication
regimen/adherence in the past weeks/months.
In the ED, the patient's vitals were 96% 2L 115/75 afebrile, 54,
13. Because of concern for stroke, the patient had a CT Head
which was negative for acute intracrnial process. Shortly after
arrival to the ED, the patient became hypotensive to the 70-80's
with some latered mental status. A RIJ central line was placed
and shortly afterwards, the patient's HR went down to 35, and
responded to atropine going up to 63. He received levophed and
his BPs improved to 148/80.. The patient also receieved 4.5g IV
Zosyn while in the ED and a CT Thoarx which showed no acute
processes.
On the floor, the patient's vitals were T Afebrile, HR 54, BP
126/76, RR 12, O2 Sat 95% 4L. He was stable and comfortable,
though had some clotted blood in his mouth which appeared to be
epistaxis.
