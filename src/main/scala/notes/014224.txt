Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
left sided shaking, left gaze preference

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

central venous line placement
lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
85yo woman with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, h/o stroke in [**10-15**] with residual left sided weakness
and dysarthria, hyperlipidemia presented with left sided
shaking. She was was last seen well at 8pm the evening of
admission and was then found on the floor of the bathroom around
midnight. Her daughter heard her call out that she couldn't get
up; she was lodged between the toilet and the wall. She was
unable to stand without assistance; she did not answer queries
to where she was. She was "looking off to her left" according to
her daughter and was not saying much. She then started shaking
on her left side (beginning with curling of her left side). The
daughter's vantage point was behind the patient and she is
unsure of which side was shaking or if both were.

Per history, EMS found her awake but with R-sided weakness and
"+GTC seizure activity (eyes deviated towards the right) lasting
<1minute at a time". She received two rounds of ativan 3mg and
another two doses of valium 5mg and was intubated at the scene
by EMS for airway protection.

She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] and a code stroke was called.

Review of systems per her daughter: +malaise, for which she
presented to her PCP one week prior. No neck pain, headache,
cough, fever, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

Past Medical History:
Stroke, as above; required her to walk with a walker
Recent urinary tract infection, treated with ciprofloxacin from
[**Date range (1) 23742**]
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Quit smoking 10yrs ago. No etoh since [**Month (only) 404**] per her daughter;
previous etoh abuse. No other drug use. Lives with her daughter.
In [**Name2 (NI) 404**], was falling and drinking heavily.

.
.
Studies:
.
CXR ([**4-12**]): Mild hydrostatic edema presumably cardiogenic in
etiology.
Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, although an
underlying
infection cannot be entirely excluded.
.
Head CT ([**4-12**]): No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke.  Chronic
ischemic
changes and age-appropriate atrophy as above
.
CTA/CTP ([**4-12**]):
1. Small, 3 mm focal dilatation at the origin of the posterior
communicating artery and the internal carotid artery on the left
could represent an aneurysm.
2. 50% stenoses of the left common carotid artery at the level
of the bulb and the origin of the left internal carotid artery,
respectively.
3. 60% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery in the
neck.
4. Diffuse. vascular atherosclerotic, calcific disease.
.
MRI/A ([**4-12**]):
1. No evidence of acute infarction by diffusion-weighted
imaging.
2. Subacute versus chronic, likely chronic right posterior
cerebral artery territory infarct in the occipital lobe.
3. Evidence of small vessel ischemia.
4. Three-mm aneurysm extending posteriorly of the left
supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery.
.
Head CT ([**4-16**]): Stable appearance of the brain.
.
CT c-spine ([**4-12**]): Severe degenerative changes throughout the
cervical spine somewhat limiting assessment. Possible fractures
identified at the left anterior arch of C1, as well as within
the dens.  MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**4-14**]): 1.  The changes seen on CT at C1-2 level
appear to be due to advanced degenerative change with thickening
of the transverse ligament and degenerative pannus formation.
No evidence of fracture of the odontoid process or lateral
masses of C1 or C2 identified. 2.  Changes of cervical
spondylosis predominantly from C3-4 to C6-7. 3.  No evidence of
intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic
spinal cord compression. 4.  No evidence of ligamentous
disruption.
.
Abd u/s ([**4-23**]): 1.  Distended gallbladder with asymmetric edema
within the gallbladder wall, indeterminate for the presence or
absence of acute cholecystitis.  Recommend further
characterization with a HIDA scan. 2.  Prominent CBD, measuring
0.96 cm in size.  The distal CBD and head of the pancreas are
not well seen- recommend further visualization with contrast
enhanced CT of the Abdomen. 3. Pedunculated cystic lesion
projecting between the lateral left lobe of the liver and the
pancreas. The origin of this cystic lesion is incompletely
resolved with the current study and further characterization
with a CT scan is recommended.
.
RUQ US [**4-25**]:
1. Limited evaluation of the liver, without focal mass lesions.
Normal hepatic vasculature.
2. Minimal gallbladder wall edema and sludge are identified. The
edema would be consistent with third spacing of fluid related to
the patient's underlying hepatic disease.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets and
supporting structures.
.
EEG ([**4-12**]): Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very low
voltage
slow background and with bursts of generalized slowing. There
were some
periods with a markedly suppressed background. These findings
indicate
a widespread encephalopathy.
.
EEG ([**4-16**]): : This 24-hour EEG telemetry captured no
electrographic
seizures. No interictal epileptiform discharges were seen. The
background was slow and disorganized throughout much of the
recording
indicating a mild to moderate encephalopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the neurology ICU after being
intubated for airway protection after receiving several rounds
of ativan for seizure activity. Hospital course was complicated
and is reviewed below
