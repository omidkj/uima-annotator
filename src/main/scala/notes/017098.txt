Pertinent Results:
[**2140-4-12**] Intraop TEE: Prebypass: 1.No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. 2. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] 3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. 4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse of
anterior as well as posterior leaflets. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail ( A2 portion of the anterior leaflet). Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Post bypass: 1. Post bypass
patient is being AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. 2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
3. Mechanical valve seen in the mitral position. Leaflets move
well and the valve appears well seated. Washing jets typical for
this prosthesis is seen. Mean gradient is 3. 5 mm Hg. 4. Aorta
intact post decannulation.
[**4-25**] CXR: Three radiographs of the chest again demonstrate an
enlarged cardiac silhouette, unchanged from [**2140-4-22**]. Bibasilar
atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low.
Trachea is midline. A dual-lead left thoracic cardiac pacer is
unchanged. IMPRESSION: No interval change. Persistent bibasilar
atelectasis and cardiomegaly.
[**4-28**] Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthesis cannot be adequately assessed. There is a large
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential with
the largest amount posterior and apically to the LV. No right
atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular filling.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-4-28**] 9:55 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
38 year old man s/p MVR/MAZE
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
INDICATION: 30-year-old man status post MVR.

COMPARISON: [**2140-4-25**].

PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No significant change seen compared
to prior study. Left-sided pacer, leads, prosthetic mitral valve
and median sternotomy wires are in unchanged position. Again
seen are low lung volumes. Large cardiac silhouette is unchanged
from prior study. Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and likely
left pleural effusion noted.

IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery preoperatively for IV heparin
after stopping his Coumadin. He was taken to the operating room
on [**4-12**] where he underwent a mitral valve replacement and MAZE
procedure. See operative report for further details. He did
receive vancomycin perioperatively because he was in the
hospital preoperatively.  He was transferred to the ICU in
stable condition. He received 48 hours of Vancomycin due to
preoperative admission. In the first twenty four hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  He was found to be in atrial
flutter which converted to 2:1 AV block with ventricular rate
30-40 and stable blood pressure POD 1.  EP was consulted for
rhythm evaluation and he was paced via epicardial wires, atrial
sense with ventricular pacing with plan to monitor rhythm.  He
was transferred to the floor and physical therapy worked with
him on strength and mobility.  On POD 2 night he developed
complete heart block under his pacing and was transferred back
to the intensive care unit.  Due to inappropriate pacing with
epicardial wires, a transvenous pacemaker was inserted.  He
remained in the ICU with transvenous pacing and heparin for his
mechanical valve to monitor his rhythm.. He still remained in
2:1 AV block and [**4-18**] had a permanent pacemaker inserted.  He
was then transferred back to the floor.  He went on to develop
symptomatic hypotension associated with decreased hematocrit.
Echocardiogram was notable for large pericarial effusion with
early signs of tamponade. He therefore returned to the operating
room for pericardial window. Following his pericardial window,
he returned to the CVICU with chest tube in place. Heparin was
eventually resumed for a subtherapeutic prothrombin time. He
returned to the floor the following day. Chest tube was removed
without complication. Warfarin was dosed daily for a goal INR
between 3.0 - 3.5. Heparin was discontinue once INR reached 2.5.
The remaineder of his postoperative course was uneventful and he
was medically cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day
21/15/4. Arrangements made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who has agreed to
manage his Warfarin as an outpatient, spoke with [**Doctor Last Name **] in coumadin
clinic [**5-3**].
