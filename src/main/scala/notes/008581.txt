Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
1. Small bowel obstruction
2. Duodenal mass, metastatic breast cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2150-8-28**]: Biopsy of metastatic nodules and gastrojejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 64-years-old woman with a history of breast cancer
(metastatic to bone) who presented to an outside hospital on
[**7-31**] with nausea, vomiting and 24 lb weight loss over
the preceding 2 weeks (constant since prior admission for same).
 She was found to have hypokalemia and acute on chronic renal
failure.  She then developed a 7 second episode of Torsades
shortly after admission on [**2150-8-1**] with spontaneous conversion,
thought to be due to electrolyte abnormalities (Cr 3.1, K 2.5).
QT was prolonged. Cardiology was consulted and she was
transferred to the ICU.  Lytes aggressively repleted.
She then had a grand mal seizure [**8-2**], treated with ativan.
Neurology consulted.  MR head done (see report in chart and
briefly in results below, no major findings).  Neuro notes
report that they think the seizure was due to acute metabolic
encephalopathy due to acute illness.
She was stabilized and called out to the medical floor, but her
persistent vomiting, inability to tolerate PO and abdominal
discomfort continued.  Transfused 1 unit PRBCs [**8-8**] with Hct
bump from 26.9 to 30.1. A noncontrast abd CT scan was done. It
was a poor study and showed contrast remaining in stomach and
duodenum c/w SBO.  NGT placed; TPN started.  SBFT showed the
same.  EGD could not be passed beyond D3 due to a possible
extrinsic mass, even with pedi scope.  At that point,
reportedly, review of her CT suggested possible uncinate mass
(per our GI team discussion with OSH GI team - I do not see this
documented in OSH records however).
She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by our advanced
endoscopy team and consideration for EUS with biopsy if
appropriate.

On arrival: She is tired, has dull aching epigastric abdominal
pain, non radiating. She has nausea. She has discomfort from her
NG tube.
All other review of systems asked in detail is negative.

MRI Abdomen [**2150-8-16**]:
Inadequately characterized 2 x 4 cm ill-defined mass involving
the junction of second and third part of duodenum with mass
effect on the pancreatic head and compression of the duodenal
lumen resulting in mild upstream gastric distention. This lesion
may represent an intrinsic duodenal intramural mass, or
extramural lesion. While this lesion may possibly arise from the
pancreatic head, this is considered less likely given the
morphology of the lesion and apparent mass effect on the
pancreatic head.

CT HEAD [**2150-8-28**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo woman with history of breast cancer - metastatic to bone,
who presented to [**Hospital6 **] [**7-31**] with ARF and
hypokalemia, course complicated by brief self limited episode of
Torsades as well as seizure, now stabilized but with likely new
pancreatic mass leading to duodenal obstruction and inability to
take PO. Oncw stable, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
treatment of duodenal obstruction.

Patient was admitted on [**2150-8-14**] for treatment of duodenal
obstruction. NG tube was placed with relief of abdominal pain
and nausea. Port was accessed and TPN was started.
Communications with patient's oncologist revealed poor prognosis
from breast cancer. Prognosis was discussed with family who
agreed that goal would be for return of po intake. Patient was
given nutritional support with IVF and TPN and optimized
medically through pulmonary toilet (nebs, oxygen, chest PT) and
balanced with lasix diuresis for CHF and IV hydration for acute
renal failure, in preparation for surgical intervention.

Patient underwent biopsy of metastatic nodules and
gastrojejunostomy on [**2150-8-28**] without complications. In PACU,
patient found to be unresponsive and was reintubated for altered
mental status. CT head was negative for intracranial pathology
and patient slowly regained neurological function spontaneously.
She was admitted overnight for observationa and successfully
extubated on [**2150-8-29**] (POD1) without difficulty. She had no
residual neurological deficits and episode was attributed to
anesthetic reaction. Patient was kept in the ICU until POD#3 for
management of tachycardia. Patient was then transferred to the
floor in good condition, remainder of her course is described
below by system.

GI: Patient was kept NPO with NG tube in place until POD#3.
Patient had episodes of emesis on POD#4 and POD#5 and was
started on reglan with good effect. LFTs increased mildly postop
and TPN was held until they trended down, then restarted on
POD#5. Patient tolerated clear liquid diet on POD#6 and was
advanced to regular diet by POD#9. Po intake improved daily and
patient was passing flatus and having bowel movements. Pathology
revealed metastatic breast cancer in duodenum. Results were
discussed with the patient and her family with plans to f/u with
current oncologist for treatment. She was discharged to rehab on
a regular diet with ensure shakes for supplemental nutrition.

ID: Patient developed a wound infection of superior [**11-23**] of
abdominal incision on POD#8. Wound was opened and packed with
gauze. Patient was afebrile throughout this period with normal
WBC count. Wound vac will be applied in rehab and TID dressing
changes will continue until then.

CV: Patient's CHF was managed throughout preop and postop period
with lasix diuresis and IV metoprolol. Lasix was held several
times due to increase in Cr (Max 2.4) but was resumed when ARF
resolved. Cardiology was consulted preop for perioperative
recommendations. Echo was done on [**8-25**] and demonstarted mild
left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF= 45 %) consistent
with coronary artery disease. Post surgery, patient was
continued to be monitored via telemetryn with no events.

Renal: Patient's CRF was complicated with several instances of
increased Cr with max 2.4. Renal failure was pre-renal according
to FNA and was treated with IV hydration balanced with lasix
diuresis. Cr on discharge was stable at 1.9-2.

Neuro: No events during postop period outside of episode
described above. She was alert and oriented throughout hospital
stay.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Endocrine: Patient's diabetes was managed with RISS throughout
stay. Once tolerating clears, she was restarted on home diabetic
meds.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to ge
