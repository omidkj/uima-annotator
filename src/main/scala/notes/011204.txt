Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1232**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: elective admission for right adrenal mass removal.
REASON FOR [**Hospital Unit Name 20719**]: close respiratory monitoring,
wheezing.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right adrenalectomy ([**1-5**]).
Right-sided chest tube placement ([**1-5**]).
Right internal jugular central venous catheter placement
([**1-5**]).
Right arterial line placement ([**1-5**]).

History of Present Illness:
A 59-year-old woman who was admitted initially to the urology
service for elective right adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma.
Per report, patient underwent uncomplicated procedure in which
the right adrenal gland was approached through the diaphram on
the right side. Post-operatively, the patient was transiently on
pressors. She was extubated and noted to have wheezes; per
report she had splinting and labored breathing. An ABG at this
time showed slight respiratory acidosis with 7.24/56/91. Patient
then underwent chest x-ray that showed no pneumothorax and no
evidence of focal infiltrate. Per report, there was concern
about worsening respiratory status which is why the patient was
transferred to the ICU. Currently, she has central access via an
IJ line, and also peripheral access. There is a chest tube on
the right, and an NG tube that should be placed to low-wall
suction overnight. Per report, she is alert and oriented to
person and place, but slightly delirious. Her vitals at time of
transfer are HR 79, BP 113/57, satting 98% 10L, breathing at
35/m.

ROS: currently, patient endorses mild pain at the surgical site.
Her breathing feels okay. She denies fever, chills, or sputum
production.

Past Medical History:
- Pheochromocytoma - resection [**2133-1-5**]
- Polychondritis
- Mild COPD
- Hypertension
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Appendectomy
- Tubal Ligation

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 3844**]. They have
three children. Her daughter is a nurse. She has been smoking
long term, but stopped smoking the day prior to this visit and
has a desire to quit. She drinks up to four beers daily.

Family History:
Mother had cancer, unknown primary. Daughter, benign breast
mass.

Physical Exam:
General: sleeping but arousable, oriented, no respiratory
distress
Vitals: T 96.6, HR 81, BP 123/46, satting 99% on
CVP: [**11-3**]
HEENT: non-icteric sclera, moist mucus membranes
Neck: supple, no jugular venous distention
Heart: regular rate and rhythm, normal s1/s2
Lungs: diffuse coarse inspiratory sounds, good air movement,
faint scattered expiratory wheezes
Abdomen: moderate tenderness over right upper quadrant, near
area of surgical site
Extremities: warm, well-perfused, non-edematous

Imaging:

Chest x-ray ([**2133-1-5**]): In comparison with study of [**11-13**],
there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip
approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends
well into the stomach. Right IJ catheter extends to the lower
portion of the SVC. There is a right chest tube in place and no
evidence of pneumothorax. Patchy area of increased opacification
at the left base most likely represents atelectasis, though in
the appropriate clinical situation, pneumonia would have to be
considered. Of incidental note is subcutaneous gas along the
right lateral chest and upper abdomen wall. Multiple surgical
clips in the upper abdomen on the right, and a well-marginated
apparent lesion in the proximal humerus that is probably of no
clinical significance.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary a 59-year-old woman with history of mild COPD and
right pheochromocytoma admitted to urology service after
undergoing right adrenalectomy.  Please see operative not for
full detail.  She was admitted to the medical ICU
post-operatively for close respiratory monitoring given concern
of worsening hypercarbia post-extubation.

# Hypercarbia, wheezing on exam: patient with wheezes on exam.
Ddx includes COPD versus cardiogenic wheezes from pulmonary
edema, likely compounded by splinting related to pain from
recent surgery. Suspect COPD and splinting as the main causes
for impaired ventilation given her relatively normal
echocardiogram in [**2123**] and no signs of decompensated CHF on
exam. Notably, the patient is 6 liters positive after
perioperative fluid resuscitation. BNP was checked and was less
than 400. Patient was treated with albuterol and ipratropium
nebs at scheduled dosing and fluticasone inhaler twice daily. A
repeated arterial blood gas after one treatment with
bronchodilators showed improved ventilation with resolution of
the respiratory acidosis. She was monitored overnight in the
medical ICU and there were no significant events. A repeat chest
x-ray in the morning showed evidence of atelectasis.  Her
respiratory function improved throughout the hospitalization and
she will continue flovent and albuterol inhalers and follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**3-27**] weeks.

# S/p right adrenalectomy: Pain control with morphine PCA
overnight, with Tylenol and ketorolac as needed. Patient was
treated with four doses of prophylactic clindamycin
post-operatively.  Her blood pressure was within normal limits
and was stable throughout hospitalization.  Her blood pressure
medications were held.

# Hyperlipidemia: no active issues. Home pravastatin was resumed
when patient's diet was advanced.

At discharge, patient's pain was controlled on oral pain meds,
tolerating a regular diet, and was ambulating.  She will have
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3540**], and her PCP.
