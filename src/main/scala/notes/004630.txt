Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
male with coronary artery disease, status post left anterior
descending stent in [**2119**], peripheral vascular disease, status
post aortobifemoral bypass and status post femoral-femoral
bypass in [**2123-11-5**] who post procedure had loose
bloody diarrhea.  A sigmoidoscopy was performed in [**2123-11-5**] which was consistent with ischemic colitis.  Patient
was discharged to a rehabilitation facility and returned on
[**2123-12-17**] with persistent diarrhea, with creatinine
elevation to 1.2 (baseline creatinine 0.7), and dehydration.
Patient initially was admitted to the Surgical Service and
was treated for his diarrhea, which was presumed to be
ischemic colitis with loperamide, and the patient was also
placed on prophylactic antibiotics with levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  The patient was given intravenous fluids for his
dehydration and presumed prerenal condition.  However, the
patient became fluid overloaded on [**2123-12-20**] and was
noted to have rales on exam.  The patient was then diuresed
with Lasix and hydrochlorothiazide but continued to remain in
congestive heart failure.  Of note, the patient also has a
history of atrial fibrillation and received Coumadin during
his hospital stay with an elevated INR at 5.0.  The patient
was intermittently reversed with Vitamin K and the warfarin
was discontinued transiently in order to allow his INR to
drift back to therapeutic state.

The patient's diarrhea has improved with loperamide, and
clostridium difficile toxin is negative.  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Service on [**2123-12-27**] for
further management of his congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure:  The patient
was thought to be in mild failure secondary to diastolic
dysfunction.  Patient had an echocardiogram performed
recently at Newborn [**Hospital **] Hospital which revealed an
ejection fraction of approximately 50-55% with no significant
wall motion abnormality.  A chest x-ray was obtained which
showed congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural
effusions and atelectasis.  A repeat chest x-ray obtained
upon further diuresis revealed a right upper lobe airspace
opacity which was thought to be either secondary to
asymmetric pulmonary edema or questionable pneumonia,
however, the patient did not have any signs or symptoms of
pneumonia to suggest that the patient had an infection.
Patient was diuresed with Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. and responded
well.  Patient also was continued on an ACE inhibitor during
his hospital stay, as well as Lopressor.  In terms of the
patient's coronary artery disease, the patient was continued
on his cardiac regimen of aspirin, Lopressor, ACE inhibitor,
and Imdur.  The patient also has a history of atrial
fibrillation and was continued on his digoxin.  Warfarin was
again re-administered and INR levels were followed closely
since the Levaquin elevated the INR level.  Patient required
2 mg of warfarin on Monday, Friday and Saturday.  This
regimen will be continued upon discharge from the hospital.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient with ischemic colitis causing
diarrhea which was improved on a regimen of Imodium q. 2
hours prn diarrhea, as well as started on levofloxacin and
Flagyl for prophylaxis per the Surgical Team.  The patient's
diarrhea stabilized to approximately two to four bowel
movements a day.  These movements are grossly nonbloody and
the patient denies any abdominal pain or discomfort.  The
patient should continue the levofloxacin and the Flagyl
antibiotic prophylaxis until he follows up with Surgery as an
outpatient.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's oxygenation status remained
stable on 3.5 liters with an oxygen saturation of
approximately 92-95%.  It is thought that the patient's
oxygen requirement is likely secondary to a combination of
congestive heart failure, as well as atelectasis.  As noted
above, a chest x-ray was obtained which revealed an opacity
in the right upper lobe which was either secondary to
asymmetric pulmonary edema or anomic infiltrate.  However,
since the patient did not clinically seem to have any signs
of pneumonia, no antibiotics were started.  In addition, the
patient remained afebrile and had no sputum production or
cough.  The patient was encouraged to do incentive spirometer
and continued diuresis should help with his oxygenation.

4.  Renal:  The patient's renal function remained stable with
initiation of diuresis.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient was noted to have elevated blood
sugars during his hospital stay ranging from 150 to 250.  The
patient was started on q.i.d. fingersticks and a regular
insulin sliding scale.  It is possible that the patient
likely has new onset of diabetes mellitus.   This should be
followed up as an outpatient.

6.  Psychiatry:  The patient's family requested that the
patient have a Psychiatry Consult given his lack of
motivation and depressed mood.  Psychiatry was consulted and
felt that the patient had an adjustment disorder and
instituted a behavior plan which consisted of the patient's
sitting up in bed for breakfast and lunch, patient lying in
bed between breakfast and lunch and from lunch to 3 p.m.  The
patient also should participate in Physical Therapy at a
predetermined appointment to be set by the physical
therapist.  In addition, psychiatry recommended for his
depressed mood, that patient be started on Remeron 7.5 mg po
q.h.s., as well as Ritalin 5 mg po b.i.d. to help stimulate
his energy.  The patient seemed to be tolerating both of
these medications well.
