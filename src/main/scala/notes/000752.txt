Imaging;
[**2161-8-30**] EKG:Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats.
Low QRS voltages throughout. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities
grossly unchanged from previous tracing.
.
[**2161-8-30**] CHest AP: As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is minimal increase in transparency of the lung parenchyma,
potentially reflecting improved ventilation.  At the right lung
base, however, a combination of pleural effusion and parenchymal
opacity persists.  These changes might be consistent with
pneumonia.  The changes have neither increased nor decreased in
severity and extent as compared to the previous examination.
A prexeisting retrocardiac atelectasis is less severe than on
the previous image. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged
course and position of a nasogastric tube.
.
[**2161-8-31**] TTE: Small to moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-8-18**],
the pericardial effusion is larger. If clinically indicated,
serial evaluation is suggested.
.
[**2161-8-31**] RUQ U/S:  Echogenic liver consistent with fatty
infiltration.  Other forms of liver disease, including more
significant hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, or steatohepatitis,
cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. No evidence
of biliary obstruction.  Stones and gallbladder sludge, but no
evidence of acute cholecystitis. Increasing splenomegaly, 15.5
cm (13.1 cm on [**8-12**]). Trace left-sided pleural effusion.
.
[**2161-9-1**] CT Torso: Worsening right lower lobe consolidation,
superimposed on post-radiation changes, with trace right and
small left simple pleural effusions. Differential considerations
include increasing atelectasis or scarring, versus possibly
superimposed infection. Moderate pericardial effusion, increased
somewhat. Heterogeneous hepatic perfusion consistent with the
history of hepatitis. Cholelithiasis without evidence of
cholecystitis.
.
[**2161-9-2**] CT Head:No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage; given the
patient's history of malignancy, if metastases are of a concern,
MR is more sensitive in detecting small metastatic lesions
.
[**2161-9-4**] LENI Scan: No bilateral lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.  Extensive superficial soft tissue edema.
.
[**2161-9-7**] CXR Portable: enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions
with compressive atelectasis at the bases. Intestinal tube
remains in position




Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old woman with past medical history of lung cancer s/p
chemotherpay and radiation 3 years prior, and alcohol abuse with
acute alcoholic hepatitis recently admitted with it, who
returned with worsening diarrhea and found to have worsening
liver function and renal function and respiratory status despite
treatment who changed her goals of care to comfort measures only
given her poor prognosis and is discharged home with hospice.

Active Issues:
#Alcoholic hepatitis: Pt returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for worsening
fatigue, lethargy, and diarrhea after being discharged 5 days
prior. There was no significant
