Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service on
[**2174-4-4**] for pre-operative planning. In anticipation of the
surgery, the patient underwent diagnostic abdominal aortogram
with pelvic arteriogram with pre and post hydration with
discontinuation of patient's home lasix. The following morning,
on the day of planned surgical resection, the patient was noted
to be tachypnic, hypertensive, hypoxic and agitated with rales
[**12-7**] way up her lung fields, consistent with pulmonary edema. The
surgery was cancelled given decompensated CHF requiring a
non-rebreather. The patient received 20mg IV lasix x 2, was
transferred to the PACU with improvement in O2 requirements to >
95% on 2L NC. The patient was then transferred to the medical
service for management of CHF and medical optimization prior to
possible repeat attempt for surgery.  Pain service was consulted
and a tunneled epidural catheter was placed for pain control.

She was optimized medically for one week and on [**4-13**], she
underwent resection of her right groin sarcoma without
complications.  Vascular surgery was not needed as the tumor was
resected off the femoral vessels without the need for bypass.
Plastic surgery applied a gracilis flap over the femoral
vessels.  Post-operatively, internal medicine was consulted to
help manage her fluid status.  She did extremely well
post-operatively.  Her epidural was discontinued a few days
after the procedure and she had good pain control on oral pain
medications.  Her foley catheter was removed on post-operative
day number five.  She worked with physical and occupational
therapy.  She was discharged in stable condition to rehab on
post-operative day number six.

Due to the drain output of 20 cc over 24 hours, plastic surgery
service decided to keep the drain in place at the time of
discharge for plan to record drain amounts at rehab then return
to plastic surgery (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) in 1 week for removal of
the drain.  It was also decided by them to keep her on oral
keflex to prevent infection while the drain is in place.
