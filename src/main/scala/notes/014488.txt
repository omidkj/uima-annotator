Cardiac catheterization:
1. Selective angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe
native 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
obstructive
lesions. The LAD was totally occluded proximally. The LCX had a
60%
stenosis at the OM1. The RCA was not engaged as it was known to
be
occluded.
2. Selective graft angiography revealed a 95% ISRS of teh
proximal
SVG--> RCA stent with 80% in distal graft and serial 60 and 70%
lesions
after the RCA anastamosis. The AVG-->LAD was not engaged as it
was known
to be occluded.
3. Resting hemodyncamics revealed elevated left sided filling
pressures
and a low cardiac output. Systemic pressures were preserved.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
5. The lesions in the SVG to the RCA were predilated with a 3.5
X 15mm
Maverick balloon, stented with two 3.5 X 33mm Cypher stents and
post
dilated with a 4.0 X 28mm High sail balloon with lesion
reduction from
95% to 10%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no
residual
stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
.
[**2130-6-8**]-ECHO: Ejection Fraction: 30% to 40%. The left atrium is
mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are  normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction
30-40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the
interventricular septum and inferior free wall; the lateral wall
contracts normally. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiac:
-Ischemia: Diffuse CAD, with occluded SVG to LAD and reperfused
SVG to RCA with two DESs. Given ASA 325, Clopidogrel 75,
Lisinopril 5, Atorvastatin 80; Acebutolol was given as beta
blocker after EP's recommendations. Troponins and CKs were
followed and peaked at 3.15 and 521, respectively.
-Pump: Right heart cath showed CO 3.48, CI 2.09, wedge of 22.
Echo showed moderately depressed EF (30-40%)
-Rhythm: Seen by EP for runs of brady/tachycardia. They
recommended acebutolol for beta blockade given CAD. They said
there was no indication for pacemaker. Pt likely has
intermittent wandering atrial pacemaker and multifocal atrial
tachycardia or lone atrial tachycardia.
.
#. Renal: Baseline Cr 0.9. No significant change during
hospitlization.
.
#. GI: h/o GIB. Kept on pantoprazole 40 mg PO qd. Pt also has a
history of Hepatitis C. Please follow her liver enzymes closely
as she has been started on atorvastatin 80 mg PO qd.
