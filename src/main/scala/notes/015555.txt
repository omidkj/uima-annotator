History of Present Illness:
20 year old previously healthy female admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
fever, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient initially developed
symptoms including ear pain and sore throat 6 days prior to
admission that were treated supportively by her doctor [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 82853**]e and motrin. Her symptoms did not improve, and 3 days
prior to admission she represented to her PCP with continued
sore throat and was rapid Strep negative. The same day she
developed fever and had one episode of non-bloody non-bilious
emesis. Two days prior to admission she was febrile to 103.9
with associated rigors and multiple episodes of non-bloody
non-bilious emesis continuing until today when she presented to
an outside hospital emergency department. Over this same period
of time the patient developed a headache described as throbbing
"all over" with photosensitivity and phonophobia. She also
endorsed orthostasis and shortness of breath only when she had
rigors. When she presented to the outside hospital emergency
department, given concern for meningitis, she received 2 grams
ceftriaxone and a subsequent LP that was negative. She was also
noted to have a hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 3.4, direct 2.4) and a
right upper quadrant ultrasound that was concerning for
gallbladder thickening. She then received ampicillin/sulbactam
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible ERCP. En route, the
patient was noted by EMS to have a new supplemental oxygen
requirement with a oxygen saturation in the mid-80s on RA.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 102.8 100/49 155 18 98%4L nc. The
patient on arrival was noted to have a diffusely tender abdomen
with rebound concerning for an acute abdomen. A CT torso and
right upper quadrant ultrasound were notable for gallbladder
sludge but no other acute pathology. Surgery was also consulted
with no surgical intervention at this time. The patient was also
intermitently hypoxic, and a CTA chest was negative for PE or
dissection, but was notable for scattered ground glass opacities
and nodules with a possible small right upper lobe cavitary lung
lesion. Labs were notable for platelets 60, INR 1.5, microcytic
anemia, and a normal WBC but bandemia of 29%. The patient
received doxycycline and azithromycin, 6 L IVF, and was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient states that she has an
improved headache and abdominal pain. Denies any CP/SOB, n/v/d,
palpitations, dysuria, trismus. Denies any sick contacts.

INDICATION: Hypoxia, fever, shortness of breath, evaluate for
PE.

COMPARISON: Plain film from [**2142-7-18**].

TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained through the
chest after the uneventful administration of 130 ml of Optiray
intravenously. Further imaging was obtained through the abdomen
and pelvis. Multiplanar reformations were derived.

FINDINGS: There is no pathologic axillary adenopathy. There are
no
pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes. Small prevascular
paratracheal
nodes are seen. The pulmonary artery measures 2.1 cm, normal.
There is no
pulmonary embolus, although evaluation of subsegmental arteries
may be
slightly limited. The aorta is normal in caliber and course.
There is no
aortic dissection. The heart is normal in size. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Central airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi.
There is
