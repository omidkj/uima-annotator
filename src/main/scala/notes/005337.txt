ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed a pleasant and cooperative.  In no acute distress.
Mucous membranes were moist.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs.  The abdomen was soft and nondistended.
Bilateral upper quadrant tenderness.  No rebound.  No
guarding.  A well-healed right perimedial scar.  Extremities
were warm and well perfused.  No edema.  Rectal examination
was guaiac-positive.  Hemorrhoids were noted.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
slight elevation ST segment in V1 and V2 and V3.  Lower
narrow complex tachycardia in V4, V5, and V6.

An upright chest x-ray revealed no free air.

A computed tomography scan was suspicious for a small-bowel
obstruction.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for
cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Service for a questionable small-bowel obstruction.

Given the patient's history and electrocardiogram changes, a
Cardiology consultation was obtained who stated that the
patient was a reasonable risk for surgery.  Her hard to
control blood pressure could be due to renovascular
hypertension.  She was a reasonable risk for surgery.  Per
Cardiology, her medications should be started after the
surgery when feasible.

The Renal Service was also consulted who stated history was
not very consistent with renovascular hypertension, although
it was very difficult to figure perioperatively.  Their
recommendation was to proceed with surgery if necessary, and
if a further workup is needed it would be done on an
outpatient basis.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2193-3-31**]
where lysis of adhesions and internal hernia reduction was
performed.  Please see the Operative Note for details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On postoperative day one, the patient received a double dose
of levofloxacin and Flagyl perioperatively and was
successfully extubated.  During the next few days in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient remained stable.  There was
some difficulty controlling her blood pressure which was in
the high 80s and was controlled with intravenous Lopressor.
The patient had some difficulty breathing, consistent with
her previous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma
exacerbations.  The patient was complaining of abdominal
pain.  No flatus.

On postoperative day five, the patient was afebrile.  Her
vital signs were stable.  Her blood pressure was between 140
and 150.  The patient had an oxygen requirement.  The patient
had bilateral wheezing and occasional attacks of shortness of
breath, which were controlled with albuterol nebulizers.  No
flatus.  The patient's urine output was good.  It was decided
to start the patient of intravenous Lasix for pulmonary
edema.  The patient responded to Lasix very well with
diuresis.

On postoperative day six, the patient was afebrile.  Her
vital signs were stable.  She was placed on twice per day
diuresis.  Still no gas.  Given it had almost been one week,
she was started on total parenteral nutrition.  A
peripherally inserted central catheter line was also ordered
and was placed on postoperative day seven.

In the meantime, the patient actually started to pass gas.
She was slowly advanced from sips to soft solids on
postoperative day nine which she tolerated well.  Her
respiratory status had improved.  She did not have an oxygen
requirement anymore.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.

On postoperative day ten, the patient was afebrile.  Her
vital signs were stable.  She was ambulating with Physical
Therapy.  She was passing gas.  She was tolerating a soft
diabetic diet.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Her abdomen was minimally tender and
nondistended.  Her wound was clean, dry, and intact.  No
edema.  Total parenteral nutrition was discontinued.  No
concerns.  No active issues at this time.
