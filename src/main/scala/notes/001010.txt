History of Present Illness:
PCP: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1528**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD ([**Hospital **] Community Health Center)
.
HPI: 43 y.o. M with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, bipolar
disease, and asthma admitted on [**2131-3-23**] to Psychiatry after an
episode of mania after an argument with his mother. [**Name (NI) **]
wanted to be evaluated for medication change. Per report in the
ED, he was irritable and responding to internal stimuli, but
denies AH and VH. ED VS: 98.9 HR 80 BP 150/76 RR 19 and 95% RA.
While on the Pyschiatry service, he slowly improved with his
psychiatric medications. On the day of transfer to the MICU
team, at 4:50 PM, he was noted to be difficult to be aroused and
required sternal rub to awaken. An ABG was drawn that showed
respiratory acidosis (7.23/92/55/41). The patient was on 4 L O2
via NC with O2 sat of 83%. Bipap was initiated, and his O2 sat
was 93%. He denied SOB or pain at that time. Of note, PC02 at
baseline is 55-60. At home his Bipap is 16/12 @ 4L O2 at night
with 2 L O2 during the day.
.
On the psych floor patient was switched from 2L o2 to 4L because
patient was thought to be hypoxic. This led to patient becoming
hypercapneic and lethargic ABG : 7.23/92/55/41. Pt was
transferred to the MICU place on BiPap where his gas improved to
7.36/74/54. This is near his baseline per pulm notes.
.
Pulm notes state that patient is supposed to be on 4L oxygen at
home. He states that he wears 2L oxygen at home and that he has
not been wearing his bipap at home, because his mask recently
broke.

CXR: [**3-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Although smaller lung volumes exaggerate heart size
and pulmonary vascular crowding, since [**1-26**] there has
been an increase in moderate cardiomegaly, and vascular
congestion in both the lungs and mediastinum just to the point
of interstitial edema. There is no appreciable pleural effusion.

[**2131-3-27**]: ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function
PFT [**2131-3-1**]
Dx: Dyspnea. Good test quality and fair reproducibility.
Medications:
Flovent, Atrovent.
Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are moderately reduced. The FEV1/FVC
ratio is normal.
Flow-Volume Loop: Restrictive contour.
.
Impression: Results are consistent with a restrictive
ventilatory defect, which is confirmed by the reduced TLC
measured on [**2129-10-10**]. Compared to the prior study of [**2131-1-25**]
the FVC has increased by 0.56 L (37%) and the FEV1 has increased
by 0.24 L (18%).

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 43 y/o AAM w/ schizoaffective d/o, sleep apnea,
asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, on home o2 of 2L,
bipap at night, w/ polycythemia likely [**3-3**] to hypoxemia,
originally admitted for mania, transferred to micu for
hypercapneic resp failure, transferred to general medicine wards
for further management of pulm issues.
.
PROBLEMS:
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Per pulmonary, most likely
secondary to either decreased resp drive from increasing patient
supplemental oxygen to quickly suppressing his respiratory drive
or secondary to lack of proper bipap settings. Patient had
desaturated down to 70s while in inpatient psych facility. ACS
was ruled out as a cause of resp failure. Patients baseline
saturations on high 80s on 2L/NC on home o2. Patient was seen by
the sleep consultants who felt that his bipap should be set as
follows. Baseline sat 78-85 on RA per OMR.
--Bipap used every night and w/ daytime naps, setting 16/12 w/
Oxygen 2L, titrated to sats above 85-90%.
--Keep oxygen saturations between 85 and 90%.
--During the day patient should be on n/c oxygen 2-4L titrate
again sats btw 85-90%.
--Avoid given supplement oxygen above 4L n/c, if needed while in
house please reconsult pulmonary medicine and check ABG.
--cont albuterol and ipratroprium standing nebulizers q6H. [**Month (only) 116**]
switch back to inhalers as desired.
--cont fluticasone as prescribed.
.
# Asthma( see above)
.
# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: (See above) Patient needs follow up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in sleep clinic. He was evaluated by ENT for
tonisellectomy. ENT felt tonsillectomy was not necessary at this
time, but that pt may benefit from procedure at a later date.
Sleep team felt that amphetamines or stimulants for daytime
sleepiness were not indicated at this time.
.
# Secondary Polycythemia: Seen by heme consult serv
