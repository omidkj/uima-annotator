Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for MGUS,
hypertension, atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypercholesterolemia, who
presents with abdominal pain with abdominal distention,
decreased po intake for the last three days.  Patient denies
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Last bowel
movement was approximately 2-3 days prior to admission.
The caretaker for Ms. [**Known lastname 100214**] also noticed increased
confusion.

The patient was initially admitted on [**12-12**] to
[**2138-12-15**] status post fall, which was thought to be
mechanical in nature.  Since the fall, patient has become
progressively more confused and lethargic with decreased po
intake.  The patient was readmitted on [**12-23**] to [**12-26**] with increased confusion which was attributed to
narcotics and benzodiazepines given at the nursing home in
addition to a multi-drug resistant urinary tract infection
which was treated with ceftriaxone.

More recently, the patient was noted to have a right lower
lobe pneumonia at the nursing home, for which she was started
on ceftriaxone again on [**12-30**].  During the most recent
admission, patient was noted to have increased LFTs, ALT of
187, AST of 182, alkaline phosphatase of 460, T bilirubin of
0.8.  An ultrasound at that time revealed sludge in the
gallbladder, but a normal liver.  Patient was to have a
followup ultrasound to be re-evaluated in the near future.

for the last 35 years.  No history of drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 100.2, blood
pressure 153/75, heart rate 117, respiratory rate 23, and O2
sat is 99% on 2 liters.  General:  Patient is an elderly
woman lying in bed in no apparent distress, appears quite
confused, and was speaking in full sentences.  HEENT:
Bilateral surgical pupils consistent with cataract surgery.
Sclerae are anicteric.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous
membranes slightly dry.  Cardiac:  Positive S1, S2, regular,
rate, and rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur left sternal
border.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, slightly distended, positive diffuse
tenderness especially in the right upper quadrant.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic:

disoriented to place and time, full range of motion x4
extremities.

LABORATORIES:  White count 19.1, hematocrit 38.7, platelets
369, MCV of 91, neutrophils 82.7, lymphocytes 9.6, monocytes
5.6, eosinophils 0.8, basophils 0.2.  Sodium 129, potassium
3.8, chloride 93, bicarb 27, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose
of 102.  Urinalysis was yellow clear, specific gravity 1.010,
negative for blood, nitrate, protein, glucose, ketones, small
bilirubin 0 red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, rare
bacteria.

CHEST X-RAY:  Appearance of retrocardiac density, but not
commented on the official report.

KUB:  Noted for stool.

In addition, gallbladder ultrasound is performed, study was
limited secondary to increased gas, but there was noted to be
some slight gallbladder wall thickening 4-6 mm, possibility
of stones, but no pericholecystic fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to patient's abdominal distention,
diffuse tenderness, and former history of possible
gallbladder stones/sludge, there is a concern for
cholecystitis or cholangitis.  Patient was started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics including intravenous ampicillin,
gentamicin, and Flagyl.  A repeat ultrasound was obtained in
the morning, which did not demonstrate any biliary duct
dilation, no cholecystitis, and no liver abnormalities were
commented on.

Patient was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics
regardless, through which time she remained afebrile and her
white count began to trend downward.  Due to the large amount
of stools noted, patient was started on an aggressive bowel
regimen with relief of abdominal pain as well as some of the
abdominal distention.

An abdominal CT scan was obtained to determine that there is
no intraabdominal pathology, of note only diverticulosis was
seen, but no evidence of diverticulitis.  In the lung bases,
there was evidence for pneumonia, so the patient was again
determined to stay on the broad-spectrum antibiotics.  The
abdominal pain regressed throughout the hospital course, the
patient was able to tolerate po within a few days without any
difficulty.  She did have diarrhea, for which stool cultures
and Clostridium difficile specimens were sent, all remained
negative throughout her stay.

Of note, her LFTs had been elevated on prior admissions, and
the alkaline phosphatase continued to trend upward throughout
her stay.  At the time of dictation on [**1-11**], an ERCP
or MRCP were being considered for possible evaluation for
sclerosing cholangitis or biliary cirrhosis.  It may need to
be followed up as an outpatient.

Mental status changes:  As patient's white count trended
downward, and biliary patency, abdominal pain was corrected,
the patient's mental status improved, with more clear source
of the cause.  Patient's electrolytes were monitored closely,
and all sources of infection were monitored.  The only
obvious source became the pneumonia which was first noted on
CT scan of the abdomen, in addition to followup chest x-rays
that were obtained.  As the patient was transitioned from IV
ampicillin, gentamicin, and Flagyl, the patient was continued
on levofloxacin po to treat the pneumonia.

Of note, patient still had episodes of confusion, primarily
at night, no real agitation, just disorientation, which was
treated with Haldol prn.  Due to a concern of mental status
changes, in addition to history of atrial fibrillation and
being admitted with a subtherapeutic INR, a MRI of the brain,
according to the stroke protocol, was performed, which did
not show any evidence of an acute intracranial process.

An electroencephalogram was also obtained in order to rule
out any small seizure foci, the electroencephalogram was only
consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.  An ammonia level
was obtained, which was elevated, but hepatology serologies
were negative, therefore it was unlikely to be a hepatic
encephalopathy.  The patient was treated with lactulose tid.

Also during the course of her stay, the patient's heart rate
was noted to be elevated in the low 100s, occasionally 120s,
and electrocardiograms were consistent with recurrent atrial
fibrillation.  Patient was briefly stopped on amiodarone due
to the increasing LFTs, but it was determined that the
amiodarone was the unlikely source of the LFT elevation,
since she had been on it for a long period of time prior to
the LFTs rise.  Thus, she was continued on the amiodarone.

Instead, the verapamil that she had been taking, was slowly
titrated up for appropriate control.  Due to the concern of
prolonged tachycardia, potential of cardiomyopathy in the
setting patient was given 20 mg of intravenous verapamil on
[**1-10**] with a decrease of the rate to the low 90s.  Patient
remains in the 90s for most of the day.  It will be necessary
to continue to titrate up the verapamil for better rate
control.

In addition, due
