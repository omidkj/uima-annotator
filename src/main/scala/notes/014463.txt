Chief Complaint:
Cycle #1 ICE for relapsed DLBCL.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74yo man with CAD/CHF, DM, HTN, CKD, COPD, and
relapsed DLBCL admitted for cycle #1 ICE salvage.  He received
rituximab [**2175-3-21**].  Previously he was treated with 6 cycles of
R-CHOP finishing 1/[**2174**].  Several months later, he relapsed in
the same site (temples) with nodules.  He was then placed on
clindamycin, but more nodules appeared.  He then had a biopsy
which confirmed relapse, so presents today to start salvage
chemotherapy.  He was recently taken off atenolol because of
bradycardia.  A recent stress test and echo was suggestive for
inferior wall ischemia, yet his cardiologist has cleared him to
proceed with chemo.
.
ROS: He denies fatigue, F/C/S, wght loss, N/V, headache,
dizziness, visual changes, hearing changes, chest pain, dyspnea,
cough, abdominal pain, back pain, diarrhea, constipation,
hematochezia, melena, hematuria, other urinary symptoms,
paresthesias, or rash.  All other ROS were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
74M with previously noted SSS and relapsed DLBCL undergoing
active chemotherapy with ICE on the oncology service, who was
incidentally noted to have asymptomatic sinus bradycardia to the
20s with occassional sinus pauses, as well as afib and SVT.
.
# Sick sinus syndrome: On [**2175-4-1**], the pt had asymptomatic sinus
brady to 30s (pauses up to 2.2s). Then on [**2175-4-2**] (~7AM), he
developed sinus brady to ~20 bpm, asymptomatic with sBPs >130s.
Later in the morning (~11AM), after being given IV lasix, he
developed SVT (appears to be AF with occasional sinus beats)
with a ventricular rate in the 140s. This was controlled
somewhat with 2.5mg IV metoprolol with HR in the 120s. At ~3PM,
he developed SVT to 240s for 1-2 minutes; remained asymptomatic
with high or normal sBPs throughout. Was given low-dose BB. Had
already broken into SVT in 120s. Then he developed sinus rhythm
in 30s-40s with frequent up to 3 sec pauses. During transport to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] CCU, the pt had several runs of VT up to
20beats. Was evaluated by EP.  Patient did not have pacemaker
placed in the setting of immunosuppression.  In house, patient
tolerated a beta blocker well and was discharged on metoprolol
XL.  He will follow up with cardiology as outpatient.
.
# Relapsed DLBCL: Planning for 2 cycles of ICE followed by
autoBMT. Cardiology previously cleared pt to start chemotherapy
despite echo and stress test findings.  Started on neupogen.
Started cycle #1 ICE: Ifosfamide 1500mg/m2 Days 1/2/3 (dose
reduced 25% for CKD), mesna 500mg/m2 q3hr x4 doses Days 1/2/3,
carboplatin AUC5 Day 1, and etoposide 75mg/m2 Days 1/2/3 (dose
reduced 25% for CKD). Patient was monitored daily for tumor
lysis syndrome.  Continued acyclovir and bactrim for ppx. Was
discharged on neupogen.  Will f/u with heme/onc as outpatient.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC on [**4-4**] was 20, thought [**12-29**] neupogen. No
fevers or obvious sign of infection.
.
# CAD: Tolerated low dose metoprolol.  Continued home
lisinopril, aspirin, hctz.
.
#Allergic reaction: While on Onc floor, pt developed an acute
allergic reaction with hives accompanied by afib with RVR and
HTN, thought to be [**12-29**] po lasix.  Was treated with benadryl,
famotidine, steroids.
.
#Acute Diastolic Dysfunction: Appeared euvolemic at present.
Re-started HCTZ.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# CKD: Chemo dose-reduced accordingly.  Trended Cr
.
# COPD: noted in previous notes;
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continue outpatient atorvastatin.
.
# DM:  Held glipizide and acarbose in house. Covered with
insulin sliding scale.
.
# BPH: Continue outpatient doxazosin.
.
# Pain: None currently. Coverwith Acetaminophen, oxycodone PRN.
