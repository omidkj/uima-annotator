Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2126-2-19**]  10:27:38 AM
Baseline artifact. Leads VI and V5-V6 were not recorded. Sinus
rhythm.
Borderline left axis deviation. Cannot exclude prior inferior
wall myocardial
infarction. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Anterior T
wave inversions
raise consideration of ischemia, etc. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2126-1-10**] atrial ectopy is not seen without overall diagnostic
change in the
leads recorded. Clinical correlation is suggested.

BX-NEEDLE LIVER BY RADIOLOGIST  [**2126-2-19**] 7:54 AM
IMPRESSION: Ultrasound-guided biopsy of a heterogenous lesion in
segment 6 previously seen on ultrasound and MRI. A total of
three core biopsies were obtained. No immediate post-procedure
complications were observed; however, the patient experienced
hypotension while being monitored after the procedure in the
daycare unit and was sent to the emergency room after a Code was
called . There is evidence of a subcapsular hematoma on fast
scan and CT scan of the abdomen was then performed to evaluate
the amount of hemorrhage.
.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2126-2-19**] 11:06 AM
IMPRESSION: Right-sided pleural densities and atelectasis in
right lower lobe area, stable in comparison with the previous
examination of [**2126-2-1**]. No new acute findings. No
pneumothorax.
.
.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2126-2-19**] 11:07 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-sized perihepatic extracapsular hematoma with
posterior area of active extravasation. This extravasation
appears to be arising from vessels associated with hypervascular
lesion at the inferior right lobe of the liver (biopsied earlier
today) with clot formation adjacent to this lesion.
2. Four rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which are likely
metastases.
3. Left lower pole renal cell carcinoma.
4. New 18 x 18 mm left lower lobe pleural-based mass, which is
concerning for metastasis given that it was not present on prior
chest CT from [**2125-10-12**]. Recommend dedicated chest CT to
evaluate for additional lesions.
5. Right-sided pleural effusions including a loculated anterior
effusion and layering posterior effusion with compressive
atelectasis. Status post right- sided pleurodesis.
6. Adrenal adenoma.
7. Sclerotic and mottled appearance of right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], which
may represent early Paget's disease or less likely a focus of
metastasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1388**] Transplant surgery service
after a liver hemorrhage status post a liver biopsy. The patient
was initially admitted to the S-ICU where he had imaging (please
see reports as above). He had a major drop in his hematocrit
from 28 to 22 and underwent a CT scan that demonstrated active
extravasation of contrast from the liver bed. The patient was
taken to the operating room for exploration (ex-lap and
cauterization of liver bleed). The patient had no intra or
post-operative complications. He was brought to the PACU in a
stable condition. Cardiac enzymes were drawn for chest
discomfort and the drop in Hct - they were negative and his EKG
was unremarkable. The patient did well overnight. The following
morning, he was started on a clear diet, which was tolerated. He
had no new issues and only complained of a sore throat. The
following day on POD2, the patient was discharged after he was
ambulating and tolerating a regular diet. He had no new issues
and his labwork was stable and within normal limits.
