Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
Urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
61 y/o F w/morbid obesity and IDDM, who initially presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital [**12-27**] with one day of abd pain. She states her
pain was periumbilical, began after eating lunch, and was
associated with nausea and retching but no vomiting. Denied
diarrhea. At [**Hospital1 1474**], she had a temp of 103.9 and a positive
UA, and was given unasyn 3 grams and transferred here for
further management. In our ED her T 100 but then spiked to 103
and SBPs dropped to 70s. She received 3 liters of fluid with
improvement of SBPs to low 100s. Three attempts were made at
central line placement including SC x2 and U/S guided IJ without
success. She was going to be sent for CT to evaluate her
abdominal pain, but this was limited by her size, so a surgical
consult was obtained. The surgical conmsult felt that her
abdominal pain was related to urosepsis and there were no acute
surgical issues.
.
In the ED she received 3.5 liters IVF, levofloxacin 500 mg IV
x1, flagyl 500 mg IV x 1, tylenol 1 g PO x1, anzemet 12.5 mg IV
x1, morphine 4 mg IV x 1, ASA 325 mg x 1. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. While there, she never required pressors. Her
abdominal pain resolved. She was called out to the floor the
next day, as she had remained hemodynamically stable. Her blood
cx grew GNR 2/2 bottles, and she was continued on cipro.
Currently, she states she feels "lousy", but overall is feeling
better since admission. She is also now having dysuria, which
she did not have before. Her abd pain is resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) SEPSIS:
Based on UA, pt had a UTI and this was the source of her sepsis.
 She was initially admitted to the MICU for monitoring.  Her BP
was stable with fluids alone.  She received about 4 liters of
IVF.  She never required vasopressors.  In the ED, she received
levaquin and then was on ciprofloxacin (day 6 of 14 on
discharge).  Her initial urine culture and blood cultures grew
out pansensitive klebsiella.  Her initial symptom of abdominal
pain resolved quickly and fevers also resolved.  Surveillance
blood cultures were negative.  WBC trended down.  Because of
limited mobility at the present time, a Foley catheter was left
in place.
.
2) CHF:
Secondary to fluids received during resuscitation for sepsis the
pt had total body fluid overload with evidence of mild pulmonary
edema on CXR.  She was diuresed with lasix and was on room air,
oxygenating well by discharge.
.
3) HTN:
Pt has no h/o hypertension but after resolution of sepsis, she
was mildly hypertensive on the floor here.  She was started on
low dose lopressor (instead of ACEI due to borderline
tachycardia) with improvement.  Ideally, she should be on an
ACE-I if she continues to require an anti-HTN.
.
4) CAD:
Pt had mild elevation in TnT during sepsis consistent with
demand ischemia in setting of sepsis.  TnT trended down and
there was no evidence of acute coronary sydrome.  Pt was started
on ASA given her DM for cardiac prophylaxis.  She should have
outpt cardiac evaluation ie stress test.
.
5) DIARRHEA:
2 days before discharge, pt had mild diarrhea and abdominal
pain.  According to her, it felt typical of her chronic IBS.
However, given her recent abx a C diff toxin was sent and was
negative.  Her diarrhea resolved as did her abdominal pain.  She
did have known gallstones but on RUQ US no evidence of
cholecystitis.
.
6) DM:
Resumed home regimen of NPH.
.
7) DEPRESSION:
SW and psych saw the patient for depression.  She was started on
celexa but will require outpt psychiatric follow up.
.
8) ARTHRITIS:
Pt had a lot of increased chronic back pain initially due to an
uncomfortable bed.  She was restarted on percocet which she
takes at home and this improved.
.
9) ANEMIA:
Iron studies were consistent with iron defiency and anemia of
chronic disease so she was started on iron supplem.  Hct was
stable in mid 30s.
