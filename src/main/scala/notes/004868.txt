Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with retained common bile duct stone, transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERPC after several failed attempts as OSH, who
became acutely SOB and wheezy en route to ERCP. She likely
develped a COPD flare and improved marginally with nebs and
solumedrol. Discussions with patient and her daughter confirmed
her DNR/DNI status and they decided ultimately to move to
hospice care. She did not have any symptoms of cholangitis but
was continued on unasyn while in house for prophylaxis, related
to her retained biliary stones. She completed a course of
linezolid for a VRE UTI. She also was diagnosed with c diff at
the outside hospital and was maintined on flagyl while in house.
She was not having any further diarrhea. We opted to discontinue
all antibiotics at discharge as she is now comfort measures
only. This is in line with goals of care per the patient and her
daughter. If she can take the prednisone it may help her
respiratory status/COPD flare.
