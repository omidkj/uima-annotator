Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
Rhabdomyolysis, EKG changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intra-aortic balloon pump
Central line
CVVHD
Arterial Line

History of Present Illness:
CCU HPI on [**12-16**]:
82 yo M w/ CAD s/p BMS--> RCA [**2176**], PVD s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] atherectomy,
TIA, carotid artery stenosis, RAS s/p stent, DM2, HTN, prostate
CA s/p brachytherapy w/ recent admission in [**2188-11-12**] for
chest pain, s/p cath showing diffuse 3vd, LMCA 60% stenosis.
Decision was made to proceed with medical management since poor
distal coronary targets and not a good surgical candidate. Pt
sent home on atorvastatin 40mg -->80mg. Few weeks later pt noted
leg cramps. Went to [**Hospital1 882**] on [**12-8**] for likely statin induced
myopathy and found to have elevated CK (8,000), hypertension to
200s, ARF (Cr=3 which is up from baseline 1.7), and
myoglobinuria. Pt was diagnosed with Rhabdomyolysis and given
several liters of fluid. He was then noted to have EKF changes
in lateral leads and rising cardiac enzymes. He was transfered
to [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiothoracic Surgical service for plan of urgent
CABG. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], cardiac enzymes continued to
increase (Trop 0.03-->0.5-->0.75-->0.6-->0.9) with lateral EKG
changes. In addition, pt was not oxygenating well and CXR showed
pulmonary edema. He was intubated for pulm edema and and
intra-aortic balloon pump placed to improve coronary perfusion.
Pt was stable until yesterday morning when he became hypothermic
(T=34) and bradycardic, he was pan-cultured for concern of
sepsis. Cultures are pending. He was also started on milrinone
for low cardiac index and poor urinary output with goal of
improving forward flow and perfusing kidneys. He was also give
lasix 40mg IV once with no response. This morning, he was found
to be in A. fib and was started on amiodarone bolus and drip. Pt
also on heparin gtt for balloon pump and possible ACS event.
.
Unable to obtain ROS since pt is sedated and intubated.

[**2188-12-15**] Renal ultrasound
Limited vascular exam due to artifact from balloon pump.
However, there is little, if any parenchymal flow in arcuate
arteries of both kidneys which may be related to insufficient
perfusion pressure. Flow is detected in the main renal arteries
and veins bilaterally, but there is no appreciable diastolic
flow.
.
[**2188-12-15**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-apical severe
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. with depressed
free wall contractility. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-12-13**],
RV systolic function is less vigorous. The LVEf is similar
on/off IABP.
.
[**2188-12-15**] Carotid study:
1. Near occlusion of the right internal carotid artery,
presenting with a
string sign.
2. 40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. These
results were posted in the radiology critical results
communication dashboard on [**12-11**] at 6:00 p.m.
.
[**2188-12-18**] CT head w/o contrast
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of
normally midline structures. While there is no obvious hypodense
area to suggest an acute infarct, MR of the head can be
considered if there is continued clinical concern and if not
contraindicated. Other details as above.
2. Paranasal sinus and mastoid disease as described above.
Fullness of the nasopharyngeal soft tissues, can be correlated
with ENT examination.
.
.
Ultrasound S/P Balloon Pump [**12-24**]: No fluid collection within
the right groin. No pseudoaneurysm or fistula.
.
[**12-30**]: Liver Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal Doppler
evaluation of the liver. 2. Cholelithiasis and gallbladder
sludge, without evidence of cholecystitis. 3. Right pleural
effusion. 4. Pulsatie portal vein flow may be seen in right
heart failure.
.
[**12-31**] CXR: 1. Worsening opacity at left lower base is fluid,
atelectasis, and possible pneumonia. 2. Worsening pulmonary
venous congestion. 3. Right upper lung opacity, likely artifact.

.
12.03 CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-1**], there
is little change in the appearance of the monitoring and support
devices. The cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal
limits on this study. Right p
