Upon presentation at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] CT
imaging of the brain was performed.  There was no evidence of
acute parenchymal hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, effacement of the basal cisterns, hydrocephalus, or
large vascular territory infarction. Vascular calcifications are
noted along the
carotid siphons. The patient is status post bilateral lens
replacement. No
fracture is seen in the skull. Fluid in the nasopharynx is
likely related to
intubated status. Mucus retention cyst is noted in the right
maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Extra-axial collection along left cerebral convexity
with mixed
attenuation, consistent with acute-on-chronic hemorrhage or
evolving likely
subdural hematoma.

severe articular involvement as well. Rheumatology was consulted
and following this patient. They performed arthrocentesis and
sent fluid for analysis. H/o suspected gout and pt recently
stopped his allopurinol. However, joint fluid consistent with
pseudogout cyrstals and x-ray with chondrocalcinosis supporting
pseudogout. In addition, very bloody fluid with few WBC
concerning for possible traumatic
process given recent fall after seizure. X-ray without fracture
done but not sensitive enough to detect early fracture. Ice,
Elevation and Solumedrol therapy  begun for his knee. Physical
and Occupational therapy consulted and following. Recommend
rehab for continued strengthening and conditioning.
