History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 64-year-old man with a history of prior
left sided stroke with residual right hemiparesis who presents
with ICH. He had a headache yesterday. Today, he was noted by
his
nursing home staff to be more confused, seemingly disoriented to
place and slow in his responses; he was also newly incontinent
of
urine today, and required assistance with feeding. This was a
marked change in functional status, so they sent him by EMS to
[**Hospital6 3105**]. There, a CT showed a 4.8 x 3 cm L
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 7-8 mm of midline
shift.

GCS score there was 14. He was observed to have a 3 minute GTC
seizure while at [**Hospital3 **]. He was given 3 mg IV ativan
and 500 mg IV phenytoin.

He was intubated for airway protection during transport and was
given 10 mg Vec and 100 mg succ at 5 pm, and placed on a
propofol
drip. He was transported by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**].

ROS is not possible.

NCHCT:

1. Interval evolution of the known large superior left frontal
parenchymal
hemorrhage with increased vasogenic edema without mass effect.
No other
hemorrhagic foci or large vascular territorial infarction is
noted.

2. Apparent vasogenic edema in the right parietal-occipital
region, concrning
for PRES. Recommend MRI for further characterization, as
clinical scenario
dictates.



Brief Hospital Course:
Neurologically:  Patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU and had
frequent neuro checks.
Aspirin and Plavix were held.  IV fluids were restricted as
possible and he did not require Mannitol.  Dilantin had already
been administered at the OSH, and he was given an additional
500mg load on arrival to [**Hospital1 **].  Was also started on Maintenance
200 IV BID, which was increased to 200 AM and 250 PM on [**7-25**] as
Dilantin levels were running just slightly subtherapeutic.  Had
no further seizures.  Repeat CT showed no increase in size of
bleed.  MRI was considered, but deferred as patient was
initially not stable enough and later unable to safely cooperate
for study.  Plan is to have repeated in several months time as
out patient.  Neurologically he continues to be anteriorly
aphasic but follows some simple commands, but not complex
commands.  His dense right hemiparesis is unchanged from
admission.

Cardiovascularly: no events

Resp: no events

GI: was initially NPO, but later able to take soft solids.

Renal: no events

ID: no infectious issues

Endocrine: covered with regular insulin sliding scale QID
during.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital1 2670**] - Colonial Heights - [**Hospital1 487**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
old left sided stroke


Discharge Condition:
Fair.  Continues to have dense right hemiparesis.  Anteriorly
aphasic but following some simple commands.


Discharge Instructions:
This patient has had an acute left frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.  This has caused him to be more confused,
disoriented and less responsive than what was described prior.
It also likely led to the seizure which he had at [**Hospital3 12748**].  The hemorrhage has stabilized and his
deficits appear to be improving.  He continues to have language
impairments but follows some simple commands.  He still has a
dense right hemiparesis.  He will need to follow up as below and
will need to continue taking a medication called Dilantin to
stop him from having further seizures.

Followup Instructions:
