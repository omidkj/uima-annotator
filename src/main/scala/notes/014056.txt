HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
83-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation,
hypertension, hypothyroidism, who presented with shortness of
breath and back pain.  The patient was well until four days
ago, when she noted rapid heart rate.  This was accompanied
by whole-body muscle aches.  The patient went to her primary
care physician and after being given medicine she was sent
home.  Later that evening, she had acute onset of sharp pain
in the scapula and back.  The pain was constant, lasting over
the last four days, worse with inspection.  The patient also
felt unsteady, but denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  The
patient was also noted to be increasing shortness of breath
with exertion over the past several days.  The patient cannot
say how long she usually walks, but she feels that it is a
lot less today.  The patient denies shortness of breath at
rest, orthopnea, and nocturnal dyspnea.

Last night, the patient felt symptoms worsen since the
previous two nights.  She could not sleep.  She was scheduled
for an echocardiogram this AM, but deferred to the emergency
department, where she was given 6 mg morphine to treat the
pain.

use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the
following:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 95.2, heart rate 93,
blood pressure 117/68, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation
95% on two liters.  GENERAL:  This is an elderly woman, lying
in bed in no acute distress.  HEENT:  No JVD, no
lymphadenopathy.  Cor:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No edema, 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 10, hematocrit 29.3, platelet count 263,000,
sodium 143, potassium 4.6, chloride 108, CO2 22, BUN 59,
creatinine 1.5, glucose 139, AST 39, ALT 41, alkaline
phosphatase 83, amylase 102, lipase 20, INR 3.3, PTT 33.2,
urinalysis trace ketones and 3+ protein.  Urine toxicity
screen was positive for opiates.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm, PR of 0.214 and QRS of 100.

Echocardiogram done on [**4-6**], showed an EF of 55% with
normal wall motion.  Echocardiogram done on the day of
admission showed 4+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, with normal LV.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Service for rule out myocardial infarction.  Cardiothoracic
Surgery was consulted regarding possible mitral valve
replacement.  At that point, they requested that the patient
be catheterized.  She remained in the hospital due to an
elevated INR, waiting for the INR to become less than 17 so
that she could be catheterized.  On [**7-15**], she was
brought to the catheterization laboratory. (please see
catheterization report for full details).  Summary of the
catheterization showed mildly elevated wedge pressure with
normal EF and 4+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] coronary arteries were widely
patent.  She was also noted to have trace aortic
insufficiency.  Following this study, cardiothoracic surgery
was again consulted and the patient was scheduled for mitral
valve replacement.  On [**7-19**], the patient was brought
to the operating room.  (please see operating report for full
details).  In summary, the patient had mitral valve
replacement with a #29 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve.  The
patient tolerated the operation well.  Following surgery, the
patient was transferred from the operating room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient did well in
the immediate postoperative period.  Following arrival in the
Intensive Care Unit, anesthesia was reversed and she was
weaned from the ventilator and ultimately successfully
extubated.  On postoperative day #1, she was weaned from all
cardio-active drugs.  The chest tubes were removed.  On
postoperative day #2, she was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiothoracic
rehabilitation.  Once on the floor, the patient's activity
level was increased with the assistance of the nursing staff
and the Department of Physical Therapy.  She was begun on
Coumadin.

On postoperative day #4, it was felt that the patient was
stable and ready to be transferred to the Rehabilitation
Floor for continuing recovery from her surgery.  At the time
of transfer, the patient's physical examination was as
follows;  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, heart rate 92,
blood pressure 127/75, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation
92% on room air.  Weight, preoperatively was 41.5 kg and on
discharge the weight was 46.2 kg.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 11, hematocrit 29, platelet count 197,000, PT
12.8, INR 1.1, sodium 133, potassium 4.3, chloride 98, CO2
25, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, glucose 91.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the patient to be
alert and oriented times three, moves all extremities,
follows commands, conversant.  RESPIRATORY:  Breath sounds
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
atrial fib, S1, S2, with click.  Sternum is
stable.  Incision with Steri Strips, open to air, clean, and
dry.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds.

cyanosis or edema.

2.  Ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
4.  Furosemide 20 mg b.i.d. times two weeks.
5.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. times two weeks.
6.  Synthroid 88 mcg q.d.
7.  Warfarin 2 mg q.h.s. goal INR is 2.5 to 3.  Of note:
Warfarin dose at home prior to surgery was 1 mg and she was
admitted to the hospital with INR of 3.3.
8.  Tylenol 650 mg q.6h.p.r.n.
