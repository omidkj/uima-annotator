MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2158-2-17**] BAL: no bacterial growth, no [**Month/Day/Year 14616**], no PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] AFB,
no CMV
**All blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative**
.
IMAGING:
[**2158-2-13**] CT SINUS: Bilateral sphenoid sinus, frontal sinuses, and
ethmoidal air cell mucosal thickening. Bilateral mucus-retention
cysts or polyps in the maxillary sinuses.
.
[**2158-2-13**] CT CHEST: Progression of bibasilar consolidations and
pleural effusions concerning for progression of pneumonia.
Opacities previously noted in the right middle lobe, however,
have resolved. Cardiomegaly, but no evidence for CHF. Increased
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive in the setting of a
progressive pneumonia. Distended gallbladder.
.
[**2158-2-13**] RENAL TXP US: No hydronephrosis. Resistive indices
ranging from 0.63 to 0.73, slightly increased as compared to the
previous study. Patent main renal artery and renal vein.
.
[**2158-2-20**] CT HEAD: Left middle cerebral artery distribution
infarction without evidence of mass effect or hemorrhage.
.
[**2158-2-21**] TTE: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. LV
systolic function appears depressed. The apex is akinetic. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (Definity
contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] used). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2158-2-22**] CAROTID US: No evidence of stenosis on the right. The
left system was not visualized due to presence of a central
line.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 M w/ ESRD [**1-18**] Wegener's granulomatosis s/p kidney transplant
[**4-/2154**] on tacro/cellcept, severe CAD s/p five-vessel CABG w/
