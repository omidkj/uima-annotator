History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 88691**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with hx of recurrent UTIs, CHF
with EF 50% who presented from NH with tachypnea following one
day of n/d/abd pain/chills.  Per nursing home report EMS was
called for hypertension however on arrival the patient was found
to be tachypnic and in respiratory distress.  Per patient and
daughter, the pt was in [**Hospital3 **] last weekend and doing well.
Over the last couple of days, she had poor PO intake,
generalized weakness, crampy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] abd pain and one
episode of non-bloody, non-tarry diarrhea this morning.  She
also had one episode of vomiting in the ED.  She denies any
worsening SOB, CP, cough.  Denies any recent aspiration events.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were: 97.7 75 138/95 96%
RA.  Pt was tachypnic, denied CP, tightness.  Exam was notable
for RRR, tachypneic to ~32 but CTAB, mild epigastric tenderness,
soft, non-distended no c/c/e.  EKG was v-paced, CXR showed mild
to moderate pulm edema.  Bipap was started with clinical
improvement in her tachypnea.  Blood gas was 7.27/32/206.  Urine
was notable for +leuks, nitrites, blood, WBCs, bacteria.  Labs
were notable for creatinine of 2.2, Lactate of 3.8, WBC of 12.9,
INR of 1.8.  She was given vanc, levofloxacin and anti-emetics
as well as 1 L NS. Blood and urine cxs were sent.  EKG showed
paced rhythm.  Vitals on transfer were 64, BP 155/75, RR 24, 97%
on FiO2 100%, BiPAP.
.
ROS:

Blood Cx [**2106-7-9**]: pending


STUDIES:
CXR [**2106-7-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with small
bilateral pleural
effusions.

CXR [**2106-7-10**]:
CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

A left IJ central line is present, tip over proximal/mid SVC. No
pneumothorax is detected. A dual-lead pacemaker is present, with
lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle.

There is cardiomegaly with a tortuous calcified aorta. The right
hilum and ? left hilum is prominent. There is upper zone
redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring suggesting CHF.
There is increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the
left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse
and/or consolidation. There is a small left and probable small
right effusion.

Compared with earlier the same day, and allowing for differences
in patient positioning, I doubt significant interval change.

TTE [**2106-7-10**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical dyskinesis and
near akinesis of the remaining ventricle. The basal inferior and
inferolateral walls contract best (LVEF <20%).. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical
half of the free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.

RUQ U/S [**2106-7-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation
without an
obstructing mass or stone seen. These findings might represent
ampullary
stenosis or post-cholecystectomy change. If clinically
indicated, MRCP might provide a different perspective on this,
and definitively rule out an obstructive mass.

CT HEAD W/O [**2106-7-11**]: READ PENDING

EEG:
1. No hemorrhage, CT evidence of infarct, or other acute
process.

2. Global atrophy, with extensive periventricular and
subcortical white
matter hypodensity, likely sequelae of chronic small vessel
ischemic disease.
