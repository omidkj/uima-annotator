HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old man with a
history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who presents with
five days of shortness of breath.  He developed the shortness
of breath in the setting of cough, lethargy and subjective
fevers.  He presents to the Emergency Room where he was found
to be significant dyspneic.  Physical examination revealed
evidence of pulmonary edema and a chest x-ray showed
bilateral infiltrates.  His oxygen saturation was 86% on room
air.  His ABG was 7.54, 48, 27.  He was given supplemental
oxygen and 60 mg of IV Lasix with a good response and his
oxygen saturation increased to 90% on three liters.  He was
admitted to the cardiac floor with a diagnosis of a CHF
exacerbation.

About one hour after arriving on the floor, about five hours
after presentation, he was found to be acutely hypoxic with
an oxygen saturation in the low 80's despite being on 100%
non rebreather.  EKG showed possible inferior ST elevations
in the setting of a paced left bundle branch block.  He
continued to be hypoxic despite an additional 200 mg IV of
Lasix, Heparin and a Nitro drip.  For this reason he was
emergently intubated and transferred to the CCU.

On arrival to the CCU he was noted to have a temperature of
103.5.  His heart rate was increased and his blood pressure
was low.  His urine output dropped off.  He was started on
Dopamine and his Nitro drip was stopped.  He was also started
on Vanco, Levo and Flagyl.  As he defervesced, his vital
signs stabilized and he began to have normal urine output
again.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Works as a private investigator.  Is
separated from his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] a 55 pack year history of
smoking and quit in [**2155**].  Uses alcohol socially.  Has no
history of drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a 65-year-old man who was
intubated and sedated with a blood pressure of 93/42 on 5 of
Dopamine.  Heart rate is 60 and he is satting 100% on 100%
FIO2.  His HEENT exam is unremarkable.  His neck is supple
with bounding carotid pulses.  His chest is clear
anterolaterally.  His heart is regular with no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  His abdomen is benign.  His extremities are
without edema with 2+ distal pulses.  His neuro exam is non
focal.

LABORATORY DATA:  He has a white count of 18.8, hematocrit
26.6 and platelet count 286,000.  His dip shows 96% polys, 2%
lymphs and 2% monos.  His Chem 7 is remarkable for a sodium
of 130 and a creatinine of 2.2, up from his baseline of 2.0.
His INR is 3.6 on Coumadin.  His fibrinogen is 519 and
d-dimer is less than 500.  His reticulocyte count is 1.6.
His EKG showed a paced left bundle branch block with a rate
of about 70.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1549**] was admitted to the coronary
care unit and started on antibiotics for presumed pneumonia
given his presentation with cough and fever.  He was
intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress.  He was
maintained on pressors for his hypotension.  He was continued
on the Levofloxacin of his antibiotics an defervesced after
about 24 hours.  He was diuresed about 3 liters and his
pressors were able to be weaned off.  He was successfully
extubated two days after intubation.  The next day his
Captopril was restarted at 6.25 mg.  He tolerated his first
dose.  With his second dose, his blood pressure dropped into
the 70's/30's.  He was started on Dopamine and Levophed.  At
this point he spiked a fever.  Fluid boluses were given to
try to augment his pressure.  However, he again began to
suffer from hypoxic respiratory arrest with a gas of 7.4, 32
and 47.  A PA catheter was placed to better assess his
hemodynamics.  His CVP was 8, wedge pressure was 35, cardiac
index was 2.0.  At this point Dobutamine was started in
addition to the Dopamine and Levophed.  He was reintubated.
His PA pressures were in the 70's/40's.  His systolic blood
pressure was in the 70's and diastolic blood pressure was in
the 50's.  He received Lasix and Morphine overnight.  He
spiked again the following day.  He was diuresed down to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1554**] in the low 20's and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 17.  On the Dobutamine he was able to be weaned.  He had
cardiac index of 2.1 to 2.2 and was able to be weaned off of
pressors.  Vancomycin was started with concern for either
nosocomial pneumonia or line infection.  On the Vancomycin,
he defervesced.

LFTs were checked to see if there was any hidden source of
infection that we might be missing.  His LFTs, amylase and
lipase were increased and abdominal CT was obtained which
showed no signs of pancreatic inflammation or liver or
gallbladder pathology.

After his pressors were weaned off, he was also weaned off
the Dobutamine.  His Swan was removed and he was successfully
extubated again five days after his second intubation.  He
did well initially but was approximately 1?????? liters positive
by the next morning and had an episode where he desatted with
an increase in his respiratory rate.  He did not respond to a
60 mg shot of IV Lasix and his sats continued to drop into
the 80's.  He was reintubated a third time.  At this point
his blood pressure once again dropped and he was restarted on
Dopamine.  After this he spiked again.  Over the next three
days he was continued to be diuresed and he was kept on
minimal sedation to try to avoid any medicine that would
lower his blood pressure.  Frequent family meetings were held
during his course.  Decision was made to have one last try
with Milrinone to try to improve his cardiac index.  On
Milrinone he was able to be weaned off of pressors and he had
good Swan parameters as the Swan was refloated after his
third intubation.  However, multiple attempts to wean him off
the ventilator failed.

The team addressed the possibility of trach placement in a
long-term wean with the family.  The family stated that he
would not have wanted that kind of quality of life and so the
decision was made to withdraw ventilatory support.  He passed
away peacefully with his family at his side on [**2161-1-10**] at
3:05 p.m.
