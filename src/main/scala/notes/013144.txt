Date of Birth:   [**2102-5-28**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior-posterior myocardial infarction
status post unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal
angiography.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old woman with
no known coronary artery disease who was in her usual state
of health until the Saturday night prior to admission when
she started to experience chest pain.  The pain was sharp
located substernal and left chest region radiating to the
back to the right chest and to the left arm.  She also had
some diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting, but no shortness of
breath.  She thought her symptoms were due to flu-like
symptoms.  She had persistent symptoms, but did not seek any
medical advice.

She presented to the [**Hospital3 2063**] Emergency Room on
Monday (two days after her initial presentation) as a walk-in
patient.  She complained of [**6-19**] chest pain.  Her initial
electrocardiogram showed Q waves, ST elevation, and T-wave
inversions in leads II, III, and aVF.  She was treated with
aspirin, Morphine, and nitroglycerin.  Her chest pain
subsided to [**1-20**].  She remained hemodynamically stable in the
Emergency Room.  She was later transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for percutaneous transluminal
angiography.  However, the percutaneous transluminal
angiography was unsuccessful due to the difficulty of her
achieving greater than TIMI flow.  The patient also
experienced some transient bradycardia intraoperatively, and
required a temporary pacer placement.  She was transferred to
CCU in stable condition for further medical management.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post cholecystectomy [**94**] years
ago, status post five normal vaginal deliveries, regular
annual examinations.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smoker, quit six months ago, 22, 30-pack
year history.  Occasional alcohol.  No other drug abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Heart disease.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.5, blood pressure
is 127/77, heart rate 99, and O2 sat is 96% on room air.
General:  Looks comfortable in bed in no acute distress.
Head and neck examination:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1, S2, faint
heart sounds.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally
anteriorly.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.
Extremities:  No edema.  Neurologic is nonfocal.

LABORATORIES AT [**Hospital3 **]:  White count 17.3.
Differential is 88% neutrophils, 8% lymphocytes, 2%
monocytes.  Hematocrit is 40.9, platelets 243.  Chem-7 within
normal limits.  CK MB is 102.  Troponin is 54.

Electrocardiogram showed Q waves in leads III and aVF.  ST
elevation in II, III, and aVF.  T-wave inversions in II, III,
and aVF.  ST depression [**Hospital3 **].  ST depression V2 and poor
R-wave progression.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION AT [**Hospital1 **]:  Complete blood count is 20.4, hematocrit is 35.7,
platelets 190.  PT is 13.5, PTT is 39.8, INR is 1.3.  Chem-7
within normal limits with BUN and creatinine of 20/0.6.  CK
is 2048.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM I:  Second degree A-V block, Q waves in III
and aVF, V1, ST elevation and T-wave inversions in leads II,
III, and aVF.  ST depression in V1 to V3.  Right sided
electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, Q waves in III,
aVF, V2 to V3, ST elevation, T-wave inversions in leads II,
III, and aVF, ST depression in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevation in V4-V6.

CATHETERIZATION:  Two vessel disease.  Mid right coronary
artery 100% occlusion, proximal left anterior descending
artery 60%, mid left anterior descending artery 50%, diagonal
I 80%, diagonal II 30%, acute inferior myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was essentially
uncomplicated.  She had episodes of chest discomfort
initially which had no associated electrocardiogram changes
and unrelieved with sublingual nitroglycerin and Morphine.
Her CK peaked at 2048 on admission, and continued to trend
down to 147 on discharge.

She had an echocardiogram done on hospital day two, which
showed ejection fraction of 30% with inferior-posterior
infarction.  A temporary pacer wire was pulled on hospital
day three, and she had no significant events on Telemetry.
She had episodes of hyponatremia which serum sodium down to
128 secondary to congestive heart failure, which was
successfully managed with aggressive diuresis.  On discharge,
her serum sodium went back to 136.  Her urine culture went
back positive for E. coli.  She was also treated for a
seven-day course of Bactrim for uncomplicated urinary tract
infection.

Patient's hip culture also came back positive for
Corynebacterium, but it was very likely contaminant, so the
decision was not to treat, but to draw a set of blood
cultures, given the patient was doing well clinically without
fever and increasing white blood cell count.  She also
developed guaiac-positive stools while inhouse with
hematocrits slowly changing down from 36 to 30.  Hematocrit
was stabilized around 30 with Protonix tid.  Decision was
made to have outpatient [**Hospital 2792**] and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy workup.

She tolerated medical management with aspirin, beta blocker,
ACE inhibitor, statin, and diuretics very well.  The patient
was evaluated by physical therapist before discharge and
deemed stable enough to go home without further physical
therapy.

She will be followed by her primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4610**]
and her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute inferior-posterior myocardial
infarction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 mg po q day, aspirin 325 q
day, atenolol 25 mg q day, lisinopril 10 mg q day, sublingual
