CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year-old
female with a history of right lower lobe lung nodule likely
metastatic breast cancer presented with shortness of breath,
worsening hyponatremia, hyperkalemia to the Emergency Room.
The patient was recently admitted on [**2147-3-1**] for syncope and
found to have hyponatremia of unknown etiology with decreased
urine sodium and euvolemia.  At that time her Lasix was
discontinued and her [**Last Name (un) **] was decreased and the patient's
hyponatremia improved.  The patient was found to have
exudative pleural effusion positive for adenocarcinoma with
ER positivity.  The patient was to follow up with oncology,
however, did not make her appointments.  She was seen by her
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2147-8-25**] and at that time was found
to have a sodium of 126 and a potassium of 5.5.  At that time
her [**Last Name (un) **] was discontinued and Hydralazine was started.  The
patient's laboratories subsequently revealed a sodium of 125
and a K of 6.0.  The patient was asked by her primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2147-8-30**] to come to the Emergency Room, but did
not present until [**2147-8-31**]. In the Emergency Department the
patient was complaining of shortness of breath.  Her chest
x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion right greater then
left.  A CTA was negative for pulmonary embolus.  The patient
was treated with Ativan and experienced respiratory
depression with an arterial blood gas revealing 7.22, 63, 81.
The patient was brought to the MICU and was intubated.  The
patient was extubated approximately eight hours later and her
workup for hyponatremia was initiated.  The patient's TSH was
checked, a cord stem test was performed and urine lytes were
also sent off.  The patient was also seen by psychiatry and
was felt not to be currently unstable, but to have
depression.  The patient was transferred to the Medicine
Service on [**2147-9-3**] for further medical management of her
metastatic breast cancer, pleural effusions as well as
electrolyte abnormalities.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On the date of transfer the patient's
temperature maximum was 98 degrees, T current was 96.5, pulse
90 to 115.  Blood pressure 144/70 and oxygen saturation was
97 to 98% on 2 liters of oxygen.  Generally, the patient was
in no acute distress, was teary eyed and appeared depressed.
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements intact.
Mucous membranes are moist.  Oropharynx was clear.
Additionally, no thyromegaly was palpated.  There was no neck
lymphadenopathy.  Neck was supple.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm.  There was no JVD.  The JVP was approximately 6
cm.  On lung examination the patient had decreased breath
sounds at the bases bilaterally, right greater then left and
crackles bilaterally right greater then left.  There was no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema in her extremities.  Her belly
was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel
sounds.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right lower lobe lung nodule malignant pleural effusion.
2.  Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
3.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction less then
20% on [**6-29**].  [**10-28**] had catheterization with no coronary
artery disease found.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
6.  Breast cancer status post mastectomy in [**2138**], status post
Tamoxifen treatment.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  Multinodular goiter.

ALLERGIES:  Vasotec, which cause a cough.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prozac 10 mg one po q day.
2.  Digoxin 125 mg one q.d.
3.  FES04 325 t.i.d.
4.  NPH 25 in the morning and 8 at night.
5.  Levoxyl 100 mcg q day.
6.  Nasacort 55 b.i.d.
7.  Coumadin 5/3.75 on alternating days.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with daughter.  Forty pack
year history of smoking.  No tobacco currently.  Quit twenty
years ago.  No ETOH.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 8.9, hematocrit
33.1, platelets count 207, INR 1.2, sodium 133, potassium
5.1, chloride 99, bicarb 24, BUN 30, creatinine 1.3.  The
patient has a history of renal insufficiency and glucose 129.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory failure:  The patient
remained on minimal oxygen requiring initially sating at 99
to 100% on 1 to 2 liters.  Subsequently hematology/oncology
was contact[**Name (NI) **] as well as interventional pulmonology and it
was felt that the patient was not currently a candidate for
chemotherapy and that hormonal therapy with Arimidex was
indicated.  Hence, the patient had a talc pleurodesis on the
right side with chest tube placement.  The plan is to pull the
tube when drainage is < 150cc/24 hours. The patient's pain was
very well controlled with minimal pain medication requirement.

2.  Metastatic breast cancer:  The patient was discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] and it was felt that the
patient's functional capacity was quite bad and that she was
not an ideal candidate for chemotherapy and it was decided
that the patient would continue on Arimidex therapy at 1 mg q
day and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] upon discharge.

3.  Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia:  The patient's urine
electrolytes were recent and a TTEKG was calculated.  This
was consistent with type 4RTA felt likely secondary to [**Last Name (un) **]
use.  In the hospital no [**Last Name (un) **] was used and the patient's
hyponatremia and hyperkalemia completely normalized with
entirely normal sodiums and potassiums by the time of
discharge.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on regular sliding
scale of insulin and had very good glycemic control with
blood sugars ranging from 98 to approximately 130.  Otherwise
the patient was continued on her Synthroid and her q.i.d.
finger sticks.

5.  Hematology:  The patient's Coumadin was restarted at the
time of discharge.  Her INR will need to be followed up and
the patient will need to stay in the range of approximately
2.5 to 3.

6.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was maintained on an H2 blocker
and subq heparin with no complications.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation center for further physical therapy as well as
pulmonary therapy as the patient is considerably
deconditioned.  The patient is to follow up as an outpatient
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for her primary care
and further oncology workup.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Digoxin 125 po q day.
2.  FES04 325 mg po t.i.d.
3.  NPH 25 in the morning and 8 at night.
4.  Levoxyl 100 mcg one po q day.
5.  Lipitor 20 mg one po q day.
6.  Coumadin 5 mg on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday
and 3.75 on Monday and Wednesday.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable at the time of this dictation.
