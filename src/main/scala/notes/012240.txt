History of Present Illness:
56-year-old female with a history of chronic abdominal pain,
laxative abuse, and chronic diarrhea who complained of shorness
of breath.  Had been admitted for worsening abdominal
pain/distension, chills and diarrhea.  CT demonstrate illeus vs.
low grade SBO.  Had been stable on floor.
.
Upon evaluation of patient by floor team she had a RR in the
30's but oxygenating well on 4L NC.  Patient complained of
worsening abdominal pain, shortness of breath.  BP 82/42 but
decreased to the 70's (baseline BP's in the 80's to 90's).  P
110, afebrile.  ABG 7.25/27/105/12 on 4L NC (baseline pCO2
50's-60's).

Patient with only 22g PIV x 1.  Saline started and brought to
unit.  Line placed with difficulty.  Sterilly prepped for R SC
or R IJ.  Unable to locate R subclav after mult sticks (4) and
accessed R SC artery.  Then converted to R IJ and accessed with
US.  Line placement sterile but may be compromised.  Patient
complaining of abdominal pain.  NGT placed to suction with
feculent material.

Pertinent Results:
Admission labs:

[**2134-3-1**] CT Abd:
1.  Although the patient's colon has always appeared dilated and
fluid-filled, the distal loops of small bowel on today's study
appear more prominent, and are fluid filled, which does raise
the possibility of new ileus or a distal colonic stricture given
decompression of the distal sigmoid/rectum. The proximal loops
of small bowel are not as dilated, and this is likely due to the
decompression from the nasogastric tube, which is in place.  A
follow up CT study (non-contrast would be sufficient) could be
performed to see if the narrowed area of the sigmoid colon re-
expands.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated
atelectasis.
3.  Bilateral renal cysts.
4.  Prominence of the intrahepatic biliary ducts is stable.
.
[**2134-3-3**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
hypokinesis of the basal to mid septum. Hypokinesis is also
suggested in the basal inferior and infero-lateral wall. The
distal segments appear hyperdynamiic with an overall preserved
LVEF (50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal image quality. Basal LV hypokinesis most prominent in
the basal septum. These findings may be consistent with a
non-vascular pattern of LV dysfunction but due to limited image
quality, CAD cannot be excluded.
.
[**2134-3-6**] CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1.  No PE.
2.  Worsening moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  Enlarging
bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  More consolidative opacity could represent asymmetric
pulmonary edema or atelectasis; however, a superimposed
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
4.  Enlarged new right middle lobe nodule.  Given the rate at
which it has increased in size, an inflammatory process is
favored.  However, attention to this on followup exams is
recommended.
5.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
6.  Severe emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56 yo woman with a h/o chronic abdominal pain,
laxative abuse, and chronic diarrhea who was admitted to ICU for
SOB, hypotension, acidemia.
.
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The pt. received aggressive IV
fluid for presumed hypovolemic hypotension. She developed
pulmonary edema presumably from IVF and a component of Left
heart failure.  She was intubated on [**3-3**] for tachypnea and
hypoxia. We diuresed her and her respiratory status improved.
She was extubated on [**3-5**] and did reasonably well on a facemask,
however, later that night she again became hypoxic, tachypnic,
and began to tire and was reextubated. Her fluid status was
significantly positive, so she was started on a lasix gtt. She
was eventually transitioned to pressure, support. Her pulmonary
edema improved and she was extubated on [**3-13**] and did well
thereafter.
.
2. Cardiovascular: The pt. was initially hypotensive. Cardiac
enzymes revealed a troponin leak (0.15) which trending down. An
echo on [**3-3**] showed hypokinesis of the
basal/inferior/inferiolateral wall with an EF of 50%. This was
likely secondary to demand ischemia or an NSTEMI in the setting
of her hypotension. She was started on aspirin 81mg daily.
.
3. Hypotension: The etiology of her hypotension was likely
multifactorial (metabolic, infectious, cardiogenic). On arrival
to the ICU she was given approximately 5L of IVF and started on
levophed and also required vasopressin during her stay. She was
slowly weaned of the va
