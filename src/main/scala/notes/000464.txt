General - elderly appearing man in mild respiratory distress.
HEENT - clear oropharynx, moist mucous membranes.  Neck - no

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White count 10, hematocrit 34.8,

44, BUN 18, creatinine 0.6, glucose 201.  ABG on 6 liters pH
7.23, pCO2 114, pO2 123.  Chest x-ray shows mild CHF.  EKG
normal sinus rhythm at 120 beats per minute, no apparent
ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was initially admitted
to the medical intensive care unit for Bi-PAP.  The patient
initially refused Bi-PAP on the following morning, house
officer was notified that the patient was somnolent and
nonresponsive.  The patient was subsequently intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient was started on
azithromycin and prednisone 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.  The patient
was diuresed with Lasix and had one liter of fluid out on day
one.  The next day the patient extubated himself and his
repeat ABG was pH 7.45, pCO2 58, pO2 62 on three liters nasal
cannula.  The patient showed no signs of respiratory distress
and was subsequently transferred to one of the general
medical teams.  The patient continued having respiratory
status at baseline.  His prednisone was continued at 60 mg
p.o. b.i.d.  The patient received nebulized treatments as
well as his regular inhalers and finished a three day course
of azithromycin.  His respiratory function appeared to be at
baseline.  The patient reported shortness of breath only with
exertion.  The patient was subsequently discharged with a
prednisone taper and close outpatient follow up.

2.  Diastolic dysfunction, likely secondary to a combination
of COPD and obstructive sleep apnea.  A trial of CPAP was
offered to the patient, however, the patient refused and it
is recommended that the patient have an outpatient sleep
study due to likely diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.

3.  Diabetes.  The patient's finger stick blood sugars were
somewhat elevated in the range of 200 to 300 secondary to
prednisone.  The patient was continued on his regular dose of
Metformin and was covered with regular insulin sliding scale.

4.  Neurologically the patient was put on CIWA protocol, but
has not required any Valium and did not show any signs of
alcohol withdraw.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  COPD with acute exacerbation, status post intubation for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2.  Type 2 diabetes.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Obesity.
5.  Smoking.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone taper, the patient is to
take 60 mg of prednisone q.d. for one more day followed by 40
mg of prednisone q.d. x3 days, 30 mg q.d. x3 days, 20 mg q.d.
x3 days, 1 mg q.d. x3 days and then stop.  No other changes
