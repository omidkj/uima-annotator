Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 56072**] was admitted on [**2114-11-14**] with increased shortness of
breath and cough and underwent a flex bronchoscopy which
revealed recurrent severe distal tracheobronchomalacia.
Pulmonary was consulted and recommenced increasing her Nexium to
40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Flovent and Serevent.  GI was consulted and
recommended aggressive reflux management.  On HD #2 her cough
and wheezes persisted and she was started on pulse steroids.
ENT was consulted to assess her vocal cords which was normal.
Her symptoms improved slightly and underwent a rigid
bronchoscopy and silicone stent placement on HD #6.  Her
respiratory status continued to improved and the stent was
removed on HD#8.  On HD #9 ([**2114-11-23**]) she underwent successful
Redo right thoracotomy, Removal of previous bronchoplasty Marlex
mesh, Suture bronchoplasty of the right bronchus intermedius,
coverage with a pleural flap buttress, flexible bronchoscopy and
right lower lobe wedge resection. Post-operative pain was
controlled with an epidural catheter which was later switched to
a PCA. Two chest tubes were placed intraoperatively. Pt was
extubated [**11-23**] and remained in the ICU post-operatively and was
oxygenating well with a face mask. Pt was advanced to a regular
diet on [**11-25**], was transferred out of the ICU to a regular floor
bed, the chest tube was removed and the chest [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was
placed to bulb suction. During the night of [**11-22**] pt had a
decreased respiratory rate and oxygenation due to over
narcotization and was given Narcan, supplemental O2, and a
nebulizer with good effect. On [**11-26**] the pt underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy which showed normal clearing airways. Pt was
switched to oral pain medication on [**11-27**], supplemental oxygen
was weaned, [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed, and central venous line was
removed. peri-operative Levofloxacin and Vancomycin were
completed on [**11-30**]. Pt was discharged on [**12-1**] tolerating a
