RADIOLOGY  Final Report

HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) BILAT  [**2167-1-8**] 3:49 PM

IMPRESSION:

2. Chondrocalcinosis. Severe joint space narrowing of the ST-T
joints bilaterally.

Imaging:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2167-1-3**] 8:55 PM

FINDINGS: There is normal opacification of the pulmonary
arterial vasculature without evidence of filling defects to
suggest the presence of pulmonary embolism. There is dilatation
of the main and left pulmonary artery, measuring 4.4 and 4.7 cm,
respectively, suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension. The right pulmonary artery is borderline in
diameter measuring 3.0 cm. There is backflow of contrast into
the liver veins and coronary sinus, inicating right heart
failure. There are multiple prominent mediastinal lymph nodes,
the largest one located in the lower paratracheal lesion
measuring 13 mm in short axis diameter (4, 31). Other lymph
nodes in the upper paratracheal, prevascular and subcarinal
regions do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There are coronary artery calcifications involving circumflex
and LAD and scattered calcifications in the aortic root, aortic
arch and origin of great vessels. There are small bilateral
pleural effusions and bilateral dependent opacities, but given
the early acquisition in the arterial phase it cannot be
definitely determined if these represent atelectasis or
pneumonia consolidations. There is moderate cardiomegaly.

Images through the upper abdomen do not demonstrate acute
pathological findings. There are atherosclerotic calcifications
of the descending aorta.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of clinically significant PE.
2. Marked dilatation of pulmonary arteries, consistent with
underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Bilateral lower lobe opacities and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy; given the patient's history, this may be
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
4. Very small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Moderate cardiomegaly
6. Coronary artery calcifications of LAD and circumflex.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-1-3**] 5:46 PM

INDICATION: Altered mental status.

CT CERVICAL SPINE: Degenerative changes are seen, with
straightening of the normal lordosis of the spine, which can be
compatible with degenerative change. Loss of disc space is seen
at all levels; there is no malalignment. Anterior osteophytes
are seen at C5-6, C6-7, C7-T1, and small posterior osteophyte at
C5-6. Old healed fracture of the posterior process of the T1
vertebral body. The patient is intubated. A nasogastric tube is
in place. Interstitial prominence in both lungs and fluid along
the left major fissure is seen, which may represent fluid
overload. A right internal jugular vein line is seen in a
capacious right internal jugular vein. A small amount of
dependent material surrounding the endotracheal tube in the
posterior aspect is likely secretions.

IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes of the spine, without fracture
or malalignment.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-1-3**] 5:45 PM

INDICATION: Altered mental status.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No priors for comparison. No
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial
infarct is identified. Hypodensities are seen scattered in both
corona radiata and centrum semiovale, indicating chronic
microvascular change. Cavernous carotid arteries are calcified.
Scattered opacification of ethmoid air cells is seen. The
patient is
