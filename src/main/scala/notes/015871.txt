HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old
woman who, in [**2133-10-26**], around the 14th, sustained a
trauma when she became trapped between the counter-weight of
a backhoe and a concrete wall.  She had a crushing injury
between her left and right abdomen.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital 6930**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital at that time, and during her
work-up there was no evidence of any internal injury.  She
was stable, observed and sent home.  Approximately one week
after being sent home, she became increasingly dyspneic, and
was brought to [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital on [**2133-11-15**].  She was ill
and on work-up she was found to have free air in the abdomen.
She was taken to the Operating Room where she was found to
have a perforation of the distal ileum and intestinal
contents filling her abdomen.  A side-to-side functional
end-to-end anastomosis was made after resection of the
perforation three feet from the ileocecal valve.  G- and
J-tubes were placed intraoperatively, and she had tolerated
that procedure well.

One week after that procedure, it was noted that a bilious
nature was draining from her wound and she was taken back to
the Operating Room for re-exploration and found that the
sites of the G- and J-tubes were leaking intestinal contents
into the abdomen.  The tubes were changed and she tolerated
that procedure well.  Afterwards, she continued to leak and
she was brought back to the Operating Room for a third time
on [**12-12**]/200.  The G-tube site was closed with a TX-60 mm
stapler and oversewn with #3-0 Silk sutures.  The J-tube site
was oversewn with #3-0 Prolene sutures.

After the third procedure, she continued to appear to be
leaking from her wound and continued to have what was now
characterized as a small enterocutaneous fistula.  During her
time at this hospital, she was placed on TPN, continued NPO
and had a nasogastric tube.  They had placed a VAC dressings
in the wound containing the fistula, which was draining
approximately one liter a day.  She had undergone a
tracheostomy tube placement on [**12-12**].  On [**2133-11-26**],
she had undergone a catheter insertion for starting TPN.
During this procedure, it was noted that after the wire
insertion, the patient developed premature ventricular
contractions, subsequently turned to ventricular tachycardia
and then ventricular fibrillation arrest.  She was shocked
and underwent ACLS protocol.  She was recovered into sinus
rhythm after one shock.  The line was aborted at that time.
A line was then successfully placed afterwards.

She was then being transferred on [**2133-12-29**], to [**Hospital1 346**] under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**]
of her enterocutaneous fistula.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count of
9.1, hematocrit of 30.4, platelets of 512, PT of 13.0, PTT of
27.8, INR of 1.2.  Sodium of 140, potassium of 4.3, chloride
of 102, bicarbonate of 32, BUN of 14, creatinine of 0.4,
glucose of 111.  ALT of 34, AST of 26, alkaline phosphatase
is 113, total bilirubin is 0.5.

Urinalysis was negative.

Her gas on admission was pH of 7.45, pO2 of 104, pCO2 of 45,
bicarbonate of 34.

X-ray on admission showed a left lower lobe consolidation.

EKG on admission showed sinus tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Blue
Surgery Service on [**2133-12-29**].  At that time, she had had a
VAC dressing applied to her fistula.  This was removed.
Multiple daily dressing changes were continued.  Wet-to-dry
were placed in the open areas and Duoderm were placed to
prevent skin breakdown.  She was continued on TPN.  A feeding
tube was placed into the fistula and tube feeds were started
at that time.  On [**1-7**], the patient spiked a temperature.
Blood cultures were sent which were positive for
Staphylococcus coagulase negative species.  At that time, it
was decided that a central line which was placed at [**Location (un) 1514**]
was to be changed and resited.  The catheter tip was sent for
culture and came back as Staphylococcus coagulase negative.

She underwent a line change on [**2134-1-8**].  During the line
placement, the patient became acutely short of breath.  Her
right chest was needle decompressed for a tension
pneumothorax.  She then subsequently went into cardiac
arrest.  CPR was initiated and she was shocked with 200
joules times one.  The ACLS protocol was continued for
approximately five minutes.  A right chest tube was placed
during this time as well.  She was transferred to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further care, on full
pressor support, ventilation via the tracheostomy and for
close monitoring.

Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, she also was
witnessed to have a post-arrest seizure.  Neurology was
consulted and she was started on Dilantin.  She was also
unresponsive after the Code and three days later she was
mentating at baseline.

On [**2134-1-12**], after stabilizing and after being weaned off
of pressors and her ventilatory support, with patient
mentating well, she was transferred back to the Floor.  On
[**2134-1-18**], the patient described sudden acute onset of
shortness of breath.  O2 saturations dropped down to 40%.
She was placed on 100% tracheostomy mask.  She underwent a
CTA which demonstrated massive bilateral pulmonary emboli and
showed bilateral pleural effusions.  She also underwent an
echocardiogram; this showed severe global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis.  Ejection fraction of the left
ventricle remained greater than 75%.  She was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit.  She was placed on a ventilator for
respiratory support.  After the findings of the CTA she was
started on TPA and had received her first dose and bright red
blood was suctioned from the tracheostomy.  TPA was stopped.
She was continued on heparin.

During this period, she was continued on TPN.  She was
receiving tube feeds via the tube feed placed into the
fistula.  She was started on Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and
Diflucan after the initial cultures were drawn.  She did have
an additional positive blood culture on [**2134-1-30**].  She
remained in the unit on heparin, started on Coumadin and was
weaned off the ventilator appropriately.  Her antibiotics
were stopped on [**2134-1-31**].  She continued to receive
aggressive pulmonary toilet.  On [**2134-2-3**], her O2
saturations were decreased.  She was evaluated and an IVC
Filter was placed by Interventional Radiology for presumed
continued pulmonary emboli.  She tolerated that procedure
well.  She remained in the Intensive Care Unit for several
weeks, receiving TPN, undergoing a ventilator wean and
receiving appropriate tracheostomy care.  During this time,
she also received Physical Therapy and was ambulating.

On [**2134-2-17**], she underwent a fistulogram which significant
for two enterocutaneous fistulas with approximately four to
five feet of small bowel between them, with contrast flowing
distally with no sign of an obstruction.  On [**2134-2-23**], her
tracheostomy was discontinued and was tolerated
appropriately.  On [**2134-2-25**], a PICC line was placed for
continued TPN.  A this time, she also spiked a temperature.
Blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus.  Sputum was
sent an
