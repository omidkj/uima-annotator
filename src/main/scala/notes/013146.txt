Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-9-7**] bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 89yo male with PMH notable for COPD, Afib, DM,
h/o PNA requiring intubations, and h/o bronchomalacia transfered
to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated from [**Hospital3 4298**] Hosptial. Per report
pt was discharged yesterday from MVH for pneumonia. Today he had
dyspnea, called EMS and was taken to MVH ED where he was treated
for ?COPD and CHF exacerbations with azithromycin, solumedrol,
and lasix. Pt was placed on Bipap but did not improve and thus
was intubated. Per report, he had a neg D-dimer and a
leukocytosis of 19 (but on prednisone).

In the ED, initial BP was 110s/70s, but it soon dropped to
70s/50s. Pt had received 1.5L IVF prior to arrival. In the ED,
he was started on Levophed, which was quickly titrated off (BP
100s/60s). He received an additional 1L in ED. Ultrasound showed
compressible SVC.  He received Vanc/Cefepime in the ED.

Labs here notable for WBC 12.1, INR 3.2, Cr 1.3, and lactate
2.4. CXR showed bibasilar opacities. EKG showed fib or flutter
at 59. Unable to obtain additional history due to intubated pt.

Imaging:

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2101-9-4**]  6:24:14 PM
Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response rate of
59 beats per minute. Right bundle-branch block. Non-specific ST
segment changes in the inferolateral leads. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2101-9-5**] Cardiovascular ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. RV
with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-9-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  ET tube below the clavicles.  Recommend repeat film to
better assess
position.
2.  Bibasilar opacities which may be atelectasis; however,
infection cannot be
excluded.  Possible small left pleural effusion.


CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND Study Date of [**2101-9-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Severe tracheobronchomalacia with areas of complete collapse
of the
trachea as well as severe narrowing of the left and right main
stem bronchi.
2.  Complete obstruction of left lower lobe bronchus causing
collapse of the left lower lobe, which is most likely chronic.
Recommend bronchoscopy for further evaluation.
3.  Consolidation at the right lower lobe with bronchiectasis
which may be atelectasis vs. pneumonia or aspiration.
4.  Multiple nodules for which follow up with CT in 3 months is
recommended.  Nodule with halo of ground glass in the right
lower lobe may be infectious in nature.
5.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
6.  Large thyroid goiter arising from the left lobe of the
thyroid causing focal mild compression on the trachea.



Brief Hospital Course:
89yo M PMHx bronchomalacia, Afib, recent OSH admission for PNA,
who re-presented 1d after discharge w dyspnea and hypoxia
requiring intubation, bronch and CT c/w bronchomalacia, e/o
ongoing infection versus mucus plugging.

Active Issues
===========================
# Tracheobronchomalacia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital 31145**] for hypoxic respiratory failure. He was
recently d/c'd from OSH where he was treated for a ?candidal
pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. He was discharged on diflucan,
prednisone, and levofloxacin.  He then represented to OSH for
hypoxic respiratory failure and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after
intubation. Upon admission to MICU, he had CXR showed possible
bilateral pleural effusions, but pneumonia, especially in the
retrocardiac space cannot be ruled out. WBC is elevated but
unclear whether this is due to prednisone vs infectious process.
CHF is unlikely given preserved LV function. D dimer negative at
OSH. A bronchoscopy was performed which revealed airways that
were convoluted with sputum and mucous plugs.  The patient was
extubated on [**2101-9-6**] without complication.  A CT trachea was
performed which showed severe tracheobronchomalacia with
complete collapse of the trachea on expiration and severe
narrowing of the mainstem bronchi; secretions in airways with
complete obstruction of left lower lobe bronchus causing
collapse of the left lower lobe, likely choronic; consolidation
at right lower lobe which may be atelectasis, infectious or
aspiration; multiple sub-centimeter nodules for which follow up
in 3 months is required. On [**2101-9-7**], interventional pulmonology
unsuccesfully tried to place y stent. Thoracics was consulted
and did not believe that tracheobronchoplasty would help
alleviate patient's symptoms.  He was treated medically with
mucolytics, flutter valve, and nebulizers as well as cpap as
needed that helped improved his symptoms. Pulmonology was
consulted and PFTs during hospitalization did not illustrate
reactive airway pattern or reversibility with bronchodilators.
He was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia as outlined
below.
Upon discharge, his symptoms greatly improved, with O2
saturation high 90s on R
