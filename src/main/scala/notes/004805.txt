History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 yo woman with h/o DM2, ESRD, AFib on
coumadin, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis s/p liver and kidney
transplant in [**2153**], on cellcept/prograf, and prednisone taper
(for gout flare), who presents with a four-day history of fever
(tmax 101 at home), headache, neck pain, and confusion. She
reportedly presented to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital yesterday with similar
complaints and was found to have a WBC of 21. It was thought
that this was secondary to her steroids, so she was discharged
home. She then presented back to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital today with
similar complaints, but at this time she had meningismus. She
was given Ceftriaxone 1g and Vancomycin (at 3:25pm), and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient's initial VS were T 101.2, P 76, BP
126/60, R 18, O2 99% on 4L. She was unable to have a LP because
her INR was 2.7, and there was concern that her picture was more
consistent with an epidural abscess. Neurology was consulted,
who recommended LP after INR reversal. Neurosurgery was then
C/S, who recommended CT spine with contrast, as a MRI cannot be
performed because of her pacemaker. She was given another 1 g of
CTX, Ampicillin, Acyclovir, and Decadron 10 mg in the ED. Her
mental status began to decline and she was thus admitted to the
MICU for further evaluation. At the time of transfer, her VS
were 76, 147/59, 17, 96% on 2L.
.
On the floor, she continues to have [**8-17**] HA, described as sharp,
pounding, constant, and diffuse, as well as stiff neck. Denies
photophobia, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, rash. No recent
travel; last trip was to [**State 3908**] in [**Month (only) **] to visit her son.
[**Name (NI) **] known tick exposures.

Pertinent Reports
CT Spine with contrast ([**2155-3-4**]): No evidence of abscess on
noncontrast CT. Note that this study has low sensitivity for
infection. If the patient cannot undergo MR imaging, a contrast
CT may be the next best alternative, although far less useful
for detecting intraspinal infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old female with extensive medical history including DM,
ESRD, AFib on coumadin, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis s/p
liver and kidney transplant, on immunosuppression, who presented
with fever, headache, neck pain and altered mental status for
four days. She was initially admitted to the medical service for
management. Symptoms were concerning for meningitis versus
epidural abscess. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated which
included vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir along
with a 4 day course of dexamethasone to be completed which
completed on [**3-8**]. CT neck did not sho
