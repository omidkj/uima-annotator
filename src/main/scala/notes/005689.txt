Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Steatorrhea and abdominal pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pylorus-perserving Whipple and open cholecystectomy [**2145-2-25**]


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 81709**] if a delightful 47-year-old woman who has
suffered from abdominal discomfort and apparent steatorrhea and
has been imaged by endoscopic procedures and found to have a
pancreatic ductal abnormality and cellular atypia on brush
cytology. While no definitive mass was identified on CT
angiography, there is no evidence of metastatic disease and
nothing to suggest unresectable carcinoma of the pancreatic
head. Nevertheless, on the basis of a suspected but unproven
malignancy, definitive resection was recommended to the patient,
especially in light of the cellular atypia. More worrisome is
that the pancreatic duct itself was dilated out proximal to
this body and tail of the pancreas. She had no antecedent
history of biliary obstruction.

Seasonal Allergies

[**2145-3-8**] Torso CT W/ contrast:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, with
a possible concomitant focus of LLL infectious consolidation.
Overall significant improvement in pulmonary parenchymal
aeration with mild residual ground-glass reticular opacities.
2. Adrenal Indistinctness and fat stranding, raising the
possibility of
adrenalitis/hemorrhage. Clinical correlation is recommended.
3. Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy,slightly improved. Could
reflect reactive changes. Document resolution after treatment.
4. Focal area of low attenuation in the left hepatic lobe (2:62)
measuring
1.1 x 1.6 cm with peripheral rim of enhancement and a small
anterior fluid
collection. This could represent retractor/clamp-related injury
during the
surgery or a small focus of infection. Correlation with
ultrasound is
recommended.
5. Small non-occlusive filling defect in the right internal
jugular vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment.  Underwent pylorus-preserving Whipple
and open cholecystectomy [**2145-2-25**] without complication. After a
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, NG tube and JP
in place. She was on a Dilaudid PCA for pain control with
adequate pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

[**2145-2-26**]: Remained stable on IVF, NPO. Pain well controlled on
Dilaudid PCA. On pathway w/o events.
[**2145-2-27**]: Experienced diffuse wheezes, bothersome cough. O2
requirement 3L. Blood and sputum cultures sent. Started on
xopenex and atrovent nebulizer treatments. Hemodynamically
stable at that time.
[**2145-2-28**]: Worsened from respiratory standpoint; CXR revealed
developing bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
Chest CT confirmed finding; did not reveal PE. ABG was
7.46/42/98/31.  She was placed on a NRB with improved SaO2 in
90s. IV Vancomycin started. Due to further worsening of
tachypnea and hypoxia, patient was transfered to the SICU. Once
arrived on ICU, IV Levaquin was also started, patient was
presumptively placed on Heparin drip as a precaution against PE,
Lovenox restarted. Intensive respiratory therapy. Gentle
diuresis. Continued on a Dilaudid PCA for pain control with good
effect. A-line placed with improvement of PaO2. Cough improved
with cough supressants. Blood cultures sent.
[**2145-3-1**]: Started on IV Zosyn. Continued intensive respiratory
toilet and PT. [**Last Name (un) 1372**]-pharygeal and expectorate sputum cultures
sent. Intubated. Underwent bronchoscopy with BAL of (R)lower
lobe and (L) upper lobe.
[**2145-3-2**]: Extubated in morning, maintaining saturation.
Vancomycin dose increased. Started on sips, then clears with
good tolerability.
[**2145-3-3**]: Tolerating face mask, tolerating regular diet, IV KVO.

[**2145-3-4**]: Decreased O2 requirement, CVL discontinued. Changed to
PO medications. Transfered back to floor on PO Levaquin as only
antibiotic.
[**2145-3-5**]: Experienced severe lower back spasms most likely from
prolonged time in bed; treated successfully with IV Dilaudid and
Valium, subsequently converted to PO medications. Increased
activity out of bed also helped to resolve issue.
[**Date range (3) 81710**]: Continued increasing activity level with
improved tolerance and decreasing O2 demand, until patient able
to ambulate the floor without supplemental oxygen. Continued on
aggressive nebulizer treatments and chest physical therapy.
Tolerated diet. Muscle spasms subsided and pain well controlled.
Repeat Torso CT and CXR demonstrated improvement of pleural
effusions as patient continued on PO Levaquin. Also, no leaks or
fluid collections evident on Abdominal/pelvic portion of CT
study.
[**2145-3-10**]: Patient demonstrated ability to ambulate floor and
up/down stairs with stable SaO2 and pulse, without the need of
supplemental oxygen.  Pain remained well controlled. Tolerating
regular diet. No further signifiant events.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable viral signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  Respiratory status was stable on inhalers. The
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions
with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge
plan.
