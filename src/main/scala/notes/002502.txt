History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 20179**] is a 85 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD, cerebral
vascular disease, chronic kidney disease (BL Cr 1.8), who was
orignally admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital on [**2101-2-19**] with
right lower extremity infected gouty arthritis and hemoptysis in
the setting of an INR of 9. He was also diagnosed with a
penicillin senstitive enterococcus UTI. His INR was reversed
with vitamin K. The 1st right MP joint was aspirated and a right
foot xray and MRI were negative for osteomyelitis. He was
started on colchicine which he did not tolerate, so then was
switched to a prednisone taper in addition to IV Vancomycin for
presumed MRSA infection. He was discharged to rehab on [**2101-3-8**] on
a 7 day course of Keflex with diagnoses of UTI and right foot
superinfected MSSA gouty arthritis (uric acid level 8.4). On
[**3-12**], he was readmitted from rehab with scrotal cellulitis;
scrotal U/S at OSH showed normal intrinsic blood flow in both
testes. He was started on 3g [**Hospital1 **] Unasyn for this with
improvement.
.
On [**2101-3-13**], he started to experience hemoptysis, SOB, and chest
pain. An EKG showed ST depressions in the lateral leads and
troponins were trending up: 0.11 --> 0.18. An echo done on
[**2101-3-13**] at the OSH showed LVEF 35-40% (BL 55%) and global LV
hypokinesis.
.
Of note, for his hemoptysis, at OSH AFBs were negative during
his first admission. On [**3-13**], he was noted to have a low Hgb of
7.8 (BL 10), which was 9 on repeat blood draw. Most recent
Hgb/HCT on day of transfer: 9.2/29.1. He received no
transfusions at OSH. On [**3-6**], iron studies at OSH revealed:
Fe 24, TIBC 146, Ferritin 600, B12 616, and folate 12.1.
Pulmonary saw him and felt the hemoptysis was secondary to a
pneumonia. Follow-up CXR showed a resolving RLL infiltrate at
OSH. Patient denied any BRBPR or black tarry stools but does
have history of colon cancer, s/p resection. His stools were
guaiac negative x 1 at OSH.
.
At the time of transfer, vitals were: 97.5, HR 84 sinus, RR 22,
BP 152/92, O2 sat 94% 4LNC. CXR at OSH showed right lung
pulmonary edema. He was given lasix 60mg IV then another 20mg IV
and has had no chest pain or dyspnea on the morning of transfer
on SL NG. He received 3 doses of mucomyst, xopenex nebulizers,
and 3 grams of ampicillin for his scrotal cellulitis. He was
also clopidogrel loaded: received 75mg on AM of transfer and got
300mg x 2 the day prior. He is being transferred to the floor
prior to cath for evaluation given his multiple active medical
issues.
.
On evaluation on the floor, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 20179**] reports feeling well. He
states that he has had no chest pressure since this morning. He
states that he continues to have red hemoptysis multiple times
per day along with a productive cough which has been new the
past week. He denies fevers, chills, nightsweats or weight loss.
He reports feeling well up until late last week when he began
having SOB and chest pain at rehab after doing PT exercised in
bed. Prior to that, he had not had chest pain for many years per
his report. He is not aware that he has ever had an MI in the
past. He denies palpitations, current chest pain, PND, but does
endorse orthopnea and DOE.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
He has a history of ischemic stroke >10 years ago and multiple
TIAs and is s/p R carotid endarterectomy. He denies history of
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, or joint
pains except for his R toe gout. He endorses new cough and
hemoptysis, but denies black tarry stools or BRBPR. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
