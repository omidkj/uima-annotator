Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 106322**] is a 51-year-old woman with a pmhx. of bipolar
disorder and hypothyroidism who is admitted with hypercarbic
respiratory distress in the setting of an asthma exacerbation.
Ms. [**Known lastname 106322**] states that she felt ill a few days prior to
admission with nasal congestion, mild cough, and subjective
chills.  She then started wheezing about 48-hours prior to
admission, using her albuterol inhaler frequently.  However,
symptoms progressied and she presented to the ED for further
evaluation and treatment.

Ms. [**Known lastname 106322**] has a long history of asthma beginning in
childhood.  she has been hospitalized in the ICU 4 times for
asthma exacerbations but has never been intubated.  Her typical
trigger is URI, and she states all of her hospitalizations were
for post-viral asthma attacks.

Initial vitals were: afebrile, HR 120, BP 150/88, RR 24, 95% on
NRB.  She was able to speak in [**12-29**] word phrases and was using
accessory muscles to breathe.  She was placed on a
non-rebreather.  She was treated with back-to-back nebulizer
treatments (albuterol-ipratropium-albuterol), methylprednisolone
125mg IV x1, magnesium sulfate 2g x1 with initial success.  CXR
showed hyperinflation without effusion or consolidation.  She
improved and was able to speak in full sentences and to sit
upright without accessory muscle use.  She was weaned to 2-3L
NC.  After roughly 90 minutes she began to wheeze and was again
given an albuterol nebulizer with good effect.  She remained on
NC on transfer to ICU.  VBG:  7.28 / 58 / 75.  On arrival to
MICU, patient's VS: 97.5  HR 108 112/73 sat 97% on 6L NC.  In
the ICU, patient was continued on prednisone 40mg QD.  She was
also started on flovent.  Her vitals remained stable aside from
tachycardia, and on day after admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 106322**] was
transferred to the general medicine floor.

A 10-point review of systems is negative aside from what is
described above.

Past Medical History:
1) ASTHMA
Per recent Allergy Note:
-elevated IgE levels being worked up for Job's syndrome
(hyper-IGE)
-hx asthma since childhood
-few significant asthma flares requiring hospitalization
-never intubated & responded to prednisone and antibiotics
-flare in [**2140**] due to overgrowth of aspergillus in her apartment
-under good control on Flovent/Zafirlukast and Albuterol PRN
-history of one sputum culture with pseudomonas, all others oral
flora
Per recent pulm note: Spirometry [**2153-1-25**]:demonstrates an FVC
of 3.97 liters, which is 110% of predicted with an FEV1 of 2.10
liters, which is 77% of predicted, with an FEV1/FVC ratio of 53.
Compared to the last spirometry obtained in [**2152-7-27**],
there has been a significant decrease in her FEV1.  This
demonstrates a mild obstructive ventilatory deficit.

2) HYPOTHYROIDISM: on levothyroxine, last TSH 0.36 on [**2153-9-3**]

3) BIPOLAR DISORDER: on seroquel and gabapentin

4) ECZEMA

5) ELEVATED IGE
-elevated IgE levels being worked up for Job's syndrome, however
recent Allergy note states this is unlikely diagnosis

Social History:
The patient lives in [**Location 27256**].  No history of tobacco, EtOH,
or other drugs.  Has had dogs for years; has a puppy at home
currently.  Used to work as an interior decorator.  Curently
unemployed.


Family History:
There is no family history of asthma, atopy, or other pulmonary
disease. No family history of cancer.


Physical Exam:
VS:  Afebrile, 100, 128/67, 92% on RA
GENERAL:  Anxious, using accessory muscles but breathes
comfortably when distracted, speaks in full sentences
HEENT:  Mucous membranes moist
CHEST:  Diffuse wheezes bilaterally, but moving air
CARDIAC:  Tachycardic, normal S1 and S2
ABDOMEN: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended
EXTREMITIES:  Thin, in compression boots, no edema bilaterally

CXR [**2153-9-3**]:

Compared with [**2153-9-2**] at 20:28 p.m., no significant change is
detected.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  The heart is not
enlarged.  The pulmonary hila are unchanged.  No CHF, focal
infiltrate, or effusion is detected.  Tiny (<1mm) rounded
density adjacent to the left first rib likely represents a
vessel seen on end.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Focal ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe and
scattered
micronodular tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities with bronchiectasis in the
bilateral lower
lobes is most consistent with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] infection, possibly acute
on chronic.
2.  Calcified pulmonary nodules, mediastinal lymph nodes, and
splenic nodules
are consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
