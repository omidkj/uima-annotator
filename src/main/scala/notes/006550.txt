Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
bladder perforation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84y/o male NH resident transferred from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) **] with extraperitoneal bladder perforation.  Pt presented
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] earlier today with incrasing confusion, SOB and
hematuria s/p foley change last night at his nursing home. At [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) **], a three-way foley was put in and bladder irrigation was
done.  A CT Abdomen showed extraperitoneal bladder rupture and
an anterior fluid collection.  He was given 500 mg IV Flagyl and
Levaquin 500 mg IV.  He was also given 10U regular insulin bc he
was found to have a glucose of 1021.  Also, found to have
Lactate of 7.1 and Na of 126.  Pt was also given total of 2.5L
NS in boluses. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, VS: T 98.6 BP 96/60 HR 92 RR 20 O2Sat 97% on 2L NC.
There, pt was tachypnic to 35.  RIJ line was placed. q1h
fingersticks and q2h chem 7 were done and an insulin gtt at 8
units per hours was started.  He received a total of 3L NS IV,
SBP remained in 90s.  He had 1.5L of UOP in ED. No antibiotics
were given in the ED here.  Surgery and Urology were c/s.
Urology rec foley catheter to drainage, clamp CBI port, do not
irrigate bladder, when stablized, CT cystogram and possible IR
drainage of extraperitoneal fluid collection after CT cystogram.
.
On the floor, pt was tachypnic 28-30, complained of no pain. Pt
was awake, oriented x1, unable to communicate effectively.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES::
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the patient
position has considerably changed. There is very likely a
decrease of the extent of the pre-existing left pleural
effusion. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma appears unchanged.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No newly occurred focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

[**2160-7-31**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2160-7-31**]:
The mandible obscures much of the upper lungs. The unencumbered
portion of the right lung is clear. There is probably
atelectasis at the base of the left. Heart is not grossly
enlarged.

Final Addendum
ADDENDUM:
Upon further review of the CT from [**2160-7-27**], the prominent
gas-filled structure that extends transversely across the upper
abdomen corresponds to an extremely dilated stomach with
significant fluid contents. NG tube placement is recommended.
The remainder of the small and large bowel are not well
visualized, but appear nondilated.  These results were discussed
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2160-8-2**] at 10:20 a.m.

Approved: SAT [**2160-8-2**] 12:35 PM
Final Report
HISTORY: 84-year-old male with distended abdomen with
coffee-ground emesis.

ABDOMEN, THREE VIEWS: Evaluation is limited by extensive
overlying soft
tissue. The bowel gas pattern is not significantly changed from
CT on
[**2160-7-27**]. There is a dilated loop of transverse colon measuring 13
cm,
associated with an air-fluid level on lateral views. However,
gas is present in the rectum and in multiple nondilated bowel
loops throughout the abdomen. There is a small amount of
retained stool in the right colon.  There is a small left
pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Chronic ileus, stable since prior CT.

Radiology Report CT CYSTOGRAM (PEL) W/O CONTRAST Study Date of
[**2160-7-27**] 12:04 PM

Provisional Findings Impression: CXWc SUN [**2160-7-27**] 1:30 PM
Urinary bladder demonstrates thickened trabeculae and numerous
diverticuli, which explains the irregular contour and air-filled
foci on yesterday's non- constrast scan. No extravasation of
contrast or fluid collection; no evidence of perforation.
Surrounding inflammatory changes are c/w cystitis. Dilated,
fluid-filled appendix with mild inflammatory changes stable
since yesterday, and c/w report of chronic appendicitis on prior
studies from [**Hospital1 2025**]. Enlarged, fluid-filled stomach, with fluid in
the distal esophagus increases risk for aspiration.
Final Report
INDICATION: 84-year-old man with report of ruptured bladder.

COMPARISON: Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained
at [**Hospital 2538**] on [**2160-7-26**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the
pelvis before and after instillation of 150 cc of diluted
water-soluble contrast into the urinary bladder. Post-cystogram
images were also obtained through the abdomen. Multiplanar
reformatted images were generated.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: At the lung bases, there is mild
dependent atelectasis bilaterally but no consolidation or
pleural effusion. The heart is enlarged with coronary artery
calcifications. There is no pericardial effusion.

In the abdomen, the absence of intravenous contrast limits
evaluation of solid organs. However, the liver, gallbladder,
spleen and duodenum are
unremarkable. The pancreas demonstrates fatty replacement. The
stomach is
distended with fluid, and the distal esophagus is mildly
patulous and also contains fluid, placing the patient at
increased risk for aspiration. Adrenal glands are prominent
bilaterally, without definite nodule or mass. Kidneys
demonstrate no calculus, hydronephrosis or hydroureter. On the
left, there is a moderate extrarenal pelvis. The abdominal aorta
demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications but is normal in
caliber. Small lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and mesentery
do not meet size criteria for abnormality. There is no free air
or free fluid in the abdomen. Small amount of stranding in the
retroperitoneum extends from duodenum toward right lower
quadrant about the appendix, but appears somewhat decreased from
the CT at [**Location (un) 620**] of the previous day.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Diluted, water-soluble contrast
was instilled into the patient's urinary bladder via an
indwelling Foley catheter. This demonstrates a markedly
trabeculated bladder with numerous bladder diverticuli,
explaining the lobulated, irregular contour noted on
non-contrast scan. There is no evidence of contrast
extravasation. Multiple bubbles of air are trapped within
individual diverticulae consistent with presence of Foley
catheter. There is continued thickening of the bladder wall and
stranding about the bladder although slightly improved from
prior. The prostate is enlarged measuring 5.1 x 6.3 x 5.6 cm.
There is no fluid collection in the pelvis.
Appendix is again noted to be dilated and fluid filled with
a
