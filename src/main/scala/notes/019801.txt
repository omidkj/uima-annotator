Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 74-year-old
man with a history of lung cancer and coronary artery
disease, who underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at an
outside institution to assess chronic abdominal pain.  During
that study, the patient developed acute pulmonary edema which
required treatment with Morphine and Lasix.  He was admitted,
had an echocardiogram which revealed an interval decrease of
ejection fraction to 15-20% from a previous echocardiogram
showing "preserved ejection fraction."

Subsequently, the patient underwent a stress test showing
apical and inferior perfusion defects.  Diagnostic
catheterization was performed which showed multivessel
coronary artery disease including a 45% left main lesion, 70%
mid left anterior descending artery, and 95% proximal right
coronary artery, and 80% mid right coronary artery lesions.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for intervention.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient immediately went to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory.  A left ventriculogram revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, coronary angiography
revealed a right dominant system with a 40% left main
coronary artery lesion, 70% proximal left anterior descending
artery lesion, normal circumflex, and a 90% distal right
coronary artery lesion.  Patient underwent rotablation and
stenting of the proximal right coronary artery lesion and
stenting of the distal lesion.

Catheterization was complicated by postprocedural
hypertension requiring dopamine for maintenance of pressure.
He was then transferred to the CCU for further management.

Of note, the patient had also recently undergone workup for
hypotension and has been tentatively diagnosed with autonomic
dysfunction being treated with midodrine and Florinef.  The
autonomic dysfunction was thought to be secondary to his
diabetes.  At the time of admission to the CCU, the patient
was pain free without complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2177**] with ejection fraction of 15-20%.
2. Hypertension.
3. Type 2 diabetes on insulin.
4. Chronic pancreatitis.
5. Lung cancer Stage III status post right pneumonectomy and
chemotherapy.
6. Patient with negative bone scan in [**10-31**].
7. Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance.
8. Status post cholecystectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former engineer at [**Hospital6 14475**].  He is married.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, cephalosporins, Pravachol, Zestril,
Fosamax.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin.
2. Creon with meals.
3. Protonix 40 mg q day.
4. NPH insulin 12 units q am, 8 units q pm.
5. Diovan 40 mg q day.
6. Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
7. Florinef 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **].
8. Flovent 220 mcg three puffs [**Hospital1 **].
9. Lasix 40 mg q day.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CCU:  The patient's heart
rate was in the 120s.  Blood pressure 108/60 on 3 mcg of
dopamine.  O2 sat was 97% on 3 liters.  In general, he was
alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.  Jugular
venous pressure was at 8 cm.  His lungs revealed decreased
breath sounds on the right status post pneumonectomy.  He had
crackles at the base on the left side.  His heart examination
was tachycardic with a normal S1, S2.  No murmurs were noted.
Abdomen was soft and nontender with a well-healed incision
from a pneumonectomy.  Extremities were without peripheral
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular.
A:  Coronary artery disease.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization as described in history of present illness,
and was brought to the Coronary Care Unit.  Transient
requiring dopamine for maintenance of blood pressure.
Dopamine was weaned over the first few hours upon arrival to
the CCU.  For his coronary artery disease, he was continued
on aspirin and Plavix.  His groin site from the
catheterization was stable without any development of
hematoma or bruit.

As his blood pressure tolerated, he was begun on Lopressor
12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], which was increased to 25 mg in the morning and
12.5 in the evening.  On the day of discharge, he was
continued on aspirin and Plavix.

B: Pump.  Patient underwent echocardiography to evaluate his
left ventricular function postcatheterization.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with
severely depressed overall left ventricular systolic function
with inferior and septal hypo or akinesis.  It was noted that
the RV cavity as well as the right atrium were compressed
likely by the liver, edge of the right lung.  This
compression produced 16 mm Hg gradient across the tricuspid
valve.  The patient was also noted to have 1+ mitral
regurgitation.

He was diuresed with Lasix prn for heart failure and was
loaded on digoxin with 0.25 mg q6h x4, and begun on a daily
regimen of 0.125 mg.  At the time of discharge, he was
increased to 0.25 mg and further diuresis was held to ensure
adequate preload given the compression of the right atrium.

C: Rhythm.  Again the patient was begun on Lopressor as
above, and he was in sinus rhythm throughout his
hospitalization.

2. Hypotension:  Excluding the initial postcatheterization
hypotension requiring dopamine, the patient's systolic blood
pressures were maintained in the 80s-90s for the first day of
his admission which then came up to the systolics in the 1
teens to 130s.  He was continued on his midodrine and
Florinef without any evidence of orthostasis with ambulation.

3. Pulmonary:  The patient was on oxygen by nasal cannula and
titrated to keep oxygen saturations greater than 92%.  At the
time of discharge, he was requiring no oxygen and was sating
all on room air.

4. Endocrine:  The patient is type 2 diabetic on standing
doses of insulin.  Once he was taking po, following
catheterization, he was reinstituted on his outpatient doses
of NPH insulin and covered with sliding scale of regular
insulin.  He had good glycemic control throughout his
hospitalization.

5. Gastrointestinal:  Chronic pancreatitis.  The patient was
continued on his pancreatic enzyme replacement of Creon with
meals and was given Protonix.

6. Asthma:  The patient was continued on his outpatient
inhalers including Flovent and salmeterol.  He tolerated the
beta blocker well with no exacerbations of his asthma during
his hospitalization.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient is instructed to followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11679**] this week.  He will call to make an appointment,
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5455**].  After evaluation by physical therapy, the
patient was deemed safe to return to home and he was
discharged to home in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Multivessel coronary artery disease status post stenting
of the right coronary artery with rotablation of the proximal
lesion and stenting of the proximal end distal lesions.
2. Stage III lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy.
3. Orthostatic hypotension.
4. Type 2 diabetes.
5. Chronic pancreatitis.
6. Asthma.

1. Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day.
2. Midodrine 10 mg po tid.
3. Florinef 0.1 mg po bid.
4. Salmeterol 1-2 puffs [**Hospital1 **].
5. NPH insulin 12 units q am, 8 units q pm.
6. Lopressor 25 mg q am, 12.5 mg po q pm.
7. Protonix 40 mg q day.
8. Creon two caps po qid with meals.
