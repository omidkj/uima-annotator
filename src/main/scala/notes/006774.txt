Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted the night prior to operation.  He was
taken to the OR on [**4-29**] for the transureter-ureterostomy, which
was uneventfull except for EBL of 1600, for which he recieved 2
units PRBC and 2 units FFP.  He was admitted to the ICU post
operativly for monitioring.  He had epidural for pain control
which was managed by the acute pain service.  He was sent to the
floor on POD 1 after his condition stabilized.  He was seen by
cardiology for his history of CHF, who recommeded temporarilly
increasing his lasix and getting him back to his pre-op weigh.
This was done and then his lasix was returned to his preop
dosing.  His drain was d/c'ed on POD 2.  His diet was advanced
rather slowly due to a post op ilius.  This necessitated him
being put onto sips only for one occasion.  By POD 6 however, he
was taking solid food, his pain was well controlled and his
nephrostoly was functioning well.  He was d/c'ed home with
services at this point
