Chief Complaint:
Cough, dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11503**] [**Known lastname **] [**Doctor Last Name 11504**] is a 78y/o lady with asthma, DM2, multiple
abdominal surgeries for SBOs after perforated jejunal
diverticulim in [**2191**], and falls with recent Colles' fracture who
presented to the ED due to cough and dyspnea and is admitted to
the MICU due to elevated lactate.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 11505**] for hypotension
after
reported fall (unclear etiology, hypotension resolved), as well
as altered mental status (presumably related to medications
received for her wrist fracture, resolved with Narcan).  Of
note, on that presentation she received steroids in the ED
because she was wheezy but they were not continued.  She was
initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but was transferred to the floor
and was discharged home.  No elevated lactate during the
previous admission.  No changes were made to her medications.
.
She reports that since discharge, she has felt quite weak.  She
has had gradually worsening shortness of breath and wheezing
associted with a cough productive of white sputum.  No fever but
has had chills and sweats.  Non-exertional chest tightness
associated with the wheezing.  Reports worsened symptoms upon
waking up in the AM.  She continued using her Advair [**Hospital1 **] as well
as PRN Albuterol inhaler and nebs with minimal improvement.  She
had a PCP visit to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u her hospitalization on [**6-9**] (6 days ago)
and was started on Prednisone 20mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, decreased to
20mg daily three days ago (she did take it this AM).  She says
that the dyspnea progressed, and today she tried taking a warm
shower to see if her symptoms got better but instead she felt as
if she was choking to death so she presented to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  T 98.2, HR 100, BP 148/66, RR 28,
POx 100% RA.  On exam, she had scattered wheezes.  She received
ASA and SL NTG; EKG was not concerning.  Labs were notable for
WBC 15.4 (85.6% PMNs, no bands), Na 130, bicarb 16, and lactate
5.3.  CXR showed no acute process.  She complained of some mild
abdominal discomfort so given her h/o SBO's she underwent CT
abdomen that also showed no acute process.  She received
Vanc/Zosyn, Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, Insulin 6U for glucose
in the 300's, and Tylenol 1g PO.  After 6L normal saline, repeat
lactate was 4.5 so she was admitted to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she still feels very short of breath but
can speak in full sentences.  Is worried that the Prednisone has
made her [**Doctor Last Name 11506**] without helping much, and that it has made her
blood sugar out of control.  Denies any fevers.  No rhinorrhea
or sinus congestion.  No sick contacts at home.  No recent
antibiotics.  She has continued left wrist pain from her
fracture.  No more abdomnal pain - she says that the pain she
had in the ED was mild dull peri-umbilical pain that she thinks
was related to being hungry, as well as swallowing phlegm - and
did not feel like the pain she had during SBO's.  No
constipation/obstipation.  When asked if she thinks she has had
poor PO intake recently, she denies.  Drinks a lot of water.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
(+) Per HPI.
Also notable for continued back pain and left wrist pain, very
poorly controlled FSBS in the setting of Prednisone (up to
400's), continued polyuria related to her DM2 but no dysuria.
Also had mild headache related to coughing frequently but this
has resolved.  Has intermittent reflux for which she takes OTC
medications, but none recently.
(-) Denies fever, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache,
sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies palpitations,
or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or
changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria or urgency. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.
