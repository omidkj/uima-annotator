CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an year-old Russian
speaking man with a history of hypertension, abdominal aortic
aneurysm and diastolic dysfunction who presented initially
with acute dyspnea.  He had acute dyspnea the evening of
[**2193-10-23**] and activate EMS.  They arrived and thought he was
in acute pulmonary edema and was given 3 sublingual
nitroglycerins and 100 mg of intravenous Lasix.  He improved
with systolic blood pressure initially decreasing from 200 to
160.  In the Emergency Department, however, he was found to
be hypotensive and was given 750 cc of normal saline without
much effect.  At that time he was started on Dobutamine and
Dopamine with marginal improved systolic blood pressure.  At
that time he was evaluated by the coronary care unit resident
and was transferred for further evaluation.

The patient reports that he was not aware of coming to the
hospital and may have lost consciousness.  His wife
reportedly described him being dyspneic, tachypneic, but
denies chest pain, palpations, cough, fevers or chills.  He
also denies lightheadedness or dizziness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm for which he has declined
surgery.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Status post appendectomy.
4.  Urinary frequency.
5.  Colonic polyps.
6.  Cardiac history with echocardiogram in [**2193-6-9**]
showing EF of 65%, mildly dilated left atrium, mildly dilated
right atrium, moderate amount of aortic regurgitation, mild
amount of tricuspid regurgitation, impaired relaxation and
mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.  Stress was done in
[**2192-11-9**], which showed no perfusion defects.
7.  History of obstructive lungs disease with FVC of 1.78,
which is 67% predicted and FEV1 of 0.86 50% of predicted.
8.  Question of obstructive sleep apnea for which he was
supposed to pursue a sleep study.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, which causes syncope.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] immigrated from
[**Location (un) 4551**] in [**2188**].  He is primarily Russian speaking.  He is a
former math professor.  He denies alcohol or smoking.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Procardia.
2.  Atenolol 100 mg once a day.
3.  Univasc 15 mg twice a day.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg once a day.
5.  Ditropan 5 mg po t.i.d.
6.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Lactulose.
8.  Metamucil.
9.  [**Doctor First Name **].
10.  Zyrtec.
11.  Aspirin.
12.  Atrovent two puffs q.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.8.  Heart rate 82.
Blood pressure 84/46.  Respiratory rate 24.  Sating 97% on
nonrebreather.  HEENT examination normocephalic, atraumatic.
Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck supple.  No
lymphadenopathy. JVD is not shown.  Pulmonary no wheezes.
Bibasilar crackles.  Cardiovascular normal S1 and S2.  There
is an S3 and S4 gallop.  Abdomen normoactive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Palpable pulsatile mass.
Extremities no pitting edema.  Neurological alert and
oriented.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.4,
hematocrit 48.6, platelets 224, INR 1.1, PTT 24.3.  Chem 7
showed a sodium of 140, potassium 5, chloride 101, bicarb 28,
BUN 16, creatinine 0.9, blood sugar 168, calcium 9.7,
magnesium 2.3, phos 4.4.  First CK was 90 with a troponin
less then 0.01.  Urinalysis showed trace blood, less then 1
red blood cells and rare bacteria.  His electrocardiogram was
noted to be sinus at 75 beats per minute, ST depressions in
V5-V6, ST elevations 1 mm in V1 and V2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypotension:  The patient was kept in
the Coronary Care Unit until he was finally weaned of
Dobutamine and Dopamine.  His Univasc and beta blockers were
initially held secondary to hypotension.  On [**2193-10-24**] he was
transferred from the Coronary Care Unit to the floor.  His
ace inhibitor and beta blocker were restarted.  His calcium
channel blockers were also restarted at this time.  Repeat
echocardiogram the next morning showed no new changes from
prior.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have mild
obstructive pulmonary disease based on prior pulmonary
function tests.  His oxygen sats were in the low 90s.  When
transferred from the Coronary Care Unit he was requiring 5
liters of oxygen for sats at 93 to 94%.  It was unclear his
baseline oxygen requirement.  He was discharged on O2 during
his admission in [**2193-7-9**].  However, the patient denies
using oxygen at home and is likely noncompliant with this
treatment.  With walking he desated to 88% on 4 to 5 liters.
We continued Atrovent, Albuterol and continued to wean his
oxygen.  He was minimally diuresed on [**2193-10-25**] for repeat
chest x-ray showing mild congestive heart failure and
question of lingular infiltrate.  However, given his lack of
fever and normal white count no antibiotics were started.

3.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm:  The patient declined
past surgical intervention.  Ultrasound was repeated to
evaluate for size and the size currently is 5.9 by 5.6 cm,
which is enlarged from prior.  However, the patient continues
to refuse surgery.

4.  Genitourinary:  The patient was continued on his
Ditropan.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  We continued his bowel regimen of
Colace and Lactulose.

6.  Access:  The patient needed peripheral IVs only.

7.  Code:  The patient is DNR/DNI at this time.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Home medications, otherwise no
change.

The patient was set up for a sleep study on [**2193-11-25**] with a
neurologist.  The patient has an appointment set up.  He will
be discharged to home with oxygen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Diastolic dysfunction.
3.  Hypotension responsive to fluids and pressors, now
stable.
