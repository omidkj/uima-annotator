History of Present Illness:
73 year old right handed male with hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, developed severe headache at approximately
17:00 followed by several bouts of emesis through 21:00 at which
time he apperantly  passed out  on the bathroom floor.  EMS
called and found patient with minimal speech and Left
hemiparesis.  Patient transported to [**Hospital1 18**] where BP=220/130.
Acute stroke protocol was activated. Patient brought to CT at
22:00 which revealed large Right temporal bleed with uncal
herniation and also small lesion in Right frontal, Right
cerebellum, and Right occipital regions.  CT chest revealed
hilar
mass.   Moreover, patient continued to be hypertensive and
increasingly bradycardic with signs of increased ICP and
herniation therefore Neurosurgery called.

Pertinent Results:
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2159-3-1**] 10:00 PM
IMPRESSION:
1) Multiple hemorrhagic lesions seen throughout the brain as
above, with large mediastinal nodal masses and multiple
pulmonary nodules. These findings are highly suspicious for
metastatic disease (perhaps RCC or melanoma). Correlate with
biopsy results and/or CT Torso if warranted. Please see
subsequent brain MRI for better evaluation of the smaller
lesions.
2) Left orbital enhancing lesion intimately associated with the
superior rectus muscle, likely a metastasis.
3) No aneurysm or significant stenosis, involving the
vasculature of the head and neck. Vessels in the right MCA
distribution are displaced by the large right temporal mass.
Minimal bilateral carotid bulb atherosclerotic disease.
4) Advanced emphysema.
.
CT PELVIS and CT Abdomen [**2159-3-2**] 4:13 PM
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
Multiple nodules are demonstrated in both lung bases measuring
up to 24 x 11 mm. Centrilobular emphysema is also identified.
Within the liver, multiple hypodense ill-defined lesions are
identified, the largest of which is within segment VII of the
liver and measures 24 x 11 mm, suspicious for metastases.
Multiple innumerable subcentimeter hypodensities are also seen
diffusely throughout the liver, which could represent tiny
metastases versus biliary hamartomas. There is no intra- or
extra- hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The portal vein is
patent. Within the left adrenal gland, a 22 x 18 mm enhancing
mass is demonstrated most consistent with metastasis. The right
adrenal gland is unremarkable. The spleen and pancreas are
within normal limits. The splenic artery is heavily calcified.
Both kidneys contain multiple well-circumscribed hypodense
lesions, many of which appear to be cysts. However, within the
inferior pole of the left kidney, a 28 x 26 mm hypodense lesion
appears to demonstrate mild enhancement after contrast
administration and is not clearly a simple cyst. Both kidneys
enhance symmetrically and excrete normally. Proximal ureters are
unremarkable.
Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber but demonstrates calcified
atherosclerotic plaque. Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node
within the left periaortic region measuring up to 16 mm wide is
identified. There is no free air or free fluid. There is no
evidence of bowel obstruction.
Multiple subcutaneous nodules are demonstrated within the
abdomen and pelvis, the largest of which is within the
subcutaneous fat of the right pelvis measuring up to 7 mm.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Foley catheter is
seen within the bladder which contains air within it. Coarse
prostatic calcifications are identified. Small bowel-containing,
large, left inguinal hernia is demonstrated. The bowel appears
non-obstructed without evidence of bowel wall thickening. A
large, fat-containing right inguinal hernia is also
demonstrated. No inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy is
identified. There is no free fluid.
Multiple small subcutaneous nodules are demonstrated within the
subcutaneous fat as well as adjacent to the left gluteus maximus
muscle measuring up to 10 mm wide.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread metastatic disease involving the lungs, liver,
left adrenal gland, and subcutaneous tissues.
2. Innumerable subcentimeter hypodense lesions within the liver
may represent innumerable tiny metastases versus biliary
hamartomas.
3. Multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys, the majority of
which are cysts. One hypodense lesion in the left kidney,
however, demonstrates mild enhancement and does not meet
criteria for simple cyst.
4. Large, small bowel-containing, left inguinal hernia.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-3-2**] 5:44 PM
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient for postoperative MRI following
evacuation of right-sided hematoma and evidence of multiple
metastasis.
TECHNIQUE: T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images of the brain
were obtained following gadolinium. MP-RAGE axial images were
also acquired.
FINDINGS: There are postoperative changes identified in the
right frontotemporal region. There is mild mass effect seen on
the right lateral ventricle. Multiple hyperintense masses,
indicating enhancing lesions are identified predominantly in the
posterior fossa and right cerebral hemisphere. There are at
least three enhancing lesions seen in the right cerebellar
hemisphere, and one in left cerebellar tonsillar region. There
is a faint area of enhacement in the left side of the pons.
Additional 3 small enhancing lesions are seen in the right
occipital lobe and at least two small enhancing lesions are seen
in the right frontal lobe. The lesions in the right frontal lobe
and right cerebellum measure approximately 1 cm in size with an
additional 5-10 mm lesion in the right cerebellum. Most of the
other lesions measure 5 mm or smaller. A faint enhancement is
also identified in the left temporal lobe anteriorly which is
suggestive of an additional metastasis.
At the site of surgery in the right temporal region, some
marginal enhancement is identified at the surgical cavity. In
absence of pre-gadolinium images, the assessment is limited.
IMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing lesions are identified for
therapy planning in the supra and infratentorial regions as
described above.
