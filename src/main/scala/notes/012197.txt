HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname 2048**] [**Known lastname 10680**] is a
74-year-old female with extensive past medical history
including breast cancer, status post mastectomy, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease status
post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) 359**], and cardiac
catheterization showing three-vessel disease status post
stents times two.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 10680**] was diagnosed with squamous
cell lung cancer in [**2116-8-24**] and underwent left upper
lobectomy on [**10-6**], which was complicated by
respiratory decompression secondary to mucous plugging as
well as Pseudomonas pneumonia and Klebsiella pneumonia.
Hospital course was also complicated by Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, atrial fibrillation,
Clostridium difficile colitis and ischemic colitis.  She also
previously was treated for CMV colitis with Ganciclovir.  She
has had continuous difficulties with sections and mucous
plugging requiring multiple bronchoscopies to clear the
secretions and multiple course of antibiotics.  She
previously had an ICU stay with failure to wean, complicated
by sepsis and bacteremia requiring pressors.  She is status
post tracheostomy with Passy-Muir valve.  She also has a
history of partial small-bowel obstruction and she is TPN
dependent.  She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility
(Olympus) on [**12-8**].  She was doing well until
[**12-17**], when she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest,
felt to be secondary to a primary respiratory arrest in the
setting of mucus plugging.  During the arrest she was found
to be pulseless and apneic.  CPR with DC current
electrocardioversion times one was initiated with good
response and returned to hemodynamically stable.  She had no
neurologic sequela from the arrest.  Chest x-ray, status post
cardiopulmonary arrest, showed a large left pleural effusion,
left main-stem cutoff and opacification of the left lung
which shifted the mediastinum with left lung collapse.  She
was transferred to the Medical ICU for further management of
her respiratory failure.

CURRENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the
patient to be afebrile with the heart rate of 80, blood
pressure 120/60, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 99% on
ventilator setting of pressor support of 15; PEEP 5, FI02
40%; observed tidal volumes ranging from 280 to 350.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert, awake, verbally responsive
and in no distress.  She has moist mucous membranes.  Pupils
are unequal in size, which is a chronic findings.  Neck was
supple without jugulovenous distention.  HEART:  Heart is
regular without murmurs, gallops or rubs appreciated.  LUNGS:
Lungs exhibit decreased breath sounds and bronchial breath
sounds at the left base.  There is intermittent scattered
end-expiratory wheeze heard in both lung fields, both
anteriorly and posteriorly, which varies with the timing of
her respiratory treatments.  ABDOMEN:  Slightly distended,
but nontender, with normoactive bowel sounds.  NEUROLOGICAL:
She is awake and alert.  She is responsive.  Neurology
examination is nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  The most recent labs revealed a white count
of 11,000, hematocrit 33, platelet count 222,000, PT 13.8,
PTT 26.4, INR 1.3, sodium 133, potassium 3.7, chloride 97,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 20, creatinine .5, glucose 147, ALT 11,
AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 69, total bilirubin 0.3, calcium
7.7, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.8, albumin 2.6.

Radiology reports multiple chest x-rays, performed after
admission, demonstrated tracheostomy tube in place 5-cm above
the carina, total opacity of the left hemithorax with shift
of the heart and the mediastinum to the left indicating total
collapse of the left lung.

Chest x-ray on [**12-28**], showed some improved re-aeration
of the left lung status post bronchoscopy, but persistent
collapse and some shift of the heart and mediastinum to the
left.  The most recently chest x-ray on [**1-4**], showed
slight interval improvement in the degree of atelectasis in
the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion,
unchanged when compared to prior films.  There remains
extensive left sided volume loss likely due to a combination
of left upper lobectomy and partial collapse of the left
lower lobe.  However, there was some slight interval with
improved aeration of the left lower lobe.

Chest CT performed on [**1-1**], showed again, slight
interval improved aeration of the left lower lobe with
persistent collapse of most of the left lower lobe, small
left pleural effusion, which is stable in size, as well as a
moderate right sided pleural effusion.  Note was made of a
blood clot in the junction of the left pulmonary vein and
left atrium, which had been noted on a prior CT scan and had
been evaluated by echocardiography and felt to be a lower
embolism given its location in a vein, which was then tied
off during left upper lobectomy and not in communication with
a dynamic contractile structure.

Multiple plain films of the abdomen were obtained to evaluate
abdominal distention and diarrhea.  Abdominal films showed an
ileus without evidence of small-bowel obstruction.  Serial
abdominal films over the course of the hospitalization showed
improvement of the ileus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Intensive Care Unit course by systems:

#1.  RESPIRATORY:  Little progress was achieved in reversing
the patient's persistent left lower lobe collapse and
subsequently weaning her off the ventilator.  She currently
remained on a low level of pressure support with adequate
tidal volumes and no respiratory distress.  She has required
serial bronchoscopy for clearance of thick tenacious
secretions.  Bronchoscopies have been notable for evidence of
tracheomalacia in the airways.  Interventional pulmonary was
consulted regarding possible stent placement for this
tracheomalacia, however, this was not felt likely be of
therapeutic advantage for this patient.  Consideration was
also given to possible completion pneumonectomy on the left;
however, consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**], the patient's thoracic
surgeon was obtained and it was not felt to be a viable
option at this time given the patient's overall poor
nutritional status and questionable therapeutic benefit.

Throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was
noted to have significant bronchospasm and she was treated
aggressively with inhaled corticosteroids, beta agonist,
Atrovent, and a low-dose steroid taper, with subsequent
improvement in her bronchospasm and overall improvement in
respiratory fu
