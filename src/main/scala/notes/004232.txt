History of Present Illness:
HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 86409**] is well known to the acute care surgery
service after being admitted on [**2139-1-18**] with acute
cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis.  On that day, he had a
percutaneous cholecystostomy performed and was subsequently
discharged on [**2139-1-20**] with a prolonged hospital course related
to sepsis and delirium which has resolved.  The patient also has
multiple medical problems including hypertension, chronic renal
failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and depression,
takes
diltiazem, Protonix, Zoloft, and Lantus.  He presents today for
routine followup and discussion about possible cholecystectomy.
The patient is anxious to have the tube removed as soon as
possible.  He denies pain in the area except for the drain site.

He has been moving his bowels without difficulty and eating
well.
 He is having some shortness of breath as his baseline, but
otherwise, he seems to be making a slow recovery.

trauma (pedestrian struck)

[**2139-3-27**]:  EKG:

Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy. Low precordial lead
voltage. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2139-1-8**] no diagnostic interim change.

TRACING

[**2139-3-27**]: Chest x-ray:

 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
There has
been interval removal of the previously seen left PICC line.
Opacification
over the left costophrenic angle and inferior lateral left
hemithorax may
relate to overlying soft tissue and external artifact. However,
a trace
effusion, although not seen on the lateral view cannot be
excluded, neither can atelectasis. The right lung is clear. The
cardiac silhouette is top normal

[**2139-3-29**]: Chest x-ray:

New interstitial abnormality at the lung bases and probable
right pleural
effusion are explained by cardiac decompensation. Heart shadow
and
mediastinal vascular caliber are also increased. Nevertheless,
there is
greater opacification in the right lower lung, which makes it
difficult to
exclude pneumonia.

[**2139-3-30**]:  Chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-29**], there are lower
lung volumes.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
congestion and probable bilateral pleural effusions are again
seen. It is difficult to definitely exclude pneumonia in the
absence of a lateral view.

[**2139-3-31**]:  Echo:

 Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion appear to be normal . The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Sub-optimal study but [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic
function appear to be normal with no evidence of valvular
pathology.

[**2139-4-1**]: Chest x-ray:

Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and moderate right pleural
effusion have
increased since [**3-31**]. Left lower lobe remains collapsed,
and the
larger left pleural effusion may have increased as well. Cardiac
silhouette is partially obscured, but may have increased in
size. There is no pneumothorax. Right subclavian line ends
centrally. No pneumothorax.

[**2139-4-2**]:  Chest x-ray:

 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to
[**2139-4-1**]
radiographs.

The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
The feeding tube tip is not included in the field of view but on
the prior study demonstrated it to be in the stomach. Bibasal
opacities appear to be
unchanged since the most recent prior radiograph. There is no
interval
increase in pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pulmonary
edema but
mild degree of vascular engorgement is still present, although
improved since the prior radiograph.

[**2139-4-4**]:  EKG:

Normal sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2139-4-4**] the underlying artifact has improved

Brief Hospital Course:
 Patient is a 67M with a presented for an elective
cholecystectomy. Post operatively  on day 2, he started
developing a decline in mental status and worsening respiratory
status/hypoxia. He was given lasix and diuresed ~800 with some
improvement in mental status but still had persistent
desaturations with copious secretions. He was transfered to the
SICU for management of secretions, pulmonary toilet and
diuresis.
At baseline patient with altered mental status.  He was
receiving adequate pain control with oxycodone.  He was
hemodynamically unstable and was placed on pressors.  He
responded to fluid bolus and was weaned off of pressors.  He has
a history of CHF and was given lasix 20mg for diuresis.  He was
started on his home diltia
