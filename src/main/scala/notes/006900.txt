Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for evaluation of abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
stenting of SMA and celiac arteries [**2112-5-12**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 6185**] is a 77F w DM2, HTN, HL, CAD (s/p CABG), PVDz, known
celiac/SMA stenosis, pAF (on home Coumadin), chr sys CHF (EF 20%
[**3-/2112**]), sinus bradycardia (s/p PPM), recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**]
and OSH for SOB (s/p MICU and intubation), who originally
presented to OSH 4 days ago w acute on chronic abdominal pain,
and is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
Pt reports chronic RLQ abd pain x [**1-12**] mos. Pain is intermittent,
sharp, worse w food, better w not eating, gradually worsening.
Associated w nausea and NBNB vomiting at least once daily. She
also reports chronic diarrhea ([**1-12**] loose stools per day, yellow,
non-bloody/tarry in general, though occasional drops of red
blood). No fevers, but often feels cold. Sxs have been worse in
the last 2 weeks, which prompted presentation to OSH 4 days
prior to transfer.
.
At OSH, pt was started empirically on metronidazole (d1=[**5-6**])
for C. diff colitis, though C diff toxin negative. CT A/P w/o
contrast showed diffuse thickening of colon (left, transverse,
rectosigmoid). GI there recommended evaluation by [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
surgery for mesenteric ischemia, and likely GI here for
colonoscopy.
.
Now still having diarrhea, but less, and nausea and vomiting
resolved. Of note, sister has similar sxs recently. No recent
travel, no sick contacts, no new food items. No urinary sxs.

Micro Data:

Studies:
[**2112-5-12**] Angiography/Cath of Mesenteric Vessels:
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
1. Elongated 2.5-cm long stenosis of approximately 70% to the
superior mesenteric artery with post-stenotic dilatation. There
was some sparing of the orifice of the vessel. Because of the
length, two 7-mm Genesis sounds stents were deployed to cover
the lesion appropriately. The stents expanded to their nominal
size without difficulty. There was an initial 15-mm gradient
which was reduced to less than 10 mm systolic after second
ablation of the 7-mm balloon.
2. 80% focal stenosis of the proximal celiac artery successfully
stented with a 7 x 18-mm Genesis stent. There was no residual
systolic gradient after completion of the stent.
3. A small brachial artery required cutdown initially for access
and was repaired using interrupted Prolene sutures without
difficulty.

[**2112-5-12**] CXR: The pacemaker leads are in the right atrium and
right ventricle. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in
the patient after CABG. There is still present interstitial
pulmonary edema, slightly asymmetric with more involvement of
the right side, most likely due to patient positioning. Small
right pleural effusion is noted, slightly increased since the
prior study but still small. There are no areas of focal
consolidation worrisome for infection.

[**2112-5-14**] KUB: Supine and upright film of the abdomen demonstrate
scattered
gas-filled loops of bowel with loops of transverse colon
measuring up to 6.8 cm. Air-fluid levels are seen in the upright
film, but the majority of these appear to be within the colon.
This most likely represents an ileus rather than an SBO.

[**2112-5-16**] CT Abd Pelvis, non-contrast:
1. Findings compatible with anasarca, with diffuse soft tissue
stranding/edema, marked bilateral effusions, and free fluid
within the abdomen and pelvis.
2. No specific evidence of bowel ischemia. No pneumotosis or
free air. No
obstruction.

[**2112-5-19**] CXR, pa and lateral: Slight worsening of congestive
heart failure with increasing interstitial edema.

[**2112-5-20**] KUB: Improved bowel gas pattern with air noted
throughout non-distended loops of large and small bowel. No
evidence of obstruction.

[**2112-5-22**] CXR, portable: There is no significant change in the
right PICC line, pacemaker, sternal wires and mediastinal clips,
small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, and mild
interstitial edema similar in appearance compared to the prior
study. The right IJ line has been removed.

[**2112-5-23**] KUB: Stents are seen in the upper abdomen, likely in the
celiac and SMA. The colon is prominent measuring up to 5.7 cm
with some air-fluid levels. Gas is seen in the rectum.
IMPRESSION: Ileus.

Brief Hospital Course:
77yo F w/hx of CAD, CHF, PVD, DM2, afib who presents as a
transfer from an OSH for evaluation of abdominal pain and
mesenteric ischemia.  On admission, GI and [**Month/Day/Year **] surgery were
consulted.  Her INR was elevated and she was given FFP with
plans for EGD/Colonoscopy to further evaluate her symptoms.  Her
INR was still therapeutic and this procedure was deferred.

On [**2112-5-12**], patient became hypoxic and tachypneic likely
secondary to volume overload; she was given lasix and
transferred to the MICU. Then she was taken to the OR by the
[**Date Range 1106**] team and had a brachial artery exposure and repair with
celiac artery stent x1 and superior m
