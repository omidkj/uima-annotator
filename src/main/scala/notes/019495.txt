Pertinent Results:
[**2190-1-11**] cxr: INDICATION: CHF exacerbation. Check for failure,
infiltrates, effusion.

FINDINGS: A single AP upright image. Comparison study taken
[**2189-10-23**].
The heart again shows enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. An
ICD pacemaker
is noted with electrodes in the SVC, the right atrium, the right
ventricle and
a left ventricular venous tributary. The pulmonary vessels do
not indicate
cardiac failure at this time. The lungs are fairly well
inflated. Some minor
linear atelectases are present at the bases. S/P CABG surgery
again noted.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Pacemaker
electrodes
satisfactorily positioned. No cardiac failure. No definite
effusion.
-
[**1-23**] CXR:
INDICATION: 73 year old post CABG with CHF exacerbation. Now
post right
subclavian line placement, assess for pneumothorax.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH.

COMPARISON: [**2190-1-11**].

FINDINGS:

The heart is enlarged, but stable in appearance. There has been
interval
placement of a right subclavian central venous catheter with its
tip
terminating in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. The lung
fields are
essentially clear, unchanged from the prior study. The pulmonary
vasculature
is normal. The patient is post CABG. A left-sided pacemaker is
unchanged in
position.

IMPRESSION:

Interval placement of right subclavian central venous catheter
in satisfactory
position. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly without CHF.
-
[**1-19**] kub: INDICATIONS: 73-year-old man with constipation.
Question of obstruction or
ileus.

ABDOMEN, TWO AP VIEWS: There is no free air under the diaphragm.
Multiple
large calcified gallstones are seen. Bowel gas pattern is
unremarkable
without air-fluid levels. There is not a large amount of stool
seen in the
colon. The lung bases are poorly visualized but appear clear. A
dual- lead
pacemaker appears in satisfactory position. Degenerative changes
are seen in
the lower lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or free air.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to cardiology with decompensated
[**Hospital1 **]-vCHF w/4+MR.  The patient had required nesirite and dopamine
in the past for diuresis.  These were initiated.  The patient
was placed on telemetry, which demonstrated paced rhythm.  The
patient diuresed slowly.  The rates on the drips were increased
(.01-->.015 and 2-->4).  Given the slow rate of diuresis and
large amount of fluid to be removed, the patient was transferred
to the CCU to allow for ultrafiltration.  TLC was placed in the
right subclavian and 10kg were removed, but a clot in his
ultrafiltration filters due to PTT limited this mode of
diuresis.  The patient had dramatic improvement in his breathing
following ultrifiltration.  Once diuresis was complete,
hydral/imdur were started and tolerated for two days.  The
patients pressures then dropped, not allowing continuation of
these medications.  It came up again before DC and he was
discharged on imdur with the hopes that hydralazine could be
added on discharge.
-
The patient was transferred back to cardiology service and
nesiritide and dopamine were started.  Bumex was started and the
nesiritide and dopamine drips were weaned.  Ultimately, 2mg of
bumex twice per day were needed to maintain constant I/O and
weight.
-
The patient had a gout flair concurrent with constipation.
These were treated together with colchicine .6mg Q2H X 3 then QD
with success.
-
The patient became guiac positive.    His stools became loose
(following colchicine)and CDif X 2 were taken and negative.  His
crit decreased and he became hypotensive; he had passed his dry
weight.  1U of blood w/o diuresis was adminstered and the
patient became asymptomatic.  Records of his recent colonoscopy
and EGD were obtained.  These demonstrated AVMs, diverticulosis,
hemmorhoids, a jejunal filling defect, and erosive gastritis.
GI was consulted and enteroscopy was performed.  It demonstrated
erythema in the antrum of the stomache c/w gastritis and a
single nonbleeding diverticulum with large opening in distal
descending duodenum or proximal jejunum.
-
Thyroid studies taken on admission came back demonstrating
hyopthyroidism so levoxyl dose was increased from 125 to 150.
Follow up labs one week later demonstrated normal T4 but high
TSH.  Given that TSH can lag T4 but is also a more sensitive
indicator, outpatient followup was advised.
-
The patient was seen by PT who worked with the patient on gait
training and endurance.
-
For his COPD, his flovent and solumeterol inhalers were
continued.
-
On admission, creatinine was 2.4  This value varied with
diuresis, peaking at 3.4 and hitting a nadir of 1.7.  It was 2.4
at discharge.
-
The patient was DNR/DNI throughout his stay.
