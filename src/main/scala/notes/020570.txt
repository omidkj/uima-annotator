CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 56184**] is a 73 year old woman
referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] for cardiac catheterization to further
evaluate her critical aortic stenosis and evaluate for
coronary artery disease prior to the repair of her aortic
valve.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 56184**] reports
shortness of breath starting two years ago. She recently
reports worsening shortness of breath with stair climbing and
occasionally at rest. She also reports occasional PND, two
pillow orthopnea and bilateral ankle edema, right greater
than left. Furthermore, she reports a few episodes of sharp
pains especially in her right chest while at rest. An echo
done on [**2133-5-8**] revealed preserved LV function with
tight AS and a peak gradient of 110 and mean gradient of 80
with an aortic valve area of 0.4 cm2. There was no
significant AI, MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 56185**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is significant
for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, non insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, mild anemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Appendectomy, tonsillectomy, eye
surgery.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Lasix 20 mg qd, Avandia 8 mg
qd, Zocor 40 mg qd, Avapro 300 mg qd, Prempro 0.625 mg qd and
aspirin 81 mg qd.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is 7.1, hematocrit 28.8,
platelets 206, sodium 130, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, CO2
28, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, INR 1.1.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 56184**] lives with her husband. She
denies tobacco and alcohol use. As stated previously, Mrs.
[**Known lastname 56184**] was a direct admission to the Cath Lab. Please see
cath report for full details. In summary, she had a cath that
showed critical AS with an aortic valve area of 0.4 cm2, a
mean gradient of 76 and normal coronaries.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate is 72, blood pressure
110/50, respiratory rate 16, O2 sat 99 percent on 2 liters.
Neurologically, she is awake, alert and oriented times three
with nonfocal exam. HEENT - pupils are equally round and
reactive to light. Mucous membranes are moist, normal mucosa
and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular - regular rate and
rhythm, harsh 4/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating to the
neck. Respiratory - clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen - obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds. Extremities are cool with 2+ edema. Pulses -
femoral on the left is 2+, the right is cath site, dorsalis
pedis 1+ bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally, carotids with
bruits versus radiating murmur bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was accepted for cardiac
surgery and was preopped for an AVR on [**5-21**]. Please see the
OR report for full details. In summary, the patient had an
aortic valve replacement with a No. 21 Mosaic Porcine valve.
The bypass time was 79 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 57
minutes. The patient tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit. The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period. His anesthesia was reversed. He was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated. He
remained hemodynamically stable throughout the night of his
surgery and on postoperative day 1, he was weaned from all
cardioactive medications, but remained in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit for close hemodynamic monitoring. On
postoperative day 2, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable. His Swan-Ganz catheter and central venous access were
removed and he was transferred to the floor for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation. On
postoperative day 3, the patient continued to progress in his
activity level. His chest tubes were discontinued. His wires
were removed and with the assistance of Physical Therapy and
the nursing staff, his activity level was further advanced.
Throughout the remainder of the patient's postoperative
course, it was uneventful.

On postoperative day 6, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged to home. At this time, the
patient's physical examination is as follows:  Vitals signs -
temperature 98.4, heart rate 76, sinus rhythm, blood pressure
150/60, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 94 percent on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 73.6 kg and at discharge 76.4 kg.
Lab data reveals a white count of 7.2, hematocrit 27.4,
platelets 260, sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, CO2
29, BUN 19, creatinine 1.1, glucose 128. On physical
examination, he is neurologically alert and oriented times
three. He move all extremities, follows commands. Respiratory
- clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac - regular rate
and rhythm, S1 and S2. Sternum is stable. Incision is with
Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry. Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm, well-perfused with 1+ edema
bilaterally.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], aspirin 325 mg
qd, Zocor 40 mg qd, Avandia 8 mg qd, Lasix 20 mg qd times two
weeks, Prempro. The patient is to resume preoperative
schedule and Percocet 5/325 one to two tabs q4h, prn.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
