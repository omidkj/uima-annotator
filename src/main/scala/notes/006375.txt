History of Present Illness:
70F with CAD s/p CABG, s/p hepatorenal bypass for RAS presented
with fevers and hypoglycemia. The pt reported she began
experiencing UTI like symptoms, specfically dysuria, early this
week. On Thursday she went to her PCP where she was prescribed
Ciprofloxacin. Pt states she took doses on thursday night and
twice on friday. She discontinued the medication on Saturday [**12-24**]
to nausea.  Pt reports that on Saturday PM, she noted fevers to
102F. Upon waking on the morning of admission, she felt shaky.

24. The pt subsequently was brought to the ED. The pt denies
current dysuria or back pain. She denies any cough. She notes
mild GERD like symptoms. No chest pain.

Other studies:
[**2193-6-16**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. Left
axis deviation. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
There is a late transition with tiny R waves in the anterior
leads consistent with probable prior  anterior myocardial
infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave changes which may be related
to left ventricular hypertrophy, although ischemia or myocardial
infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the previous tracing
the P-R interval and the QRS duration are longer.

[**2193-6-16**] CXR: The patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac silhouette is stable and
remains mildly
enlarged. The aorta is slightly tortuous with calcifications
again
demonstrated. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
Lungs are
clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The osseous
structures are unremarkable. Several clips in the right upper
quadrant and upper abdomen are redemonstrated.

[**2193-6-16**] CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast: 1. No acute findings to
explain patient's symptoms. 2. Left renal atrophy with severe
atrophy of the posterior aspect of the right kidney, stable. 3.
Status post aortobifemoral bypass graft, incompletely assessed
on this non- IV contrast-enhanced study.

[**2193-6-19**] CT chest w/o contrast: 1. Several foci of
peribronchiolar consolidation, mostly dependent in location. The
lower lobe findings are new compared to the abdomen/pelvic CT
from three days ago. Rapid onset and distribution favor
aspiration pneumonia as an etiology. 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
3. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, most likely reactive. 4.
Mild lower lobe bronchiectasis. 4. 5-mm perifissural nodule
versus small amount of loculated fluid mimicking a nodule at the
right lung base. Attention to this area on a follow up CT in 6
months may be considered, especially if there are risk factors
for lung neoplasm.

[**2193-6-19**] ECHO: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function (LVEF >55%). No diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary
hypertension or significant valvular disease seen. No evidence
of intra-cardiac shunt.

[**2193-6-28**] CT chest noncontrast:
1. Resolution of right lung dependent consolidation.
2. New nonspecific, widely spread patchy multifocal ground-glass
and several consolidative opacities worrisome for a new
infectious process.
Eosinophilic pneumonia is also possible considering recently
provided
history of eosinophilia. The peripheral distribution of several
of these small consolidations also raises the possibility of
embolic disease in the appropriate setting.
3. Slight interval increase in mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
likely reactive.
4. Unchanged lower lobe mild bronchiectasis.
5. 5 mm perifissural nodule versus small amount of loculated
fluid described in the previous report persists. Consideration
of a followup chest CT in six months is again recommended.
6. Mild increase in size of bilateral small pleural effusions
without
pulmonary evidence for cardiogenic edema.

[**2193-6-29**] BILATERAL LENIs: 1. No evidence of DVT. 2. Possible
pseudoaneurysm in the left groin. Recommend non-emergent
vascular ultrasound for further evaluation.

[**2193-7-2**]: FEMORAL VASCULAR U/S: Left groin pseudoaneurysm.

[**2193-7-2**] pMIBI: No significant ST segment changes over baseline
and no anginal type symptoms. Nuclear portion showed: 1. Severe
moderate-sized reversible perfusion defect involving the distal
anterior wall, apex, and distal inferior left ventricular wall.
2. Normal left ventricular size and systolic function, LVEF=57%.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70 year old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, s/p
hepatorenal bypass for RAS presenting with fever, angina, and
hypoxia.

# Hypoxic episodes: Patient had repeated episodes of hypoxia,
initially associated with chest pain throughout the first 7 days
of her hospital course.  She triggered three times for this
chest pain and hypoxia, cards consult felt symptoms were not ACS
and instead secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of
infection.  Both chest pain and hypoxia were imrpoved with NGL
initially, however, hypoxia worsened to the point of requiring
NRB with sats of 93%.  The patient was transferred to the ICU
