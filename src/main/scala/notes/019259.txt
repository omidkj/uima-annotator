Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY
.
US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2150-9-4**]
1. Slightly and coarse liver consistent with patient's known
history of cirrhosis.
2. No intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
3. The gallbladder is not distended but the wall is edematous.
These are most likely secondary to periportal hypertension.
Clinical correlation is recommended.
4. Moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
5. No evidence of ascites.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-9-4**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate right pleural effusion. Right middle and
lower lobe consolidation may represent pneumonia or compressive
atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis versus pneumonia.
RENAL U.S.  [**2150-9-7**] 3:09 PM
Reason: MRSA BACTEREMIA ,EVAL FOR ABSCESS
IMPRESSION: Normal-sized kidneys. Splenomegaly. No evidence of
perirenal abscess.
************
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2150-9-9**] 4:15 PM
1. Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. There is a
small associated right pneumothorax. There has been interval
decrease in the degree of atelectasis in the right lung. No
definite empyema is identified.
2. Findings consistent with cirrhosis, including nodular liver,
and ascites. No enhancing fluid collections within the liver or
within the abdomen, to suggest the presence of an
intra-abdominal source of infection.
*****************
BONE SCAN  [**2150-9-14**]
Reason: 55 YR OLD MAN W/ HEP C CIRRHOSIS W/ MRSA PNEUMONIA W/
EMPYMA PLEASE EVAL FOR OSTEO L HIP
IMPRESSION: No evidence for osteomyelitis. Small amount of
increased uptake in the right anterior lower ribs suggests prior
trauma.

CARDIOLOGY
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2150-9-8**]
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The aortic
valve is not well seen. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

4. No obvious evidence of endocarditis seen.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2150-9-14**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo male with h/o cirrhosis (hep C v. autoimmune) transferred
from [**Hospital1 **] with SOB x 3 week and R sided chest pain, pneumonia
on CXR, elevated lactate and hypoxia. He notes worsening SOB for
past week with pleuritic chest pain in R side. He also complains
of fatigue and dysuria. He has some cough but only occasionally
brings up sputum. He went to [**Hospital3 4107**] and was given
ceftriaxone, azithro and solumedrol. He was also found to be in
acute renal failure with Cr 4.9, K 5.7. Tox screen positive for
opiates. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on NRB bc they did not have
any ICU beds available. He denied fevers, chills, but complained
of itchy skin.  In the MICU, he was started on Vanc, Levo and
Ceftriaxone, which was eventually broadened to include flagyl.
A noncontrast CT showed a RLL consolidation and R pleural
effusion without evidence of loculation.  Thoracic surgery was
consulted and they placed a chest tube [**9-5**] with development of
small basilar PTX --> small R lateral PTX [**9-7**], with drainage
of ~1.2 L.  Pleural fluid showed 51,500 WBC, 74% PMNs, 2% Bands,
23% monos, 16,900 RBC, TP 4.4, LDH 5108, Glucose 6, Amylase 21,
Albumin 2.1 and grew out MRSA.  Blood cultures and Urine
cultures also grew out MRSA.  Serial cultures have since been
NGTD from [**9-6**] and [**9-7**].  His Abx regimen was changed to Vanc
and Levo.  His ARF was thought to be prerenal and he was gently
hydrated with IVF with a CVP between [**9-9**] to keep CVP > 12.
Urine eos were negative.  A renal ultrasound was also ordered
given MRSA in his urine to assess for renal abscess and was
negative, revealing only trace ascites and an enlarged spleen.
His BUN/Cr eventually improved from 85/4.2 to 65/1.2  Hepatology
was called because of his hx of Hep C hepatitis vs. Autoimmune
hepatitis with AST 79, ALT 71, Alk Phos 151, Bili 7.1 and
believed that it was more likely an HCV flare with hepatic
encephalopathy and cholestasis.  They recommended lactulose TID
to QID, volume resuscitation, holding aldactone until after IVF
resuscitation and stress dose steroids as well as variceal
screening once his respiratory status had improved (MELD 31).
His Liver panel improved to AST 89, ALT 58, Alk Phos 130, Bili
4.6.  He was started on labetalol and his aldactone was
restarted.  On [**9-7**], he was d/c'ed to the floor.
