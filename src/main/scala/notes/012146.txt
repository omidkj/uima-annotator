Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2193-2-13**] this 54 y/o female was admitted for placement of left
upper extremity arteriovenous graft. She is known to have have
multiple access issues/failures and an attempt was being made to
place an AVG in her left arm as the right arm has been deemed
unusable for dialysis access.
She was taken to the OR by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] who placed a left upper
arm graft initially without complication.
In the immediate post op period while in the PACU, the team was
called to assess the patients left arm  due to swelling and
obvious discomfort. The arm was rigid and there was significant
oozing. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 816**] took the patient back to the OR that evening for
evacuation of left upper extremity hematoma, control of
bleeding, and revision of the AV graft. The graft was able to be
salvaged, however the patient was kept intubated. The hematocrit
had an 8% drop. She received one unit of RBCs with good
response.
She remained in the PACU overnight and experienced hypotension
for which she was started on pressors. EKG and serial cardiac
enzymes were obtained. She was transferred to the ICU. She was
extubated but was still requiring some pressor support. She
complained of back pain, but never chest arm or jaw pain.
Serial CPK and troponins were followed which showed evidence of
MI. In addition, the EKG as interpreted by Cardiology showed an
NSTEMI. An echo was obtained showed hyperdynamic ventricles with
no specific wall motion abnormalities. In addition cardiology
did not feel a cardiac cath was indicated as she was a poor
candidate due to her co-morbidities.  Medical management was
initiated and she was started on [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Plavix. In addition a
heparin drip was initiated x 48 hours.

Enzymes continued to be cycled which slowly trended back toward
normal.
The patient received CVVH while in the ICU and then was
transitioned back to intermittent hemodialysis once transferred
back to the surgical floor and more stable.  She did continue to
have some degree of low BPs intermittently while in
hemodialysis. Last treatment [**2-19**] for which 3 liters was
ultrafiltrated via a subclavian tunnelled HD line. She also had
a R groin temporary dialysis catheter that was removed just
prior to discharge to the Nursing Home on [**2-20**].

The patient was seen by PT and recommended PT when back at her
home facility (St. Josephs in [**Location (un) 686**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) **]).

Vascular was consulted for concern about right leg lower
extremity edema, compartment syndrome vs fluid overload. It was
deemed low suspicion for compartment syndrome as the calf was
soft and pulses dopplerable.Blood pressures returned to more
normal readings (SBP in 110s) Heparin drip d/c'd after 48 hours.


She will discharge back to St Josephs where she has been a
resident.
Outpatient follow-up with cardiology is arranged and is included
in the discharge paperwork.

Doxycycline 100mg PO BID and rifampin 300mg PO bid are to be
continued  for chronic suppression of MRSA vertebral
osteomyelitis (hardware in place) for indefinite period of time.
She will need a follow up appointment with Spine Surgery.
