IMAGING:
[**8-2**] 1150AM (CT head) Multiple punctate parenchymal hemorrhages
consistent with diffuse axonal injury and stable in comparison
to prior outside hospital study from 8:56 a.m. the same day. No
evidence of herniation.

[**8-2**] 120PM (CT sinus/maxillofacial) Comminuted right lateral
wall and inferior floor orbital fractures without muscular
entrapment. Comminuted anterior and posterolateral right
maxillary sinus fractures with the sinus filled with blood.
Nondisplaced right zygomatic arch fracture. Punctate hemorrhage
within the body of the corpus callosum suggestive of
shear injury.

[**8-2**] (CT C-spine) No fracture, subluxation, or prevertebral soft
tissue swelling

[**8-2**] (MRI)Multiple intracranial hemorrhages, many subcortical
and in a distribution typical of diffuse axonal injury.
Hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space on the FLAIR images.
The
possibilities of a small amount of diffuse subarachnoid blood or
meningitis should be considered.

[**8-3**] CT head: No significant change in multiple punctate
intraparenchymal hemorrhages, most consistent with diffuse
axonal injury. No new intracranial hemorrhage.

[**8-3**]: TTE-LV grossly normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. mild post leaflet MV prolapse. R heart
structures very poorly visualized. However, in very limited
imaging, RV appears dilated and hypocontractile. IVC dilated,
suggesting elevated R heart filling pressure.

[**8-5**]: CXR PA/lat
IMPRESSION: Previously seen consolidation in the superior
segment of the
right lower lobe has better defined margins with interval
development of a
small eccentric cavitation. No new focus of consolidations.

[**2154-8-8**]:  chest x-ray:

Reported as improved RLL ( call to Radiologist, no final
[**Location (un) 1131**])



Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Acute Care team and transferred to the
Trauma ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. Neurosurgery was
[**Location (un) 4221**] initially given his brain injury; he was started on
Keppra recommended for 7 day course. Serial exams were followed
closely and because of concern for diffuse axonal brain injury
an MRI/MRA of the brain was done showing multiple intracranial
hemorrhages for which many were subcortical and in a
distribution typical of diffuse axonal injury. He was eventually
extubated and transferred to the regular floor.

Plastics was [**Location (un) 4221**] for the multiple facial fractures, it was
recommended that he followed up as an outpatient in their clinic
for discussion re: repair of these.

Once on the regular nursing unit he progressed slowly. On [**8-4**]
he was noted with an elevated white count prompting a chest xray
- results showing a vague density abutting the right minor
fissure superiorly likely representing evolving infiltrate.
Because of his HIV+ history he was started on IV Vancomycin and
Zosyn. A repeat PA/lat film was done the following day which
revealed that the previously seen consolidation in the superior
segment of the right lower lobe showed better defined margins
with interval development of a small eccentric cavitation. No
new focus of consolidations. An Infectious Disease consult was
then placed for further recommendations regarding antibiotic
therapy. Their recommendations included repeating the chest xray
to determine if could be switched to an oral antibiotic regimen.
Upon reviewed of his chest film the decision the antibiotic
regimen was changed to augmentin and ciprofloxacin for a 9 day
course

His anti-retroviral agents were confirmed and restarted during
his hospital stay.

He was evaluated by Occupational therapy and was recommended for
outpatient follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Cognitive
Neurology. His mental status improved significantly over the
course of his stay.

He is preparing for discharge home on 9 day course of
antibiotics and with follow-up with Plastic surgery in [**12-16**]
weeks.  Infectious disease aware of his discharge and will
contact him for follow up visit in [**12-16**] weeks.
