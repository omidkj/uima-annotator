Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
with angina, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital in
[**Location (un) 47**] for shortness of breath, substernal crushing chest
pain, and diaphoresis.  Cardiac catheterization there showed
3-vessel disease (left main 70% occlusion, right coronary
artery 100%, left circumflex 90%, left anterior descending
artery 80% to 90%), with an ejection fraction of 65%.

The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for possible coronary artery bypass
graft.  On admission he was noted to have ecchymoses in his
left groin area (site of initial catheterization attempt at
[**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital) and left upper extremity (site where
catheterization was finally performed at [**Hospital3 1280**]
Hospital).

On [**10-6**], the patient had an episode of syncope while on
the commode with accompanying hypotension and was transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.  The
episode was thought to be secondary to vasovagal syncope.

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service he had
another episode of syncope.  Additionally, he had several
episodes of anginal type chest pain relieved by
nitroglycerin.  An expanding hematoma in the left arm was
complicated by superimposed cellulitis, and he was started on
oxacillin and then switched to Levaquin.  The left groin
hematoma also continued to expand.  He has required several
blood transfusions due to a hematocrit drop.  Cardiothoracic
Surgery felt the patient was not a good surgical candidate
given his severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Subsequently, the patient underwent high-risk angioplasty.
Catheterization showed left main 40% to 50% stenosis, and the
left circumflex was stented.  His course was complicated by
hypotension secondary to cardiac tamponade.  A pericardial
drain was placed which drained 700 cc of frank blood.  His
hypotension resolved with dopamine and pericardial drainage.
He also sustained a right iliac dissection which was stented
at the end of the procedure.

Following catheterization, the patient was transfused 2 units
of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma
and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease with claudication.
4.  Status post bilateral carotid endarterectomy.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Arthritis.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Protonix, Atrovent, Levaquin,
Beconase, Lipitor, nitroglycerin drip, Colace, aspirin,
Lopressor, and Atrovent nebulizers.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 97,
pulse 94, blood pressure 133/50, respiratory rate 20,
saturation 93% on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Drips with dopamine and intravenous fluids.  In general,
somnolent but arousable.  HEENT revealed pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation, but enlarged
to 6 mm, dry mucous membranes, sclerae were anicteric, no
jugular venous distention.  Bilateral scars at carotids.
Cardiovascular had distant heart sounds.  Pulmonary was clear
anteriorly.  Abdominal examination was nontender and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities had severe
ecchymoses of the left upper extremity, right upper
extremity, bilateral flanks.  Skin breakdown on right arm,
draining serosanguineous fluid.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count
15.1, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 186.  Sodium 137,
potassium 4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 31, BUN 25,
creatinine 0.9, glucose of 108.  INR 1.2, PTT 26.8, PT 13.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has had a tenuous course
from a cardiovascular standpoint.  After the catheterization,
the patient continued to drain frank blood from the
pericardial drain requiring several units of packed red blood
cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets.  His aspirin and
Plavix were held during this episode.  The bleeding
eventually stopped as documented by serial echocardiograms,
and the pericardial catheter was removed without any
complications.  He was eventually weaned off the dopamine.
He was gradually started on Lopressor and diltiazem.  He
continued to have intermittent chest pain with no
electrocardiogram changes and some relief with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  Additionally, he has had episodes of
hypotension which have been responsive to fluid boluses.  It
is likely the result of multiple medications and fluid
depletion.

In light of his recurrent hypotension, the captopril was
discontinued.  He continued to be on aspirin and Plavix.  His
last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater
than 55%, and no signs of tamponade.

2.  PULMONARY:  He continued to be on 2 liters of
supplemental oxygen with saturations of 92% to 93%.  He
continued his Atrovent nebulizers, Atrovent MDI, and Medrol.

3.  DERMATOLOGY:  On the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service
he was treated with Levaquin for possible cellulitis.
However, it was discontinued in light of no source of
infection.  He continued to have severe ecchymoses of his
extremities and groin.  The effected areas had gotten
slightly better over the course of his stay.  He has had skin
breakdown in his right arm.  The wound cultures have been
negative.  The friable skin is likely secondary to long-term
steroid use.

4.  GENITOURINARY:  The patient's flank hematoma tracked down
to his testicular and penile area.  The ecchymoses is
currently stable and not expanding.  The testicular edema was
unchanged.  He has had a urinary tract infection and being
treated with a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  His hematocrit has been stable since removal
of the pericardial catheter.

6.  CODE STATUS:  Do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
