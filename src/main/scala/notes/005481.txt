cxr [**9-16**]: Position of PICC line not established, increasing
effusions.
Extensive atelectasis, left lower lobe.

cxr [**2187-9-15**]: Increasing size of the right pleural effusion which
is now
moderately large with new left lower lobe atelectasis.

[**2187-9-5**] head ct w/o contrast:
1. Acute subdural hematoma layering along the left
frontoparietal convexity, and the medial convexity of the left
temporal lobe. This hemorrhage causes 6 mm rightward shift of
normally-midline structures with minimal subfalcine, but no
uncal or transtentorial herniation.
2. Hyperdense material also layers along the midline falx as
well as above
the left posterior tentorium, representing additional acute
subdural
hematoma.
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the region of the right temporal
lobe. A tiny focus of blood layering in the right lateral
ventricular occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
4. Ventricles are stable in size when compared to the prior
examination and the other findings described are also stable
when compared to the outside hospital study performed only three
hours earlier.
5. No evidence for acute infarct.
6. No evidence for hydrocephalus.

[**2187-9-13**] head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolution of the known subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages
as above but persistent. F/u as clinically indicated.
2. Stable layering intraventricular hemorrhage within the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
3. No new intracranial hemorrhage


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU under the neurosurgery
service after falling and sustaining a SDH. He was on warfarin
at home and was given Proplex and vitamin K in the ER to reverse
his anticoagulation. Initially he had expressive aphasia but was
able to understand speech and followed commands. Later in the
day the patient became more lethargic, however his repeat CT
scan was stable. He had received some antipsychotics and they
seemed to exacerbate his confusion. On [**9-6**] he was taken off all
antipsychotics and his aphasia improved. He was able to answer
simples questions and follows some commands but has poor
attnetion. The patient was transferred to the neuro stepdown
unit that day.

On [**9-7**] that patient seemed to be waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]. At times he
was very alert and could follow commands and at other times he
was quite lethargic. He was evaluated by speech and swallow and
was unsafe to take in food by mouth. He was continued on tube
feeds.

Psych evaluated the patient and felt that the patient did have
delirium. They recommended avoiding benzodiazepines and giving
low-dose haldol.

On [**9-9**] the patient's dilantin was found to be 20.9 so his
dilantin was held until his level returned to a lower level. The
patient was also given lasix for CHF. His exam was improving and
he was following commands again that day.

On [**9-10**] the dilantin was held again for elevated level. His INR
was noted to be elevated at 1.7 but this was allowed to trend
down on its own and no medication was given for reversal.
Overnight the patient was less alert, was noted to have
tachypnea and hypoxia with oxygen saturation in the 80s. His ABG
showed metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. He was
started on vanco and zosyn for empiric coverage of hospital
acquired pneumonia. His repeat ABG was stable.

On [**9-11**] the medicine team was consulted and the patient was
transferred their service.  The patient was started on cefepime
for his hospital acquired pneumonia and as he worsened
vancomycin was again added.  His respiratory status continued to
decline.  His tube feeds were stopped in case of worsening
aspiration.  He had no evident cough reflex and likely had
continuous aspiration and inability to protect his airway.  He
was DNR / DNI prior to coming to the hospital.  The patient
expired at  11:37 a.m. on [**2187-9-16**] of respiratory failure
secondary to a hospital acquired pneumonia.
