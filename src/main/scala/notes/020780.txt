Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower GI bleed, likely diverticular

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old female with h/o LGIB [**2129**] presumed
secondary to diverticulosis, HTN, DM, hypothyroidism on no
medications x 1 year who presented with sudden onset painless
BRBPR. She denied abdominal pain, N/V, LH, dizziness,
palpitations, CP, SOB. No NSAID or other med use.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T99 HR135 BP191/90 RR28 100%RA. Exam
remarkable for bright red blood with clots on rectal exam
without melena. HCT 29 from prior baseline around 37 5/[**2137**].
.
In MICU--she received 3U prbcs and 1L NS [**5-28**]. Unable to do EGD
due to poor dentition. On [**5-29**] she had a colonoscopy which
showed severe diverticulosis but no active bleeding; she rec'd
add'l 1U prbc on [**5-30**]. Was tx'ed to floor but had ongoing
bleeding, hct was 27-->23 and was tx back to the MICU ([**5-30**]).
She rec'd add'l 2U prbcs and a tagged RBC scan which was
negative. General surgery was consulted who recommended a repeat
tagged RBC +/- partial colectomy if can target source. She rec'd
1 more unit prbcs and Hct trended up to 33.6.

TTE [**2139-6-2**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Torn mitral chordae are present. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.At
least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT chest [**2139-6-2**]: 1. Large heterogeneous multinodular thyroid
with substernal extension and compression and deviation of upper
esophagus and trachea to the right. Longitudinal dimension of
the larger left lobe of thyroid measures at least 12 cm, with
coarse calcifications inferiorly. Cannot exclude thyroid
malignancy by CT appearance. However, no local extension or
cervical lymphadenopathy.
2. Mild distension of fluid filled distal esophagus. Esophageal
contour poorly visualized due to lack of oral contrast. GEJ
poorly assessed.
3. Small curvilinear lucency along left boarder of infrasternal
goiter medial to L main pulmonary artery is of unclear etiology;
could represent air within tortuous esophagus or air within one
of the small mediastinal veins from injection. Given this
finding is incidental, esophageal perforation is felt less
likely. .
Assessment and Plan: 80 year old female with HTN, DM, h/o LGIB
likely diverticular [**2129**] presenting with BRBPR.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female with HTN and DM on no meds, h/o diverticular
LGIB [**2129**] admitted with BRBPR.
.
#. BRBPR: Patient presented with painless BRBPR and HCT 29 from
prior baseline mid 30s. Was admitted to the ICU for emergent
colonoscopy.  She had blood transfusion (7 units PRBCs).  She
had a colonoscopy that showed severe divertulosis but no active
bleeding. Was hemodynamically stable and tranferred to the floor
but had more BRBPR and was transferred back to ICU([**5-30**]). A
tagged RBC study after this was negative.
Over last 5 days of admission, HCT remained stable, at 30-33. Of
note, GI does not want any further inpatient or outpatient
workup given that bleed was likely diverticular. Appointment
made for two days from now, with PCP for patient to followup
HCT.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelets were initially low at 100 but
increased to 151 over admission. This is likely consumptive from
bleeding v. dilutional since recieved 7 U PRBCs total. DIC labs
negative- including fibrinogen and haptoglobin- and patient had
not received heparin so HIT unlikely. LDH and FDP elevated but
hemolysis thought to be unlikely with other normal values and
clinical picture (stable HCT, hemodynamically stable, resolving
platelets.)
.
#. Tachycardia: HR 130s at admission but resolved to 80s by
discharge. Most likely secondary to bleed. Diff dx also includes
hyperthyroidism given TSH<0.02 but T4 normal. Of note, TTE
(performed because patient was tachycardic with undocumented
murmur on exam) showed some ruptured chordae tendinae; per
cardiology no inpatient followup needed. - Appointments made for
Cardiology Clinic to follow.
.
#. DM2: On no medications at home, blood sugars initially high
but resolved to 100s over stay. Did not sent home with
medications;
- PCP should followup.
.
# HTN: On no medications at home and hypertensive in ED-
continued to be SBP 120s to 170s. Started Lisinopril 10 mg
daily;
- Patient should followup BP with PCP.
.
#. h/o hypothyroidism: TSH low but T4 normal. Off levothyroxine
x 1 year. Repeat tests outpatient especially given thyroid mass
(see below.)
.
#. Weight loss/Mediastinal Mass: Patient reports 10 lb weight
loss over last year and appears cachectic on exam.
Neck/mediastinal mass seen on CXR likely represents goiter. CT
further delineated mass, but differential still goiter v.
malignancy. Of note, there is mass effect on esophagus and
trachea which needs to be worked up soon for possible surgical
removal.
- Appointments made with both PCP and [**Hospital 1800**] clinic for
followup.
.
Patient was discharged home with PT.
