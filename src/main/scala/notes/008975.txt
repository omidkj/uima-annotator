Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2189-1-15**] - Left heart cardiac catheterization with bare metal
stent placed in the LAD


History of Present Illness:
52 year old male with coronary artery disease s/p MI s/p PCI to
LAD and LCx ([**2181**], [**2186**]) and s/p right atrial tachycardia
ablation [**6-/2188**] with decreased ejection fraction (EF 20% from
40% in [**2186**]), presenting with chest pain found to have STEMI
enroute by EMS.   Patient woke up 3:30 am this morning at home
and reports tightness across his chest, not localizing anywhere
specific.  Patient reports the chest pain is similar to his past
MI 4 years ago when he got stents placed in the LAD.  He took
325 aspirin PO before he got here. he is clammy. pain was [**5-4**]
initially. After nitro the pain was [**2-4**]. He was taking
lisinopril, metaprolol. Stopped taking those meds because he ran
out refills, no other reason.
.
In ED, he was 80 BP 138/100 Resp 20 O2 Sat 100%.  EKG noted STE
in V1-V4, with Qs in II, III, AVF.  Exam was notable for
diaphoresis and chest tightness 40 min prior to presentation.
Labs were notable for trop of 0.01 otherwise benign.  He was
given plavix, heparin gtt, taken to the cath [**Month/Year (2) **] for urgent
intervention.  He was found to have LAD in stent thrombosis,
used 160cc of dye, was given bival in labs. BMS x 1 to LAD, RFA
access. Angiosealed.
.
In CCU, patient appeared to be in good spirit.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2189-1-15**] CATHETERIZATION (PRELIM):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
minimal
luminal irregularities. The LAD had a subtotal occlusion of
previously
placed stent consistent with stent thrombosis. The LCx had
minimal
luminal irregularities. The RCA had minimal luminal
irregularities.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension
with central aortic pressure of 125/88 mmHg.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. STEMI with single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic arterial normotension.
.
[**2189-1-15**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is elongated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- and
distal anterior, septal and apical akinesis. There is moderate
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w LAD disease. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2188-10-13**], the findings are similar.
.
[**2189-1-15**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**7-9**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Relatively mild pulmonary
vascular
congestion without pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year-old Male with a history of MI s/p DES to LAD in [**8-/2181**]
and LCx in [**11/2186**] (on Plavix), HTN, HLD, presenting with chest
pain found to have acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction
enroute by EMS.
.
# ACUTE ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - Patient presented
with chest pain and was found to have a STEMI on EKG upon
arrival. He had a cardiac catheterization which showed a right
dominant system, known LAD, LCx lesions. He was found to have
in-stent thrombosis due to medication non-compliance, and a
single bare-metal stent was placed in LAD. The patient was
treated with Aspirin 325 mg daily. He was also changed from
Plavix to Prasugrel. He was started on Lisinopril and
Metoprolol. The patient received smoking cessation counseling
and was counsled regarding the importance of quitting.
.
# SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - The patient was known to
have severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %)
with distal LV-apical akinesis on a prior echocardiogram from
9/[**2188**]. An Echo performed during this hospitalization revealed
continued apical akinesis so the patient was started on
Coumadin. He will require repeat echocardiography and possible
evaluation for ICD placement to prevent suddent cardiac death,
in about one month.
.
# RHYTHM - The patient maintained a sinus rhythm, and had
history of recent ablation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for incessant atrial
tachycardia. No evidence of dysrrhythmia this admission other
than some intermitten
