History of Present Illness:
69yo male with history of metastatic prostate cancer was
admitted from the Emergency Department with hypotension.
.
He reports that he has had increasing weakness over the last one
week with difficulty taking more than three steps. Associated
symptoms include fatigue and light-headedness. He initially
presented to his PCP's office on the day of admission with blood
pressure of 80/palp. He was then transferred to the Emergency
Department.

Upon arrival in the ED, temp 98.2, BP 80/48, HR 106, RR 17, and
pulse ox 98% on room air. While in the ED he received ~ 3L NS
with transient improvement in his blood pressure to 101/51,
although his BP again declined to 80s/60s. He also received
compazine 10mg PO x 1 and morphine 2mg IV x 1.

MRI C/T/L spine: No cord compression is seen. Multiple
metastasis is noted.  Degenerative changes in the cervical
region with mild indentation on the spinal cord by bulging from
to C4-C6-C7. Extensive bony involvement by metastasis of upper
sacrum and both posterior iliac bones with postop possible soft
tissue extension on the left side from the iliac metastasis.
Retroperitoneal soft tissue prominence with bilateral dilated
ureters.  Further evaluation with abdominal and pelvic CT
recommended.
.

CT Abd/PElvis: The lung bases demonstrate a small left greater
than right
pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, and pancreas are
unremarkable.
Bilateral percutaneous nephrouretral stents are noted in both
kidneys. The
left kidney has moderate cortical thinning and has decreased in
size since
[**2136-2-9**]. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically
without
hydronephrosis. Bilateral internal stents terminate in the
distal bladder. The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable without evidence of pneumatosis, free air or
obstruction. There are numerous periaortic lymph nodes from the
renal veins to the aortic bifurcation, which have slightly
increased in size since [**2136-2-9**], for example, an aortocaval node
measuring 2.4 x 1.3 cm measured 12 x 10 mm on [**2136-2-9**]. There is
increased soft tissue density along the left greater sciatic
foramen and asymmetry of the left musculature as well as
increased bony destruction since [**2136-2-9**] with possible
involvement of the left sciatic nerve. A penile implant and post
prostatectomy clips somewhat limit evaluation of the distal
ureters. Pelvic free fluid and adenopathy which have increased
since [**2136-2-9**]. Bone windows demonstrate diffuse metastatic
sclerotic disease which has increased in severity at the level
of the pelvis but is otherwise similar since [**2136-2-9**]. Diffuse
anasarca is noted.
IMPRESSION: 1. Increased bony destruction and soft tissue
extension of a metastatic disease to involve the left sciatic
foramen. 2. Increased periaortic and pelvic nodes since [**2136-2-9**].
3. Diffuse anasarca has increased since [**2136-2-9**]. 4. No evidence
of hydronephrosis. There is moderate cortical thinning of the
left kidney since [**2136-2-9**].
.
Scrotal U/S: Diffuse scrotal soft tissue edema, without fluid
collection seen. Normal exam of the underlying testes.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 69yo male with metastatic prostate cancer was
admitted from the ED with hypotension, weakness, and acute renal
failure.
.
# Hypotension: He was initially admitted to MICU and IV fluid
rescusitated. Etiology of his hypotension appears most likely
related to sepsis with genitourinary source vs hypovolemia in
the setting of dehydration. UA with 11-20 WBCs and moderate
bacteria therefore he was started on zosyn presumptively.
Further management of UTI described below. Anti-hypertensives
and narcotics intially held then restarted as tolerated.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection, Complicated: Urinalysis on admission
with 11-20 WBC's and he was initially started on zosyn. This was
narrowed to ciprofloxacin then urine culture subsequently grew
STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA therefore he was
narrowed further to Bactrim. He should continue to complete a 14
day course.
.
# Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia secondary to
dehydration. Cortisol and thyroid functions tests were done to
rule out hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency and these were
normal. Sodium corrected to 128 with IVF resuscitation.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 2.4 on admission, trending
down to baseline of 1.2 with IV fluid resuscitation. Etiology
thought to be pre-renal from hypovolemia as well as UTI.
Post-renal obstruction appears less likely given that
nephrostomy tubes continue to drain.
.
# Weakness: Patient with hi
