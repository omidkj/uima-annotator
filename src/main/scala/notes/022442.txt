Service:  Coronary Care Unit and Medicine, [**Hospital1 139**] Firm

ADDENDUM:  Please see the previous Discharge Summary dated
[**2118-1-17**] for the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from
admission ([**2118-1-5**]) through discharge ([**2118-1-19**]).

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM
(CONTINUED):

1.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  On the morning of [**2118-1-12**]
the patient was taken cardiac catheterization and peripheral
angiogram.

While undergoing cardiac catheterization the patient was
noted to become hypoxic to 89% on 5 liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula.  Anesthesia was called to consider intubation.  They
decided instead to place the patient on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure which improved his oxygen saturation up to
100%.

The patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.
There, he received daily ultrafiltration to remove excess
fluid.  It was believed that his worsening respiratory status
was most likely due to fluid overload in the context of a
large osmotic load during cardiac catheterization.    With
continued hemodialysis, the patient eventually was able to be
weaned down to nasal cannula during the day and a continuous
positive airway pressure during the night.

The patient has a known of noncompliance with his continuous
positive airway pressure machine.  He states that he was not
able to tolerate [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure either.
Prior to discharge, multiple discussion were held with the
patient regarding the importance of the use of continuous
positive airway pressure during the night on his obstructive
sleep apnea.

The patient's mental status also seemed to greatly improve
with the use of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure initially
and then followed by continuous positive airway pressure
during the night.  The patient was discharged on 3 liters of
oxygen by nasal cannula during the day followed by continuous
positive airway pressure at night.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2118-1-12**].  He was found to have
native 3-vessel disease with elevated right and left heart
filling pressures.  The patient underwent stenting of the mid
circumflex with a cypher stent.  Two of his vein grafts were
also noted to be occluded.

Following cardiac catheterization, the patient was noted to
have intermittent episodes of chest pain.  Electrocardiograms
and creatine kinase levels each time were unrevealing.  The
patient was monitored on telemetry throughout the remainder
of his hospitalization and was not found to have any
significant arrhythmias.

The patient was continued on aspirin, statin, beta blocker,
ACE inhibitor, long-acting calcium channel blocker, and
Plavix throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.

3.  PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient
underwent a lower extremity arteriogram.  The patient was
noted to have serial 90% lesions of the dorsalis pedis.  The
posterior tibialis was noted to be occluded proximally.

The patient underwent angioplasty of his left anterior
tibialis.  The patient was noted to have improved flow
following angioplasty.

The patient will need to be on aspirin and Plavix for life
due to his severe peripheral vascular disease.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
oxacillin intravenously throughout the remainder of his stay
in the Coronary Care Unit and the Medicine [**Hospital1 **] Service.

He was noted to have improvement in the appearance of his
left lower extremity cellulitis.  Prior to discharge, a
peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed by
Interventional Radiology so the patient could continue to
receive oxacillin intravenously.

Blood surveillance cultures were obtained peripherally and
from his hemodialysis line.  Those blood cultures showed no
growth to date.  The patient was to be treated with a total
2-week course of oxacillin intravenously since it did not
appear that his hemodialysis line was the source of his
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization.  He did continue to have a persistent white
blood cell count, however.

5.  LEFT HEEL ULCERATION ISSUES:  The patient was continued
on wet-to-dry dressing changes as per Podiatry Service
consultation.  It was hoped that his peripheral vascular
intervention will help with the healing of his ulceration.
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Podiatry as an
outpatient.

6.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had
systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 35%.  He
was continued on hemodialysis for removal of excess fluid
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.  His
respiratory status improved.  The patient was to continue
receiving hemodialysis following discharge from this
hospitalization.

7.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ISSUES (ON HEMODIALYSIS):  The
patient continued to be followed by the Renal Service in
consultation.

Immediately following cardiac catheterization, on [**1-12**]
(during which he became acutely hypoxic), the patient
received ultrafiltration due to low blood pressures requiring
dopamine.  The patient eventually stabilized and was able to
be transitioned to hemodialysis.  The patient continued to be
aggressive dialyzed throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization.  At the time of discharge, the patient was
very close to his dry weight.

8.  TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was
initially on his home regimen of NPH 45 units subcutaneously
in the morning and NPH 40 units subcutaneously in the evening
in addition to a regular insulin sliding-scale.  However, he
was noted to have morning hypoglycemia and his nighttime NPH
dose was decreased.

9.  DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS ISSUES:  The patient was continued
on his regular home dose of Reglan.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable;
chest pain free, ambulating but requiring assistance to
ambulate, on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula (however the
patient was not compliant and often removed his oxygen), with
continuous positive airway pressure at night.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to
rehabilitation.
