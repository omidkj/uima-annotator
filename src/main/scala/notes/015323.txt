Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
Left great toe gangrene

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Amputation of the left hallux ([**2114-6-14**]), without immediate post
procedure complication


History of Present Illness:
88 yo male w/ h/o IDDM, CKD, HTN, who presented to OSH with
worsening left foot pain, swelling erythema (started around
[**6-4**]). The patient's son notes that 1 day prior to onset of
symptoms he was grinding down his father's toenails with a file,
slipped and accidentally broke the skin around the left great
toe. As per report from OSH, "his left LE extremity has evidence
of extensive cellulitis over the dorsum of the foot. There is
ulceration of the left great toe with an eschar formation".

Pt. was treated with vancomycin ([**Date range (1) 26246**]), ancef ([**6-6**]) and
zosyn ([**Date range (1) 71315**]). His cellulitis reportedly improved, but the
eschar increased in size. He was evaluated by the infectous
disease and vascular surgery teams. They felt that there was
evidence of gangrene in his left great toe and it would likely
need to be amputated. As per report, there was also concern
concern for osteomyelitis on plain films.

Family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for second opinion with
regards to surgical management. Pt. currently reports little
pain, and denies fevers/chills. He has significant diabetic
neuropathy and little sensation in b/l lower extremities.

ROS:
per HPI, denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain. He does endorse occasional diffuse
abdominal pain with bloating which radiates to left groin area.

prednisone (per pt. son)

Cath report [**6-20**]
PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a totally
occluded mid
LAD at the proximal portion of the mid LAD stent as well as an
80%
osital D1 lesion which originated just before the CTO in the mid
LAD. We
initially planned to treat the LAD and then D1 eith PTCA and
stenting.
Bivalirudin was started prophylactically. A 6 French XBLAD 3.5
guiding
catheter provided good support for the procedure. The CTO was
initially
engaged with a [**Month/Year (2) 71316**] wire and was unable to be crossed.
Multiple
wires were attempted ([**Name (NI) 71316**], CHOICE PT ES, PILOT 200 and
CONFIANZA).
The CONFIENZA appeared to cross the CTO, but a balloon could not
be
passed through the lesion, and the wire was never able to move
very far
into the distal vessel. At this point we chose to not go further
in
trying to open the CTO of the mid LAD and instead turned our
attention
to D1. A [**Name (NI) 71316**] wire crossed the lesion with minimal
difficulty. The
lesion was dilated with a 2.0x12mm SPRINTER balloon. A 2.5x8mm
INTEGRITY
RX stent was deployed in the ostium of the D1 at 14 ATMs. The
stent was
postdilated with a 2.5x6mm NC QUANTUM APEX MR balloon at 18
ATMs. Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis at the ostium of the
D1, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
Agniography of
the right femoral arteriotomy site showed a site compatible with

percutaneous closure. The patient left the lab free of angina
and in
stable condition.



Micro: UC pending

Path:
 I.  Big toe, left foot, amputation (A-D):
a.  Gangrene, focally involving skin and soft tissue margins.
b.  Underlying acute osteomyelitis.
II.  Proximal margin (E):

Bone with foci of reparative change and intra medullary fibrosis
with no significant acute inflammation; multiple levels are
examined.

Studies:
ABIs ([**2114-6-12**]):
INDICATIONS:  89-year-old male with dry gangrene of left hallux.
FINDINGS:  Bilateral lower extremity ABIs, Doppler waveforms,
and PVRs were
performed at rest.  All of the lower extremity vessels are
noncompressible.

On the right, the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and
dorsalis pedis
waveforms are all [**Hospital1 **]/triphasic.  Right-sided PVRs are mildly
diminished in the amplitude but at the metatarsal level suggest
potential for healing minor tissue loss.

The right femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial waveforms are
all biphasic. The dorsalis pedis waveform is monophasic.
Left-sided PVRs are essentially within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:  Noncompressible vessels.  Strong Doppler waveforms
with PVRs
suggest mild tibial disease on the right and mild, non-occlusive
tibial
disease on the left.
