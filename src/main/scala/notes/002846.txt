ECG [**2140-5-29**]: regular, narrow-complex tachycardia at 148 bpm,
left axis deviation, lateral ST-segment depression in V5-V6
compared with abseline ECG.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed with septal and apical akinesis
(LVEF= 25 %). Cannot exclude apical thrombus. There is distal
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 4mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
OTHER TESTING:
CXR ([**2140-5-29**]): Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates
cardiomegaly. There is mild congestive failure with essential
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. Aorta is somewhat
ectatic and the arch is calcified. There is left lower lobe
consolidation and a small left pleural effusion. The patient is
somewhat rotated.
.
CXR ([**2140-6-1**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and unchanged course and
position of the left-sided PICC line.  Also unchanged is the
minimal left apical pneumothorax. The pre-existing opacity at
the left lung base is smaller and less dense than on the
previous examination. No newly occurred focal parenchymal
opacities.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent an uncomplicated procedure.  She was
transfused 1 RBC.  She was discharged to rehab about a routine
postop recovery.  She was given written information and
precautionary guidance.

MICU Course- Patient admitted to the MICU after developing SVT,
delirium and leukocytosis on POD 3.  Prior to transfer, EKG
obtained showed sinus rhythm with borderline left axis
deviation, borderline intraventricular conduction delay with TWF
in the inferolateral leads (all changes new since previous EKG
on record [**2123**]). CXR showed likely LLL infiltrate and increased
vascular markings suggestive of CHF.  CE's trended with peak
troponin of 1.30, peak CK of 508 and peak MB of 37.  Diagnosed
with NSTEMI vs demand ischemia.  Cardiology consulted and
recommended medical management as patient could not be bolused
with heparin given recent spinal procedure.  Therefore, she
could not undergo catheterization.  She was started on aspirin
325mg, beta-blocker, high-dose statin.  She underwent TTE on [**5-31**]
which showed EF of 25% with septal and apical akinesis.

After transferring to floor, she was taken off the heparin.
Questionable thrombus in left ventricle was evulated and thought
to be old with fibronsis over it, so patient was maintained on a
full dose of aspirin.  She was not started on warfarin due to
her history of multiple falls.  She remained afebrile
thoroughout her stay.  Physical therapy evaluated her.  It was
thought that her troponin leak is rate related and her poor EF
is due to an old MI.  This post-op tachyarrhythmia revealed the
defect and cause her troponin to raise.  She remained in sinus
on the floor and was discharged in stable condition.  Her PICC
line was stopped and her foley was discharged.  She does have a
residue small apical pneumothorax which we are following with
serial CXR.  No intervention needed at this point but may need a
repeat CXR in about a week.

She has to follow up with Dr.  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3736**] Date/Time:[**2140-6-13**] 10:40.   She also needs to
wear TLSO brace while she is up and out of bed for the next 4
weeks.  She needs to follow up with her PCP for post
hospitalization followup.  Please follow up with a cardiologist
at a location near your rehab regarding further titration of
your medications.
