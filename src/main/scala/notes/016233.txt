History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2031**] is a 62 y/o male with MM s/p allo-BMT and DLI [**8-16**]
with GVHD of skin recently admitted on [**10-14**] for [**Month/Day/Year **] and
shortness of breath concerning for pneumonia or restrictive
airway disease such as BOOP. He was seen and evaluated by
pulmonary at that time. PFT's revealed a slightly restrictive
pattern, but pulmonary felt that the clinical evidence was not
too suggestive for BOOP. Since discharge, he was on levaquin,
which was subsequently switched to azithromycin by his
outpatient oncologist. In addition, his prednisone was increased
to 60 QD.
.
Today, he notes feeling increased SOB and DOE to the point that
he can no longer shave without feeling SOB. He does note
continued post-nasal drip and [**Month/Day/Year **] productive of white sputum.
His [**Month/Day/Year **] is worse while sitting up, and better while lying
down. He denies any hemoptysis. He denies any recent sick
contacts, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.
.
ROS is negative for HA, F/C, CP, SOB, Abd pain. He does complain

of bilateral shoulder discomfort R>L, an increasing level of
fatigue, and also severe mouth pain from oral ulcers

Past Medical History:
1. Multiple myeloma - s/p MUD nonmyeloablative allogeneic
transplant [**7-16**] with Campath conditioning. Past treatment
modalities include: s/p auto PBSCT in [**2188**],DC vaccine,
Thalidomide, Velcade/Doxil, Cytoxan/Doxil. He has most recently
been treated with radiation therapy and velcade in preparation
for this DLI treatment. His [**2191**] transplant was complicated by
mucositis with HSV infection, c. diff and enterococcus
bacteremia. HSV has been resistant to oral valtrex and acyclovir
but has improved with IV foscarnet, which was most recently
restarted on [**2191-11-30**]. He has had recurrent diarrhea with
rectal biopsies showing no evidence of GVHD, and c. diff was
negative.
2. Ortho: Pt has extensive skeletal involvement with myeloma.
Recent hospital amission for prophylactic rod placement in L
femur with XRT (discharged6/24/06), also with recent radiation
to
his right clavicle and right calf as well. Known lesions of Rt
clavicle, L humerus, recent fracture of L 4th metacarpal. Has
had pamidronate treatments monthly.
3. steroid-induced DM, resolved
4. CHF, [**3-15**] diastolic dysfunction Echo [**10-23**]: Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%).
5. HTN for 15 years
6. Osteoarthritis
7. Atrial flutter, s/p ablation '[**88**]
8. CRI: thought secondary to myeloma vs HTN

IMAGING:
[**11-9**] CHEST CT:
1. Evolving radiation fibrosis right apex, status post radiation

therapy to a pathological fracture of the medial right clavicle.
2. Bronchial wall thickening, mild bronchial dilation and small
airways disease within the dependent portions of the lower
lobes. Infectious small airways disease or chronic aspiration
should be considered.
3. Diffuse skeletal involvement by multiple myeloma. Destruction

of posterior aspect of the vertebral body at approximately T11,
for which it is difficult to evaluate for spinal canal
involvement on routine CT. Spine MR could be obtained for more
complete assessment if warranted clinically.
4. Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
.
[**2192-11-12**] PFT's
Please see OMR records from [**2192-11-12**] for complete values.
Brielfy, lung volumes appear unchanged, DLCO decreased slightly,

FEV1/FVC also decreased suggestive of restrictive disease.
.
CT chest [**2192-11-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with
ground glass "halos," and new ground glass wedge opacities in
the upper lobe are concerning for a progressive infectious
process. In an immunocompromised patient, Aspergillus is the
leading diagnosis. If the patient is immunocompetent,
mucormycosis is most likely. Atypical pneumonias such as
mycoplasma or viral infection are less likely. Findings were
communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. Evolving right apical post-radiation changes.
3. Widespread bone lesions did not change appreciably, the
evaluation of the D11 vertebral body lesion is difficult on the
chest CT. If warranted clinically, further evaluation with MRI
is recommended.
4. Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
.
[**12-5**] right shoulder xray: IMPRESSION
Displaced fracture of the mid clavicle, more apparent than prior
study.
.
chest ct [**12-18**]:
1. New extensive ground-glass opacities and focal areas of
consolidation, predominantly in the upper and mid lungs.
Associated extensive traction bronchiectasis. These findings
raise the possibility of an evolving acute interstitial
pneumonia with areas of organizing fibrosis. The differential
also includes a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (or other
antigen) or possibly eosinophilic pneumonia. Coexisting
infection is likely, although bronchiolitis seen on the previous
exam has improved.
2. New, bilateral pleural effusions. Mild smooth septal
thickening consistent with hydrostatic edema.
3. Lytic lesions within the right side of the T12 vertebral body
and left eighth rib. Pathologic fracture of the right clavicle.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia.
.
[**12-25**] cxr: IMPRESSION: No improvement in bilateral diffuse
opacities likely representing bilateral pneumonias
.
[**12-31**] cxr:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-14**] through 18:

Substantial progression of consolidation has continued relative
to [**12-26**] and 18 with greater involvement of the lower
lungs. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
The heart is normal size. Tip of the left PIC catheter projects
over the mid SVC. A 3.5 cm wide round opacity projecting over
the right hilus could be a fissural pleural fluid collection or
a growing lung abscess.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2031**] is a 62 year-old male with multiple myeloma status
post allo-BMT and donor lymphocyte infusion [**8-16**] with GVHD of
skin, who was admitted for dyspnea.
.
1) Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  The patient was admitted on [**11-26**] after
being evaluated in outpatient clinic. He noted he was feeling
increasingly SOB with exertion. He had a chest CT that showed
"worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with
ground glass "halos," and new ground glass wedge opacities in
the upper lobe" which were concerning for a progressive
infectious process, such as aspergillus. He was initially
started on vanco
