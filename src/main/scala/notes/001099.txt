Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2179-5-21**] Cardiac catheterization with intra aortic balloon pump
placement
[**2179-5-21**] Urgent Coronary artery bypass graft x3 (left internal
mammary artery > left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
> obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft > right coronary artery)



History of Present Illness:
67 year old male with known coronary artery disease s/p stents
to the RCA and OM in [**2172**], an active smoker, and GERD.  He
presented to his cardiologist's office for an episodic visit due
to exertional chest burning that started few days prior to
office visit.  His pain occurred with mowing his lawn or working
in his yard. He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for outpatient
catheterization that revealed significant left main disease with
active chest pain requiring IABP insertion.  Cardiac surgery was
consulted and he was taken to the operating room emergently from
the catheterization lab due to chest pain.

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 45%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  3.3 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity:  1.0 m/sec  <= 2.0 m/sec
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient:  4 mm Hg  < 20 mm Hg
Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly
depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

Conclusions
Prebypass
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of the inferior and
anteroseptal walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40- 45% %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylpephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Aorta is intact
post decannulation.

COMPARISON: Chest radiographs dating back to [**2179-5-21**], most
recent from
[**2179-5-23**].

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: New ill-defined opacities are
identified in
the lung bases, left greater than right, findings suggestive of
subsegmental
atelectasis. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The
upper lung
zones appear clear. There is no pneumothorax, vascular
congestion, or overt
pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
normal
limits. Median sternotomy wires are intact. On the lateral
projection, there
are small rounded lucencies in the inferior retrosternal region,
likely
residual post-operative air. The clicking sound on physical
examine may
actually be from mild crepitus due to residual air.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, probable
atelectasis.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Intact median sternotomy wires.
4. Retrosternal foci of air secondary to recent surgery.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**5-21**] Mr. [**Known lastname 64660**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac catheterization which
revealed muti-vessel disease including significant left main
stenosis.  He was having active chest pain during the procedure
so an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and he was brought
urgently to the operating room for a coronary artery bypass
grafting.  Please see the operative note for details.   He
received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics and was
transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative
manamgent.  That evening he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
Post operative day one his intra aortic balloon pump was removed
and he was started on betablockers and diuretics.  Later that
day he was transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility.  His chest tubes and
epicardial wires were removed per protocol.  He was started on
wellbutrin for smoking cessation and provide education, and
currently denied any urges to smoke.  He continued on inhalers
for pulmonary and mucinex was added to help with mucous
clearance.  On post operative day three he developed a sternal
click with no drainage, chest xray revealed wires intact.   He
was monitored and repeat Chest Xray [**5-26**] wires remained intact.
He was ready for discharge home on post operative day five with
services.
