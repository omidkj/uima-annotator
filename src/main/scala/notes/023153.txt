Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and Lower Extremity Edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
transesophageal echocardiogram
pulmonary function tests
cardiac catheterization and right heart cath


History of Present Illness:
57-yo-woman w/PMH S/F HTN, COPD presents from PCP's office with
1 month of increasing abdominal pain and distension and 2 weeks
of lower extremity edema. The patient present to her PCP who
drew labs, notable for elevated liver enzymes (ALT 665;AST 169).
A CT of the abdomen demonstrated ascites and the patient was
referred to GI. GI recommended an ECHO that showed severely
dilated RA, TR, EF 55% and mild pulmonary HTN. During the month
since intial presentation to her PCP she has gained
approximately 16 pounds. The patient denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness or palpitations. She notes
a history of many upper respiratory tract infections as a child,
a murmur since birth, and doctors [**First Name (Titles) 72677**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 15196**] fevers. The patient started lasix 2 days prior to
admsission. On the day of admission she was advised to see a
cardiologist at the [**Hospital **] hospital and was found to be in new
onset afib. She was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] for workup of these
issues.


In the ED her intial vitals were T:98 HR:85 BP:119/75 RR:18
SaO2:95%, she was treated w/ ASA 325mg, metoprolol 5 IV x2 with
little improvement in her HR which reportedly got as high as
130s (lowest documented systolic pressure was 88mmHg) and
Digoxin 0.25 IV. Further treatment w/ nodal agents was limited
by low blood pressure. She is now admitted to the CCU for
further care.

Surface ECHO [**2186-5-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-6**]
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic
[**Month/Year (2) 15196**] deformity. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.  There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: [**Month/Year (2) 15196**] mixed valvular heart disease (mild aortic
stenosis, mild mitral stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation,
and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation)
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY NON-INVASIVE VASCULAR STUDIES [**2186-5-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No DVT.
2. Right calf subcutaneous edema. Findings could represent
cellulitis in the appropriate clinical context.
.
CTA [**2186-5-3**]:
1. Small non-occlusive 7-mm pulmonary embolus in the left main
pulmonary artery, just proximal to its bifurcation into its
lobar branches. This embolus is unlikely to be hemodynamically
significant.
2. Severe right atrial enlargement with no definite thrombus
identified. Given the findings of right atrial enlargement and
pulmonary embolus, transesophageal echo is recommended to
exclude a right atrial (or ventricular) thrombus.
3. Evidence of right heart strain including reflux of contrast
into the hepatic veins and ascites, likely related to known
tricuspid regurgitation.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
5. Moderate-to-severe centrilobular emphysema worse at the lung
apices.
6. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. These lymph nodes are
likely reactive to the patient's emphysema.
.
Trans esophageal echocardiogram - [**2186-5-8**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). A definite thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage measuring 1 by 2 cm. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right
atrial appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular systolic function
appears grossly preserved. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows
mild [**Month/Day/Year 15196**] deformity. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis
(area ~1.7cm2). Mild to moderate([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac catheterization Left and right sidede - [**2186-5-9**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coornary angiography of this codominant system
revealed no
angiographically apparent obstructive coronary artery disease.
The LMCA,
LAD, LCX and RCA had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed pulmonary hypertension and
mitral
stenosis with a mean mitral valve gradient of 14 mmHg and an
estimated
mitral valve area of 1.0 cm2. There was no change in the mitral
valve
gradient with the administration of lopressor (slower heart
rates).
Markedly elevated left and right sided filling pressures with
PCWP of 36
and RA pressure of 19 mmHG with preserved cardiac index of 2.4
L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography revealed an EF of 50% with mild global
hypokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent obstructive coronary artery
disease.
2. Severe mitral  stenosis and moderate mitral regurgi
