stent placed. He was admitted today for left carotid stent
placement. After the carotid stent was placed he had transient
hypotension and chest pain post carotid stent with 4mm ST
depression. He required dopamine and neosynephrine and cardiac
catheterization showed left main disease. He had transient
confusion after hypotension and resumed to baseline. Chest pain
and EKG resolved with IABP. He was transferred to CVICU and is
being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath [**2136-6-21**]: 1. SEvere LMCA coronary artery disease. 2.
Hypotension and transient cardiogenic shock requiring pressor
support
and IABP placement. 3. Severe [**Doctor First Name 3098**] stenosis. 4. Moderate LCCA
stenosis with ulceration. 5. Successful PTA and stenting of [**Doctor First Name 3098**]
with embolic protection with 8.0x21mm Carotid wall stent. 6.
Successful direct stenting of LCCA with 10x31mm Carotid
wallstent. 7. Neurology consult given confusion at end of case.
8. CT surgery consultation for severe LMCA disease.
.
CT HEAD [**2136-6-21**]: 1. No acute intracranial process. If there is
high clinical concern for a stroke, MRI is the recommended test.
2. Small hypodense region in the right frontal lobe, new from
[**2132**], likely reflects sequelae of a prior infarction. 3. Chronic
small vessel ischemic disease.
.
Echo [**2136-6-25**]: Pre-Procedure: No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). with mild lateral
HK. There is normal free wall contractility. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Post-Procedure: The patient is A-Paced, on
no inotropes. Preserved biventricular systolic fxn,. Trace MR,
trace AI. Aorta intact. The tip of the SGC is at the PA
bifurcation.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7594**] is a 82 year old male with extensive history of
vascular disease presenting for elective carotid artery stenting
complicated by periprocedural hypotension and ischemic ECG
changes, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).  He was
weaned from the balloon pump was kept on nitro and heparin in
the CCU and  underwent CABG- see surgical course below.

# Coronary artery disease (CAD): He did retrospectively note
that he has been having anginal symptoms the past few weeks with
increasing frequency.  Had never had a cardiac cath before his
carotid procedure but when he became acutely hypotensive during
the procedure, his coronaries were looked at and they found
Diffuse disease: Not candidate for PCI given disease severity.
He had a severe (90%) proximal LAD lesion, most amenable to
CABG.  CT [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted for possible CABG and felt it was
appropriate with plan for CABG on [**2136-6-25**].  An IABP was placed
in the cath lab while hypotensive given the severity of his LAD
lesion so that they would try to augment coronary blood flow and
assist with decreasing oxygen demand in cardiac tissues.  This
was discontinued the following day.  Once his head CT was
negative for an intracranial hemorrhage, he was started on a
heparin drip for the LAD lesion.  On HD 2 he had chest pain and
T wave inversions on EKG so nitro drip was started and he became
chest pain free.  Rpt EKG showed normalization of inversions.
Also continued aspirin 325 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily,
and metoprolol 12.5 mg daily.  He was also continued on plavix
75 mg daily after loading with 600 mg in the lab for the carotid
stent.  He went for CABG on [**2136-6-25**] and transferred to the
cardiothoracic surgery service.

# Hypotension:  Was potentially vagally mediated given
manipulation of the carotid body during procedure as well as
groin sheath placement.  Additionally, was on nitro gtt before
the procedure due to blood pressure of 200s/100s upon
presentation from the [**Hospital3 **] facility.  When he became
hypotensive in the lab, he was started on pressors and the nitro
drip was discontinued.  He was weaned off pressors.  Of note, he
did take midodrine at home for baseline low blood pressures.  On
HD 2, hid IABP was removed and his pressures remained stable.

# Carotid stenosis: Principle reason for admission was for
elective carotid artery stenting.  This was performed in the
cath lab on [**2136-6-21**] and was successful.  Complications
immediately post-procedure as above.  He was also continued on
plavix 75 mg daily after loading with 600 mg in the lab for the
carotid stent.

# Aphasia, altered mental status: Originially after the carotid
procedure, patient arrived to the CCU with word finding
difficulty suggestive of Wernicke's aphasia with upper motor
neuron signs in the right lower extremity.  He underwent a CT
head which was negative for a bleeding stroke.  Neurology was
con
