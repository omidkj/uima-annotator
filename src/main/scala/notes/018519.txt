Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1491**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for SVT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic peritoneal fluid tap ~10cc


History of Present Illness:
59 yo M with MMP including cirrhosis of unclear etiology, Hep C,
CRF on HD, anemia, hypothyroidism transferred from OSH for SVT.
Patient was admitted to OSH on [**7-4**] with tachycardia admitted to
CCU with HR 160, narrow complex, CP [**6-22**], a/w SOB, O2 sats
88%-->97-98% on 2L NC. Patient converted with Adenosine 6 mg IV
x 1, HR decreased to 98-103. Patient then had a second episode
of SVT on [**7-8**], recieved Adenosine 6 mg then 12 mg and converted
again. Patient's BP remained 90-100s which is his baseline.
Patient then transferred for further management. Upon transfer
BP 98/47 HR 95 RR 15 O2 sat 96% 2L. Today patient also spiked a
temp to 102.3 treated with gent 80 mg iv x 1, vanco 1 gm x 1
then Ancef x 1.
.
He reports [**2-14**] lifetime episodes, each time a/w chest pressure
and shortness of breath, which started a few months ago while at
a rehab facility. His second episode was at dialysis. Patient
denies CP or pressure otherwise. He has shortness of breath a/w
COPD and abdominal distension and noticed increased LE edema
over the past few months requiring increasing doses of lasix and
prompting recent admission on [**6-10**] to same OSH.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient was stable with HR in 80-90s.
Denies any CP, cough, sob, sputum production, N/V, abdominal
pain or other complaints at this time.

IMAGING:
[**2105-7-10**] ABDOMINAL U/S:
IMPRESSION: Cirrhotic liver with moderate ascites and patent
forward portal venous flow. No hepatic masses on this limited
exam. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
.
[**2105-7-10**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). Tissue velocity imaging
demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (<12mmHg). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2105-7-10**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Borderline left axis deviation. Possible left
anterior fascicular block. No previous tracing available for
comparison
.
[**2105-7-13**] CXR PA&LAT:
Dialysis catheter remains in place with the distal lower tip
within the right atrium, unchanged. There is slight worsening of
opacity in the right lower lobe, particularly in the right
retrocardiac region, which has an adjacent linear component.
This may be due to either atelectasis or pneumonia. Small right
pleural effusion is also noted on the lateral view.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo M with cirrhosis of unclear etiology (?HepC), CRF on
HD, anemia, HepC, hypothyroidism, and SVT controlled with rate
control admitted for continued management of renal failure and
liver transplant evaluation.
.
# SVT:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] initially for continued management
of SVT. Patient had two episodes of SVT at OSH which both
converted with adenosine. Patient was stable with rate control
since conversion. He was maintained on Propanolol with good HR
control and no further episodes of SVT. His CE did not indicate
active ischemia. His ECHO also showed a normal EF, without any
wall motion abnormalities.
.
# CIRRHOSIS:
Unclear etiology of patient's liver cirrhosis. Patient
transferred here for further evaluation of cirrhosis and
management. Formal transplant evaluation was started while
patient was admitted. Hepatitis serologies were negative. Patent
portal flow noted on abdominal U/S. Pt had diagnositc tap which
did not show SBP. Pt was to complete liver transplant w/u as
outpatient. His diuretics were not resumed at time of discharge.
Pt had several episodes of hypotension requiring several boluses
of 250cc NS. His BP remained 90s without any symptoms. He was to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in 2 weeks and possibly resume
diuretics then.
.
# FEVER:
Patient had a Tmax of 102.3 at the OSH and had one episode of a
mild fever with chills and SOB. CXR demonstrated question of
right lower lobe infiltrate and patient was started on cefepime
and vancomycin to cover hospi
