IMAGING:
-----------------
CT TORSO [**3-26**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Post-surgical changes are
noted following a left upper lobectomy, with associated volume
loss of the left lung. Along the anterior margins of the suture
chains in the anterior mediastinum, there is a new heterogeneous
and necrotic mass measuring 3.6 cm x 3.6 cm. The mass directly
abuts the aortic arch, and lies immediately inferior to the
confluence of the left internal jugular and left subclavian
veins. Though there is a loss of fat plane, no frank invasion of
the adjacent vascular structures is identified.  Moderate
centrilobular emphysema is noted. Aside from bibasilar
atelectases, the lungs are clear without additional mass, or
consolidation. There is no pleural effusion.
Pericardial fluid is in the upper limits. Atherosclerotic
calcifications of the coronary arteries and aortic arch are
noted. There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar,
or axillary lymph nodes by CT size criteria. A small hypodensity
in the left lobe of the thyroid likely reflects a tiny nodule.
The esophagus is fluid filled and patulous, with a large hiatal
hernia noted.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple rounded
hypodensities in the
liver are predominantly too low to characterize, but likely
reflect cysts. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. Small
calcified gallstones are noted. The spleen and pancreas are
unremarkable. There is a 1.7-cm cyst in the upper pole of the
right kidney and a 7-mm cyst in the interpolar region of the
left kidney. The common bile duct is mildly dilated diffusely,
without evidence for a distal obstructing lesion, measuring up
to 10 mm. Small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is severe
colonic diverticulosis
without evidence for diverticulitis. There is no free air or
free fluid. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes by CT size criteria are identified.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta are noted.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is in
bladder, with air within the bladder likely related to
instrumentation. Prostatic
calcifications are noted. The rectum is unremarkable. There is
no pelvic
free fluid or adenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is
identified. There are multilevel degenerative changes, with a
dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. 3.5-cm necrotic mass along the suture margins of a left upper
lobectomy, concerning for local recurrence.
2. Mildly dilated common bile duct, without evidence for distal
obstructing lesion.
3. Severe colonic diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.
4. Emphysema.
5. Large hiatal hernia with a fluid-filled esophagus, placing
the patient at risk for aspiration.

MRI HEAD [**3-27**]:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post right craniotomy, with
resection of the enhancing right temporal mass. Curvilinear
enhancement of the medial aspect of the surgical bed persists
(17:12). At the most inferior aspect of the temporal lobe, there
is persistent nodular-shaped rim enhancement (17:8 and 6:18).
The amount of right hemispheric edema is unchanged. Mass effect
on the right lateral ventricle and effacement of the right
hemispheric sulci are unchanged. Leftward shift of midline
structures by 7 mm is unchanged. There is no uncal herniation.
There are expected blood products in the surgical cavity, with a
fluid level on the T2-weighted images. Expected pneumocephalus
overlies the right frontal lobe. There is no diffusion
restriction to indicate an acute infarct.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval right craniotomy with resection of the right
temporal mass.
2. Curvilinear enhancement of the medial surgical bed, and
persistent
enhancement of the inferior right temporal lobe. Attention to
these findings on followup studies is recommended.
3. Unchanged right hemispheric edema, mass effect in the right
lateral
ventricle, 7 mm leftward shift of midline structures and
effacement of the
right cerebral sulci.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 81M presented electively for right cranitomy for
mass resection. Operative course was uneventful, and
post-operatively was returned to the ICU. He remained there
overnight. In the morning of [**3-27**], he was transferred to the
neurosurgery stepdown unit. Prior to transfer he received
benadryl for contrast dye prophylaxis, and was somewhat
lethargic. Given this, he was put in the stepdown unit while the
medication metabolized. On [**3-28**] he had a 5min run of sustained
tachycardia(asymptomatic); EKG and cardiac enzymes were
done(benign in finding). He was then transferred to floor
status. PT and OT therapy saw and evaluated him and determined
that he would be an appropriate candidate for rehab. He was
discharged to an appropriate facility on [**3-28**].
