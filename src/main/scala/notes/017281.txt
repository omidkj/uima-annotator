History of Present Illness:
76M with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p cabg, afib, copd, dm2 presents from
rehab on the day after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on cardiac
[**Doctor First Name **] service. The patient underwent elective cabg/MVR by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-12**]. He had a complicated course developing sepsis on
[**5-19**] and found to have mesenteric ischemia requiring exploratory
laparotomy and right colectomy by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He also
developed a PNA and c.diff. He was discharged to [**Hospital1 9494**] on [**6-11**] with a plan to continue 7 days of vanc/CTX for PNA
and 10 days of flaygyl for c diff. At the rehab, the patient was
evaluated by a moonlighter who noted reddish output from g-tube
that was found to be guaiac+. The patient's wife was [**Name (NI) 653**]
regarding concern for an intestinal bleed and the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED the hct was found to be 33.9, up from 30.2 at
discharge on [**6-11**]. VS p 90 132/66 12 100% on vent. He was
evaluated by gen [**Doctor First Name **] and cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] in the ED in whose
assessment the patient, aside from the concern for bleeding,
appeared with similar clinical status to the point where he was
discharged to rehab.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-6-13**] 12:18 AM
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST: The extreme left costophrenic angle is
excluded from the radiograph. The tracheostomy tip terminates 5
cm above the carina. Median sternotomy wires and right central
venous catheter are unchanged in position. The heart size,
mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is interval
decrease in perihilar interstitial opacity consistent with
improving pulmonary venous pressure. Small bilateral pleural
effusions persist. Mild retrocardiac opacity likely reflects a
combination of atelectasis and effusion, although underlying
infectious process is not excluded.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving pulmonary interstitial edema.
2. Unchanged small pleural effusions and retrocardiac opacity
representing atelectasis or pneumonia.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-6-14**] 2:44 AM
SINGLE BEDSIDE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: Prominent
interstitial markings may represent chronic vascular congestion.
Overall, these are unchanged since multiple prior studies dating
back to [**2132-9-13**]. There is no obvious pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
normal. There are no focal consolidations. Triple lumen tunneled
dialysis catheter terminating in the mid SVC is noted.
Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged location.
IMPRESSION: Prominent bilateral interstitial markings may
represent chronic vascular congestion. No acute cardiopulmonary
process identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
# GI Bleed:
HCT on admission was stable from previous and remained stable.
G-tube was examined by medical and surgical teams and no
evidence of bleed was observed. The G-tube was changed. A PPI
was started for gastritis prevention. The patient should have
daily hematocrit checks.

# Respiratory failure:
The patient was at the rehab facility with a trach for vent
weaning. His vent settings were weaned to CPAP w/ & w/o PS with
pressure support level: 14 cm/h2o PEEP: 5 cm/h2o FIO2: 40 %.

# PNA:
Sputum grew MRSA and E. Coli. Plan was to continue
vanc/ceftriaxone for 7 days at discharge [**6-11**]. The patient
developed a fever and had an infiltrate on CXR.  He was switched
to vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam/metronidazole and will be
treated for a seven day course ending on [**2134-6-22**].

# Gastric Tube Placement:
The patient has his gastric tube replaced during this
hospitalization.  The location of the tube was confirmed
radiographically.  The patient had bleeding around the site of
his gastric tube, with no bleeding from within the G tube, the
day prior to discharge that resolved with pressure.

# Abdominal Wound:
The patient had a vacuum dressing applied by surgery.  The
dressing needs to be changed every four days.

# C. Diff infection:  The patient was continued on flagyl.
Given the extended duration of abx therapy he will need to
continue taking Flagyl though [**2134-7-2**].

# CAD/CABG:
No evidence of active ischemia. He was continued on [**Month/Day/Year **], BB,
statin.

# ESRD on HD:
Renal team aware, he was continued on HD by renal team. His HD
line was clotted for which he received TPA multiple times with
improvement in line function.

# Afib/ ?history of DVT
Now in sinus rhythm. He was continued on coumadin and BB for
rate control.  His coumadin was increased for subtherapeutic
INR.  He should have his INR checked on a daily basis and his
medications titrated appropriately.
