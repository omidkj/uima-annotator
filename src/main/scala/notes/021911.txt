Blood Culture [**2201-7-14**]: no growth

Pathology, [**2201-7-14**]: Leg, right, below knee amputation:
a) Gangrene.  b) Severe atherosclerosis. c) Resection margins
appear viable.

Upper endoscopy, [**2201-7-23**]:
Nodularity and atrophy of mucosa in the whole stomach (biopsy)
Multiple nodules were noted at the apex of the duodenal bulb
(biopsy)
No obvious source of GI bleeding was noted
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Colonoscopy, [**2201-7-23**]:
Large pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon - not removed
given recent GI bleed. (biopsy, injection)
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon
The IC valve appeared thickened and nodular. Dark stool was
noted upon intubation of terminal ileum.
Solid and liquid stool was found at several regions of the colon
precluding optimal visualization
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2201-7-13**] with left lower extremity
gangrene. He agreed to have an elective below-knee amputation.
Pre-operatively, he was consented. A CXR, EKG, labs, and type
and cross were obtained. He started a 14-day course of
vancomycin, ciprofloxicin, and metronidazole.

He was prepped, and brought to the operating room for surgery.
Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well. Please
see the operative report on [**2201-7-14**] for further details.

Post-operatively, he was extubated and transferred to the PACU
for further stabilization and monitoring. Due to persistent
hypotension with SBPs in the 70s, he was started on a levophed
drip and then transferred to the ICU for management while on
pressors. His diet was advanced. Once he was weaned from
levophed and maintaining a MAP above 60, he was transferred to
the VICU for further recovery.

While in the VICU he recieved monitored care. When stable his
arterial line was discontinued. PT followed the patient. He was
then transferred to floor status.

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. he received hemodialysis, per his outpatient
regimen, throughout his stay. His vancomycin was admiinstered
during HD. He was followed by physical therapy. He was restarted
on his home PO medications. He continued to make steady
progress.

On [**2201-7-20**], the patient was noted to have a dark, guiac positive
stool. He was changed to [**Hospital1 **] PPI, and his hematocrit was watched
closely. On [**2201-7-21**], his hematocrit had fallen from 28 (two days
prior) to 25.8.  A GI consult was obtained, and they recommended
upper and lower endoscopy, which was performed on [**2201-7-23**] after
achieving a bowel prep, revealing the aforementioned findings in
the "pertinent results" section. Biopsies were taken, which were
pending diagnosis at the time of discharge. No active bleeding
source was found. The patient is advised to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] gastroenterology as well as with his PCP for
further management of his GI nodules and polyp. For the
remainder of his hospitalization, the patient's hematocrit
remained fairly stable.  It is expected that it may drift
slightly and this is to be expected.

He was discharged on POD#10 to a rehabilitation facility in
stable condition, tolerating a regular diet and with good pain
control. He was advised to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] of
vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of gastroenterology, and his PCP.
