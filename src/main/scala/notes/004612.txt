Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
44 year old man with traumatic head injury; Right frontotemporal
contusion and right MCA stroke.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right frontal intracranial pressure monitor
PEG placed [**6-8**]


History of Present Illness:
44 year-old man with an unknown history transferred from
[**Hospital6 8283**] after traumatic head injury.  Pt was
working on his house when nailgun he was using misfired and hit
him in right supraorbital region, associated with loss of
consciousness. Per records, he was noted to be "thrashing" at
the
scene. Initial evaluation revealed a depressed skull fracture
with intracranial hemorrhages and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for
further management.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-5-11**] 12:18 AM
No significant change when compared to the prior study. There is
again noted a large area of infarct with brain edema causing
subfalcine herniation and shift of normally midline structures
to the left. The appearance of the cisterns appears unchanged
allowing for technical differences. However, due to the position
of the patient, cannot rule out uncal herniation.

Chest Radiograph [**2168-6-8**]: New patchy opacity within the right
mid lung medially, possibly representing atelectasis versus
consolidation within the right lower lobe. Stable bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST [**2168-6-6**].
Compared to the prior study of [**5-11**], the right middle
cerebral artery infarct now essentially involves the entire
cortex within this vascular territory, but relatively little of
the subjacent white matter. There is underlying dilatation of
the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], suggesting that this infarct is
subacute to chronic in age. There may be a small amount of
hemorrhage along the most deeply situated portion of this
infarct, which is within the right frontal lobe superior to the
bodies of the lateral ventricles. A probable subacute right
posterior cerebral artery infarct is seen within the right
occipital lobe, possibly with tiny amount of associated
hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is fairly extensive opacification of the frontal sinus,
more evident to the right side. The previously noted right-sided
superior orbital hemorrhage is seen with a jagged 1 cm area of
calcific density, probably representing residual orbital roof
fracture fragment. There is mild to moderate polypoid mucosal
thickening with slight frothy secretions superior to these
regions in both sphenoid air cells. There is slight thickening
of the posterior nasopharyngeal soft tissues near the left fossa
of Rosenmuller. This finding was not clearly demonstrably on
prior CT scans and deserves potential further evaluation by ENT
consultation.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION([**2168-6-7**])
EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, pureed consistency barium, one cookie coated with barium
and one barium pill were administered. Results follow:

ORAL PHASE:
The oral phase was noted for mild deficits primarily impacted by
cognitive deficits such that the pt required verbal cues to open
his mouth sufficiently to accept po solids. Additionally, oral
transit time was prolonged, there was piecemealing of both
solids
and liquids and mild loss of bolus control with premature
spillover of liquids to the intermittently to the valleculae and
less often to the pyriform sinuses.
Attempted the 13 mm barium tablet, however the pt chewed the
barium tablet, despite verbal cues and directions to the
contrary.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
The pharyngeal phase was judged to be wfl fora timely swallow
initiation with adequate velar elevation, hyolaryngeal
excursion,
laryngeal valve closure, epiglottic deflection and
pharyngoesophageal sphincter opening.
There was mild residue of the cookie bolus in the valleculae and
also in the pyriform sinuses. Residue in the pyriform sinuses
was
likely related to presence of the NG tube however. Additionally,
residue cleared with follow up sips of liquids.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
No aspiration or penetration occurred during the exam.

TREATMENT TECHNIQUES:
Alternating between bites and sips helped to clear pharyngeal
residue, as well as oral residue. Pt also required verbal cues,
especially with solids, to initiate oral transit, to chew, and
to
swallow.

SUMMARY:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39190**] presents with a mild oral dysphagia at this time.
The
pt's cognitive deficits are limiting his awareness with regards
to initiating the oral phase of swallowing such that the pt
requires consistent verbal cues to engage in the act of
eating/drinking. Therefore, longer term enteral
nutrition/hydration (PEG) tube is still recommended as it is not
likely that the pt will be able to meet his nutritional
requirements via po route alone. Pt is a good rehab candidate
and goal of weaning from tube feedings will appropriate during
rehab stay. Pt can also begin po diet consistency of regular
solids and thin liquids, but will require assistance and
supervision for all po's.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
     1.PO diet consistency of regular texture solids and thin
     liquids.
     2.PO meds as tolerated, may need to be crushed or placed
     via PEG tube.
     3.Follow up speech therapy at rehab re:weaning off tu
