Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-11-16**]:  Exlap, sigmoid colectomy w/ Hartmann's procedure
[**2103-11-23**]:  PICC placement
[**2103-11-23**]:  Diagnostic paracentesis
[**2103-11-28**]:  Transesophageal echocardiogram; Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
75F admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for multilobar pneumonia with
multiple previous admissions with similar comlaint and managed
on w/ ceftriaxone and flagyl now w/ worsening abdominal pain
since this am. The patient was originally admitted last week for
her pneumonia, at which point her only abdominal complaint was
diarrhea. She was empirically started on flagyl for this and
discharged on Friday, returning saturday with continued
fevers/chills. The patient had had persistent fevers and chills
and was planned for a CT A/P this am.

This morning the patient had acute onset severe abdominal pain,
worsening throughout the day. She has continued to have some
diarrhea. She had a previous lactate of 1.0, and has not had
significant recent weight loss. Her last colonoscopy was 3 years
ago with diverticulosis, but no other major findings.  The CT
scan obtained showed free air in the abdomen with a possible
perforation in the transverse colon.  She was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

IMAGING:
CT TORSO([**2103-11-16**]):
   CHEST: Comparison is made with the previous study done
[**2103-11-12**].  Left
     basilar atelectasis or consolidation and small pleural
effusions are
     again demonstrated.  Additional small patchy pulmonary
opacities are
     improved.  Enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes
are
     probably unchanged.  Some are difficult to assess due to
lack of
     intravenous contrast.  Widely scattered atherosclerotic
calcification
     including coronary artery calcification is again
demonstrated.
    ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:
There is interval development of free air with a moderate amount
of gas beneath the right hemidiaphragm and scattered small
pockets of gas
     in the mesentery.  The patient is status-post
cholecystectomy.  There
     is a small amount of ascites.  The colonic wall appears
thick although
     the colon is not distended which may account for this
finding.  There
     is no focal hepatic lesion.  The pancreas, adrenal glands
and
     left kidney are unremarkable.  The spleen is enlarged
measuring 16.2
     cm in long axis.  There is an inhomogeneous mass-like
density off of
     the posterior aspect of the right kidney.  This measures
approximately
     5.2 cm x 4.9 cm.  The right renal vein is enlarged.  There
are
     prominent retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes as
well as
     clearly enlarged left iliac lymph nodes.  Pelvic structures
are
     unremarkable.
There are degenerative changes in the spine.  The patient is
     status-post median sternotomy.  No suspicious osteolytic or
     osteoblastic lesion is identified.
   IMPRESSION:
     # PNEUMOPERITONEUM.  IN THE ABSENCE OF A HISTORY OF RECENT
SURGERY OR
     INVASIVE PROCEDURE, THIS SUGGESTS BOWEL PERFORATION.
CLINICAL
     CORRELATION IS RECOMMENDED.
     # THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME THICKENING OF THE COLONIC WALL
ALTHOUGH  THIS [**Month (only) **] BE DUE TO UNDERDISTENTION.  IS THERE CLINICAL
EVIDENCE FOR COLITIS ?
     # MILD ASCITES.
     # SPLENOMEGALY.
     # RIGHT RENAL MASS SUSPICIOUS FOR TUMOR.  ENLARGEMENT OF
THE RIGHT RENAL VEIN [**Month (only) **] BE DUE TO TUMOR THROMBUS.
     # RETROPERITONEAL AND LEFT ILIAC LYMPHADENOPATHY.  RIGHT
HILAR AND
     MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY.
     # SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.  BILATERAL SUBSEGMENTAL
ATELECTASIS AND
     POSSIBLE PULMONARY CONSOLIDATION CONSISTENT WITH PNEUMONIA.

Renal ultrasound ([**2103-11-16**]):
1. Right renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma with
tumor thrombus in the right renal vein and IVC as was seen on
the torso CT of [**Location (un) 620**] of [**2103-11-15**].
2. No hydronephrosis is seen bilaterally.
3. Limited Doppler examination due to the patient's body
habitus. There are abnormal bilateral arterial waveforms of
uncertain significance as there is absent antegrade flow in
diastole seen throughout. It is unclear whether this is due to
technical factors. Preserved gross arterial and venous flow is
seen within each kidney.

Bilateral lower extremity venous dopplers ([**2103-11-20**])- No DVT in
both lower extremities.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2103-11-21**]): The left atrium is
elongated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
(at least) mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Probably normal right
ventricular cavity size. Right ventricular function appears to
be preserved but is difficult to assess given poor acoustic
windows. Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global systolic funcction. Probable mass in IVC at 4.5
cm from junction with right atrium. At
