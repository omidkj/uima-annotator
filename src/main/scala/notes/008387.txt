Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trans esophageal echocardiogram
Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 49 yo M with PMH of HTN, ETOH abuse, asthma who
presented to OSH with 1 month history of DOE and palpitations.
Formerly active person but reports recently exercise limited to
SOB. Noted last night unable to walk upstairs due to SOB.
Patient was seen by PCP who noted him to be in rapid a-fib. He
was sent to OSH ED.

At the OSH, initial vitals were T97.4 hR 120-130s BP 120/79 RR
18-20 99% RA. There, patient had CTA that was negative for PE
but did reveal an enlarged heart. He received ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for concern of PNA. Pt was in afib with RVR (HR
120-130s). He received lopressor IV 5mg x 2, Digoxin 0.25mg x 1,
ASA 325mg, 1L NS. Given persistent rapid A fib, he was started
on diltiazem gtt which brought heart rate down to 110's prior to
transfer. His first set of cardiac enzymes was negative. He then
received lasix 40mg IV x 1 for presumed volume overload. Patient
admits to excessive drinking, approximately [**11-30**] drinks per day
with recent increase secondary to job stress.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo M with PMH of HTN presents with DOE and new onset atrial
fibrillation

# CAD: Pt had a normal ECHO in [**2139**]. EKG showed T wave inversion
and pt ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes.

# PUMP: Per OSH report and confirmed on [**Hospital1 18**] CXR, pt had
cardiomegaly. This was though to be due to either tachycardia
induced cardiomyopathy, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, viral
cardiomyopathy or alcohol induced cardiomyopathy. Other etiology
were ruled out including hemochromatosis (normal Iron and TIBC,
although Ferritin elevated), thyroid disease (normal TSH), HIV
and viral hepatitis. Pt responded well to IV lasix with improved
shortness of breath and oxygen requirement.

# RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation with RVR. Unclear if dilated
cardiomyopathy was the primary etiology with secondary afib, or
if chronic paroxysmal afib is the cause of the dilation. ECHO
did not reveal any structural abnormalities other than a reduced
ejection fraction, there was no evidence of pulmonary causes and
thyroid disease was ruled out.

Pt was initially rate controlled with a diltiazem drip, later
transitioned to rate control with beta blocker. Pt was initially
anticoagulated with heparin.

After TTE and TEE to rule out thrombus, pt underwent
cardioversion which was only transiently successful before the
rhythm reverted to atrial fibrillation. He was then started on
Amiodarone load and anticoagulation with Coumadin and Lovenox
drip.

# HTN: Pt was titrated up on lisinopril and metoprolol.

# Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology as pattern is neither
obstructive nor consistent with etoh, viral or ischemia. Pt
denied abdominal/RUQ tenderness. Hepatotoxic meds were avoided
and LFTs remained stably elevated.

# OSA: Pt evaluated by respiratory but did not tolerate CPAP. He
was counseled to follow up evaluation for OSA and CPAP as an
outpt.  He was noted to have confirmed periods of apnea and
desats to 80s on monitor with following episodes of tachypnea
and resolving sats.

# ETOH ABUSE: Pt did not show signs of withdrawl but was
maintained on a CIWA scale and prn Diazepam or Ativan.

# ANXIETY: Pt had multiple episodes of anxiety, intially thought
to be alcohol withdrawl but timeframe not consistent. He was
treated with low dose ativan with good effect.

Discharge Instructions:
You had trouble breathing before you were admitted and was found
to have a a weak heart. Your ejection fraction (a measure of
heart strength) is 28%. A normal ejection fraction is 55%. This
means that you have been diagnosed with Acute Systolic
Congestive Heart Failure. We started you on Toprol XL to slow
your heart rate and continued you on Lisinopril to decrease the
workload of the heart.
