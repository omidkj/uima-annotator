Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 71731**] was transferred from an OSH for splenic rupture
diagnosised by abdominal pain, hypotension, and CT scan at OSH.
She was brought straight to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and had a
splenectomy. Mrs. [**Known lastname 71731**] was hypotensive in OR which improved
with 1.5L crystalloid and 4 units PRBCs in OR(in addition to one
at [**Location (un) **]). For further details, please see operative note from
[**2190-4-18**]. Post-operatively she was transferred to the ICU without
complications.
  POD 1, the patient was successfully extubated. Her hematocrit
remained stable with appropriate urine output and pain control.
On POD1-2, the patient developed mild shortness of breath with
stable oxygen saturations. A chest x ray was obtained which
showed some mild volume overload. Based on clinical exam and her
history of bad COPD, her symptoms were most likely due to mild
volume overload and a COPD flare. The patient was transferred
briefly back to the ICU for monitoring. She was given 2 doses of
IV Lasix with appropriate urine out put and was started on a
Prednisone burst x 5 days. The patient responded quickly and was
able to be transferred back to the floor on POD 4.
   She was seen by OT/PT who recommended rehab which the patient
agreed to. Prior to discharge she was given all three vaccines
against encapsulated organisms. She will follow up on [**5-4**]
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to have her sutures removed.
