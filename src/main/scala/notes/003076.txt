Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis
Failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
69M with necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis complicated by
abdominal compartment syndrome, now transferred from OSH at
family's request for management. Patient was admitted at [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**2116-10-1**] to [**2116-11-24**] after transfer from OSH for cardiac
arrest in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. On arrival,
he was found to have abdominal compartment syndrome for which he
underwent decompressive laparotomy with significant improvement
in hemodynamics. During his stay, he had a prolonged ICU course
complicated by MSSA/Ecoli pneumonia, acute renal failure
requiring hemodialysis, and pseudomonas bacteremia, requiring
re-exploration with placement of [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy and
debridement of subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and fascia in the
suprapubic region and placement of a 16 French pigtail catheter
into a right complex air and fluid collection. Patient was
eventually weaned from the ventilator, extubated, weaned from
dialysis and discharged to rehab on [**2116-11-24**] (please see
discharge summary for details).

On [**2116-12-1**], patient was found in "pool of blood" by rehab nurse
and transferred to OSH for evaluation. On arrival, patient's Hct
was 15, he was febrile to 39, and hemodynamically unstable. He
was intubated and taken to OR for ex lap. Intraop, drainage of
multiple hemorrhagic abscess was performed with placement of 3
[**5-17**] inch triple lumen sump drains and a wound vac. He was taken
back to the OR twice for washouts and ultimately closed on [**12-10**].
He was initially broadly covered with vanc/ linezolid/ cipro/
zosyn/ fluc for pseudomonas pneumonia and UTI and VRE in
abdominal abscess. VRE became resistant to linezolid, and
patient completed 14 day course with tigecycline and all
antibiotics were stopped on [**2116-12-16**]. On [**12-21**], patient spiked a
fever and was restarted on vanc/zosyn, but eventually weaned to
zosyn alone
with ID recommendations. Due to his pneumonia, he required
prolonged intubation, ultimately requiring tracheostomy on
[**2116-12-24**], with exchange of trach on [**2116-12-25**].

Over the last week, he was having difficulty tolerating tube
feeds with episodes of witnessed aspiration, for which tube
feeds were stopped and TPN initiated. He has also had persistent
liquid stools which were cdiff toxin and pcr negative. Today,
patient's Hct dropped from 27 to 22, prompting a CT
abomen/pelvis. Due to poor progress over the last week,
patient's family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for second opinion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient well know for Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was transferred  to the
General Surgical Service from OSH. The patient was transferred
in ICU, blood, stool and urine cultures were sent, and IV Zosyn
was stared empirically. In ICU patient was started on Tube feed,
continued NPO, with Foley catheter and free H2o boluses for
hypernatremia. On HD # 3, he underwent replacement of his G-tube
to G/J-tube without any complications.
Neuro: The patient was stable from neurological standpoint, no
interventions were require. Pain was controlled with Morphine IV
prn.
CV: Sinus tachycardia in setting of SIRS, hemodynamically
normal. Patient was continued on IV metoprolol with good
respond.
Pulmonary: The patient was remained on 50% Trach mask with
stable O2 Sats. Pulmonary service and speech/swallow were
followed the patient. Chest PT and pulmonary toilet were
continued throughout hospitalization. Please see attached Speech
and Swallow consult for details.
GI: Patient's G-tube was changed to G/J tube on [**12-28**]. Tube feed
was restarted on [**12-29**] and advanced to goal. Patient was started
on tincture of opium and Creon for diarrhea. Diarrhea improved
and Creon was discontinued. Patient will require to continue
Speech and Swallow evaluations in Rehab.
Hypernatremia: The patient was hypernatremic on admission. He
was started on free water boluses and slow D5W IV. Serum sodium
improved to normal prior discharge.
GU: Foley was placed on admission to monitor urine output. After
Foley was d/cd, patient has condom catheter in place.
ID: Blood, urine and stool cultures were negative, IV Zosyn was
discontinued. Patient remained afebrile with WBC within normal
limits during hospitalization.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Hematology: The patient has an anemia of chronic disease. He was
transfused with 2 units of RBC for HCT = 22.8 on HD # 6. Please
continue to monitor HCT as outpatient.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a tube
feed, voiding, and pain was
