Service:  CARDIOLOGY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a
44-year-old man who presents for management of persistent
atrial fibrillation.  He was in his usual state of health
until Labor Day when he noted the acute onset of shortness of
breath accompanied by right upper quadrant abdominal pain
after walking several minutes.  He denied other associated
symptoms such as leg pain or swelling, cough, hemoptysis,
chest pain, or loss of consciousness.  He presented several
days later to the [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital where he was found
to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

He was begun on Coumadin, Amiodarone, and questionably a beta
blocker.  He continued to experience dyspnea on exertion,
occasionally associated with abdominal pain as well as
symptoms of PND, and orthopnea.  He denied lower extremity
edema or palpitations.

An echocardiogram performed on [**2133-9-15**] revealed
moderately enlarged left atrium and right atrium, and EF
low-normal, concentric LVH, and borderline global
hypokinesis.  PA pressure was 31.

He was evaluated at the SMH for ongoing abdominal pain with a
right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a thickened
gallbladder wall and the decision was made to proceed with
laparoscopic cholecystectomy as well as ventral herniorrhaphy
for repair of an incidental ventral hernia.

Coumadin was held a week prior to surgery on [**2133-10-15**].  An echocardiogram performed on [**2133-10-15**]
revealed concentric LVH with an EF of less than 10% with
severe global hypokinesis, small pleural effusion, 2+ TR,
moderately enlarged left atrium and right atrium and a PA
pressure of 31.

On [**2133-10-16**], he underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed no evidence of CAD.  On [**2133-10-16**], he
signed out of SMA secondary to dissatisfaction with medical
care there and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**].  At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he
was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, rate in the 120s, and was given Cardizem 10 mg
times two with resolution of his tachycardia to the 80s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy, ventral
herniorrhaphy [**2133-10-16**].
2.  Catheterization on [**2133-10-16**]:  No CAD; EF 15% with
severe global hypokinesis and left ventricular dilatation;
right atrium 15/19/13; RV 32/14/12; PA 30/10/21; PCW
24/31/25, questionable LV 108/13/15; cardiac output equals
6.6; CI equaled 2.5.
3.  Hepatitis, questionable A, questionable B, questionable
C, (per patient).
4.  Status post left lower extremity burn, status post skin
graft.
5.  Status post spinal fusion, questionably secondary to back
trauma.

disease.

EKG on admission irregularly/irregular with a rate of 118
with evidence of T wave inversions in I, V4-6, no prior EKG
available for comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As Mr. [**Known lastname **] had not been on warfarin
continuously for six weeks secondary to interruption of his
anticoagulation due to surgery, the decision was made to
perform a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out thrombus
followed by DC cardioversion.

The TE was performed and as there was no evidence of
thrombus, he was successfully DC cardioverted on [**2133-10-20**] and begun on heparin and Coumadin for anticoagulation.
He was felt to be fluid overloaded and diuresis was initiated
with IV furosemide.  After load reduction was initiated with
increase of his lisinopril from 10-20 mg.

On hospital day number three, an umbilical hematoma was noted
in the setting of a dropping hematocrit accompanied by
symptoms of severe abdominal pain.  CT with contrast revealed
a perisplenic and perihepatic fluid consistent with blood and
hematoma in the pouch of [**Location (un) **].  Heparin and warfarin were
held in the face of a 15 point drop in his hematocrit.  His
INR of 1.7 at the time was reversed with 1 unit of fresh
frozen plasma as well as vitamin K.

In the setting of his falling hematocrit, hypotension
(systolic blood pressures in the 60s), anuria, rising
creatinine (0.7-2.9 over 24 hours), the decision was made to
transfer him to the CCU for tailored therapy.  His
saturations at the time were in the high 80s on 3 liters.  He
was started on dopamine on the floor prior to transfer.

In the CCU, a Swan-Ganz catheter was floated revealing a
wedge of 8, CVP 4, cardiac index 3, SVR 494.  Dopamine was
continued in the unit and given his low SVR, Pitressin was
begun with a rise in SVR to 800.  Given his low SVR and white
count, there was concern for a septic picture and he was
begun on empiric antibiotics.  Post fluids, (total 3 liters
nasal saline plus IV), 3 units of packed red blood cells and
pressors, his cardiac output rose to 12, cardiac index 4.75,
wedge 12, CVP 10, and he was weaned off pressors on [**2133-10-24**].

In the unit, a central line was placed.  SVR was found to be
494 and in the setting of a white blood cell count of 12 and
expectoration of green mucus, he was pancultured and started
on empiric vancomycin consisting of vancomycin, levofloxacin,
and Flagyl.

In the unit, his central venous line was placed and CVP and
wedge revealed him to be dry.  Fluid boluses were begun and
he was transfused 3 units.  With volume resuscitation, his
renal function improved.  His creatinine dropped back down to
0.9.  His wedge and CVP rose as well as his cardiac output.
His white count dropped.

He was transferred back to the floor on hospital day number
five.  An echocardiogram was repeated on [**2133-10-26**]
which revealed an EF of 30% and a left atrial size of 5.6 and
given a rising hematocrit, the decision was made to begin
anticoagulation with warfarin.  He was begun on [**2133-10-27**] on 3 mg of warfarin (low-dose as he was on Flagyl).  His
hematocrit remained stable despite anticoagulation.  He was
discharged on hospital day nu
