[**2124-9-25**] EGD (prelim): No source of bleeding seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course ([**Date range (3) 75065**]):
* Gastrointestinal bleed:  With her dark stools suspect she has
an upper GI bleed. This has probably been going on for some time
as Hct already down from baseline on [**9-22**] ?????? though she had an
acute event the morning of admission. Broad DDX includes
gastritis, PUD, PEG trauma, dieulafoy etc. No known history of
varices, no vomiting to suggest [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]. A slow proximal
LGIB is possible also, but seems less likely.  No source of
bleeding noted on EGD [**2124-9-25**] and pt to have capsule endoscopy
as outpt. She was treated with IV protonix and had no further
bleeding episodes while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and remained hemodynamically
stable. Patient was transferred to the floor after her
hematocrit remained stable and her EGD negative for source of
bleeding.
.
* Anemia: Likely due to blood loss, with underlying anemia of
chronic disease. She has an impressive macrocytosis with
unremarkable folate, B12, TSH. Of note, her RBC morphology
report does describe both teardrop cells and schistocytes.
Patient received 2 units of packed red cells with appropriate
elevation in hematocrit.
.
* Atrial fibrillation:  Her home aspirin and verapamil were held
in the setting of bleeding. Her digoxin level was therapeutic.
.
* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Last seen by her outpatient
oncologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**9-22**].  Per OMR note, there is
evidence of clinical recurrence with increasing proptosis and
blindness, however radiographic stability to minor improvement.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] saw pt in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and had no new recommendations at
this time.
.
* Diabetes mellitus: Diet controlled at home but she was on a
sliding scale of insulin.
-----------------
On the floor, her blood counts remained stable. She was able to
work with physical therapy. She is planned for an outpatient
capsule study to evaluate the small bowel, which will be set up
as an outpatient.
