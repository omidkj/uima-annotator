performed and was negative, so she was put on prednisone
taper.

appetite, increased shortness of breath, nausea, and
vomiting.  Laboratory work included increased LFTs.  CT scan
torso yesterday revealed a large pericardial effusion from an

was transferred to the Medicine Service in good condition.
The patient's symptoms improved markedly with drainage of
pericardial effusion.  She remained in chronic asymptomatic
