Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2155-6-10**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
one
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had minimal disease.
The LAD was totally occluded at the origin.  The LCX had a
proximal 30%
stenosis.  The RCA had minor disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left-
and
right-sided filling pressures, with mean PCW pressure of 30 mmHg
and
mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary
hypertension, with mean PA pressure of 30 mmHg. There were
prominant v waves on the PCW tracing, consistent with possible
mitral regurgitation.  There was systemic hypotension, with SBP
of 85 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe left- and right-sided filling pressures.
3. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
4. Systemic hypotension.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2155-6-10**] at 7:40:13 PM
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of basal segments and near akinesis of the distal
2/3rds of the anterior septum and anterior walls and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (proximal LAD distribution). No
ventricular septal defect or pathologic flow identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
68yoM without any major cardiac history or other known medical
comorbidities presents with chest pain and found to have LAD
occlusion, s/p BMS with good results; also with elevated L and R
sided filling pressures and asymptomatic hypotension.
.
1. STEMI: Pt presented with minimal EKG changes (ST elevation in
V2-minimal in V3 that looked more like repolarization changes
and not true STE, however he had some elevation in aVL) however
with high clinical suspicion, was taken to cath lab where he was
found to have ostial occlusion of his LAD and he received BMS x1
to LAD. Minimal disease in rest of coronaries. He tolerated the
procedure well and did well post procedure. He was transferred
to CCU for further monitoring and was started on ASA, Plavix 75
[**Hospital1 **] x1 week then daily thereafter, Statin, ACEi, and long acting
beta blocker. A1c was 5.7% and lipid panel with total
cholesterol 200, LDL 138, HDL 43, Trigly 95. Appointments were
made for the pt to f/u. He was started on coumadin for apical
akinesis, will have his coumadin level followed by the [**Hospital 191**]
[**Hospital3 **] at discharge.
.
2. Elevated filling pressures: The pt was noted to have elevated
R and L sided filling pressure during catheterization and
prominent V waves concerning for MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] received a formal echo
on [**2155-6-12**] which showed he has systolic failure and akinesis of
the anterior wall from base to apex (which corresponds to his
LAD occlusion) however does not appear volume overloaded on exam
and did not start a diuretic regimen. He will need a repeat echo
in [**6-24**] weeks to further evaluate any recovery of his systolic
function. His medication regimen for heart failure is as above.
.
3. Hypotension: With evidence of elevated filling pressures and
depressed EF in setting of STEMI, likely due to heart failure.
His blood pressures were stable in the 90's through admission
and he was totally asymptomatic. ACEi and beta blockade for the
STEMI and heart failure were added cautiously.
