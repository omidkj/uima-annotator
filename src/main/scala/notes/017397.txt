Brief Hospital Course:
A 70 year old gentleman transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with a RP
hematoma, ARF and new onset CHF & atrial fibrillation.

1) Retroperitoneal Bleed/Hematoma:  The patient was transfused a
total of 3 units of PRBCs while in the MICU with an appropriate
increase in Hct.  No further transfusions were required.  Hct's
were checked every four hours.  The patient did not require
embolization to stabilize the bleeding.  Antihypertensives and
anticoagulants held.

2) Acute renal failure:  Most likely pre-renal azotemia from
blood loss and aggressive diuresis at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  Improved
with fluid and blood administration.

3) COPD:  Continued Spiriva & Atrovent prn.  Administered Flu
vaccine & Pneumovax. Recomended outpatient Pulmonary referal and
PFTs.

4) Atrial Fibrillation:  Likely related to atrial stretch. Echo
with dilated atrium. Unlikely ischemia given negative cardiac
enzymes. TSH normal and B1 pnd on discharge.  Cardiology
consulted, did not recommend cardioversion considering increased
risk of thrombosis following cardioversion and unable to
anticoagulate currently. CHADS score of 2. Warfarin was stopped
given bleeding. Would consider anticoagulation in the future.

5) Congestive heart failure: unclear etiology but likely
longstanding given atrial enlargement. Etiologies may include
HTN or even restrictive process in setting of EtOH use. Held
beta blockade while patient hemodynamically unstable. Discharged
on toprol XL with cardiology f/u. Discontinued CCB.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Retro peritoneal hematoma

Atrial Fibrilation


Discharge Condition:
Good


Discharge Instructions:
You were transfered from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with bleeding in the back
of your belly which was atributed to blood thining medications.
We gave you blood products to reverse the thinning properties of
your blood. Also at [**Location (un) 620**] you were noted to have congestive
heart failure and atrial fibrilation. We gave you medication to
help control heart rate (metoprolol). Excess fluid from was
removed your body with water pills. We are not prescribing any
water pills at this time as you did not have edema (swelling) of
your extremities when we examined you. Please discuss the need
for water pills with your regular doctor/cardiologist. It is
very important that you maintain a less than 2gm of salt diet
daily to prevent a reaccumulation of fluid. Please weigh
yourself daily and call your primary care physician if you gain
more than 3 pounds.
.
You should discuss with your regular doctor the need for blood
thining medication to prevent clots forming in your heart (in
the seting of atrial fibrilation). At this point we are not
giving you coumadin because of the risk for bleeding. You should
start taking aspirin 81mg daily for stroke prevention with
atrial fibrillation.
.
You need to follow up with a pulmonary doctor to have pulmonary
function tests and with a cardiologist in order to help
determine a long term medication regimen for you congestive
heart failure. You should continue the medications Toprol XL and
Enalapril to treat your heart failure. You should also discuss
referral to [**Hospital 3773**] Rehab with your primary care
physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] have been given a
