Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**4-30**] for 1 month history of
progressive confusion and lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of Parkinson's disease, CHF,
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, sent to ED per NH for one month
of progressive confusion and bilateral lower extremity edema.
Per discussion with his [**Hospital3 **] nurse (by admitting
team), he was A&O x 3 at baseline. However, over the past month
he has exhibited unusual behavior such as forgetting to wear
shoes, urinary incontinence and disorientation to location. He
had also had progressive lower extremity edema and scrotal edema
x 2 weeks prior to admission.

In ED, he was confused with head CT negative for acute process.
VSS; 97-100% 3L; CXR without evidence of failure but ? LLL
infiltrate and he received Levaquin 500 mg as well as vancomycin
x1 and tobramycin GTT for R purulent conjunctivitis.

From [**Date range (1) 61322**], the patient treated for presumed aspiration
pneumonia on the medicine servivce (though no fever or
leukocytosis). He had an episode of hypoxia on [**5-1**] with repeat
CXR revealing multifocal opacities and concern for mild CHF with
BNP 1467. The patient was diuresed from [**Date range (1) 59036**] ~ 1-2L. On
[**5-3**], AM hct 27 from 33 and later in the day, patient had
episode of melena with repeat HCT 24, INR 2.6. NG lavage did not
clear after 2L and given transient hypotension (systolic 80's)
and loss of access, the patient was transferred to the MICU
where he received 4U PRBC from [**Date range (1) 61323**].  The HCT stabilized at
28-29 x2 in MICU without further episodes of hypotension or
melena. He was transferred back to the medicine service in
stable condition for further management.

GI consulted, however given concern that patient would need
intubation for EGD, discussion with family led to decision by
family to decline EGD and support patient with blood products as
needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of Parkinson's disease, CHF,
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, sent to ED per NH for one month
of progressive confusion and bilateral lower extremity edema.
Noted to have severe right eye bacterial conjuntivitis with
keratitis and corneal ulceration as well as suspected aspiration
pneumonia. Hospital course was complicated by upper GI bleed (NG
lavage positive) in the setting of INR of 2.6, requiring brief
ICU care for central venous access and blood product support.
.
Upper GI Bleeding: The patient has baseline chronic anemia with
hematocrit in the low 30's. He was transferred to the MICU for
hematocrit drop to 24 due to upper GI bleeding with INR 2.6
confirmed by NG lavage. Central venous access was placed
temporarily for fluid and blood product support for hypotension.
GI service was consulted for possible interventions; however,
the patient's family declined EGD since the patient would likely
have required intubated for for the procedure. After tranfer
from the ICU back to the medicine service, the patient's
hematocrit remained stable around 30. Coumadin should be held
since the patient has further risk of bleeding and falls. He was
started on protonix that was switched to lansoprazole twice
daily due to difficulty swallowing whole tablets.
.
Dyspnea/CHF: At discharge, the patient was breathing comfortably
on room air with good oxygen saturation. He laced significant
lower extremity edema or crackles. He continued to have mild
scrotal edema.  His early course was complicated by an acute
hypoxic episode early in course, thought likely CHF or
aspiration pneumonia) with elevated BNP of 1467. This resolved
after diuresis. ECG was without changes.  His cardiac
medications were initially held. After the patient was improved
back to his baseline, he was started on low dose ACEI and BB for
CHF and rate control. Digoxin was held. Suspected aspiration
pneumonia was empirically treated with a course of levoquin and
the patient had been afebrile without leukocytosis several days
prior to discharge. Of note, CT Chest from [**2158**] showing left
lower lobe lung nodules, raising concern for malignancy and/or
post-obstructive process. Reportedly, these findings have been
stable for previous two years per [**Hospital1 2025**] PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**]. Further imaging
may be telling but of unclear benefit in this nearly [**Age over 90 **] year
old man.  Sputum culture grew rare corynebacterium diphtheroids
and blood culture was negative.
.
Confusion: The patient was thought to have unspecified dementia
(possibly secondary to Parkinson's) with acute illnesses where
he is oriented only to self and variably answers questions
appropriately. He is typically more confused in morning then
improves over the day. Head CT was without acute findings. Of
note, the patient has history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and
dementia (possible Parkinson's vs Alzheimers). It is possible
the patient may improve as his acute illness resolves.
Urinanalysis was normal. TSH was high; however, free T4 was
normal. He has follow-up arranged in the behavioral neurology
clinic for further assessment of dementia and management of
Parkinson's Disease.

Right Eye Infection: The patient had previously been diagnosed
with infection (and lacrimal ductal ob
