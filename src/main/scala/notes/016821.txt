Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2196-7-8**]
1. Mediastinal thymic fat pad biopsy.
2. Mitral valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic tissue

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84873**] is 63 yo female with a history of metastatic breat CA
on chemotherapy (Fulvestrant 500mg IM and a study drug). She
also has a history of mitral valve prolapse and 2+ MR based on
last echocardiogram. She presents with a few days of increasing
dyspnea on exertion. She notes progressive DOE limiting her
activities over 3-4 days, which started on Satuday when she was
walking a lot during her trip to [**State 531**]. She has noted an
occasional cough recently. She denies orthopnea or PND or chest
pain. She denies fevers, chills, n/v/d, hematuria, dysuria. She
denies peripheral edema. Her DOE has been progressive over the
past few days prompting her visit to the ED where her NT-proBNP
was noted to be elevated.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.4 99 107/67 98% 2L NC. EKG showed
SR HR 100. Q V1, V2. Lateral ST depressions. Inferior tWI.
Cardiology was consulted for evaluation of CHF. A bedside
cardiac ultrasound was performed with limited images that did
not show any obvious effusion or RV dysfunction. There was some
suggestion of apical LV dysfunction.

CXR showed nodular opacity in right lung field. Small bilateral
pleural effusions. CTA chest was performed but no prelim results
on arrival to floor. Patient received Levaquin, aspirin, and
20mg IV Lasix. 1st set of enzymes negative. Patient admitted to
floor for further workup of new onset volume overload.

rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2196-7-5**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe
primarily posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. The P1 and/or
P2 mitral leaflet scallop is flail. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of at least moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Tricuspid valve prolapse is present. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2196-5-26**], the posterior mitral leaflet is now flail, and
the mitral regurgitation is markedly increased (at least
moderate-to-severe, and likely frankly severe).

CTA [**7-4**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Stable left hilar lymphadenopathy with central necrosis.
3.  Mild congestive heart failure with new small to moderate
sized bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis.
4.  New 10 x 12 mm nodule within the right upper lobe concerning
for
metastasis.
5.  Worsening hepatic metastatic disease.

Cardiac cath [**7-6**]:
1. No angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic arterial normotension.

PFTs [**7-6**]: no pulmonary function abnormalities

Intra-op TEE [**2196-7-8**]
Conclusions
Prebypass:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe
P2 leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is partial P2 mitral
leaflet flail. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mitral valve. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is systolic flow reversal
in left upper pulmonary vein. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] distance is 2.9cm and the
A:P ratio is 1.03 as predictors for systolic anterior motion.
There is mild Tricuspid valve regurgitation with normal
appearing valves, the tricuspid annulus is 3cm. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**2196-7-8**] at 0830.

Postbypass:
There is a well seated, well functioining, bioprostetic in the
mitral position. Trace valvular mitral regurgitation is noted.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection. Left ventricular
function is grossly unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICINE COURSE:
This is a 63 yo F with h/o metastatic breast cancer and Mitral
valve prolapse who presents with progressive shortness of
breath.

# SOB: Echo shows new mitral leaflet flail, with markedly
increased mitral regurg. The etiology of her SOB was [**1-7**]
worsening mitral regurg with resultant volume overload/heart
failure. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out with CTA. PFTs wnl.
Cardiac surgery evaluated the patient and recommended mitral
valve surgery (open heart). Cardiac cath was preformed before
surgery and showed clean coronary arteries.

# Breast Ca: CTA showed increasing size of metastasis in the
liver. Oncology followed the patient while in house, and
requested a biopsy of a metastatic lesion during open heart
surgery given her radiographic disease progression. The
