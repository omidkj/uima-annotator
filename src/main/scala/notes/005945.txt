Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, pt was admitted with a cc of nausea and
vomiting to the medicine and GI service. Pt was fd to have ST
depression and subsequently underwent a cath which revealed 3
vd. Pt was awaiting surgical clearance by GI and had an EGD done
on [**6-6**] which revealed gastritis. Pt was then cleared for
surgery and on [**6-8**] pt was brought to the OR and underwent a
CABG. Pt tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
CSRU in stable condition being titrated on Neo and Propofol.
Please see op note for surgical details. Pt. remained intubated
overnight and on POD #1 was weaned from Propofol and mechanical
ventilation and extubated. Pt. was weaned off of NEO by POD #2
and was then transferred to the telemetry floor. Both diuretics
and b-blockers were started per protocol. Chest tubes,
epicardial pacing wires, Foley and JP in L leg were all removed
on POD #3. Pt. sustained a small r apical PTX as a result of
removing chest tubes. This resolved on it's own by the time of
discharge. Pt made a steady recovery with no other post-op
complications and slowly improved to level 5 by POD #7. PT saw
pt during entire post-operative period. [**Last Name (un) **] followed pt
throughout entire hospital stay and managed pt's diabetes. Pt
