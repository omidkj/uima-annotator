History of Present Illness:
51 male with HCV s/p orthotopic liver transplant in [**3-6**]
comlicated by HCV reinfection, was D/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-15**] after
placement of dophoff tube. He was feeling well the day of
discharge and had an uneventful evening; on DOA he had an

Brief Hospital Course:
A and P/ 51 M with HCV cirrhosis s/p liver transplant in [**3-6**],
CHF, DVT in [**4-4**], who presented with n/v x1 related to dophoff
tube and for further evaluation of a fluid collection in the
gallbladder fossa. The fluid collection was percutaneously
drained, with negative culture and showed resolution on
following CT scans of the abdomen.  Since he had very poor PO
intake and had lost enteral access, a feeding jejunostomy was
placed [**2148-10-26**].  Following that he developed a prolonged ileus,
partial obstruction around the J-tube, requiring re-operation.
Postoperative from the inital jejunostomy, his liver function
deteriorated, and he developed klebsiella sepsis.  Given the
overall poor prognosis, he was made CMO on POD22 and expired on
POD23.

NEURO:  Mr [**Known lastname 71430**] presented with a history of depression,
however, his mental status remained quite good until POD10 at
which time he was intubated for respiratory distress.  He was
sedated with propofol initially, however this was discontinued
due to hypotension.  He was initially alert and following
commands, but became increasingly encephalopathic with periods
of agitation.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  [**Name (NI) **] pt was hemodynamically stable inspite
of a history of CHF with an EF 35-40%.  On POD5 from his
jejunostomy, he became oliguric and tachycardic, requiring
multiple fluid boluses.  He was transferred to the ICU and a PA
catheter placed.  His cardiac index and filling pressures
responded to volume resuciation.  He became hypotensive after
his re-exploration and again responded to volume.  Lopresser was
restarted and mainted for hypertension and tachycardia after
this.

RESPIRATORY:  On POD5 from his j-tube placement, he required
intubation for increasing tachypnea and confusion in the setting
of renal failure and abdominal distention.  Chest radiographs
were consistent with CHF and sputum cultures sent after a
temperature spike grew multiresistant klebsiella.  His
oxygenation/ventilation remained stable.

Liver transplant: Pt was maintained on prednisone, cellcept, and
tacrolimus adjusted by level. He was continued on bactrim and
valgancyclovir for prophylaxis.
His interferon and ribavirin were also continued until the time
of J tube placement, at which time the interform was stopped.
Just prior to admission his HCV viral load was 21 million
copies, however, postoperatively this increased to greater than
70 million copies.  Given his complicated postoperative course,
and debilitated condition, hepatology did not think that he
would tolerate additional interferon therapy.  His liver
function deteriorated precipitously postoperaively, with
bilirubin increasing from 1.4 up to 40. He also become
coagulopathic and encephalopathic.  An introp liver biopsy
performed on [**2148-11-5**] showed findings consistent with recurrent
Hepatitis C, and bridging fibrosis.

Gallbladder fluid collection: Pt had a fluid collection on
recent U/S. On arrival, he had a repeat U/S that showed a
persistent fluid collection. A CT with IV contrast ordered
showing a fluid collection which was later drained by pigtail
cathater placement. The catheter drained 50 cc of serosanginous
fluid which was sterile (no organisms). Pt was placed on
levofloxacin and flagyl for a total 21 day course. He remained
afebrile without an elevated WBC count. The drain was removed a
week after placement, after confirmation of resolution of
collection via US, without complications.

GI: Pt did not want dophoff tube replaced. On HD 3, an NGT was
placed in presparation for a G tube placmeent, which was later
cancelled due to the fluid collection in the gallbladder and
anterior stomach. The tube was removed, and pt tried to eat on
his own. On calorie counts he ingested less tha 50% of his goals
and had persistent anorexia and nausea. The decision was made to
place an open J tube and he was taken to the operating room on
[**2148-10-26**].  The procedure was uncomplicated and he was stable
initially.  Tubefeedings were started on POD1 at 20cc/hour,
however, he was noted the following day to have increasing
hiccups, abdominal distention with small episodes of emesis.
Tubefeeds were stopped and the J-tube was placed to gravity.  He
had no flatus or bowel movements during this time.   A KUB
showed disteded loops of small bowel and a CT of the abdomen was
performed with contrast given via the J-tube.  This showed
findings consistent with a parial small bowel obstruction, and
postoperative changes.  He was observed for several days,
however he decompensated on POD4 and required transfer to the
ICU. His abdominal pain was improving, and his abdomen remained
soft.  After fluid resucitation, he stabilized and a CT of the
abdomen was performed the following day with oral contrast.
This showed contrast in the colon and collapsed small bowel
loops in the distal ileum.  After continued observation, his
urine output improved.  NGT output was initially high, then
tapered off however there was no flatus or bowel movements.  A
CT of the abdomen was repeated that did not show significant
change, however he had required intubation at this point and
became tachycardic.  Decision was made to return to the
operating room for exploration.  Please see the operative note
for full details.  There was a torsion around the j-tube
insertion site causing obstruction.  The j-tube was removed and
a liver biopsy performed.  He was returned to the ICU and
