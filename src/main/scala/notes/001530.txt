Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 yo woman with 3V CAD s/p MI and multiple
coronary interventions, DM2, HTN, dementia and a h/o DVT who
presents from her nursing home with hypoxemia.
.
She had reportedly had symptoms c/w an upper respiratory tract
infection for a week prior to desaturating to the high 70s on 2
LNC. Her O2 sat improved to the 90s with 5L by NC. At the time,
she was normotensive, but tachycardic to the 140s and tachypneic
to the 40s.
.
In the ED, her initial VSs were 99.8, 120, 73/58, 18, 97% 5LNC.
She spiked a temp to 101.4. A CXR was suggestive of pulmonary
edema and possible RLL pneumonia. Her blood pressure remained
low despite 1500 cc NS. She was given levofloxacin 750 mg PO x1,
vancomycin 1 g IV x1. A central line was inserted, and she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
The pt is mildly demented, and had a difficult time presenting
any further history. She reports rhinorrhea and sinus congestion
and does report a cough currently that is nonproductive. She
denies chest pain, difficulty breathing, changes in bowel
habits. She denies leg swelling or calf pain.
.
She received the influenze vaccine about 2 weeks ago, she
reports. She received the Pneumovax in [**8-9**].

STUDIES
Port CXR [**12-9**] - Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with a small
right effusion likely secondary to heart failure. More confluent
opacity in the right lung base may represent confluent edema
although underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Repeat
radiographs following diuresis recommended.

TTE [**12-10**] - EF 25%, The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild aneurysm of the basal inferior wall and
apex and near akinesis of the inferior wall, and distal half of
the anterior septum and anterior wall, apex and distal lateral
wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-9-2**],
the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall, apex,
and distal inferior wall dysfunction is new c/w interim ischemia
(mid-LAD distribution) with underlying multivessel CAD. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased LVEDP are
now identified.

Chest Xray [**2132-12-14**]- New left lower lobe infiltrate, reduction in
size of right effusion.

Port CXR [**12-15**] - This is compared with the prior from [**2132-12-14**].  The NG tube is in the proximal stomach.  There is minimal
interval change in the pleural effusions bilaterally.  The
pulmonary edema is somewhat improved.  There is interval removal
of the right subclavian line.
IMPRESSION:  NG tube in standard position.  Improvement in
pulmonary edema, effusion unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/Plan: 86 yo woman with 3V CAD, DM2, HTN, dementia
presents with respiratory distress, fever, SIRS likely [**1-3**]
pneumonia with course c/b pulmonary edema, and elevated cardiac
enzymes likely [**1-3**] demand ischemia.

1) Respiratory distress/hypoxia: Initially admitted withHad
episodes of transient desaturation, but appeared asymptomatic
overnight on the day of presentation. This was likely due to
pulmonary edema, CHF, and pneumonia. The patient was initially
treated broadly with vancomycin and zosyn which was changed to
vancomycin and levaquin, of which a 7 day course was completed.
The patient was ruled out for influenza and all blood cultures
were no growth. She was diuresed with IV lasix successfully with
improvement in her respiratory status. At the time of discharge,
the patient was sating 94-98% on 2 L NC and was no longer
tachypneic.

2) Systolic Heart failure/CAD - The patient was noted to have
new dysfunction of anterior septum and inferior wall as well as
new aneurysmal dilation, which was new compared to a prior TTE
from [**9-8**]. This was felt to be secondary to interval stent
closure. EKGs did show non-specific inverted T waves
precordially which were concnering for ongoing ischemia in the
setting of volume overload. Cardiac enzymes were checked and
were significant for troponin-T 0.42, CK 134, CK-MB 18, and MB
index 13.4. Cardiology was consulted who felt that her symptoms
of nausea, diaphoresis, and elevated cardiac enzymes were likely
due to demand ischemia rather than ACS. A heparin gtt was not
started to due unlikely ACS and the patient was not sent to the
cardiac cath lab as her enzymes began to trend down rapidly in
the setting of decreased symptoms and hemodynamic stability. She
was continued on aspirin, plavix, simvastatin, and metoprolol
and she was started on lisinopril, which was gradually titrated
up during the course of hospitalization.  She was discharged on
lisinopril 5mg po daily with goal of eventually uptitrating to
10mg daily.  In addition, she should be changed to long acting
beta-blocker such as toprol xl as soon as her volume status is
stabilized.  Her home dose of lasix 2
