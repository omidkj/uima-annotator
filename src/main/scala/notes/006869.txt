Admission Date:  [**2135-9-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2135-9-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2082-2-7**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old
Spanish-speaking gentleman with a history quadriparesis
following a cervical crush injury approximately 10 years ago,
history of tracheostomy at time of cervical crush injury,
history of decannulation of tracheostomy, history of
interstitial lung disease times 10 to 15 years of unknown
etiology, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was
transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2135-9-21**] to the
[**Hospital1 69**].

The patient was in a good state of health until approximately
10 years ago when he had a crush injury to his neck resulting
in quadriparesis.  At that time, he was working underneath a
motor vehicle when its support slipped.  This resulted in
quadriparesis with a prolonged hospital course, prolonged
ventilation dependence necessitating tracheostomy placement.
Shortly after his original injury, the patient's tracheostomy
was decannulated, and he was able to breathe independently.

In the intervening years, he had a history of multiple
recurrent pneumonias and bronchial infections.  He was
recently admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2135-9-11**]
with a chief complaint of neck pain and abdominal pain.  The
patient has a history of chronic constipation requiring Fleet
enemas every other day.  Secondary to his abdominal pain and
bloating, he is unable to tolerate his oral pain medication
for his chronic neck pain.

During that admission, he also developed bronchitis resulting
in a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  For the
bronchitis, he was started on clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and
prednisone.  A sputum sample from [**9-9**] also showed
yeast.

The patient was started on Diflucan.  On [**2135-9-12**],
the patient had an episode of respiratory distress while at
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital resulting in decreased oxygen saturations
on 3 liters nasal cannula oxygen to the low 80s.

He was transferred from the Medicine floor to the Intensive
Care Unit at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital where he was intubated for
hypercapnic respiratory failure.  Prior to intubation, the
patient's chronic opiate use was attempted to be reversed
with Narcan with only transient improvement in his
respiratory status.  Arterial blood gas at the time of
intubation was a pH of 7.27, PCO2 of 62, PO2 of 115, and
bicarbonate of 28.

During his Intensive Care Unit admission, he completed a
7-day course of ciprofloxacin and clindamycin.  However, at
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, the Intensive Care Unit staff felt it
difficult to wean the patient from the ventilator.  This was
felt to be multifactorial in nature secondary to the
patient's history of hypercapnia from chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare, neuromuscular weakness from his
underlying quadriparesis, as well as poor lung reserve from
his history of interstitial lung disease.  Therefore, he
underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube placement on [**2135-9-19**].

During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital,
the Pulmonary staff noted abnormalities on his chest x-rays
including bilateral pleural effusions.  A chest computed
tomography was performed at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with evidence
of pleural thickening and loculated pleural effusions
bilaterally.  Also noted was calcified lung parenchyma seen
in the apices with retraction consistent with chronic lung
disease.

In light of these abnormalities, the patient's case was
discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] (a thoracic surgeon a [**Hospital1 1444**]).  Therefore, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2135-9-21**] in order to undergo open lung biopsy.  The
end goal was to establish a diagnosis or etiology for his
interstitial lung disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Cervical spine injury at level C5; resulting in
quadriparesis approximately 10 years ago (status post
cervical crush injury).
 2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 3.  Interstitial lung disease times 10 to 15 years; etiology
never characterized.
 4.  Chronic pain; status post crush injury with intrathecal
pump containing morphine, baclofen, and clonidine.
 5.  Hypertension.
 6.  Gastritis.
 7.  Depression.
 8.  History of recurrent bronchial and pneumoniae
infections.
 9.  History of tracheostomy; status post initial cervical
spine injury.
10.  Sleep apnea (on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure at
night).
11.  Neurogenic bladder requiring suprapubic Foley.
12.  Chronic constipation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications prior to admission
included)
 1.  Elavil 75 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
