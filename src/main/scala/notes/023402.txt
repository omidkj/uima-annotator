Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement IVC filter

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67M with end stage jaw cancer receiving paliative chemo
therapy who was found by his wife at the bottom of his stairs.
She had last seem him 8-10 hrs earlier prior to her going to
sleep.  His clothes were strewn around the house (unusual for
him).  He was unresponsive and his G tube had been pulled out.
EMS  were called and he was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED via another
hospital as a truma basic.  His SBP when EMS found him was 80.
He was reportedly hypotensive upon arrival to the OSH. In the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED the pt's GSC was 3T with stable vital signs.  He had
severe facial swelling and was only postured to painful stimuli.

Head CT in the ED showed a Right frontal SAH, small hemorrhagic
contusions in the the posterior right temporal lobe. No
significant mass effect or intraventricular extension noted. No
CT evidence of acute cortical stroke. Possible nondisplaced
fracture over the left orbital roof. There was a nondepressed
left frontal bone fracture extending over the left orbit.
.
Patient was admitted to the trauma ICU.

RADIOLOGY

MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-8-5**] 5:13 PM

MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old man with fall subdural bleed
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Looking to r/o posterior stroke with MRA/MRI brain. Also would
like MRI brain w/ gadolinium r/o brain mets, hx of jaw ca
recurrence.
MRI AND MRA BRAIN

INDICATION: 67-year-old man with fall and subdural hematoma.
Rule out posterior stroke with MRI/MRA of the brain, rule out
brain metastasis with history of jaw carcinoma recurrence.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1-weighted images were obtained
following administration of [**Hospital 3173**] gadolinium. 3D
high-resolution time-of-flight sequence was performed. No
diffusion DWI or GRE sequences were performed.

COMPARISON: Head MR [**First Name (Titles) 27533**] [**2142-8-2**].

BRAIN MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] CONTRAST: Right subdural hematoma has
not appreciably changed in size since the previous examination.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood products are
not definitely appreciated on this study due to limited
examination. There is an area of enhancement involving cortex
and subcortical white matter of the right inferior temporal
lobe, corresponding to an area of contusion on the previous
examination. There is an area of surrounding edema.

There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles are normal in size.

BRAIN MRA: As on the previous study, there is absent flow in
most of the internal carotid artery, with a short segment flow
in the supraclinoid left internal carotid artery. There is
collateral or retrograde filling from the segment through the
anterior and posterior communicating arteries. The anterior
cerebral and middle cerebral arteries are patent. The vertebral,
basilar arteries are patent, with codominant vertebral arteries.
Major branches of the basilar artery are patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Absent flow in the major part of the left internal carotid
artery, with collateral or retrograde flow to a short
supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery.
Complete circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. Patent ECA, MCA, and PCA and major
branches. Diffusion-weighted imaging was not performed.
2. Area of enhancement in the right anterior temporal lobe,
corresponding to an area of contusion seen on previous
examination with surrounding edema. This finding may reflect a
post-traumatic etiology; however, underlying enhancing brain
lesion cannot be entirely excluded. Short-term two-week followup
is recommended to document resolution of this finding.
3. Unchanged right subdural hematoma.
4. Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage not evaluated on
this study, as gradient echo imaging was not performed.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 5:30pm on
[**2142-8-6**].

This study was reviewed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2142-8-7**] 11:08 AM

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT [**Month/Day/Year **] CONTRAST: The scan is of
limited diagnostic quality due to artifact from breathing during
the examination. Within these limitations, there are new
bibasilar effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases. There has
been improvement in
