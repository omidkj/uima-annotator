Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, found down by niece

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yr/o F with Hx HTN, DM, osteoporosis, and breast CA (post
[**Doctor First Name **]/chemo) who still lives alone despite dementia and baseline
mental status that is A & O x 1 who was found stuck between her
bed and a desk at home today by niece (presumably there up to
24hrs). She was conscious with no obvious trauma and had
absolutely no complaints.  Her niece brought her to ED for
evaluation where head CT and cervical CT showed no acute
findings on prelim read. Initial EKG showed ST elevations
anteriouly and inferiorly and troponin was 1.34 with CK of 7711
despite lack of sx. Pt was given ASA and started on a heparin
gtt. Cards consult was obtained and after discussions with
family decided not to pursue intervention but proceed with
medical management. Pt was admitted to CCU for monitoring.
.
Of note, has recent history of progressive cognitive decline on
top of chronic dementia and is roughly A&O x 1 at baseline.
Family has been trying to keep her at home because another
elderly family member did poorly when placed in a facility and
because Ms [**Known lastname 9907**] herself gets very confused and disoriented
when not at home.

Other Urine Counts
CastHy: 7 Mucous: Occ
Urine culture ([**2120-7-18**]): no growth

CT C-Spine ([**7-18**]): Moderate multi-level DJD. No acute fracture
or mal-alignment. Right apical lung scarring.
CT Head ([**7-18**]): Left parieto-occipital subgaleal hematoma. No
acute intracranial injury.
CXR ([**7-18**]): COPD. Biapical pleural thickening. No acute
cardiopulmonary
process.

TTE ([**2120-7-18**]): Mild symmetric left ventricle with normal cavity
size and regional left ventricular dysfunction with
hypokinesis/near-akinesis and ballooning of the apical segments
consistent with left ventricular apical aneurysm. No left
ventricular mass/thrombus appreciated. Above findings consistent
with possible Takotsubo cardiomyopathy vs. mid to distal
occlusion of a wrap-around left anterior descending coronary
artery.

CXR ([**2120-7-22**]):  Lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of COPD
changes. Since
[**2120-7-18**], bilateral mild pleural effusions are new. Diffuse
interstitial
thickening seen in prior radiographs is no different. Note is
made of
bilateral apical pleural thickening. There is no lung
consolidation.
Cardiomegaly is mild.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
[**Age over 90 **]yoF with h/o dementia presents after being found down for up
to 24hrs, and incidentally found to have ST-elevations in
anterior leads with elevated cardiac enzymes.
.
Active Issues:
# ST elevations: Admission EKG showed ST elevations in leads II,
AVF, V2-V6.  Initially concerning for possible STEMI
(wrap-around LAD), however history more c/w Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy given setting of acute stress. Family opted for
medical management instead of cardiac cath given her age,
cognitive decline, and goals of care. She remained asymptomatic.
TTE showed apical akinesis with low-normal EF (40-45%).  She
received heparin gtt for 48 hours.  Her ASA dose was increased
to 162 mg daily.  Atorvastatin was initially held due to c/f
rhabdomyolysis but was restarted on HD#3.  Her home atenolol was
switched to metoprolol in the setting of renal failure.  After
her renal function improved, she was started lisinopril 10mg
daily.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis: Pt's history of fall with prolonged down time,
disproportionate CK elevation compared to CKMB, and urine
dipstick with large blood but few RBCs all suggestive of
rhabdomyolysis [**12-27**] fall.  She was given continuous IVFs for
renal protection, and her creatinine improved to 0.9 (mildly
elevated at 1.2 on admission).  Her atorvastatin was initially
held but restarted on HD#3.
.
# UTI: UA on HD#3 c/f UTI. She was empirically started on IV
ceftriaxone and her culture sensitivies showed that ceftriaxone
was a good antibiotic choice for this e.coli infection. She was
treated with a 3 day course of ceftriaxone. She remained
afebrile with a normal WBC count following antibiotic therapy.
.
# Dementia:  patient was found to be aggitated during the
evening on hospital day 4.  In speaking to the family the
patient was not normally aggitated, but had some baseline
cognitive impairment at home.  She was given 5 mg Zyprexa PO x2
and 0.5 mg Haldol IM in addition to her nightly 12.5 mg of
seroquel.  She had improvement in her aggitation without further
interention. A geriatrics consult was requested and they
suggested that we increase her night time dose of Seroquel to
25mg. This was continued during this hosptial course.
.
# Transaminitis: Mild LFT elevation on admission, likely
secondary to a skeletal muscular source rather than hepatic.
Enzymes were trended and had improved by time of discharge.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC 15
