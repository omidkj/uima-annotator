Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
several month history of intermittent changes in mental status
(odd affect, word finding problems, delayed verbal responses
progressing to unresponsiveness and - perhaps - right sided
weakness).
carotid stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-5-3**] Left internal carotid artery stent


History of Present Illness:
62 y/o female known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for PVD now admitted
with multi-lobar pneumonia, NSTEMI and AMS.  During workup for
episodic AMS issues during hospitalization, she received duplex
of carotid arteries showing 80-99% stenosis of the left internal
carotid artery, then confirmed by CTA. On retrospect, the
patient does not recall ever having any motor or sensory
deficits that would indicate a prior CVA or TIA.  She does
relate a very short burst of garbled words that occurred approx
2-3mos ago.  No other episodes of aphasia or dysphagia.



Past Medical History:
1) IDDM - Has had diabetes for 20 years. Checks fingersticks QAM
and sometimes QPM. Fingersticks generally in 100s. No problems
with hypoglycemia.
2) HTN - Baseline SBP generally 150-160 before dialysis, 130
after dialysis.
3) Anemia [**2-22**] chronic kidney disease
4) ESRD, on hemodialysis
5) Arthritis in her knees
6) Hyperlipidemia
7) COPD
8) Left Posterior tibial angioplasty [**2151**]
9) C-section [**2142**]
10) Cholecystectomy [**2132**]

Social History:
Immigrant from Barbados. Former hospital employee. 1 child, 18

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Date range (1) 109294**]/10 On Medical Service
Altered Mental Status:  Patient was working with nursing and
after standing from the comode and standing from the bedside
chair she was noted to have a "glazed" look on her face, become
slow to respond, and improve with lying flat, though not to her
full baseline.  An EKG was checked, electrolytes were checked,
cardiac enzymes were checked, a CXR was checked and a blood gas
was drawn.  EKG was unchanged from prior, electrolytes were
notable for a bicarb of 35, CE were not elevated, and CXR was
unchanged.  ABG was 7.47 PCO2 51 and pO2 78.  The patient had
positive orthostatics.  Our conclusion was that the patient was
dry between being run negative in dialysis and having had
diarrhea all day yesterday.  However as this continued to recurr
we became suspicious for other pathologies.  Doppler of the
carotids was undertaken revealing an 80-99% stenosis of the left
carotid leading ot vascular consult and below hospital course.
.
PNEUMONIA: The shortness of breath, cough, elevated white count
with left shift and RUL infiltrate on chest film are consistent
with pneumonia. Given her history of dialysis, she meets the
definition for a healthcare acquired infection. Agree with
antibiotic choices in MICU as patient is clinically improving.
ID ok'd vancomycin today
- attempt sputum culture
- f/u blood cultures
- continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin plan 7-10d
course
- supportive treatment of cough
- Duonebs
.
NSTEMI: Patient ruled in with Cardiac enzymes, cards was
consulted in the unit and was briefly placed on heparin.  Noting
that she is pain free this likely demand ischemia.  Her MB
fraction remains low and stable, and its hard to interpret her
CK and Troponins in the setting of her renal faillure.  Cards
was following and was consulted last night and stated that there
would be no benefit to cathing uless the patient is either a)
having a STEMI or b) having chest pain as cathing for angina or
demand ischemia has only a symptomatic benefit without a
survival benefit. We will cycle her enzymes again for full rule
out, though this mornings event was highly unlikely to be
cardiac.
- monitor on telemetry
- continue aspirin
- continue statin
- continue beta blocker
- finish rule out
.
ESRD: Patient with ESRD on hemodialysis on
Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule currently being evaluated for
renal transplant. Patient with electrolytes at baseline.
.
PVD: aspirin and plavix were continued
.
DM:
- We continued home insulin regimen with ISS
.
HYPERTENSION:
- We continued labetalol, amlodipine, lisinopril
.
