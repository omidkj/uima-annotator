Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year-old woman with a history of COPD (4.5L
baseline O2 req), HTN, CHF, pulmonary HTN, morbid obesity.  She
was discharged yesterday following a hospitalization for
hypotension that was thought to be due to overdiuresis.  Today
she was found to be hypoxic at her nursing facility, with oxygen
saturations of 75% on room air and 81% on 5 liters.  She was
brought by ambulance to the ED.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were T 99.1, HR 85, BP 113/80, RR
24, Sat 94% 10 L on a non-rebreather.  She subjectively felt
well, but had a worsening cough.  She denied any fever, chills,
diaphoresis, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea.  She has had no change in her baseline leg swelling.
She received albuterol and ipratroprium bromide for her COPD and
furosemide for her CHF.  She was found to have a UTI and was
started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  A prior urine culture
grew K. pneumoniae resistant to bactrim and nitrofurantoin.  Her
oxygen saturations fell repeatedly, although the patient was in
no distress, and she was started on BiPAP.  With a PEEP of 8 and
FiO2 of 0.35 she had a pH of 7.34, pO2 of 58, and a pCO2 of 51.
Her BNP was elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 37571**], similar to a prior level on [**8-11**]
of [**Numeric Identifier 88894**].

TTE w Bubble Study [**2113-9-7**]
A stretched patent foramen ovale/secundum type atrial septal
defect is present. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial
pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Stretched PFO/secundum atrial septal defect present.
Severely dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle accompanied by
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension consistent with primary pulmonary
process (COPD, pulmonary embolus, etc.)
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-28**], a
stretched PFO/secundum atrial septal defect is now appreciated
with the injection of intraveous contrast. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension has increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
77-year old female PMHx COPD, CHF, and severe pulmonary HTN who
presented with worsening hypoxia, found to have intracardiac
shunt, not responsing to aggressive medical therapy, expiring
with family at bedside.
.
# Severe Pulmonary Hypertension / Intracardiac Shunt - Patient
with a baseline oxygen requirement of [**5-1**].5LNC, thought to be
secondary to chronic diastolic heart failure, obstructive and
central sleep apnea, with resulting severe pulmonary
hypertension, who presented with hypoxia similar to that present
at prior discharge, thought to be secondary to progression of
above conditions.  No new acute lung processes were identified
to account for hypoxia, raising suspicion for intracardiac
shunt.  TTE w bubble study demonstrated a large shunt (likely
ASD).  Patient was treated w sildenafil and digoxin without
improvement, although she remained asymptomatic.  Patient's
hypoxia progressed and she was no longer able to tolerate Bipap,
requiring nonrebreather mask to maintain sats >80%.
Norepinephrine drip was started to aid in diuresis, without
improvement in symptoms.  On day 18 of hospitalization, patient
hypoxia continued to worsen with new onset dyspnea, fatigue.
Family meeting (final of many) was held, and at patient request,
patient was made comfort measures only, and patient expired with
family at bedside.
