Brief Hospital Course:
Pt initially seen at [**Hospital1 1474**] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. Here
she received a repeat Head and C spine CT which had no obvious
injury. CT of her face and XRs of her TLS spine showed no
injury. The pt was agitated and required intubation for a MRI to
evaluate for [**Doctor First Name **] and diffuse low density lesion seen on CT. The
pt remained altered after extubation and also had low grade
temperature. She was seen by neurology, who felt the MRI was
normal and did not feel the this was the source of the pt's AMS.
They initially attributed this to oversedation with profofol,
haldol and ativan.

Pt was also evaluated by psychiatry, who recommended stopping
her psychiatric meds. These were stopped and the pt's MS
improved gradually until she approached baseline per her family
and friends. She met with social work and discussed the
specifics of her accident and the reason why her child was in
the car at the time. Psychiatry also saw her and felt this did
not represent a suicide attempt. There was a possibility that
the patient may have had a substance abuse problem. Psychiatry
[**Name (NI) 653**] her outpatient therapist and discussed this issue. The
patient demanded to leave on her final hospital day. This was
discussed with psychiatry who felt the pt was competent to make
this decision. She was informed of the risks of leaving and
elected to do so against medical advice. She was encouraged to
return with any concerns and to follow up with psychiatry and
social work.

During her hospital course the pt also had low grade fevers and
rales on exam. Her sputum showed evidence of moraxella and
staph. Also, her facial CT showed sinsusitis. Therefore, the pt
was placed on levofloxacin, which was continued throughout her
hospital course.
