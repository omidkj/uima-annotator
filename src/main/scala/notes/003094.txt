Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the MICU, where he was tachypneic and
wheezing on presentation.  He was initially treated with
continuous albuterol nebs and IV steroids, with gradual
improvement. ABG on [**1-26**] showed 197/42/7.35/42 while on
continuous nebulizer treatments.  He remained afebrile but in
light of productive cough was started empirically on therapy for
a community-acquired pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. He was noted to AG of undetermined etiology upon
presentation, which had resolved by HD3.  IV steroids were
changed to PO prednisone.  On the morning of [**1-27**], he had a peak
flow of 500 and was transferred out of the ICU to the Medical
[**Hospital1 **] team.  Steroid course was planned for a two-week taper.
Ceftriaxone was switched to oral Cefpodoxime with plan to
complete a 7-day course of cephalosporin and a 5-day course of
azithromycin.

Medical floor course:
.
55 y/o gentleman with Asthma and Hepatitis C cirrhosis presented
to the ED with asthma exacerbation, initially admitted to MICU
now transferred with improved respiratory status.
.
# Asthma Exacerbation.  Patient was much improved by [**2194-1-27**] with
PF in 550s and no subjective senation of dyspnea. Based on
further interview, it appears that exacerbation was triggered by
known culprit exposures (auto exhaust, cigarrette smoke, spices)
and possible URI. It was felt that exacerbation was unlikely due
to CAP, given no fever, clear sputum and no opacities on CXR.
No sputum data was available.  Patient was discontinued from
cefpodoxime and completed course of Azithromycin. Pt. also had
PE findings consistent with allergic rhinitis.  He was continued
on albuterol nebs Q2H prn, ipratropium nebs q6h, prednisone
60mg.  With this treatment he continued to improve with PF of
650 on [**2194-1-28**].  Based on this response, he was discharged home
with a 2wk prednisone taper, continued on Advair and singulair.
Given findings consistent with allergic rhinitis, patient was
started on loratadine at discharged and instructed to resume
flonase after completion of PO prednisone.  He was also provided
with clotrimazole troches tid prn for hx of oral candidiasis
with previous prednisone treatments.  He was also treated with
HISS for high dose steroids with FS ranging 106 - 175.  Patient
was also referred to [**Hospital 9039**] clinic to further assess for asthma
triggers.
.
# Hep C cirrhosis: nonresponder to prior treatment as per last
Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] note. No stigmata of chronic liver disease on exam,
but last RUQ u/s consistent with cirrhosis.  Not an active issue
during this admission. Patient is to followup with D
