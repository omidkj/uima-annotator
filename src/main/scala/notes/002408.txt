Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73 y.o. male with a h/o COPD (6-7LO2 at home) and CHF, presents
after losing consciousness while moving from his wheelchair into
a car. Mr [**Known lastname **] noticed that his oxygen tank was empty while
in a parking garage. He does not know how long it had been
empty. He attempted to begin to start another tank, but lost
consciousness before he was succesful. He reports no prodrome:
he only comments that he noticed his oxygen was gone and then
passed out. His wife states that a concerned samaritan then
helped drag her husband out of the car onto the ground. He
apparently had a pulse and was breathing. Together, they
restarted his oxygen. She reports that he was probably
non-responsive for ~5min. She thinks he was mostly motionless
but one of his arms might have been shaking. After the episode,
he was brielfy "groggy", but was coherent, and was brought to
the ED.
.
His baseline COPD is 6L O2 at rest, 7L with exertion; he is
fatigued after walking ten feet. He has had no recent change in
his exertional capacity and has not noticed an increase in his
baseline cough. He has been producing clear phelgm. At baseline,
he has orthopnea and PND, requiring him to sleep with his bed
elevated and two pillows. He has a h/o of Afib with a pacemaker
placed in 6/[**2192**]. He has no other h/o of cardiac disease. He has
no h/o of seizures or prior syncope.
.
He denies bowel or bladder incontinence. He has not had recent
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased PO intake. He has not
noticed increased edema. He denies chest pain, palpitations,
pleurisy, fever, chills, and sweats.
.
In the ED, he was somnolent but repsonisive. He was given
Furosemide (40mg IV), Methylprednisone (125mg IV), and started
on Nebulizers (Ipratropium, Albuterol). He initially had a
non-rebreather with 100%O2. proBNP returned at 15,123 (baseline
not known). Initial ABG was 7.33/46/68. WBC was increased to
15.0. On weaning to 6L NC, his O2 sat decreased to 81-82%

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] lives with his wife in a private one-story home in
[**Location (un) 5450**], NH. He had left an eye appointment at [**Hospital3 **]
Associates before his LOC. He did not receive any medication at
that appointment, except for having his pupils dilated.
He has ~100 pack-year history and has not smoked in 20 years. He
denies EtOH and recreational drug use.  Last ETOH 32 years ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Pneumonia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was placed back on oxygen as
described once admitted to the ICU, though he required more
oxygen than was his baseline. Postulated to be secondary to
pneumonia, likely aspiration given patient's leukocytosis,
initial CXR consistent with LLL pneumonia (although it is hard
to interpret in the setting of prior lung surgery).  During his
stay, he had increased sputum production, but remained afebrile.
 With presumed pneumonia in the setting of syncope, the
possibilty of aspiration was considered, and for this reason, he
was started on levofloxacin 500 mg po daily and flagyl 500 mg po
TID for a 7 day course, all of which were completed in the [**Hospital1 18**]
MICU.
.
2. COPD: Albuterol and atrovent nebs were continued, patient was
placed on prednisone taper, tapered to 20 mg prednisone daily
with plans for a 30 day course (started on [**2192-9-2**]). In
evaluating other causes for Mr. [**Known lastname 62449**] increased oxygen
reqirement, pulmonary embolism was considered and ruled out by
CT angiogram as well as a negative lower extremity ultrasound.
On discharge, he required 6L of O2 via NC (which is his
baseline), as well as 12 L face-tent.  He is able to transition
from bed to chair and feels that his dyspnea is at baseline
despite some increased oxygen need. The patient desires to be
closer to his home in NH, and in discussion with case
management, it was felt that he needed to be transferred to an
acute rehabilitation facility that could accommodate his
increased oxygen requirement.  Apparently, the patieny has also
been bridging to hospice care over the last month and is in
actively on the path to transitioning to hospice care.
.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: Given syncope in the setting of known
CHF and dyspnea, an echocardiogram was obtained which showed
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There was
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation was seen. There was also severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension (60-80 mmHg).
.
4. CHF: LVEF on Echo >55%, though patient has known CHF. During
his ICU stay, he had several episodes of acute shortness of
breath with lung crackles that responded well to lasix. Cardiac
enzymes were negative and EKG has been unchanged. Isordil was
started to improve congestion. Lisinopril was also started. He
will also continue on lasix.
.
5. ARF: Pt's creatinine was initially 1.9 on admission trended
down to 1.2 on discharge with diuresis.
.
6. Atrial fibrillation/increased INR: Patient on coumadin for
atrial fibrillation, though coumadin doses have been gradually
decreased and then held due to patient's rising INR. This is
postulated to be due to the fact that patient has been taking
levofloxacin for pneumonia. INR on day of discharge was 2.1, and
coumadin was restarted 1 day prior to discharge at 2 mg daily.
