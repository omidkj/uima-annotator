Service:  MICU GREEN

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] is a 73-year-old female
with adenocarcinoma of the lung several times status post
multiple wedge resections and a right upper lobectomy on
[**2173-4-29**].  She also has a history of significant chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  She is brought into the
Emergency Department here at [**Hospital3 **] by EMT after
experiencing three hours of shortness of breath on the day of
admission.

As previously mentioned, Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a wedge resection
of the posterior segment of her right upper lobe on [**2162**] for
first instance of adenocarcinoma of the lung which was T1,
N0, M0.  She then [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] excision of two nodules in the
left lung in [**2166**] followed by chemotherapy for another
adenocarcinoma of the lung, and finally she had a
recurrence/new incidence of adenocarcinoma in the lung in the
right upper lobe which was T2, N0, M0 treated with right
upper lobectomy on [**2173-4-29**] at [**Hospital6 2910**].
This tumor was 3-4 cm in diameter.  All nodes were negative.

Patient's postoperative course was notable for heavy
secretions which she had difficulty expectorating, requiring
frequent suctioning and bronchoscopy several times with
intubation 4x during these bronchoscopies.  The patient was
discharged on [**5-27**] and was stable until the day of
admission, where she is noted to be confused by her family
and having increasing shortness of breath with coarse breath
sounds.  911 was called and the patient was found alert and
oriented times three, but with O2 saturations on 5 liters
(which was her discharge oxygen requirement) of 56%.

She was brought to the Emergency Department, where the
patient had progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure
culminating in a intubation followed by hypotension which
required wide open IV fluids and double pressors.  The
patient was subsequently brought to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further treatment.

ambulates with a walker since her discharge from [**Hospital6 2911**].  She has extensive tobacco history, but no alcohol
or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, the patient had the
following physical exam:  Her temperature is 97.0, heart rate
is 95 and regular, blood pressure was 143/78 on dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine.  She was on assist control 18/500, 100% FIO2,
her PEEP was 10, her peak pressure is 33, plateau pressure is
24, and she was sating roughly 94%.  In general, she is an
elderly female intubated and sedated.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal and reactive to light, anicteric.  Neck was supple.
There was bounding bilateral carotid upstrokes, no bruits, no
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds,
regular, rate, and rhythm, prominent pulsation at the right
upper sternal border.  There was a S4, there were no murmurs
or rubs.  Lungs:  She had decreased breath sounds at the left
lower lobe, although is moving okay air.  Abdomen:  Abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses, no
hepatosplenomegaly, and normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:
1+ pitting edema all four extremities, multiple ecchymoses on
all four extremities with faint macular rash on thighs.  She
had a laceration roughly 8 cm in the left forehand.  The left
hand was dusky, and her fingers were cool to touch.
Neurologically, she was moving both feet with normal tone.

The day of discharge, the patient's physical examination was
as follows:  Her temperature is 98.8, heart rate was 81 and
regular, blood pressure is 129/61.  She was sating 96%.  She
was on pressure support of 10 and 5, tidal volume 400,
respiratory rate of 20, and FIO2 is 40%.  She was supine.
She appeared depressed the day of discharge.  She was still
anicteric.  Neck is supple.  Heart is regular, rate, and
rhythm.  Lungs showed inspiratory wheezes bilaterally,
rhonchi in the right lower lobe.  Abdomen is soft with mild
tenderness to palpation around the PEG site.  Her extremities
were 3+ edema in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper
extremities.  She had multiple ecchymoses.  The laceration on
the left forearm was dressed and her trache site was clean,
dry, and intact.

LABORATORIES:  Laboratory data on admission, the patient had
the following laboratories:  White count is 10.3, hematocrit
30.0, platelets 448, and MCV of 85.  She had 88% polys, 1
band, 7% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes.  Her Chem-7 was as
follows:  Sodium 141, potassium 5.4, chloride 100, bicarb 32.
BUN 19, creatinine 0.6, glucose 170, calcium 9.2, magnesium
1.9, phosphorus 5.0.  Her coags were 13.1, 27.1 with an INR
of 1.1.  Her lactate level was 1.0.

She had a chest x-ray which showed cardiomegaly, pleural
thickening with volume loss in the right, patchy density in
the lower up and mid right lower lobe.  She had sutures in
the left mid lung.  She had a loculated right pleural
effusion versus infiltrate.  She had left lower lung
collapse, small nodular density in the left apex, healed
posterior rib fractures on the left.

Sputum from the outside hospital on [**4-30**]:  Her bronch had
grown [**Female First Name (un) 564**].  Bronch on the 12th had grown out
Acinetobacter baumannii pansensitive.  On the 15th, she had
gram-negative rods and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans, and on the 17th, she
had gram-negative rods.

Her culture data here at [**Hospital3 **] was all negative
including multiple blood cultures and urine cultures.  Her
sputum did grow out 4+ gram-positive cocci in pairs, but no
predominance of a pathogen.

Electrocardiogram initially showed 58 beats per minute
accelerated junctional rhythm, normal axis and normal
intervals, but the P-R was not clearly seen and there was a
question of whether there was AV beat association.

The patient had CT scan of the chest which showed a right
hydropneumothorax at the upper lobe on the right, right lower
lobe fibrosis, consolidation, small right effusion, and a
left sided bullae with minimal effusion.

Patient also had an echocardiogram which demonstrated the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, left ventricular ejection fraction of greater
than 55%, RV was dilated, there was a right ventricular
pressure overload into her pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

The day of discharge the patient had the following laboratory
values:  Her white count is 16.8, roughly 93% polys and 5%
lymphocytes, hematocrit 33.0.  Chem-7:  140 of sodium,
potassium 3, chloride 99, bicarb 31, BUN 28, creatinine 0.3,
glucose 122.  Calcium 8.2, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 4.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary:  The patient came in with hypercapnic
respiratory failure.  It was felt that the likely etiology of
the respiratory was as follows:  She has extremely poor
underlying lung disease with minimal lung reserve.  Given the
multiple resections of her lungs and severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and bullous disease.  It was
felt that she had copious secretions again.  On her discharge
from [**Hospital6 **], lately had some mucus plugging and
then had respiratory fatigue whic
