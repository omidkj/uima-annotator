HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
male with history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure with
biventricular failure, ejection fraction of 20-30% on
hemodialysis for volume overload/end-stage renal disease, who
was found [**1-1**] in nursing home unresponsive, pulseless,
apneic.  CPR was initiated.  Airway was opened and revealed
copious emesis in the oropharynx which was suctioned,
respiratory rate 1-2, rhythm PEA at a rate of 25-50.  Pacing
was initiated at 70 beats per minute.  Patient was intubated
in the field.

In the Emergency Department, patient was still in
PEA/asystole, received neophedrine 2 mg, atropine 4 mg,
arterial blood gas, intubated revealed 7.24 pH, pCO2 47, pO2
77 on assist control rate 20, tidal volume 600, PEEP 5.0,
FIO2 100%.  The patient had SBP in the 60s.  Was started on
Dopamine.  SBP raised to 140, however, baseline was in the
80s.  Laboratories revealed a potassium of 6.9, he was given
insulin calcium.  Repeat potassium was 6.4.
Electrocardiogram revealed peaked T waves.  Dopamine was
stopped with SBP in the 120s, then propofol was initiated for
sedation, for ventilation, and the SBP went down to 70, and
dopamine was restarted.

The patient developed frequent [**Last Name (LF) 105738**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dopamine was
discontinued, and NEO was started with resolution of ectopy.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

MICU course notable for patient vented, neophedrine
continued, hemodialysis was performed for hyperkalemia felt
most likely due to tissue necrosis from primary
cardiovascular event versus tachyarrhythmia from elevated K.
The patient was initially unresponsive with dilated fixed
eyes, but mental status cleared and patient was back to
baseline.  Vent was weaned, and the patient was extubated.
The patient was started on Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
Flagyl to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia and line
infection given elevated white blood cell count.  Abdomen was
distended and tense, but at baseline, so no studies were
pursued.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2115**], right ventricular infarct post coronary artery
rupture.
2. Congestive heart failure.  Dilated cardiomyopathy causing
biventricular failure.  Echocardiogram [**9-26**]:  Ejection
fraction 20-30% left ventricular, 1+ AR, 3+ MR, 3+ TR.
3. Ascites secondary to right heart failure requiring
ultrasound guided paracentesis, liver biopsy [**2119-4-26**]
within normal limits.
4. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, left lower extremity
thrombus status post below the knee amputation after
gangrene.
5. Gout.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. History of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
8. Hemodialysis q Monday, Wednesday, Friday for volume
overload and beginning in [**2119-11-26**].

ALLERGIES:  Heparin causing HIT and codeine.

5. Amiodarone 200 q day.
6. Protonix 40 q day.
7. Zoloft 100 q day.
8. Colace 100 [**Hospital1 **].
9. Actigall 300 tid.
10. Tums tid.
11. Dulcolax prn.
12. Guaifenesin prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Resident of [**Hospital3 2558**] with daughter and
son.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On [**2120-1-4**] on transfer to floor:
Vital signs:  96.1, systolic blood pressure 80, heart rate
66, 18 respiratory rate, 98% in 2 liters.  Lying in bed,
cheerful, occasionally coughing, breathing without discomfort
in no acute distress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Oropharynx is clear without exudate.  Neck is supple, no
lymphadenopathy, jugular venous distention 7 cm.  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally anteriorly except for crackles on
left anteriorly.  Regular, rate, and rhythm, [**2-29**] murmur at
apex to axilla, distended, and nontender, normoactive bowel
sounds, bilateral below the knee amputation, no ulceration,
2+ edema bilaterally.  Alert and oriented times three.
Nonfocal.  Grossly dry with peeling skin diffusely, palmar
erythema, fluctuance.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  On [**1-1**] white blood cells 21.7,
hematocrit 38.0, platelets 257, INR 1.5.  Sodium 140,
potassium 6.9, chloride 98, BUN 78, creatinine 8.4, glucose
345, lactate 4.8.  D dimer 1,000-2,000, FDP 10-40, fibrinogen
238.  Troponin less than 0.3 x3.

CHEST X-RAY:  Slight decreased subcutaneous emphysema, slight
increase on the left, retrocardiac density on the left versus
pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 67-year-old male with coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, severe
congestive heart failure, ascites, hemodialysis for volume
overload, who presents after greater than 30 minutes PEA
arrest likely secondary to hyperkalemia requiring intubation
now status post extubation with miraculous neurologic
recovery.

1. Cardiovascular system:  Pump, dilated cardiomyopathy with
ejection fraction of 20-30% with 3+ MR, 3+ TR.  Hemodialysis
for volume overload, not on beta blocker.  Ace because of low
blood pressure, continue to monitor.

Coronary artery disease on aspirin:  Does not appear to be
status post acute myocardial infarction.  Elevated CK MB and
normal troponin most likely secondary to CPR, however, known
coronary artery disease, systolic blood pressures 80-90 at
baseline.

Rate and rhythm:  Bradic, stable.

2. Pulmonary:  Extubated [**2120-1-2**] doing well on room air,
subcutaneous emphysema resolving, significant right rib pain
from CPR, given Toradol and Tylenol as needed.

3. Renal:  The patient is status post hemodialysis, has an
elevated phosphorus, calcium acetate added.  Continue
hemodialysis.

4. ID:  White blood cell resolving on Vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl, presumed femoral line infection,
however, line was cultured and showed no growth to date, so
Vancomycin stopped.  Chest x-ray showed possible infiltrate,
so patient was continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl for 10
day course for aspiration pneumonia.

5. Neurologic:  Mental status cleared significantly, still
with increase in confusion from baseline was continued on
Zoloft for home regimen and was not given narcotics for pain
to minimize confusion.

6. Gastrointestinal:  Ascites secondary to congestive heart
failure has required paracentesis in the past, but is in no
pain, so this was not pursued.

7. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Taking a po diet.
Electrolytes within normal limits after hemodialysis.

8. Heme:  Hematocrit stable.

9. Code Status:  After conversation with wife, it was decided
to make the patient DNR/DNI.  The patient was discharged back
to [**Hospital3 2558**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Hyperkalemia.
2. Cardiopulmonary arrest resolved.
3. Aspiration pneumonia.
