Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
SOBX 3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83yo M with history of NSTEMI in [**2198**] complicated by rapid AF
and CHF (followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], and chronic aspiration thought
[**2-5**] progressive neurologic disease which he has had for 20years
(followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] and on nebs TID at home plus 2L O2 at
night at home for unclear reasons p/w respiratory distress x 3
days. Per the patient's wife the patient has had progressively
worsening SOB over the last few days so that now even at rest he
is SOB.  He has also had increased weakness and fatigue,
including difficulty with walking which happens when he becomes
ill.  His wife notes reduced secretions and increased
congestion.  This has not been associated with CP, palps, PND,
orthopnea, or fevers however he has had a cough.
.
On admission to ED triggered for respiratory extremis. Etomidate
nebulizer made sats come up to 98% on 2-4L NC O2.
On physical exam patient's admission vitals: T:96.8 HR:69
BP:122/109 RR:28 O2Sat:92%. Noted to be tachypneic, somnolent
but able to respond when questioned. Lungs with wheezing and
crackles. Dry MM and cachectic. EKG: NSR, NA, 1AVB (old), no
STE. Labs notable for lactate 2.1. PCXR - no fluid overload on
ED's read despite crackles in lungs. Covered broadly with Vanco
1gm and Levofloxacin 750mg. Also received 2 combivent nebs and
325mg ASA.
.
Initially trops and BNP delayed on [**Hospital Ward Name **] because machine
broken, however then BNP came back elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 3301**] range (same
as prior admission during NSTEMI) and trop 0.86 with CKMB 23, CK
291. When these labs came back ED consulted cardiology who did
not call back. They also started a hep gtt for both NSTEMI as
well as presumed PE given hypoxia, clear CXR and elevated
cardiac markers without ST/TW changes on ECG.  PE was ruled out
with CTA.  Vital signs on transfer were 98.2  97  128/64  32
100% NRB.
.
On arrival to the floor patient c/o respiratory distress but
denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or
lower extremity edema.

.
CXR: Low lung volumes but clear fields. No acute intrathoracic
process.
.
CTA:
1. No Pulmonary Embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Evaluation of lungs limited by respiratory motion, though no
focal
consolidation or pneumothorax. There is minimal bibasilar
atelectasis.
3. Stable appearance of small hiatal hernia s/p fundoplication.
.
ECG: NSR at 85, Normal axis, normalization of anterolateral T
wave inversions noted on prior dated [**2199-8-23**].  No Q waves.  No
ST changes.  TW flattening V1-V4, similar to prior.
.
ECHO [**2200-1-7**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly to moderately depressed with mid to apical hypokinesis
(LVEF= ?40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2198-2-9**], left ventricular sysotlic function is
probably similar to slightly better but views are suboptimal for
comparison.
.
VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY:
INDICATION: Dysphagia.
FINDINGS: A video oropharyngeal swallow study was conducted in
conjunction
with the speech language pathologist. Various consistencies of
barium were
administered to the patient under intermittent fluoroscopic
imaging. The
patient aspirated a large volume of thin liquids. There was
significant
premature spillover of material during the oral phase of swallow
for other
consistencies.
IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids. Please refer to the
official speech
language pathology report in OMR for complete details of the
findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
83yo M with h/o NSTEMI, AF with RVR, CHF (EF 40%) admitted to
CCU with hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
#. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initially thought to be
secondary to both acute decompensated heart failure in the
setting of an NSTEMI and mucus plugging seocndary to chronic
aspiration.  Patient diuresed well to IV Lasix on the first day
of admission and CXR showed no signs of an aspiration pneumomia.
 He continued to have episodes of witnessed aspiration events
after becoming euvolemic, see below.  He was not given any more
doses of lasix throughout his admission.
.
#. Aspiration: Patient has chronic aspiration and dysphagia
secondary to neurologic disease.  He continued to have several
episodes of hypoxia assocated with aspiration events.  He was
kept NPO.  A speech and swallow evaluation showed that he is at
high chronic risk for aspiration, especially thin liquids.  He
was cleared for thick, nectar liquids.  After a meeting with
him, his wife, and his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was determined
that a feeding tube would not be desirable and care initiatives
were transitioned to CMO (see below).  Patient does still
require frequent sunctioning at the time of discharge, however,
is eating whatever he wishes.
.
#. NSTEMI/CHF: Patient with elevated troponin in setting of
normal creatinine (although likely decreased GFR given age and
degree of cachexia) as well as elevated CK and CKMB. ECG notable
for prior infact, though no acute change.  Patient was
asymptomatic.  Decision was made for medical management, and
patient was placed on aspirin, continued on a beta blocker, and
a heparin drip for 48 hours. He was initial
