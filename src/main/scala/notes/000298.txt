Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A

History of Present Illness:
75 yo M hx CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin, and
recent hospitalization for SIRS [**2189-11-20**] - [**2189-11-30**] without
obvious source of sepsis presenting from [**Hospital6 **] with
severe chest pain. He said that this chest pain started 8pm last
night, right-sided, non-pleuritic, continuous, sharp, [**7-6**]. He
was initially brought to [**Hospital6 33**] with SOB and
hypotension to 70/50 with CXR showing pneumonia. He was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 96 90 124/70 19 100% NRB (which was
weaned down to 97% NC 2-3L. His chest pain had resolved by the
time of arrival, and pressure initially in the low 100s before
decreasing to the 80s. He was started on vancomycin and zosyn,
RIJ placed and started on low dose levophed. He received 2L
fluid.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD (cath in [**2161**] showed 3-vessel disease, patient states he
had MI [**09**] years ago), presented last hospitalization with NSTEMI
believed to be secondary to demand
2) Atrial fibrillation (not on coumadin given h/o GI bleeding)
3) [**Company 1543**] Kappa KDR701 dual-chamber placement
4) Cirrhosis (classified as cryptogenic although patient has
history of heavy EtOH use 35 years ago)
5) Chronic kidney disease with baseline Cr 2.7
6) Angiodysplasia of stomach and small intestine with serial
endoscopic cauterization ([**2186**])
7) GI bleeding chronic anemia (multifactorial, thought to be [**12-29**]

kidney disease + GI bleeding)
8) Prior TIA ([**4-3**], ? [**8-5**])
9) Melanoma, right forearm
10) Multiple BCCs
11) Diverticulosis
12) Colon polyps
13) Left carotid stenosis with stent ([**2184**])
14) BPH ([**3-4**])
15) Gout
16) Pneumonia ([**12-3**])
17) Portal gastropathy
18) Low grade esophageal varices
19) Remote appendectomy


Social History:
Lives independently across the street from his daughter. Smoked
1.5 packs/day x 15 years, quit 35 years ago. Former heavy EtOH
use, sober x 35 years. No drugs. patient previously worked as a
letter carrier for the United States Postal Service.

Family History:
Notable for MI; Both parents lived to be > [**Age over 90 **] years old.


Physical Exam:
Patient expired during this hospitalization. He was without
heart sounds, without breath sounds, without spontaneous
movement and without corneal reflex at the time of death at
12:20pm [**2189-12-10**].

Pertinent Results:
[**12-8**] Abd ultrasound
1. No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
2. There is grossly heterogeneous echotexture of the hepatic
parenchyma with [**Month/Year (2) **] architecture related to the patient's
history of cirrhosis. 3. There is a questionable hypoechoic area
in the right lobe of the liver. A liver lesion cannot be
completely ruled out in that area given the limited quality of
this portable U/S study.
4. Moderate amount of ascites and a right moderate pleural
effusion.

[**12-7**] Echo
Suboptimal image quality. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with low
normal systolic function. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic
function. Trivial pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2189-11-25**], the right ventricular
cavity is now slightly dilated with low normal systolic function
and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, etc.)

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M hx CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin, and
recent hospitalization for SIRS now with pneumonia on CXR and
hypotension. In the MICU patient with worsening renal failure,
encephalopathy, without clear source of infection. Medical team
spoke with family, and the decision was made to make the patient
CMO.
.
# Altered Mental Status: Patient had progressive decline of
mental status throughout admission, and the etiology was
multifactorial likely include hepatic encephalopathy, ICU
delirium, and infection. Patient was initially put on lactulose
and zyprexa. His sleep wake cycle was normalized.
.
# Hypotension/tachycardia/hypothermia: Unclear etiology, and
likely related with SIRS. No clear source identified throughout
work up. Patient was initially covered with broad spectrum
antibiotics with early goal directed therapy. Cultures were
persistently negative. He also underwent pituitary and more
central workup - the cortical stim was somewhat abnormal, but
other findings were negative. He remained on pressors and was
taken off when the decision was made to make him CMO.
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Crt to 3.2 without clear
etiology. Urine with increase in whites/red blood cells.  Most
likely related to relative hypotension. Started HRS therapy
yesterday without improvement.
.
# SBP. Repeat diagnostic para with 4 white blood cells. This was
initially suspected as a possible source of the patient's
infection as initial diagnostic para was borderline positive. It
was not consistent with the patient's presenting symptoms,
however. Patient was initially covered by antibiotics for
treatment.
.
# Right pleural effusion. Patient had a chronic right pleural
effusion, but could not lower out a right lower lobe pneumonia.
Etiology of the effusion likely to be hydrothorax, however.
Patient was covered with antibiotic treatment.
.
# Chest pain/recent NSTEMI. Chest pain had resolved. Enzymes
flat. No EKG Changes.
.
# End stage liver disease. Labeled crytogenic but patient with
previous heavy alcohol use.
.
# Pancytopenia. Thrombocytopenia likely [**12-29**] liver disease.
Platelets stable. HIV negative.
