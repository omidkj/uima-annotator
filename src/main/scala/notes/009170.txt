Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
gentleman with a history of end-stage renal disease (on
hemodialysis) and cirrhosis.

The patient presents from [**Hospital1 700**] with
hypotension of 68/45.  The patient was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 69**] on [**1-6**] with
congestive heart failure and fluid overload secondary to
inadequate hemodialysis.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 8544**] on [**1-6**]
after being found unresponsive by his wife right after he was
discharged from our hospital.  On presentation to the outside
hospital, he was found to have atrial fibrillation with a
fingerstick blood sugar of 12 in the field.  The patient
stayed in the Intensive Care Unit for three weeks.  Please
see the outside hospital medical record for details of his
Intensive Care Unit course.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2-10**].
On the day of admission, the patient was noted at
rehabilitation to be hypotensive to 68/45 with a heart rate
of 126.  The patient was transferred back to our hospital.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have a
fever to 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a blood pressure
of 83/60.  His culture from the outside hospital was shown to
have beta streptococcus in [**12-26**] bottles.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient's heart rate was 141 with atrial flutter.  His
pressor was changed to phenylephrine, and his mean arterial
pressures were 70 to 80s.  The patient was admitted to our
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  An abdominal ultrasound showed
a small amount of ascites as well as an accidental finding of
a pericardial effusion with poor right ventricular motion.

The patient has received 500 mg of intravenously levofloxacin
given at the outside hospital, and the patient has received
intravenous vancomycin as well as ceftazidime in our
Emergency Department.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 100.1
degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 100, his blood
pressure was 117/68, his respiratory rate was 24, and his
oxygen saturation was 100% on 5 liters.  In general, the
patient was alert and oriented times three but has
occasionally drifting alertness.  The patient was in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.   The extraocular movements were intact.
The mucous membranes were dry.  Neck had positive jugular
venous pressure.  Cardiovascular examination revealed heart
rate was tachycardic with a [**2-26**] holosystolic murmur at the
left sternal border.  Positive left ventricular heave.  His
lung examination was consistent with decreased breath sounds
at the bases bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft and slightly
distended.  There were positive bowel sounds.  The patient
had an ostomy with urine in the right abdomen.  He had
positive hepatomegaly.  Extremity examination revealed there
was no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  The patient had 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologic examination revealed the
patient was alert and oriented.  He was moving all
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
white blood cell count on admission was 6.1, his hematocrit
was 36.8, and his platelets were 65.  His INR was 1.3.
Electrolytes revealed sodium was 144, potassium was 5.1,
chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was
42, creatinine was 4.9, and his blood glucose was 89.  His
liver function tests were all within normal limits.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His chest x-ray was consistent
with bilateral pleural effusion and was positive for
congestive heart failure.

His electrocardiogram revealed a atrial flutter at a rate of
140.

His abdominal ultrasound showed some free intra-abdominal
fluid.  Also had some gallbladder calculous with a collapsed
gallbladder with intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.  His ultrasound was otherwise unremarkable.

A chest computed tomography showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism but was positive for bilateral pleural effusion as
well as pericardial effusion and ascites.  There was marked
vascular calcification as well as associated atelectasis and
hyperdense appearance of the lung; may be related to both the
bilateral pleural effusion and drug toxicity.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  STATUS POST SEPSIS/HYPOTENSION/TACHYCARDIA AND FEVER
ISSUES:  The patient was started on vancomycin.  The etiology
of his sepsis was unknown.  His line was pulled on [**2-19**], and his blood cultures while he was in the hospital have
all been negative upon discharge.  Although, from [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital on [**2-16**], there were showing 1/4
bottles of blood cultures growing positive for group B beta
streptococcus that was pan-sensitive.

The patient remained afebrile with a good blood pressure and
heart rate throughout the rest of his hospital course and
with the continuation of vancomycin.  The patient was to be
discharged with another one week worth of vancomycin.

2.  RIGHT VENTRICULAR FAILURE WITH SEVERE PULMONARY
HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  Cardiology was consulted on [**2-19**].  They indicated the patient was not a good surgical
candidate.  Per Cardiology recommendation, the patient should
be on aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day, lisinopril 2.5 mg
by mouth every day, and a beta blocker - low-dose metoprolol
at 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.

The patient may not be a good candidate for anticoagulation
for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation given he had a high
risk of bleeding.  This issue can be discussed as an
outpatient.

3.  ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient was started on
hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone for seven days and was to
continue with a prednisone taper over the next two weeks
after discharge.

The patient was shown to have cortisone stimulation test that
was positive for adrenal insufficiency at the outside
hospital.

4.  PERICARDIAL EFFUSION ISSUES:  Without signs of tamponade
on echocardiogram; although right-sided pressures were very
high.  So far, the patient had no indication for drainage.

5.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient is on
hemodialysis.  The patient was to continue hemodialysis on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday course and was also to continue
sevelamer, and vancomycin dose should be dosed renally.

6.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  There was a small amount of ascites.
If the patient spikes, need to consider spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis.

7.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA ISSUES:  The patient's platelets
increased after discontinuation of heparin.  Likely due to
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody.  The patient
should not receive heparin.  If the patient on heparin,
should monitor his platelets very carefully.

8.  PHYSICAL CONDITION ISSUES:  The patient was severely
deconditioned due to his long-term hospitalization.  Physical
Therapy was working with him, and the patient needs 2-person
assistance for almost all activities including going from bed
to chair and ambulating.  Therefore, the patient was to go to
rehabilitation for reconditioning.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.
The patient can only ambulate with 2-person assistance.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to rehabilitation.

three times per day.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg by mouth once per day (hold for a
systolic blood pressure of less than 100).
