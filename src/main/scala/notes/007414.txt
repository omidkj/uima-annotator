Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia, Altered mental status, E.coli urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1193**] is a 61 woman with urosepsis and altered mental
status transferred from [**Hospital 5583**] Hospital in [**State 3914**].
.
Per notes, the patient presented [**2191-11-2**] complaining of [**1-7**]
weeks of not feeling well. Her family states that over the last
2 days she developed increasing confusion and difficulty
breathing. She did not take any meds for 2 days because she was
at her father's funeral in RI. Upon evaluation, she was found to
have hypoxia, a right middle lobe infiltrate, and 48 bands.
Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were administered. She grew
pansensitive e.coli from her blood and urine. During her course,
she developed delerium that was evaluated with a head CT and LP,
which were both reported as normal.
.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment and investigation of delerium
and respiratory alkalosis. En route, she was intubated by med
flight and an OG tube was placed.

MRI Brain
The posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. There are
several small areas of increased signal intensity on the FLAIR
images and bilateral cerebral white matter, which are
nonspecific but could most likely represent chronic
microvascular disease. No abnormality is noted on the
diffusion-weighted images to suggest acute infarcts. The
ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are unremarkable. There is
mild smooth enhancement of the pachymeninges diffusely, is
likely benign, related to the recent lumbar puncture procedure
and is unlikely to explain the patient's presentation. There is
no leptomeningeal enhancement. The osseous and the soft tissues
structures and visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and
the orbits are unremarkable.
.
MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: Bilateral cavernous ICA
and MCA are patent and normal in caliber. The A1 segment of
right ACA is not visualized. Bilateral A2 segments are supplied
by single left ACA which is tortuous in course. Visualized
segments of bilateral distal vertebral arteries are
unremarkable. The basilar artery has an irregular contour,
likely due to atherosclerosis. Right fetal equivalent PCA is
noted; left PCA appears normal.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute infarcts.
2. Chronic microvascular disease.
3. Benign appearing pachymeningeal enhancement, most likely
related to the recent LP and unlikely to explain the patient's
presentation.
4. No leptomeningeal enhancement.
5. Absent A1; bilateral A2 segments supplied by single left ACA;
fetal equivalent of right PCA.
.
CXR [**11-6**]
One supine portable view. Comparison with [**2185-2-18**]. Lung
volumes are somewhat low. There has ill-defined increased
density at the right base and in the retrocardiac area. The
cardiac silhouette is prominent but may be exaggerated by
portable technique. Mediastinal structures are otherwise
unremarkable. An endotracheal tube has been inserted and ends at
the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube has been inserted and
terminates below the diaphragm, off of the bottom of the image.
.
Renal U/S:
RENAL ULTRASOUND:
.
The right kidney measures 10.6 cm. The left kidney measures 14.5
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones
bilaterally. Within the mid pole of the left kidney, there is a
focal area of soft tissue that appears isoechoic to the cortex
and extending into the renal hilum. This does demonstrate some
heterogeneous echoes. Given history of concern for
pyelonephritis and/or abscess, abscess cannot be entirely
excluded on this study. Note should be made that prior CT and
ultrasounds too demonstrate a similar extension of
cortical-appearing tissue into this region; however, today these
findings appear more prominent and more heterogeneous. The
urinary bladder is catheterized.
.
IMPRESSION: Predominantly isoechoic 3.4 x 2.8 x 2.9 cm area
within the left renal hilum in the mid pole which appears to be
present to a partial degree on prior CT and ultrasounds from
[**2185-2-17**] and [**2185-2-14**] respectively. No vascular flow
is visualized within this area. Although not typical of abscess
appearance, abscess cannot be ruled out. Another possibility
includes growth of a soft tissue mass. Recommend followup CT
with contrast for better evaluation.
.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and
drowsy states,
due to the bursts of generalized delta slowing and slow
background
activity. These abnormalities suggests an encephalopathy, which
may be
secondary to infections, medications, toxic metabolic
abnormalities or
ischemia. There were no EEG changes associated with the right
hand
tremors.
.
CT Abdomen Pelvis:
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is bibasilar atelectasis. The
liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and right
kidney are unremarkable. The left kidney is slightly enlarged
diffusely and heterogeneous in appearance with some perinephric
stranding similar to prior study from [**2191-11-3**]. Noted
on today's contrast-enhanced exam is heterogeneous enhancement
as well as a focal area of both enhancement and mass effect
measuring 5.8 x 4.4 cm within the mid portion anteriorly. There
is no definite fluid collection present. These findings are very
suspicious for renal neoplasm. However, this could represent
focal superimposed area of phlegmonous ti
