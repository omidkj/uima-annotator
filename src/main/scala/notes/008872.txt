Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
Left ischemic leg

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Emergent left groin exploration with left femoral embolectomy.


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female who was recently on a lowered
Coumadin dose because of a UTI and antibiotics who presented
with acute pain of her left lower extremity. She had no palpable
pulses in the femoral or distal. Of note,
the patient in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year had a similar episode when she
was subtherapeutic on Coumadin and required an embolectomy. The
patient postoperatively had a hematoma and a groin wound
dehiscence but this ultimately closed and granulated well.
Today, the patient and her family decided
that they wish to have another procedure in order to restore
flow to her left leg.

Operative note:
PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the operating room on
[**2182-7-3**] and laid on the table in the supine position.
The patient's groin and left leg were prepped and draped in a
sterile fashion. Monitored anesthesia care was used and local
anesthesia was given after a time-out was performed and
vancomycin and gentamicin were given for preoperative
antibiotics.

A vertical incision was made in the left groin below the area
of the prior transverse incision and this was carried down to
identify the superficial femoral artery. There was extensive
scar in the common femoral artery area but ultimately the
artery was encircled with vessel loops proximally and the SFA
and profunda were encircled with vessel loops. The area of
the prior arteriotomy closure was seen to and, after the
patient was given 4000 units of intravenous heparin, a
transverse arteriotomy was performed. There was acute
thrombus and an embolus sitting in the common femoral artery
and this was pulled out and there was excellent forward flow
from the external iliac artery which had the clamp released.
There was excellent backbleeding from the profunda. A #3
embolectomy catheter was passed down the profunda and there
was no evidence of clot. A #4 [**Doctor Last Name **] embolectomy catheter
was passed down the SFA with multiple passes and ultimately a
large amount of thrombus was pulled out of the SFA and there
was finally good bleeding. There was noted to be a stenosis
at the origin of the SFA, but this was left alone as there
was good backbleeding.

Heparinized saline was infused into the artery. The
arteriotomy was closed with a 6-0 Prolene from both
directions. All the arteries were flushed and back bled
appropriately and after restoration of flow, there was a
palpable DP pulse in the foot and the color improved.

Hemostasis was obtained and the wound was closed in layers
using 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl and staples for the skin. The
patient had been awake the whole time and tolerated the
procedure well and was taken back to the intensive care unit
in stable condition.


Brief Hospital Course:
Post-operatively the patient did well.  She required pressors in
the ICU to maintain her blood pressure in the normal range and
was soon weaned off POD 1.  She met all ICU requirements and was
transferred to the floor.  She was maintained on a heparin drip
while bridging to coumadin (her INR was 1.2).  On the day of
discharge, she recieved 60 mg Lovenox and 2mg of Coumadin.  She
is afebrile and is ambulating with some assistance given her
age.  She is tolerating a regular diet.

Because of her subtherapeutic INR, she will either need to be 1)
placed on Lovenox lifetime without any need for warfarin or 2)
Lovenox-Warfarin bridge until her INR is therapeutic.  Her INR
should be monitored closely given that this is the second time
she has embolized on a subtherapeutic INR.
