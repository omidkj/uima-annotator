Admission Date:  [**2180-4-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2180-4-7**]


Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a
history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and
congestive heart failure who was in her usual state of health
until the evening of admission when she developed sudden
severe back pain.  She states that the pain came as spasms
radiating once to her left arm.  She has had this back pain
in the past, but nothing as severe as this episode.  She
denies any strain or lifting.  She denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, fevers, chills, cough,
diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.

She has had a history of a myocardial infarction
approximately 10 years ago, and her symptoms then did not
resemble her current symptoms.  She reported to [**Hospital3 **], and a chest CT scan was performed which was read as
having a small dissection in her descending abdominal aorta.
She was started on nitroglycerin and responded well.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

In the Emergency Department, she received 10 mg of
intravenous labetalol, and her vital signs were stable.  She
continues to have intense back pain on arrival, but otherwise
is asymptomatic.

2. Zestril 40 mg po q day.
3. Imdur 60 mg po q day.
4. Potassium chloride 20 mg po q day.
5. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
6. Dyazide 1 tablet q day.
7. Sublingual nitroglycerin prn.
8. Iron.
9. Magnesium.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa and Celecoxib.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco, no alcohol,
and she lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 99.3, blood pressure
95/38, heart rate of 84, respiratory rate of 18, and 98% on
room air.  In general, this patient has paroxysmal episodes
of intense back pain.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Mucous
membranes dry.  Neck reveals no jugular venous distention.
Lung examination had bibasilar crackles and diffuse
expiratory wheezes.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular,
rate, and rhythm, [**4-6**] holosystolic murmur radiating
throughout her thorax.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended and normoactive bowel sounds.  Back:  No spinal
or paraspinal tenderness.  Extremities:  [**2-3**]+ pitting edema
right greater than left.  No calf tenderness.  Neurologic is
alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 5.6, 76% neutrophils, 21%
bands, 2% lymphocytes.  Hematocrit 30.9, platelets 204.
Chem-7:  Sodium 142, potassium 2.8, chloride 112, CO2 19, BUN
33, and creatinine of 1.2.  CK of 31, troponin of less than
0.3.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus arrhythmia at 82 beats per
minute and a left bundle branch block that is old.

Chest x-ray reveals congestive heart failure with mild
pulmonary edema, bilateral small pleural effusions, and
underlying consolidation in the right lower lobe.

A CTA of the chest was performed which revealed no evidence
of aortic dissection and bilateral pleural effusions,
bilateral atelectasis with near total collapse of the left
lower lobe and an atrophic left kidney.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Aortic dissection/left lower lobe pneumonia:  The patient
was admitted directly to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
close observation for aortic dissection.  However, based on
her CT scan of her chest, it was determined that there was no
evidence of aortic dissection and rather her back pain was
due to a left lower lobe pneumonia.  She was started on
levofloxacin 250 mg po q day for a 14 day course.  She was
transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit the
following hospital day and transferred to the floor.  Her
oxygenation requirements continued to improve throughout her
hospital course, and clinically she remained afebrile and
continued to improve while on levofloxacin.

2. Coronary ischemia/CHF:  The patient was noted to have a
mild troponin leak at admission with a troponin level of 1.5.
Her CK enzymes, however, remained flat under 100.  Her
troponin levels rose to a peak of 4.3 on hospital day #3.  A
Cardiology consult was obtained for further evaluation of her
troponin leak as well as possible cardiac catheterization.
She was placed on a Heparin drip for approximately 48 hours.
After reviewing the case, Cardiology recommended cardiac
catheterization, however, the patient declined this
intervention at this time.  A cardiac stress test was also
recommended, but based on the patient's codiagnosis of
pneumonia, it was felt that her stress test would be
suboptimal and should be pursued as an outpatient should she
decide to pursue invasive procedures such as cardiac
catheterization in the future.

It was felt that her troponin leak was secondary to increased
demand secondary to a pulmonic process as well as being in
mild congestive heart failure.  She was diuresed gently with
Lasix intravenously 40 mg with optimal results and her blood
pressure medications were optimized upon discharge.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which revealed
an ejection fraction of 20-25%, mildly dilated left atrium,
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis as well as
moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with a peak velocity of
4.2 meters/second and a valve area of 0.8.  There was also
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and no evidence of
aortic dissection.  Again it is unclear whether the patient
wanted to pursue invasive procedures such as possible surgery
and cardiac catheterization, regardless, she will follow up
with her primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5057**] for
further evaluation and possible outpatient stress test.

Conjunctivitis:  The patient was noted to have increased
purulent discharge coming from both eyes as well as an
inflamed sclerae and conjunctiva.  She was started on
erythromycin ointment for a total of seven days with marked
clinical improvement.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Community acquired pneumonia.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Aortic stenosis.
5. Hypertension.
6. Chronic urinary tract infections.
7. Conjunctivitis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA services and home
Physical Therapy.

1. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
2. Lisinopril 40 mg po q day.
3. Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
4. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
5. Levofloxacin 250 mg po q day x7 days.
