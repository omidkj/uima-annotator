Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**]
Chief Complaint:
failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male nursing home resident transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for w/u of
WBC of 58 and SBP in the 90's without fevers. Pt. was treated
with Levofloxacin for UTI and began having diarrhea for a week.
Patient also had decreased appetite, but had been mentating
well. Per rehab, on the AM prior to admission, he appeared
weaker than usual. On [**4-17**], his SBP was 80/50, HR was 68. He came
in with WBC 58.5 with presumed C.diff. He was on the floor for a
day and was then transferred to the ICU for hypotension, sepsis,
and acidosis.
*
ICU Course: He was hypotensive to 80/50 and was on pressors
(Levophed and Vasopressin) and received intermittent D5W/HCO3
boluses as pt had gap and nongap acidosis. He had received large
amount of fluid (+22L in the ICU) with most fluid accumulating
in his abdomen. He remained on PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl and
Flagyl was just switched to PO on [**4-26**] as pt can now tolerate po
with pureed thick liquids. After aggressive IVF, pressors were
weaned off. He still requires intermittent LR boluses to
maintatin CVP. He had some episodes of a-fib with RPR. he was
also found to be thrombocytopenic with negative HIT Ab. He was
initially DNR/DNI, but after the ICU team discussed with his
nephew [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4640**], he became full code as he wants the pt to
"make it" until Victory Europe Day in [**Month (only) 116**]. He was started on TPN
via the central line as he initially failed swallow eval.
However, on [**4-26**] repeat swallow eval showed that pt could
tolerate some Pureed, honey thick liquid. However, since he
can't take adquate nutrition via PO, the idea of tube feed via
PEG was brought up and the nephew is in agreement with it.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14128**] was admitted with hypotension and c. dif
enterocolitis.  He was intubated and continued to decline in the
ICU, and grew anasarcic from fluid resusitation.  He was kept
comfortable and care was withdrawn once the family was ready.

1. Hypotension/Fluid status- His pressure was initially
controlled with Levophed (0.5 mcg/kg/hr). He continually
required increasing doses of Levophed, which became a concern
with regard to his already compromised renal function (presumed
ATN).  He was transitioned to vasopressin and tolerated this
well. After the pressors were discontinued, he maintained his
systolic blood pressure >100. He also received both normal
saline and Na/HCO3 boluses to manage his pressures.  He received
total of 22 L in the ICU to keep his BP and urine output.  Most
of these fluids have extravasated into third space as his
albumin was 1.5-1.6.  These extra fluids were evidecned by his
remarkable scrotal edema and 4+ pitting diffuse edema.  He
initially went into ATN from hypotension, but once it resolved,
he started to get IV Lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] to diuresis.  The main issue
to mobilize his fluid is his nutritional status.  He was
initially getting TPN but later received post-pyloric tube and
was started on tubefeeds with Nepro.  He will need to be on
minimal IV meds, and standing Lasix 40 mg IV bid and PRN Lasix
with a goal to keep him negative 1 L/day.

2. Infectious- He was admitted with WBC ~69 and peaked to 76
which progressively trended down. Pt had severe C.diff colitis
and sepsis.  He was treated with double coverage empirically
with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin (14 day course).  Flagyl was
changed to PO once he was able to take PO with thick liquids.
Stool C.diff were negative x 2 after the treatment.  However, he
continued to have loose stools, likely since his bowel mucosa
was severealy injured from the colitis.  WBC trended down to 10,
but had an episode of vomiting and likely aspiration pneumonia
as WBC came back up and pt with congested lungs.  He was started
on Levofloxacin in addition to Flagyl which he'll take for total
of 2 week course.

3. Acid/Base status- Initially came in with an anion gap
metabolic acidosis that improved.  Prior to discharge from the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he had a hyperchloremic non-anion gap. He was treated with
Na/HCO3, which also helped with his pressures.  On the floor, he
mainitatined normal acid/base status.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure- Initially pt had ARF, likely
ATN from prerenal insult due to shock. Creatinine peaked at 2.5
but eventually came down to 1.5-1.6 with good urine output.

5. Thrombocytopenia- Platelet count dropped to 55 from 480
within 1 week. HIT antibody was negative x 2. Platelet count
improved once his infection was treated and once he was
hemodynamically stable.  Hematology was consulted and agreed
that transient thrombocytopenia was related to sepsis.

6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response- EKG on
[**4-18**] showed atrial fibrillation. Has one episode of A. fib/RVR
with heart rate to 150s. He received 5 mg diltiazem with good
response, but his pressures dropped.  He was adequately rate
controlled with metoprolol.  Since he had guiac positive stool,
we decided not to start Coumadin in a setting of hemodynamic
instability.  However, once he is more stable and not having any
more guiac positive stool, he should be started on coumadin at
the rehab.

7. CHF- Echo EF >55% ([**4-18**]), moderate TR, mild MR, small
pericardial effusion. As pt was 22L fluid overloaded, he had
pulmonary edema and had to be diuresed with standing Lasix as
noted above.

8. IDDM- Initially on an insulin drip, but was transitioned to
sliding scale and glargine.  He was initially on glargine 30
units and then cut down to 15 units while he was receiving the
TPN.  However, he had two episodes of hypoglycemia. One episode,
where he was found unresponsive with myoclonic jerk and deviated
eyes to the left.  Finger stick was 14, and reversed with one
amp of D50.  It was thought that he got his glargine at noon and
was not scheduled to get TPN until later that night.  Since he
likely has no glycogen reserve, he rapidly went into
hypoglycemia (FS 140's to 14) within few hours.  Therefore,
glargine was stopped.  TPN was eventually stopped as tube feed
was started.  As he tolerates tubefeed and as his intestinal
wall mucosa heals and have better resorption, his insuling dose
needs to be adjusted.  He will likely need either NPH or
glargine later.  However at the time of discharge, he was only
covered with insulin sliding scale.

9. Skin breakdown- Pt with bilateral pressure ulcers on his
heel, buttock/perineal skin breakdown.  He was getting
miconazole powder for dryness/fungus, and lidocaine
jelly/decitin to the buttock/scrotal area.  For his heel ulcer,
he got wet to dry dressing change once/day, and the feet were
elevated by multipodis boots.

10. Anemia of Chronic disease- Hct remained stable at low 30's.
He did require 2 units of PRBC in the ICU.

11. Elevated alkaline phosphatase- CT abdomen showed "distended
gallbladder". Increased ggt so likely liver or biliary source.
Consider RUQ U/S as an outpatient.

12. FEN- Initially, he received TPN in the ICU as he could not
tolerate any PO's based on swallow evaluation.  However, as his
clinical status improved, he was able to tolerate some thick
liquids.  As noted above, he has very poor nutitional status
with albumin of 1.5.  Initially, his HCP/nephew agreed on
