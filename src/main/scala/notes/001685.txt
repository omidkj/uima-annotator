.
CT head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
.
CT C-spine: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture or
spondylolisthesis.
.
CT torso: IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-sized right pneumothorax. Likely lung contusions.
Followup recommended.
2. Non-displaced right eighth, ninth and 10th rib fractures.
3. Hypodensity within the liver consistent with contusion.
4. Right adrenal hemorrahge versus mass. Follow-up imaging
recommended for further evaluation. Discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 67020**]
[**Name (STitle) 58703**] at 10am [**2138-6-22**].
5. Possible small splenic laceration at the dome, with a tiny
amount of fluid around the spleen.
6. No evidence of active extravasation.
7. 1.3-cm likely plaques seen in the aorta at approximately the
level of the bifurcation.
8. Spondylosis and degenerative change is seen within the lower
lumbar spine.
.
CTA chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute aortic injury.
2. Moderate-to-large right-sided pneumothorax, larger when
compared to study performed half an hour earlier.
3. Multiple right rib fractures.
4. Likely lung contusions, follow-up recommended.
5. Increased lung opacities consistent with edema or aspiration.
6. Nondisplaced manubrium fracture.
.
Shoulder XR: : No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation
within the right shoulder. Right rib fracture and right-sided
chest tube seen.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Trauma Service to the T-SICU. A
chest tube was placed for the R PTX. The Acute Pain Service was
consulted and an epidural catheter was placed for analgesia for
the rib fractures. He was placed on a CIWA scale to monitor and
treat any symptoms of withdrawal. His hematocrit remained
stable. On HD 2 he spiked to 103.2 and CXR revealed pneumonia.
He was started on Levaquin. A sputum culture grew out strep
pneumoniae. The epidural catheter was removed and he was
transitioned to PO pain meds. He was transferred to the floor,
diet was advanced, and he worked with PT/OT. He continued to
have an oxygen requirement with SaO2 88% on ambulation. He was
afebrile x 72 hours. Prior to discharge he was ambulating
without oxygen and maintaining an SaO2>91%. He will return to
the Trauma Clinic for follow up. He will be maintained on RISS
until he completes the course of Levaquin, at which time
transition to oral agents would be appropriate (interaction
between Levaquin and OHAs can cause profound hypoglycemia).
