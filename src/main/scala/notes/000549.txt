Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2116-5-8**] Redo Sternotomy, Redo Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
with saphenous vein grafts to left anterior descending, obtuse

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old male s/p CABG in [**2114**], graft failure
[**2115-4-11**] undergoing cypher(DES) stenting of LAD and LCx, and
three prior Vision (BMS) placed in mid and proximal LAD and one
to the proximal circumflex arteries. He recently presented to
[**Hospital6 **] with precordial chest "heaviness" [**9-20**],
on [**2116-5-5**]. He concomitantly had shortness of breath with chest
pain but denied nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and presyncope.
No radiation of pain. He was noted to have new 2mm ST
depressions v4-v6, TWI v3-v6. He received IV morphine, NTG x3,
and was started on weight based enoxaparin regimen. He was
already on Plavix. Pain was controlled to point where he was
chest pain free in ED. He ruled in for a NSTEMI. Initial neg
trop 0.04, that rose to 1.26, then 1.34. CK peak at OSH was 94.
He was stablized on medical therapy and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
after diagnosis of NSTEMI so that he could be managed by his
primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient
was chest pain free. Pt had ECG w/ new 1-2mm ST elevation in
V1-V2, and 2mm ST depression v4-v6, TWI v3-v6. 1mm ST depression
and TWI in I & avl are old. Pt was started on Heparin and
Integrillin on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].

Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
[**2116-5-7**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Limited coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated severe three (3) vessel coronary artery disease.
The right
coronary artery was diffusely diseased with pressure damping
upon
engaging.  The RCA had a 70% proximal lesion. The left main was
diffusely diseased with a 70% distal lesion.  The left
circumflex
demonstrated 70% in-stent restenosis of the proximal stent.  The
left
anterior descending artery was diffusely diseased with a tight
95%
proximal lesion along with serial 90% in-stent restenotic
lesions in the
proximally placed stent.
2.  Arterial conduit angiography was deferred - LIMA-LAD known
atretic.
Venous conduit angiography was also deferred since both grafts
known to
be occluded.
3.  LV ventriculography was deferred.
4.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate central
aortic
(160/73mm Hg) hypertension.
[**2116-5-7**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Less than 40% internal carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.
Findings suggesting distal left vertebral artery occlusion.
[**2116-5-8**] Intraop TEE:
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20 - 25 %). There moderate global RV
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post- CPB: The patient is on an infusion of Epinephrine. RV
systolic fxn is normal. LV systolic fxn is moderately globally
depressed. MR is 1+.
No AI. Aorta intact.

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2116-5-12**] 2:02 PM
CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: ? effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion
HISTORY: Status post CABG.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-11**], the chest tubes have
been removed. No evidence of acute pneumothorax. Extensive
opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid
and underlying atelectasis, though the possibility of
supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 72 y/o M w/ DM, HTN, s/p CABGx4V [**2114**], graft failure
[**4-17**],w/ multiple stents, most recent cath shows occluded SVGs
and LIMA-LAD arterial conduit, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
OSH w/ NSTEMI,
Cardiac Cath: [**5-7**]
LMCA: Distal 70% lesion
LAD: Origin 95% lesion w/ serial 90% lesion ISRS in the previous
DES. The origin D1 has mild restenosis.
LCX: Non-Dominant vessel w/ 70% origin ISRS in the previous DES.
The OM1 origin is widely patent.
RCA: Dominant vessel with proximal 70% lesion at previous mild
lesion. There are r-l collaterals to the LAD and distal OM.
.
#Pump: Patients last echo [**10-18**] showed EF of 35-40%, with mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferolateral and inferoseptal walls and
apex.

Cardiac Surgery
Pt brought to operating room for redo CABG on [**5-8**]. Please see
OR note for details, in summary patient had redo CABG x3 with
SVG>LCX, SVG>LAD, SVG>PDA, his bypass time was 109 minutes with
a crossclamp of 74 minutes. He did well in the immediate postop
period, was kept sedated throughout the night and was extubated
on POD #1. Additionally his swan was removed. His mediastinal
tubes were taken out POD #2. Cordis was replaced with a triple
lumen catheter due to diffic
