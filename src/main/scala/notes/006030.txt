Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation, femoral and internal jugular central
line placement

History of Present Illness:
76yo W h/o multiple systems atrophy, paroxysmal AF on aspirin,
DM2, HTN, HL, lumbar spinal stenosis who presents with a cardiac
arrest. Per family, the patient was at home and was having some
difficulty with her secretions (choking sounds) when she
suddenly collapsed. CPR was initated by the family, and the fire
department arrived with pads, which advised no shock.
Subsequently she was to be pulseless, with PEA bradycardia, and
was given 1 mg epinephrine, with ROSC. Enroute, she lost pulse
again, with similar pads advising no shock, and was given
another 1 mg epinpehrine, with ROS. At the scene, she was
intubated, a left lower extremity IO was placed. She did not
lose pulses in the emergency department, and was placed with a
right femoral triple lumen, started on amiodarone gtt, as well
as levophed. EKG was ready by cardiology fellow as likely atrial
fibrillation with LBBB. She had a CT head, which was negative.
Of ntoe, she was recently discharge [**2171-10-12**] with a stuttering
course of 24-48 hours of left facial weakness and leaning to the
left in addition to difficulty in swallowing. At that time, a
head CT was negative for acute ischemic or hemorrhagic, and the
team felt that MRI would not change the treatment MRI was not
performed and she was
continued on conservative treatment. She at that tiem was also
noted to have difficulty swallowing, as well as occasionally
SBPs in the 180s, for which she was started on lisinopril. At
that time, she developed fever and as U/A was positive for
bacteria she was started on ceftriaxone for 3 days, but was
subsequently discontinued after urine culture reportedly came
back negative, although cultures here appear to be positive for
VSE.
Labs notable for an ABG with 7.17/58/159, K 2.4, Lactate 8.5,
HCT 95, and a free calcium 0.95. WBC elevated at 15.6, HCT 32,
Plt 188. U/A was very dirty with large leuks, large blood, many
RBCs and WBCs, and mod bacteria.
On arrival to the MICU, she is intubated and sedated.

Brief Hospital Course:
76F history of multiple systems atrophy, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on aspirin, DM2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
lumbar spinal stenosis who was admitted for cardiac arrest. The
etiology of cardiac arrest was likely multifactorial and
potentially related to infection such as toxic megacolon and ?
aspiration. It was also noted that she was hypokalemic as well.
Her husband initiated CPR at home although it was noted that the
patient was DNR/DNI during prior hospitalization. The patient
was treated with standard post-arrest protocol including cooling
for neuroprotection. She was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia, C.
difficile given toxic megacolon despite negative stool antigen,
and urinary tract infection. Surgery consultation was deferred
given the patient was not an operative candidate. Continuous EEG
was performed showed minimal cortical activity. Code status was
also changed to DNR/DNI as if the patient were to re-arrest, it
would be unlikely that further resuscitation would be effective.
After re-warming, the EEG remained flat with intact respiratory
drive on pressure support. A discussion was held with her family
including her husband regarding likely poor neurological
prognosis. It was decided to pursue comfort-focus measures. The
patient was extubated and subsequently died on [**2171-10-20**]. Family
was notified and declined autopsy.
