Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 101915**] is a 63yo female with ESRD on HD s/p VF arrest. She
completed dialysis (1L off, 3.0K bath), tolerated ok, and was
then found unresponsive. On arrival of CCU team, pt found ashen,
pulseless, apneic, unresponsive. CPR initiated with good effect,
lasted approximately 3 min. CPR prior to monitor leads being
placed-> identified polymorphic VT/VF. Shocked 200J-> CPR
continued, pt intubated. Given insulin 10U, D50. Rhythm checked
-> narrow complex brady, but still no pulse. CPR reinitiated,
[**11-27**] amp calcium given, Epi, bicarb, and atropine prepared, but
rhythm revealed sinus tach w/ good pulses.

Initial postcode blood pressure = 170/110, pt responsive and
fighting tube attempting to pull out. Transferred to CCU for
further management (did not receive remaining code drugs).

On arrival to CCU, pt requesting extubation, good MS, passed SBT
5/0. Therefore extubated, but then became anxious, tachypneic,
Sats high 80s on NRB->99-100 on CPAP NPPV. Subsequently, BP to
80s, and echo revealed new WMA and depressed EF. Therefore, pt
taken to cath lab emergently. Revealed no flow limiting disease,
PCWP 21.

Post-cath continued to do well, initiated on CVVHD for slow
fluid removal.

Relevant Imaging:
Cardiac Catheterization ([**11-7**]):
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA free of angiographically significant
disease. The
first diagonal branch had a 70% stenosis at its origin. The LCX
system
demonstrated a widely patent previously placed stent in OM1; OM2
had a
50% stenosis. The RCA had a distal 40-50% lesion at the crux
involving
the RPDA and RPL branches.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
pressures.
There was moderate pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated
right
ventricular filling pressure.

ECHO ([**2142-11-9**]): There is moderate symmetric LVH. The LV cavity
is unusually small. There is mild to moderate global LV
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The AV
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. AS is estimated as
severe although severity may be overestimated. The MV leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial MR is seen. The LV inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-11-7**],
there is no definite change.

[**2142-11-11**]: CTA chest/abd/pelvis:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. New
confluent opacity in the right upper lobe, most likely
representing atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Follow-up imaging to document resolution and exclude an
underlying mass is advised

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 63 yo female with Primary
Amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD with stent placement in OM in [**10-1**]
and fixed septal defects in the lateral segments,
hypothyroidism, major depressive d/o, schizoaffect personality
d/o, s/p vtach/v.fib arrest in HD on [**2142-11-7**], PEA, and then
returned to NSR but with persistent hypotension and oxygen
requirement. Hypotension resolved with re-hydration and
initiation of midodrine.

1. CV.
-Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD with
stent placement in OM1 in [**10-1**] and fixed septal defects in the
lateral segments. Repeat catheterization following the cardiac
arrest revealed patent vessels with stable coronary disease.
Repeated EKGs showed no ischemic changes. She continued to
receive aspirin and plavix daily.  Throughout her
hospitalization she c/o persistent CP which was likely due to
chest compressions, not ischemia related. No BB or ACE-I was
initially started due to tenuous blood pressure post HD
sessions. Her BP was supported w/Midodrine. As her BP improved
she was started placed on Lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] which she was
able to tolerate. The Midodrine was stopped since her blood
pressure stabilized and Free Care was not able to cover this at
time of discharge.

-Rhythm: The patient presented with a VF arrest in the setting
of hemodialysis.  The likely cause for the arrest was
multifactorial including: dehydration exacerbated by severe
aortic stenosis, electrolyte shifts associated with
hemodialysis, and QT prolongation secondary to anti-psychotics.
She was evaluated by the EP service and it was concluded that
her given her overall co-morbidities particularly the
amyloidosis that had been found in both bone marrow and kidney
would likely limit any benefit an ICD placement could offer.
Furthermore, as she would be treated with myelosuppressive
therapy for the amyloidosis/smoldering myeloma, the risk of
infection and needed to explant the device also made device
placement not indicated. She was started on amiodarone as VF
suppressive therapy.

-Pump:  The patient has a diminished EF following the cardiac
arrest.  The EF mildly improved when repeated during the
hospital stay.  Her severe aortic stenosis with AV area 0.8cm2
limited her cardiac output.  However, given her active
co-morbidities she was not considered a surgical candidate.
Also, the valve area was already at the estimated post-balloon
valvuloplasty diameter so pursuing this procedure would offer no
benefit.  To optimize her blood pressure, her pre-load was
increased with re-hydration and she was started temporarily
placed on midodrine both of which acheived a good result.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated
during the cardiac arrest and was successfully extubation. She
did have a persistent oxygen requirement that was thought to be
multifactorial including: pulmonary contusion, pulmonary edema,
aspiration pneumonia during the arrest, and splinting from the
sternal trauma of CPR. She was maintained with CVVH and HD near
her outpatient dry weight.  She was treated for 10 days with
antibiotics for the aspiration pneumonia with flagyl and
ceftriaxone last day of abx [**11-20**].  Supplemental oxygen was
provided and weaned as tolerated.
