HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old female with a past medical history significant
for coronary artery disease, status post cardiac
catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**] in
[**2125**] showing 70% LAD, status post PTCA, diabetes mellitus
with neuropathy and nephropathy, hypertension, presenting to
[**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2132-2-14**] with nausea, vomiting,
and chest pain for several days.

On presentation to [**Hospital3 3583**], blood pressure was
181/93, respiratory rate 13, temperature 101.2, fingerstick
283.

Initial EKG showed the rate of 115, atrial fibrillation, left
axis deviation consistent with left anterior hemiblock, ST
depression 1 to 2-mm anterolaterally and T wave inversion
inferiorly.

Per the admission history and physical at [**Hospital3 3583**],
the patient's ST segment changes were about the same as in
[**2131-12-13**].  The patient was started on Heparin, IV
Nitroglycerin, Levaquin for faint bilateral infiltrates on
chest x-ray.  Also, in the emergency department at [**Hospital3 6265**], the patient was given charcoal for possible
medication ingestion because the patient was slightly
confused.  Head CT was negative and serum toxicology screen
was negative.

At [**Hospital3 3583**] initial cardiac enzymes were as follows:
CK #1:  250, CK #2:  246.  CK #3:  136.  Troponin was 1.34
(normal less than 0.4) MB fraction 5.7 to 6.  Followup EKG
during the hospitalization showed questionable prolonged QT
interval and, therefore, Zoloft and Levaquin were
discontinued.

On the morning of [**2132-2-17**], the patient developed
more chest pain, unrelieved with Nitroglycerin.  The patient
was given IV Morphine and Aggrastat IV.  The EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm with rate of 62, normal axis, T-wave
inversions anterolaterally and inferiorly.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].  On transfer to [**Hospital1 69**],
the patient was chest-pain free.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac
catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**] in
[**2125**], showing 70% LAD lesion, with PTCA of the lesion and 20%
residual stenosis.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by nephropathy and
neuropathy.  The patient requires a walker at home.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  History of urinary tract infection.
6.  Depression.
7.  Stress urinary incontinence.

The last echocardiogram was done on [**2132-1-2**]
showing a normal ejection fraction with mild inferior
hypokinesis.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to TEGRETOL.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
Admission labs at [**Hospital3 3583**] were as follows:  White
blood cell count 15.9, hematocrit 40.6, platelet count
230,000, 76 neutrophils, 12 basophils, 6 lymphocytes.  PT and
PTT, INR were 11.5, 24, 1.0.  Urinalysis showed no leukocyte
Estrace, no nitrates, 0 to 1 white blood cell count.  Chem 7
showed the sodium of 139, potassium 3.5, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 28, BUN 19, creatinine 1, glucose 159.

FOLLOW-UP LABS:  Follow up labs at [**Hospital3 3583**] revealed
the following:  A drop in the hematocrit from 40.6 on
admission to 33.4 on [**2132-2-17**].

Admission labs at [**Hospital1 69**] were
as follows:  WBC 7.6, hematocrit 33.8, platelet count
234,000, 62% neutrophils, sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride
97, bicarbonate 27, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4, glucose 124, PT
12.6, PTT 63.6, INR 1.1.  The EKG at [**Hospital1 190**] showed T-inversions anteriorly in V1 through
V3 and inferiorly; normal sinus rhythm; normal axis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that this was an
80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease
status post PTCA to LAD in [**2125**], type I diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, transferred from an outside hospital,
presenting with angina, elevated troponin.  The patient was
admitted from an outside hospital with non-ST segment
elevation MI.  The patient was transferred for a cardiac
catheterization.

#1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ischemia.  The patient was chest-pain
free when admitted to the hospital.  The patient was
continued on Heparin, IV Nitroglycerin, and Aggrastat IV.
The patient was continued on antihypertensive regimen on
transfer with the exception of the Valsartan, as the patient
was already on an ACE inhibitor.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled
and noted to have trended down from an outside hospital.
Cardiac catheterization was done on [**2-18**], showing
mildly elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure (20)
no mitral regurgitation, normal left ventricular ejection
fraction, focal posterobasal hypokinesis.  The patient had
multivessel PTCA.  The LAD showed proximal diffuse disease to
maximum 80% stenosis and extending to ostial V2.  The RCA had
proximal calcified 80% stenosis, mid 80% stenosis.  The
patient had two stents placed in the proximal and distal LAD,
with no residual stenosis.  The patient also had two stents
placed in the proximal RCA with 10 to 20% residual stenosis.

After cardiac catheterization, the patient was started on
Plavix and Aggrastat drip was continued until the morning
after cardiac catheterization.  Post cardiac catheterization
hospital course was complicated by mucous membrane bleeding
for a short period (from nose, mouth), followed by abrupt
cessation.  The patient was continued on Aggrastat without
further bleeding.

The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled post cardiac
catheterization and were all negative.

The patient's antihypertensive regimen was modified as
follows during the hospital course:  The patient was
continued on Lisinopril 40 mg p.o.q.d.; Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d.; and Amlodipine 2.5 mg p.o.q.d. added for optimal
blood pressure control.  The patient's systolic blood
pressures were noted to be mildly elevated (150s to 160s).

#2:  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was noted to have
crackles ?????? of the way up on admission.  However, chest x-ray
showed no evidence of CHF, and clinically, the patient did
not have S3 or elevated jugular venous pressure.  The patient
was continued on her standing dose of Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
Oxygen saturations were followed and were within normal
limits throughout the hospital course with the patient not
requiring more oxygen above her baseline.  As the admission
chest x-ray did not show any infiltrates and the patient did
not have the signs and symptoms of pneumonia, antibiotics,
which were started at the outside hospital were followed.

#3.  RENAL:  The patient's creatinine was noted to be 1.2 on
admission.  With the patient's history of diabetic
nephropathy, Mucomyst was administered prior to cardiac
catheterization and the patient was given pre-catheterization
and po
