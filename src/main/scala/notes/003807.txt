Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
55yo F with h/o metastatic uterine CA with recurrent pleural
effusions requiring QOD drainage via pleuravacs at home (last
emptied on day of admission), pericardial effusion, and h/o
upper extremity dvts on fondaparinux at home after failing
lovenox therapy admitted with SOB. Patient initially presented
to [**Hospital6 **] with increased dyspnea, bedside TTE
showed no pericardial eff, new ARF, with creatinine of 1.4 and k
of 7. There she received kayexalate, insulin, glucose, lasix 40
mg IVX1. she was noted to be in Afib and received metporolol
25mg po x1, 5mg iv x1. She also complained of back pain and
received one dose of dilaudid 2mg IV.
.
Initially here patient reported that she went to the OSH not for
SOB but weakness and poor po intake. VS initially in our ED
were: T 97.2 HR 83 BP 105/63 RR 20 O2sat 100% on 2L NC. Then ,
in our ED she felt acutely dizzy with BP 85/56 HR 106 AF and
complained of SOB with RR 36 and O2 sat 100% on 4L NC. She was
placed on NRB for her comfort although she did not need it based
on her O2 sats. She did not tolerate the NIV. CXR showed
bilateral basilar infiltrates/effusions and she received one
dose of zosyn.K was 6.2 and she received insulin and dextrose as
well as calcium. Lasix 40mg Iv was given with 200mL UOP. Repeat
K was 5.9. A bedside TTE showed no pericardial effusion. She was
given 0.5mg IV ativan for anxiety and a dose of dilaudid for
pain. She also received 500mL NS. VS prior to transfer to the
floor were T 98.2 HR 105 BP 96/54 RR 19 100% on NRB .
.
On the floor, the patient reported that she had been short of
breath since leaving the hospital on [**6-4**]. It had not gotten any
better. In addition her sister reported that she had been eating
very little and getting weaker at home. She also had discomfort
from being in bed all the time but denied back pain. She denied
fevers, cough, sputum, sick contacts. She did endorse chest pain
on inspiration. She also noted palpitations and tremulousness as
well as increased anxiety.
.

Past Medical History:
- Metastatic endometrial CA with lung metastases and recurrent
pleural and pericardial effusions requiring QOD drainage via
pleurex catheter
- Upper extremity dvts on fondaparinux
- Afib with RVR
.
ONC history (from OMR):
Presented [**3-/2187**] with postmenopausal vaginal spotting. She had
an endometrial biopsy which showed poorly differentiated cancer.
She underwent on [**2187-4-24**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2028**] an
exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, total pelvic lymphadenectomy,
periaortic lymph node resection and infracolic omentectomy and
biopsies. Pathology revealed serous adenocarcinoma with
endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous metaplasia, it was a
grade III tumor 7.5 cm in the greatest dimension with mets to
the ovaries bilaterally. She had three out of the left pelvic
lymph nodes involved with metastases and two out of seven right
pelvic lymph nodes involved with metastases as well as a right
periaortic lymph node. Omental biopsy was negative. The patient
was treated for her stage IIIC papillary serous endometrial
cancer with four cycles of carboplatinum and Taxol by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and treatment started on [**2187-5-24**] and
completed on [**2187-7-27**]. She also started whole abdominal pelvic

radiation. She began radiation on [**2187-10-11**] and completed in
12/[**2186**]. On the CT scan followup in [**2-/2188**], the patient had an

interval development of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules
associated with significant mediastinal adenopathy and left
axillary adenopathy. She also had diffuse, low-density hepatic
lesions consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
-complicated by large pleural/pericardial effusions, s/p
drainage of both with pleural drain in place

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 55yo F with h/o metastatic endometrial CA
complicated by bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial
effusion requiring intermittent drainage via pleuradex catheter
and bilateral upper extremity DVTs on fondaparinux and O2 (1L
NC) at home admitted with SOB, ARF, Afib with RVR.
.
#. SOB: Initially CXR showed right-sided infiltrates worse from
prior and concerning for HCAP vs aspiration PNA. She was started
on broad spectrum abx (Vanc/zosyn) on [**2188-6-15**] for presumed
pneumonia. Legionella antigen neg. Influenza DFA neg. MI was
ruled out with three sets of cardiac enzymes.  Plan for drainage
qod per home regimen but did not have large effussions at
presentations and had been drained day of admit.
.
# Hypotension: SBP in 80s-110s range on admission. Patient
likely with low-running BP at baseline with question of
contribution from infection given CXR findings and leukocytosis
despite remaining afebrile. Treated with broad abx as above.
Unable to place a-line for closer monitoring of BP. Thought to
be dehydrated but unable to place bedside RUE PICC successfully
(LUE limited by DVT). Able to place one PIV. Femoral line
discussed as an option but not pursued given goals of care and
absence of emergent need. Pt maintained SBP in 110s overnight.
On the AM of [**6-16**] - BP transiently decreased to 50s while
mentating well, unclear if spurious, as subsequent cuff read
back to 110s. However, about 9AM found to have 50/palp BP on
doppler measurement by RN. HO notified. At this time, pt went
into SVT which terminated in asystole. No resuscitative efforts
as pt was made DNR/DNI day prior on discussion with family.
.
# ARF: Patient had had recent CTA and also had had poor po
intake while ta
