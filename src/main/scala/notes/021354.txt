CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum times one day

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55 year old
female with a history of coronary artery disease, St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]
aortic valve replacement, congestive heart failure, diabetes
mellitus Type 2, now insulin-requiring with a
gastrointestinal bleed.  On [**8-12**], the patient was admitted
to [**Hospital3 **] with a congestive heart failure
exacerbation and was treated with Lasix, had an INR of 2.7 on
Coumadin for her aortic valve replacement.  On [**8-14**], the
patient's hematocrit was 28.7, she felt constipated and had
bright red blood per rectum with bloody stools and clots.  In
the morning of [**8-15**], hematocrit went from 20 down to 12.
The patient's bleeding and coagulation were reversed with 4
units of fresh frozen plasma, 4 units of packed red blood
cells.  A nasogastric tube was placed with clear gastric
return.  On transfer the patient had an INR of 1.7,
hematocrit of 20.7 after the third unit.  Heartrate was in
the 90s to 100s.  Blood pressure in the 90s/40s.  Of note the
patient had a history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeds
over the last six months before admission requiring multiple
transfusions.  Five weeks before admission the patient
underwent cautery of her right angiodysplastic lesion in her
colon.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 55 year old male with multiple
medical problems including coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with pacemaker,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, aortic valve
replacement on Coumadin, now with a gastrointestinal bleed
from a likely arteriovenous malformation with an myocardial
infarction in the setting of a hematocrit down to 12.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - The patient had an
myocardial infarction with a troponin up to 7.6 in the
setting of her hematocrit down to 12, had chest pain,
multiple times throughout her hospital admission which
responded to Nitroglycerin and Morphine.  The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2117-8-25**].  Total
occlusion of her right coronary artery which appeared chronic
with right to right collaterals and left to right collaterals
to tiny and distant right coronary artery vessels, was not
felt to be repairable with percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty or bypass.  Also had a 60% tubular stenosis of
her obtuse marginal 1 which was felt not to be a critical
lesion and did not have the appearance of an unstable plaque,
was not percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied or
sent.  The patient was medically managed for her coronary
artery disease on sublingual nitroglycerins which were
switched to Imdur, was also started on low dose Zestril as
well as Metoprolol and diuresed with Lasix and Metolazone.
The patient returned briefly to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for more aggressive diuresis for right-sided heart
failure with a diuresis of nearly 12 liters during the three
days of her stay there.  At the time of discharge the patient
has subjectively improved her breathing as well as continued
to be chest pain free for over one week with oxygen
saturations consistently in the high 90s to 100% on 2 liters
which is a home oxygen.  For her history of aortic valve
replacement, the patient has been restarted on Coumadin with
a goal INR of 2 to 3, for anticoagulation with the aortic
valve replacement as well as her atrial fibrillation.  She
has not shown any evidence of embolic phenomenon from either
while on heparin.

2.  Infectious disease - Initial presentation was one of
bilateral lower extremity cellulitis which was treated with
intravenous Ancef, was then discontinued after resolution of
her symptoms as well as physical examination appearance.  She
had a brief course of Levofloxacin for a urinary tract
infection.  No evidence of infection currently.

3.  Heme - Hematocrit has been in the range of 29 to 32.  She
has required multiple units of packed red blood cells to
maintain her hematocrit.  She was started on iron and Folate.
She may continue to need transfusions in that she continues
to have blood in her stools.  She will need to stay on
Coumadin for her aortic valve replacement as well as for her
atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

4.  Endocrine - The patient has a history of diabetes for
which she was covered with an insulin sliding scale and was
given NPH insulin with fingersticks in the 100s to 200s.  On
discharge her fingersticks have been more stable in the low
100 range on NPH insulin as well as regular insulin sliding
scale.

5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient presented with a
gastrointestinal bleed likely from an arteriovenous
malformation in her colon.  These arteriovenous malformations
were discovered on colonoscopy as well as enteroscopy at [**Hospital6 **] showing arteriovenous malformations in
her right colon as well as her transverse colon.  The patient
underwent an interventional radiology embolization of her
right colon after a bleeding scan was suggestive of continued
bleeding in the area.  After the procedure the patient
continued to have melanotic stools which gradually resolved
and continued to be occult blood positive.  The patient may
still have a small amount of bleeding in her colon, however,
it does not warrant further workup
