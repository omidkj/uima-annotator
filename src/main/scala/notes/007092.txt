hurt himself by taking the meds and he said yes. He was
initially taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he had a GCS 15,
vomited x2 and was intubated for airway protection during which
no burns were seen. An NG lavage was done and he was treated
with charcoal and sorbital.  CT head and CXR were normal and he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Of note, he has no history of prior
suicide attempts.
.
In the ED, intial labs were remarkable for WBC 14.2, Cr 1.7,
acetaminophen level of 8 and lactate of 2.9. Toxicology was
consulted and recommended following EKG's for QRS prolongation
(>120 ms). If so, treating with bicarb.  EKG was done with QRS
of 112 so no bicarb was given. A CXR revealed small bilateral
pleural effusions but otherwise no acute process. He received
propofol for sedation and 4L NS. VS prior to transfer BP 119/69
HR 67 Sat 100% on CMV 100% FiO2, TV 580 mL and PEEP 5.

patient's primary manifestation of his injestions was
respiratory depression. He was seen by social work and
psychiatry, the latter who concluded that he will need inpatient
psychiatry. He cannot leave AMA. He has a 1:1 sitter. He had
some rhabdomyolysis was given fluid repletion. He was seen by
GI, who performed a EGD that showed erythema in esophagus signs
of injury with no further follow up needed. He was extubated
later the day of his admission. After extubation, he spiked a
fever to 101.0 with a high suspicion for pneumonia and was
started on a course of vancomycin and cefepime x 8 days. He is
currently on day 2 of his course. He has been kept NPO due to
risk of aspiration. He is visited daily by his children and his
ex-wife. [**Name (NI) **] also began to have symptoms of withdrawal, including

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89089**] is a 66 year old man with a history of bipolar
disorder who was found down with multiple empty pill bottles and
toilet cleaner around him.  He initially presented to OSH with
lethargy and was intubated for airway protection. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

#. Overdose/Ingestion:  The patient was found down by family
with multiple pill bottles (lamotrigine 150mg 2 bottles filled
[**3-1**] and [**4-30**] both with #180 pills, lisinopril 10mg filled [**7-18**]
#180, clonazepam 0.5mg 2 bottles filled [**1-30**] and [**2140**] both with
#135) and toilet bowl cleaner/drano that were half empty around.
 Taken to an OSH where he became lethargic and required
intubation for AMS.  Tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU intubated.  In the
MICU the patient was able to maintain his pressures although
still with AMS.  EGD performed showing only minimal caustic
injury and they signed off on him.  Serial EKGs performed
without significant QRS widening. In PM of day of transfer, the
patient was on minimal vent setting and was able to be
extubated. Since extubation, the patient has been oxygenating
well. On [**8-1**] he was transitioned to NC and was stable for
transition to the floor. On the floor, he had no further issues
related to his overdose.

#. Pneumonia: After extubation in the MICU, the patient spiked a
fever and was found to have consolidations on CXR concerning for
aspiration PNA. He was started on a course of vancomycin and
cefepime for an 8 day course. On hospital day 4, he was switched
to levoquin from the broader course. After he was changed to
haldol for his agitation, his QTc was followed on EKG and was
found to be wnl. Due to concern after his trigger, the levoquin
was switched to ceftriaxone Q12H to complete the four day
course. The patient had a cough but otherwise remained afebrile
throughout his stay. His ceftriaxone was discontinued on day 8
of his antibiotic course. He was afebrile one day after
discontinuing his antibiotic course and has not been symptomatic
for several days.

# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient triggered for HR to 200s with
apparent SVT while on the floor, hospital day 4. He was
administered adenosine 6, 6, 12 and 18 during the course of the
trigger with mom[**Name (NI) 12823**] relief of the aberrant rhythm. He was
also given 5.0mg lopressor total. Cardiology was consulted, who
believed it to be Afib with RVR. Shortly after the lopressor
doses, he converted to sinus with HR 90 and was stable
