Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 83 year old male
with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis who had initially presented on [**5-23**]
at Hemodialysis with decreased p.o. intake and one week of
cough productive of clear sputum.  In Hemodialysis, the
patient was also noted to be rigoring, at which time blood
cultures were drawn and the patient was subsequently sent
home.  At home, the patient experienced generalized weakness
and so presented to the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, initial vital signs were a
temperature of 103.0 F.; heart rate 88; blood pressure 94/68;
respiratory rate 20; pulse oximetry 96% on room air.
Emergency Department work-up revealed a slight left shift
without elevated white blood cell count and a left lower lobe
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  The patient was treated in the
Emergency Department with Vancomycin 1 gram and Gentamicin
100 mg given his history of prior Methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus line sepsis.

The patient experienced an episode of hypotension to 64/40 in
the Emergency Department, which was asymptomatic (normal
mentation).  The patient was bolused one liter of normal
saline and systolic blood pressure increased appropriately to
107.  Per the patient, his baseline blood pressure is 90 to
100 systolic, and generally 85 systolic following
hemodialysis.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
from the Emergency Department for relative hypotension and
concern for sepsis.  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, temperature was 99.2 F.; heart rate 66; blood pressure
94/36; respirations 15; pulse oximetry 95% on room air and
the patient was asymptomatic.

The Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for the
addition of Levofloxacin to the patient's antibiotic regimen
for atypical organism coverage in the setting of community
acquired pneumonia.  The patient did not receive any further
doses of Vancomycin or Gentamicin following the Emergency
Department visit.  Levofloxacin was dosed q.o.d. given the
patient's renal failure and at the time of discharge, the
patient had received a total of 3 doses.

By report, culture data from hemodialysis on [**5-23**] showed
no growth from blood cultures.  Admission blood cultures at
[**Hospital1 69**] have shown no growth to
date.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit without further hypotensive episodes.  He
was continued on amiodarone for his atrial fibrillation and
Coumadin for anti-coagulation in the setting of atrial
fibrillation.  His INR was noted to be subtherapeutic at 1.5
on admission.

A Renal consultation was obtained and the patient was
dialyzed on hospital day number three.  Also on hospital day
number three, the patient was transferred to the ACOVE
Service for continued care.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient noted a
minimally productive cough.  The patient had a good appetite.
No shortness of breath, chest pain, back pain, fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting diarrhea, black or bloody stools,
dysuria, headache.  The patient was feeling his baseline on
transfer to the ACOVE Service.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The initial hospital course is as outlined
in the History of Present Illness.  The patient was
transferred to the ACOVE Service on [**5-25**].  The patient had
a temperature spike on [**5-25**] to 101.5 F., at which time
blood cultures were drawn; to date blood cultures have shown
no growth.  Levofloxacin was continued for community acquired
pneumonia.  The patient was feeling his normal self and was
afebrile on the day of discharge.

He received in-house dialysis prior to discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Diet renal and cardiac.
2.  Activity as tolerated.
3.  The patient is to continue Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.
q.o.d. to end [**2112-6-2**], for community acquired pneumonia.
4.  The patient to continue outpatient hemodialysis as
directed.
5.  The patient to continue Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q. day until
hemodialysis on [**5-30**], at which time a repeat INR will be
checked.  The patient refused a blood draw prior to discharge
to assess INR.  Given that he is on Levofloxacin he has been
advised at discharge to continue his current Coumadin dose
until the INR recheck.
