Pelvic arteriogram [**2196-3-16**]


History of Present Illness:
89F s/p mechanical fall at home. Taken to OSH where CT showed
right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures with an
associated hematoma tracking up the rectus sheath measuring 10 x
3.5 x 6. The patient was hypotensive with low BP's in the
80s-90s at the OSH. She was given blood for a HCT 28.1 and

was negative.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

[**2196-3-16**] CTA torso:
1. Right superior pubic ramus fracture with associated complex
fluid collection seen along the anterior abdominal wall and
within the right side of pelvis, consistent with hematoma.
Findings are stable and unchanged when compared to prior
imaging. No evidence of active arterial extravasation on this
study. However, this is within the limits of suboptimal IV bolus
timing and acute extravasation cannot be fully excluded;
however, given that the size of the hematomas have not changed
significantly since the prior examination, these are likely
stable.
2. There is infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring
maximum 4.3 in
anterior-posterior diameter and 4.3 cm in transverse diameter.
2. There is infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring
maximum 4.3 in
anterior-posterior diameter and 4.3 cm in transverse diameter.

[**2196-3-16**] Pelvic arteriogram
Unsuccessful right common femoral artery access. Successful left

common femoral artery access with a pelvic arteriogram
performed. AP and
oblique projections did not demonstrate evidence of active
contrast
extravasation at this time. No further intervention was
performed. The
patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no early
complications.

[**2196-3-18**] CXR :
Pulmonary vasculature previously engorged on [**3-16**], is now
normal to
slightly increased in caliber. There is no pulmonary edema.
Pleural effusion is small on the left, if any. Heart size
normal. Left subclavian line ends close to the superior
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ACS service was taken for urgent
IR angio given that there was active extravasation seen on her
CTA torso. However, they did not visualize any active bleeding
and no intervention was performed.

Post-procedure, the patient was admitted to the TSICU for close
monitoring. Serial hcts were checked. These initially remained
stable but then began trending down during the latter part of
the day on post-procedure day 1 to a nadir of 21.3. She was
transfused two units of blood and one unit of platelets (for a
platelet count of 49) and her post-transfusion bumped
appropriately to 31.7.

Hemodynamically, the patient remained stable. Her diet was
liberalized and she tolerated a regular diet without problems.
She transferred to a regular floor bed on [**3-18**]. Pt did spike a
fever up to 101.3 once on the floor.

On [**3-19**] Pt continued to be HD stable. HCT remained stable. Pt did
begin to show sign of delirium and agitation which was addressed
with Zyprexa. Cultures and CXR were obtained and pt was started
on empiric vanc/zosyn.

On [**3-20**] pt continued to wax and wane. A geriatric consult was
obtained, and Seroquel was started instead of Zyprexa. Her blood
cultures were preliminarily negative as was her urine culture.
A sputum culture could not be obtained but the working diagnosis
was pneumonia based on a slightly elevated WBC and increased
opacity of the left lower lobe on chest xray.

She developed ATN on [**2196-3-21**] possibly from the dye load from the
angiogram.  Her urine output was adequate with additional IV
hydration and gradually it declined.  Her admission creatinine
actually was 1.5 but it decreased to a low of 1.0. Her
Vancomycin was stopped in order to eliminate nephrotoxic drugs
and she continued to improve.

The Physical Therapy service recommended short term rehab to try
to increase her mobility and endurance.
