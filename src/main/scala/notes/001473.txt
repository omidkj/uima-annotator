Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: MVR well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.

PERICARDIUM: Effusion is loculated.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. Local anesthesia was provided by
benzocaine topical spray. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). 0.2 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given as an
antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. The mitral prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet motion. There is a large echodense
(>2cm) collection (likely clot) in the pericardium. This
echodense mass is impinging on the right atrium and right
ventricle.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 74495**] was a direct admission to the operating room where
he had a CABGx4/MVR on [**2-23**]. Please see OR report for details.
In summary he had CABG x4 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-Diag,
SVG-PDA and MVR with #31 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic porcine valve. His bypass
time was 181 minutes with a cross-clamp of 107 minutes. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
He had marked bleeding from the chest  tubes on the day of
surgery and returned to the operating room for reexploration. He
tolerated this well and again returned to the ICU in stable
condition. He was kept sedated after the reexploration and  on
POD2/1 was allowed to wake, weaned from the ventilator and
extubated. Over the next 24 hours he was weaned from his iv
drips and his PA catherter removed. He was noted to have
intermittant episodes of Atrial fibrilation and was started on
Amiodarone and Warfarin. On POD [**3-29**] he was transferred to the
step down floor for continued care. Once on the floors his
activity level was advanced with PT and nursing, his chest tubes
and epicardial wires were removed and on POD 6 he was ready for
discharge to rehab.
