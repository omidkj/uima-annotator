History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72M left handed psychiatrist with h/o ESRD s/p
ECD renal transplant [**2131**] complicated by bx-proved BK nepropathy
treated with cidofovir now with failing graft (Cr 3.5), diffuse
large B cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **] ([**Date range (1) 95198**]) and
2xIT MTX and 2xIT ARA-C with bone mets, CAD and CABG x3 [**2130**],
CHF with EF 30% and 2+ MR, DM, depression, and laryngeal ca who
presents from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of altered mental status.


As recently as [**2138-11-9**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] was seeing pts as a
psychiatrist after finishing five months of chemotherapy for
lymphoma. His wife notes some paraphasic errors in his speech
and difficulties with abstraction over the past year, but not
major cognitive deficits. He was able to walk with a cane, but
had progressively worsening gait from neuropathy secondary to
diabetes and vincristine. In late [**Month (only) **], he fell four times
in one week and felt significantly weaker so his PCP advised him
to seek medical attention. He was hospitalized [**Date range (2) 95199**].
Recurrent falls thought to be multifactorial with a degree of
spinal stenosis and neuropathy.

He was readmitted [**Date range (1) 95200**] from rehab for AMS.
Admission BUN 103 and Cr 4.4. Found to improve when sedating
medications (lorazepam, oxycodone, modafinil, buproprion,
gabapentin) removed and with HD. No infectious etiology
identified. D/C'ed to [**Hospital1 **].

Over the next two weeks, pt's wife continued to be concerned
about his mental status. Per wife, he was disoriented and
talking about "running marathons." Dr. [**Known lastname **] was seen by his
oncologist on [**2139-1-6**], who also noted disorientation. Thought
possibly due to uremia, but no improvement with HD, so
oncologist did LP. CSF with 8 WBC, 3 RBC, Protein unavailable,
Glucose 105, HHV negative, culture negative, and "clonality not
assessed due to insufficient B cells.:

Dr. [**Known lastname **] continued to stay at [**Hospital1 **]. He improved
slightly, at one point able to get OOB and walk 100ft with
walker and PT. After this improvement, however, his mental
status became progressively worse. Wife describes pt as
disoriented to time and place. He once asked for peanuts when he
was already holding some in his hands. Over the last several
days, these confusional states have gone from intermittent
(worse in early AM and then PM) to continuous. Per wife, today's
hospitalization results from cumulative decline and was not
precipitated by an acute event. Wife does not recall any recent
medication changes or acute illnesses other than above.

Pertinent Results:
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] with and without contrast- [**2139-1-21**]- Nodular subependymal
enhancement corresponding to FLAIR and T2 abnormality.
The main differential consideration is lymphomatous
infiltration. Small
vessel chronic ischemia may co-exist.

EEG- [**2139-1-20**]- This is an abnormal routine EEG due to
intermittent left
temporal theta slowing and right temporal sharp waves. These
findings
suggest subcortical dysfunction on the left and cortical
irritability on
the right in the temporal
