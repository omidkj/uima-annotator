LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative laboratory values were

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2169-10-26**], the patient was admitted for
an elective coronary artery bypass graft.  After consent was
confirmed, the patient was taken to the operating room for a
coronary artery bypass graft.  Please refer to the previously
dictated operative note by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**2169-10-26**],
for full details of the surgery.  In brief, a four vessel
coronary artery bypass graft was performed which the patient
tolerated well.  Of note, the patient did receive several
units of packed red blood cells during the procedure.  She
was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition and
intubated.  On postoperative day two, the patient's Intensive
Care Unit course was remarkable for hemodynamic monitoring
and attempted extubation.  On postoperative day two, the
patient was extubated, however, because of respiratory
insufficiency, she had to be reintubated and she remained
intubated until postoperative day five on [**2169-10-31**].  She
stayed in the Intensive Care Unit until postoperative day
seven during which time she was evaluated by the swallow
team, nutrition team, the physical therapy team.  It was
determined that she was able to tolerate a p.o. diet and that
she would eventually need to be discharged to rehabilitation.

On [**2169-11-3**], the patient was transferred to the floor where
she was tolerating an oral diet.  Her main issue on the floor
was her fluid status.  The patient was markedly fluid
overloaded following the week in the Intensive Care Unit and
she was gently diuresed for her week on the floor.  Despite
this, she had consistent bilateral pleural effusions and
congestive symptoms including bilateral 2+ pedal edema.

She was followed with serial chest x-rays which showed slowly
resolving bilateral pleural effusions and eventually
interventional pulmonology was consulted on postoperative day
fourteen, [**2169-11-9**], but the effusions were not able to be
tapped due to scant layering while the patient was supine.
In addition, [**Last Name (un) **] team was consulted to assist with the
patient's diabetic status prior to discharge.

On discharge, neurologically, she is being treated with
Klonopin and Benadryl to help her sleep.  Cardiovascularly,
she is on Amiodarone.  To help with her atrial fibrillation,
she is also being anticoagulated with subcutaneous Heparin
twice a day, Plavix and Aspirin.  Pulmonary wise, the patient
does receive nebulizer treatment every four hours with some
relief. She still has bilateral pleural effusions.
Gastrointestinal, the patient is tolerating [**Doctor First Name **] diet without
nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.  She is on sliding scale
insulin and she also receives Protonix and laxatives.
Hematologically, the patient's hematocrit is stable at 33.0
prior to discharge.  FEN - she is a markedly fluid
overloader, however, she is diuresing well on 40 mg of Lasix
once a day and receiving Potassium supplementation with her
Lasix dose.  Also, prior to discharge, the patient's latest
creatinine was 1.4 which has been treading downward over the
past week.  Infectious disease - The patient will go home on
a ten day course of Levaquin.
