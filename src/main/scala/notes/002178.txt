History of Present Illness:
HPI: 87-year-old male w PMH significant for CAD, CRI, AFib, B
SDH [**3-2**] requiring craniotomy, and dementia who was transferred
from [**Location (un) 620**] for possible percutanouus decompression of
gallbladder for cholecystitis in association with sepsis.
.
Pt was in his usual state of health until 2 days prior to
admission to OSH when he developed bilateral lower back
discomfort, generalized weakness, and F/C.  In ED at [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**8-19**], pt found to have temp of 104.9 with ?rigors, UTI +/- ? LLL
PNA given dirty UA and possible LLL infiltrate on CXR. Pt given
ceftriaxone, azithromycin and Levo and 2L NS. He was then in
shock c sBPs in 70s on arrival to the floor and was transferred
to the ICU where he recieved 6L IVF. Blood pressure stabilized
transiently. Within the same day the pts Cr bumped from 1.8 to
2.6 (felt to be secondary to ATN/sepsis) and his AST/ALT
increased from the 40s to the 500s (felt to be due to shocked
liver). Further fluid resuscitation was aborted due to high CVP
and CHF picture on CXR. The pt was hypoxemic and placed on NRB,
felt to be secondary to fluid overload.  Intubation was never
required.  The pt was also in NSR on admission and converted
back into a fib.  On HD2 at the OSH, the pt again became
hypotensive with SBP in 70s, requiring pressure support with
levophed. On [**8-20**] the pt's WBC increased from 4 on admission to
46 and his bands increased from 5% on admission to 25%. Blood
cultures grew [**3-1**] GNRs( sensitive to ceftazidime and resistant
to ceftriaxone) and urine culture grew E coli. The patient was
switched to ceftazidime.
.
Also on HD2 at the OSH, the pt complained of right lower
quadrant pain, and a RUQ ultrasound was performed that showed:
cholecystitis with contracted gallbladder with thickening and
edema but no stone/ductal dilatation. As the pt was having
diarrhea, there was also a concern for C diff so flagyl was
added. Finally, one dose of gentamicin was given for double
coverage for gram negative sepsis.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for percutaneous placement of
cholecystostomy tube to decompress the gallbladder.
.
In the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**], levofloxacin was discontinued, and blood
cx/UA/CXR were repeated.  Pt was transferred on NRB--satting at
100%, which was quickly changed to 6LNC.  CXR revealed LLL
infiltrate with probable associated small L pleural effusion.
Blood cx thus far reveals gram neg rods in the anaerobe cx,
multidrug resistant including to CTX, cefazolin, amp, gent,
fluoroquinolones, bactrim.  Initially the pt was on levophed but
this was held as his SBP was in the 100s.  IVF was also held
given pts CVP was 18.  Pt was given Lasix 20 mg IV x1 with
improved oxygenation.  HIDA scan was performed which revealed
normal gallbladder filling, and surgery did not think this is
c/w cholecystitis.  As there was concern after pts platelets had
been 140 on admission to OSH and dropped to 61 here, DIC panel
was ordered and was negative, ASA held.  Amiodarone was
increased for tachycardia.
.
Prior to transfer to the floor, the pt was noted to be
hemodynamically improved with SBP of 120, slightly tachy in afib
with HR in 100s-120s, oxygenating well on 6L NC, afebrile, Cr
down to 2, ALT down to 453, AST down to 286.
