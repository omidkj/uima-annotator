Permanent pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o male with CKD, HF with preserved EF (EF 55%, [**2194-5-8**]),
AAA, and history of escape junctional bradycardia with
retrograde P-waves that was attributed to excessive AV nodal
blockade (Diltiazem) who presents with intermittent palpitations
for approximately 4 days, each episode lasting approximately one
minute in duration, which the patient describes as a funny
feeling in his chest. He had an episode prior to arrival to the
ED that had resolved prior to arrival. The patient's wife
explicitly stated that he did not complain of chest pain but did
have some back pain. The patient's family called EMS when he
began expressing chest pain. Per EMS, he was bradycardic to the
30s for which he received Atropine once. He further received
Aspirin 81 mg x 4.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, the patient stated that his chest pain
had resolved as above but reported that he felt lightheaded and
overall feeling unwell. His HR was noted to be in the 40s with
SBPs in the 90s initially. No significant EKG findings other
than bradycardia were reported. He was noted to have pulmonary
crackles on exam but no other significant physical exam findings
were reported. Labs were significant for a K of 5.7, BUN of 39,
and serum creatinine 3.4 (up from a recent baseline of 2.0-2.4).
He received Calcium gluconate, insulin and D50 for his
hyperkalemia, which was later followed by an Albuterol nebs. He
received several doses of Atropine (2) as well as Glucagon for
reversal of any excess beta-blockade. His systolics were noted
to be mostly in the 90s with one episode of hypotension to the
high-70s, during which the patient was reportedly asymptomatic.
He was subsequently started on Dopamine at 2.5 mg/min. Transfer
vitals were HR 47, BP 103/60, RR 14, 93% on 2L.
.
Of note, his family noted a deterioration in his mental status
following either administration of either Atropine or Glucagon.
They further stated that he is typically a very organized and
oriented individual though they did state that he has poor
vision and decreased hearing.
.
Upoon arrival to the floor, the patient was noted to be delirius
and unable to answer quetions. History was obtained via his
family. The family believed that he may have been taking older
or

FINDINGS: A dual-lead left pectoral pacemaker device has its
leads
terminating at expected locations in the right atrium and right
ventricle. No pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasal atelectases are mild.  Bilateral lungs are remarkable
for mild vascular and interstitial prominence, likely
congestion. Normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o male with CKD, dCHF, AAA, and h/o bradycardia who
presents with symptomatic bradycardia with junctioanl escape
rhythm.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Bradycardia: Junctional escape rhythm with retrograde P waves
likely related to initiation of metoprolol on previous
admission. Metoprolol was held and isoproterenol was started. He
returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm shortly after admission. A
permant pacemaker was succesfully placed. A EKG showed NSR above
the set rate of pacemaker, CXR showed good placement of leads.
He did have some episodes of tachycardia on telemetry. He may
benefit from metoprolol to prevent tachycardia.
.
# Acute kidney injury on CKD: Serum creatinine elevated to 3.4,
up from recent baseline of 2.0-2.4 believed to be from
hypotension in the setting of bradycardia. His ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] were
held and his creatinine improved. He will have a follow up visit
with his renal doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3390**] who will decide on restarting his
ACE/[**Last Name (un) **].
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Had pulmonary edema
on admission likely from bradycardia on baseline CHF also
possible exacerbated by acute kidney injury. He was diuresed
with IV lasix with resolution of euvolemia.
.
# Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission but BP increased
after he was in NSR. His BP meds were initially held. Amlodipine
was restarted. ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] were held in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] but may
possibly be restarted as directyed by outpatient [**Last Name (un) 3390**] and
nephrology. Metoprolol was not restarted but may be beneficial
to prevent tachycardia.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Outpatient Renal follow-up
#Creatinine check in 1 week
