Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, Digoxin Toxicity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
In brief, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with a hx of Afib on
digoxin who was referred by VNA for bradycardia. HR was 30s. Of
note, the pt maintained her blood pressure despite profound
bradycardia. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] does say that she was feeling tired
prior to arrival but denied dizziness, syncope, and chest pain.
She denies recent illness, diarrhea, dysuria, shortness of
breath and cough. She says that she has been in her normal state
of health recently; she has 24 hour health aides who helps her
with all of her meals and gives her her medications. Per one of
the NPs who cares for her, she has been eating less recently but
did not seem otherwise ill. There was a concern for at UTI over
a week ago because blood was found in her diaper; it was later
determined that blood was likely from a lesion but patient
completed course of Cipro.
.
Labs drawn in the ED revealed hyperkalemia (potassium 8.2) and
acute renal failure (creatinine on admission 3.1 from 1.5 most
recent baseline in [**Month (only) 547**].) In the ED, she got 2 amp D50, 30 g
kayexalate, 10u reg insulin, 2 albuterol neb, 1 mg atropine, 2
vials digibind, 1 amp bicarb. Renal and toxicology both provided
recommendations.
Upon transfer to the floor, vital signs 96.4, HR 36, BP 122/54,
RR 19 94% on 2L NC. Transient decrease in BP to 90/70 that
resolved without intervention.
.
Patient was initially admitted to the ED, where her heart was
initially in a junctional rhythm in the 20s and 30s but
converted spontaneously to NSR in the 80s, where she has since
remained. There, her potassium decreased to 4.8 from 8.2, her
creatinine improved from 3.1 to 2.7 after 1 L IVF and her dig
level down to 1.2. Patient was given 5 mg Vitamin K twice to
correct a elevated INR.
.
Upon transfer to our team, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] reports feeling tired, but
denies any pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with a hx of Afib on digoxin, CHF who
presented to ED with digoxin toxicity, profound hyperkalemia,
and acute renal failure, who presented with complaints of
fatigue but otherwise asymptomatic.
.
#) Digoxin Toxicity: Patient presented with Dig level 3.7. The
etiology is thought to be due to poor po intake over last week
causing renal failure, with possible UTI (asymptomatic.) Of
note, patient was afebrile with normal white count. She was
given 1 L IVF in the ED and received 2 vials of Digibind; and
admitted to the ICU, where her heart was initially in a
junctional rhythm in the 20s and 30s but converted spontaneously
to NSR in the 80s. On discharge from the ICU to the floor, she
was in atrial fibrillation in the 100s, she remained in afib but
with rate in 70s-80s. Digoxin continued to trend down to normal.
Digoxin was stopped with no plan to restart as outpatient.
Metoprolol and Lasix were originally held. Lasix was restarted
at full home dose and Metoprolol was restarted at half home
dose.
.
#) Hyperkalemia: Pt's potassium on presentation was 8.2. It
resolved with interventions to normal values. Most likely
secondary to digoxin toxicity and acute renal failure. No EKG
changes characteristic for hyperkalemia during admission.
.
#)Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt presented with Cr 3.1 that
appeared to be elevated from new baseline 1.5 in [**Month (only) 547**]. Etiology
unclear, but patient presented with initially concerning U/A
positive for protein and hyaline casts. ARF was likely a
pre-renal component as creatinine improved after fluids and with
encouraged PO intake. Of note, UPEP negative. Patient did not
receive more fluids on the floor (after 1 L IVF in ED/ICU) out
of concern for oxygen requirement in the setting of CHF. Lasix
was originally held but restarted once Cr was improving.
Discharge Lasix dose was 80 po q
