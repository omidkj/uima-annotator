History of Present Illness:
56 year-old female with a history of chronic systolic CHF (EF
15%), HTN, morbid obesity, and asthma who presents with
increasing SOB, DOE, b/l LE edema, and weight gain. She was
hospitalized from [**2122-2-4**] to [**2122-2-25**] for decompensated CHF and
was diuresed aggressively (40 lbs off) with Lasix gtt and IV
Diuril. She was re-admitted a few days later for abdominal pain
and also found to be in acute renal failure. She was discharged
on a reduced dose of torsemide and also told to stop her
lisinopril, HCTZ, and spironolactone. When seen in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic at
the end of [**Month (only) 958**], she appeared to still be euvolemic and
arrangements were made to have her weight at home transmitted to
VNA, as she did not formerly weigh herself at home. Her weight
had increased by 30 lbs by the end of [**Month (only) 547**] and was told to
increase her torsemide to twice a day, but her weight continued
to increase to 360 lbs by [**4-30**] and she started to become more
SOB and wheezy. In addition, her BP was noted to be 80/60 and
her O2 sat on RA was 92%. She was reluctant to come to the
hospital and so the plan was to increase torsemide to 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
if her SBP was >90. However, her SOB continued to get worse and
she presented to the ED.

In the ED her VS were 97, 73, 102/59, 19, 100% on 4L NC (on 2L
NC at home at baseline). A Foley catheter was placed. She was
given 80mg Lasix IV and put out 1400cc. EKG was unchanged from
prior. CXR showed mild fluid overload. Bilateral LENIs were
negative for DVT. She had no chest pain and was breathing and
speaking comfortably. She was admitted for decompensated CHF.

Past Medical History:
- NSVT & low EF; had been considered for PM/ICD due to NSVT and
low EF, but not felt to be a candidate given poor compliance and
other comorbidities
- AVNRT: evaluated by EP in the past, pt not interested in any
further intervention
- COPD/Asthma (FEV1/FVC 83%) on home O2 at 2L
- CHF (EF 15-20%) from non-ischemic CM (? secondary to
cocaine/polysubstance use), dry weight ~300lbs
- Gout
- Morbid obesity
- Cocaine/Heroin/ETOH abuse
- Ventral hernia
- OSA
- h/o medication non-compliance
- Hep B & C positive

unemployed, lives with son and mother lives upstairs. Smokes
tobacco occasionsionally. Cocaine and heroine abuse in the past
but denies recent use; denies etoh.

Imaging:
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2122-5-3**] 10:34 PM
IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study secondary to patient body
habitus. No evidence of lower extremity DVT.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2122-5-3**] 9:11 PM
IMPRESSION: A mild congestive failure with stable marked
cardiomegaly.

Right Upper Ext ultrasound [**5-8**]:
No DVT in the right upper extremity.

CXR [**5-20**]:
Marked cardiomegaly is stable. haziness of the perihilar regions
is new consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Right
PICC tip is in the proximal SVC. There is no pneumothorax. If
any, there is a small left pleural effusion.

TTE [**2122-5-21**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail (anterior leaflet). At least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the highly eccentric (posterior)
trajectory of the regurgitant flow, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly underestimated (Coanda
effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At
least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2121-3-17**], partial flail anterior mitral leaflet is now
present. The mitral regurgitation may be increased, and may be
significantly underestimated on this study due to the Coanda
effect. The left ventricular ejection f
