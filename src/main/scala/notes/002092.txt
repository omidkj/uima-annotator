HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50-year-old man
with past medical history of hypertension only, who was
transferred from an outside hospital for tachypnea, ARF, and
hyponatremia.  The patient reported that his symptoms started
with right shoulder pain on [**2161-7-24**].  On [**2161-7-25**] he had
chills, fever, and fatigue.  His symptoms then began to
include diarrhea, frequent urination, nausea and vomiting,
and feeling thirsty.  He presented to his primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2161-7-27**] complaining of dry cough, and an
inability to take liquids down.  On that day he had a chest
x-ray that showed a right upper lobe infiltrate and a white
count of 24.8.  He then presented to an outside hospital on
[**2161-7-28**].  He was treated there with Levaquin,
Zithromax/ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  He was febrile to
101.2.  His creatinine then went from 1.1 to 3.6 at transfer,
and his sodium went from 133 to 124, and his white count went
from 24.8 to 36 at transfer.  He also had increasing
shortness of breath and tachypnea and worsening infiltrate on
chest x-ray.  His arterial blood gas on transfer was
7.5/33/65 on three liters nasal cannula.  His first arterial
blood gas at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was 7.47/29/56.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He complained of dry cough, thirst, dry
throat, and indigestion relieved with water.  He denied
exertional angina, chest pain, or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  He reported increasing dyspnea over the past two
days.  There was no sputum production.  He reported dark
stools.  He complained of indigestion but denied exertional
angina on arrival.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2. Status post
appendectomy.  3. Status post vertebral fracture.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Cardizem CD 240 q.d.  2. Norvasc 5 mg q.d.
3. Tigan 300 q.i.d. p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  Iodine and codeine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives in [**Location 7661**].
He works at [**Company 39532**].  He does not drink or smoke.  He worked
26 years with heavy metals and arsenic and eight years as a
driver for mentally retarded patients.  His wife smokes 2??????
packs per day x 20 years.  At [**Company 39532**] the patient works in
the freezers.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Myocardial infarction in brother in his 40s,
colon cancer in uncle.

LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratory studies were significant for
a white count of 31.3, hematocrit 38.8, sodium 124,
creatinine 2.4.  The patient's baseline creatinine was 1 to
1.1.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 101.2, heart rate 116,
saturating 95% on five liters nasal cannula, respiratory rate
34-40, blood pressure 140/70.  The patient had increasing
respiratory effort but was able to talk in full sentences.
His pupils were icteric, extraocular movements intact,
conjunctival edema, alert and oriented x 3.  Cranial nerves
II-XII were intact.  There was increasing jugular venous
pressure.  Neck was supple.  Skin was warm.  The right upper
half of his lungs had decreased breath sounds and bronchial
breath sounds at the apex with E to A changes.  Decreased
breath sounds were heard bilaterally at the bases.  The heart
was regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, and tachycardic.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops were noted.  There was no cyanosis,
clubbing, or edema.  Abdomen was obese, distended, soft, no
[**Doctor Last Name **] sign, no fluid wave or shifting dullness.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia
with a right upper lobe opacification, a small right
effusion, and a small left effusion.

Other significant laboratory studies included an albumin of
2.2.  An EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 116 with a left
axis, normal intervals and peaked T waves in V2 to V5.

ICU COURSE:  1. Respiratory failure:  The patient was
intubated in the ICU on [**2161-8-1**] after an arterial blood gas
revealed 7.5/33/65 on three liters nasal cannula.  He was
intubated for hypoxemia.  The patient remained intubated
until [**2161-8-11**] when he was extubated.  On transfer to the
medicine floor he was saturating 98% on two to three liters
nasal cannula.

2. Pneumonia:  Chest CT on [**2161-8-4**] showed multifocal
pneumonia, most severe in the right upper lobe with extensive
necrosis, positive air-fluid levels, evolving lung abscess
which involves other lobes bilaterally in the lungs with
small right pleural effusion.  The patient was initially
treated with Zosyn and Levaquin but due to a drug reaction,
the Zosyn was discontinued on [**2161-8-9**] secondary to a rash.
His antibiotics were changed to Levaquin and clindamycin.
The patient was also intermittently treated with vancomycin.
On transfer to the floor he was on Levaquin and clindamycin
IV.  A BAL on [**2161-8-4**] showed 4+ PMNs, sparse yeast, and
rhinovirus.  A Legionella urinary antigen was negative.  A
BAL from [**2161-8-1**] was the same.  All blood cultures grew
nothing.  The effusions were never tapped while the patient
was in the ICU.

3. Acute renal failure:  On admission the patient's
creatinine was 3.6.  His creatinine rose to 7.6 on [**2161-8-3**]
and the patient required hemodialysis via Quinton catheter.
He received hemodialysis on [**2161-8-4**], [**2161-8-5**], [**2161-8-7**],
[**2161-8-8**], and [**2161-8-10**].  After his last dialysis, his
creatinine was increased to 8.6 from 7.4.  On the day before
transfer out of the ICU the patient began having increasing
urine output of more than two liters a day, presumed to be
post ATN diuresis.  A renal biopsy during the ICU stay was
consistent with acute interstitial nephritis, presumed to be
caused by Zosyn or erythromycin, which the patient was receiving
for bowel motility.  On [**2161-8-4**] his peripheral eosinophils were
only 3%.  The renal team followed the patient during his entire
hospital stay and the patient was receiving Solu-Medrol IV
for the AIN ( interstitial nephritis) when he left the ICU.

4. Hyponatremia:  The patient's sodium was 130 on the day of
admission.  It dropped to 118 on the same day and remained in
the low 120s.  Serum osmolality was 261 and urine osmolality
was 238.  Hemodialysis corrected his hyponatremia and on
transfer to the floor his sodium was 135 and stable.

5. Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit on admission was 36.6.
It dropped steadily over his ICU course.  Stools were guaiac
negative.  Hemolysis laboratory studies were negative with a
reticulocyte count of 1%.  His anemia was thought to be
secondary to sepsis or renal failure.  The patient required
transfusion of two units on [**2161-8-5**], and again one further
unit on [**2161-8-12**] with appropriate bumps in his hematocrit.
Renal team started Epogen TIW.

6. Rash:  The patient developed a drug rash beginning on
[**2161-8-8**], morbilliform and erythematous.  It was thought to
be associated with antibiotics.  His erythromycin was
discontinued and then the Zosyn was also discontinued.
Dermatology was consulted and they felt the rash was a drug
reaction/hypersensitivity, likely due to Zosyn, and the rash
improved with Benadryl and Sarna.

HOSPITAL COURSE POST TRANSFER OUT OF ICU:  1. Pneumonia:
The patient was continued on IV clindamycin and IV Levaquin
until transfer out of the ICU.  His Levaquin was then
switched to p.o. and his clindamycin was kept as IV.  ID
signed off but suggested the patient required likely a six-
to eight-week course with serial CT scans of the chest to
determine actual length of course.  The patient was slowly
weaned off his oxygen over the course of his stay, and on
discharge was on no oxygen, was saturating between 95 and 97%
on room air, and could walk comfortably without desaturating.
A chest CT on [**2161-8-15**] showed continued right lung
consolidation mostly in the upper lobe which was slightly
better with cavitation and abscess, also some congestive
heart failure and volume overload, and moderate-sized
bilateral effusions which were slightly bigger than
previously, and the CT was felt to be consistent with
pneumococcal pneumonia or Legionella pneumonia.  Chest x-ray
at discha
