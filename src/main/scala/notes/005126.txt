History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1274**] is a 69 year old male with HTN, DM, Hyperlipidemia,
and recent PE [**3-2**] s/p 6 months of anticoagulation completed 1
month ago, presents with shortness of breath and chest pressure
on exertion for three days.  Patient reports that the chest pain
is a "dull" pain that does not radiate.  It is associated with
dizziness and diaphoresis.  He denies cough, hemoptysis, fevers,
chills, orthopnea, PND.  He denies any similar episode in the
past.  He reports that at baseline is able to walk 50 yards and
now is unable to walk more than a few steps.  He reports that
the episodes last 20 to 30 minutes and are relieved with rest.
He reports that these symptoms are differnt from his
presentation for PE in that that presentation was associated
only with chest pressure and no shortness of breath.
.
In ED, vital signs were 98.8, 140/91, 16, 95% RA initially, to
88% RA at one point.  He was placed on 2L NC.  CXR was found to
be normal. He was initially given a NS bolus, then stopped after
giving 350 cc for unclear reasons. Although there was concern
for PE, a CTA was not performed due to Cr of 2.0.  He was
started on heparin drip, and then given lipitor, lopressor,
mucomyst, and aspirin.

STUDIES:
========
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-9-30**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable
appearance of thorax.
.
EKG [**2143-9-30**]
Sinus rhythm. Since tracing of [**2143-5-2**] there is no significant
change.
TRACING #1
.
LUNG SCAN  [**2143-10-1**]
IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio of acute pulmonary embolus.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2143-10-1**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly to moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2143-3-18**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now
higher.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2143-10-2**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
patent.
The LAD had 50% stenosis in its mid portion. The LCX and RCA
were
without significant disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The left sided filling
pressures
were elevated (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg and RVEDP was
19mmHg). The pulmonary arterial pressures were significantly
elevated measuring 76/31mmHg. The left sided filling pressures
were moderately elevated (mean PCW pressure was 24mmHg and LVEDP
was 18mmHg). The systemic arterial pressures were elevated
measuring 153/74mmHg. There was no significant gradient acorss
the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left
ventricle into the ascending aorta. The cardiac index was
measured at 2.6 l/min/m2  using an assumed cardiac consumption
rate.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Elevated pulmonary artery pressure.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-10-3**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is little
overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Specifically, there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2143-10-3**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2143-10-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. New multiple bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary
emboli. Compared to the most recent chest CT dated [**2143-5-1**] all of
these pulmonary emboli are new.
2. Multiple pulmonary opacities are also noted. Given that some
of these have a nodular appearance, a followup scan when the
patient's symptoms resolve in approximately 3-6 months is
recommended to ensure resolution and to exclude underlying
pulmonary lesions.
.
CT ABD&PELVIS W/O C COLON TECHNIQUE  [**2143-10-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. 2.7-cm hemi-circumferential sigmoid colonic mass highly
suspicious for malignancy.
2. No CT evidence for lymphadenopathy or metastatic foci.
3. Additional 6 mm and 5 mm ascending colonic polyps and
possible tiny rectal polyp.
4. Two 9-mm hypodense left adrenal lesions probably represent
adenomas.
5. Bilateral pulmonary emboli again demonstrated.
.
IVC GRAM/FILTER  [**2143-10-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful placement of G2 IVC filter below the renal veins
within a single IVC.
DIAGNOSIS:
Colon, sigmoid mass, biopsy:
Adenocarcinoma, see note.
Note:  Invasion cannot be evaluated due to the superficial
nature of the specimen
.
COLONSCOPY [**2143-10-11**]
Polyps in the ascending colon
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Mass in the sigmoid colon at 35cm (biopsy, injection)
Stool in the solid stool in right colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
EGD [**2143-10-11**]
Mucosa suggestive of short segment Barrett's esophagus
Erosions in the antrum
Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with gastritis
Erythema and congestion in the first part of the duodenum
compatible with duodenitis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
