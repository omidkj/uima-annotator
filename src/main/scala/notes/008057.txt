History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 7958**] is a 62 year old male with a history of severe
coronary artery disease who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**2114-7-15**].
The patient experienced a "band-like" chest pain, radiating to
his back and identical to his usual anginal symptoms.  These
symptoms were accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, and
lightheadedness.
.
The patient reports that he has had these symptoms in a very
minor form since his last discharge from [**Hospital1 **] in [**12/2113**], but
these have been accelerating in frequency and intensity.
Today's episode was more severe than all previous, subjective
intensity [**2119-8-15**].
.
On ROS the patient has had increasing pedal edema in the past
week, and weight that "fluctuates" with no consistent gain in
weight. He has also had a one day history of hemoptysis.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for overnight management.  This
AM ([**7-16**]) he was hypotensive and found to have a rising troponin
(0.24 from 0.07).  He was taken for urgent catheterization,
found to have severe pulmonary hypertension, and an occluded
saphenous vein graft to OM2 that was successfully stented.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Planned intervention of SVG-OM1 bypass graft disease.
2. Normal central blood pressure.
3. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in mid-graft
in-stent

.
Chest CT [**2114-7-15**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Moderate emphysema particularly involving both upper lobes,
slightly more on the right than on the left.
3. Diffuse ground glass opacities in a bilaterally symmetric
pattern predominantly centrally and more on the dependent
aspects of the lungs. The findings are nonspecific. Given the
marked cardiomegaly, findings would be consistent with pulmonary
edema. Other considerations include diffuse infection or
hemorrhage. Please correlate clinically or with followup
evaluation.
4. Low density foci in both kidneys, with very limited
evaluation using this technique. Cross-sectional dedicated
evaluation as clinically indicated would provided further
characterization.

Chest x-ray [**7-15**]:Mild CHF with interstitial edema
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2114-7-16**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective limitted coronary angiography revealed native
severe thre
vessel disease as previously described. LIMA->LAD was patent but
there
was an LAD occlusion distal to the anastomosis. Native RCA
stents were
patent. SVG->OM1 that was previously patent was now occluded and
was
felt to be the culprit vessel.
2. Hemodynamic assessment revealed decreased systemic aortic
pressure
and tachycardia to the 120s. Right sided filling pressures and
Left
ventrucular filling pressures were highly elevated at 25 mm Hg
(mean
RAp) and 32 mm Hg (PCWP). There was severe pulmonary
hypertension with
systolic PAp of 90 mmHg. Cardiac index was severely depressed at
1.7
L/min/m2. This necessitated initiation of milrinone for
ionotropic
therapy, nitroglycerine and IV lasix for elevated filling
pressures and
pulmonary edema as well as insertion of IABP to unload the left
ventricle.
3. Left ventriculogram was deferred given renal failure and
hemodynamic
compromise.
4. Successful placement of 3.5 x 18 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in
SVG-OM2 as well as balloon inflation of the native OM2 using a
2.0 mm
balloon. Final angiography demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis,
no
angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow (See PTCA
Comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel disease.
2. Acute occlusion of SVG-OM1 graf
