Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
73 yoM w/ a h/o DM, recent h/o diabetic foot ulcer / osteo,
recent C diff infection, PUD, presenting following an arrest.
The patient called EMS on the day of admission not feeling well.
 EMS arrived and during transport the patient reportedly lost
his pulse, CPR was initiated, AED with "no shock advised" and
with CPR alone the patient regained his pulse prior to arriving
at the hospital.

Per the son the patient has been fatigued, dehydrated, having
persistent diarrhea which he states was unresponsive to the
flagyl he was taking, had decreased urine output for 4 days.  He
had decreased PO intake x 2 days and slight nausea.  No vomiting
but dry heaves x 1.  No abdominal pain, no chest pain, shortness
of breath.  No focal weakness.  No other complaints per son.
Also per the son the patient has a h/o ETOH abuse, but the
patient has told his son he has not drank for 60 days.  However,
the son states that he often lies about his drinking.

In the ER his initial VS were: T 100.2, HR 123, BP 145/93  RR 14
 O2 95%

The patient underwent an IJ placement and given 4L IVF.  He was
intubated and sedated.  He withdrew to painful stimuli.  Given
low GCS and reperfusion after arrest he was started on the
cooling protocol.  Guaiac negative in the ER.  Also given vanc,
levofloxacin and flagyl.

Of note the patient had a recent admission to the medicine floor
for recurrent C diff as well as VRE and coag negative staph
bacteremia (presumed PICC line infection).  His C diff was
treated with PO flagyl with a course to continue until [**2129-5-25**]
(as he would stop dapto for VRE on [**2129-5-18**].  His VRE had grown
from PICC line cultures (1/2 bottles) from [**2129-5-2**] and his PICC
line was pulled, he had no + peripheral blood cultures, he
started dapto on [**2129-5-5**].  In addition on [**5-3**] he had coag
negative staph from PICC line 1/4 bottles.  The patient was
discharged to rehab on [**5-6**], he stayed for 4 days and signed out
AMA.  He only rec'd 5 days of daptomycin IV.  He reportedly was
continuing to take his PO flagyl.

He left rehab facility against medical advice and states he
lives alone. Takes medications on his own with assistance of his

visiting nurse.  Patient has assistance from a woman who lives
upstairs in his building who checks in once a day.  Does not
speak with his son who was previously involved in his care.  Per

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY [**5-26**] back to MICU
============
73 yoM w/ a h/o PVD, DM, CAD and recent C diff presenting with
PEA arrest following 4 days of general malaise.

#. PEA arrest: Likely secondary to dehydration secondary to
severe clostridium difficile infection.  The patient had a
recent admission for c. diff and VRE / S epi bacteremia.   Hct
was stable. CTA was negative for PE.  MI was ruled out.  No
major electrolyte abnormalities.  The patient was initially
started on cooling protocol but then stopped as it was deemed
unnecessary.  Empiric daptomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, po
vancomcyin, IV flaygl were started.  The patient was cultured
and lactate trended. He improved and it was felt that this was
likely hypovolumeia that led to PEA arrest.  His daptomycin,
ciprofloxacin, cefepime were all discontinued.  He continued on
po vancomycin and IV flagyl for C. difficle infection.  He was
then transferred to the regular medical floor and continued on
oral Vancomycin and IV Flagyl with improvement in his diarrhea.

# NSTEMI: On [**5-25**] patient was noted to have an unresponsive
episode with normal hemodynamics at that time.  This was thought
to possibly be due to a seizure versue vaso-vagal syncope.
During this episode, and EKG was obtained that revealed new
T-wave inversions in his lateral leads.  Cardiac enzymes
revealed an elevated troponin I to 0.46.  Given his co-morbid
conditions, he was medically managed with beta blockade, aspirin
PR and high dose statin (though this was only partially
administered as patient developed swallowing difficulties).  He
was also transfused given his Hematocrit < 30 and evidence of
end organ ischemia.  Troponin remained stable and was trended
for 24 hours.  The following day, he was transferred to the MICU
in the setting of new onset hypotension to SBP 80s.  An Echo was
obtained [**5-26**] that revealed decreased EF = 10% and biventricular
dysfunction consistent with cardiogenic shock.

# Respiratory failure: Secondary to PEA arrest.  The patient was
intubated and ventilated.  He was rapidly weaned off the vent on
[**2129-5-22**].  He continued to do well s/p extubation.

# Oliguria / Renal failure: Patient was admitted with
hypotension after PEA arrest.  Also with chronic renal
insufficience with baseline Cr of 1.7.  After transfer from the
MICU [**5-24**], patient was noted to have minimal urine output,
approximately 10cc/hr
