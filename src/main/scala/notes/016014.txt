CNIS [**3-30**]: Mild plaques involving left common carotid artery,
bilateral proximal internal carotid arteries with an estimated
percentage of stenosis less than 40%
Echo [**3-30**]: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>65%). There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Echo [**4-7**]: POST CPB: Preserved biventricular function. Bileaflet
mechanical prosthesis identified in aortic posiiton. Well seated
and stable with good leaflet excursion. Mild aortic
regurgitation. No other change in valve structure or function.
CXR [**4-8**]: No pneumothorax status post removal of left-sided
chest tube. Developing left basilar process, probable
atelectasis

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, patient was transferred from OSH for
management of her Aortic Stenosis. Prior to surgery patient had
a full work-up including echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound and
dental consult. Her Coumadin was discontinued and Heparin
initiated. On hospital day six she underwent dental extraction.
She was then brought to the operating room on [**4-7**] where she
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve.
Please see op note for surgical details. Patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition on minimal inotropic support. Patient was weaned off
of sedation and awoke neurologically intact and was extubated on
post-op day one. All inotropes were weaned off on this day and
she was transferred to the cardiac surgery step-down unit.
Coumadin was started on post-op day two, diuretics and b
blockers were started and her chest tubes were removed. She was
gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Epicardial pacing
wires removed on post op day three. Physical therapy worked with
patient for post-op mobility and strength. Patient made a good
recovery without post-operative complications and was at level 5
on post-op day five. Her labs and physical exam were stable. She
was discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate
follow-up appointments.
