Brief Hospital Course:
# Community Acquired Pneumonia/Sepsis/Respiratory failure:
Initially admitted to the ICU, as was transferred intubated.
Treated with IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Improved rapidly and extubated, transferred to the floor on the
hospital medicine team.  He was transitioned to oral
antibiotics, weaned off oxygen and continued to do well.  He
showed no overt evidence of aspiration, but did not undergo a
formal swallow evaluation because of the holiday weekend and his
eagerness for discharge.  He was advised to discuss a barium
swallow with his primary physician and schedule an evaluation at
his/her discretion.  His recurrent pneumonia may be related to
his underlying lung disease rather than aspiration.  He will
finish a total of 14 days of antibiotics, discharged on
cefpodoxime and azithromycin.  His sputum culture, urinary
legionella antigen and blood cultures were negative for a
source.
