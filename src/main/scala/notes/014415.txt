CXR: Cardiac enlargement with mild congestive heart failure.
CTA: 1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis. A consolidation in the left lower lobe cannot be
excluded.
3. Small pulmonary nodules seen on the prior study are not
visualized on the current study.
CT Head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. No evidence of
infarction. Mild left maxillary sinus disease
ECG: 60 bpm, L axis, sinus, no st-tw changes


Brief Hospital Course:
Plan:
1. respiratory failure--initial thinking was pneumonia vs chf vs
central cause. unclear if pt is chronic [**Name (NI) 101557**] retainer; no hx
COPD. ABGs with pH 7.26 then 7.24 then 7.28 on bipap. No longer
on BiPAP.  CXR with LLL effusion vs consolidation vs
atelectasis, not significantly changed from old films (has had
pleural effusions consistently since [**2127**]). retrocardiac
density. R base with small effusion. CT without evidence of PE.
Pt was put on clinda temporarily.  By the time pt was
transferred to floor, respiratory status had stabilized and pt
required about 1-2L O2 by NC with good O2 sats.

2. hypernatremia--Na on presentation 154. Given NS to rehydrate,
as initially thought to have hypovolemic hypernatremia given
limited diet, NH residence, limited ability feed himself, on
lasix 40mg daily at baseline. On prior admissions has had sodium
of 145 but not as high as 154.  Free water flushes were given
through the NG tube, and his sodium came down to 148, then 141.


3. mental status change--seen by neuro in the EW. Unclear if L
sided weakness is worse as can't cooperate w/full neuro exam.
Head CT neg; no anticoagulation per neuro recs. Would have
needed intubation to obtain MRI; not done per neuro.  Systolic
BP was kept around 150 initially with concern of stroke.  Mental
status continued to improve on transfer to the floor, and pt was
somewhat responsive and somewhat able to follow commands.  Pt's
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**], notes that this is still far from his
baseline, when he was able to communicate somewhat.

4. CHF--systolic and diastolic. CXR without evidence significant
failure. Stable for now.  Pt was diuresed with lasix; lungs
remained clear with no increase in O2 requirement.  Weights were
measured but difficult to interpret as different numbers of bed
clothes/sheets/pillows were on the bed each morning.

5. DM--takes glyburide at baseline. Covered with insulin scale,
qid checks and dosing of humalog (correction doses). QID
fingersticks were continued, which showed good glucose control.
On addition of NG tube feeds, NPH insulin was given at 4 units
[**Hospital1 **], which resulted in good control of glucose, around 90s-130s.


6. bradycardia--pt bradys down to 30s-40s.  Likely has some AV
nodal dysfunction.  However, is asymptomatic and maintains his
BP adequately.  Telemetry was discontinued after discussion with
cardiology, as pt is not a candidate for a pacer.  Remained
asymptomatic with bradycardia, and actually was noted to have a
more normal pulse in the last few days prior to discharge.

7. HTN--BP kept slightly high initially given concern for CVA.
Was put back on lisinopril and titrated up; giving 40mg daily on
discharge.

8.  Nutrition - initially an NG tube was placed, and pt received
tube feeds with nutrition on consult for particular
recommendations.  Pt continued to pull out NG tube, and soft
restraints were placed to prevent this.  As pt's mental status
did not seem to improve substantially, and a speech/swallow
evaluation revealed that pt was aspirating anything placed in
his mouth, the family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
