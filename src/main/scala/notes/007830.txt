Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
sigmoid colectomy

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66yo F w/ recent LUL VATS wedge resection ([**3-26**]), stroke
([**3-26**]), and CAD s/p MI who presents w/ constipation and
abdominal pain for 2 weeks.  The patient notes that immediately
following the surgery, she developed lower abdominal pain, for
which she had been taking po dilaudid post-op, and she did not
have BM since.  She has been passing flatus.  Over the past few
days, she has been unable to keep down POs and has clear
vomitus--non-bloody, non-bilious.  She denies any fevers,
chills, night sweats, breathing complaints, urinary complaints.
No LE edema. She notes that the pain is the same in quality,
location, and severity since it began post-OP.
In the ED, her labs showed elevated WBC, and given her clinical
history, initially concerning for small bowel obstruction.
However, abdominal X-ray was not consistent with this diagnosis;
she had further evaluation with abd/pelvic CT.  This study
revealed mild inflammatory stranding of the sigmoid colon which
was suggestive of diverticulitis.  In addition, she had evidence
of UTI.  Given that the pt could not tolerate PO, she was
admitted for IV antibiotics and IVF.

40-pack-year smoking history, discontinued 7 years ago). She
admitted to occasional, social use of alcohol.  She denied use
of

Brief Hospital Course:
    Ms. [**Known lastname 10840**] was admitted to the medical service on [**2112-4-24**] with a diagnosis of diverticulitis.  She was initially
managed conservatively with bowel rest and IV antibiotics.  She
failed this treatment and required a sigmoid colectomy on
[**2112-4-28**].  Please refer to previously dictated operative note.
    Her post-operative course was quite difficult.  In the early
post-operative period she developed a myocardial infarction and
required treatment in the ICU.  She developed respiratory
failure during this time and required intubation and mechanical
ventillation.  During this time she began having high fevers.
Given her clinical appearence and her chest x-rays, she was
treated for pneumonia.  She repeatedly failed attempts to wean
from the ventillator.  After it was made evident that she would
require a prolonged intubation, a tracheostomy was recommended.
After many long discussions with her family and healthcare
proxy, it was determined thta this course of action was contrary
to her wishes.  On [**2112-5-23**], she was made CMO and expired
shortly after extubation.
