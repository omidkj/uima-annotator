Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
EGD
cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: The history is obtained
from the limited notes obtained from [**Hospital1 **] as the patient is
intubated and son not available. Per notes, poor historian but
developed intermittent CP and extreme sleepiness x 4 days. She
was brought in by a neighbor who sees her everyday and stated
she was sleeping more often than normal and complaining of the
intermittent pain, and had to be convinced to come in. Also
related SOB x 1 day and right leg pain. In the OSH ED the
patient was unable to rate her chest pain or locate it, and she
complained most of upper epigastric pain. No nausea,
diaphoresis. + lightheadedness. ED physcician spoke with son who
stated his mother had complained of increasing bowel movements
that were darker in color recently.
.
In ED at [**Hospital3 1280**], vitals 99, 111/59, 73% RA. Placed on face
mask and O2 sat increased to 89% on 15L. EKG demonstrated ST
depressions II, III, aVF, V3-V6, ST elevation in avR, V1, all
new when compared to prior on [**2112-12-13**]. Aspirin 324mg given and
heparin started. Guaiac negative. HCT was 21 and heparin was
stopped transiently but restarted prior to transfer. She was
transfused 2 units PRBCs. CXR showed CHF and given 20mg IV
lasix. She continued to be hypoxic on a face mask and due to
worsening SOB, she received 15 mg etomidate and 100 mg
succinylcholine and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure and started on propofol.
.
She initially came throught the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] but was taken
emergently to the cath lab where she was found to have 30%
ostial stenosis in left main, no significant disease in LAD, 30%
mid and distal LCx, 60-70% stenosis prox and mid RCA, and 90% in
PDA. No intervention performed d/t anemia and desire to avoid
anticoagulation.
.
On review of symptoms per [**Hospital1 **] note, she denied fever,
chills, sore throat, emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena,
hematochezia (different story from son). No hematuria, dysuria,
frequency, urgency, back pain, rashes, headache.

Cardiac cath [**2-14**]

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA has
a 30%
ostial stenosis. The LAD had no obstructive CAD. The LCX has a
40%
stenosis at the mid and distal LCx. The RCA has a 60-70% mid
stenosis
with a 90% stenosis at the mid PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated normal
systemic
arterial pressure of 126/58 mmHg.
3. No intervention was performed at this time due to the
patients
underlying active pneumonia and anemia with Hct 21%.
--------------------
TTE [**2-15**]

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). At least mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
------------------
carotid u/s [**2-17**]

FINDINGS: Minimal heterogeneous left-sided calcific plaque
involving the carotid bulb and extending into the internal
carotid artery. The peak systolic velocities, however, are
normal bilaterally. The ICA to CCA ratios are also unremarkable.
There is antegrade flow involving both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: No significant ICA or CCA stenosis involving either
the left or right carotid systems.
non contrast ct chest [**2-21**]

CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are mild to moderate
atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch and descending
aorta. Minimal calcification is seen within a normal caliber
ascending aorta medially (2:25). The aortic valve is moderately
calcified, as is the mitral annulus and coronary arteries.
Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for
enlargement. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. 3- mm
pulmonary nodules are seen within the right upper lobe (3:13)
and right middle lobe lateral segment (3:30). There is a small
area of focal bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe (3:13)
which may represent prior infection.

While not tailored for infradiaphragmatic evaluation, there is a
large partially rim- calcified cyst within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] of the
liver measuring 46 x 40 mm. A small hypodensity within the
segment II of the liver likely represents a cyst. There is a
small hiatal hernia, as well as small calcified splenic
granulomas.

There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderately calcified aortic valve and coronary arteries.
2. Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] criteria, if
there is no history of smoking or significant risk factors for
lung cancer, no further followup is needed. Otherwise, followup
with a dedicated chest CT in 12 months is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
# CAD/Ischemia

EKG changes and symptoms likely due to subendocardial ischemia
in the setting of poor oxygenation d/t severe anemia and
critical AS with no evidence of acute thrombus/STEMI or
significant left main disease requiring CABG. Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated mild diffuse disease with 90%
stenosis in PDA, no stent placed d/t anemia and wish to avoid
plavix without
