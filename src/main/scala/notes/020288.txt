Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and vaginal bleeding

Dilation and Curretage
IUD removal

13 units PRBC transfusion


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 54 yo F with a history of dysfunctional uterine
bleeding presents with increasing dyspnea. Patient was admitted
to GYN [**2076-11-24**] with uterine bleeding. A Mirena IUD was placed
with some difficulty and uterine tissue revealed uterine polyps.

Per patient the bleeding has continued and she has used [**4-9**] pads
daily since discharge. The bleeding was somewhat better after
the IUD placement, but started having clots and cramping again
in the last 3-4 days (both were severe prior to IUD placement).
With the continued bleeding she has began to feel more
symptomatic with dizziness and dyspnea on exertion. She reports
that the symptoms became significant approximately 4 days ago.
She denies any history of chest pain or dyspnea at rest. She
does have occasional palpitations similar to her previous
episodes of atrial fibrillation.
.
In the ED initial vitals were t 98.5 Hr 79 BP 139/52 RR 26 O2
100% 5L
She was seen by the OB/GYN consult resident who recommended
evaluation of the IUD placement. It was not seen on pelvic u/s
but pelvic CT showed proper placement of the IUD. Additionally
gyn recommended treatment with provera to allow Mirena IUD to
help decrease the bleeding. In the ED she received ativan 1 mg
IV, provera 20 mg PO and received 1 U PRBCs.
.
Currently she has back pain. It is a [**7-14**] and is located in her
lower back. It radiates to her legs but is not associated with
any weakness or incontenence.

pain, syncope, presyncope, dysuria, headache, blurry vision. Has

RADS:

US Pelvis [**2161-12-15**]: There is no hydronephrosis in either kidney.
 The endometrium measures 10 mm. The uterus measures 10.3 x 5.7
x 6.2 cm.  The right ovary is not definitely seen. Intrauterine
device is not definitely seen. Cystic structure measuring 3.7 x
3.0 cm is seen adjacent to the left adnexa, likely representing
paraovarian cyst. IMPRESSION: 1. IUD not definitely seen. 2.
Probable left paraovarian cyst. 3. Right ovary not seen.
.
CT Pelvis [**2161-12-15**]: Intrauterine device is present within the
uterus.There is left paraovarian cyst as seen on the ultrasound.
 The rectum and visualized sigmoid colon are unremarkable. There
is no free pelvic fluid. Urinary bladder is distended.
IMPRESSION: 1. Intrauterine device within the uterus. 2. Left
paraovarian cyst as seen on the ultrasound.
.
CXR [**2161-12-15**]: In comparison with the study of [**2161-8-14**], there is
little change. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
dilatation of pulmonary vessels persists.  No evidence of acute
focal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo F with h/o atrial fibrillation, uncontrolled diabetes
mellitus, morbid obesity, restrictive lung disease, with vaginal
bleeding s/p IUD placement on prior hospitalization, admitted
with symptomatic blood loss anemia, treated with blood
transfusions and Provera.

# Dysfunctional uterine bleeding: Bleeding likely secondary to
excess estrogen in the setting of high peripheral conversion. In
addition, INR supra therapeutic on Coumadin. On prior
hospitalization for DUB, the patient had suction D&C with
endometrial biopsy negative for cancer, as well as placement of
Mirena IUD for long-term control of bleeding. On presentation,
GYN service was consulted. The patient was initially admitted
the Medicine with GYN consult because of her complex medical
issues. CT pelvis confirmed IUD well placed. Provera 20mg PO
daily x10days was started on [**2161-12-15**]. The patient was
transfused 6 units of PRBC's without complication. The patient
was also maintained on iron supplementation and a bowel regimen.
The patient's HCT improved from 25.3 on admission to 31.7 prior
to 6th unit.

Patient continued to bleed heavily. She was transferred to the
GYN service. On [**2161-12-19**] patient was noted to have weakness,
dizziness, and lightheadedness. Patient became hypotensive to
103/57 with a heart rate of 95. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.
Hematocrit decreased from 31.7 to 22.6. Given the rapid
bleeding, decision was made to go to the operating room
emergently. Patient underwent a dilation and curettage and an
operative hysteroscopy with a polypectomy. The IUD was removed.
Please see the Operative note on [**2161-12-19**] for further detail. At
the time of this discharge, the pathology report is pending. The
surgery was uncomplicated. The patient received 2 units of blood
intraoperatively.

She was transferred to the ICU for continuous monitoring, and
received 4 more units in the ICU with the hematocrit improvement
to 28. Provera was also increased to 40mg PO daily. Vaginal
bleeding had improved dramatically. Patient was transferred to
the floor. However, the hematocrit trended down to 26, and she
received 1 more unit PRBC while on the floor. Follow up
hematocrits remained stable, increasing to 31.

In summary, patient received 6 units pre-operatively, and 7
units post-operatively. On discharge, she was no longer
bleeding, and hemodynamically stable.

# Mild Leukocytosis: On HD2, the patient's WBC increased to 12.4
and the patient had a low grade temperature of 100.1. The
patient had not received blood products in several hours. No
localizing symptoms. UA was negative. WBC decreased to 8.

# Dyspnea: The patient has restrictive lung disease with a home
O2 requirement. Symptoms of dyspnea likely secondary to blood
loss anemia. Chest x-ray was showed little change, without acute
focal pneumonia, though cardiac silhouette increased and
pulmonary vessels were dilated. Dyspnea was treated with O2 to
maintain sats and HCT correction with transfusions, Provera and
IUD as described above. If the patient remains dyspneic,
consider ECHO.

# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Currently the patient is
compensated. Lungs clear without signs of volume overload. Lasix
was continued. Beta-blocker was resumed the evening
