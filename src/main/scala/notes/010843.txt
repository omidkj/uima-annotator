HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2132-5-6**]. She underwent a
right BK [**Doctor Last Name **] to lateral peroneal artery bypass with right
saphenous vein, a fibular resection, angioscopy and valve
lysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition. The patient did
well postoperative and was transferred to the SICU for
continued monitoring and care. Postoperative day #1, there
were no overnight events. She was afebrile. Physical exam was
unremarkable. She had a dopplerable DP pulse. The patient did
require some Haldol intermittently overnight secondary to
mild confusion. The patient's fluids were Hep-locked. Her
diet was advanced as tolerated. She remained on bedrest and
in the VICU. The renal service followed the patient during
her hospitalization and managed her hemodialysis needs. The
patient was dialyzed every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Psychiatry was requested to see the patient for continued
delirium and they felt that the patient was delirious. This
was not  controlled with Haldol or Ativan. They are aware
that the patient has a history of delirium after major
surgical procedures. Usually this clears with holding
medications and giving Haldol. The patient was followed by
the ostomy  service for management of her ileostomy. The
patient's delirium resolved by postoperative day #4. The
remainder of her hospital course was unremarkable. The
patient was discharged to home in stable condition on [**2132-5-12**], postoperative day #6. The patient will be dialyzed
prior to being discharged to home.
