Pertinent Results:
Echo [**10-24**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild global dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinetic apex
and severely hypokinetic anteroseptal, anterior and inferior
wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Post-Bypass: Normal RV systolic function. Overall LVEF is 35-40%
on epinephrine infusion. Mild MR. Mild to moderate TR.
CXR [**10-31**]: Improving left pleural effusion and left lower lobe
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and was brought directly to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 4. Please see operative report for surgical details. Patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Patient required
multiple transfusions secondary to post-operative bleeding and
low HCT. He remained intubated overnight and on post-op day one
he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He required multiple inotropes for hemodynamic
support but was weaned from these by post-op day three.
Overnight on post-op day two he had episodes of atrial
fibrillation that required amiodarone. Beta blockers and
diuretics were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. On post-op day three he was transferred to the
SDU for continued care. Over the next several days he required
aggressive respiratory toilet and worked with physical therapy
for strength and mobility. He had another episode of atrial
fibrillation on post-op day five, which was treated and he will
go home on amiodarone. He was medically managed, with
medications titrated and electrolytes repleted. He was
eventually started on coumadin for post op paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.
He was started on vanco and levo for ? of LLE cellulitis. He was
seen in consultation by infectious diseases as well who
recommended continuing vanco and starting cipro. He was seen in
consultation by [**Last Name (un) **] who recommended Lantus insulin.
Wound care followed closesly for his LLE wounds which are
improving daily. He also continued with aggressive diuresis.He
was ready for discharge on [**11-10**].
