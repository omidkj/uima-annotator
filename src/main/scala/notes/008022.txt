Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, dry heaving, rectal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 41 yo F w/ PMHx of seizure d/o, chronic back pain,
partial gastrectomy, for obesity, who presented with vague hx of
intermittent nausea and dry heaving for 3-4 months, not
associated w/ abdominal pain, but associated with anorexia and
recently, over the past week with occasional fevers (to 102),
chills, weakness, fatigue. She admits to poor PO intake over
recent weeks, as well as occasional dizzyness when standing up
and a syncopal episode.
.
(Hx below from prior admission notes and verified during Pt
interview):
.
She has had a 25-30 pound wt loss over the past 2 months, as
well as leg and arm swelling. There was no recent travel,
unusual foods, sick contacts, or new pets. She also notes
constipation x3 mos leading to painful straining and bloody
stools, which was evaluated by flex sig at OSH showing
hemorrhoids. She was started on docusate and notes loose stools
lately associated with taking more laxatives.
.
Since admission, CT was done and showed pancolitis. GI was
consulted and did upper endoscopy which was normal. Colonoscopy
was aborted for poor prep. Two days ago, the patient developed
sharp chest pain radiating to her shoulders, no exertional
component, no change with inspiration or cough. She has had
dyspnea and chest pressure for the past week that has been
constant. Cardiac markers showed trop peak at 0.41 with CK/CKMB
normal and no EKG changes. Cards was consulted and felt this was
not an MI, maybe myocarditis, and requested TTE. This was done
today showing systolic and diastolic dysfunction (LVEF 20-30%)
with a small effusion and possible early tamponade.
.
During this admission, Pt has been persistently tachycardic
(100s to 120s) and this evening Pt was noted to have a HR
130s-140s.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2102-8-14**] RUQ ULTRASOUND:
1. Cholelithiasis without secondary signs to suggest
cholecystitis.
2. Echogenic liver most compatible with fatty infiltration.
Please note that other forms of hepatic disease such as
cirrhosis/fibrosis are not excluded.
.
[**2102-8-15**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Pancolitis as decribed above.
2. Cystic lesion in tail of pancreas, not fully evaluated on
this
examination. Would recommend MRI in 6 months for further
characterization.
3. Focal narrowing in sigmoid colon may represent focal
collapsed bowel,
however, bowel wall lesion cannot be excluded. Would recommend
imaging
correlation such as colonoscopy or barium study as available.
.
[**2102-8-16**] MRCP:
1. Severe hepatic steatosis.
2. Biliary tree shows no abnormalities.
3. Colonic wall thickening and mucosal enhancement, related to
colitis as
seen on recent CT scan.
4. Cystic, non-enhancing lesion in the tail of the pancreas,
that is most likely in keeping with a pseudocyst, however, a
side branch IPMN cannot be excluded, although less likely. A
followup MRI is suggested in six months for further evaluation.
5. Jejunal biopsy negative.
.
[**2102-8-17**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. No evidence of esophageal perforation.
2. Resolution of colonic wall thickening demonstrated on prior
CT.
3. Hepatic steatosis.
4. Low-attenuation lesion at the tail of the pancreas is
compatible with a cyst versus dilated side branch. It is
unchanged from prior recent MRCP and CT. As described on prior
MRCP report, followup of this with MRCP in six months is
recommended to assess for expected stability.
.
[**2102-8-18**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small to moderate
sized pericardial effusion. No right atrial or right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen. However, the right ventricle appears
underfilled.
IMPRESSION: severe anterior and apical hypokinesis/akinesis;
small, primari8ly anterior pericardial effusion possibly with
early tamponade.
