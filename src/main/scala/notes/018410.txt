HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 37 year-old woman with
no known past medical history who presents to the Emergency
Room with three day history of fever, generalized myalgias
and ten hour history of cough and progressive shortness of
breath.  The patient was in her usual state of health until
three days prior to admission when she experienced fevers and
generalized myalgias on the night prior to admission.  The
patient has an onset of cough that was unproductive and
progressively worse with progressive shortness of breath at
rest.  The patient reports that her daughter had been sick
with a upper respiratory infection and otitis media on the
week prior to admission and her husband had a fever and sore
throat three days prior to admission.  The patient denies
recent travel.  Took Advil and Tylenol with no decrease in
temperature.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband and three
children.  She is a housewife.  No smoking.  Social alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the MICU the patient's temperature
is 100.3.  Blood pressure 80 to 90s/40s.  Pulse was 130s.
The patient was sating 100% on a nonrebreather.  The patient
was awake, alert, speaking in full sentences slightly
dyspneic.  No accessory muscle usage for respiration.  The
patient was tachypneic.  The patient was tachycardic with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs were scattered rhonchi right
greater then left no wheezes, crackles or egophony.  The
patient had no edema and 2+ capillary refill.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count was 20.8, hematocrit
35.3, platelets 177, 92 neutrophils, 6 bands, 1 lymphocytes,
1% monocytes.  Mean corpuscular volume was 64, RDW 143,
sodium 139, potassium 3.4, chloride 97, bicarb 22, BUN 10,
creatinine .7, glucose 69, gap 15, PT 17.5, INR 2.0, PTT
33.7, fibrinogen 555, lactate was 3.3 with an arterial blood
gas of 7.4, 3, 31 and 124 respectively.  Blood cultures were
negative.  Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia with [**Street Address(2) 28585**] depression in V4 through V5 thought to be related to the
rate.  Urinalysis was negative.  Blood cultures showed no
growth.  Urine cultures showed no growth.  Legionella urinary
antigen was negative.  Chest x-ray revealed multifocal
opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  CTA revealed
no pulmonary embolus, multifocal pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Multilobar pneumonia:  The patient was
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics to treat what was
thought to be a community acquired pneumonia.  The patient
received Vancomycin to cover resistant strep pneumonia and
Levaquin to cover gram positive gram negative atypicals and
Legionella.  The patient's sputum studies were negative for
influenza, Legionella and the patient's sputum did not grow
out any suspicious pathogens in the sputum sample.  There was
no predominance of respiratory pathogens, however, there was
greater then 10 epithelials and this was a poor sample.  The
patient improved gradually with supplemental oxygen by face
mask and a trial of CPAP, which was successful in temporizing
the patient's respiratory status and avoiding intubation.
The patient's respiratory status improved to the point where
she no longer needed MICU care.  The patient was transferred
to the floor on the [**9-19**] at which point she was
taken off Vancomycin and continued on Levaquin as the patient
had no evidence of resistant gram positive organisms 48 hours
after the initiation of Vancomycin.  The patient was
discharged to home on the [**9-23**] with discontinuation
of oxygen, complete improvement in dyspnea on exertion and
resolution of the patient's fever, which had reached as high
as 103 degrees during her hospitalization.

Upon further review of the patient it was discovered the
patient has a known history of thalassemia trait with
possible iron deficiency superimposed, which was the likely
etiology of the patient's microcytic anemia.  The patient was
encouraged to pursue iron supplementation with repeat iron
studies at a future date, however, further workup of her
known thalassemia trait is not necessary.  It is unclear if
the patient's history of thalassemia trait has anything to do
with her current infection.  Patient's with thalassemia trait
are usual immunologically competent with minimal symptoms
from there thalassemia.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin 500 mg po q day to complete
a 14 day course.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Community acquired pneumonia.
2.  Respiratory distress.
3.  Anemia microcytic.
4.  Thalassemia trait.
