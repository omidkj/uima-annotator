Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
transfered from OSH for medical management of AMI and other
multiple medical problems.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right knee incision and drainage (bursa washout)

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a poor historian. The following history is taken from
the notes and from the patient.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 yo M who is transferred from an OSH s/p fall
at home. He was brought by EMS to the OSH. He was found awake
and alert but on the ground complaining of weakness and fatigue.
Per patient, he just couldn't get up. No LOC or hitting his
head. No loss of bowel or bladder function. He was brought to
the OSH and was found to have an elevated WBC, Cr 4.8, and
slightly elevated troponin I on admission. Subsequent troponins
continued to rise with a max of 4.7 and he was started on a
heparin gtt. He was also found to be fluid overloaded and with
ascities. He received a paracentesis with removal of 5L and
dialysis (per his home schedule on T, TH, Sa). During the course
of his hospitalization, he developed what was thought to be a
gout flare in his right knee. He has received most of his
medical care at [**Hospital1 18**] in the past and was transferred here for
further medical management.
.
On ROS he denies current SOB, CP, n/v, f/c, diarrhea. He makes
very little urine on his own. He describes pain in his right
knee which has improved slightly from yesterday. He denies any
current lightheadedness, HA, changes in vision, cough,
palpitations, or abdominal pain.

General: Pleasant obese male lying in bed in NAD
Skin: several open sores on arms with dirty fingernails. PVD
skin changes with bilateral lower extremities
HEENT: NCAT, anicteral sclera, injected conjunctiva bilaterally,
left pupil reactive to light. Right pupil less reactive- pt says
he had recent cataract surgery in that eye. Could not assess JVD
given body habitus, no cervical LAD appreciated.
CV: distant heart sounds, but RRR with 2/6 systolic murmur heard
best at LUSB without radiation.
Lungs: bibasilar crackles; distant breath sounds at the right
base. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi
Abdomen: distended but still soft. +BS, non-tender to palpation.
+ascities.
Extremities: very trace edema on left lower extremity.
peripheral vascular disease skin changes with erythema
bilaterally. Right knee with suprapatellar 3+ edema and beefy
red erythema extending past patella. Warm and mildly tender to
touch. ROM not fully tested secondary to discomfort.


Pertinent Results:
Labs on transfer from OSH: WBC 6.9 with 93.5%PMNs, 22% bands,
6%metamyelocytes, 1 nucleated RBC, Hgb 12.7, Plts 101, PTT 67 on
heparin gtt of 600 units, sodium 134, potassium 4, chloride 99,
CO2 18. BUN 38, Cr. 4.7, BS 117. Ammonia level elevated at 61,
BNP 1242, vanco level [**2100-12-1**] was 5

Studies from OSH:
[**2100-11-29**]: CXR 2 views: no pneumonia. Cardiomegaly. Pacemaker
inplace. no evidence of CHF. Small pleural effusion on lateral
view.
.
[**2100-11-30**]: U/S guided paracentesis: removal of 5100 mL fluid with
270 WBC, with 14%PMNs, 24% L, 60% monocytes, 10,000 RBC

ECHO (per d/c summary from OSH- no actually report with transfer
papers) showed poor LV function with an EF of 30-35%.

Labs from [**Hospital1 18**]:

Micro:  staph aurea from prepatellar bursa x3

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M with multiple medical problems including RV dysplasia
leading to right heart failure and chronic hepatic congestion,
ESRD requiring dialysis, DM2 and an AMI.
.
#AMI: patient was asymptomatic but was found to have largely
elevated troponins at the OSH.  He does have ESRD which
obviously affects the troponin clearence in the blood.  He was
continued on a heparin gtt originially on admission.  This is
was stopped secondary to bleeding.  Unsure about appropriate
medical regimen given his extensive history and RV dysplasia.
Has tried BB in past but had symptomatic hypotension from it.
Likely no statin given his liver function. Not on an ACEI
currently. Has h/o GI bleed- so careful with anticoagulation.
Probably reason he is not on ASA. While in the hospital an ASA
was started.
.
#h/o multiple arrhythmias: s/p multiple ablations. pacer in
place. EP consult in AM to evaluate pacer and found it to be
functioning well.
.
#PAF: Continued his home amiodarone and was monitored on
telemetry.  The issue of anticoagulation is discussed above.
.
#DM2: patient not on medications on transfer. Will start with
humalog sliding scale and add standing insulin based on 24 hour
usage.  His fingersticks were monitored and found to always be
within the 100-150 range qAC.  He was placed on an insulin SS
with humalog but did not require any use of insulin.
.
#ESRD: requires dialysis T, TH, SA.  The renal fellow was
notified and made recommendations regarding his nephrocaps and
phoslo and calcitriol.  He underwent dialysis as schedule.
.
#Chronic hepatic congestion: requires paracentesis twice a week.
 He was monitored closely and a therapeutic paracentesis was
performed on [**2100-12-6**].
.
#Right-sided and left-sided heart failure: from RV dysplasia.
He was placed on a 1L fluid restriction and a CXR on admission
showed no evidence of fluid overload.  As above, he was
monitored for ascites build up.
.
#erythematous right knee: considered gout flare at OSH given
this is a recurrent site for him. Given WBC and diff with bands
and metamyl, concern for cellulitis. Patient received vancomycin
at OSH. Continued allopurinol and stopped colchicine secondary
renal insufficiency.  Rheumatology was consulted and tapped his
pre-patellar bursa three times to remove fluid.  It grew out
Staph aureas which was MSSA.  Vancomycin was changed to
nafcillin.  Ortho was consulted for concern over a septic joint.
 Despite pain in his knee, the patient was able to ambulate on
the joint and it was believed the infection was not in the joint
itself.  Ortho did decided to take him to surgery for a wash out
procedure.  During the procedure he developed hypotension which
continued in the PACU.  He was transferred to the CCU. He never
recovered from the procedure and e
