History of Present Illness:
75 yo Mandarin speaking female with h/o afib not on
coumadin, HTN, asthma who presents s/p fall.  She got in a
heated
argument with a family member, then collapsed to the ground,
falling towards the left, at approximately 7pm, witness by her
daughter.  She appeared to have a  left facial droop, left sided
weakness and was "confused" per daughter.  She was transported
to
the [**Hospital1 18**].  Head CT was obtained, found to have a right MCA
occlusion, no hemorrhage.  Given t-[**MD Number(3) 7057**] ED at [**2125**] on
[**2109-8-13**].  The patient was unable to control secretions, so she
was intubated in the ED with the family's permission.  Started
on
a labetolol gtt for BP control as her SBP was 190.

ROS (per family prior to this episode):  negative for fevers,
chills, CP, SOB, rare asthma flares per family abdominal pain,
no BRBPR.  No history of strokes or Mis.


Past Medical History:
HTN
Atrial fibrillation (not taking coumadin per patient's wish to
not have multiple blood draws)
Asthma


Social History:
lives with her daughter, is separated from her husband, has
7 children, no current tobacco use but smoked 30 yrs ago, no
etoh, no drugs, no alternative medications


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
EXAM:  vitals:  BP 200/100, HR 88  (afib), O2 sat 93-99% on RA
GEN:  drooling from left side of mouth
HEENT:  NC/AT, no carotid bruits
CHEST:  CTA bilaterally
CV:  irreg irreg rhythm without murmur
ABD:  soft, NT, + BS
EXTREM:  left forearm hematoma 6x5cm, radial and DP pulses 2+
bilaterally, no edema

NEURO:
MS:  moves eyelids in response to voice but is nonverbal,
responds to pain (see sensory section below), not following
commands for me
CN:  pupils irregular bilaterally 2->1.5 mm bilaterally with
light, eyes deviated to the right however DO cross the midline
by
moving head.  + corneal reflex bilaterally.  Left face droop
with
drooling prior to intubation.
Motor:  Nl bulk.  Increased tone in the right arm. Flacid left
arm and leg. Minimal spontaneous movement of the right arm, more
so of the right leg.  No movement of the left arm or leg.
DTRs:  0 on left arm, left leg, right arm.  2 on right leg.
toes
up on the left, down on the right.
SENSORY:  extensor response left arm to pain, o/w withdrawls
from
pain in all other extremities.
[**Last Name (un) 7058**] and GAIT: unable to assess

Neuro exam upon discharge:
MS:  awake, alert, follows commands, left neglect
CN:  right gaze preference but does cross the midline, left
lower face droop, dysarthria
Motor:  Left arm/leg hemiplegia, flacid

Pertinent Results:
[**2109-8-14**] CT of head s/p t-PA:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Interval development of large infarction in the right middle
cerebral artery territory.
3. Evidence of thrombosis in the right middle cerebral artery.

[**2109-8-14**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**1-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**2109-8-14**] Carotid US:  1. No significant ICA stenosis within the
area of interrogation (cervical carotid region). Waveforms on
the right suggest a high-grade right ICA stenosis or occlusion
distal to the area of interrogation (intracranial).

Plain films of the left arm and hip:  no fracture

LUE US:  no clot

[**2109-8-14**] EEG:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of
mixed delta and theta frequency slowing in the right
temporo-parietal region and a slow,disorganizedbackground. This
suggests the a subcortical abnormality involving the right
hemisphere. The slow background frequency indicates an
encephalopathy. No epileptiform features were seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F with h/o afib, not on coumadin, and HTN. S/P large right
MCA stroke, given t-PA.  Observed in the ICU.  Transferred to
the floor.

1. s/p right mca occlusion stroke and t-pa:
Her exam is impressive for left sided neglect, left arm and leg
flacid paralysis.  Likely from an embolus from afib. Her goal
SBP was 140-160.  She was started on ASA 81, statin, and with
the family's permission coumadin (after Jtube was placed.)
Carotid US shows possible distal right ICA occlusion.  TTE shows
EF >65%, bilat atrial dilation, mild AS, [**1-25**]+ AI, 1+ MR, 2+ TR.
EEG upon admission was negative for signs of seizure activity.

2. CV: She was ruled out for MI and her atrial fibrillation was
rate controlled with diltiazem.  * NOTE:  she became wheezy
after each dose of metoprolol (2 doses given total in the ICU).*


3. Hematomas on left arm and left hip s/p fall prior to
admission:
Plain films showed no fractures in hips, no fractures or
dislocations in elbow/radius/ulna, no effusions.  LUE US neg for
clot.  Arm was treated with elevation.

4. Anemia: Hct 40->28 s/p t-PA.  No obvious source of bleed.
Received a blood transfusion on [**2109-8-15**] and hct stabilized.

5. Respiratory: She was extubated the day after admission.  MDIs
prn for h/o asthma.
NOTE:  gets wheezy with metoprolol.

6. She spiked a fever and she was pancultured.  UA looked
suspcious for UTI thus she was started on levofloxacin on [**8-16**].
She should complete a 7 day course.  Sputum, blood Cx were
followed. CXR was clear.

FEN: She failed a swallow eval, thus she underwent percutaneous
g/j-tube placement by IR on [**2109-8-19**] without complications.
