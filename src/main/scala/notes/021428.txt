Chief Complaint:
chest pain, dyspnea

none

History of Present Illness:
41 yo male w/ h/o squamous cell cancer involving right jaw s/p
resection and remission p/w saddle pulmonary embolism. One week
PTA pt was found to have left lower extremity dvt involving the
greater saphenous vein. He was not anticoagulated at that time.
Three days prior to admission, he began to have upper abdominal
or lower chest pain. Earlier today, he presented to an OSH with
chest pain and dyspnea. He was found to have a saddle pulmonary
embolism, started on iv heparin gtt, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further managment. Also at the OSH, a triple lumen CVC was
placed via IR guidance. He was bolused heparin and started on
gtt. Guaiac reportedly negative. Reportedly had Troponin I 0.52.

cta chest osh ([**Hospital3 **])
extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, incluing a saddle embolus
at main pulmonary artery bifurcation. Predominate clot burden is
within the lower segmental and subsegmental branches.

EKG:  sinus 99bpm, na, ni; no lad, right heart strain indicated
by twi in v1-v3. q1s3t3

ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

RUQ U/S: Technically limited study due to extensive overlying
bowel gas.

Bilateral LENI: Partially occlusive deep venous thrombosis of
the left deep femoral and popliteal veins.

CT Head: Normal study.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo male w/ h/o squamous cell cancer involving right jaw s/p
resection and remission p/w saddle pulmonary embolism and LLE
DVT.

#Saddle Pulmonary Embolism: Causes included immobility and
malignancy. There was  no  acute indication for thrombolysis.
The patient had signs of right heart [**Last Name (un) **] on EKG and mild
troponin increase.  He was howeever hemodynamically stable and
was able to walk for 5 min without oxygen desaturation or
tachycardia. Heparin drip was started and hew as transitioned to
lovenox. Echo revealed right heart strain but not failure.
During his hospitalization he was evaluated with head CT to rule
out intracranial metastases given history of squamous cell
cancer given initiation of anticoagulation.  A brief malignancy
workup was initiated given with RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for
liver mets which was a limited study and liver could not be
properly evaluated.  AFP was 2.0.  He understands that a full
malignancy workup will need to be completed as outpatient,
notably follow up with his ENT as scheduled for his squamous
cell carcinoma.  He will require a repeat ECHO in six weeks to
ensure improvement of right heart function.

Lovenox was chosen as method of anticoagulation due to concern
for recurrent nausea and vomiting as well as possible further
treatment for HCV and unknown status of malignancy.  He was
discharged with an rx for 10 day supply and an additional 30 day
supply which could be obtained after processing of prior
authorization which was completed by medical team.

Lastly, his nausea and vomiting which had been thought too be
secondary to his Hep C medications continued through his
hospitalization.  There was some thought that this was related
to constipation.  Though evaluation with EGD and other means
should be strongly considered if symptoms don't resolve in the
1-2 weeks. His symptoms temporarily did subside after bowel
movement on day of discharge and he was tolerating a regular
diet.

He was continued on his chronic pain medications and zoloft.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- malignancy workup including ENT follow up
- ensure pt taking lovenox and is covered by mass health
- is no resolution of nausea/vomiting, this will require further
workup
- repeat echocardiogram in 6 weeks.
