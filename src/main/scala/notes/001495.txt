CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year-old
female with a history of multiple medical problems and severe
emphysema/COPD as well as peripheral vascular disease who had
morning.  It was severe, sharp stabbing pain that is in the
center of the back below in the infrascapular area.  The
patient denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or chest
pain.  The pain is unchanged in character since it started.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, peripheral vascular
disease, status post multiple foot ulcers and multiple
post appendectomy, status post C section times three, former
alcoholic, anxiety, ? Diagnosis of diabetes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Paxil.  The patient does report
taking a blood pressure medication, but she cannot recall
what medication that was.

ALLERGIES:  Prednisone causes pneumonia.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.  States that her mother is
in her 90s and alive in [**State 1727**].  Her health care proxy is
daughter [**Name (NI) 2808**] who lives in [**Location 479**] [**Location (un) 1514**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient currently smokes one pack per
day.  She has been smoking for a very long time and was a
much heavier smoker in the past.  She does have a history of
alcoholism, but she states she quit after her hip surgery and
is unable to recall the date of the surgery.  She lives by
herself.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reports fifteen pound weight loss from 90
to 75 pounds during the last month.  She drinks large amounts
and urinates large amounts including wetting bed at night.
She walks with a walker and sometimes in a wheel chair.  She
reports no chest pain or shortness of breath, but her
mobility is very limited by COPD.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 168/87.
Pulse 72.  Respiratory rate 14.  O2 sat 91% on 4 liters nasal
cannula.  In general, the patient was an elderly ill
appearing female.  HEENT was very dry.  Chest clear to
auscultation anteriorly, but breath sounds were distant.
Heart had distant heart sounds.  Regular rate and rhythm.  No
murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with good
bowel sounds.  Extremities showed thin, brown discoloration
of lower half of calf.  No palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.
Feet without ulcers.  Pulses were dopplerable.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.5
with a differential of 92% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes, 2
monocytes.  Hematocrit was 34.1, platelet count 476, PT 12.7,
PTT 27, INR 1.1.  Chem 7 sodium 134, potassium 3.9, chloride
102, bicarb 26, BUN 10, creatinine 0.4, glucose 284.

IMAGING:  1.  Chest CT showed ascending aorta aneurysmally
dilated and measuring 5 cm.  The descending aorta had a
normal caliber and intrathoracic diameter measuring 2.5 to 3
cm.  However, there was a low attenuation rim around the
descending aorta starting from the aortic arch to about 2 cm
above the origin of the renal arteries.  It was
circumferential and was low attenuation most likely
corresponding to old hemorrhage.  There was a focal area of
extravasation from the posterior aorta at about 5 cm distal
from the left subclavian artery origin.  No frank intimal
flap was identified.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  In summary, the patient is a 70 year-old
female with a history of severe emphysema/COPD,  peripheral
vascular disease, tobacco use who presents with sharp back pain
and was found on CT to have evidence of aortic dissection with
possible oblique aneurysm extending into soft tissue. Myocardial
infarction was r/o.

During this hospitalization the patient's clinical problems
included:

1.  Aortic dissection:  After extensive discussion with the
family, in consideration of the patients over all health
especially the limitations of her lung disease, the decision was
made to proceed with medical management of the aortic dissection
since the patient was a very poor surgical candidate due to her
age and compromised pulmonary status, malnutrition.  The patient
was initially started on Esmolol and nitroprusside drips with
resolved systolic blood pressure around 100.  She tolerated the
blood pressure control well and was converted from the drips to
Metoprolol 100 mg po t.i.d., Hydralazine 10 mg po q.i.d., and
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po q.d.  Following her transfer
to the regular medicine floor the patient's hydralazine was
titrated to 25 mg q.i.d. and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.a.m.
for better blood pressure control.  Her goal blood pressure
is below 120s.  After initial drop of her hematocrit from 34
to 27 with hydration the patient's hematocrit remained stable
in the low 30s.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was
maintained on Albuterol inhaler and Atrovent inhaler was
added.  She required supplemental oxygen.  On repeat chest
x-ray she was found to have pneumonia.  In the setting of low
grade fevers as well as sputum production, the patient was
started on Levaquin.  The sputum grew penicillin-sensitive
strep pneumo and the patient's antibiotics were switched to
Amoxicillin.

3.  During this hospitalization her sugars remained in normal
range.

4.  Code:  DNR/DNI confirmed with the health care proxy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Aortic dissection managed medically.
4.  Emphysema

5.  Peripheral vascular disease status post multiple foot
ulcers and multiple hospitalization.
6.  Status post left hip replacement, status post
appendectomy, status post C section times three.
7.  Former alcoholic.
8.  Anxiety.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po q.a.m.,
Hydralazine 25 mg po q.i.d., Metoprolol 100 mg po t.i.d.,
Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn, Albuterol one to two
puffs q 4 to 6 prn, Atrovent two puffs q.i.d., amoxicillin
500 mg po q 6 hours for an additional six days, Protonix 40
mg po q.d., Trazodone 50 mg po q.h.s., Colace 100 mg po
b.i.d., Dulcolax 10 mg po prn, Paxil.
