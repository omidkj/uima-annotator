Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular Venous line
Right Radial arterial line

History of Present Illness:
55 year-old female resident of [**Hospital **] Rehab for several months
with a history of COPD with baseline O2 requirement of 2-4L, who
presents with respiratory distress, tachycardia and hypotension.
The patient has had numerous admissions to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure requiring
non-invasive respiratory support and occasional intubation.  In
[**4-1**] she underwent respiratory distress requiring prolonged
intubation.  She has had 6 subsequent admission for respiratory
failure and A-fib/MAT, last admission [**8-8**].  The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] from [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-9**] for tachycardia.
 She was was started on a cardizem gtt, loaded with digoxin and
admitted to the ICU. She remained in MAT/a-flutter throughout
her admission. She was r/o for MI and ECHO showed EF 65%,
moderate TR and moderate pulm hypertension. She was continued on
digoxin, cardiazem and lopressor.  She was also started on
lovenox for a-flutter, but was stopped due to extensive
bruising.
.
As far as her respiratory status she was initially BiPAP
dependent. This AM she desated to 70's on BiPAP. Her ABG on
BiPAP was 7.37/81/75, however off the BiPAP her gas was
7.29/96/62.  She was subsequently intubated.  Her CXR was
reportly clear, but [**2165-8-11**] Pseudomonas was grown in her sputum.
 She has a history of highly resistant. She was initially
treated with Aztreonam, but was switch to Amikacin because she
grew proteus in her urine.  She was also on solumedrol 40mg q12.
.
During transport she was reportly hypotensive to the SBP 70's
and tachycardic to the 130-150's.  She was given 150cc if IVF on
route. On arrive the patient was tachycardic with rates ranging
in the 140-170's.  She was minimally responsive and BP was
initally difficult to assess.  Her pressures via cuff ranged SBP
60-80's.  She was started on levophed, amio gtt, and aggressive
IVF.  Her rates remined 120's-140's and BP were in the SBP
80-100's.  She had an emergent femoral line placed (left) and
radial a-line were placed.

Chronic aspiration

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to ICU on [**8-16**], pt was in septic shock with
hypotension, increasing O2 requirement and decreasing urine
output.  Pt had a CVL and aline placed, cultures were sent, she
was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressively
resuscitated with fluids without significant improvement in BP.
She remained febrile and tachycardic to 150s with a multi focal
atrial tachycardia/aflutter.  She was pressor dependant on
Levo/Neo to maintain a MAP of 65.  Alternative pressor regimens
were attempted to limit tachycardia and still maintain MAPs
though it was very difficult to control the fast heart rates
even after an amiodarone load.  Over the following days, she
became oliguric and her urine sediment showed muddy casts
consistent with ATN.  Liver function tests were rising showing
evidence of shock liver and she was unable to weaned from
pressors (Levo and Vasopressin).  Family meetings took place
each day to discuss progression of illness and poor prognosis.
Both blood and sputum cultures returned positive for a
multi-drug resistent pseudomonas and an proteus species was
found in the urine culture.  Infectious disease was consulted
and antibiotics were broadened to include amikacin & colistin
for double coverage of pseudomonas.  Pt had baseline severe COPD
and pulm hypertension, these further complicated oxygenation and
ventilation.  After she received initial fluid resuscitation,
she developped bilateral consolidations likely due to effusions
though also complicated by underlying pseudomonas PNA.  She was
requiring significant support from the vent (100% FiO2 and
PEEPs> 14) to maintain adequate oxygen saturations and had
persistent metabolic acidosis due to Lactates in the 5-6 range.
 Pt was receiving very little sedation and was noted to have
minimal response to stimulation.   Pt was initiated on CVVH in
an attempt to improve acidosis and remove fluid in order to
improve oxygenation.  She had some transiently decreased PEEP
requirement though she was unable to weaned successfully from
100% oxygen.  After two days of CVVH,  she had persistent lactic
acidosis, ongoing septic shock without any ability to wean from
pressors or full vent support and the family decided to change
code status to DNR.  That evening, she became progressively
acidotic, hypotensive and difficult to oxygenate.  The family
was brought in to the bedside and decision was made to provide
comfort measures.    Pt expired on the evening of [**2165-8-16**] from
multiorgan failure and septic shock, family declined autopsy.
