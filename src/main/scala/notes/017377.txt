History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year old woman with a history of rheumatic fever,
COPD, and gastric ulcer who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with
chest pain. The pain started at around 3pm while she was sitting
at rest. She first noticed bilaterally arm pain, along with
substernal chest pressure. There was no associated SOB, N/V, or
diaphoresis. She has never had chest pain like this before.
.
She went to the ED at [**Hospital3 4107**], where she received SL NTG
x3 which helped the pain somewhat but did not relieve it
completely. EKG at the OSH showed aflutter with a rate in the
70s, with 1-1.5mm ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF. At
the OSH she also received asa, metoprolol 5mg IV x1, lipitor
80mg, plavix 300mg, and heparin and integrillin gtt were
started. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
.
In the cath lab here, she was found to have a 50% mid-RCA
lesions as well as [**2-13**]+MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] further intervention was done.
.
Of note, she had a recent admission to S. [**Hospital **] hospital for
SOB, and she was treated for a COPD flare. On that admission she
was also told that she had a "leaky valve."
.
Currently, she denies CP/SOB, cough, F/C, abd pain, diarrhea.
She does complain of nausea.

She was transferred to the SICU in critical but stable condition
on dobutamine and propofol drips. She was extubated  and weaned
from her vasoactive drips the same day. She received 2 units
PRBCs for a HCT of 24. She was bolused with amiodarone and
started on a amiodarone drip as well as coumadin  for her atrial

started on heparin for her mechanical valve while her INR was
subtherapeutic. She received an additional unit of PRBCs for an
HCT of 22, with a repeat HCT of 26. She remained in the hospital
while she was anticoagulated for an INR goal of 2.5-3.5. She was
