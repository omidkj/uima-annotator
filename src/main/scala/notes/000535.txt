History of Present Illness:
70-year-old woman with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
SCT in [**2199**] with complications of chronic GVHD and
nephrotoxicity, ESRD on HD (T/Th/S), who presented with diarrhea
and weakness. She has had URI this past week with a sore throat,
mild cough, malaise associated with worsening pain in her left
eye (has chronic post-herpetic neuralgia which can be worse w/
colds) for which she saw her PCP and was prescribed an eye
ointment. Patient had fever Thursday to 100.4, otherwise
afebrile but having chills.
.
Also had watery, non-bloody diarrhea starting on Wednesday and
continuing through today. Initially improved some, but was worse
again today and after large volume diarrhea she felt weak/faint
and needed support from her husband to walk. She called the
oncology office and was told to come into ED for eval. In
addition, the patient's AV graft could not be accessed yesterday
at HD so she did not have dialysis.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.0 100 107/66 20 98%.  Labs were
remarkable for a K of 5.2.  CXR showed clear lungs, Patient
initially spiked fevers to 100.4. Blood cultures were sent and
patient recived linezolid 600 mg IV x1.  She then spiked a fever
to 102 degrees and developed a new oxygen requirement (89% on
RA, came up to 97% on 4L NC) and became hypotensive (SBPs 70s -
80s).  Given fever, antibiotics were broadened to IV zosyn,
patient received tylenol 1 gram PO x1, 300 cc bolus of NS.  Her
blood pressure remained low - patient received a total of 1.3L
NS, but required levophed gtt at 0.3.  On transfer vitals were
102, 120, 18, 120/57 on 0.3 of  Norepinephrine.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient feels better than she did
earlier today.  She complains of sore throat. No nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, BRBPR, cough, chest pain,
shortness of breath.
.

Past Medical History:
PMH:
- Large Cell Lymphoma: Diagnosed [**2197**], initially received RCHOP

- ESRD: Unclear if secondary to chemo, cyclosporine, or  GVHD.
Had LUE AV fistula placed but has occluded L brachiocephalic
vessel on fistulagram then had graft placed in RUE which
required required angioplasty in [**1-/2205**]
- s/p thyroidectomy for thyroid mass, pathology was benign
- herpes zoster c/b post-herpetic neuralgia s/p nerve block
- hyperlipidemia
- prior moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and nonischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 30-40%). Possible etiologies include focal
myocarditis, coronary artery disease (although coronary disease
on catheterization did not fit a coronary territory),
cardiotoxic chemotherapy
- E Coli bacteremia
- Parainfluenza Type 3 Virus bronchitis [**4-/2204**]

hypertension and emphysema.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.2 BP: 127/40 P: 115 R: 18 18 O2: 100% on 4L NC,
CVP of 4
General: Alert and oriented x3, appears slightly uncomfortable
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, slightly dry mucus membrane, PERRLA,
EOMI, left eyelid droop (documented in prior notes)
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
CV: Tachy, S1, S2, [**1-13**] apical systolic murmur, nonradiating
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema, RUE graft with no thrill
Neuro: CNII-XII grossly intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower
extremities, grossly normal sensation

On discharge patient's tachycardia had resolved.  The thrill had
returned in her fistula.  He overall plume status was euvolvemic
with resolution of lower extremity edema.

Specimen Source: Stool

This test was developed and is performance characteristics
determined by
Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, [**Hospital3 14659**]. This test has
not been
cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Special Information
Specimen received in transport media.

Report Status: Final

Result reported to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**10-17**] am.
 .
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**10-16**]

HISTORY: 71-year-old woman with cough, rule out pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-13**] through
8:

There is still residual consolidation in the left lung, close to
the posterior
heart border and lower lobe, but probably improved since the
yesterday's
examination. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size is normal.
Small left
pleural effusion has increased since [**10-14**]. Heart size is
normal. Right
jugular line ends in the mid SVC. [**Month (only) **] clips denote prior
surgery in the
region of the thyroid.

Final Report
CT TORSO DATED [**2205-10-14**]

INDICATION: A 71-year-old woman with history of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma status
post stem cell transplant, presenting with diarrhea, fevers, and
hypertension.
The patient also with new oxygen requirement. Evaluate for
pneumonia.
Evidence of GI infection. Evaluate for possible GI source of
infection,
colitis or abscess.

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images acquired from the thoracic inlet to
the pubic
symphysis following oral and uneventful IV Optiray
administration. Coronal
and sagittal reformats were obtained.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to multiple previous PET-CTs most
recently
[**2204-12-26**].

FINDINGS: Previous thyroidectomy noted. The previously noted
2-mm right
lower lobe nodule is not identified on the current study. There
is no
pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, hilar or
supraclavicular
adenopathy. There are small bilateral pleural effusions which
are new with
overlying atelectasis. NG tube with tip within the stomach.
Right-sided
internal jugular central venous catheter with tip at the distal
SVC.

There is diffuse ground-glass opacity within both lungs with
interlobular
septal thickening which may be due to pulmonary edema. There is
diffuse
peribronchial wall thickening involving the lower lobe bronchi
bilaterally
which is more marked than previously.

CT ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, and both adrenal glands
