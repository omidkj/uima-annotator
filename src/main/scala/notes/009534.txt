Brief Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the surgery service for evaluation
and treatment of his right upper quadrant pain on [**2144-1-24**]. A
diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made and a percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube placed.

Neuro: The patient received anesthesia with good effect and
later had adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake,
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV:  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.  Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout this hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN:
Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF. The
patient's diet was advanced when appropriate, which was
tolerated well. The patient's intake and output were closely
monitored, and IVF were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's
electrolytes were routinely followed during this
hospitalization, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.

Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
this stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required during this stay.

Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible. Physical therapy was consulted and recommended rehab
which the patient refused. The patient insisted on being
discharged home regardless of activity status.


At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well otherwise,
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating though with assistance, voiding without
assistance, and pain was well controlled.
