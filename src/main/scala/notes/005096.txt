Echo ([**2196-4-29**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated LVEF 70%. Focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The abdominal aorta is
markedly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.

Renal US ([**2196-4-29**]):
No evidence of hydronephrosis

KUB ([**2196-5-3**] & [**2196-5-4**]):
 Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels
likely suggestive of a postoperative ileus; however, obstruction
cannot be
ruled out.

CT abd/pelvis ([**2196-5-6**]):
1. Dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel up to 5 cm with
multiple
air-fluid levels and a gradual transition point in the proximal
ileum but
without any upstream fecalization. This appearance is likely
related to an
underlying ileus with the decompressed distal ileum related to
lack of
contrast progression at the time of exam.
2. Streaky opacities in the right middle lobe with some more
peripheral
centrilobular nodules likely reflect a combination of
atelectasis and mild
infectious bronchiolitis.
3. No findings of abscess within the abdomen or pelvis. Normal
appearance to the loop ileostomy and colocolonic anastomosis
site. Submucosal fatty
deposition within the ascending colon is nonspecific and may
reflect chronic inflammation or secondary to patient body
habitus and steroid use.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52903**] was admitted on [**2196-4-27**] after undergoing sigmoid
colectomy with coloproctostomy and diverting loop ileostomy for
colovesicular fistula and diverticulitis without complications.
Due to the length of her case and low urine output in PACU,
patient was transferred to the ICU extubated for volume
resuscitation and monitoring. Her course is detailed below by
system:

1. Neuro: Patient was neurologically at baseline throughout her
stay.  Her pain was initially controlled with an epidural
catheter which was dced on POD#4. Patient was then transitioned
from IV to po pain meds as she was tolerated po intake.

2. CV: While in ICU, patient was fluid resuscitated for low
urine output, however SBP was normal throughout. Patient
developed an increasing O2 requirement on POD#2 and an echo was
performed to assess for CHF secondary to resuscitation. ECHO
showed a normal EF and no signs of fluid overload. She was
maintained on home medications when taking po.

3. Resp: Patient was extubated in the OR and had increased O2
requirement on POD#2. CXR performed at that time showed mild
atelectasis b/l but no signs of pneumonia. O2 was gradually
weaned and patient's O2 sats were >95% on room air at the time
of discharge. She was given nebulizer treatments for her COPD.

4. GI: Patient's ostomy was pink and protubertant throughout
stay. Her diet was advanced from clears to regular when passing
flatus. However, on POD5, patient had an episode of bilious
emesis. She was made NPO and started on IV fluids. KUB was
performed revealing an ileus. Due to continued nausea, abdominal
distension, and emesis, an NG tube was placed on POD#8 with 900
cc of bilious return. Patient was encourage to ambulate and
minimize narcotics and reglan was started. Due to prolonged NPO
status, a PICC line was placed and TPN started. A CT abdomen was
performed to investigate prolonged ileus and revealed ileus with
no clear SBO or fluid collections. Once distension had resolved,
patient's NGT was clamped for 6 hours with no nausea or
distension. NGT was removed and she was started on clear
liquids. She was advanced to regular diet when ostomy had good
output and gas, which she was tolerating at the time of
discharge.

4. Renal/GU: Patient had low urine output perioperatively and
was fluid resuscitated in ICU. Her Cr peaked at 2 on POD#1 with
FeNa of 1%. Renal US was performed with no evidence of
hydronephrosis. With continued resuscitation, Cr trended
downward. Once transferred to the floor (POD#4), patient was
diuresed with IV lasix back to baseline weight. Cr at discharge
was 0.9

5. Heme/ID: Patient was on heparin SC and venodyne boots for DVT
prophylaxis. She was given 24 hours of periop antibiotics.

6. Endo: Patient was given stress dose steroids perioperatively
and then resumed on home dose when taking po. She was kept on an
insuline sliding scale and her levothyroxine was continued.

Dispo: Patient was evaluated by physical therapy with
recommendations for discharge home. She worked with the
inpatient stoma nurse and received education.
