Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84-year-old with a significant medical
history, which includes multiple ICU admissions for UTIs that
turn to sepsis who presented from his nursing facility today
with altered mental status. According to my interview with the
family, the nursing facility told them that on Monday he was
drifting in and out of conversations and unable to articulate
his needs in the usual fashion. He was also unable to feed
himself because of tremors of his upper extremities. Though he
had some improvement in his symtpoms today, they report that he
was somewhat below his baseline throughout the day today. The
patient denies any pain or complaints on review of systems, but
family reports that he frequently downplays any symptoms. They
report that he has had some cough and running nose, along with
straining and apparent pain upon urination.

The Emergency Department found: Of note, patient found to be
hypernatremic over the last three days as high as 158. No hx per
nursing facility. Exam: Uncooperative with CN examination.
Spontaneously moves all four extremities but not able to follow
commands well. Patient diabetic with altered MS. FS 115 on
[**First Name3 (LF) 11419**]. No neurologic deficit on examination here. Lab
evaluation shows elevated lactate, hemoconcentration. CXR shows
pulm edema but no focal consolidation. VBG shows no CO2
retention. ProBNP better than previous admissions but still
elevated. Urine was gross pus, UA sent which was pos for UTI.
Started on vancomycin and cefepime after blood cultures, chose
the abx based on past urine cultures. ARF: normal 1.5.
Hypernatremia: given LR total 1L gently [**3-11**] hx of CHF and do not
want to rapidly decreased. Free water deficit around 3.5L. CT
scan of head negative for acute intracranial process.

[**2179-11-25**] Chest X-ray
FINDINGS:  The patient's chin obscures visualization of the lung
apices.
Stable linear opacification in the left mid lung likely
represents atelectasis or scarring.  Calcified bilateral pleural
plaques are again seen.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected.
Cardiomegaly persists.  The aorta is tortuous with
calcification.
IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly without radiographic evidence
for acute
change.

[**2179-11-25**] CT head
FINDINGS:  There is no CT evidence for acute intracranial
hemorrhage, large mass, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.
There is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.  The
basal cisterns appear patent.
Prominent ventricles and sulci suggest age-related involutional
changes.
White matter hypodensity is likely secondary to sequela of
chronic small
vessel ischemic disease; bilateral basal ganglia lacunes are
again seen.
Fluid is seen layering in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
Partial
opacification of the right mastoid air cells is again noted.  No
acute bony abnormality is detected.
IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence for acute intracranial process.
Non-specific
fluid layering in the maxillary sinuses.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M with a medical history that includes CAD s/p CABG, prostate
cancer s/p XRT, multiple UTIs, COPD on 2L NC at home, with
pulmonary hypertension and poor systolic function admitted for
altered mental status and was found to be hypernatremic.

Active Issues:

# Altered mental status: This was initially thought to be likely
secondary to urinary tract infection and hypernatremia. CT head
negative for any acute intracranial process. Neurological exam
not suggestive of focal deficit. CXR similarly negative for
acute process. Troponin elevated, but likely secondary to kidney
injury, as Mb within normal limits. Hypernatremia may be
contributing somewhat to confusion. Rest of metabolic work-up
not suggestive of source of altered mental status. Tox screen
held in setting of being in nursing facility. Patient's family
does not report any recent medication changes. Pt has sterile
pyuria on urine microscopy so was initially treated for a
urinary tract infection with cefepime and vancomycin. However,
his UA had large leukocyte but urine cx was negative so ABX were
stopped because of sterile pyuria and lack of fever and elevated
WBC count. Pt's hypernatremia is likely the cause of his altered
mental status and is li
