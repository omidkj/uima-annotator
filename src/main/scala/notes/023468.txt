abdominal pain.  The patient was found to be hypotensive to
82/50 with an INR of 3.5.  The blood pressure initially
improved with fluids in the Emergency Department.  A

baseline.  The patient received high-dose proton pump
inhibitors, two packed red blood cell transfusions, and 4
units of fresh frozen plasma.

The patient then had an endoscopy in the Intensive Care Unit
which showed two esophageal ulcers without active bleeding.
The patient was hemodynamically stable for over 24 hours and
then was transferred to the medical floor for further
observation.  The patient had no further episodes of bleeding
while in the hospital.  The patient was noted to have a
urinary tract infection while in the Intensive Care Unit and

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile, heart rate tachycardiac, blood pressure
hypotensive to 82/50, respiratory rate tachypneic.  The
patient was saturating 90% on several liters of oxygen.
General:  The patient was a pleasant overweight female.  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Her heart rate was tachycardiac with a
prominent A2 from St. Jude's valve.  The patient demonstrated
good air movement in her lungs bilaterally.  There were faint
crackles at the bases bilaterally.  The abdomen was large
with active bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no
palpable masses, no hepatosplenomegaly noted.  Extremities:
Thin.  Her right foot is in a brace.  The patient had a right
leg ulcer on the posterior distal calf proximal to the ankle.
It was open, discharge on dry gauze, somewhat bloody in
appearance.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient's hematocrit was
noted to be 28.1 down from baseline of 32, white blood cell
count 14.3, platelet count 236,000.  INR 3.5 on admission
which quickly reversed to 2.0 with vitamin K.  Sodium 140,
potassium initially noted to be 5.9 which is hemolyzed and
was 4.5 on redraw.  Chloride 107, bicarbonate 23, BUN 103,
creatinine 1.5, blood glucose 212.

Chest x-ray on admission showed heart and mediastinal
contours which were unremarkable.  There was a slight
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There were no
infiltrates and no evidence of congestive heart failure.  The
patient was status post a median sternotomy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED: The
patient underwent an endoscopy in the Intensive Care Unit
setting which documented 2 mm ulcers in the lower one-third
of the esophagus, one with adherent clot.  There was no
evidence of oozing.  There was some evidence of gastritis in
the gastric fundus.  There was a normal duodenum.  The
patient was started on pantoprazole 40 mg IV b.i.d. and was
followed with serial hematocrits for further episodes of
bleeding which were not noted during the hospital course.

The patient received 2 units of blood to increase her
hematocrit back into the mid 30s.  On transfer to the floor,
the hematocrit was stable at 34.3.

2.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  The patient was noted to have a
urinary tract infection in the Intensive Care Unit.  Urine
culture grew out greater than 100,000 Klebsiella which was
sensitive to Levofloxacin.  The patient was started on
Levofloxacin for a five day course.

3.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient has a history of hypertension.
Initially on presentation the patient was found to be
somewhat hypotensive; however, she rapidly responded to fluid
boluses in the Emergency Department. The patient's blood
pressure medications were held until the patient was
transferred to the medical floor on hospital day number
three.  The patient was restarted on Atenolol 50 mg q.d. and
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. with holding parameters for blood
pressure less than 110.  The patient's blood pressure
remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospital
course.

4.  HISTORY OF GALLSTONES:  The patient was continued on her
Ursodiol throughout the hospital stay.

hospital stay, the right foot ulcer had b.i.d. wet-to-dry
sterile dressing changes.  The patient's heel ulcer did
demonstrate minimal discharge onto the gauze dressing.
Podiatry consult was discussed while the patient was an

and could be followed-up at [**Hospital3 **] on
discharge.

2.  Esophageal ulcers.
