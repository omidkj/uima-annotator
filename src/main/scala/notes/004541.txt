Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
shaking her upper extremities.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 86 year-old woman with PMH s/c PVD, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, and remote hx of upper GI bleed who
presents aftre being found by her husband shaking at 6pm. EMS
was
called and the patient was given 5mg of valium en route. When
the
patient arrived she recieved 6mg of ativan before she stopped
shaking. The shaking is characterized as right upper extremity
shaking. The patient is also not responsive though clearly
awake.


Unable to perform NIHSS as the patient is totally unresponsive.



A rapid first assessment revealed a woman with a shaking right
arm and unresponsive to voice. She withdrew all extremities
except for the right upper extremity. As the patient hasn't been
to this hospital since [**2094**] it was uncertain if she had a
history
of stroke or seizure and a code stroke was called. The patient
was intubated and taken to the ct scanner where a Ct/CTA
revealed
no vessle cut off, but large old left MCA strokes.

Physical Exam:
T:97.3 P:80 R:24 BP:200-247/100-118 SaO2:97%.
General: Unresponsive and shaking.

Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, poor peripheral pulses.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.



Neurologic:
-Mental Status: unresponsive to voice, doesn't follow commands.
Withdraws to noxious. Was clearly awake when she arrived.



-Cranial Nerves: pupils initially demonstrating hippus. After
intubation pupils were ERRL - 3->2 bilaterally. Corneals intact.
Gag intact. Right facial droop.



-Motor: Doesn't withdraw the RUE to noxious. Withdraws the other
extremities to noxious.



-Sensory: Able to sense noxious stimuli in all four extremities.
Uses the left upper extremity swat away noxious stimul applied
to
the RUE.

Plantar response was extensor on the left and flexor on the
right.

Pertinent Results:
CTA - head [**2105-1-17**]
IMPRESSION:
Mild narrowing of the distal M1 segment and relative paucity of
left [**Name (NI) **] branches, which may be related to prior ischemia. No
hemodynamically significant stenosis.
Left lung apical airspace disease.

CXR - [**2105-1-19**]
Endotracheal tube remains low with tip terminating about a
centimeter above the carina with the neck in a flexed position.
Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. A very large
hiatal hernia is again demonstrated and appears slightly less
distended than on the recent study. Unchanged opacity in the
left retrocardiac region probably represents a combination of
the large hiatal hernia and adjacent atelectasis but aspiration
or infectious process is difficult to exclude on this single
projection. New patchy and linear opacity at the right base may
be due to either atelectasis or aspiration. Small pleural
effusions are present. No pneumothorax is evident.

Carotid ultrasound [**2105-1-20**]
IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis in both internal carotid
arteries.

ECHO - TEE [**2105-1-20**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of
the basal septum. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild to
moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.1 cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3 mm Hg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is at least moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac source of embolism identified. Mild
to moderate aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation with mild functional mitral stenosis due to mitral
annular calcification. Preserved biventricular systolic
function. Impaired diastolic relaxation. At least moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

EEG - [**2105-1-20**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to diffuse and marked slowing with
an
accentuation anteriorly and the suggestion of blunted sharp and
slow
activity at times in a semi-rhythmic fashion. While the record
overall
would suggest a moderate to moderately severe diffuse
encephalopathy,
the possibility of some element of anteriorly predominant
discharging
cannot be absolutely excluded. Should the patient's condition
change, a
repeat tracing in two to three days might be of clinical
benefit.


Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is an 86 year-old vasculopath with a history of HTN, DM,
hypercholesterolemia, and dementia who presents with focal
seizure in volving the right upper extremity accompanied by an
inability to attend and systolic blood pressure in the mid 200s.
Physical exam reveals right upper extremity pelegia with normal
sensation. CT exam suggestive of remote left hemisphere strokes.


After intubation the patient had no further shaking suggestive
of a seizure.  The patient was taken off of sedation on the
second day of admission, but never arroused sufficiently to
ensure a safe extubation.  The patient was maintained on
dilantin and keppra.  The old strokes seen on the CT scan were
the only clear provcation identified.  There was no metabolic
derrangement and though the patient had a low grade fever and
some suggestion of a pneumonia on chest x-ray a clear infectious
source was never identified.  The patient never produced sputum
and required minimal ventilatory support, pointing to
atelectasis as the cause of the opacities on her CXR. Regading
the patient's old strokes we examined her risk factors.  Her
total cholesterol was 297 and her LDL was 171. We started her on
simvastatin 40.  Her hemoglobin A1C was 7.8.  She was noted not
to be on a lipid lowering [**Doctor Last Name 360**] or an oral hypoglycemic or
insulin on admission. In fact she was only on aricept and paxil.
 She was maintained on an Insulin sliding scale. Routine EEG was
not demonstrative of a seizure

In the end it was hypothesized that the patient's decreased
arousal was related to an underlying dementia and minimal
cortical reserve ill equipped to recover from a 45 minute
seizure. She was made CMO by her family.
