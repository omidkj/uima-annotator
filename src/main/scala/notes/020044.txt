Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and sternal drainage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-7-15**] Sharp debridement of sternal incision/Wound vac placed

[**2129-7-25**] Removal of 7 sternal wires, sternal debridement.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 yo s/p emergent CABGx4 with IABP on [**6-5**] with
post op course complicated by post op CVA with L sided weakness,
post op atrial fibrillation, LV thrombus, DVT, post op
respiratory failure requiring trach and PEG on [**6-17**] who was
discharged to [**Hospital3 7665**] on [**7-5**].  He was progressing well
when he developed fever/chills on [**7-11**] up to 103.9 with WBC up
to 17.  He was transfered to [**Hospital3 **] where he was
hypotensive to the low 80s and 3 of 4 blood and sputum cultures
grew MRSA.  He was started on vancomycin and Fortaz, got a few
doses of steroids for sepsis and stabilized after about 24
hours.  He did not require pressors.  He had rapid atrial
fibrillation and was started on digoxin.  He had an
echocardiogram which showed an EF of [**10-7**]%.  He had been
improving with a decreasing WBC and stabilized hemodynamics when
he developed large amount of purulent drainage from a hole in
his mid sternal incision with air bubbling out.  A CXR did not
show a pneumothorax and he was transfered here for further
evaluation.

[**2129-7-18**] Echocardiogram:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. LV systolic function appears depressed. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 30 cm from the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2129-7-20**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate to severe global hypokinesis
(LVEF = 25-30 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). No left ventricular mass/thrombus is seen, but
cannot be excluded due to suboptimal apical images. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion
without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

Brief Hospital Course:
Readmitted from rehab on [**7-15**] to the CVICU for sternal drainage
and unstable sternum. Blood and sputum with MRSA. Coumadin held
and heparin started for history of LV thrombus and atrial
fibrillation. Wound opened at bedside and VAC placed. Chest CT
showed fluid collection suprasternally with no evidence of
mediastinitis. ID consult done and recommended Vancomycin for a
minimum of [**5-31**] weeks. Serial echocardiograms were done on [**7-18**]
and [**7-20**] found no evidence of endocarditis - see result section
for further details.  Although LV thrombus was not identified on
echo, it could not be ruled out.  Therefore, he continued to be
anticoagulated for previous evidence of LV thrombus.  He was
evaluated by the plastic surgery team.  On [**2129-7-25**] he underwent
sternal debridement, plating and pectoralis flaps with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **].  Overall he tolerated this procedure well and returned
to the telemetry floor post-operatively.  Drains were removed
prior to discharge.  ID continued to follow and recommendations
include the following:
**Per ID recommendations, following completion on Vancomycin,
patient will most likely require chronic suppressive therapy
with Rifampin. While on Vancomycin, patient will require weekly
CBC, BUN/Cr and Vancomycin trough levels with results faxed to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 85650**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].**
