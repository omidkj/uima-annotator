History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 5239**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with h/o DM2, HTN, HL, CKD, CAD,
breast cancer s/p L mastectomy, and rectal cancer s/p
hemicolectomy ~15 years ago, who initially presented to an OSH
after an unwitnessed fall at home was found to have RH SDH. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and initially
admitted to SICU. She complained of headaches but denied any
other symptoms. Repeat CT at [**Hospital1 18**] showed an enlarging SDH. She
was also started on keppra, and a nicardipine gtt. While in the
SICU, she developed hematemisis with clots and a drop in HCT.
She was subsequently transferred to the MICU. Once
hemodynamically stable, with stable HCTs and no melena, she was
transferred to the general medical floor where she made
significant improvement.

REPORTS:

CXR [**2102-12-23**]:
Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip
in the
mid-to-distal superior vena cava. Lung volumes remain low with
small layering bilateral effusions and persistent perihilar
vascular congestion. However, no overt pulmonary edema is
present on the current examination. Overall, cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. There is a calcified
right paratracheal lymph node suggestive of prior granulomatous
infection. Remote fracture of the left humeral head is
incompletely visualized on the current examination. No acute
bony abnormality. No evidence of pneumothorax.

CXR [**2102-12-20**]: 1. Increased congestive heart failure.
Preliminary Report2. New right upper lobe opacity, representing
combined edema and consolidation on CT.

KUB [**2102-12-23**]:
1. No evidence of bowel obstruction or free air. Questionable
right tenth
anterior rib fracture seen on the edge of the supine radiograph.
Correlation with the patient's symptoms is advised. If there is
clinical concern for a fracture, further imaging with a
dedicated rib series would be advised.

CT head [**2102-12-24**]:
No significant interval change in multiple foci of
intraparenchymal, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. No
evidence of new
hemorrhage.

CT head [**2102-12-22**]:
1. Stable right frontal hemorrhagic contusions.
2. Unchanged subarachnoid component of hemorrhage overlying the
left frontal lobe.
3. Bilateral subdural hematomas, more pronounced on the right
and with
moderate mass effect on the adjacent sulci.
4. Stable small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage with
unchanged size and configuration of the ventricular system.
5. No evidence of new mass effect, hemorrhage, or infarct.

CT head [**2102-12-20**]:
1. Increasing right frontal hemorrhagic contusions and subgaleal
hematoma.
2. New right lateral intraventricular hemorrhage.
3. Left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
4. Evolution of acute-on-subacute subdural hematomas, measuring
1.4 cm on the right and 7 mm on the left.
5. Opacification of the right mastoid air cells and right middle
ear-
accurate assessment of the density of the contents is limited
due volume
averaging from adjacent bone; however, not significantly changed
from prior- attention on followup or consider dedicated CT
Temporal bone study.

CT CHEST [**2102-12-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Bilateral dependent consolidation, right greater than left.
This is most suggestive of aspiration, less likely multifocal
pneumonia.
3. Severe atherosclerosis and ascending aortic ectasia.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Bilateral adrenal nodules, statistically adenomas.
6. Abnormal appearance of left kidney. Recommend non-emergent
renal
ultrasound for further characterization
