hypoxia for his ICU transfer

Elective intubation for push enteroscopy
S/p laminectomy x2 and hemilaminectomy x2

TLC placement in RIJ

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 24347**] is a 61 y/o male with prior history of multiple
myeloma s/p chemo and XRT to pelvis, who presented to ED on [**7-4**]
with decreased sensation and weakness in his lower extremities,
stool incontinence, and urinary retention. MRI showed
compressive metastatic lesions at the T3/T5 levels. He underwent
T2/T4 hemilaminectomies and T3/T5 laminectomies on [**7-5**]. His
post-operative course has been complicated by upper extremity
DVT, for which he was started on heparin gtt.  He was also found
to have lung nodules on chest imaging, for which he underwent
CT-guided biopsy on [**7-11**], pathology pending.
.
Today, the patient was initially normoxic on the floor, but had
progressively worsening hypoxia throughout the day. O2 sats were
95% on room air at 0800, and on evening vital sign checks, he
was found to be satting in the 80s on room air. He was initially
placed on high flow nasal cannula without significant response,
and subsequently required 100% non-rebreather mask to maintain
sats in the low 90s. He was written for fluconazole, acyclovir,
SS bactrim, and 40 mg IV lasix. Prior to transfer to the ICU, he
was satting 93% on the NRB.  He reported worsening shortness of
breath, and frustration at the prospect of transfer to the ICU.
He felt that he had not been eating and receiving pain
medications on time, and that is why his oxygen level was low.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he reports stable labored breathing, and
is requesting to remove his non-rebreather mask. He denies chest
pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. He does
state that his abdomen is more distended than usual but he is
not constipated. He has no strength or sensation in his legs,
and cannot move them.
.
Review of systems:  As per HPI. Also endorses chronic back pain
that is at its baseline. Otherwise denies fever, chills, night
sweats, cough, chest pressure, dysuria, urinary frequency or
urgency.
.
Oncologic history (per BMT notes):  Patient reports being
diagnosed with multiple myeloma after he presented to an outside
hospital [**2109-3-11**] with bilateral lower extremity pain,
weakness and fatigue, renal
dysfunction and confusion.  Intial bone marrow biopsy
demonstrated MM with 100% invovlement, and IgA 2,655.  The
patient was started on XRT to bonysites of disease in the pelvis
and chemotherapy(velcade/revlimid/dex per outside notes).  Since
that time patient has tolerated therapy well and reports a
significant improvement in symptoms.  Patient has had a
significant decrease in paraprotein, normalization of plasma
cells in marrow and improvement in disease on imaging. During
this hospitalization, in addition to the above spinal imaging,
he also received a CT of his chest, which revealed multiple
pulmonary nodules, concerning for metastatic disease
