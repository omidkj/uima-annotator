Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 yo male s/p recent right MCA stroke who presents
w/severe hypernatremia and MS changes.

Patient was actively treated for hypernatremia with fluids, UTI
with antibiotics in anticipation of Scope for source of GIB.
However, on day 2 of ICU stay, the following occured:

I was called to bedside at 0000 on [**2183-10-31**] as patient was noted
to be dyspnic with inability to cough up secretions.  Rattling
breath sounds were noted.  RT suctioned oropharynx and noted
large amount of red blood. O2 saturation was good on NC, but BP
dropped to 70's/palp although patient was still interactive.
Continuous oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning revealed
large amounts of blood and it was decided that 1U of FFP and 1U
of PRBC would be transfused.  ENT was called for possible
epistaxis, but seconds later, patient was noted to be apnic,
despite suctioning and repositioning.  Fellow was notified and
DNR/DNI code status was confirmed.  Despite suctioning,
respiratory drive did not return and patient expired at 0105 on
[**2183-10-31**].
