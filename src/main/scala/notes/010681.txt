with a long history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple
complication, status post recent admission in [**2141-9-28**]
for myocardial infarction, as well as an admission on
[**2141-10-29**] for cholelithiasis treated medially.  She was sent
to rehabilitation on a stable regimen of NPH.  Per her
husband, she was doing well since [**Name (NI) 2974**], with a good
appetite without fever or other complaints.  She was eating
and drinking at baseline.  She had a mild cough, which was
nonproductive.  He saw her yesterday and she was very
confused and disoriented.  He questioned the nursing staff
regarding her insulin dosing and she had gotten 32 units of
NPH in the am.  It is unclear what her blood glucose
fingersticks were at that time.  During the evening, she got
8 units of NPH again.  It was unclear what the fingerstick
blood glucose was at that time.  This morning, at 5 am, she
was no arousable.  Fingerstick blood glucose was low per
report, and she was given some p.o. glucose treatment.  She
was not able to tolerated it, so 911 was called.  She was
brought to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital, and she was intubated
for airway protection secondary to poor mental status.
Fingerstick blood sugar, at the time, was 90 with a
bicarbonate normal.  Chest x-ray and head CT were
unremarkable.  The EKG was significant for an old left bundle
branch block.

Transfer was arranged for the patient to the [**Hospital1 346**].  Prior to transfer, a repeat
fingerstick blood sugar was 20, and the patient received one
ampule of D50 with improvement in her mental status.  A D5
drip was begun and Unasyn was given.  Upon arrival to the
[**Hospital1 69**], the patient was in some
discomfort from the intubation tube.  But, she was awake and
oriented followed commands.  The patient denied any other
complaints.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for observation
overnight in the medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 346**].  She continued to do well,
throughout the night, and the following morning, she was
extubated without complications.  She was continued on her
glucose drip and blood glucose was followed closely.
Subsequently, she was transferred to the Medical [**Hospital1 **], where
her IV fluid was discontinued, and the patient was given p.o.
food to eat and drink.  She was restarted on a regimen of NPH
insulin starting at 28 units q.a.m. and 6 units q.p.m.  the
patient is a knowledgeable registered nurse and can aid in
the management of her glycemic control.  Therefore, we
instructed the nursing staff to check with the patient and
allow her to take two units more or less depending upon what
she anticipated eating on that day.  A regular insulin
sliding scale was used to main euglycemia when the NPH was
inadequate.  Four time a day, fingerstick blood glucose was
done to include q.a.c. and q.h.s.

From a renal perspective, the patient has been doing well and
continues her hemodialysis.

On the date of discharge, the patient was hemodialyzed
without problem.
