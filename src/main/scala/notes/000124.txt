Pertinent Imaging:
.
EEG: This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy
states. There are no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform
features
noted.
.
Non-Contrast Head CT:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, hydrocephalus, major or minor vascular
territorial
infarction. The density values of the brain parenchyma are
maintained. The
soft tissues and osseous structures are intact. The visualized
paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR:
Mild increase in interstitial markings at the left base could be
due to
bronchitis. There is no focal area of consolidation. Lungs are
otherwise
clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
normal. There
is no pleural effusion. Mild levoscoliosis is present.


Brief Hospital Course:
33 yo F with PMH reportedly of asthma and anxiety, p/w altered
mental status and hyponatremia of unclear etiology.

# Hyponatremia: The pt presented with acute change in mental
status and was found to be hyponatremic as low as 119 (lab
details above). The patient was initially worked up for acute
change in MS including a negative CT, LP and EEG. The patient
was also given meningeal dosing for Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and
Acyclovir, which were later dc'd. Urine and serum tox were
negtaive. The patient was initially hypotensive upon admission
to the MICU to SBP in the 80s, however it was unclear what the
patients baseline SBP was in addition the patient had been given
empiric dose of ativan.

Per report, patient was undergoing bowel prep with Golytley when
became acute ill and began vomiting. Her hx indicated that she
was drinking increased hypotonic fluids including Gatorade. The
patients urine osms were low at 314, but not maximally dilute,
also with Na > 50, so not retaining maximum Na. Thus the
etiologies include sodium loss due to a recent change to low
salt diet with excessive water replacement while others included
adrenocortical insufficiency (although increased cortisol in
hemolyzed sample) and SIADH.

The patient was initially given hypertonic saline and later
changed to normal saline. The patient was water restricted and
after 24hrs her mental status cleared to baseline, however she
did not recall the prior days events. The patient was discharged
directly from the MICU to home at her baseline mental status,
only complaining of mild symptoms of nausea and headache (?
secondary to an LP) and able to take adquate but decreased POs.
.
# Anemia: The patient was previously being worked-up by GI for
BRBPR. There was no evidence of bleeding during her admission.
The pt's Hct remained stable in the mid 30s.  This should be
followed up as an outpatient. However it should be noted that
the patient appeared to become hyponatremic secondary to her Go
Lytley dosing and thus this should be addressed if the patient
is to undergo further endoscopic evaluations.
