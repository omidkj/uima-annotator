FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-3**], there is no interval
change.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in this patient with an
S-shaped
thoracolumbar scoliosis. There are patchy opacities in the upper

zones bilaterally, most likely reflecting summation shadows
rather than focal regions of pneumonia. Pulmonary vascularity is
within normal limits and there is no evidence of pleural
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No change or evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

Successful exchange of a gastrostomy tube for a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 9835**]
GJ tube with the tip terminating in the proximal jejunum.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
Respiratory Distress / Aspiration PNA:
Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be in extremis with
visible tube feedings in nose and oropharynx. He was febrile,
tachycardic, tachypneic, with leukocytosis and lactate of 5. His
respiratory distress was presumed to be due to aspiration
(chemical pneumonitis v. early aspiration pna) so in the ED he
was given a dose of Vancomycin, Flagyl, Cefepime, and Levaquin.
Pt also had awake nasotracheal intubation in the ED for airway
protection. On arrival to the MICU blood pressure was low
normal, raising concern for developing sepsis. Vancomycin,
Unasyn, & Levaquin were intially continued for MRSA coverage
given long term nursing home residency and dbl coverage for gram
negatives and streptococcus. However after he developed a rash
on [**7-29**], and given the fact that clical presentation and chest
x-ray did not clearly indicate pneumonia, his antibiotics were
changed to Augmentin alone for a 7 day course. On [**7-31**], he was
successfully extubated. However he continued to have labored
breathing due to marked upper airway secretions and insufficient
ability to protect and clear his airway. He received frequent
nebulizer treatments, airway suctioning, and chest PT. On [**8-2**]
it was discovered that his sputum from [**7-28**] grew out pseudomonas
aeruginosa; ceftazidime was started. On [**8-4**] a midline was
placed in his right arm to facilitate completion of the 14 day
course of ceftazidime.
After discussion with the team and the patient's brother, on
[**8-3**] Interventional Radiology converted his PEG tube to a j-tube
in hopes of decreasing long-term risk of aspiration events. His
respiratory status stabilized, with ongoing rhonchi from upper
airway secretions, requiring suctioning every few hours, but no
respiratory distress.
.
Fever:
On the mornings of [**8-18**], and [**7-31**] pt spiked fevers to 101.2,
102, and 100.9. However throughout this period WBC count
declinced, and clinical respiratory status and CXR gradually
improved. He was pan cultured x 2. Labs were drawn to evaluate
for pancreatitis, hepaptis, and cholecystitis, which all came
back normal. He was continued on Augmentin x 6 days then
switched to a 14 day course of ceftazidime (first dose [**2195-8-2**])
after sputum culture showed pseudomonas.
.
UTI:
Pt with history of UTI on prior admission with
MSSA/Enterococcus. Per nursing records, pt with no history of
indwelling foley catheter at NH. Two UAs here showed lg WBCs,
mod leuks, concerning for UTI. Initial antibiotic coverage for
aspiration PNA was appropriate for potential UTI. However urine
cx from [**7-28**] showed no growth and urine culture from [**7-29**] showed
only 10-100,000 yeast/mL.
.
Rash:
On the morning of [**7-29**], new, confluent, erythematous patches were
noted on pt's lower extremities and pelvis to waist, as well as
on his left arm. Rash was thought to represent a drug rash or
environmental allergy. His vancomycin, levaquin, and unasyn were
discontinued, and he was started on Augmentin. He was also
provided Sarna lotion prn for pruritis. By [**7-30**], this rash had
resolved.
.
Seizure Disorder:
Patient is on phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like
activity at NH, prior to episode of
