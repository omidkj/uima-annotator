Chief Complaint:
s/p 30 ft fall

History of Present Illness:
43 yo female who presented after a ? fall/jump from a 3rd story
window during a reported altercation with her son.  She
apparently had GCS 15 at scene and went to [**Hospital1 1474**] where she
had a 2 minute convulsion.  This resolved.  She was intubated.
She was noted to have multiple areas of hypodensity in the right
parietal region on CT as well as an area of encephalomalacia in
the right parietal lobe indicative of remote infarction.  She
has a right temporal
longitudinal fracture.  She was found to have right CSF
otorrhea. She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:

1. Small amount of acute hemorrhage within the interpeduncular
fossa.

2. Ill-defined low-attenuation areas within the right parietal
lobe. A non- emergent MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

3. Area of encephalomalacia within the right parietal lobe,
likely indicative of remote infarction.

4. Hyperdense right intraconal mass with an appearance on CT
most consistent with an hemangioma. However, MRI of the orbits
is recommended on a non- emergent basis to further characterize
this finding.

5. A right temporal longitudinal fracture with associated
opacification of the mastoid air cells consistent with
hemorrhage. No dislocation of the ossicles.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:

1. Non-displaced fractures of the transverse processes of the
C6, C7 and T1 vertebral bodies respectively as described above.
No other acute fractures identified.

2. Mild reversal of the normal cervical lordosis likely
positional or secondary to underlying muscle spasm. Clinical
correlation is recommended. No spondylolisthesis.

3. Partially imaged collapse of the right upper lobe of the
lung.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in left basilar atelectasis,
otherwise no significant change from [**2133-6-25**].

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST
CONCLUSION: At least some of the previously noted areas of
abnormal density on CT could well represent post-traumatic
contusions. More chronic areas of encephalomalacia with
hemorrhagic residua are possible, but obviously it would be
helpful to know if there was any preceding neurologic episode
that would correlate with such findings.

NOTE: The right-sided intraconal mass lesion seen on CT scan is
re- demonstrated. While the present images are not optimized for
orbital detail, the location of the lesion seems most consistent
with the original diagnosis of a hemangioma.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Her brief hospital
course by systems are as follows:

Neurologic - Neurology was consulted for her seizures and felt
that they were likely as a result of the trauma and recommended
Dilantin and MRI of the brain which was done (see Pertinent
results). Neurosurgery was also consulted for the temporal bone
fracture and CSF leak; there was no operative intervention. The
CSF leak did eventually resolve. She remained sedated in the ICU
for nearly 2 weeks; these were eventually weaned off and she is
currently alert and oriented x3; appropriate and cooperative
with her care. Her Dilantin was discontinued after 10 days and
she has been without any reported or observed seizure activity.

Respiratory - She arrived intubated to the ED and remained
intubated in the ICU. There were several attempts to wean and
extubate; she was even taken to the operating room by Anesthesia
for extubation because of pharyngeal edema; all efforts failed.
ENT was consulted because of the pharyngeal edema and a
questionable sinusitis given fevers; there was no operative or
other non-invasive recommendations.  Infectious Disease had been
consulted by this time and recommended Linezolid and Bactrim for
coverage for staph coag + in her sputum. It was felt that over
time the edema would eventually resolve. A percutaneous
tracheostomy was performed on [**6-18**] after these attempts were
unsuccessful. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and
transferred to the floor. On [**6-28**] she had a respiratory event on
the floor where she became hypoxic; she underwent upper
extremity ultrasound which revealed thrombus within the mid to
distal left subclavian vein. Speech language pathology was
consulted for Passy-Muir valve; these attempts were unsuccessful
as well as patient demonstrated increase in pressure and
excessive coughing. Her tracheostomy was therefore downsized to
a #6 Fr fenestrated non-cuffed to provide her with the ability
to speak.

Cardiac - There were no acute cardiac events. She had an ECHO
which revealed EF >75%; no aortic regurgitation or mitral
regurgitation was  seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. She was placed on a beta blocker from
time of admission to the ICU for tachycardia and has remained on
Lopressor 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. It is reasonable for this to be
discontinued once at rehab if her HR remains stable.

Gastrointestinal - Early during her ICU stay a Dobbhoff was
placed for feedings; she did manage to self discontinue the tube
on several occasions; discussions took place with her once more
awake regarding a g-tube she refused multiple times. A swallow
evaluation was done at bedside, which she did pass. She is
currently tolerating a regular diet. She was started om low dose
Remeron and Marinol to stimulate her appetite.

Genitourinary - There are no acute issues; she has maintained
more than adequate urine output throughout her stay.

Musculoskeletal - Her spine fractures were nonoperative.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted early on.

Hematology - Heme was consulted following the pulmonary embolus
and felt the likely etiology of her thrombosis may have been
attributed to vascular damage due to trauma
as well as an indwelling, left subclavian venous line. And that
further investigation of possible causes of thrombotic events
was not necessary. It was recommended that anticoagulation
therapy with heparin or LMWH for at least five days and
subsequent bridging to Coumadin for a 3 to 6 months course be
initiated. Her most recent INR was 2.1 on [**7-2**] on 10mg dose of
Coumadin. In terms of anemia, no clear etiology. No apparent
sour
