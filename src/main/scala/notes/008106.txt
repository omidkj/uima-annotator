Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
82 yo M with dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 60%, severe TR, HTN,
h/o VF, DM2, PAF, h/o PE and UGIB who presents with respiratory
distress from rehab. He was supposed to be discharged from rehab
today, but had this complication. His HCT was reportedly slow
trending down, so he was given 1 unit of PRBC yesterday for HCT
27.9, and today developed respiratory distress. (Of note, HCT at
nursing home increased to 31.9 this morning after transfusion.)
Per nursing home notes, he desat to 88% with exertion and was
given lasix 40mg x1 and then 80mg IV x1. An ABG was done and he
was 7.46/54/78 on 50% ventimask. His vitals signs there were T
98, BP 106/66, HR 85, RR 20 and no recorded oxygen sat at that
time. He was brought to the ED.
.
In the ED, his vitals were T98.2, BP 88/54, HR 50, RR 20, O2sat
99% 6L NC. Per ED notes, he was 88-96 on RA then placed on 3L NC
with sats in the mid to upper 90's. He had an EKG and a CXR
which showed fluid overload. His blood pressures were staying in
the 90-100 range systolic and no diuretics were given for
concern over hypotension. He was admitted to the MICU for
further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo M with dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 55%, severe TR, HTN,
h/o VF, DM2, PAF, h/o PE and UGIB who presents with respiratory
distress from rehab.
.
# Respiratory failure: Likely from fluid overload after
transfusion. He also has significant pleural effusions
bilaterally which are chronic. Currently stable on 3L NC. Seems
to have responded to furosemide at rehab fairly well. BNP is at
baseline value. Of note, his Ddimer is elevated, but he has h/o
of PE and currently unclear what etiology.  Patient responded
well to lasix and breathing was back to baseline at discharge.
He had a therapeutic/diagnostic thoracentesis on 10.20 which
removed 1200cc of exudative fluid.  Patient was to be discharged
on home oxygen as per orders from rehab for [**Company 33467**] - 2L at rest
and 4L with exertion.
.
# Recurrent pleural effusion: Unclear etiology but pt has
asbestosis exposure concerning for malignancy. Previous cytology
have been negative however was transudative in the past. Has
been getting tapped in the past. Offered VATS in the past, but
pt and family declined and wanted pursue repeat thoracenteses
based on symptoms. Currently effusions look similar to prior
CXR.  Patient at home oxygen level on 2-3L, which is his
baseline.  Received thoracentesis on 10.20 which removed 1200cc
of exudative effusion.  Pt will f/u on cytology drawn during
thoracentesis with his PCP.
.
# Hypotension: Resolved, currently normotensive with volume
repletion following diuresis.  Patinet's anti-hypertensives held
while in house and restarted on day of discharge - tolerated
well.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 1.5 from baseline
1.1.-1.2. Curently at 1.4 with volume repletion.  Likely due to
volume depletion following diuresis.  Will have follow up labs
as outpatient when discharged.
.
# HTN: Initially held BP meds; restarted and tolerated well on
day of discharge.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diet controlled
.
# Cardiomyopathy: significant dilated cardiomyopathy and
valvular disease. Currently no surgical intervention planned.
Has pacemaker but defibrillator turned off per old notes in OMR.
Discharged back on home dose of ASA, BBlocker, Bumex at
discharge.
.
# Paroxysmal AFib: currently rate controlled in the 70s.  Rate
control with metoprolol was continued.  Not on anticoagulation
more than ASA given history of severe GI bleeding
.
# Psychiatric: Continued Seroquel 25 mg QHS
.
# demenita: continued donepezil
.
.
After discussion with the patient, patient's family, and medical
staff, all were in agreement that the patient was a suitable
candidate for discharge.  Please follow up on your pleural
effusion cytology with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
