Admission Date:  [**2133-7-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-7-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2060-11-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 15676**] is a
76-year-old Russian female who presented in 11/00 with
congestive heart failure manifested by DOE and lower
extremity edema.  Transthoracic echocardiograms in 11/00 and
[**1-15**] both revealed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15677**] ASD.  Cardiac catheterization in
[**2133-4-17**] revealed normal coronary arteries with a QP to QS
of 3:1.  She was admitted to cardiothoracic surgery for
repair of her ASD.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, CVA with left hand and
face numbness, GERD, PAF, ASD, pulmonary hypertension, sleep
apnea.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  TAH/BSO.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Verapamil 180 mg po q d,
Amiodarone 200 mg po q d, Norvasc 5 mg po q d, Paxil 10 mg po
q d, Coumadin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Non smoker, non drinking, Russian speaking,
lives with her daughter [**Name (NI) 4248**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with a heart rate of
60, pressure 147/76 and a weight of 82 kg.  NAD, healthy
appearing overweight woman.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light with extraocular movements intact; mucus
membranes moist, no erythema or exudates; and icteric.  Neck
supple without lymphadenopathy, no bruits.  CTAB.  Regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, grade 3/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the base.  Soft, nontender, non distended,
well healed midline scar.  1+ bilateral lower extremity edema
and varicosities.  Neurologically intact.

EKG, sinus rhythm at 61, .16/.12/.48.  Chest x-ray, findings
consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.  Scattered
linear opacities in the lung bases, likely due to
subsegmental atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and underwent
repair of her secundum ASD on [**2133-7-7**].  Her postoperative
course was complicated by sinus arrest with a narrow complex
junctional escape rhythm requiring AV pacing.  She had an
uneventful recovery in the ICU awaiting permanent pacemaker
placement planned for postoperative day #6.  Unfortunately
she was febrile on the day of the proposed procedure,
necessitating its cancellation.  Urinalysis was suspicious
for a urinary tract infection, and she was started on empiric
IV Levofloxacin; urine culture subsequently grew out
Enterobacter species.  She was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #8, afebrile and AV paced.  On
postoperative day #10 she underwent an uncomplicated
placement of a Medtronics pacemaker in her left pectoralis
muscle set to DDD mode.  The pacemaker was interrogated on
postoperative day #11 and verified sequential AV pacing.  Her
lung exam at that time was concerning for developing
cardiopulmonary process, and chest x-ray was obtained which
demonstrated right lower lobe consolidation. She was started
on a 5 day course of IV Cefazolin and by postoperative day
#13 her exam was improved and so was the follow-up chest
x-ray.

The remainder of her course has been uneventful.
Unfortunately her PT level has remained at a 3, so she is
being discharged to a rehab facility on [**2133-7-21**].

Discharge examination, afebrile, heart rate 68, pressure
108/57, weight 85.1 kg.  NAD, healthy appearing overweight
woman.  PERRL with EOMI; mucus membranes moist, no erythema
or exudates; anicteric.  Neck supple without LAD; no bruits.
Decreased breath sounds/mild end inspiratory crackles at the
right base; incision clean, dry and intact.  Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the
base.  Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended, well healed
midline scar.  1+ bilateral lower extremity edema and
varicosities.  Neurologically intact, grossly.

Discharge laboratories, WBC 8.5, hematocrit 30.8, potassium
5.1, magnesium 2.2, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg one po q d, KCL 20 mEq po
q d, Percocet [**11-18**] po q 3-4 hours prn, Colace 100 mg po bid,
Micronase powder to perineum [**Hospital1 **], Tylenol 650 mg po q 6 hours
prn, Levofloxacin 250 mg po q d times two days, Paxil 10 mg
po q d.

COMPLICATIONS:  Sinus arrest requiring permanent pacemaker
placement.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good and in stable condition to rehab.

FOLLOW-UP:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**11-18**] weeks, and primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-18**] weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Secundum ASD status post repair.
2.  Sinus arrest, status post permanent pacemaker placement.
