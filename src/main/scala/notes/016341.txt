History of Present Illness:
This 72M pediatrician was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma 4 weeks

ago and is followed up by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] at [**Hospital3 328**]. He
subsequently developed fever and petechial rash prior to
receiving his chemotherapy without infectious cause identified.
He was given (19 days ago) CHOP and reportedly did well with
this. He recieved G-CSF on day 2 of CHOP.  He subsequently did
well in the intervening weeks after chemotherapy and went
through neutropenic phase without complication. His WBC
subsequently recovered to 3.5K as of last week.
.
He states that he has had a subacute shortness of breath on
exertion and a dry non-productive cough since approximately 2
weeks ago.
However on friday [**10-1**] pt developed a fever to 101.6 along with
maculopapular rash over his trunk and legs as well as a mild
cough. He was given levofloxacin empirically for possible
pneumonia and his fever came down on [**10-2**]. He subsequently
developed nausea and mucositis associated with chemo and was
treated with zantac. Sunday [**10-3**], pt developed progressive
malaise and fatigue and was seen at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for temp
of 100.8. Initial labs notable for leukocytosis of 22K with left
shift, query G-CSF effect vs infection; acute renal failure with
creatinine at 2.2 (baseline 1.1); and abnormal LFT's: SGOT 94,
SGPT 201, alk phos 329, TB 1.6, direct bili 1.0, lipase 13. LDH
476. RUQ U/S demonstrated thickened, edematous gallbladder wall
but no peri-cholecystic fluid (could be due to contracted
state), but nl pancreas, liver and cbd. There was medium amount
of ascites and small pleural effusions. CXR revealed atelectasis
of RLL with interval improvement, and small bilateral effusions.
He was therefore given a dose of ertapenem in the ER for
potential biliary infection. He received 1mg of PO vitamin K. He
was transferred for further care.
.
On arrival to BMT floor pt complained of feeling fatigued, has
dry mouth and feeling short of breath which is affecting his
ability to speak. On arrival to the BMT unit he was feeling
progressivly short of breath and requiring supplimental O2
(O2sat 94% on 4L).  His vital signs on arrival T [**Age over 90 **]F  HR 132 RR
26  BP 94/70.  He was given 500cc bolus of NS and transferred to
the ICU. He also received a dose of acetaminophen.

CHEST CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, evaluation
is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast
administration. The heart and great vessels are grossly
unremarkable. Note is made of striking axillary lymphadenopathy,
left greater than right. The largest lymph node located in the
superior aspect of the left axilla measures 4.1 x 2.4 cm (2:15).
A right hilar lymph node is pathologically enlarged and measures
1.9 x 1.1 cm (2:31). There are several prevascular and
mediastinal/precarinal lymph nodes, none of which meet dcriteria
for pathology by CT. Lung windows demonstrate a possible,
ill-defined opacity in the anterior aspect of the left upper
lobe (2:19). There is bilateral basilar bronchovascular
thickening. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
compressive atelectasis are also present. No pulmonary nodules
are identified.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note,
lack of intravenous contrast administration limits detailed
evaluation of the intra- abdominal organs. The liver is grossly
unremarkable. Once again, the gallbladder wall is noted to be
markedly thickened measuring 1.6 cm in maximal dimension (2:72).
Note is made of periportal pathologic lymphadenopathy with lymph
nodes measuring 1.6 cm, and 1.5 cm in short-axis dimensions
respectively (2:66, 2:70). The pancreas, adrenal glands, and
kidneys appear grossly unremarkable. A small amount of
perinephric fluid is noted bilaterally. The spleen is prominent
measuring 14 cm in coronal dimension. There are multiple,
non-pathologic retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. A
small amount of fluid is noted tracking in the paracolic gutters
bilaterally. There is no free air within the abdomen. The
abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear grossly
unremarkable.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, lack
of intravenous contrast administration limits detailed
evaluation of the pelvic organs. A moderate amount of fluid is
noted to track along the paracolic gutters entering within the
pelvis. Note is made of a few sigmoid diverticula. There is no
evidence of diverticulitis. The prostate is mildly enlarged
measuring 5.2 x 4.8 cm (5.2 cm, transverse dimension). The
bladder and intrapelvic loops of small bowel are grossly
unremarkable. There is prominent pathologic inguinal
lymphadenopathy with the largest lymph node located in the right
groin measuring 2.6 x 2.0 cm (2:126).

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: A few curvilinear/scalloped deformities of
the endplates of S1, L5, and L3 are noted with associated
sclerosis. These are slightly atypical in appearance but most
likely represent Schmorl's nodes. No suspicious lytic or blastic
lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive axillary, hilar, mediastinal, portal, and inguinal
lymphadenopathy likely consistent with patient's underlying
history of T-cell lymphoma. No previous examinations are
available at this time for comparison.

2. Please note, detailed evaluation of the intrathoracic,
abdominal, and pelvic organs is limited secondary to lack of
intravenous contrast administration. Thickening of the basilar
bronchovascular walls could indicate an infectious or
inflammatory process. Small bilateral pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis, a focal opacity in the right lower lobe
and another focus in the left upper lobe could represent focal
atelectasis/inflammation versus infection/aspiration,
particularly at the bases. Clinical correlation is recommended.

3. Highly irregular, thickened gallbladder wall without
distension is better evaluated on concurrent ultrasound
examination from the same date. No additional findings on this
limited non-contrast CT evaluation.

4. Mild-to-moderate
