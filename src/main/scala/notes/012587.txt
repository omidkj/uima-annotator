Codeine / Percodan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 yo female with HIV on HAART (last CD4 1359 on
[**9-25**]) and asthma p/w 1 day of dyspnea and non-productive cough
with rhinorrhea. Denied fevers at home, did have sick contact
yesterday. [**Name2 (NI) **] po intake today [**1-8**] feeling unwell and cough.
Tried home flovent and albuterol without benefit.
.
Of note, pt was seen by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2132-11-20**] with increased blood
sugars due to changes in her med regimen, muscle aches, and
increase in her asthma sxs and increased use of inhalers. Before
that, she was seen in the ED on [**2132-9-20**] for a flu-like illness,
treated with oseltamivir, although flu swab came back negative.
.
En route to the ED, EMS gave 2 combivent nebs. In the ED,
initial VS were: 99.8 130 158/100 22 100%. Exam with wheezes and
rhonchi, 3rd combivent neb given, also 125mg IV
methylprednisolone and magnesium. Decompensated with hypoxia
requiring NRB, agitation and altered mental status. Given
midazolam, etomidate, succinylcholine and was intubated but
remained with sats in high 80s to low 90s on FiO2 1.0, so
increased PEEP to 12. CXR initially with diffuse opacity,
possible multifocal PNA. Given TMP-SMX and levofloxacin. Second
CXR with ?florid heart failure. Started on NTG drip. CTA chest
being done. Bedside U/S with hypodynamic LV. Access is 3 18g
PIVs. On propofol. Current VS: 130s 170s/90s 94-95% on 430x16,
12, 100%.
.
On the floor, patient is intubated and sedated, so further
history is not possible.

III. Imaging
.
A. CXR ([**2132-11-22**])
IMPRESSION:ETT and NGT positioned appropriately. Diffuse
pulmonary ground
glass opacities, more confluent at the bases, may represent
atypical infection
such as PCP versus pulmonary edema. Please refer to subsequent
CTA chest for
further details.
.
B. CTA Chest ([**2132-11-22**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy ground-glass opacities distributed across the lung
parenchyma, with associated septal thickening, most compatible
with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
2. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Bibasilar consolidations, concerning for pneumonia.
Aspiration is also on the differential given the rapid onset of
symptoms.
4. No pulmonary embolism detected to the subsegmental levels.
5. No dissection.
.
IV. Cardiology
A. EKG
Probable sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2132-4-14**] the ventricular rate
is faster. ST-T wave changes are new.
.

.
B. ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 25%). Systolic function of apical segments is relatively
preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion primarily around the right atrium.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc. -
cannot fully exclude multivessel CAD). Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2126-6-28**], the findings are new.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2128**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
