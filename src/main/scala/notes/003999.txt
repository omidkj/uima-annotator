Admission Date:  [**2114-4-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-5-10**]

Service:  ICU

ADDENDUM TO THE HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Respiratory failure:  The patient has been continued on
treatment for her Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia and has been increasingly weaned from the
ventilator.  She has in general been kept on a pressure
support ventilation with pressure supports of [**11-27**] and a
PEEP of 5 with an FIO2 of 35%.  However, she has tolerated
several trials of transition to a trachea mask.  She has gone
several hours at a time with a trachea mask after which she
has maintained adequate oxygenation and ventilation, though,
started to feel tired after several hours and has been
returned to the ventilator.  Her goal remains diuresis at 500
cc to 1 L negative per day.  The patient has been maintained
on trachea care, as well as nebulizers prn and aggressive
suctioning though her level of secretions has not increased.

2.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient as mentioned above
has continued to be diuresed 500 cc to 1 L per day.  She was
started on diamox 250 b.i.d.  Has also been diuresed with
intravenous Lasix of 20 intravenous b.i.d. as tolerated and
has had Captopril started with a dose that has been titrated
up to 25 mg t.i.d.

3.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection:
The patient has been maintained on vancomycin.  Due to
supratherapeutic levels, her vancomycin has been held and on
the morning of the 25th, her vancomycin level was still 20.
She will be given vancomycin for trough levels less than 15.
She will be requiring vancomycin through the [**7-14**],
which will be one month after her last positive Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus blood culture.  The patient
has for the most part remained afebrile, though, did have a
temperature of 102 briefly the morning of the 25th after
which point she defervesced spontaneously.

4.  Acute renal failure:  The patient's creatinine remained
slightly above her baseline and on the morning of the 25th,
her creatinine was 1.5.  It is felt that the creatinine
elevation from her baseline may be secondary to prerenal
physiology as the patient has been diuresed with Lasix, and
overall remains total body water overloaded.

5.  Hypotension:  The patient's pressures have been stable in
the 120-150 systolic range.  Her hydrocortisone dosing is now
being tapered and on the 25th she has been weaned to a dose
of 25 mg b.i.d. of hydrocortisone.  It is felt that she will
likely require at least 30 mg a day replacement for her
adrenal insufficiency for some time and so following
discharge her hydrocortisone should be weaned down to 20 mg
in the morning and 10 mg at night.

6.  Anemia:  The patient is a Johovas Witness as mentioned
before and does not allow blood transfusions, therefore, she
has been maintained on 20,000 units twice a week of Procrit,
as well as iron replacement, and her hematocrit has remained
stable.

7.  Breast cancer:  The patient's chemotherapy has continued
to be held and her oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **]
regarding plans for possible re-initiation of treatment.  The
oncologist noted that the patient should not be restarted on
any treatment for her breast cancer at present and should
follow-up with her in clinic to discuss the possibility of
re-initiation of therapy.

condition.
