History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with recent admission for PNA s/p 7 days vanco/cefepime,
azithromycin who presented from nursing home with worsening SOB
and confusion.  He underwent HD prior to admission, and was
noted to be hypoxic and confused.  At that time 02 sats 80s on
room air.  In the ED, VS significant for 02 84%RA, which
progressively worsened to being on BiPAP.  ABG 7.52/38/71.  He
was given vanco/zosyn for asp PNA as well as ASA, and admitted
to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, he was broadened to vanco/ceftaz, cipro, flagyl.
He received HD.  He was noted to have confusion [**1-10**] requiring
seroquel, pulling off his 02, then haldol.  EKG unchanged.  He
was weaned off BiPAP and transitioned to 02
.
Currently history is provided by his son.  [**Name (NI) **] seems more awake
but still slightly agitated.

CXR [**1-9**]:
FINDINGS: An upright AP radiograph of the chest shows low lung
volumes
bilaterally with dense bibasilar consolidations. That at the
left base
appears progressed from most recent comparison and that at the
right base is
new. There are bilateral pleural effusions. A poorly marginated
right upper
lobe consolidation is also demonstrated. Superimposed upon these
findings is
increased interstitial markings, suggesting pulmonary vascular
congestion.
Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
redemonstration of
atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.

IMPRESSION: Multifocal consolidations, progressed from the
previous study,
concerning for multifocal pneumonia with possible superimposed
cardiac
congestion.
.
CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
enlarged,
consistent with parenchymal volume loss. Periventricular white
matter
hyperdensities bilateral, reflecting the consequence of chronic
microvascular
infarction. Punctate calcified foci bilaterally are unchanged.
There is no
fracture. The right mastoid air cells are clear and there is
opacification of
the left mastoid air cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Opacification of the left mastoid air cells, new

[**1-11**] speech and swallow
IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thins. Single episode of penetration
of nectar
residue.

[**2104-1-12**] CT chest

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy.
Moderate amount of pericardial effusion is noted. The lungs show
diffuse
ground-glass opacities and septal thickening with a number of
linear
atelectases in the right upper lobe. Further noted is bilateral
high-density
material in the distal bronchi in the right lower lobe and left
lower lobe
accompanied by consolidations with air bronchogram. Findings are
suitable for
bilateral aspirations (including apparent prior barium
aspiration). Also seen
bilateral pleural effusions of moderate size. There is a small
loculated
pleural effusion at the right upper chest. All findings are new
as compared
to the previous CT scan from [**2102**].

Two hypodense lesions are seen in the lateral limb of the left
adrenal, one
measuring 1.6 cm and an additional one measuring 1.9 cm. Both
are of low
attenuation. Findings are consistent with adenomas.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
2. Bilateral ground-glass opacities and septal thickening,
findings which may
be consistent with pulmonary congestion.
3. Bilateral right lower lobe and left lower lobe aspirations
with
consolidations with previously ingested barium.
4. Two small adenomas in the left adrenal.

[**2104-1-17**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG, apparently in wakefulness and
drowsiness, due
to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of
generalized
slowing. These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy
affecting
both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic

disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There
were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies
may
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features,
including
at the times of leg movements.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yoM with Alzheimer's dementia, ESRD on HD, HTN and recent dx
of multi-focal PNA treated with one week of vanco/cefepime and
azithro, readmitted with confusion, SOB and hypoxia, admitted to
MICU on BiPAP and quickly weaned, called out to floor where he
was seen to have very waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status/delirium
on top of dementia.

1. Mental status: Pt with known Alzheimer's dementia and poor
short term memory who was seen to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
delirium. At first thought to be due to a couple doses of Haldol
and Zyprexa, but as time passed continued to have episodes of
extreme somnolence in which he would minimally respond to
sternal rub, lay in bed and moan responses to questions, and
have myclonic jerks in his bilateral upper extremities. He would
then spontaneously wake up the next day and be very alert and
interactive, not oriented at all, but conversational, pleasant
and as normal as his baseline was. He was never in
cardiopulmonary distress during any of these episodes and vitals
were completely stable through entire admission including oxygen
saturation.

Workup for this mental status included normal WBC's through
admission, no fevers at all, BCx's negative x2, no UCx b/c pt is
anuric HD dependent, negative DFA for influenza, normal BUN's
and chemistries through admission, normal blood sugars, all
normal LFT's and no h/o liver disease, negative lipase, negative
