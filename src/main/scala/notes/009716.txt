Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1620**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a PMH of CVA, MI, L Breast CA, PUD,
CHF, Parkinson's with dementia, who presents from [**Hospital1 62825**] after an episode of respiratory distress. The pt was found
by EMS to be satting 68%RA->87-93% on 100%NRB.
.
In the ED, the pt was thought to be in CHF with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 62826**] and
was in afib with RVR (rate 110s-160s). Her HR ranged from
112-162 with RR 19-32. The pt was placed on BIPAP with
ABG-->7.35/63/225 on 100% FiO2. She was given Lasix 40 mg IVx1,
Ativan, Lopressor 5 mg IVx1. The pt developed a temp of 104.8
and her BP dropped from 113/58 to 90/63 and then 80/palp. Code
sepsis was called and pt received 3L IVF with R subclavian line
placement. Pt was given Levoflox 500 mg IV x1. Lactate was 2.3,
down to 1.3 after fluids. Pts UA was suggestive of a source of
the fever with 21-50 WBC and mod bacteria. CXR revealed ?LLL PNA
vs atelectasis.

TTE [**2121-1-22**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular  systolic function appears grossly preserved but
views are technically suboptimal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
CHEST, ONE VIEW: There are no comparisons. The evaluation is
markedly
limited due to patient positioning. There is thoracic scoliosis.
There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung is
clear. There may be a left lower lobe infiltrate as well as a
small pleural effusion.
.
EKG: afib with RVR at rate of 75-150, nl axis, poor R wave
progression with ?reverse Q waves in anterior leads (?prior
posterior MI)


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a PMH of CVA, MI, L Breast CA, PUD, CHF,
Parkinson's with dementia, who presented with respiratory
distress, fever, and hypotension.
.
1. Septic shock/hypotension:
Pt had temp of 104.8 with SBP down to the 70s in the ED,
unresponsive to fluids.  Only revealing source was dirty UA (so
possible urosepsis) as well as ? L sided PNA.  Lactate down to
1.1 after fluids (was 2.3 on admission). Pt was covered broadly
initially with vancomycin and ceftazidime both UA and
pseudomonal/MRSA coverage given pt lives in an [**Hospital1 599**]. She was
given multiple NS boluses. She was able to come off pressors on
HD#2. However, the bp remained low normal and did drop again
into the low 80's. Over the next several days, the pt did
periodically require that phenylephrine be added back on for bp
support. However an accurate bp [**Location (un) 1131**] was difficult to obtain.
There was no arterial line and the pt had poor upper extremitity
pulses. The bp measurements were obtained by noninvasive cuff on
the lower extremity. It was ultimately determined to tolerate bp
in the 80's without the addition of pressors and assess
perfusion using other surrogates such as urine output and warmth
of extremities. By these measures, there was good perfusion and
no need to continue pressors. The culture data remained negative
and the pt was treated for a presumed PNA given the infiltrates
on chest imaging.
.
2. Respiratory Distress:
   The pt's initial presentation was for respiratory distress,
which required NRB to maintain oxygenation at Rehab. She
required BiPAP in the ED. This was assessed to be
multifactorial. Pulmonary edema was considered to be a major
contributor initially given infiltrates on CXR and a BNP of
27,000 as well as the rapid afib in the ED. The pt was diuresed
and put on BiPAP and did show some improvement although the BP
dropped. However the pt was febrile to 104.8 and found to have a
lactate of 2.3 and there was a suspicion for PNA as well as a
source of the respiratory distress. Ceftaz and vanc were
initiated. She was given nebulizer treatments.
   Over the course of the hospital stay, the respiratory status
failed to i
