Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21073**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
EGD
Blood transfusion

History of Present Illness:
86F with stage IV ovarian cancer, prior malignant effusions,
asthma, GERD off prilosec for past few days presenting with
epigastric/mid chest pain, constant since last night, no
radiation. She has not had much to eat over the past few weeks
but had a hot dog on Friday night. Says she has chronic
shortness of breath which has not changed recently. She recently
switched back to carboplatin therapy (1st recent dose [**2139-3-23**])
after going through one cycle of gemcitabine therapy. While she
was on gemcitabine, she experienced significant fatigue,
decreased appetite, early satiety, and weight loss, as well as
increased dyspnea that required a therapeutic thoracentesis on
[**2139-3-17**]. No cough, fevers.
.
In the ED, her heart rate was reported to be in the 90s,
although it apparently increased to the 130s. There was some
dullness to percussion at the right lung base. EKG was sinus
with no ischemic changes. LFTs and lipase were wnl. CXR showed
stable pleural effusion. Patient was given protonix/gi cocktail
with some improvement of symptoms but still had some chest
discomfort. Given h/o malignancy, a CTA was done which was
negative for PE, stable adenopathy/dilated esophagus with
esophageal wall thickening/air fluid levels/distal air and
?obstruction. Patient was transferred to the MICU for EGD and
concern for possible inability to protect her airway after
sedation.
.
While being prepped for the EGD, after having benzocaine spray
administered to her oropharynx, she suddenly became hypoxic to
the 80s and was noted to have rhonchi throughout all lung
fields. Anesthesia was called to intubate in order to perform
the EGD. The patient and family agreed to intubation for
purposes of the procedure. Prior to intubation she was satting
97-100% on a NRB.
.
In the ICU, the patient underwent EGD which showed partially
digested food boluses in the distal esophagus with esophagitis.
Some was retrieved and the rest was pushed forward into the
stomach. She was extubated and transferred to the floor. On
presentation, she feels well and denies abdominal pain, SOB, or
other pain. Denies h/o dysphagia or odynophagia. No diarrhea or
constipation or dysuria. Uses cane to ambulate long distances
but otherwise no limitations.

Past Medical History:
Stage IV ovarian cancer, diagnosed ~4 years ago, failing
treatment but "not hospice yet" (per call-in sheet)
asthma
hypertension

The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 686**], although she has three
daughters who live nearby.

.
[**2139-4-9**] CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY:
      FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
.
[**2139-4-5**] CT Chest: Markedly thickened distal esophageal wall with
proximal dilatation. There is distal air suggesting some amount
of patency. There is no evidence of tracheal compression.
.
[**2139-4-5**] CXR: Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.
Pulmonary vascularity remains within normal limits. Again seen
are linear opacities at the right base possibly representing
atelectasis versus scar. Persistent small-to-moderate
right-sided pleural effusion is seen, little changed from prior.
Left-sided granuloma again noted.  Impression: Little change
from prior study with persistent small-to-moderate right pleural
effusion.
.
[**2139-4-6**] CXR: Persistent bibasilar infiltrates and right pleural
effusion. Subtle evidence for development of mild pulmonary
vascular congestion.
.
[**2139-4-5**] EGD: Findings -
Esophagus:
  1) Lumen: There appeared to be a small Schatzki's ring at the
gastroesophageal junction, but this will need to be reassessed
once the small pieces of food have passed.
  2) Contents: Undigested food including unchewed pieces of
hotdog were found in the entire esophagus.
  3) Mucosa: Esophagitis with erythema, mucosal edema, and
congestion was seen in the distal esophagus that was most likely
due to the food impaction.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Not examined.
IMPRESSION:
1) Food in the whole Esophagus
2) Esophagitis
3) Schatzki's ring
4) Otherwise normal EGD to stomach antrum

Brief Hospital Course:
86F w/ stage IV ovarian Ca, asthma, HTN, GERD p/w epigastric
pain.
.
## Foreign body esophagitis: Likely from difficult passage of
incompletely chewed food boluses. Schatzki's ring at discovered
GE junction may have contributed (a biopsy was taken of the
GEJ). Patient admitted to MICU for observation and endoscopy.
She was given local anesthtic for endoscopy and became acutely
hypoxic requiring intubation for procedure (?aspiration).
Endoscopy showed food stuck in the distal esophagus which was
removed. Her pain resolved s/p EGD and she was extuabated the
following morning. S&S eval negative for aspiration. Tolerated
full liquid diet. She was started on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] and will followup
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from GI for a repeat endoscopy in 2 weeks once
inflammation improves.
.
## Sinus tachycardia, hypertension: Thought possibly related to
pain and anxiety, and was minimal response to IVFs. In addition,
pneumonitis may have contributed. Notably, per OMR notes, HR
frequently in 120's at clinic. She was started on a metoprolol
with good control of HR and BP.
.
## Hypoxia: Transient hypoxia peri-EGD likely due to aspiration
pneumonitis/PNA and treated with 7 day course levofloxacin and
flagyl. Also with elevated BNP and some evidence of fluid
overload and was given lasix with good effect. The patient was
weaned off supplemental O2 and ambulated with stable SaO2.
.
## Ovarian CA: Stage IV with h/o prior malignant effusions. s/p
first cycle of gemcitabine on [**2139-2-23**] complicated by fatigue,
anorexia, dyspnea (required therapeutic thoracentesis by IR on
[**2139-3-17**]). Given side effects, she has been transitioned to
carboplatin and received her first dose on [**2139-3-23**]. Pancytopenic
from carboplatin therapy but not currently neutropenic, however
could potentially be functionally so. Followed by Heme/Onc
during stay. Transfused 1 unit pRBC as anemia due to
underproduction from chemotherapy. Plan to c
