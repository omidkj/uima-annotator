Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Central venous line placement
Open reduction of ankle dislocation
Placement of multiplane external fixation system
Closed reduction fibular fracture.

History of Present Illness:
67F who was transferred from OSH with open right ankle fracture
sustained at the OSH.  She had been admitted after feeling short
of breath just prior to a scheduled EGD.  Blood glucose was
found to be 34 after having been NPO for the procedure and she
was admitted for workup during which PE was
ruled out.  Overnight she fell in the bathroom (at the OHS) and
sustained an open ankle fracture.

At time of admission she had a significant increase in oxygen
requirement and blood glucose was noted to be high.  The
medicine service was consulted and she was taken emergently to
the OR for washout of the open ankle fracture and placement of
external fixator.

.
IMAGING:
[**2107-5-6**] Right Ankle Fluro: Multiple fluoroscopic images of the
right foot and ankle from the operating room demonstrates
interval placement of external fixation pins within the
tibia and calcaneus. Please refer to the operative note for
additional details. The total intraservice fluoroscopic time was
8.5 seconds.
.
[**2107-5-6**] CXR: No previous images. The low lung volumes may
account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of
the heart. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could also
relate to low lung volumes, though some overhydration cannot be
excluded.
.
[**2107-5-7**] Echo: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function.
Thickened aortic valve leaflets, likely without severe stenosis.
Very technically-limited study.
.
[**2107-5-7**] CXR: Frontal view of the chest is compared to prior
study of the day before. Mild cardiomegaly, vascular congestion,
low lung volumes, relatively unchanged from prior study.
.
[**2107-5-8**] KUB: Two views of the abdomen, limited in technique
although best possible film given the patient did not cooperate
with the examination. There continues to be markedly distended
small bowel loops with some air in the colon. Could represent
ileus or developing obstruction. CT may be helpful for further
evaluation.
.
[**2107-5-8**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Cirrhotic liver and moderate amount of ascites.
2. No evidence of intestinal obstruction.
3. Bilateral pulmonary consolidation at the bases.
4. Mild gallbladder distension - if concern for cholecystitis,
suggest ultrasound to further assess.

[**2107-5-11**] KUB: Multiple dilated loops of bowel compatible with
ileus or early bowel
obstruction.

[**2107-5-11**] CT ABDOMEN:
1. No bowel obstruction. Mildly distended loops of large and
small bowel is likely due to ileus.
2. Nodular liver contour in keeping with cirrhosis. Moderate
amount of ascites. Splenomegaly. Anasarca.
3. Bibasilar opacities at the lung bases improved compared to
prior, likely atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion.

[**2107-5-11**] ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
Greatly limited study. Ascites in all four quadrants but
predominantly within the left upper and left lower quadrants.
Gallbladder is distended.
.
R ankle X-ray [**2107-5-17**]:
RIGHT ANKLE, THREE VIEWS.
External fixation hardware is in place. There is an oblique
fracture of the distal fibular metadiaphysis extending into the
mortise joint. Due to
limitations of positioning, the views are atypical. However, the
mortise
joint appears congruent with the joint space preserved. No talar
dome OCD.  No medial malleolar fracture is detected. There is
surrounding soft tissue swelling.

IMPRESSION:
Nondisplaced distal fibular fracture. Mortise and tibiofibular
joint remain congruent.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
67 yo F with a past history of DM, Asthma, CHF, CAD, and
cirrhosis, transferred from an OSH for repair of an ankle
fracture, now s/p washout and external fixator placement, who
was subsequently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory
failure after her sugery. In the MICU, she spiked fevers, and
paracentesis was done which was negative for SBP, with SAAG 2
suggestive of portal HTN. Pt continued to spike, and UCx, BCx
sent, and pt briefly hypoten
