Chief Complaint:
lethargy, hypercapnic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**2128-11-21**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82F with PMH asthma, T2DM, HTN, OSA, dementia
who presents with four days of increasing lethargy and not
acting like herself. Daughters have noticed she's been
increasingly somnolent during the day and agitated at night.
Patient has had multiple nonspecific complaints over the past
several days: headache, weakness, heavy arms, stomach ache.
Daughters noted she's had a runny nose, no sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **]
fevers, chills, cough, changes in bowel movements, nausea or
vomitting. Upon leaving church this morning her legs gave out
from under her and she was lowered to the ground by her family.
Patient did not fall or strike her head. No LOC but confused,
intermittently responsive to family and repeating  "I'm on the
ground" over and over again. Family gave her food incase pt was
hypoglycemic. No report of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
headache, or dysuria. She lives with her daughters. She was
hypoxia to 70s in the field. She has been intubated once
previously in [**12/2127**] for a similar presentation. Of note, she
appears to carry a diagnosis of adult onset asthma for which she
uses albuterol and advair only with respiratory illnesses. Has
not needed these medications recently. Nonsmoker. She has been
prescribed BIPAP for many years, but has not used it in the past
several months. Per recent PCP note in [**9-/2128**], she has had poor
tolerance to BiPAP. Patient with baseline dementia confused,
cannot remember daughters' names occasionally, but conversant,
and not incontinent of urine and stool.
.
In the ED inital vitals were 97.6 74 145/63 24 100% 15L
Non-Rebreather. Exam was notable for no wheezes, poor air
exchange. With the exception of a bicarb of 43, BMP and CBC was
reassuring. BNP 218 and troponin neg x1. Lactate was 1.0, UA was
unremarkable, and cultures were sent. Patient had a bicarb of 43
and ABG showed 7.19/127/49/51 just prior to initiating BIPAP.
Patient was intubated for apnea without complications. EKG
showed SR 71, unchanged from prior. CXR showed mild pulmonary
edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions. She was given
Methylprednisolone 125mg and Levofloxacin 750mg for COPD
exacerbation, though diagnosis of COPD is unclear. She improved
with nebs in the ED. Per report, there was concern for previous
aspiration given some food particles seen with intubation.
She has remained afebrile and HD stable.
.
Recent ABG on settings of CMV, FiO2 50%, Peep 5, TV 400, RR 22
is pH 7.52 pCO2 50 pO2 182 HCO3 42.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is intubated, sedated, not
opening her eyes or responding to commands.

IMAGING:
.
-[**2128-11-22**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
systolic function. No significant valvular disease.
.
-[**2128-11-22**] LENI Left leg:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
.
-[**2128-11-23**] CXR
IMPRESSION: An AP chest performed with the patient rotated
severely to the
right, excludes lateral right lower chest. It shows moderate
left pleural
effusion stable
