Admission Date:  [**2107-1-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-1-18**]


Service:  MICU

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Urosepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
20%, coronary artery disease with two vessel disease,
diabetes type 2, hypertension, who was last discharged from
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**2106-11-17**] for
congestive heart failure exacerbation, urinary tract
infection, who presented back on [**2107-1-8**], to the
[**Last Name (un) 14843**] Medicine team with intermittent chest pain,
left-sided, with radiation to her neck and diaphoretic with
dysuria and mental status changes and was found to have a
urinary tract infection.  Secondary to crackles on
examination patient was treated with Lasix and was given
levofloxacin for a UTI.  The patient's Lasix dose was
increased from 80 p.o. b.i.d. to 80 IV b.i.d. and patient
then on [**2107-1-9**], was found to be hypotensive,
60/palp, with increasing mental status changes.  The patient
was given one liter of normal saline, was started on Levophed
and dopamine with appropriate response of increasing blood
pressures and she was transferred to the MICU and her
levofloxacin and dopamine were markedly weaned off.  The
patient was then switched to intravenous antibiotics and
transferred to the MICU.  Patient on admission to the MICU
denied any chest pain or shortness of breath and presently
patient's mental status was back to baseline.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Patient's temperature was
95.9, heart rate 98, blood pressure 100/73, respiratory rate
26, 92% on 100% face mask.  General:  Lying in bed in no
apparent distress - speaking normally.  Was awake and alert
and oriented times three.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate,
positive systolic ejection murmur.  HEENT:  No jugular venous
distention.  Chest with minimal bibasilar rales.  Abdomen:
Soft and non-tender, non-distended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm bilaterally, pink in color, no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema were present.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  To the MICU, UA was positive for
many bacteria, no yeast.  WBCs greater than 50.  Her urine
cultures grew Gram negative rods greater than 100,000 at the
time.  Her CBC was 9.8, 9.9, 30.8, 194.  Chem-10 was
remarkable for anion gap of 16.  CKs and troponins were
negative times three at that time.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed left axis deviation, left bundle
branch block, otherwise normal sinus rhythm and no ST/T wave
changes.  Good R-wave progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Sepsis.  Patient's sepsis was secondary to urosepsis  in
which her urine culture eventually grew E. coli which was pan
sensitive.  Patient initially was started on levofloxacin on
the floor and was continued in the MICU.  Patient, however,
was then started on ceftazidine for double Pseudomonas
coverage in the MICU.  The patient once in the MICU again
dropped her systolic blood pressures to the 60's to 70's
range with maps consistently below 65.  Patient was then
quickly started on the sepsis protocol and _________ was also
initiated at that time.  The patient was also started on
Levophed and dobutamine per the sepsis protocol.  When seen
in the MICU patient was initially with good systolic blood
pressure off all pressors, however, when being admitted she
started breathing in a labored pattern again and was
tachypneic and coolness on the skin and was hypertensive with
decreased mental status.  The patient at that time had
already been given five liters of normal saline and was
started on Levophed with little effect on blood pressure.
The patient's heart rate decreased to the 60's at which time
patient was given one amp of atropine with no changes in
heart rate.  The patient was also started on dopamine and
intubated secondary to mental status changes.  The patient
was started on ceftazidime in addition to her levofloxacin.
Per the sepsis protocol patient was also placed on _________
on hospital day two in the MICU-B, patient's hematocrit
dropped from 32 to 22 and patient's coags including INR and
PTT had doubled in value.  For this reason patient's
____________ was stopped.  DIC labs were checked and patient
was not in DIC.  The patient was continued on the sepsis
protocol with good hemodynamic response and was completely
weaned off all of her pressors by day two in MICU-B.  The
patient remained afebrile on levofloxacin and vancomycin,
however, due to no organisms supporting use of vancomycin
which were grown on cultures, vancomycin was stopped.  The
patient remained on a course of levofloxacin for nine days in
the Intensive Care Unit and will be continued for one more
day on the floor.  The patient remained afebrile on the
levofloxacin and had no blood pressure or heart rate changes
once off all pressors.

2.  Pulmonary:  Patient was intubated on [**1-9**]
secondary to mental status changes.  The patient remained
intubated while on the sepsis protocol, however, when
attempting to extubate on [**1-11**] it was noted that
patient was not able to pull in good tidal volumes.  At that
time patient's airway resistance was calculated to be in the
20's which was much higher than normal being 5 for her and
her compliance was normal.  Unsure of why her airway
resistance was high a bronchoscopy was done in which no mucus
plugs and no airway collapse was found.  However, patient
continued to have a left lower lobe collapse on her chest
x-ray.  The patient remained intubated and was started on IV
Solu-Medrol secondary to her increased airway resistance.
However, after three to four days of being on intravenous
Solu-Medrol patient's airway resistance did not change going
from 22 to 21.  Her compliance remained the same.  The
patient was also started on increasing frequency of
nebulizers at that time.  After further discussion with the
family it was decided that the patient, if extubated, code
status was changed to "Do Not Re-intubate."  Therefore,
patient was tried on inhaler therapy and maximal diuresis
with Lasix responding to 40 IV b.i.d. and was then extubated
on [**2107-1-15**].  The patient did well post extubation
with no problems and no changes in her respiratory rate.
However, the etiology of her increased airway resistance was
still unclear.  The patient remained on pulmonary toilet
including chest PT, was started on scheduled and p.r.n.
nebulizers and was changed back to her home dose of Lasix 80
p.o. b.i.d. on transfer to the floor.  Patient again remains
a "Do Not Re-intubate."  The patient may need outpatient
thyroid function tests as her reason for increased airway
resistance was unclear with a negative bronchoscopy.

3.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20%.
Patient was effectively diuresed in the MICU with Lasix 40 IV
p.r.n.  Patient's I's and O's goals were met and on leaving
the ICU patient's total length of stay net as positive 819
cc.  The patient never had any congestive heart failure
exacerbation while in the unit.  On day of transfer to the
general [**Hospital1 **], the patient was restarted on a low dose of
captopril and changed from intravenous Lasix to p.o. Lasix 80
b.i.d.

4.  Hematology:  Patient's hematocrit dropped while being on
the _________ overnight.  However, with three units of packed
red blood cells the patient had an appropriate response with
hematocrits remaining in the high 30's to 40's throughout the
rest of her hospitalization.  The patient had no other
hematologic complications during her hospitalization in the
MICU.

5.  Renal:  Patient's creatinine was 1.9 on admission,
however, with adequate fluid resuscitation and removal of all
nephrotoxic drugs, the p
