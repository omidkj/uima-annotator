PLAN:

RESPIRATORY:  The patient should complete a 10-day course of
Levofloxacin and Clindaycin for an aspiration pneumonia.  The
oxygenation is improving at the time of discharge to the
point where she is no longer requiring oxygen.  She will
complete a 10-day course of Levofloxacin and Clindamycin on
[**12-11**].

The patient did received a course of Solu-Medrol given her
history of asthma, but this was discontinued prior to her
being discharged from the ICU.  She should continue on an
Albuterol inhaler as needed.

NEUROLOGICAL:  Given the patient's history of seizure
disorder she was loaded on Dilantin.  She had no seizures
while in the hospital.  She should continue on Dilantin at
100 mg three times a day.  She should have the Dilantin level
checked later this week.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was found to be hepatitis C,
antibody positive.  Therapy was deferred, given her current
alcohol use.  The ALT was also higher than the AST, which was
interesting given the history of alcohol abuse. She should
have the LFTs rechecked as an outpatient.  She should
continue on Protonix for peptic ulcer disease.  She should
continue on her psychiatric medications, as outlined in the
discharge medications.  She will be discharged to a
psychiatric facility to further address her depression.

ENDOCRINE:  In terms of her thyroid function tests, the TSH was
depressed as the free T3 and T4.  This was thought to be
secondary to euthyroid sick syndrome and the TSH and T3 and T4
should be repeated as an outpatient.
