Chief Complaint:
fever and chills with headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple
myeloma nonsecretory type with free light chain disease, kappa
predominating, who came to ED because of fever, chills.
He is now s/p a matched cord blood nonmyeloablative
transplant(about 50 days ago) with conditioning regimen of ATG,
Fludarabine, Melphalan, and methylprednisolone.
.
When he was hospitalized for allogeneic transplant in this [**Month (only) 116**],
his hospital course was complicated by fever, with positive
blood cultures with Staph, coag(-)from his hickman. He was
initially treated with Vancomycin, Cefepime and Flagyl and was
discharged home on Vancomycin which completed on [**2137-5-22**]. He
also had diarrhea in the hospital, which was C diff negative.
This resolved when his counts recovered and he has had no signs
of GVHD. His immune suppression is FK-506 and CellCept. He
recently has been noted for a positive EBV viral load and BK
virus in the urine.
He has been having intermittent fever, chills over several weeks
and has been followed by oncology as outpatient for those
problem. [**Name (NI) **] recently has been noted for a positive EBV viral
load and BK virus in the urine. Given his increased EBV viral
load, he was started on Valcyte 50 mg twice per day.
Last night, he developed fever up to 101.6F. He came to ED.
.
In ED,VS T 100.6, BP 145/88, HR 135, RR 20, O2 sat 100% on RA.
ED staff decided to admit him to BMT service for possible line
infection. He received IV vanc and IV cipro in ED.
.
On the floor, he stated feeling okay. reported frequency for few
weeks, denied HA, cough, sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC TREATMENT HISTORY:
1. Diagnosed in [**10/2129**] with non-secretory multiple myeloma with
vertebral collapse and rod placement. Surgery complicated by
DVT, treated with Coumadin for 18 months. Bone marrow biopsy
showed ~ 40% plasma cells and the presence of a
hypogammaglobulinemia. He was also found to be mildly anemic
with hematocrit of between 35 and 40. His beta-2 microglobulin
was 2.3. He was initially treated with melphalan and prednisone
8 cycles, dexamethasone and thalidomide.
2. Received intermittent doses of Cytoxan followed by high-dose
Cytoxan on [**2131-7-4**] with stem cell mobilization and collection
and status post high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell
transplant in 10/[**2130**].
3. Noted for disease progression on BM bx in [**2133**] and was
treated on the multiple myeloma/dendritic cell vaccine trial in
[**7-/2134**] and taken off study due to progression of disease.
4. Increasing back pain during this time but noted for new
herniated disc and underwent surgery in 09/[**2133**].
5. Begin Revlimid with dexamethasone but developed a rash at
higher doses of 25 mg daily, then restarted a three-week cycle
with increasing doses as of [**2135-9-8**]. His usual dose has been
15 mg daily for 21 days with dexamethasone on six days of the
cycle. He is status post 13 cycles with his last cycle completed
on [**2136-9-14**].
6. Noted for disease progression/persistence with bone marrow
aspirate and biopsy revealing approximately 80% plasma cells.
7. Status post one cycle of Cytoxan, Velcade and Decadron
initiated on [**2136-10-16**]. Second Cycle on [**2136-11-9**], Day 11
Velcade held due to low counts. Third cycle on [**2136-12-4**] with
Day 11 Velcade held due to low counts.
8. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy from [**2136-12-24**]: Normocellular
erythroid dominant marrow with persistent involvement by
patient's known plasma cell myeloma. The plasma cells comprise
7% of aspirate differential and 10-15% of the bone marrow core
biopsy by CD138 immunohistochemical staining and are kappa
restricted.
9. Completed Decadron 20 mg daily for two days in [**2-/2137**],
repeated weekly x 2 in order to temporize his disease prior to
his transplant.
10. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy from [**2137-3-18**] shows a
normocellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with trilineage
ematopoiesis with persistent involvement by known plasma cell
myeloma. Plasma cell distribution is variable on the aspirate
smear ranging from 10% to focally as high as 30%), with
cytologically typical forms. By immunohistochemistry, CD138
positive plasma cells ccount for 20-30% of marrow cellularity,
and are kappa restricted by kappa and lambda light chain
staining.
11. this [**Month (only) **] : matched cord blood nonmyeloablative transplant
with conditioning regimen of ATG, Fludarabine, elphalan, and
methylprednisolone.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Multiple myeloma as outlined above
2. History of Rosacea
3. Question seizure history dating back to [**2126**] with 2 syncopal
episodes. However most consistent with vaso vagal reaction. The
patient insisted on continuing the neurontin as a "security". He
was
initially started on Dilantin but this was tapered and
discontinued in [**2130**] and he was put on Neurontin. He was
thoroughly evaluated and there was no evidence for seizures on
EEG. His Neurontin was tapered to 100 mg three times per day
with no evidence for any seizure activity. This was discontinued
at the beginning of this year.
4. Spinal surgery with rod placement in [**2128**] at time of
diagnosis. Recent surgery for herniated disc in 9/[**2133**].
5. H/O DVT in the setting of initial spinal surgery.
6. Hypogammaglobulinemia, treated with IVIG.
7. Left inguinal hernia repair.

Pertinent Results:
[**2137-6-7**] SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Involvement by lambda-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia, [**Last Name (un) **]
immunoreactive, worrisome for post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disorder (Note:  Immunohistochemical stains
show increased CD138-immunoreactive plasma cells, singly and in
small clusters, occupying 10-15% of marrow cellularity. By
immunoglobulin light chain staining these are lambda restricted.
 Of note, the patient's prior marrows showed kappa restricted
plasma cells.  The differential diagnosis includes
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder versus recurrence
of his myeloma with the phenomenon of isotype switch.Given the
increased numbers of [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Virus encoded RNA ([**Last Name (un) **])
positive cells in this patients marrow, the former is favored.
Additionally, scattered histiocytes with ingeste
