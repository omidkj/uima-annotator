History of Present Illness:
67 year old woman with end-stage non-ischaemic dilated CMP, s/p

bioprosthetic MVR and ASD repair in [**2188**], s/p biventricular ICD,

chronic a fib, HTN, HL, DM2 admitted to hospital in [**State 45679**] with CHF (NYHA Class IV). Well-known to us here.
She was transferred to CCU for milrinone and insertion of PICC
line for home milrinone therapy.
.
At baseline, she is able to ambulate between her living room and
kitchen with some difficulty and sob, although she has been
chronically fatigued.
.
She recently had a prolonged admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ago for CHF
which improved drastically on milrinone drip (CO 2.0 increased
to 4.0) and was discharged. Approximately three weeks ago, she
became short of breath while at rest and sleeping, and required
home Oxygen (2L) at night (and occasionally during the day),
with good response. Approximately two weeks ago, she had an
episode of hyperkalemia, and subsequently discontinued her
spironolactone and digoxin with good effect. Over the last two
weeks, her healthcare provider in [**State 32926**]
discontinued her diovan, and lopressor,due to concerns about low
BP (systolics in the 80-90 range). She has subsequently
developed symptoms of CHF with LE edema, five pound weight, DOE,
orthopnea, PND. She therefore presented to OSH [**6-26**] where she was
found to be in CHF and started on a lasix drip (no record of net
diuresis). There her dyspnea and her energy improved, although
she did have an episode of N/V after morphine.
.
She denied any loss of consiousness, blurry vision, fever, chest
pain, productive coughs, or hemoptysis / hematemesis
/hematochezia.
.
Her cardiac risk factors include: history of HTN, type II
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, age greater than 65, and heredity.

etoh, denies illicit drugs. Originally from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].

Family History:
There is no known family history of premature coronary artery
disease or sudden death. Sister had uterine cancer. Mother with
DM died of "[**Last Name **] problem." Her son has a similar cardiomyopathy
and may be a candidate for a heart transplant.

.
Gen: 67 year-old woman in NAD, on O2 resting comfortably in bed,
Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate. Pleasant.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were

S2. No murmurs appreciated

were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. Mild bilateral crackles
at the bases. No wheezing or rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM appreciated. Bowel sounds heard in four
quadrants.
Ext: trace pedal edema. Diabetic foot exam was not significant
for ulcers.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; 1+ DP/PT
[**Name (NI) 2325**]: Carotid 2+ without bruit; 1+ DP/PT
Neurologic exam: no focal deficits on examination.


Pertinent Results:
EKG on admission demonstrated: with no significant change
compared with prior dated [**2193-4-23**] which demonstrated (Atrial
fibrillation with ventricular paced rhythm).
.
[**2193-7-3**] Echocardiogram:
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= <20 %). The right
ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve
prosthesis is present. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2193-4-19**] demonstrated:
(TEE)
Severe nearly static spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage and there is probable thyombus formation.
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (Left Ventricle -
Ejection Fraction: <= 10%). There right ventricular free wall is
hypokinetic. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
mitral leaflets appear normal. The motion of the mitral valve
prosthetic leaflets appears normal. The transmitral gradient is
normal for this prosthesis (although gradient difficult to judge
in setting of low output state). Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**1-26**] demonstrated:
[**1-26**] c cath
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed no significant CAD.
2. Resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated right and left
ventricular filling pressures and mildly elevated pulmonary
artery pressures. The cardiac index was slightly depressed at
2.2.
There was a step-up of oxygen saturation at the mid right atrial

level, suggesting a left-to-right shunt. The PQ/PS ratio was 2.

3. Right atriography showed no evidence of a shunt.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: 67 yo woman with end stage Class IV heart
failure with EF <10%, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p
biventricular pacemaker admitted with worsening heart faillure
and volume overload, now s/p RBB ablation and diuresis.
1. Cardiac:
a. Pump:  Class IV heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
with [**Hospital1 **]-V pacemaker/defibrillator admitted with worsening heart
failure and volume overload likely [**12-28**] to medication
discontinuation.  Initially started on milrinone gtt however she
did not tolerate this [**12-28**] to hypotension with SBP's <70.
Diuresed on IV lasix and metolazone with good effect.  She had
RBB ablation resulting in complete heart block for rate control
as she had Afib with rapid conduction down native pathway likely
contributing to hypotension.  Immediately following ablation she
had significant increase in blood pressure resulting in
increased afterload and flash pulmonary edema requiring
intubation for short period of time.  Post ablation she was
started on dobutamine gtt and diuresis was continued with good
effect.  Aggressive diuresis was discontinued once she developed
contraction alkalosis and a bump in creatinine.  She had
complete resolution of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema on
chest xray prior to discharge.
She was discharged on dobutamine 10mcg/kg/min gtt and digoxin
-tolerate SBP's in the 70's
- lasix 20 mg qday on discharge
-coumadin was restarted prior to discharge given increased risk
of embolic complications in setting of advanced heart failure
-continue spironolactone 25mg daily
-all other prior cardiac medications were discontinued
.
b. Ischaemia: no signs of coronary artery disease on recent cath

continue aspirin
-simvastatin was discontinued as no sign of atheros
