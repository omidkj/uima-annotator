Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: Left and right ventricular function is preserved.
The aorta is intact. The remainder of the examination is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2-23**] to the CVICU for pre-op
workup and Plavix washout. Sheaths were removed uneventfully and
she was transferred to the floor prior to surgery. She remained
pain free.

Thoracic surgical consultation was obtained due to some pleural
calcification and CXR abnormality.  There was not felt to be
anything done for these after a CT scan was performed to
demonstrate some bronchiectasis. A repeat CT scan in a month was
recommended.

On [**2-27**] she underwent CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. See operative note
for details. Of note the patient developed maculopapular rash w/
mild hives after rec'ing Vanco just after induction. vancomycin
was stopped - pt was given benadryl, hydrocort, and pepcid.
Subsequently cefazolin was given peri-op. The case began as on
off pump operation, however, bypass was necessary to repair an
RV tear. She transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
phenylephrine and propofol drips.

She was weaned from pressors easily, extubated on POD #1 and
transferred to the floor on POD #2 to begin increasing her
activity level. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per
protocol. She is known to have a slight facial droop but was
thought to be slightly increased briefly after surgery but
returned to baseline. A new dime sized stage II developed on her
coccyx-Allevyn was placed.

Diuresis towards her preoperative weight was begun, as were beta
blockers.  Physical therapy worked with the patient for strength
and mobility as well.  She progressed slowly, and a
rehabilitation evaluation was obtained for further recovery
prior to her eventual discharge to home.
