Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-4-25**] - Mitral valve replacement with a 25-mm Mosaic tissue
valve.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 951**] is an 81 year old woman with a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation s/p atrialventricular nodal ablation and
permanent pacemaker
placement in [**2131-10-16**], hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
She has recently been complaining of increasing shortness of
breath and therefore was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on heparin for a
cardiac catheterization which was negative and a fat pad biopsy
to rule out amyloid secondary to a speckled appearance of the
myocardium on echo.  She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1535**] for surgical evaluation of her
mitral regurgitation.


Past Medical History:
PAF on anticoagulation s/p AV modal ablation and permanent
pacemaker placement in [**10-20**], hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation,
former smoking smoking, s/p cerebellar ischemia versus
vestibulopathy.


Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 951**] is retired.  She lives alone.  She quit smoking 6
years ago, but smoked [**12-17**] a pack of cigarrettes for more 20
years.  She rarely drinks alcohol.

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-4-22**] Carotid Duplex Ultraound
Impression: Right ICA with no stenosis. Left ICA with no
stenosis

[**2135-4-25**] - ECHO
PRE CPB The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium and left atrial appendage. No definite
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler, though the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation prevents complete exclusion.. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Trhe
right ventricle displays normal free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POSTBYPASS:

Patient is on phenylephrine infusion. The LV cavity is
underfilled. LV EF is hyperdynamic, approximately 75%. A well
seated, well functioning tissue valve is seen in the mitral
position. A prostetic mitral valve strut is seen in the LVOT,
with no evidence of LVOT obstruction. MV area by pressure
half-time is 3.9 cm2 with a peak gradient of 14 mmHg and a mean
gradient of 5 mmHg. A small perivalvular leak is noted before
protamine but not seen after protamine administration. No AI is
seen. The aortic contour is smooth after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 951**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-4-22**] via transfer from
[**Hospital6 1109**] for mitral valve surgery. Heparin was
started for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation in
preparation for surgery. She was worked-up by the cardiac
surgical service in the usual preoperative manner including a
carotid duplex ultrasound which did not show any significant
carotid artery disease. A dental consult was obtained and after
a panorex film was done, she was cleared for surgery from an
oral standpoint. On [**2135-4-25**], Ms. [**Known lastname 951**] was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve replacement
using a tissue prosthesis. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively she was transferred to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated.  She was weaned from
her pressors and transferred to the surgical step-down floor.
On the following day her permanent pacemaker was interrogated by
the electrophysiology service and her epicardial wires were
removed.  Her narcotics were discontinued secondary to lethargy.
 She was placed on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.  Her beta
blockade was increased as tolerated and she was aggressively
diuresed.  By post operative day 6 she was ready for discharge
to rehab.
