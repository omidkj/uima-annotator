Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
n/a


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/PMHx of suspected bronchoalveolar carcinoma, CKD [**2-16**], CHF,
Afib, DM2 on insulin, renal artery stenosis, brought in by EMS
from nursing home due to respiratory distress. The patient was
noted to have progressive respiratory distress with a sat of 88%
on nasal cannula, as well as a fingerstick blood sugar in the
500s this morning with poor response to 10 units of insulin.
Notably, patient was admitted at [**Hospital 3278**] medical center [**Date range (1) 61239**]
for dyspnea, a-fib with RVR, COPD exacerbation, CHF exacerbation

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.8 77 145/57 26 99% 15L.  Patient
was found to be hypoxic with poor response to full face mask. He
also spiked to [**Age over 90 **]F, given tylenol with good response.  He was
tachypneic, with increased work of breathing and started
empirically on vanc/zosyn for HAP.  PE could not be ruled out
with a CT chest as patient had elevated Cr (1.9) so he was
started on a heparin drip.  He was given 10 units of insulin at
rehab, and 10 more units in the ED with subsequent fingersticks
in the 200s.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was on BIPAP, saturating 98% on
minimal settings.

Imaging:
Chest XRay ([**2206-7-27**]): "Left basilar opacification likely
reflects a combination of a small pleural effusion and adjacent
atelectasis.  Infection, however, is not excluded. Hazy
opacification within the mid lung fields bilaterally is
nonspecific, and could reflect an infectious or inflammatory
process.  Mild pulmonary edema is considered less likely."

[**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2206-7-28**]): "The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion."

Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound ([**2206-7-28**]): "No evidence of
deep vein thrombosis in either right or left lower extremity."

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of diastolic heart failure,
atrial fib/flutter, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
who was admitted with dyspnea likely secondary to an
exacerbation of his heart failure in the setting of atrial
flutter with rapid ventricular response.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient
presented in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, for which he
initially required supplemental oxygen with 15L nasal cannula
and was later transitioned to BiPAP, for which he was admitted
to the MICU. Possible etiologies for his respiratory failure
were thought to include CHF exacerbation, pneumonia, PE, COPD
exacerbation, or progression of his underlying cancer. CHF
exacerbation was considered the most likely diagnosis given his
elevated BNP, pulmonary congestion on x-ray, known diastolic
dysfunction, and respiratory distress. CXR found evidence of
pulmonary congestion. [**Age over 90 **] showed an LEVF of >55%, unchanged from
prior. He initially presented with an elevated lactate, which
improved after a 500cc bolus. However, he continued to be volume
overloaded, and was diuresed with IV lasix with improvement in
his symptoms. Over the first 24 hours, his oxygen requirement
decreased and he was successfully weaned from bipap. Afterload
reduction was achieved with diltiazem (initially via a diltiazem
drip). Health care associated pneumonia was also considered
considered as a source of his symptoms given that he had an
isolated fever to 101F in the ED. He was started empirically on
vancomycin/zosyn/azythroycin, but this was discontinued after
four days because he remained afebrile and did not have a
leukocytosis or findings suggestive of PNA on CXR. To evaluate
for PE, he underwent LENIs and [**Age over 90 **], both of which were negative.
Given his elevated Cr, we did not pursue a CTA. He was given
standing atrovent nebulizers for a possible COPD exacerbation.
After transfer to the floor, the patient had an episode of
hypertension, tachycardia and flash pulmonary edema and required
IV lasix and his diltiazem was increased for further rate
control and blood pressure control. His diltiazem was restarted
and titrated to achieve a heart rate of <100, as discussed
below.  Furosemide was restarted at 20mg PO daily prior to
discharge. Given his renal function and adequate blood pressure
control on diltiazem alone, ACEi and [**Last Name
