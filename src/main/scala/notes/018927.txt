Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Erythromycin Base / Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
REASON FOR MICU TRANSFER: pneumonia; trach-dependent chronic
respiratory failure
.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 43 year old man with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy with chronic respiratory failure s/p
tracheostomy who is ventilator dependent (for chest
expansion/volume, not oxygen). He has been having increasing SOB
and rust-colored sputum from his trach, and has not been as
comfortable with his normal titer volume on his vent (700). He
has had two recent pneumonias, both of which were treated with
ciprofloxacin, the last one approximately 2 weeks ago. These
were managed at home by his pulmonologist. Today, given the
increasing oxygen requirement he went to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5871**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he
was noted to have a leukocytosis (WBC 19.9 with 87%PMNs) and
lactate 2.6. CXR showed right-sided pneumonia. He was given
vancomycin 1.5g and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given lack of ICU
beds at [**Location (un) 5871**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial VS were: 98.8, 68, 100/64, 16, 100%.
Labs notable for WBC 19.2 (90% PMN) with normal lactate. Initial
ABG was 6.9/113/101/24 on 100% FiO2. He was difficult to
ventilate which was thought to be secondary to the placement of
the trach. He was given vecuronium, his trach was readjusted,
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 42972**] him in the ED and suctioned mucus from
the right lung and BAL was sent. His subsequent ABG were
7.26/34/275/16 on 100% FiO2, and then 7.18/47/128/18. A repeat
CXR confirmed likely right-sided pneumonia. He was given
levofloxacin 750mg IV but developed a rash around the IV, so the
antibiotic was stopped. He was febrile to 101.2 and most recent
VS prior to transfer are: 98, 117/83, 98% on Fi02 100%, PEEP 5,
RR 20, TV 350. He is currently on versed/fentanyl.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is ventilated by the trach.
He is sedated and paralyzed.

Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Duchenne muscular dystrophy
- Chronic respiratory failure s/p trach [**2170**], vent-dependent
- Bronchiectasis
- S/p cardiac arrest in [**2163**] in setting of viral pnumonia, s/p
ICD
- Left ventricular ejection fraction of 37% by cardiac MRI in
[**2173**] at [**Hospital3 1810**]
- H/o ventricular tachycardia [**8-/2180**] (thought most likely due to
an atrial flutter conducting 1:1 across the AV node in the
setting of his baseline abnormal QRS complex)
- Long QT interval
- Right bundle branch block
- Scoliosis
- Cholelithiasis
- S/p open gastrectomy and PEG tube placement
