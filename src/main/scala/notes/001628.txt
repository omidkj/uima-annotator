Chief Complaint:
Variceal bleed stabilized at OSH, TIPS occluded and transferred

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement

TIPS revision


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 52412**] is a 50yo man with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS in
[**1-31**], TIPS redo by IR in [**6-1**] at OSH and again [**1-1**] here.
Presented to OSH with hematemesis. Intubated for airway
protection.  EGD showed gastric bleeding most likely secondary
to gastric varices. He was xferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further mgmt. He
was admitted to the SICU. He was found have TIPS blocked. The
TIPS was revised on [**4-17**]. Pt was started on cotreotide. His HCT
remained stable at 25-26.
.
On ROS, he c/o diarrhea. he says usually he has [**3-29**] BM/day. he
denies N/V/abd pain. he [**Last Name (un) 52413**] CP, SOb, dizziness, palpitations,
dysuria, F/C/C.


Past Medical History:
- HepC w/ cirrhosis - complicated by variceal bleeds s/p
banding.
- TIPS placement [**1-31**] with redo [**6-1**], another balloon dilation
[**1-1**]
- hepatic encephalopathy
- carpel tunnel syndrome
- h/o recurrent cellulitis
- obesity
- mild COPD by PFTs
- diverticulosis
- chronic low back pain [**2-26**] disk protrusion

- h/o substance abuse


Social History:
Lives with his sister. Previously used to work in bakery but
quit in [**Month (only) **] as was too tired to work (was lifting 50lb
bags of flour, etc). Smokes [**1-26**] ppd of cigarettes, no EtOH,
prior heroin use but reports being sober since [**1-31**].
Attempting to quit tobacco and feels like this hospitalization
may prompt change.

Pertinent Results:
[**4-17**] TIPS revision

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate new intimal hyperplasia and stenosis at the hepatic
venous end of the TIPS, clearly flow limiting, with a post
balloon angioplasty persitent portosystemic gradient of 14 mmHg.
Given the persistently elevated gradient and the presence of
large varices as well as the moderate but clearly flow-limting
proximal stenosis, an additional 10 mm Wallstent was deployed,
with subsequent balloon angioplasty of the stent and good
angiographic results. The portosystemic gradient was reduced to
10 mmHg post stent deployment.

Plan: The bleeding risk should be eliminated at the current
time. Careful ultrasonogrphic imaging is recommended, the TIPS
is at risk of failure given the presence of multiple stents
[**4-18**] u/s

IMPRESSION:
1. In comparison to the last study, there is a marked increase
in velocity from 120 to 212 cm/sec with no flow in the left
portal. This represents a new baseline with markedly increased
TIPS velocity. This study cannot exclude an element of stenosis.
2. Thready flow within the stent, which may be technical.
[**4-19**] u/s

IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to body habitus. Patent TIPS
with velocities ranging from 132-140 cm/sec

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50yo man with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS p/w GIB to OSH.
Intubated for airway protection. Found to have TIPS occluded.
TIPS revised. started on octreotide. HCT stable.
.

# Variceal bleed due to TIPS occlusion

As per OSH d/c summary, most likely from variceal bleed. TIPS
was fund to be occluded. TIPS revised on [**4-17**] with good flow on
US. HCT stable for several days, patient discharged with stable
hematocrit and no signs of further bleeding.
.

# HCV Cirrhosis

HCV cirrhosis. recent VL [**2146-3-24**] was 755,000 IU/mL. s/p rx w/
interferon and ribavirin in [**2139**]. relapsed after that. recent
note from Dr [**Name (NI) 32282**] talks about starting rx w/ pegylated
inteferon and ribavirin. COntinued lactulose and rifaximin for
encephalopathy. Refractory ascites s/p TIPS with multiple
revisions and at high risk for further occlussion given multiple
stents placed. Continued lasix and aldactone to manage ascites
and peripheral edema. S/p band ligation of varices, h/o
recurrent variceal bleeding, restarted nadolol. Will follow up
in next 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
