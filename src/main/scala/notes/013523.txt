Allergies:
Zithromax

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 83-year-old Russian-speaking woman with a past
medical history of CAD s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation on warfarin
and amiodarone, 2:1 AV block s/p pacer, systolic CHF (EF 40%),
hypertension, and hypothyroidism, who presented to the ED today
for evaluation of chest pain and elevated blood pressure. The
patient c/o left-sided chest pain, described as a gnawing pain,
worse with deep inspiration, and associated with shortness of
breath today. She took her blood pressure at the time and noted
it to be 170/90 (up from her baseline SBPs of 140), so she took
her double her usual dose of Norvasc. Her blood pressure
improved, but her chest pain continued, so she took 1 sublingual
nitroglycerin, which also did not help her chest pain. She
denied any radiation of the pain, any cough or fevers.
.
She does acknowledge nighttime "spasms" that have been occurring
nightly x2-3weeks. She denies any pain, and notes that the
spasms have been worse in her legs than in her arms. She has
found relief for these spasms with Ambien, which has helped her
relax and then allowed her to sleep. Review of systems is
otherwise completely negative.
.
In the ED: VS - Temp 100.5 F, BP 85/60, HR 100, R 18, O2-sat 99%
RA. Exam was unremarkable, but labs showed a WBC of 12.2 with
neutrophilic predominance, INR 2.4, Cr 1.7 (baseline). UA was +
LE and nitrite with 21-50 WBC and many bacteria. CXR showed a
probable pneumonia in the RML and ? LLL. Trop was elevated to
0.31. [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] was consulted, who felt that the pt did not need a
heparin gtt and that the troponin leak was in the setting of her
renal failure and ongoing infections. She is being admitted to
the ICU for further care given her low blood pressures,
infections, and troponin leak.

TTE: [**2156-8-19**]
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal [**1-8**]
of the left ventricle (LVEF 40-45%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-11-18**],
the left ventricular systolic function is similar (diastolic
function is worsened). The severity of mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation may have increased. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure also increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
83-yo Russian-speaking woman w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, A-fib,
AV-block s/p pacer, sCHF, HTN, and hypothyroidism, who p/w chest
pain that has since resolved, but also w/ hypotension, UTI,
pneumonia, and a troponin leak.
.
#. Hypotension - The patient originally presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
hypotension to SBP 90s, down from her baseline in the 140s. Per
report of the patient, she had noted elevated SBPs to 170s-180s
in the setting of her chest pain and took double her prescribed
dose of Norvasc.  Upon presentation to the ED, the patient given
2L of NS and which alleviated her hypotension and maintained her
urine output. The patient was originally sent to the MICU to r/o
septic etiologies for her hypotension, but was subsequently
transf
