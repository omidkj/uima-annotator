History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] is a 69 year old male who recently [**Known lastname 1834**] CABG
on [**2131-5-4**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. His postoperative course was
relatively uneventful. Since discharge, he has been concerned
about his chest incision. Patient stated he felt a "click" when
he coughed. He also noted a small amount of erythema and serous
drainage. His temperature at home has been at most, 100 F. He
has been short of breath with increasing fatigue and unable to
do his daily chores. Given the above complaints, he presented to
the ED and was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and
treatment.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-5-13**] Chest CT Scan: Sternal dehiscence with an extensive
fluid collection extending along the entire length of the
sternum. While this measures simple fluid density, infection
cannot be excluded. Bilateral pleural effusions measuring simple
fluid density.
[**2131-5-17**] Echo: There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2131-5-18**] LE U/S: 1. RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Extensive thrombosis
of the right femoral vein along its entire length and no
significant internal flow. 2. LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: No evidence
for DVT.
[**2131-5-18**] Echo: The right atrium is moderately dilated. A
mass/thrombus associated with a catheter/pacing wire is seen in
the right atrium and/or right ventricle. This mass disappeared
later in the exam. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small and
hyperdynamic. There is mild LVH. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch
and the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. All findings discussed
with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**2131-5-24**] UE U/S: Persistent areas of intraluminal thrombus in the
left IJ, and within the superficial veins of the left and right
cephalic veins, and new thrombus in the superficial left basilic
vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] was admitted [**5-12**] with sternal instability and
[**Month/Day (1) 1834**] chest CT scan which confirmed sternal dehiscence. It
was also notable for an extensive fluid collection extending
along the entire length of the sternum. He was empirically
started on antibiotics and taken to the operating room on [**5-15**]
for sternal re-wiring. There was no evidence of sternal wound
infection. Postoperatively, he was maintained on antibiotics and
wound irrigation. On [**5-17**] in the early AM, he became acutely
hypotensive and increased his chest tube drainage. Transferred
to the CSRU, Swan placed, and transfused one unit. Emergent Echo
revealed a moderate sized pericardial effusion that appeared
circumferential. His chest was ultimately opened emergently in
the unit for washout, and returned to the OR for complete
washout and a hole in the vein graft was sutured closed. Please
see op reports for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the with open chest and plastic surgery was
consulted regarding sternal plating. The following day he was
brought back to the operating room for chest closure. Echo done
at that time revealed an acute Pulmonary Embolism/Thrombus in
the RA/RV. This mass/thrombus disappeared later on exam. He then
[**Month/Year (2) 1834**] sternal plating closure/bil. pectoralis flaps done by
plastic surgery. Following surgery he was again transferred back
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Argatroban started for
presumed HIT (eventually came back negative) and Hematology
consulted. On [**5-21**] he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Following extubation a
bedside swallow study was done, which he initially failed, but
repeated [**5-23**] with improvement. Also on [**5-23**] he was transferred
to the SDU for further care. Extremity U/S revealed thrombus in
his right femoral vein, left IJ, superficial veins of the left
and right cephalic veins, and in the superficial left basilic
vein. On [**5-24**] a PICC line was placed. Although operative wound
cultures were eventually negative, per ID, he will receive 4
weeks of vancomycin for high risk of sternal contamination. He
continued to improve and worked with physical therapy during his
post-op course for strength and mobility. On [**5-25**] he was
discharged to rehab facility with the appropriate follow-up
appointments. Of note, he will remain on Coumadin for DVT/PE for
minimum of 6 months.
