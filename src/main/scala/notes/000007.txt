Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Resting bradycardia
for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. A left atrial appendage
thrombus cannot be excluded. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.5 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a small left pleural effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
OR.

POST-BYPASS:
For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine and was AV paced.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 11 mmHg and cardiac output of 2.6 L/min). Trivial central
aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are
normal.
3. Right ventricular systolic function post-bypass is moderately
hypokinetic.
4. The intra-atrial septum is dynamic.
5. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.

Final Report
STUDY: Single portable AP chest radiograph.

INDICATION: 82-year-old female status post CABG and chest tube
removal.

COMPARISON: [**2187-7-18**].

FINDINGS: Patient has been extubated with removal of right
basilar chest tube
and Swan-Ganz catheter/NG tube. Atelectasis at the left lower
lobe has
improved. Small left pleural effusion remains. The upper lungs
remain clear.
Bilateral subclavian artery calcifications are again noted.
Median sternotomy
wires remain in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval removal of multiple lines and tubes without
pneumothorax.
2. Improvement of left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Residual small left pleural effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to cardiac surgery. Dental consult was called
and tooth extractions were recommended. On [**7-15**] she had 5 teeth
extracted. On [**7-17**] she was taken to the operating room on [**7-17**]
where she underwent a redo sternotomy and AVR. She was
transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She as extubated on
POD #1. Chest tubes removed and she was transferred to the floor
on POD #2 to begin increasing her activity level. She was gently
diuresed toward her preop weight. Beta blockade was titrated.
Pacing wires removed on POD #3.She had several episodes of A fib
and coumadin was started. Target INR 2.0-2.5. She continued to
make good progress and was cleared for discharge to rehab on POD
#6. Pt. is to make all followup appts. as per discharge
instructions.
