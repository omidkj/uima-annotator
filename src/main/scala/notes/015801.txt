Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
End stage renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Kidney biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, 84 year-old female with suspected cholangiocarcinoma
and CKD (baseline creatinine 1.7-1.8) admitted for acute on
chronic kidney failure.  On day prior to presentation, patient
was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in [**Hospital1 18**] renal clinic.  Routine labs
drawn and patient was found to have worsening creatinine,
metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis.  Urine microscopy showed
muddy brown casts.  Patient was requested to go to ED for
further managment.

At [**Location (un) **], UA was suspicious for UTI.  For hyperkalemia, she
received Kayexylate, calcium gluconate, insulin, bicarbonate,
and levofloxacin.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.

In the ED,  98.1 92 109/58 14 93%RA.  Physical examination
reportedly unremarkable.  Laboratory data significant for
creatinine 9.8 -> 9.3 (baseline 3.8), potassium 6.6 -> 5.0, WBC
21.0 -> 18.3, hematocrit 31.4 -> 25.0, lactate 1.9.  UA with
blood, proteinuria and no evidence of infection.  Blood and
urine cultures sent.  Foley placed.  EKG reportedly with no
acute changes.  CXR 2V reportedly with no acute changes.  CT
abdomen/pelvis without contrast (reportedly performed to rule
out urinary obstruction) remarkable for bilateral pleural
effusions, small pericardial effusion, and no evidence of
obstruction.  Receiving NS at 150cc/hour; levofloxacin at OSH.
On transfer to medicine service, afebrile, 87, 120/50, 24, 97%
2L.  Had BM prior to leaving ED.

On medicine service, patient reports fatigue x2 weeks.  ROS
otherwise negative.  She denies fever, chills, cough, chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea.  Also denies decreased urine output, dysuria, or
hematuria.  Denies decreaed urine output.

[**2138-7-14**] KIDNEY NEEDLE BIOPSY: Pauci-immune crescentic
glomerulonephritis
Light Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex and
medulla, containing approximately 42 glomeruli, of which 32 are
globally sclerotic (some of which show fragmentation of the
[**Hospital1 **] consistent with a prior crescentic process).  Of the
remainder, about 4 show cellular crescents, and 4 show
fibrocellular crescents.  There is diffuse interstitial
inflammation (mixed cellularity, eosinophils are not prominent),
that makes is difficult to judge the extent of interstitial
fibrosis and tubular atrophy, but it is at least moderate.
Arteries show moderate-marked intimal fibroplasia.  Arterioles
show moderate-marked mural thickening, some with hyaline change.
No active vasculitis is seen.
Immunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex,
containing approximately 6 glomeruli, of which 4 are globally
sclerotic.  There is 0-trace mesangial staining for IgG, IgA,
C3, Kappa, and Lambda.  IgM and C1q are negative. 1+C3 is seen
along tubular basement membranes and in vessels.
Albumin is non-contributory.  One glomerulus shows fibrin
positivity consistent with a crescent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67900**] is an 84 yoF with history of hepatic adenocarcinoma
s/p resection and CKD (baseline creatinine 1.7-1.8) who was
admitted for acute on chronic kidney failure.  On day prior to
presentation, patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in [**Hospital1 18**] renal
clinic.  Routine labs drawn and patient was found to have
worsening creatinine, metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis.
Urine microscopy showed muddy brown casts.  Patient was
requested to go to ED for further managment.

When Ms. [**Known lastname 67900**] was admitted, she had a Cr of 9.3.  She received
a renal biopsy, which showed pauci-immune crescentic
glomerulonephritis.  Treatment with steroids was deferred at the
time of diagnosis because of multiple infections (see below) and
was ultimately decided to be of little utility due to high risks
in the setting of multiple infections, amount of time elapsed
from the time of diagnosis, and the advanced stage of scarring
seen on biopsy.  HD was initiated.  Complications included
removal of 4 HD catheters, the first of which she pulled out
while delirius, the second of which was changed for catheter
failure, and the third bled from inlet site, and the fourth of
which she agian pulled out while delirious.  There were multiple
failed attempted at HD due to hypotension/bradycardia and line
malifunction.  CVVH was not considered a treatment option given
the

Her hospital course was also complicated by UTI and two
pneumonias (community acquired PNA treated on admission with
levofloxacin, and later hospital-acquired pneumonia treated with
flagyl, cefepime, and vancomycin).  She developed bilateral
lower extremity DVT's and was started on heparin ggt.  Despite
being therapeutic, she subsequently developed DVT in her right
arm as well as her right IJ extending to the tunneled HD line.
There was concern she may have Trousseau's given her history of
malignancy.

Given all of the above factors and her inability to tolerate
hemodialysis with little chance of recovery of renal function
given the degree of her RPGN, the palliative care team was
consulted and goals of care were readdressed.  She was made
"comfort measures only" in the hospital and discharged with home
hospice under her family's care.  She had mild uremic symptoms
on discharge, including nausea and confusion, as well as a 4L
oxygen requirement thought to be from volume overload.
