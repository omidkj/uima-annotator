CT Head [**2125-1-11**]
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage in the bifrontal
regions, also with
subdural hemorrhage layering along the falx, the tentorium and
along the right
occipital region.
2. Non-displaced right occipital bone fractures with associated
pneumocephalus.
3. Transverse/oblique right temporal bone fracture involving the
mastoid air
cells with opacification of the mastoid air cells, the middle
ear, and
external auditory canal. Dedicated temporal bone CT is
recommended for further
evaluation and to evaluate for ossicular injury.
4. Increased density is seen along a portion of the expected
course of the
right MCA. While [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears
preserved, if
there is a concern for acute infarction, MRI would be
recommended.

Findings were initially discussed with the trauma team and also
posted on the
ED dashboard via CCC upon completion of the study.

CT Cervical spine [**2125-1-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive degenerative changes, particularly at the
atlantoaxial and
craniocervical junction. Findings raise the possibility of
rheumatoid
arthritis and clinical correlation recommended.
2. Slight rotation of C1 with respect to C2 could be positional,
although
rotary subluxation cannot be excluded. Otherwise, cervical
alignment is
preserved.
3. Evidence of old trauma. Degenerative changes and old trauma
makes
evaluation for subtle nondisplaced acute fractures difficult.
Multiple foci
of linear lucencies are identified as described above, which
could represent
old fractures. In this patient with multiple other injuries, MRI
would be
recommended to evaluate for evidence of acute cervical injury.
4. Left occipital bone fracture with associated pneumocephalus.
5. Right temporal bone fracture with opacification of mastoid
air cells in
the middle ear and external auditory canal as seen on CT head.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Numerous bilateral rib fractures, minimally displaced,
without evidence of
pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion. Tiny right pleural right
pleural
effusion.
2. Transverse process fractures in the lumbar spine.
3. Compression deformities of T8 and L1 of indeterminate
chronicity.
4. Cysts within the liver, spleen, and kidneys.
5. Extensive atherosclerotic disease without evidence of
vascular injury.
6. Enlarged prostate.
7. Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.

MRI Cervical and Lumbar spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive degenerative changes with moderate spinal stenosis
at C3-4 level
with extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord and increased
signal within the
cord, indicating myelomalacia or cord edema.
2. Extensive degenerative changes at the craniocervical junction
with
degenerative pannus indenting the thecal sac resulting in mild
spinal
stenosis.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes at other levels as described
above.
4. No MRI evidence of ligamentous disruption. Although
evaluation for subtle
fractures would be difficult on MRI, no obvious abnormalities
are seen on
recent CT.

LUMBAR SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images of the
lumbar spine were acquired.

FINDINGS: At T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1, mild degenerative change
is seen. The
L1 vertebra demonstrates moderate compression with mild
retropulsion of the
posterior superior portion. There is no evidence of increased
signal seen on
the inversion recovery images indicative of chronic compression.


At L1-2, L2-3 and L3-4, degenerative disc disease identified
with mild
bulging. At L3-4, there is a small protrusion within the
inferior portion of
right foramen with mild narrowing.

At L4-5, disc bulging and facet degenerative changes are
identified resulting
in mild spinal stenosis. There is a disc protrusion in the right
foramen
deforming the exiting right L4 nerve root.

At L5-S1 level, severe facet degenerative changes have resulted
in mild
spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1. A disc protrusion in the left
foramen
results in severe foraminal narrowing.

The distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fracture in the lumbar region. Chronic
compression
fracture of L1 vertebra identified with mild retropulsion.
2. Disc protrusion in the right foramen at L4-5 and in the left
foramen at
L5-S1 level deforming the exiting right L4 and left L5 nerve
roots
respectively.
3. Mild spinal stenosis at L4-5 level.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes at other levels as above.

[**2125-1-17**]
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
pulse wave
Doppler of the right upper extremity were performed to evaluate
for deep
venous thrombosis. The right subclavian vein, internal jugular
vein, brachial
veins demonstrate normal respiratory phasicity of flow.
Responses to
augmentation and Valsalva maneuvers are appropriate. The right
basilic vein
contains occlusive thrombus along a several centimeter segment.

IMPRESSION: Thrombus in the right basilic vein (superficial
vein).





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11674**] presented to hospital after being found at bottom of
steps by his family, noted to be A&Ox2 at that time. He was
admitted to the Trauma Service and underwent CT imaging showing
bilateral subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhages, right
mastoid fracture, right lateral rib fractures, L1 transverse
process fracture, L2 severe compression fracture of undetermined
chronicity. He also was noted to have a scalp laceration which
was stapled. He was admitted to the ICU for observation;

Neurosurgery was consulted, serial head CT scans were followed
and he was given Dilantin. A repeat CT obtained [**1-12**] was
unchanged. The Dilantin will cont
