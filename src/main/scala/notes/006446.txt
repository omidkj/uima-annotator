CT abdomen and pelvis: non contrast:
Limited assessment without administration of IV contrast.
1. Peripancreatic fat stranding adjacent to edematous pancreas
with diffusely scattered calcifications, compatible for acute on
chronic pancreatitis. Please obtain a lipase level for
correlation. Slight wall-thickening of duodenum, likely due to
adjacent inflammatory process.
2. 17 x 14 mm cystic structure abutting pancreatic tail is
consistent with a pseudocyst, but MRCP may be obtained for
further evaluation when clinically appropriate.
3. Hyperdense material within gallbladder, likely sludge. No
evidence of cholecystitis.
4. 1.6-cm hyperdense structure in right pelvic floor, possible a
Bartholin's gland cyst.
5. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
6. Calcified fibroids.
7. At least 3 right renal simple cysts, measuring up to 4.2 cm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:

73 yo F w/ CKD stage IV, HTN, anemia who presents with atypical
abdominal pain and metabolic acidosis found to have radiologic
findings suggestive of acute on chronic pancreatitis and
admitted to MICU for monitoring, then transferred to the floor
for further evaluation and management of her abdominal symptoms.

Active Diagnoses:

#Abdominal pain, unknown etiology-resolved:
Pt??????s LLQ abdominal pain, non-bilious emesis, and poor po intake
are not easily attributable to her radiologic finding of
pancreatic inflammation, calcification, and pancreatic
fluid-filled cyst (of note there are no gallstones).  She does
not fit the [**1-31**] criteria for pancreatitis as her lipase is WNL
and her pain pattern is atypical for pancreatitis.  Appreciated
GI input and recommended outpt MRCP (emailed her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 4888**] to evaluate for anomalous pancreas anatomy such as
pancreas divisum that may cause her radiologic findings of
chronic pancreatitis.  It is unlikely this is related to
alcoholic pancreatitis (she denies alcohol x2yrs) or
medications(previous ACEI use>1 mon ago).  Her abdominal
symptoms resolved with 2L IVF bolus, analgesia, and NPO
overnight.  Although unlikely infectious cause, work-up was
started, urine cx & blood cx still pending.  Of note, her
triglycerides were within normal limits and KUB ruled out any
intestinal obstruction.  Her pain may have been caused by
constipation as she had not had a bowel movement for 1 week
prior to admission and her symptoms began to resolve after
having several bowel movements (4 total during this admission).

#Metabolic Acidosis-resolving:
Anion-gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to CKD stage IV.
Anion gap closing with fluid resuscitation.  Her phosphate
binders were restarted and she resumed a renal diet.

#Hypoxia:
Patient presented with SOB on admission requiring 2L NC.  No
prior episodes per pt and she is not on home O2. Probable cause
is underlying COPD as she is a chronic smoker.  Less likely PE
or PNA as she is not tachycardic or without chest pain and CXR
was negative.  She was weaned off of O2 while on the floor and
was satting > 95%.

#Acute on chronic kidney disease:
Patient has known CKD stage IV [**1-30**] HTN. Creatinine trended
downwards from 3.7 on admission, not yet back to baseline of 2.8
(on discharge was 3.3). Her CKD medications for calcium, vitamin
D and phosphate binding were restarted.  Her nephrologist was
notified via email of her admission.

#Weight loss:
Patient was noted to have lost 12 lbs over the past year in the
context of gradually decreasing weight over the past decade.
She is up to date on all cancer screening (mammogram,
colonoscopy, pap smear).  Given 52-pack-year smoking history,
lung cancer is of concern although she had a normal CXR on
admission.  A likely cause of her weight loss however is
malabsorption from chronic pancreatitis and work-up for this as
an outpatient with GI should be considered.

Chronic Diagnoses

#Hypertension:
Her HTN is [**1-30**] CKD. Antihypertensive meds were held on the MICU
and medicine floor as needed as SBPs were 100s-110s.  Should
restart upon discharge.

#Anemia:
Pt has Hct baseline in the low 30s.  No significant change. Most
recent iron studies several mo ago reveal AOCD. She is managed
on Epo and iron in outpt.  Continued ferrous sulfate and
darbopoetin during
