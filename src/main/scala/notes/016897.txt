IMAGING:
CXR [**2106-3-28**]: FINDINGS: A single bedside radiograph of the chest
excludes the lateral most portions of the left lung from the
field of view. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion is seen
without focal consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal
consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
64-year-old man with COPD, CAD, HTN here with several days of
shortness of breath, productive coughs, fever, most likely COPD
exacerbation in the setting of an infection.
.
# COPD exacerbation: Patient was on BiPAP initially but quickly
weaned to 5L NC, breathing comfortably. ABG 7.35/59/64 suggested
chronic respiratory acidosis.  He  was given standing albuterol
nebs q2h, standing ipratropium nebs q6h, prednisone 40 mg qday.
He was initially treated with empiric levofloxacin and
ceftriaxone given requirement for ICU admission.  However,
nasopharyngeal aspirate demonstrated RSV, which was more likely
the trigger.  Thus, antibiotics were stopped.  His breathing and
cough improved significantly over the next several days, and he
was discharged home with supplemental oxygen.  He was also given
a prednisone taper and instructed to start spiriva as well as
advair.  Smoking cessation counseling was provided and the
patient started on a nicotine patch.  He was instructed to
follow-up in pulmonary clinic after discharge.
.
# RSV infection: Initially treated with empiric antibiotics for
CAP, which were stopped when respiratory viral antigen returned
positive for RSV.  He was treated symptomatically with
supplemental oxygen and anti-tussive agents, as well as
prednisone and nebulizers for COPD as above.
.
# CAD s/p PCI in [**2098**]:  The patient was started on ASA 81 mg
daily.
.
# HTN:  HCTZ was continued.
.
# Anxiety: Diazepam and trazodone qhs were continued.
.
# GERD: Continued on home regimen of omeprazole.
.
# Cystinuria: Diagnosed at age 19, with history of multiple
kidney stones.  During this admission, the patient reported
intermittent right groin pain consistent with his pain from
prior kidney stones.  He was treated with gentle IV fluids, and
continued on home dose of penicillamine.
.
Code status was addressed, and he was full code throughout this
hospital stay.
