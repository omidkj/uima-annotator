   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-26**] 9:20 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p D/C chest tubes; Eval for pneumothorax

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man s/p CABG/AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p D/C chest tubes; Eval for pneumothorax
INDICATION: 70-year-old man status post CABG/IVR. Status post
removal of chest tube. Question pneumothorax.

PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is interval
removal of both left-sided chest tubes. There is no evidence for
pneumothorax. There has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz
catheter, with the sheath still remaining in place. The NG tube
has been removed. Again seen is a widened superior mediastinum
due to postoperative changes. There are low lung volumes and
persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Removal of tubes and lines as described. No
pneumothorax. Persistent left basal atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body
of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in
the body of the
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary
veins
identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. No
spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the RA. No spontaneous echo contrast in
the body of
the RA or RAA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. The IVC is normal
in diameter
with appropriate phasic respirator variation.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
root. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Moderate AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Physiologic MR (within
normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Physiologic
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
PRE CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial
appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
right atrium
or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal
limits). There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
Preserved biventricular systolic function. Bioprosthesis in
aortic position.
Well seated and mechanicall y stable. Trace perivalvular aortic
regurgitation.
Mean gradient across the bioprosthesis= 18mm. Hg. Trace mitral
regurgitation
and teace tricuspid regurgitation. No other change.
