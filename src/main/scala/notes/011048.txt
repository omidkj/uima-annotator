Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
frontal ICH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8494**] is an 88-year-old man with a history of a fib on
Coumadin who presents with speech difficulty and lethargy and
was found to have a left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. He
was in his USOH until around 7 pm tonight. After dinner, he
complained to his wife of being tired. Shortly after, he stopped
talking and seemed very lethargic. He was not seen to have any
seizure activity. EMS was called, and he was transported to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**]. There, NCHCT showed ~4 cm diameter left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. INR was found to be 3.4. He was
given 10 mg Vitamin K, 1 unit FFP, 2 inches of nitropaste (BP
178/81), and loaded with 1 gram of dilantin IV.

ROS not possible in detail; generally he says he feels "pretty
good" but does not elaborate.

NCHCT [**2113-1-1**], 12:02 am:
FINDINGS:  There is a large left frontal cerebral hemorrhage
measuring
approximately 4.9 x 4 cm with significant surrounding vasogenic
edema.  There
is at least approximately 5 mm of midline shift and
effacement/mass effect
upon the ipsilateral and contralateral frontal horns of the
lateral
ventricles.  There is effacement of the left mesencephalic
cistern worrisome
for early uncal herniation.  Within the apex there is
hypoattenuation within
the subcortical white matter on the right.  This may represent a
region of
post op-cystic encephalomalacia as patient has right craniotomy
changes in the
osseous structures of this region.

There is a left maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst.  The
paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are otherwise clear.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Large left frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhage with mass
effect upon the surrounding cortex and frontal horns of the
lateral ventricles.  Effacement of the left perimesencephalic
cistern on the ipsilateral side is concerning for early uncal
herniation.

2.  Hypoattenuation within the subcortical white matter of the
right parietal lobe is likely secondary to cystic
encephalomalacia from previous surgery.

MRI head [**2113-1-1**]:
FINDINGS:

Again noted is a large subacute hematoma in the left frontal
lobe causing
subfalcine herniation, of approximately 9 mm, which is unchanged
compared to the prior study.  There is significant surrounding
edema and a small sliver of an extra-axial fluid collection.

No enhancing abnormality is seen to suggest an underlying mass.
There is restricted diffusion within the hematoma which can be
seen with
subacute hematomas.

There are a few scattered foci of signal dropout in a punctate
fashion in the left temporal and parietal lobes, which have
progressed since the prior study. These could be related to
amyloid angiopathy or old hypertensive microbleeds, if the
patient has the appropriate clinical history.

Again noted are changes from a right frontal craniotomy,
reportedly for
meningioma resection.  There are encephalomalacic changes but no
evidence for recurrent or residual neoplasm.


No uncal herniation seen on this examination.

There are scattered small vessel ischemic sequelae in the
subcortical and
periventricular white matter and grossly stable since the prior
examination.

Intracranial flow voids are maintained.

There is a small left maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst.

IMPRESSION:

Large subacute left frontal hematoma with no definite underlying
mass noted.

Mild progression of punctate foci of signal dropout on the left
temporal and
parietal lobes with differential diagnostic considerations as
above.

Postoperative sequela in the right frontal lobe with no evidence
for residual
or recurrent neoplasm.

NCHCT [**2113-1-1**], 8:27 pm:
FINDINGS:  There is no significant change in size, appearance,
or mass effect
of a large left frontal cerebral hemorrhage with surrounding
vasogenic edema.
No intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus is present.
There is
unchanged appearance to the intracranial cisterns.

NCHCT [**2113-1-2**]:
FINDINGS:  Again seen is a large left frontal parenchymal
hemorrhage.  There has been a gradual increase in the amount of
surrounding edema, as expected in the 24-48 hour period
following an acute hemorrhage.  Subfalcine herniation remains
unchanged at approximately 6 mm.  The cisterns remain normal.
Mass effect on the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle
is also unchanged.

In addition, there has been no interval change in
encephalomalacia of the
right frontal lobe, adjacent to the old craniotomy.

IMPRESSION:  Expected evolution of left frontal lobe parenchymal
hemorrhage, with small increase in surrounding edema.  No other
interval
