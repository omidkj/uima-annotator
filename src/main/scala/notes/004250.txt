Chief Complaint:
elevated BGs, and chest pain

Central Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
77 yoM with CLL, DM type I with insulin pump, HTN, afib who p/w
SOB, R sided pleuritic chest and shoulder pain, and elevated
BGs. History obtained from patient's son as patient is not able
to answer questions upon arrival to MICU. By report, patient has
been feeling fatigued over the last week. He was seen by his
outpatient Oncologist just after [**Holiday 1451**] and had bloodwork
performed which showed an elevated WBC count. He had been
scheduled to start Chlorambucil 8 days ago. However, as he and
his family were travelling to [**Location (un) 26833**] over the weekend, he did
not want to start the medication. He was in [**Location (un) 26833**] from
Fri-Mon and returned yesterday. He spent much of the flight on
his feet due to chronic pain in his knees. Yesterday evening,
patient ate dinner with his son and was still doing well. He
fell into [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] but this was a witnessed fall and had no head
trauma or LOC. This am, patient called his son at 8 am stating
that he was aching all over and felt SOB w/ pleuritic R sided
chest and shoulder pain. He also noted to his son that his blood
sugars had been in the 300s and 400s which was unusual for him.
His son then brought him to his [**Name (NI) 6435**] office who brought him to
the ED.
.
In the ED, T, 99.0, BP 116/40, HR 85, RR 16, O2 96% RA. He was
found to have elevated leukocytosis compared to prior values in
our system. CXR showed e/o RLL pna w/ a R sided effusion. He was
given ceftriaxone and azithromycin. EKG with ST depressions in
inferior and lat leads, worse than prior. His first set of
cardiac enzymes were negative. He received 1 SL NTG which had no
effect on chest pain but led to hypotension w/ SBP to 70s. He
received 1 LNS w/ SBPs to 80s. Given persistent hypotension, he
was started on the sepsis protocol and a R IJ CVL was placed.
Around the same time, he developed severe abdominal pain. He
complained of [**11-16**] epigastric abdominal pain and reportedly had
a distended, firm abdomen. He received 1 percocet, 2 mg of
morphine, and 2 mg of dilaudid with improved abdominal and chest
pain but worse mental status. He received a abdominal XR and an
abdominal CT without contrast which showed no acute
abnormalities. His SBP rose to 110s after 4 L of NS. His abdomen
once again was soft and his abdominal pain did not return.

IMAGING:
[**2130-1-17**] CXR
IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia with likely small right
parapneumonic effusion.
.
[**2130-1-17**] Abdominal XRAY
IMPRESSION:  Normal bowel.  Infiltrates at both bases.  DJD in
the lumbar
spine.  Metallic device lateral to the left hip.
.
[**2130-1-17**] ABDOMINAL/PELVIS CT
IMPRESSION:

1.  No acute intra-abdominal process to explain the patient's
pain.
2.  Severe splenomegaly and marked lymphadenopathy,
predominantly in the
mesenteric nodal station.  No evidence of splenic rupture.  Lack
of IV
contrast limits evaluation for splenic infarcts.
3.  Extensive right lower lobe pneumonia and a smaller
consolidation in the left lower lobe, which may represent an
additional focus of infection.
4.  Moderate left hydronephrosis of uncertain etiology, but
possibly due to congenital UPJ obstruction. Comparison with
prior outside studies would be helpful to evaluate chronicity of
this process.
