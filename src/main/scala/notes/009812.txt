Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
diaphagmatic hernia with left lung collaspe and decompression

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
flexible and rigid bronch for therpauetic aspiration and stent
placement.
Diaphragmatic hernia repair and G-tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6358**] is an unfortunate 55-year-old woman
with mild mental delay and obesity who also has
kyphoscoliosis and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with
a dense left pneumonia and was found to have very large
pulmonary arteries but also her entire stomach in a
transverse fashion in the thorax with associated omentum and
transverse colon, representing a type 4 hernia. This
distended stomach compressed the left main bronchus against
the pulmonary artery and resulted in total collapse of the
left lung. She was palliated with a silicone stent and
aggressive daily bronchoscopy to re-aerate the left lung and
improve her hypoxemia. It was recommended that she undergo
reduction and repair of this large paraesophageal hernia.


Past Medical History:
hiatal hernia, ASD, PAH, MR, OSA, seizure disorder, low b12,
scoliosis; s/p open ccy

Social History:
developmentally delayed lives in group home - her brother is her
guardian

Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
general: realatively well appearing scoliotic woman in NAD
Heent: no dentition, neck supple, scoliotic.
Chest: clear on right, decreased throught on left
abd: obese, round, soft, NT, ND
extrem: no LE edema
neuro: pleasant and [**Doctor Last Name **], developmentally delayed, answers
questions approp.

Pertinent Results:
CT scan: [**2195-7-4**] IMPRESSION:

1. Large amount of retained secretions causing near complete
occlusion of left mainstem bronchi stent with complete left lung
collapse and corresponding leftward mediastinal shift.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly
changed from [**6-18**] examination.

2. Unchanged appearance to dilatation of the pulmonary arteries
consistent with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.

3. Slightly decreased findings of anasarca and haziness of the
upper abdomen mesentery. Unchanged appearance to known hiatal
hernia. Resolution of small adjacent pneumothorax.

cxr [**2195-7-9**]
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2195-7-8**]. Slight
improvement in the complete collapse of the left lobe, though
the distal portion of the left main stem bronchus is still not
well-visualized. Right lung appears better aerated today; there
is some residual fluid and/or atelectasis near the minor
fissure. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are not well
evaluated, but the visualized portion is probably unchanged.
Osseous structures are similar to previous study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2195-6-9**] a chest XRAY revealed Severe
tracheobronchomalacia. The left bronchial tree is totally
obstructed, whether by severe bronchomalacia, or by a long
stricture is not clear. The left lung is collapsed. Large hiatal
hernia containing the entire stomach as well as a loop of colon.
Markedly dilated pulmonary arteries. After some discussion w/
interventional pulmonogy it was decided to place a silicone
stent in the left main stem bronchus to improve aeration prior
to surgical hernia repair. After agressive pulmonary tiolet pt
was taken to the OR [**2195-6-17**] for Esophagogastroscopy,Laparotomy
with reduction of type 4 hiatal hernia, repair of hiatus, Toupet
partial fundoplication,Tube gastrostomy, Toilet bronchoscopy.
Post op course was complicated by prolonged intubation for
pulmonary toilet in the SICU. Pt was then successfully extubated
and remained hemodyamnically stable and was transferred from the
ICU. She continued to require aggressive pulmonary toilet w/
serial flexible bronchoscopies for therapeutic aspiration of
left lung. despite aggressive bronchs for pul toilet the
secretions in the left lung did not clear. All BAL's were neg
and wbc remained flat. The decision was made to remove the
silicon stent as secretions were accumulating in the stent
further complicating the problem. her CXR showed minimal
aeration in the upper lobe post stent removal.  Attempts were
made to open the left lung with non-invasive ventilation, chest
PT, and obtaining a Thera-Vest (the latter could not be obtained
in the hospital, but is recommended as an outpatient)
She progressed well for an operative standpoint. she is
currently [**Last Name (un) 1815**] reg diet avoiding caffiene, carbonation, and
sweet juices. Her G-tube is a surgical gastric anchor and will
remain in place for 1-2 months andwill be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in follow up. The G-tube should NOT be used for feedings but
should be flushed at least daily. The surgical abd incision
opened slightly at the midportion and is clean and granulating
well w/o any signs of infection.  She will be discharged to a
rehab/[**Hospital1 **] facility where she should reside for less than 30
days.
