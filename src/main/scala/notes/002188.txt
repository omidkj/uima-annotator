Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Plasmpheresis
Ultrafiltration
Intubation
Central Line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 year old male with a history of Osteomylitis of the
right foot (recent admit at [**Hospital1 **]), CAD (s/p MI and stend in [**2161**],
and [**2174**], ?sternotomy?), CHF (?diastolic v. right sided from
PAH/pulm stenosis), moderate pulm artery HTN based on echo,
pulmonic stenosis, A-fib who was recently diagnosed with CML,
not started on treatment yet, who was transferred to [**Hospital 18**]
medical floor on evening of [**5-28**] for further managment of
osteomylitis.
.
On the medical floor a history was moaning and a history and ROS
was unable to be attained.  He was noted to be volume overloaded
and given his respiratory distress he was given lasix.  His
respiratory status continued to decline.  An ABG was 7.28/45/65.
 He was transferred to the unit for respiratory distress.

Pertinent Results:
CYTOGENETICS:
FISH evaluation for a BCR-ABL rearrangement was performed
on nuclei with the Vysis LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual
Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for BCR at
22q11.2 and ABL at 9q34, and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 92/100 nuclei, which exceeds
the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this
probe in our laboratory. A BCR-ABL rearrangement is found
in most cases of CML, and in a subset of cases of ALL and AML.

BONE MARROW BIOPSY:
FISH evaluation for a BCR-ABL rearrangement was performed
on nuclei with the Vysis LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual
Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for BCR at
22q11.2 and ABL at 9q34, and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 95/100 nuclei, which exceeds
the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this
probe in our laboratory. A BCR-ABL rearrangement is found
in most cases of CML, and in a subset of cases of ALL and AML.
.
FOOT X-RAY:
1. Evidence of cortical destruction and loss at the fifth
metatarsal head and neck on the right, either due to
osteomyelitis or prior debridement.
2. Faint lucency through navicular on the right of uncertain
significance.  Correlate with focal symptoms.
3. Some loss of morphology of the right calcaneus is seen, but
no frank
cortical destruction.
4. Probable left fifth metatarsal base fracture.
5. Area of relative lucency and cortical ill definition at the
medial aspect of the left fifth metatarsal head may represent an
area of cortical
destruction due to osteomyelitis, although the appearance is
nonspecific.
.
PATHOLOGY BONE BIOPSY 5th METATARSAL HEAD:
Bone, right fifth metatarsal head (A):Regenerative bone and
fibrous tissue with focal acute inflammation, consistent with
ulcer bed; no acute osteomyelitis seen. Small juxta-trabecular
lymphoid aggregate.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS/CHEST ([**2177-5-30**]):
1. Large left and small right pleural effusions with question of
loculation superiorly, as before, though this come be from
chronic pleural scar.  Interstitial thickening consistent with
mild pulmonary edema.
2. Mild-to-moderate ascites around the liver and tracking into
the pelvis.
Diffuse anasarca, consistent with third spacing.
3. No evidence of acute bowel abnormality. No hemoperitoneum or
pneumoperitoneum to suggest splenic rupture or bowel
perforation.
4. Extensive coronary artery atherosclerotic calcification.
5. Enteric tube sideport situated above GE junction; advance for
standard
positioning.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**6-17**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). The anterior septum appears hypokinetic. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is moderate pulmonic valve stenosis.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Compared with the findings of the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2177-5-30**], no obvious change but the
technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes
definitive comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE [**Date range (3) 47033**]
.
56 yo M with PMH of CHF, PVD, recent dx osteomyelitis on
linezolid and irtepenem, newly dx'ed CML, pulmonic stenosis, CAD
and DM was transferred from an OSH for further management of
CML.  He was initially admitted to the floor and found to have a
white [**Date range (3) **] cell count of 280,000.  He triggered for hypoxia and
delirium several hours after admission and was transfered to the
ICU. He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and
delirium both thought to be [**12-31**] leukostasis.
.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initially thought to be secondary
to pulmonary leukostasis.  Also ulitmately from pulmonary edema
and ventilator associated pneumonia. Was plasmapheresed and
received chemotherapy as below.  Also received significant
hydration in setting of uric acid of 14 and systemic
chemotherapy.  Became massively fluid overloaded requiring
ultrafiltration intermittently. Spiked fevers and was bronched
which showed LLL PNA.  Initially treated with linezolid,
cefepime and cipro which was narrowed to daptomycin and cefepime
to complete treatment for VAP. Stenotrophomonas grew from his
sputum but thought to be a colonizer as was clinially improving
not on bactrim.  He had difficulty weaning from the ventilator
so tracheostomy was placed. With initiation of dialysis /
ultrafiltration and aggressive fluid removal he was able to be
weaned to trach mask. He was off the ventilator for > 24 hours
at the time of discharge.
.
# Leukemia:  Had been newly diagnosed CML prior to admission.
WBC was 280K.  Oncology was consulted on admission and the
patient was treated with Hydrea and Gleevec.  He was started on
allopurinol. He underwent plasmapheresis once.  Peripheral [**Month/Day (2) **]
was bcr-abl positive.  Bone marrow biopsy was not adeuate for
further cytogenetics but was also bcr-abl positive, consistent
with accelerated CML, and he was continued on above treatment.
His white cell count decreased to normal range. In consultation
with the  hematology
