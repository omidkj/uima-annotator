Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 year-old Russian male with a past medical
history significant for multivessel CAD s/p MI '[**45**], s/p OM PCI
to LCX '[**60**], s/p BMS to D1 of LAD '[**66**] with stable exertional
angina, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, diastolic heart
failure, PVD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM2, long history of
medication non-compliance presented with CHF exacerbation,
elevated INR, now transferred to CCU due to asymptommatic
hypotension during diuresis.
.
Per patient, had N/V/Diarrhea 3 days ago reported to be
self-resolving.  After resolution, noted worsening LE edema,
orthopnea, fatigue and decreased PO intake.  No PO intake since
illness.  On day of admission, he was so weak that he crawled to
phone to be brought to ED.  In the ED was found to have slow
atrial fibrillation, unchanged EKG.  CXR with e/o of pulmonary
edema and right sided pleural effusion.  INR was 19.  Due to
back bruise, CT scan done which was negative for RP bleed.
However, did note moderate pericardial effusion.  Echo with no
tamponade physiology. Recieved 10 mg Vitamin K to reverse INR,
Lasix 80 mg IV with 75 cc UOP and admitted to the floor.
.
Overnight, he was placed on lasix gtt with subsequent
hypotension this morning.  Urine output total 261 cc in 12
hours.  Lasix gtt was discotninued and blood pressures improved
to mid-90's, however, no urine output.  Blood pressure slowly
declined to mid-80's off the lasix gtt and now transferred to
CCU.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain,
abdominal pain, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.
