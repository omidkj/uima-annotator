Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
man with past medical history significant for idiopathic
tracheobronchomalacia who was admitted with recurrent
productive cough.  He recently had tracheal stents placed at
[**Hospital6 256**] in [**2148-8-11**] and
was to return for a follow up subsequently.  Since his
discharge, he has had progressively worsening recurrent
cough.  He was admitted to an outside hospital in [**Location (un) 7498**] where a chest x-ray showed a pneumonia and his
sputum culture grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.  He was initially treated with levofloxacin and then
switched to ceftriaxone after sensitivity showed resistance
to levofloxacin.  He does report a copious thick sputum.  On
admission, the patient denied any chest pain, fevers, chills,
or palpitations.  He did report dyspnea, but no oxygen
requirement was noted at home as the patient is on home
oxygen.  The patient also complained of decreased appetite
and poor peroral intake.  The patient did not have any
hemoptysis or hematemesis.  The patient was admitted for
further management of his pneumonia and his airway.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally
admitted to the medicine service.  A chest x-ray obtained on
the day of admission showed small pleural effusions, but no
radiographic evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart
failure.  On [**2148-9-6**], the patient had his Dumon stent removed
from the left main stem bronchus with rigid forceps without
any complications.  In addition, given the diagnosis of
tracheobronchomalacia with bow-string trachea, the patient
underwent right thoracotomy with posterior membranous wall
tracheoplasty with Marlex mesh, tracheostomy tube placement,
flexible bronchoscopy and tracheobronchial aspiration.  The
procedure was without any complications.  Please see the full
operative report for detail.

The patient was started on intravenous vancomycin.  The
aspirate cultures were sent for identification.  The tracheal
aspirate grooves Staphylococcus aureus which was coagulase
positive and sensitive to vancomycin, but resistant to
oxacillin (MRSA).  Respiratory care specialists were
consulted who administered albuterol and Atrovent treatment
for the patient every six hours in the beginning with good
results.  Psychiatry was consulted as well to evaluate for a
possible depression.  The patient continued to have the low
grade fever.  His white count at the time increased to 13.0,
but subsequently decreased.  The patient was maintained on
CPAP.  On [**2148-9-12**], the patient's creatinine was noted to be
rising to 2.3 and eventually reached a peak of 6.7 on
[**2148-9-17**].

Renal service was consulted to manage the patient's acute
renal failure.  The patient underwent a repeat bronchoscopy
on [**2148-9-9**] which showed edema of the vocal cords as well as
severe malacia in the trachea and main stem bronchi with a
moderate amount of white secretions found diffusely which
were removed with suction.  Cardiac surgery was consulted on
[**2148-9-9**] for the evaluation and management of the patient's
tracheomalacia with posterior membranous wall dynamic
collapse.  As noted above on [**2148-9-11**], the patient underwent
posterior membranous wall tracheoplasty with Marlex mesh.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no
complications.  Please see the full operative note for
detail.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  The patient was noted to have a
temperature of 102??????.  Blood cultures were drawn which showed
no growth.  The patient continued to receive periodic
bronchoscopies which continued to show secretions which
decreased in amount.  The patient was originally hypotensive,
but his blood pressure stabilized while he remained in the
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's renal function gradually
improved with decreasing creatinine.  The patient was
hydrated daily.  The patient continued to be intubated.  The
patient's chest tube was removed on postoperative day 4.  The
patient was also started on tube feeds.

Physical therapy was consulted which followed the patient.
The patient appeared to be comfortable on 4 liters nasal
cannula on postoperative day 8 while still in the Intensive
Care Unit.  He was continued on intravenous vancomycin, given
MRSA in his sputum.  The patient's stay in the Intensive Care
Unit was noted for him pulling out his tracheostomy tube.
The patient remained afebrile during the rest of his
hospitalization.  He continued to breathe with less
difficulty.  There were no significant secretions towards the
end of the hospitalization.  The chest x-ray performed on
[**2148-9-23**] showed improved left lower lobe atelectasis with
worsening right upper lobe and right lower lobe
collapse/consolidation.  The waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature of
these findings was thought to be consistent with aspiration.

On [**2148-9-24**], the patient's tracheostomy tube was removed.
The patient continued to do well with supplemental oxygen via
nasal cannula.  He was able to swallow.  However, he still
had relatively poor peroral intake.  In addition, a PICC line
was placed for intravenous antibiotic administration.  The
patient was discharged to the rehabilitation center in stable
condition.
