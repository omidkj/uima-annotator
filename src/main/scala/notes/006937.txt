Service:  BLUE SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 19419**] is a 47-year-old
male, with a past medical history significant for diabetes,
hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, who presented to an
outside hospital with a chief complaint of [**10-25**] chest pain
and ST elevation, consistent with an anterior myocardial
infarction.  At the outside institution, an LAD thrombus was
discovered and stented.  This procedure was complicated by a
right external iliac dissection which was surgically
repaired.  This procedure was complicated by rethrombosis of
the coronary stent that was placed prior to the right iliac
artery injury.  He was then taken back to the cardiac cath
laboratory for restenting.  Lower extremity angiography
obtained during the time of cardiac catheterization showed
that the site of the right external iliac artery
reconstruction was intact.  Following his cardiac procedure,
the patient developed an acute abdomen with abdominal
distention, and a CT which suggested ischemic colitis with
bleeding into the retroperitoneum and intraperitoneal space.

He was transferred to this institution on a balloon pump with
multiple pressors and a systolic pressure in the 70s.  He
subsequently became anuric secondary to prolonged
hypotension.  At the time of transfer, the patient had
received 12 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of FFP,
10 liters of crystalloid.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Status post CVA.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Glucovance.
2. Avandia.
3. Tricor.
4. Lipitor.
5. Altace.
6. Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM - VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 102.0, pulse 100,
blood pressure 153/100, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  In general, the patient was
intubated, sedated, and grossly edematous.  His heart was
tachycardic but regular in rhythm.  His lungs had decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.  His abdomen was extremely
distended and tense to palpation.  His extremities were
grossly edematous.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 28, hematocrit
38, platelet count 130, potassium 6.4, BUN 20, creatinine
1.1, blood sugar 325.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the concern for retroperitoneal
bleed, coagulopathy, cardiac shock, and ischemia, he was
promptly seen by the surgical service for evaluation.  The
patient had elevated bladder pressures at 50, but given his
overall clinical picture, it was agreed that he should be
optimized from a coagulopathy and hemodynamic standpoint
before undergoing exploratory laparotomy.

The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and was
followed closely with regards to his elevated bladder
pressure.  He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics
including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for the
concern of bacterial transmigration secondary to ischemic
colitis.

On hospital day #2, after the patient was having progressive
fevers with a concern for abdominal perforation, he was taken
to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.  The
estimated blood loss for the procedure was 1,000 cc.
Intraoperatively, he received 3,000 cc of crystalloid, 2
units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of FFP, and 6 packs
of platelets.  There was no clot found intraoperatively;
however, there was 2 liters of blood present.  The bowel was
viable with a normal appendix, and there was no evidence of
bleeding at the site of the external iliac repair.

The patient's intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on
hospital day #3.  On hospital day #4, the patient was started
on TPN.  On hospital day #5, the patient was taken back to
the operating room where the abdomen was re-explored and
closed.  He tolerated this procedure well and was discharged
to the cardiac surgery recovery unit, after the delayed
abdominal closure for abdominal compartment syndrome was
performed.  The patient did well postoperatively and
continued to make urine on his own.  He was off pressors by
postoperative days #7 and #4, and was receiving TPN for
parenteral nutrition.  The patient was transitioned from TPN
to tube feedings on postoperative days #8 and #5.  On
postoperative days #9 and #6, the patient was extubated.

He was transferred to the floor on postoperative days #11 and
#8.  At this time, he had sputum cultures which grew
coag-positive staph and pseudomonas, and he was therefore
treated with ceftazidime and vancomycin.  He was advanced to
a regular diet on postoperative days #12 and #9.  At this
time, he was ambulating with the assistance of physical
therapy.

The patient did have some ongoing tachypnea above his
baseline.  A blood gas was performed which demonstrated a
significant AA gradient.  A CT of the chest was done to
assess for PE.  There was a large clot found at the origin of
the right pulmonary artery.  He was, therefore, treated with
a heparin drip with a goal INR of 2.0-2.3.  Given his marked
tachypnea, the patient was transferred back to the intensive
care unit on postoperative days #13 and #10 for closer
monitoring.  He was then transferred back to the floor on
postoperative days #14 and #11, after having an uneventful
ICU course.  At this time, the patient was ambulating
independently and was tolerating a regular diet.  He was
maintained on his heparin drip until he was therapeutic with
his Coumadin, and was eventually discharged to rehab in good
condition.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Diabetes mellitus.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Status post cerebrovascular accident.
4. Acute myocardial infarction.
5. Status post exploratory laparotomy for abdominal
compartment syndrome.
6. Mechanical ventilation.
7. Right pulmonary artery embolus.
8. Oliguria.
9. Parenteral nutrition requirement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg po qd.
2. Captopril 6.25 mg po tid.
3. Plavix 75 mg po qd.
4. Colace 100 mg po bid.
5. Coumadin 5 mg po q hs with a goal INR between 2.0 and 3.0.
6. Regular insulin sliding scale, as instructed.
7. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
8. Protonix 40 mg po qd.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will be transferred to a rehab
facility in the state of [**State 2690**] where he is from.  He will be
following up with his primary care physician at that time.
He was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] if he has any
other questions or concerns.  His staples were removed prior
to discharge.
