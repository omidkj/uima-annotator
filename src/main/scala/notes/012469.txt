Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, fever to 102.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old female with history of atrial
fibrillation s/p recent hospitalization for ablation, discharged
on [**5-18**], who returns with fatigue x 3 days, and fever to 102
with chills on the day prior to admission.  She says that since
discharge s/p ablation, she has felt somewhat "rundown," but
expected this was normal after the procedure and
hospitalization.  She had some constipation relieved by senna.
Of note, about 1 week PTA she noted severe L groin pain.  She
was seen by cardiology who decided to simply monitor, and this
pain resolved over a couple of days.  About 5 days prior to
admission she noted increased fatigue as well as a pressure
sensation in her pelvis with urination.  The following day she
developed further pelvic/abdominal pain, and anorexia.  The
following day she began having chills, and her daughter found
her temperature to be 102 at which point she was brought to the
hospital.

She says that the toilet she has been using was maroon colored,
and she therefore hasn't been able to notice any changes in her
urine color or stool color.  She denies burning with urination,
but has had the suprapubic discomfort.  Denies increased
frequency or urgency.  Denies flank pain beyond her usual
chronic back pain.  She does note increased dyspnea on exertion
over the same time course.  Denies orthopnea or LE edema.  She
has also been feeling very thirsty and drinking a lot of water.

In the ED she had a temp of 102.5, BP 95/78, decreasing to 84/48
with standing, HR 70, 97% RA.  She was given 4 L NS, [**Month/Year (2) 1378**],
and flagyl and sent to the ICU for brief observation.

   ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):

CXR [**5-31**]:  CHEST AP: Compared to the earlier exam, there has
been interval placement of a right IJ CVL. The tip is in the
right atrium. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is
interval increase in interstitial markings and septal lines
consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.

CXR [**5-31**]:  IMPRESSION: Mild CHF. New, lobulated appearance of
left hilum. Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation to
exclude a mass in this region.

CT abdomen [**6-1**]:  IMPRESSION:
1) Foci of decreased enhancement in both kidneys consistent with
pyelonephritis.
2) Left renal cyst and additional low attenuation focus, which
may represent a cyst but is too small to be fully characterized.
3) Bibasilar scarring and atelectasis.

CXR [**6-1**]:  FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with
the patient in upright position is compared with a recent
similar study (half hour interval). The central venous line has
been withdrawn by approximately 5 cm and is now located in the
lower portion of the SVC terminating some 2 cm above the level
of the entrance into the right atrium. No pneumothorax or any
other chest abnormalities in comparison with the previous study.

[**6-2**] US: The gallbladder is normal, and there is no
evidence of stones. The liver is of normal echogenicity and echo
texture
without focal lesions. The common bile duct measures
approximately 3 mm and is within normal limits. There is no
intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. There is no evidence of free
fluid in the abdomen.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation s/p
recent hospitalization for ablation, discharged on [**5-18**], who
returns with fatigue x 3 days, and fever to 102 with chills,
found to have UTI by UA and evidence of pyelonep
