History of Present Illness:
79 yo M with h/o recurrent anaphylactoid reactions in the
setting of viral/bacterial illnesses who now presents with fever
and lethargy.  Pt was in his usual state of health until last
night, when at dinner he was noted to be lethargic with
decreased appetite.  Then this AM he awoke with sore throat and

.
As far as these anaphylactoid episodes are concerned, they date
back to [**2151**] and almost always are preceeded by a viral prodrome
which then progresses to a generalized urticarial rash,
bronchospasm, and hypotension.  He had been admitted several
times to the MICU and treated with steroids, bronchodilators,
pressors, and antihistamines.  He has never been intubated for
the bronchospasms.
.
Pt did have recent episode on [**3-27**]; he presented to ED with 3
days of fever, cough, shoulder pain.  He had started zyrtec and
prednisone 3 days prior.  In the ED he was given levoflox and
steroids; he was offered admission for obs but the pt declined.
He was discharged on a 11-day taper.
.
In ED his BP was 99/48 and he received 1.5 L IVF.  He also
received decadron 10 mg, levoflox, acetaminophen.

Past Medical History:
- h/o frequent infections complicated by anaphylactoid reaction.
 Pt has been noted to develop urticaria, wheezing, and
hypotension in setting of viral or bacterial infections.
Usually treated with steroids and abx.  Has history of ICU
admissions requiring pressors.  This has been evaluated by
allergy/immunology with no clear etiology.

.
CXR [**5-18**]: The heart is enlarged and unchanged.  The mediastinal
and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There has been
interval increase in opacities within the left lower lobe.
Although some of these opacities have a linear configuration
_____ new increase in opacification within this region.  These
findings could represent pneumonia and/or small left pleural
effusion.
.
CXR [**5-18**] Revised report: The heart is enlarged and unchanged.
The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
Tortuous head and neck vessels or a goiter are causing some
tracheal deviation. There are perihilar opacities with some
interstitial markings. These opacities have a linear
configuration likely representing atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Mild CHF. No evidence of pneumonia.
.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
LENI: Grayscale and Doppler examination of the right common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
performed. Normal compressibility, waveforms, augmentation, and
flow is demonstrated. No intraluminal clot is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was originally admitted with a chief complaint of
fevers and a cough.  He was found to have a possible infiltrate
on CXR.  He was treated with levofloxacin for possible CAP, and
given his history of anaphylactoid reactions in the setting of
viral/bacterial illnesses, was treated with [**Doctor First Name 130**], zantac,
steroids, albuterol PRN.  On HD#2, patient was noted to have a
metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.  His ABG was
7.39/28/18 with a lactate of 5.5.  He was also noted to have a
bandemia.  He was diuresed  and Vancomycin was added for broader
coverage.  Blood cultures were sent and steroids were stopped.
Later that evening, patient was noted to be hypotensive (82/42)
and was transferred to the ICU for concern of sepsis,
complicated by volume overload.  His creatinine was also noted
to be up from 1.2 to 1.8.

In the ICU a foley catheter and an arterial line were placed.
He had poor urine output which was treated with multiple IV
fluid boluses with good response.  His blood pressure also
improved iwth IV fluids and remained stable in the low 100's.
He was noted to he hypoxic down to the 80's and he was  treated
with oxygen wby nsal cannula.  The allergy service was consulted
and on their recommendation, steroids were re-started to treat
possible mastocytosis.  They also requested the following labs:
C3, C4, CH50, mast cell tryptase.  These were ordered and
specifically ordered to be added onto patient's admission blood
samples as it was felt that doing the labs on later samples
after time and treatment with steroids would be of no diagnostic
value.  Unfortunately, the [**Doctor First Name **] was unable to find sufficicent
blood to add on all of these labs.  Patient's respiratory
distress resolved as his lactic acidosis improved.  Given the
patient's rapid improvement on steroids, and lack of evidence of
further sources of infection beyond his suspected pneumonia,
Vancomycin was discontinued.  Urine lytes were sent and his
calculated FeNa was consistent with a pre-renal etiology.  His
acute renal failure improved with IV fluids and his creatinine
was trending back down when patient was called out to the floor.
On the floor, the patient continued to do well without any
recurrent symptoms. His platelets were noted to decline by
approximately 50% and a HIT antibody was sent and is which was
positive. Upon review of his old labs during other hopsital
stays, his platetes were noted to trend down on all admission.
All heparin products were stopped. Patient was then started on
