Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VATS Pleurodesis, Central Line Insertion, Arterial Line
Insertion

History of Present Illness:
81 year-old male with recurrent L pleural effusion ?chylothorax,
was in usual state of health, went to the OR with interventional
pulmonology for drainage of the effusion, biopsies, and talc
pleurodesis.  The patient had MAC sedation and a paravertebral
block for pain, required neosynephrine for nearly the entirety
of the case.
.
Following the surgery, the patient returned to the PACU where he
rapdidly developed respiratory distress, productive cough, and
continued to be hypotensive and hypoxic.  The patient was given
a total of 60mg of lasix, high-flow oxygen, and eventually
placed on bipap.  Consideration was made to intubate, but the
patient began to improve clinically.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient arrived on bipap and was
lethargic, but had stable vital signs but was requiring
pressors; lasix and nitroglycerin gtts were started.
.

CXR [**4-12**]
Right atrial, ventricular, and coronary sinus
pacemaker/defibrillator leads course in expected position.
Following left pleurodesis, the left pleural effusion has
conerted into a moderate left hydropneumothorax.  There is also
new subcutaneous air in the left chest wall. Moderate
interstitial and airspace pulmonary edema have developed, and
moderate cardiomegaly and central venous congestion persist.
Probable small right pleural effusion is present.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate left hydropneumothorax at pleurodesis site.
2.  Increased pulmonary edema.
.
ECHO [**4-13**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. RV with
global free wall hypokinesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CXR [**4-14**]:
There is a dual-lead pacemaker, right IJ central venous line
which are
unchanged in position.  There is also a left-sided chest tube.
No
pneumothoraces are seen.  There is a marked cardiomegaly,
moderate pulmonary edema and a left retrocardiac opacity.  The
opacities of the right base have improved since the prior study.
 No pneumothoraces are present.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o male with a history of afib, heart failure c/b recurrent
transudative pleural effusions presenting with acute respiratory
distress following pleurodesis.

1. Hypoxia s/p VATS pleurodesis: There could have been multiple
etiologies to his decompensation, including procedural fluid
shifts following VATS and CHF exacerbation during and after the
procedure. His BNP was elevated and he had evidence of pulmonary
edema on CXR. The fast progression of symptoms make acute
pulmonary edema the most likely diagnosis. The patient was
stabilized on BiPap, his diuretics were restarted, and he was
quickly weaned off of oxygen. The patient's chest tube was
removed on the floor after the amount of drainage decreased. His
pleural fluid culture and tissue culture was negative. He was
discharged with the pleurex catheter with VNA to help with
intermittent drainage.

2. Hypotension: After the VATS, the patient required transient
norepi for blood pressure support. On the floor, the patient's
SBP remained in the 80s and 90s. This is slightly below recent
baseline, so his home meds and diuretics were carefully
reinitiated. On discharge, the patient's SBP was in the low 100s
and he was asymptomatic.

3. CHF: Restarted on torsemide 40mg. Spironolactone decreased
from 25mg [**Hospital1 **] to Qday. He remained on digoxin. Lisinopril was
held on discharge due to recent hypotension. The patient was
euvolemic on discharge.

4. Afib: The patient was maintained on Sotalol, Digoxin, and
Warfarin. His INR was subtherapeutic on discharge. He will have
this rechecked at home. He will have his pacer interrogated by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the near future.

5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia. After the procedure,
his Hct trended down slightly and he tolerated one unit of
PRBCs. Iron studies were sent that showed a low iron level, but
normal ferritin. The patient's outpatient providers can
determine whether the patient should be supplemented with iron
pills.

TRANSITIONAL:
- INR checks
- Iron Pills?
