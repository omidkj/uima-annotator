CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 66639**]
Reason: eval for pleural effusions
Final Report
HISTORY: Status post CABG. Evaluate pleural effusions.
CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
A right IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC. No
pneumothorax is
detected.
The patient is status post sternotomy. There is mild prominence
of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette, unchanged compared with [**2110-12-16**].
There is a
small left effusion and patchy increased retrocardiac density,
essentially
unchanged. There is minimal pleural thickening along the right
chest wall and blunting of the right costophrenic angle. This is
more apparent on today's exam, but not clearly changed. No CHF.
Probable background hyperinflation.
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged on the
left and
probably unchanged on the right, though thelatter is better seen
on today's examination.
