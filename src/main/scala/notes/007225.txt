IMAGING:
Head CT [**2-6**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large 3.5 x 4.8 cm intra-axial
right frontal lobar hemorrhage, with surrounding edema and
associated mass effect. The midline shift measures approximately
7 mm. Underlying masses possibly present, although this may
represent bland hemorrhage. MRI is recommended for further
evaluation. There are no other foci of intracranial hemorrhage
identified. Aside from mass effect from the hematoma, the
ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are unremarkable in appearance.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is otherwise preserved as
well. There is no evidence for acute large vascular territory
infarction. Visualized bones demonstrate no abnormality.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Large right frontal lobar hemorrhage. MRI is
recommended for
further evaluation to exclude underlying mass lesion.

MRI Head [**2-7**]:
FINDINGS: Again identified is a large right frontal hematoma.
The overall
size of the hematoma appears unchanged since the prior CT scans.
Again
identified is extensive surrounding edema with local mass effect
and mild
right to left midline shift. There are numerous other areas of
deep white
matter hyperintensity in a predominantly periventricular
pattern. Although
this could be a consequence of chronic small vessel ischemia,
the possibility of demyelinating disease should be considered.
After contrast administration, there is a thin rim of
enhancement surrounding the hematoma. In addition, at least one
small vessel is detected coursing
through the center of the hematoma. These findings raise the
possibility of an underlying vascular malformation as the
etiology of the hemorrhage.
Enhancement of the periphery of the hematoma may arise after
several days is a consequence of hemorrhage alone. Thus, the
significance of the enhancement and edema depend on the time
elapsed between the hemorrhage and these images. Early
appearance of enhancement and edema implies an underlying lesion
that could produce both, such as a neoplasm. After several days,
the combination of enhancement and edema may represent reaction
to the hematoma itself, and are thus of little diagnostic
significance. There are no prominent feeding vessels or draining
veins, thus a CT angiogram is unlikely to be helpful. If it is
necessary to pursue the possibility of a vascular malformation,
a catheter arteriogram may be needed.
CONCLUSION: Right frontal hematoma again seen with surrounding
edema and a
thin rim of enhancement. There may be a small vessel coursing
through the
substance of the hematoma.

CT Torso:
POST-CONTRAST CT OF THE CHEST: Imaged thyroid gland appears
unremarkable.
Multiple subcentimeter mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are
identified. The aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
calcifications with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
Pulmonary arteries are grossly unremarkable. The heart is not
enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a somewhat
hypoenhancing lobulated mass in the left posterior mid-lower
hemithorax adjacent to the vertebral body and inseparable from
the medial pleural space and the left hilum measuring
approximately 5.9 x 4.8 cm (3:25). There are adjacent
atelectatic changes as well as interlobular and intralobular
septal thickening. Severe emphysema is noted. There is a 2.4 x
3.2 cm spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (3:22). Linear
opacity in the left upper lobe may represent scarring (3:13).
There is no pneumothorax. Atelectatic changes of the left lower
lobe are noted.
ABDOMINAL CT WITH CONTRAST: The liver contains a 0.9-cm area of
hypoenhancement (3:52). There are also subcentimeter
hypodensities in the
left lobe (3:54-57), incompletely characterized. Gallbladder is
unremarkable. Spleen, pancreas appear unremarkable. Both
adrenals contain large adenomas measuring up to 2.7 cm on the
left and 2.5 cm on the right. Both kidneys are in normal
anatomic location and demonstrate symmetric enhancement. Imaged
bowel is unremarkable. There is no bowel obstruction or bowel
wall thickening. Abdominal aorta and iliac vessels demonstrate
atherosclerotic calcifications with no aneurysmal dilatation.
There is no intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST: Small amount of air within the urinary
bladder is
likely secondary to instrumentation. A Foley catheter is seen in
the urinary bladder. There is moderate amount of urine in the
urinary bladder. Rectosigmoid colon is grossly unremarkable and
contains stool. The uterus
contains multiple fibroids, some of which are calcified and
likely
degenerating. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a probable bone island measuring 4
mm in the
left femoral head (3:113). No lesion to suggest malignancy or
infection is
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Spiculated right upper lobe mass concerning for malignancy.
Hypoenhancing mass in the left mid-lower hemithorax (possibly
necrotic) is pleural-based with adjacent post-obstructive
pneumonia or lymphangitic spread of cancer. Subcentimeter
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. Bilateral adrenal adenomas. Fibroid uterus.
3. Severe emphysema.
