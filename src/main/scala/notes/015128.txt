Admission [**2118-9-19**] CXR:  PA and lateral views of the chest are
obtained. Low lung volumes limit evaluation. There is ill
definition of the left heart border which may be related to
early lingular pneumonia. In addition, there are increased
bronchovascular markings in the right cardiophrenic recess which
is likely related to crowding of bronchial vasculature/low lung
volumes. There is no pleural effusion or evidence of
pneumothorax. Heart size does not appear enlarged. Mediastinal
contour is unremarkable. Osseous structures appear intact.
Possible early pneumonia in the lingula. Somewhat limited study
due to low lung volumes.
.
[**2118-9-20**] CXR There is minimally increased opacity seen projecting
over the left heart margin. This is likely a focus of lingular
consolidation. There is also new opacity projecting over the
right lung base and right costophrenic angle. Given the history,
this may also represent a focus of infection. Otherwise, there
are no new foci of infection. The cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged. The visualized soft tissue structures and bony thorax
are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild interval increase in left
lingular opacity, likely pneumonia. 2. New, right lung base
opacity, may be a second focus of pneumonia.
.
[**2118-9-20**] CT Head with contrast: There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles are normal
in size and configuration. The calvarium and soft tissues are
normal. Following administration of contrast, there are no
abnorma
