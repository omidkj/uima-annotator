CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiac catheterization status post cath
and increased wedge pressure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  66-year-old female with history
of hypertension, nonobstructive cardiomyopathy with diastolic
dysfunction, status post catheterization.  She has had
worsening dyspnea on exertion over two to three months,
increased edema and was referred for catheterization.
Catheterization showed a right dominant system,
non-angiographically apparent lesions in LMCA, LAD, and left
circumflex, 30% RCA, hemodynamic resting with mean RA 15,
C-wedge pressure of 34, diastolic pressure 25, moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension with mean PAP of 46, cardiac
index of 1.6.  Patient then received Nitroprusside with wedge
to 14 and was given milrinone with a wedge of 23 and index of
2 which brought the wedge to 14.  The patient's symptoms, she
has had increased dyspnea on exertion over two to three
months to walking about one block, difficulty walking up a
flight of stairs, has had difficulty with activities as
noted, also with mild lower extremity edema.  She denies any
fevers or chills.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  INR 1.4, PT 14.6.  CBC showed
a white blood count of 4.6, hematocrit of 39.7, platelet 197.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.5, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN
9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 108, calcium 9.4, magnesium 1.9,
phosphorus 3.3.  Echo showed LV mildly dilated, 1+ mitral
regurgitation, ejection fraction of 35-40%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  66-year-old female with history of atrial
fibrillation pacemaker in [**9-/2192**], hypertension, mitral
regurgitation, also nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, presented
with increased shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion,
status post catheterization, now notable for increased
filling pressures which had improved with Nipride and
milrinone.  She is now status post cardiac catheterization, has
30% right coronary artery lesion.  Other coronaries non-
angiographically
significant.  She was continued on her aspirin.  For her pump
the filling pressures improved with Nipride and milrinone and
was continued.  Her home regimen which was Enalapril and
metoprolol and Lasix was also continued.  In terms of her EP,
EP was consulted.  The patient's plan in terms of her pump
was filling pressures improved with Nipride and milrinone
and has been weaned off Nipride and decreased milrinone since
midnight since the admission, so this is day 2 and she was
continued to lower her dose of milrinone drip and plan was to
switch her eventually to her home regimen of Enalapril,
metoprolol and Lasix.  The patient's CVP was 8 to 9 at this
point, day after, and she was negative two liters by this
point.  EP was consulted and plan was to get outpatient
myocardial oxygen ventilation rate and exercise tolerance
test in two to four weeks after discharge with results to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
after the myocardial oxygen ventilation rate.  So the day
before discharge the patient was weaned off the drips by now
and tolerating the Enalapril, Lasix and metoprolol and
losartan which was added on to her regimen.  For the coronary
she was continued with the aspirin, doing well.  In terms of
her EP, she continued with atrial flutter/atrial
fibrillation.  Rate increased to 90 per EP for the pacing
rate and  AVJ ablation in the past.  Continue with heparin
and Coumadin for anticoagulation and for evaluation of
biventricular pacer, she will need outpatient myocardial
oxygen ventilation rate/exercise tolerance test after
discharge in two to four weeks and to continue as discussed
earlier with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and then follow up results with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  On the day of discharge the
patient was doing much better, no acute distress.  All labs
had improved.  She was on her Enalapril, Lasix, metoprolol.
Her losartan was held for then and was to be added as
tolerated and her atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation as
discussed earlier.

PLAN:  To follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition.  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Discharge instructions were to call

chest pain, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness or
dizziness or palpitations.  Also, patient was noted to check
her daily weight.  If increased more than two pounds, please
call PCP about Lasix dose.

up for outpatient myocardial oxygen ventilation rate exercise
tolerance test on [**10-30**] at 11:00 a.m.  This is on the
[**Location (un) 436**] of [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Cardiac Services and she was instructed
to take no food or caffeine one hour before the appointment

Clinic, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3512**].  She also has an appointment in the
device Clinic, follow up appointment to evaluate the pacemaker
rate on the same day as the congestive heart failure clinic
appointment on [**10-31**] at 9:30 a.m.  Also, has an
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in [**Hospital 191**] Clinic on [**12-3**] at 2:00
p.m.
7.  Major surgical invasive procedures, none.
8.  Cardiac catheterization notable for elevated filling
pressures and also coronaries were shown to be 30% right
coronary artery lesion and other vessels without
angiographically apparent lesions.
