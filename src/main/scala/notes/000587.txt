History of Present Illness:
42 y.o. female smoker  with COPD, HTN, sleep apnea, CHF, and
HTN, on home O2, transferred from OSH for "possible open lung
biopsy."  Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on
[**5-26**] with DOE, SaO2 of 67%, low-grade fevers to 100.1, and
palpitations [**1-18**] anxiety after three days of medication
non-compliance.  Patient is not able to give any reason for her
non-compliance.  She denies chest pain, dysuria, lower extremity
swelling or pain, or any rashes.  She does report that she had a
bout of diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea lasting approximately
three weeks which ended suddenly this past Friday.  She has had
a normal formed BM x 1 since then, and denies any abdominal
pain, melana, BRBPR, hemetemesis, or hematochezia.  She saw her
PCP who put her on the BRAT diet but did not recommend any
further work-up.  She denies any recent travel, sick contacts,
or changes in her routine.
.
At the OSH pt became hypoxic on the floor, unable to maintain
her sats even on 100% by NRB so she was transferred to the ICU.
She was started on BiPAP with significant improvement in her
oxygenation and treated with solumedrol 80 mg IV.  She was found
to have a RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA and she was started
on Levaquin.  She had a chest CT with significant new findings
as described below and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
work-up and management.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 42 y.o. woman with [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH for unclear
reasons after presenting with COPD exacerbation in the setting
of medication non-compliance and possible PNA.
.
#Respiratory Distress/COPD: Patient was transferred from the
[**Hospital1 1562**] ICU directly to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The differential was wide.
She is not neutropenic but her chest CT is most consistent with
an infection, especially given the acute onset.  Infectious
etiologies include viral (RSV, parainfluenza, influenza,
adenovirus), bacterial (mycoplasma), and less likely fungal.
Also on the differential are allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis and less common interstitial pneumonias such as
acute eosinophilic pneumonia; however, preliminary CT read by
[**Hospital1 18**] radiologists seemed to indicate an alveolar process.
Studies were sent:  legionella antigen (negative),
mycoplasma titer (pending), IgE level ([**2169**], high), nasal swab
for viral cx (pending), HIV (pending), and DFA for influenza
(negative.)  Patient was unable to produce a specimin for sputum
culture.  She was continued on Levofloxacin for likely atypical
versus viral pneumonia and treated with her usual home
medications including atrovent, singulair, and xopinex, which
was subsequently changed to albuterol without ill effect.  She
was treated with steroids at the OSH, and these were continued,
initially as 80 mg solumedrol Q8H, which was then transitioned
to medrol, and the plan is to do a long, slow medrol taper over
the course of about 1 month.  She remained stable on 100% by
non-rebreather and she was started on BiPap at night, which she
tolerated reasonably well.  This was started to decrease her
work of breathing and because she has known sleep apnea and has
only been waiting for insurance approval before beginning home
BiPap.  Her respiratory status continued to improve with
treatment and patient now has stable oxygen saturations on 4L by
NC. After review of her case at pulmonary conference it was
decided that a biopsy after several weeks on steroids would be
non-diagnostic, therefore the decision was to keep her on a slow
steroid taper and if she recurrs biopsy her at that time. She
will go home on 2 weeks of 48 mg medrol, and taper by 6 mg every
week for a total of 7 more weeks of steroids. She will follow up
with her regular pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 47851**], of [**Hospital 1562**]
hospital, and arrange to have PFTs in [**Month (only) 205**]. She will then follow
up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] here at [**Hospital1 **] [**2170-7-3**] in clinic. If she
develops recurrent disease/symptoms she will likely need a
biopsy at that time.
.
#HTN: Currently normotensive; held cardizem while an inpatient,
and was never hypertensive. Follow up with PCP regarding
restarting this medication.
.
#Elevated blood glucose: Does not currently carry a diagnosis of
diabetes but had some notably high sugars at OSH; HgA1C was 5.7.
 While in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was covered with a regular insulin
sliding scale. She was sent home on a sliding scale regular
insulin. She likely will not need this when she comes off
steroids.
