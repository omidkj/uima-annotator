History of Present Illness:
71M with MMP including CHF, afib, CAD, and COPD and multiple
admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] (recently D/C'd [**2-15**] from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]/MICU for
admission for CHF/chest pain) found at HebReb to have change in
MS and O2 sat 76-80% RA. In [**Name (NI) **], pt initially placed on 3L O2:
91% then dropped to 86%.  ABG initially 7.3/44/66, pt placed on
bipap: 7.24/50/90. Per previous DC summaries, pts base ABG is nl
(no hypercarbia).  She was noted to have thick yellow sputum. At
some pt in ED, BP dropped and ED team unable to find pulse.  LIJ
attempted, but unsuccessful. R groin line placed and pt started
on dopamine and levophed.  Lactate in ED 1.5. UA positive and pt
started on empiric coverage with Vanc, Levo, flagyl. CXR showed
CHF. Cr elevated at 2.9 from baseline 0.8-1.2.

Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2-25**], where she was treated
for her hypotension with pressors and IVF (7 L). She was also
continued on vanc/levo/flagyl for emperic treatment of sepsis
while cultures were pending.  Pt was off pressors on [**2-28**] and
transferred to medical floor.

During medical evaluation pt revealed that she may have had
diarrhea for 2 weeks prior to admission, however, [**Hospital **] rehab
was unable to corroberate since no evidence that pt had diarrhea
there.  During this hospitalization, pt was found to be c.
difficile toxin positive.

CXRAY [**2123-2-27**]- The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but
stable. There is upper zone [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] redistribution, perihilar
haziness, and a bilateral interstitial pattern which has
progressed in the interval compared to the previous study. There
is a small right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 71 yo female with mult medical problems including afib,
chf, CAD, DM who presents from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with resolved
hypotension, and hypoxia.  Now treat for C.diff colitis (most
likely from recent tx with levaquin).

Diarrhea- cdiff +
-po flagyl (continue for six days post discharge)
-IV vanco/flagyl and levaquin d/c'd after transfer to medical
floor
-we did not give IV fluid since she looked overloaded on exam

Hypoxia- was on 4L NC in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] weaned down to 2l on floor.  She
was placed on bipap at night (10,5,3L) in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but refused it on
the medical floor.
-d/c'd levaquin since did not seem to have clinical pneumonia
-given nebulization treatments to help with the her sob/wheezing
with good result
The initial hypoxia that brought her to the hospital was never
revealed, perhaps as a result of refusing bipap although in
house her saturation was okay without bipap at night.
Sepsis is a possibility- perhaps from her picc line that was
placed many months ago
-PICC was d/c'd on this admission

Hypertension- on ace and bb as outpt, held due to hypotension
initially but restarted bb and ace when on medical floor

Afib- was continued on amioderone, beta blocker, coumadin

ARF- Cr now normalized with fluids (baseline .8-1.2)
-we restarted lasix on transfer to medical floor

CHF- noted to have JVD, 1+ pitting edema so lasix was restarted

Leg ulcers- chronic superficial ulcer on right calf, left big
toe, and l heel, +MRSA
-tx'd with vit c/zinc/collagenase
-dressing changes and bactroban
-wound care consult was familiar with pt and recommended
aquacell ag, adaptic on left big toe, dry dressing on L heel
-podiatry cut her toenails since they were causing skin
breakdown

S/p thryoidectomy for thyroid ca
-continued synthroid

Neuro/pain-
-we continued fentanyl patch
-we also continued oxycodone, neurontin (renally dosed), topomax

DM
-was placed on insulin ss, lantus

Code on this admission was DNI, but pt DOES want to be
resuscited.
