HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 45228**] is a 75 year old male
who is admitted after being transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**]
for management of congestive heart failure.

The patient had presented on [**2160-8-6**] to [**Hospital3 6265**] with a several day history of dyspnea, nonproductive
cough, weakness and orthostasis.  A chest x-ray at the
outside facility revealed changes consistent with congestive
heart failure.  The patient was noted to have an oxygen
saturation between 85% and 91% on a 100% nonrebreather.  He
was therefore started on nitroglycerin, morphine and Lasix,
and ultimately transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization as it appeared that he was
ruling in by cardiac enzymes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus with
neuropathy and nephropathy.  2.  Hypertension.  3.  Chronic
renal insufficiency secondary to diabetic nephropathy, with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 1.5.  4.
Hyperlipidemia.  5.  Congestive heart failure with recurrent
exacerbations by history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a stressful relationship
with his son, who uses drugs.  He does live alone but his son
happens to be living with him at the time of transfer.  The
patient has a greater than 20 pack year tobacco history but
quit 30 years ago, and has no significant alcohol or drug
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on transfer,
the patient had a blood pressure of 120/60, heart rate 82,
respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 91% on six liters, 86%
in room air, fingerstick of 111 and temperature 98.3.
General:  The patient was in moderate distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact, pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
oropharynx clear, moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  The patient
did not have jugular venous distention on transfer, as he had
already started his empiric  congestive heart failure
management, no bruits in carotids auscultated.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, distant heart
sounds, normal S1 and S2, S3 gallop present.  Pulmonary:
Diffuse rhonchi with slight crackles at the bases.  Abdomen:
Soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Vascular:
Distal pulses intact bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Some
fasciculations throughout, normal strength bilaterally and
moved all extremities without difficulty, remainder of exam
nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 11.8,
hematocrit 31, platelet count 252,000, BUN 46, creatinine
2.3, up from baseline of 1.5 to 1.6, prothrombin time 13, INR
1.2 and partial thromboplastin time 28.6.  Cardiac enzymes at
the outside hospital were just noted for the troponin-I
peaking at 2.74 with a CPK/MB of 8.7, ultimately ruling him
in for a simple myocardial infarction.  Electrocardiogram on
admission was noted for normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular
hypertrophy and inferior Q waves.  Chest x-ray showed
questionable left lower lobe infiltrate and likely
cephalization.  Echocardiogram showed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 30% to 35% with severe left ventricular
hypertrophy, moderate left atrial enlargement, moderate
aortic and mitral valve thickening, no aortic regurgitation,
no mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation seen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's presentation, he was
admitted to the C-Medicine service.  He was started on a
regimen to prepare him for his cardiac catheterization.

On [**2160-8-11**], the patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization, revealing significant three vessel disease
as well as significant aortic stenosis with a mean gradient
of 22 and an aortic valve area of 1.3.  Given these findings
and his recent myocardial infarction, it was discussed with
the C-Medicine service under Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] that a
cardiothoracic surgical consultation should be obtained.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was evaluated.  He
was deemed an appropriate surgical candidate and, thereafter,
was scheduled for three vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting and likely aortic valve repair with a bovine valve.

On [**2160-8-12**], the patient went to the Operating Room
and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three
with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery.  He also got a 23 mm aortic valve
replacement using a mosaic porcine valve 22 mm, [**Company 1543**]
SN23A6430651.  The patient came off the pump with a mean
arterial pressure of 88, central venous pressure of 13, PAD
pressure of 24.  He was being supported with milrinone,
Levophed and propofol.

Postoperatively, the patient went to the SCRU.  He remained
intubated postoperatively.  By the morning, he was noted to
have a temperature of 101.3, still on IMV with a rate of 14
and tidal volume 700, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 5.  Gas
on that was 7.41, 36, 83, 24.  He was Dopamine 2, propofol 30
and had been started on levofloxacin for his presumed left
lower lobe pneumonia/infiltrate.  He was noted to have
copious secretions.

Ultimately on [**2160-8-14**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7625**] performed a
bronchoscopy on the patient.  The nasopharynx, oropharynx
and larynx were all clear.  His airway was noted to have
thick tenacious secretions in the basal segments,
particularly on the left, particularly having left lower lobe
collapse and mucus plugging.  Additionally at this time, the
patient was transfused a unit of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 26.  He continued on his ventilatory support.
It was difficult to wean the patient given his pneumonia and
significant PEEP and pressure requirement.

Ultimately, the patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit on [**2160-8-15**] after having a
reintubation on [**2160-8-14**] secondary to respiratory
distress.  Therefore, on [**2160-8-15**], he was
transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for
ventilatory support and weaning.

At the time of transfer to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit on [**2160-8-15**], the patient's neurological
examination was noted for pupils equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation, 4 to 3 bilaterally.  He was
following commands, moving all extremities times four, left
greater than right.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  He had
mild pain but was sedated on exam.  Medications at this time
were significant just for vancomycin, which had been
continued postoperatively, Levaquin for the presumed
pneumonia, Dopamine, milrinone, norepinephrine,
nitroglycerin, Nipride, and phenylephrine.  He had a .......
score of three on [**2160-8-15**] as well.

Given the finding of the possible decreased right sided
movement, there was suspicion for a possible infarction.  The
plan was to wean the patient's sedation to establish a
baseline neurologic examination once it was appropriate.
Additionally, his ventilatory support was maintained on SIMV.
He was on tidal volumes of approximately 800 with a rate of
12.  He was on PEEP and pressure support of 10 and 10.  His
gases on that were appropriate except his pAO2 was somewhat
low in the 69 to 81 range.  He was being supported with tube
feeds at this time.  There was noted to be gram negative rods
growing out from the broncho-alveolar lavage sample from
[**2160-8-14**] prior to his reintubation.

By [**2160-8-20**], the patient had a protracted ventilatory
wean.  He was noted to have been off sedation at this point
and, having some questionable focal finding on examination
that was consistent with a possible left sided stroke, he
underwent a CT scan of the head that revealed a subacute
infarction in the left occipital regi
