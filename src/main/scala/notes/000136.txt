HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2149-10-3**], this 33-year-old G6,
P5 underwent a dilatation and evacuation which was
complicated by a uterine perforation and injury to the
sigmoid mesentery.  An intraoperative Surgery consult was
obtained.  The Surgery Team recommended a partial resection
of the denuded bowel.  The patient underwent a
resection and an end-to-end reanastomosis.  The patient also
underwent a repair of the uterine perforation as well as a
tubal ligation.   Intraoperatively, the patient received a
total of four units of packed red blood cells, two units of
FFP and 1500 cc of hetastarch.  Please see the full operative
note for details.

1.  Hematology:  Intraoperatively, the patient's hematocrit
nadired at 14.  As previously stated, the patient received a
total of four units of packed red blood cells and two units
of FFP intraoperatively.  After surgery the patient was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where serial
hematocrits were followed.  The patient's laboratories were
notable for a likely dilutional as well as consumptive
coagulopathy.  On the first night after surgery, the
patient's hematocrit fell to 19.5.  Her platelets were 84,000
and her INR was elevated at 1.5.  On the first postoperative
day, the patient received an additional two units of packed
red blood cells, two units of FFP and four units of
cryoprecipitate.  On postoperative day number two, the
patient received an additional two units of packed red blood
cells so the total products she received were eight units of
packed red blood cells, six units of FFP and four units of
cryoprecipitate.  Her hematocrit stabilized at 29 and her INR
stabilized at 1.1.  The patient's platelets slowly increased
to 128,000 on discharge.  The patient had no further problems
with bleeding during the hospitalization.

2.  Neurology:  The patient was originally intubated and
sedated and was given a morphine drip for pain.  This was
continued through postoperative day number one and the
propofol was weaned on postoperative day number one and she
was extubated later that day.  The patient was started on a
Dilaudid PCA for pain which she used until postoperative day
number five.  The patient was then changed to Percocet and
Motrin which she tolerated well.  The patient was discharged
on Percocet and Motrin.

3.  Pulmonary:  As previously stated, the patient was
intubated until postoperative day number one.  During the
first postoperative day, the patient had wheezing consistent
with an underlying asthma.  The patient was given albuterol
with good response.  The patient was extubated on
postoperative day number one at which time incentive
spirometry was encouraged.  The patient had no further
problems from a pulmonary prospective during the
hospitalization.

4.  Coronary:  The patient was stable from a coronary
prospective throughout the hospitalization.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient initially was NPO with
intravenous fluids and had an nasogastric tube placed.  The
nasogastric tube was removed on postoperative day number one.
The patient was NPO until postoperative day number four.  The
patient began passing flatus at this time and began to take
sips.  The patient tolerated sips without a problem, was
advanced to clears, and by postoperative day number six was
tolerating solids.  The patient was initially on intravenous
Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis which was stopped
on postoperative day number four.  On the evening of
postoperative day number four, the patient complained of
midsternal/epigastric pain.  The patient was restarted on
intravenous Protonix with good relief.  An electrocardiogram
was done at the time which was within normal limits.

6.  Genitourinary:  After the surgery, the patient received
two doses of 1000 mcg of Cytotec per rectum for uterine
atony.  The patient was also started on Methergine .2 mg q. 6
hours times 48 hours.  The patient's bleeding was appropriate
and she did not require any further uterotonics.  The patient
had a Foley catheter until postoperative day number three.
After the catheter was removed she had no difficulties
voiding.

7.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was originally started
on ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin.  She received a
total of 36 hours of these antibiotics.  The patient was
afebrile during the entire hospitalization.  The patient was
started on no further antibiotics.

8.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was on Pneumoboots beginning on
postoperative day number zero.  On postoperative day number
two, the patient complained of some left thigh pain and
swelling.  Although the clinical suspicion was low, the
patient underwent a bilateral lower extremity Dopplers to
rule out deep vein thrombosis and the ultrasound was
negative.  The patient was also on intravenous Protonix for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

9.  Support:  The patient was seen by Social Work during her
admission and was encouraged to contact Dr. [**Name (NI) **] if
she needs any additional support after discharge.

The patient was discharged to home on postoperative day
number six.  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr.
[**Name (NI) **] in one week and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**] from General
Surgery in two weeks.  The patient was discharged to home on
Percocet 5/325, Motrin and Colace.
