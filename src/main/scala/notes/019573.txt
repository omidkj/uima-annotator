History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 84 year old woman with a PMH of HTN, Chronic back and
knee pain (s/p diskectomy), depression and OA found down at home
and brought to the hospital [**8-14**].  According to her son, who
translated for her today, she had a 10 day history of burning
chest, back and shoulder pain.  This pain was not associated
with exertion and was worse with inspiration but not positional.
 It was also associated with SOB and diaphoresis.  She has been
nauseated and vomioted an unknown amount of times.  Pt
attributes this to narcotic regimen which was recently adjusted
by PCP.
.
This am, pt states that around 7:30 am she fell in her bathroom
and was found by a home aid at 10:30am.  She remembers falling
and feeling lightheaded prior to falling.  She is unsure if she
lost consciousness or hit her head.  She denies CP,
palpitations, N/V around the time of the fall.  She also states
that she defecated during this time and denies urination.
.
She was found at [**Hospital1 18**] ED to have an EKG with diffuse ST
elevations in 2,3, AvF, V2-6 and Qs in 2,3,F.  CK was 819, MB 61
and Trop 2.3. She was sent to cath where she was found to have
3VD with LMCA 50%, LAD diffuse dz  60-70% and LCx 90%, RCA 80%
diffuse with mildly elevated filling pressures (PCW 17, RA 10),
LVgram with EF 30%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] intervention was performed.
.
ROS: (Difficult history given son as translator) As above and
DOE, Presyncope, No changes in vision, hearing.  No changes in
bowel or urinary habits.

Pertinent Results:
Data:
Cardiac Cath [**8-14**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with three vessel calcific disease. The LMCA had a distal
tapering 50% lesion. The LAD wsa diffusely diseased and
calcified with serial 70% lesions. it was a lrage vessel that
wrapped aorund the apex and supplied the distal half of the
inferior septum. The LCX had an ostial 90% stenosis. The RCA was
small and diffusely diseased with 80% serial lesions in the
diastal AV groove.
2. Left ventriculography showed apical balooning with akinesis
of
anteroapical and inferoapical wall and EF of 30-40% on Vgram.
3. Hemodynamic assessmnet showed mildly elevated to high normal
left and right sided filling pressures.  CO/CI 4.54/2.62  EF
>55%
.
Echo [**2119-6-9**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no significant
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
minimal pulmonic stenosis

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Chest pain: Patient was admitted and underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**8-14**].  She was found to have three-vessel
disease with LMCA 50%, LAD diffuse dz 60-70% and LCx 90%, RCA
80% diffuse with mildly elevated filling pressures (PCW 17, RA
10), LVgram with EF 30%, 2+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] intervention was performed.
Patient was managed medically, with ASA,
Atorvastatin,Mteoprolol, Plavix, and nitroglycerin as needed.
Metoprolol was later discontinued as it may have been
contributing to the patient's dizziness and Plavix was
discontinued when the patient developed thrombocytopenia.
Plan is for the patient to re-start Plavix as outpatient, once
platelets have recovered.
.
2) Pain. Patient has chronic burning total body pain for which
she was seen by the pain service. which is treated with
oxycontin, gabapentin, and ativan with some relief.  Patient was
transitioned to xanax for discharge.
.
3) Dizziness:  Patient complained of a sensation of dizziness
which may have contributed to her fall at home.  Patient was
seen by neurology an an MRI was obtained, which was normal.  It
seemed that the likely etiology of her dizziness was oxycontin,
which the patient takes to treat her chronic pain.  The dose
which had been increased during this admission was decreased and
changed to more frequent dosing.  Patient was evaluated by PT
and by the RN and she was able to able to ambulate by herself to
a bedside commode without difficulty.  Since her medications
were decreased she has not complained about dizziness and she
will receive physical therapy at rehab.  For safety, she will
remain on fall precautions at rehab.
.
4) Dispo: The patient's son was initially very resistant to the
idea of sending his mother to a rehabilitation/skilled nursing
facility.  He spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who explained that his mother
required more consistent care than the son was able to provide
at home.  Son agreed and patient was discharged to rehab.
