Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Cardizem / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain with respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular drain placed by neurosurgery
Central venous catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
70 y.o. F with a history of CABG x 2 in [**2149**] and [**2158**], s/p DES
to RCA-SVG in [**2160-2-27**], who was admitted to OSH ICU on [**8-5**]
from rehab complaining of shortness of breath with substernal
chest pain radiating to her back for 1 hour. CP was [**7-7**], and
resolved with SL nitro x3. Her EKG at that time was NSR and
unchanged from her baseline. Of note, patient has a history of
MVA trauma in [**2160-6-28**], as a result has multiple fractures
and is trach-vent dependent.
.
Patient was admitted to OSH ICU. She was ruled out for MI with 3
negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed bilateral pulmonary
infilatrates. They were concerned for recurrent aspiration vs.
hospital acquired pneumonia vs. pulm edema. BNP was elevated.
Sputum culture grew MRSA. She was continued on Vancomycin.
Legionella antigen was negative.
.
During hospitalization, the patient was briefly extubated, but
developed recurrent respiratory distress on [**2159-8-20**], and the
ventilator was resumed. BNP 1800. She was diuresed with good
effect. Echo showed EF 35%, 2+ MR, 1+ TR. Her plavix for some
reason was stopped at rehab. It was resumed at OSH on [**8-18**].
Three days prior to admission she was found to have pneumonia at
rehab and was started on Vanc and Zosyn because she grew MRSA
from her sputum. Two days later she developed diarrhea, and was
treated with po Flagyl for presumed C.diff. She was transfused
1u PRBCs on [**8-20**] for HCT of 26.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization. On transfer vitals Tm 98, BPs 130-180/50-70, HR
70-80, 94% on 65% FiO2.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient has some epigastric pain. She
denies chest pain or difficulty breathing. She nods her head yes
to having a frontal headache. She is non verbal and nods/shakes
her head yes/no.

of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
.
[**2160-7-11**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. No mid-cavitary gradient
is identified. No apical intracavitary gradient is present. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal systolic left ventricular systolic function
with small cavity size. Dilated right ventricle. Depressed right
ventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

.
[**2160-7-17**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-7-12**],
the left ventricular function has deteriorated and the right
ventricular pressure and volume overload is more evident (the
anterior wall "dy
