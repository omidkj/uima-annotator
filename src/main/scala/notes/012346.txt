History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 46M with PMH HTN, benzodiazepine/opiate abuse, who
presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was brought in
by EMS from home with report of difficulty breathing x 1 day. Of
note, he presented to the ED in [**9-/2159**] with cough and fever,
and was found to have a RLL pna, and was recommended to be
admitted for IV abx.  However, he refused and left AMA with a Rx
for levoquin 750mg x 2 wks.  He returned to the ED in [**10/2159**],
and chest XR at that time showed severe emphysema and interval
increase in the right basilar opacity, unlikely to be pneumonia.
However, given his symptoms, fever, and prior unresponsiveness
to levofloxacin, ED physicians felt that he should be admitted
with another course of antibiotics. Pt again did not want to be
admitted and was discharged with medications for pain control.
He called his PCP shortly after and was started on "a repeat
course of antibiotics," although which ones are not specified in
PCP's note and are not listed in OMR.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt unable to give history, and
initial sat 75% RA. He was noted to have diffuse rhoncorous
breath sounds and gurgling upper respiratory sounds as well as
pinpoint pupils. Pt was initially awake and talking but not
making sense.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 102.8, 112, 104/56, O2 sats 75%.
EKG showed  EKG: SR@115 peaked Ts Qs V1 V2 (no prior).  He was
intubated immediately for respiratory distress and sedated with
fentanyl and versed.  His ABG after intubation was 7.20/66/366.
There was no prior ABG.  NGT was placed and was noted to have
dark brown guiac positive output.  He was given protonix 80 mg
IV x 1.  CXR was done showing right infrahilar pneumonia, and
per report there was a concern for PCP pneumonia though this is
not documented in the final report.  He was given zosyn,
gentamycin, and azithromycin (ceftriaxone also ordered but
unclear if he got this). He was also given 3L of NS.  Other labs
significant for a K+ of 6.3 (given insulin 10 units, D50,
calcium gluconate), and lactate of 6.7.  He was also noted to
have [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr 2.7 from prior baseline of 0.7), and transaminitis
with ALT/AST 1798/3141.  INR is up to 1.9 from a recent normal
baseline of 1.0.  UA showed small blood, protein of 30, trace
ketones, few bacteria, 4 granular casts, and 64 hyline casts.
Serum tox screen was initially negative in the ED.

On transfer, vent settings were AC, 100% FiO2 PEEP 5, TV:500.
Access - 2 x 20g PIV.
.
On arrival to the ICU, Pt's vitals were  37.2C, HR 96, BP
102/49, RR 16, Sat 99%.

Imaging:

IMPRESSION: 1. Bibasal opacities consistent with multifocal
pneumonia. 2. Complete collapse of the right middle lobe and
segments of the right lower lobe. There is obstruction of the
right middle lobe bronchus as well as the superior and basal
bronchi of the right lower lobe, the etiology of which cannot be
determined on this study. Mucoid impaction is a possibility;
however, other etiologies such as endobronchial neoplasm cannot
be excluded. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left, new since [**2159-10-12**]. 4. Small amount of
ascites seen in the visualized upper abdomen, new since [**10-12**], [**2158**].
