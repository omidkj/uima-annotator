History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 yo male with PMH of adriamycin (Hodgkin's
disease)induced cardiomyotpathy with EF of 15% on metolazone,
torsemide, and aldactone, PAF s/p dual chamber ICD in [**2-11**] after
dofetilide induced torsades, and atrial flutter s/p ablation
[**2190**], who presented to [**Hospital 7927**] Hospital today with a chief
complaint of nausea and epigastric pain.  He notes the pain
started friday night and has had poor PO intake since.  The pain
is mid-epigastric without radiation.  He denies vomitting.  He
has been moving his bowels without any blood in the stool or
dark stool.  Of note, wife notes that he has had increasing
confusion and anxiety over the past day.  At [**Hospital3 **] he was
noted to be hyponatremic to 124, with a baseline in our system
in the low 130s.  He was also noted to be in AOCRF with Cr of
1.8, and baseline over past couple of weeks 1.5-1.6.  Other labs
significant for K+ of 5.6.  He also had altered mental status
and SBPs in the 80s, and in the setting of his hyponatremia and
elevated cr was thought to be in cardiogenic shock.  He was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for milrinone initiation
.
In terms of his heart failure, he has had multiple admissions
over the past several years for acute failure requiring
adjustment of his diuresis regimens.  He recently was instructed
to hold his torsemide on [**11-23**] with a plan to restart at a
lower dose of 40mg daily on [**1-10**] (previously 60mg daily).  He was
told to continue his metolazone 2.5 mg 3x/week, and
spironalactone 25mg daily.  He notes that last week he had an
increase in LE swelling with some SOB, but since restarting his
toresemide yesterday he has had improvment in these symptoms.
His dry weight is 163lb per outpatient records and he is 165 lb
today.
.
Of note, he had a recent admission at the end of [**12/2195**] for leg
erythema thought to be due to erythromelalgia for which he was
started on a full dose aspirin.
.
Vitals on admission were: T: 98  BP: 90/55  HR: 76 (v paced) O2:
99% RA.  Pt noted to be A/O x3 but struggling to give a coherent
history and appearing frustrated/anxious
.
On review of systems, he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. He notes headaches
about 1x/week.  He also notes a decreased desiire to eat.  He
denies changes in bowel habits, difficulty or pain with
urination.  He has baseline swelling and dusky color of his
feet. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, syncope or presyncope

STUDIES:
EKG [**2196-1-12**]: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats and
ventricular premature beats. Intraventricular conduction delay
of left bundle-branch block type. Consider inferior myocardial
infarction. Since the previous tracing of [**2195-11-19**] atrial pacing
is now not apparent and there are now premature beats.

CXR [**2196-1-13**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2195-11-18**]:
Lung apices are excluded from the examination. The other pleural
surfaces and the imaged portions of the lungs are normal. A
right PIC line passes as far as the upper SVC, where it is
obscured by a transvenous pacer defibrillator lead going to the
right ventricle and a pacer lead going to the right atrium.
Heart size is normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo male with chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy, EF 15%
presenting from OSH with hypotension, altered mental status,
AOCRF, and hyponatremia for initiation of milrinone drip.
.
# Adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy with EF 15% and low-flow
state:   He has had multiple admissions over the past few years
for diuresis and on admission was on a home diuresis regimen of
torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **], metolazone 2.5 mg 3x/week, and
spironolactone 25 mg daily.  At [**Hospital3 **], concern was for
cardiogenic shock given hypotension, AMS, hyponatremia, and
AOCRF, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for initiation of milrinone
infusion. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he continued to be mentating
poorly with BPs ranging 70s-90s concerning for a low flow state,
however this improved throughout admission with milrinone and
supplemental neosynephrine, as well as a lasix ggt.  However, pt
was significantly agitated and anxious over the course of
admission and on [**1-13**] se
