Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4393**]
Chief Complaint:
Lab abnormalities/direct transfer from clinic


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49552**] is a 52 year-old man with a history of HIV ([**4-18**] VL
undetectable, CD4 266, toxo seronegative in [**Month (only) 958**]) and HCV
cirrhosis (no varices, MELD 13 in [**6-17**]) who presented from
clinic in setting of further work-up of recent diagnosis of
brain masses.
.
The patient had visited several specialists. He had two LPs with
negative PCR in the recent month for diagnosis of his white
matter lesions in the CNS. This work-up was being done in the
setting of a liver transplant evaluation. Therfore, the brain
mass evaluation was of secondary importance relating to his
potential exclusion from liver transplant. Given these negative
lesions, brain biopsy was being considered as the next
diagnostic option.
.
At baseline, he stated his abdomen had been protuberant for
quite some time with some increasing peripheral edema. He had
not had issues since his last hospitalization in [**Month (only) 116**] with AMS
and is compliant with medications. He does endorse decreased
strength.
.
On the floor, patient was stable, AAOx3, and eating dinner.
.

[**8-18**]: CT head w/o contrast: Acute right temporoparietal

white matter irregularity. Mass effect upon the right lateral
ventricle but no herniation or midline shift. No
intraventricular extension to this hemorrhage.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2136-8-24**]):
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 53-year-old male w/ HIV ([**8-/2136**] VL undectable, CD4 226,
toxo seronegative in [**Month (only) 958**]), HCV cirrhosis c/b ascites and
recent diagnosis of brain masses that was a direct admission
from clinic for evaluation of masses.

# Post MICU course: On [**2136-9-14**], he was transferred back to the
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service.  On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 26179**], he had persistent
left sided paralysis from his ICH.  He was responsive to voice
and touch, but waxed and waned.  He had become incoherent in
speech.  His liver disease worsened and the combination of his
ESLD, HIV complicated by PML, and ICH left his prognosis as very
poor.  Ethics, Palliative Care, and Social Work were all
involved and worked closely with the family on goals of care.
Through the weekend he was tenuous but stable.  On Tuesday [**9-18**]
he was made CMO.  On [**9-20**] his foley was taken out in an effort
to make him comfortable. Urine in the bag was clear and yellow.
Upon removing the foley, he began to bleed.  The bleeding was
stabilized by replacing the foley.  His blood pressure and HR
remained stable throughout the episode of bleeding.  On [**9-21**], at
3:58pm, he expired peacefully with his brother at his bedside.


# Brain masses/Intracranial Hemorrhage
The patient was admitted for further work-up of his brain mass
