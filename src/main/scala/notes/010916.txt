EKG showed atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and
ST depressions in V3 to V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Non ST elevation myocardial infarction.  Patient was
admitted to the Cardiology Service and was found to have
ruled in for a non ST elevation myocardial infarction with
positive CK MB index and Troponin along with EKG changes in
the anterolateral leads.  He was placed on Heparin, Aspirin,
Plavix, Beta-blocker and Nystatin and underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease with a distally occluded left main coronary
artery.  The LAD was grafted in its mid portion and was
filled by both a small atretic LIMA and an SVG.  The left
circumflex was retrograde filled by two SVGs to the OM 1 and
OM 2.  The right coronary artery was the dominant vessel that
was diffusely diseased in the proximal to mid portion and
then occluded in the mid vessel after a moderately sized
acute marginal vessel.  It was also filled distally via SVGs
to the PL and RPDA branches.  Graft angiography revealed the
newer SVG to OM 1 to have a severe anastomotic stenosis.  The
SVG to OM 2 is widely patent to a very small OM.  The SVG to
LAD was widely patent and touched down at the site of a
bifurcating diagonal branch.  The SVG to PL had diffuse
disease throughout with an aneurysmal segment seen distally.
The SVG to RPDA was widely patent with moderate diffuse
disease in the native PDA.  There was a small and atretic
LIMA to distal LAD.  The patient's culprit lesion was felt to
be the SVG to OM 1 anastomotic stenosis.  This lesion was
stented with a drug eluding stent. Resting hemodynamics
revealed markedly elevated right and left sided filling
pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 15, an RVEDP
of 15, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 35 and LVEDP
of 25 and a pulmonary artery pressure of 55/32.  The cardiac
index was depressed at 1.6.  The patient was transferred back
to the Cardiology floor after his cardiac catheterization
where he remained chest pain free.  The patient will remain
on Aspirin and Plavix for life, he will also be discharged on
Statin beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy.

2.  Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
admitted with a new rhythm.  He was found to be in atrial
flutter with rapid ventricular response and was monitored on
Telemetry and was noted to alternate between atrial
fibrillation and atrial flutter.  He underwent a
transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate for thrombus prior
to a planned cardioversion.  The echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 20 to 25 percent with dilated left and
right ventricles and severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.  The patient was noted to have 3+ mitral
regurgitation and 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.  There was no
definite left atrial appendage thrombus seen.  The patient
was seen by electrophysiology service and underwent a
successful atrial flutter ablation.  He was started on
Amiodarone with a loading dose of 400 mg three times a day
for one week and then 400 mg twice a day for an additional
week followed by one month of 400 mg a day, followed by his
maintenance dose of 200 mg a day.  The patient was also kept
on a Heparin drip while Coumadin therapy was initiated.  He
was discharged with a therapeutic INR and should have at
least four additional weeks of Coumadin therapy with an INR
goal of two to three.  Patient should be seen in follow up
and may need an outpatient cardiac monitor to evaluate for
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or recurrent flutter which
would require sustained anticoagulation therapy.  The patient
was unable to be set up to be followed at the [**Hospital 197**] clinic
as they were not accepting new patients.  The patient's
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the
patient will follow up at his office on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**3-25**], to
have his INR checked as his Coumadin dose may need to be
adjusted.

3.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient was found to be in
clinical congestive heart failure on admission.  This was
initially felt to be secondary to his non ST elevation
myocardial infarction as well as to his atrial flutter with
rapid ventricular response in the setting of an ejection
fraction of 20 to 25 percent.  His beta-blockers were
initially held and he was placed on Captopril for after load
reduction and for ease of titration.  He was diuresed with
intravenous Lasix.  However, he experienced peri-procedure
hypotension around the time of his TEE and atrial flutter
ablation and he was transferred to the CCU.  In the CCU the
patient was initially on a Neo-Synephrine drip as he was
suspected to have urosepsis, however, he was quickly weaned
off of the Neo-Synephrine and most likely had hypotension
secondary to severe congestive heart failure and decreased
cardiac output.  He responded well to increased after load
reduction and to diuresis with Lasix.  His congestive heart
failure treatment in the Coronary Care Unit was complicated
