REPEAT BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

HISTORY:
We returned to evaluate this [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with known severe
AS/AR referred on [**2149-6-26**] for a cath and pre-op eval for AVR. Pt
is s/p AVR off pump c/b V tach, shocked x 2 on [**6-26**], extubated
[**6-27**]. Pt was started on clear liquids but had overt coughing
after thin liquids. It appears he was tolerating nectar thick
liquids and pureed solids, but we were consulted to evaluate for
oral and pharyngeal dysphagia while the pt was in the ICU.

PMH includes CHF, CRI, urinary incontinence, anemia, depression,
s/p left nephrectomy [**2136**], L shoulder surgery, tonsillectomy

He was seen on [**2149-7-1**] but had overt signs of aspiration after
ice chips, thin liquids and nectar thick liquids. He had a weak
cough and also had difficulty fully clearing his secretions. It
was recommended he remain NPO and an NG tube was placed. He was
transferred to the floor and a repeat bedside swallowing
evaluation was performed on [**2149-7-3**]. The pt continued to have
intermittent signs of aspiration at the bedside, but it appeared
that he may be able to tolerate a modified diet with
compensatory
strategies, so further evaluation via a video swallowing
evaluation was recommended. A video swallowing evaluation was
performed the same day and findings revealed a mild oral and
pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced oral control, mild
swallow delay, reduced laryngeal elevation / absent epiglottic
deflection and reduced bolus propulsion. It was recommended that
the pt receive primary nutrition via the NG tube and receive
trials of nectar thick liquid and puree consistency solids with
1:1 supervision, alternate between bites and sips, and take
repeat swallows after each bite or sip. The pt was seen for
swallowing therapy on [**2149-7-4**] and tolerated the consistencies
presented and understood the compensatory strategies.

We returned today to evaluate the pt's use of compensatory
strategies, to see if he is tolerating his diet, and to see if
he
could be advanced to a less restricted diet. His RN reported
that
he has been eating well and has not shown overt signs of
aspiration with nectar thick liquids and puree consistency
solids.

EVALUATION:
The examination was performed while the patient was seated
upright in the chair on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 220.

Cognition, language, speech, voice:
The pt was awake, oriented x3 and able to follow all basic
commands. His language was fluent, his speech was not dysarthric
and his vocal quality was WFL with mildly reduced volume.

Teeth: Remaining in fair condition.

Secretions: WFL

ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
The pt presented with symmetrical facial appearance and adequate
labial and buccal tone. Tongue protrusion was at midline and
both
strength and ROM were within normal limits. Palatal elevation
was
symmetrical, +gag.

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
The evaluation was performed with the pt's breakfast tray and
included ice chips, thin liquid (tsp, cup), nectar thick liquid
(cup), puree ([**3-8**] oz) and cracker. Oral transit was timely and
no
residue remained in the oral cavity. Laryngeal elevation was
timely but mildly reduced to palpation. The pt coughed
immediately after 3 trials of thin liquid by cup and consecutive
bites of pudding by tsp (resulting in greater residue). There
were no other overt signs of aspiration for any other
consistencies, including other puree boluses presented.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
The pt showed overt signs of aspiration after half of trials of
thin liquid by cup and all trials of pudding consistency by tsp.
There were no other overt signs of aspiration for any other
consistencies, including other puree consistency boluses. The pt
demonstrated the compensatory strategies and was able to
alternate between bites of solids and sips of liquid with verbal
cues. Therefore, we recommend that the pt continue to take a
modified diet of nectar thick liquids and can be advanced to
soft
consistency solids with 1:1 supervision for help with feeding
and
cues for strategies. Pills can be crushed in puree. If the pt
has
any difficulty tolerating this diet, please re-consult and we
will return to re-evaluate the pt.

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 3, moderate dysphagia with
supervision, strategies and 2 or more diet consistencies
restricted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The pt can continue with a modified diet of nectar thick
liquids and be advanced to soft consistency solids with the
following precautions:

a) 1:1 supervision
b) Single sips of nectar thick liquids only by cup
c) Alternate between EVERY bite and sip.
d) Cue the pt to take an extra swallow after each sip of liquid.

2. Pills can be crushed with puree.

3. Please re-consult if the pt has any difficulty tolerating
this
diet.

4. Follow up with speech and language therapy is recommended for
the pt at rehab.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and
medical team.

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2149-7-6**] 9:38 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with severe AS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
HISTORY: Aortic stenosis.

PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate the patient
to be status post median sternotomy. Cardiomediastinal contours
are [**Age over 90 1506**] compared to [**2149-7-4**]. There has been marked
interval improvement in the previously seen bilateral pleural
effusions. There may be a persistent small left-sided pleural
effusion. Trachea is midline. Surgical clips project over the
left upper quadrant. No consolidation. There is bibasilar
atelectasis. A prosthetic aortic valve is again noted.

IMPRESSION:

Improved bilateral pleural effusions with persistent, small,
left-sided effusion.

Bibasilar atelectasis.
