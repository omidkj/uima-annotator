History of Present Illness:
Pt is 74 yo m w/ COPD, DM, h/o prostate CA, who presented to the
ED after having decreased responsiveness at his nursing homee.
Pt had FS to 300's, received insulin, and FS decreased to 180's
after EMS arrived.  Pt reportedly admitted to SOB x several
weeks, but denies CP.  No N/V/F/C.  Denies hematemesis or bloody
stools.  Pt had increasing edema over past several weeks, and
Lasix was recently increased from 40mg qd to 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have hct of 14.8 and melena on rectal
exam.  NGL was negative. He had a troponin of 0.12 and EKG
changes.  He reportedly was alert in the ED, but then on arrival
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] became less responsive and had periods of apnea. He
was placed on PSV 6/6 and his respiratory status stabiliezed.
He became slightly more responsive and did not tolerate BiPAP
mask.

EGD: Impression: Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus
Erosion in the fundus, stomach body and antrum compatible with
NG trauma
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Colonscopy: Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon,
descending colon and ascending colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of
aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8
cm2) The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old man with COPD, DM 2, HTN, admitted
for unresponsivenes, found to have profound anemia of 14.8, with
report of dark tarry stool in ED. He was initially intubated for
colonoscopy/EGD, and could not be extubated afterward. His brief
ICU course, by problem:
.
#) Anemia: Baseline hct in high 30's, 14.8 on admission.
EGD/colonoscopy unrevealing.  Per GI, capsule likely not
indicated, patient's behavioral issues may prevent him from
cooperating with capsule study requirements. No evidence of
active GI bleed or ischemia, thus lower threshold for
transfusion.
.
#) Respiratory failure: Initially failed extubation secondary to
presumed VAP. On [**11-18**], he began to have thick green secretions
and RR > 30 with fever to 101.8; concern for VAP, placed on
vancomycin and cefepime.  Chest xray showed evidence of
CHF/volume overload.  ECHO showed MR, AS, diastolic
failure--likely all contributing as well. Currently growing GNR
in sputum for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
.
#) Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Baseline hct in high 30's, 14.8 on
admission. Per GI, capsule likely not indicated, patient's
behavioral issues may prevent him from cooperating with capsule
study requirements. No evidence of active GI bleed or ischemia,
thus lower threshold for transfusion.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. Multiple possible etiologies
considered, including HIT (HIT antibodies negative), drug
effect. Platelets 179 on [**11-22**].
.
#) NSTEMI: most likely due to demand ischemia in setting of
profound anemia. Pt has HTN, and now evidence of moderate AS on
TTE.  Cardiology aware and recommended transfusing to Hct > 30;
will consider BB once hemodynamically stable.
- Restart ASA and heparin in setting of GIB
- Attempt re-start low-dose beta-blocker today
- continue statin
.
#) Mental status change:  Pt currently intubated and sedated.
Mental status changes likely multifactorial in setting of
anemia, NSTEMI, OSA, hyperglycemia, and hypercarbia in patient
with underlying dementia and schizoaffective d/o.  Per
healthcare proxy, at baseline patient usually more quiet and
less agitated/ aggressive, but has periods of
agitation/aggression. Resolved over several days post discharge
from the ICU.
.
#) DM 2: pt on insulin 70/30 [**Hospital1 **] at rehab, here was on [**12-27**] dose
until [**11-21**] when 2 more units AM and PM were added. Glucose not
tightly managed, but given possibility of extubation (and
holding tube feeds), will not start long-acting insulin until
after extubation
- Continue to titrate up by 2 units (18units qAM, 17units qPM)
- HISS
.
#) Comm: with [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 56955**]). Sister [**Name (NI) 382**], [**Name (NI) 56926**]
[**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70406**]); guardian ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 70407**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70408**])
- Per report sister will be in town tomorrow; expect code
discussion surrounding extubation

#) Access: left subclavian central line.  Difficult to gain
access.

#) Code: DNR/DNI (per form faxed from NH)
