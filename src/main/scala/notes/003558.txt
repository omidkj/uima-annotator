History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 84458**] is a very nice 53-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis
and end-stage liver failure who presented after a recent
admission with weakness, abdominal pain, and malnutrition.

Patient was recently admitted [**6-16**] to [**6-20**] with fever of unclear
etiology, abdominal pain, all infectious work-up was negative
and patient was stable off broad spectrum antibiotics for >48
hours before D/C. Upon returning home, patient had continuous
bilateral epigastric pain, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] in severity,
associated with nausea and one episode of vomiting on the day
prior to admission. She took once baby dose of ibuprofen, which
helped. Patient had been unable to eat due to nausea, early
satiety and poor appetite. She has felt weak, using walker to
ambulate, and barely able to get out of bed for 4 days. This AM,
she felt lightheaded. She had "whooshing" sounds in her ears.
She presented to appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who was concerned about
her malnutrition and deconditioning.
.
Since admission she was noted to have one positive blood culture
[**6-26**] with coagulase negative staph. With no further positive
cultures, this was presumed to be a a contaminant. She was
treated Vancomycin / Metronidazole / Ceftriaxone on and off from
[**6-26**] - [**6-30**]. Over the next several days care focused on diuresis
with Lasix, nutritional support and pain control. On the day of
transfer to the MICU, patient became nauseated and vomited
approximately 800cc of BRB. Upon arrival the MICU she complains
of nausea and pain.
.
No fevers, +chills. No localized weakness/numbness/tingling. No
headaches/visual changes. No blood in stool or urine. No
dysuria. No cough, SOB.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84458**] is a 53 year-old transplant candidate with a history
of hepatitis C cirrhosis, possible HCC, portal hypertension s/p
variceal banding who presents with deconditioning/malnutrition
and abdominal pain.

# ESOPHAGEAL VARICES:  Ms. [**Known lastname 84458**] had an episode of massive
hematemesis on [**7-7**] in the setting of bleeding esophageal
varices.  She went immediately to the ICU were she was scoped
and banded.  She had a repeat EGD the following AM with more
banding.  Ms. [**Known lastname 84458**] was intubated for airway protection and
eventually stopped bleeding.  She went for surveillence EGD on
[**7-20**] and an additional band was placed.  Ms. [**Known lastname 84458**] was
maintained on nadolol, PPI, and sucralfate.  When she was
received in the ICU on [**2170-7-27**], the patient was noted to have
bleeding from the oropharynx.  Liver service scoped the patient
and was unable to stop bleeding.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was placed.  The
following morning, on [**2170-7-28**], the patient underwent a TIPS
procedure, with a drop in gradient pressure from 13 to 5.
However, blood flow to the varices was not noted to decrease
post procedure.  A paracentesis was also perfored by IR, with 4L
of bloody ascites removed. Albumin was provided to protect
against hepatorenal syndrome.  Multiple units of pRBCs,
platelets, and FFP were given during procedure.  LFTs, ammonia,
CBC, fibrinogen were followed closely.  The esophageal balloon
was deflated before 24 hours, with a small amount of blood
expressed into the aspiration port upon deflation. Patient was
transfused in the ensuing days to keep Hct, INR, fibrinogen, and
platelets at acceptable levels.  The gastric balloon was also
deflated eventually, while the [**Last Name (un) **] was left in place.  The
[**Last Name (un) **] was removed by hepatology on [**2170-7-30**], after the
patient showed minimal bleeding from oropharnyx and ports.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS- Patient arrived to the ICU with
significant altered mental status.  Wide differential including
hepatic encephalopathy, primary CNS, morphine, fluid shits from
pericentesis and transfusions, worsening uremia, infection,
among other causes.  Most likely from worsening hepatic
encephalopathy perhaps coupled with primary CNS etiology given
CT findings, perhaps complicated by fluid shifts after
paracentesis and transfusions.  Patient was unable to receive
treatment for possible hepatic encephalopathy during treatment
for esophageal bleed.  Once off propofol, altered mental status
remained.  Patient remained unresponsive, with increased
sluggishness of pupils.  A CT of the head was performed on
[**2170-7-30**] initially was read as no acute process but showed
evidence of cerebral edema on final read.  With progressive
brain edema and poor mental status, a family meeting was held
and decision was made to withdraw care once all family was
present.  Patient was then terminally  extubated.

# HEPATITIS C CIRRHOSIS: Ms. [**Known lastname 84458**] has HCV cirrhosis and
possible HCC. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose.
Lasix and spironolactone were initially held for hyponatremia
and restarted when the sodium levels came up.  The patient
arrived to the ICU with significant altered mental status,
presumably from hepatic encephalopathy.  Esophageal varices
treated as above.  Ascites removed after TAPs procedure and
again on [**2170-7-30**] with the help of IR.  Both showed hemmorhagic
ascites.  Lactulose and rifaximin were help while the [**Last Name (un) **]
was in place and the patient was being treated for esophageal
bleeding.  The patient was on propofol while on mechanical
ventilation, which was decreased on [**2170-7-29**] to asses changes
in encephalopathy.  Even off sedation, the patient was
significantly altered and unresponsive.  Patient was given
albumin daily to protect from hepatorenal syndrome.  Once the
[**Last Name (un) **] was removed, an OG was placed on [**2170-7-30**].  Patient
was seen and followed by transplant surgery and was awaiting
possible transplant throughout course.
.

# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient was intubated on [**2170-7-27**] and
most likely aspirated blood during that procedure.  CXRs showed
bilateral pleural effusions and worsening physical exam.
Patient also had increasing WBCs.  Patient was on antibiotic
converage for UTI that covered organisms for presumed aspiration
pneumonia.  Patient remained intubated until she expired.
