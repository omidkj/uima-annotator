Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Blurry vision

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 39 year old male with a history of hypertension (on
beta blockade, lasix, hydralazine, imdur, metolazone)
complicated by chronic kidney disease (stage IV), EF of 25-30%,
obesity, and
tobacco abuse.  He presented today to the emergency room after
[**Hospital 2081**] clinic noted severe bilateral papilledema; opthomology
suggested this was secondary to either elevated intracranial
pressure in the setting of malignant hypertension or pseudotumor
cerebri.  He has been symptomatic with blurry vision over the
past month in the absence of headaches or other central
symptoms.  He has noted some gait instability. In the ED, his
blood pressure was noted to be 180/118.  He took his usual dose
of one of his blood pressure meds (unknown) and his BP improved
to 160 systolic.  He was transferred to the MICU for management
of hypertensive emergency.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension, hypertensive chronic kidney disease stage IV,
systolic heart failure, last ejection fraction from [**Hospital 2082**] between 25 and 30%, obesity, and tobacco abuse.


Social History:
The patient continues to smoke cigarettes about ten per day.  He
has cut down recently on the amount that he smokes, but still is
precontemplative about quitting at this time.


Family History:
No history of hypertension, heart disease, or cancer.

IMAGING:

CT Head w/o contrast [**2159-4-6**]:
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Bilateral proptosis.

renal u/s [**2159-4-9**]:
Both kidneys show increased echogenicity consistent with chronic

kidney disease. Two simple cysts in the right kidney, one at the
upper pole and one at the lower pole. Doppler evaluation of both
renal arteries and of the arcuate/segmental vessels in the renal
parenchyma was within normal limits. No ultrasound/Doppler
evidence for renal artery stenosis.

tte [**2159-4-10**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypertensive Emergency:  Pt presented with HTN systolics >200
and blurry vision, found to have papilledema. The patient's
blood pressure was markedly elevated with systolic blood
pressures ranging from 160-210 during ICU stay.  Review of prior
notes outlines a longstanding history of poorly controlled blood
pressures.  His home isosorbide and carvedilol were
discontinued. Labetalol was uptitrated to 200mg TID, Hydral
downtitrated to 50mg TID, clonidine 0.3mg weekly patch started,
and furosemide/metolazone continued as is. MAP >120 was goal. On
leaving the ICU SPB was in 130s. TSH was within normal limits.
It was felt that this patient needed a full workup for secondary
causes of hypertension. In the meantime renal artery ultrasound
done here showed no renal artery stenosis but did show chornic
bilateral changes consistent with CKDD. He should likely have a
workup for hyperaldosteronism (see hypokalemia below) and workup
including urine metanephrines and dexamethasone suppression
test, as he is quite young for this degree of hypertension and
seems to be compliant with his medications. He was initially
started on spironolactone given report of EF 25-30% and thought
that it may help with hypokalemia, however after 3 days (3
doses) this was discontinued so that pt could ideally have a
renin/aldosterone level drawn prior to discharge (which is now
pending), several days after discontinuation. Would recommend
restarting this medication after the appropriate studies have
been done. It is more than likely this patient has sleep apnea
as well; in the ICU he was noted to have desats during sleep
with very loud snoring. Desats resolved instantly on waking. Pt
is also smoking and quite obese both of which are likely
worsening his hypertension. Would recommend outpatient sleep
study as well.
.
#hypokalemia - pt was noted to be hypokalemic with potassium
2.9-3.2. Concern for hyperaldosterone state given concommittant
resistant hypertension. Pt required >160meq potassium repletion
per day while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and still remained with K below 4.0.
Outpatient records demonstrate history of low potassium. Pt also
had been started on spironolactone, and while it was low dose,
it did not appear to help with potassium retention. This was
also unusual in the setting of elevated creatinine/chronic renal
failure, which emphasized concerns for hyperaldosterone state.
Spironolactone was DCd temporarily so that he could have
renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] levels drawn.

#Intracranial hypertension: Likely secondary to systmemic
hypertension.  Neurology evalauted patient in ED and sugge
