Chief Complaint:
CC:  SOB/cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year-old female with hx of COPD on home oxygen,
asthma, dCHF, diabetes, and remote history of colon cancer who
presented to the ED with several days of worsening cough and
dsypnea.

The patient states she last felt completely well two weeks ago.
Two days ago she began to have increasing cough, productive of
mucous.  Denies blood in the mucous.  No fevers, but does admit
to some chills at night.  Does admit to left-sided rib pain with
coughing, but no other chest pain.  In terms of her COPD
history, she has never required intubation and hasn't received
steroids recently.  She is on [**3-15**] L of oxygen at baseline.  She
did not have a flu shot this year.  She did have one last year
and a pneumovax last year.

EMS was called and found her to be satting at 94% on NRB with
coarse wheezing throughout her lung fields.  She was given 2
albuterol nebs on her way to the ED.

In the ED, inital VS: T 100.5 HR 116  BP 133/86  RR 28  Sat 92%
on a NRB.  CXR was unremakrable.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
On exam she had increased work of breathing.  She was placed on
a continuous neb x 1 hour, but when she was tried to be spaced
out to combivent nebs/nasal cannula her oxygen sats dropped to
the low 80's (82% on 5L NC) so she was placed back on a NRB.
She was also given levofloxacin 750 mg IV, 2 gm IV magnesium,
and 125 mg IV methyprednisolone.  She also got 1 L NS.  Per
report her lung exam/tachypnea did improve with the nebs given
in the ED.

Currently she states her breathing is much improved from when
she arrived in the ED.  She still feels slightly short of breath
at rest now.

On review of systems she denies abdominal pain, vomiting,
diarrhea, new myalgias or arthralgias.  She does admit to a HA
and slight nausea previously.

Imaging:
CXR: Mild hyperinflation.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No
change from previous CXR.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2153-4-9**], no major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
TO FOLLOW UP:
- prednisone taper
- titration of insulin as prednisone weaned off

Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo female with COPD on home oxygen, asthma,
dCHF, and DM II who was admitted with cough, dsypnea, and
persistent hypoxia consistent with a COPD exacerbation. She was
difficult to wean from BIPAP and stayed in the MICU for 7 days
while her respiratory function slowly recovered. PNA felt less
likely to be contributing, but treated with 5 day course of
levofloxacin.  Additionally, has diastolic failure and was
diursed in a effort to improve her respiratory status.

#  COPD Flare: Patient is oxygen dependent (2-4L) at baseline,
but was persistently hypoxic to the low 80's in the ED on
increased oxygen support even after several neb treatments and
she was admitted to the MICU on BIPAP.  She did not require
intubation. Atypical or early PNA felt to be possible and she
was treated with 5d of levofloxacin.  COPD treated with high
dose steroids, tapered to 50mg on discharge, tiotroprium,
albuterol nebs, monteleukast, spiriva and fluticasone inh [**Hospital1 **].
She was in the MICU for 7 days with difficulty weaning from
BIPAP but called out to floor on HD 7.  Legionella negative. She
will need her prednisone to be tapered at rehab as she improves.
Would do slow taper given significant COPD.

#  Nausea/vomiting:  The day the patient was called out to the
MICU, she developed nausea/vomiting overnight on [**2-19**] and had an
elevated white count to the 20's on am labs.  This resolved with
bowel movements and WBC count felt to be [**3-13**] steroids and they
trended down to 16 on day of discharge.  C. diff was not sent
and she was not treated with antibiotics.

#  Hyponatremia:  Na of 132 in the ED.  Likely slightly dry on
admission. Resolved with IVFs.  Likely secondary to hypovolemic
hyponatremia.

#  Diabetes Type II: Patient on metformin and glipizide as an
outpatient. These were held while she was acutely ill.  Sugars
were high on the sliding scale so lantus qam was added and her
sliding scale was uptitrated, it is attached to this summary.
As she weans off steroids, will likely need insulin titrated.

#  Chronic dCHF/hypertension:  Patient has an EF >55% on her
last TTE in [**12-17**].  Normal BNP in the ED and no evidence of
volume overload on exam or CXR.  Mostly normotensive.  She was
continued on diltiazem and lisinopril was added back as her
blood pressure have been stable.  TTE reordered due to concern
that her respiratory issues may be paritally cardiac which
showed no change (EF > 55%).  Hctz was added back on [**2-19*
