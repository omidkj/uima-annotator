Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for management of hyperglycemia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2158-8-30**]: PICC placement.


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 65193**] is a 65 yo F with history of CAD, dCHF, HTN, HL, DM
II, CKD, ILD, COPD and OSA (on CPAP) who was transfered from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for management of hyperglycemia. Patient was
admitted to OSH on [**2158-8-21**] with headache and "upset stomach". OSH
head CT was normal. In the OSH ED she developed L sided SSCP;
EKG revealed ST depressions in the lateral leads and TWI in the
inferior leads. Given her complicated CAD history she was
admitted and treated for ACS. She subsequently ruled out for MI
and underwent a phamacological stress test with nuclear imaging
that revealed small reversible defect of the inferior apical
wall and a TTE that showed EF 55-60% and mild-moderate AS.

Her course was complicated by dificult to control hyperglycemia
(BG up to 800s) requiring 80 [**Location 16422**]500 TID, 20 units of novolog
with meals and prn IV insulin to maintain BG in 300-400 range.
She was tranfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her hyperglycemia.

Imaging:

[**2158-8-29**] CXR (portable): There is a retrocardiac opacity, that
could reflect pneumonia and/or atelectasis. There is also a
faint opacity in the right upper lobe could reflect another
focus of developing infection or atelectasis. There is mild
vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema, sizeable
pleural effusion, pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low, causing
exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is
relative prominence of the right hilum and could be related to
vascular engorgement.

[**2158-8-30**] CXR (portable): Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
Linear opacity in left mid lung region is consistent with
atelectasis, and small amount of pleural fluid persists in the
right minor fissure. No new areas of consolidation to suggest
the presence of pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 65 year old female with multiple medical problems who
was transferred from [**Name (NI) 1474**] Hospital for management of
hyperglycemia.  While at [**Hospital1 1474**] she had a pharmacologic stress
test showing a small inferoapical reversible defect; TTE showed
EF 55-60% and mild-moderate AS.  Glucose was brought under
control in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.  Admission U/A was consistent with
UTI, and urine cultures grew cipro resistant, nitrofurantoin
sensitive E. Coli.  She was transferred to the floor where she
continued her course of nitrofurantoin, was followed closely by
[**Last Name (un) **] for her diabetes, and was diuresed due to her
decompensated diastolic heart failure.  She had episodes of SVT
while on the floor which became less frequent.

# Hyperglycemia: Etiology of her increased insulin requirement
remained unclear but was hypothesized to be due to an occult UTI
given her UA showing WBC.  She was initially on an insulin drip
in the ICU which was subsequently converted to U-500 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
recs.  Her hyperglycemia remained within her baseline range,
200-300, on a sliding scale with U-500 given four times a day at
specific times similar to when she might take her insulin at
home.  She was discharged on U-500 four times daily
(90/100/60/60).

# Urinary tract infection:  She was initially begun on
ciprofloxacin; when sensitivities for E.coli came back resistant
to cipro on [**2158-8-31**], she was started on a 7 day course of
nitrofurantoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Her foley catheter was removed
shortly after arriving on the floor, where she completed her
antibiotic course.  She was asymptomatic while on the floor.

# Decompensated dCHF:  She was ruled out with troponins WNLs x
2.  She was initially started on lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and metolazone
5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  In the ICU, she required PRN IV lasix to maintain 0.5
to 1L negative daily.  Her SOB improved on this regimen.
Cardiology consulted, recommending more aggressive diuresis.
She was on IV lasix only upon transfer from the ICU with goal
1-2L negative daily.  To meet this goal we increased her IV
lasix from 20mg [**Hospital1 **] to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] in addition to the metolazone.
By the time of her discharge she was asymptomatic from a
respiratory standpoint but still with significant peripheral
edema.  She was discharged on her home dose of 80mg lasix PO BID
in addition to metolazone.  On the floor, 5mg lisinopril daily
was added.  She maintained a HCO3 of approximately 34 throughout
her stay, likely a contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive
diuresis.  Her baseline HCO3 is unclear.

# CAD: When the patient arrived on the ICU, she was complaining
of SOB and chest pain, for which she had multiple unchanged EKGs
from prior. Chest pressure in the AM is common for her and is
not what she considers her angina.  Her home plavix was
discontinued in the ICU as there was no obvious indication for
it.  The remainde
