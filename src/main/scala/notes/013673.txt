Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84 year-old female
with a history of CREST, diverticular disease, irritable
bowel syndrome, and prior upper GI bleed in [**7-19**] secondary to
AVM and gastritis.  Her previous UGIB required
hospitalization, which was notable for a hematocrit of 16 on
admission, 11 units of packed red blood cells transfusion
during stay, 2 units of fresh frozen platelets,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing gastritis and normal
duodenum, cauterization of a gastric AVM, and angiography
followed by embolization of left gastric artery.

She presented to the Emergency Room at this time with a chief
complaint of two days of dark stools, left lower abdominal
pain and weakness.  She denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, lightheadedness, fevers or chills, and night sweats.
No bright red blood per rectum, no hematemesis.  In the
Emergency Room she was found to be in no acute distress and
with a temperature of 99.5, blood pressure 143/53, pulse 86,
respirations 16, 98% on room air.  Nasogastric suction
revealed 200 cc of coffee grounds and lavage with 250 cc H20
showed coffee grounds and a bright red tinge, but lavage was
stopped, because of patient discomfort.  Central line in
femoral vein was placed and she was given one liter of normal
saline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Gastrointestinal:  The patient presented
with an upper gastrointestinal bleed with a hematocrit of
29.9, melena left lower quadrant pain and coffee grounds with
red tinge on nasogastric lavage.  To look for a source of
bleed, several procedures were done.  An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**6-18**], which showed
diffuse gastritis and a normal duodenum consistent with what
was seen during admission a year before.  On [**6-25**], enteroscopy
showed improved gastritis and a normal duodenum and jejunum.
Colonoscopy on [**6-29**] showed retained melena and multiple
nonbleeding diverticula, but no source of bleeding.  A tagged
red cell scan on [**6-23**] did not identify a source of
gastrointestinal bleeding either.  H-pylori antibody test was
negative.  She was on supportive therapy with Protonix 40 mg
b.i.d. and Carafate, but she had continuous gastrointestinal
bleed as manifested by guaiac positive stools, both melena
and bloody stool and unstable hematocrit throughout most of
her stay.

On the evening of [**7-1**] (hospital day fifteen), the patient
had a dramatic gastric bleed with a hematocrit drop from 27.7
to 17.4.  The patient became more tachycardic then baseline
to 130s, but maintained her blood pressure.  Nasogastric
lavage at this point revealed bright red blood with clots
that did not clear with 420 cc of H20.  She was transferred
to the MICU where she received 6 units of packed red blood
cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets.  She was taken
to the IR the next morning where the left gastroduodenal
artery was embolized empirically.  By hospital day seventeen,
the patient decided that she wanted no more blood product
transfusions and wanted CMO.

On the evening of hospital day seventeen, the patient was
transferred back to the Medicine Floor with stable hematocrit
of 36.7.  However, one day after the transfer, her hematocrit
dropped to 24.1 with bloody diarrhea.  The patient
reexpressed her wishes for CMO and did not want any more
laboratory tests or any blood product transfusions.

By hospital day twenty the patient appeared stable with
stable tachycardia and blood pressure.  It appeared that
gastrointestinal bleeding either slowed or stopped, so after
discussion between the patient and the family and a
hematocrit check was done, which at the value of 26.4 showed
that she had stopped bleeding.  Two more units of red blood
cells were transfused to increase her hematocrit to at least
greater then 30.

2.  Hematology:  At presentation the patient's hematocrit was
29.9 and was unstable throughout most of the admission.  She
received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells.  Some
hematologic workup was done to look for other causes of
continued bleed, which was negative for GIC, hemolysis and
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease.  Two of five studies (epinephrine
and arachidonic acid) for platelet aggregation were abnormal
so she was given Desmopressin intravenous times two doses
([**6-24**] and [**6-27**]) and one bag of platelets, which did not help
stabilize her hematocrit.  A total of 5 units of fresh frozen
platelets were also given, because of multiple red blood
cells could have diluted the concentration of her clotting
factors and less likely, because of the possibility that she
had a coagulopathy given one PTT value.  Hematology/oncology
consult did not feel that the patient had platelet
aggregation abnormalities or a coagulopathy.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's antihypertensive
medications (Atenolol, Aldactone, Lasix) were held during her
hospital stay so that if she were to stop bleeding briskly,
her sympathetic system may respond appropriately to maintain
blood pressure.  Her vital signs remained stable with a blood
pressure in the 140s/80s and heart rate in 80s until hospital
day five when she started having sinus tachycardic 100 to
130s.  At this time she also developed a urinary tract
infection, so the tachycardia was thought to be secondary to
infection or dehydration.  She was given normal saline
intravenous to lower the heart rate to the 110s.  During the
remainder of th hospital cou
