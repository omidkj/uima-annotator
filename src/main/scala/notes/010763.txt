admissions for DKA, substance abuse who is 6 weeks pregnant.
She is admitted for the second time in two weeks, this time with
hypoglycemia.  She had misunderstood her insulin dosing
instructions and was dosing her insulin sliding scale before and
after meals.  Her correct dosing is pre-prandial only.  Her
hospital course was complicated by labile blood sugars which
required ICU admission and an insulin drip for better control.
There was no evidence of DKA.  Pt recieved further teaching
regarding the management of her diabetes.  Pt also c/o tooth
pain and has appt w/dentist as op.

On [**10-18**] pt was transfered to the Gyn floor where her finger
sticks ranged from the 20s to 200s.  [**Last Name (un) **] service was
following and adjusted her insulin regimen.

On [**10-19**] pt was discharged.  For DM management, she now takes NPH
