CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)

INDICATION: Preoperative assessment prior to BKA procedure.

The patient is status post prior median sternotomy. The heart is
upper limits of normal in size and stable. Pulmonary vascularity
is normal. The lungs are clear, and there are no pleural
effusions. Mild degenerative changes are seen within the spine.
Finally, note is made of a right PICC line, terminating in the
superior vena cava.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CATH Study

BRIEF HISTORY:   52 yo woman with a long well-documented history
of
peripheral arterial disease, s/p many percuateneous
interventional
procedures on her right lower extremity including, most
recently,
directed thrombolytic therapy and throbectomy for an occluded
recent
bypass graft to her RLE. She now returns to the lab with
probable
re-occlusion of her graft.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Limb threatening peripharal arterial disease


PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography demonstrated a total
occlusion of
the SFA at just proximal to the proximal graft anastamosis.
Heparin was
started prophylactically. A stiff angled Glidewire was advanced
though
the native SFA into the distal popliteal artery were angiography

demonstrated the AT and PT to be totally occluded and the
peroneal
artery to be patent as the main blood suppy to the foot but with

moderate diffuse disease. The Glide wire was exchanged for a
Mircale
Bros 6 wire and atherectomy of the distal SFA into the distal
politeal
artey was performed. A wire was passed into the AT and distal
injection
confirmed that there was no distal runoff via the AT and flow
did not
improve with atherectomy of the origin of the AT. We were unable
to
cross in to the PT with a wire. We then turned our attention to
the
peroneal artery where atherectomy was performed on the proximal
and mid
vessel with restoration of flow into a large distal collateral,
however
the PT never filled. A distuption was noted in the mid peroneal
artery
at this point with diminished flow into the distal artery. In
spite of
thrombectomy with an Excisor catheter and several balloon
inflations
with 2.0 mm balloons. The case was terminated due to excess
flouro time
and contrast load. Final angiography revealed no significant
impprovement in blood flow to the foot.


COMMENTS:
1. Arterial access was obtained in retrograde fashion via the
LFA with a
6 French short sheath.
2. Selective angiography of the right lower extremity revealed
the SFA
to be totally occluded just proximal to the anatamosis of the
graft.
3. Failed percutaneous intervention on the right lower
extremity. Final
angiography revealed no restoration of flow into the
infrapapliteal
vessels (see PTA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Total occlusion of the right SFA.
2. Failed intervention on the right SFA and infrapopliteal
vessels.

PICC W/O PORT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with R SFA-AT bypass with L arm v. Graft
reexploration and thrombectomy.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please place a midline in RUE. Unable to get PIV on floor.
Unable to get midline on floor. We want to d/c her R IJ.
HISTORY: Status post right SFA-AT bypass with graft
reexploration and thrombectomy. Needs IV access.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The right upper arm was prepped and
draped in the usual sterile fashion. Since no suitable
superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for
localization of a suitable vein. The basilic vein was patent and
compressible. After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% lidocaine,
the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance
with a 21 gauge needle. A 0.018 nitinol guidewire was advanced
under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava. It was determined
that a length of 37 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was
trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French introducer sheath
under fluoroscopic guidance in the superior vena cava. The
sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed. Final chest x-ray
was obtained demonstrating the tip to be in the superior vena
cava. The line is ready for use. A Stat-Lock was applied and the
line was heplocked.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 37 cm long right basilic
single lumen PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava. The
line is ready for use




Brief Hospital Course:
