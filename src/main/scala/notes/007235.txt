History of Present Illness:
This is a 76-year-old woman in excellent health overall. She
recently presented with vague left upper quadrant pain and chest
complaints. This was worked up through a chest CT scan which in
fact showed evidence of a large cystic mass in the left upper
quadrant of the abdomen upon review of the abdominal slices. She
was sent to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for endoscopic ultrasound
evaluation and cyst analysis was performed. He saw mural nodules
and solid components to this very large cyst but the aspirate
itself was negative for malignancy. I then got involved and we
performed a dedicated CT angiogram of the pancreas to evaluate
this. What we found was a large space-filling mass with
attenuation of the stomach in front of it. This cyst had solid
components with septae within it and was very concerning for a
mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma.
I discussed the need for distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy
with her in great detail. We planned to do this operation in 2
weeks time in an elective fashion. However, she returned to me
10 days prior to this operation with evidence of pneumonia. This
was treated and she recovered and felt much
better from that. This was a left lower lobe pneumonia in the
setting of atelectasis on that side, probably from this tumor
mass. She got better from this but still had poor p.o. intake
and had a very low albumin. For this reason, I elected to keep
her in the hospital and give her TPN for a number of
days.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 F with LUQ pain x 2wks, CT and MRI at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital
revealed a pancreatic tail mass

Pneumonia: She presented with LUQ pain and a new dry hacking
cough, and low grade temperature. A pre-op CXR showed Moderately
large left pleural effusion with left lower lobe
consolidation/collapse - evidence of pneumonia. She was treated
with Levoquin and she recovered and felt much better.

Malnutrition: Due to her low Albumin, she remined in the
hospital on TPN while being treated for the PNA.

She then went to the OR on [**2159-9-12**] for: distal pancreatectomy,
splenectomy, cholecystectomy and bowel resection.

Post-op Hypotension: She stayed the night in the PACU for
hypotension and then was transferred to the SICU to wean off the
pressors.
She also received crystalloid bolus for low urine output and
Albumin for plasma expansion.
Post-op Blood Loss/Anemia: She received 3 units of PRBC.

Pain: She had an epidural for pain control. APS decreased the
solution to 0.05% Bupiv with Dilaudid in order to assist getting
her off pressors.  The epidrual was D/C'd on POD 4 and a PCA was
started. Once on a diet, she was tolerating PO pain meds and had
minimal pain.

GI/Abd: She was NPO with a NGT. The NGT was d/c'd on POD 3. His
diet was slowly advanced, starting with sips. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] amylase
was checked on POD 6 and was 25. Her drain was D/C'd later that
evening. She continued to have drainage from the drain site and
suture was placed... Her staples were D/C'd on POD ...She was
tolerating a regular diet at time of discharge.

Pathology: Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, arising in a cystic
mucinous neoplasm, see synoptic report. a.  There is
ovarian-type stroma in the wall of the cyst. b.  Focal
calcification of cyst wall.
2.  The carcinoma extends into the submucosa of the attached
colon segment.
3.  Focus of ossification at one end of the colon segment.
Lymph Nodes 4 of 13 involved.
Oncology was consulted and she will follow-up as an outpatient.

Vaccines: She received meningococ vaccine on [**9-16**], pneumo and
Hib were given prior.

The patient was discharged on [**9-19**] home in stable ocndition.
