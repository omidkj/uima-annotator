History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7749**] is a 83 year old woman with a history of CAD s/p cath
[**12-24**] with stent LCX and RCA, ESRD on HD for the past 5 weeks,
Hep B cirrhosis and COPD who is transferred from [**Hospital1 25986**] and Rehab Center with STEMI.
.
She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**1-19**] to [**2-2**] with
left lower lobe pneumonia and ESRD and started on HD. She was
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of her pneumonia.
Over the past week, she was noted to have increasing cough with
white sputum production, bronchospasm, shortness of breath and
orthopnea. She was treated with IV solumedrol and biaxin which
was changed to prednisone 60 mg on [**2-25**]. She was continued on
levaquin and vancomycin and nebulizers. She was seen by
pulmonary and they felt her wheeze and sob were due to CHF
rather than COPD exacerbation. On [**2-25**] they were unable to
complete dialysis due to clotted access catheter. On [**2-25**] she was
started on 100 mg IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and zaroxyln with good response.
ECG done [**2-25**] elevation in the inferior leads which
were new compared to ECG from [**2152-2-2**]. ECG was repeated on [**2-28**]
and showed similar ST elevation that was slightly decreased. CK
was 115, CK-MB was 41 and TnI was 14.88. She was transfered to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. Of note her aspirin was
discontinued one week prior to admission due to platelet count
of [**Numeric Identifier 17445**].
.
In the ED the patient reported that she has been having chest
pressure for several days. The pressure is worse with
inspiration and expiration and worse with cough. She has had
cough and shortness of breath for one month. She reported [**5-31**]
chest pain, radiating to her right shoulder. In the ED she
received aspirin 325 mg, heparin 5000 bolus and 300 mg plavix.
She was brought to the cath lab.
.
Cath: findings notable for mod LMCA calcification, LAD mod calc
with diffuse disease, LCX with non dom vessel, RCA occ mid
segment with L --> R collaterals, RCA lesion dilated and then
Taxus stent x 5.
.
Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].
.
ROS: Reports 5/10 chest pain that is slightly better than prior
to cath. Worse with inspiration and expiration. She feels short
of breath and feels like she has sputum that she cannot get up.
She denies abdominal pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting. Feels
her legs are restless.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
calcified LMCA but no critical stenosis. LAD had some moderate
diffuse
disease. LCX was a non-dominant vessel without critical lesions.
RCA was
totally occluded through its mid-vessel course with some distal
flow to
the PDA territory via L->R collaterals.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred given CRI.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated right-sided
filling
pressures consistent with volume overload. There was mild to
moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
4. The acute total occlusion of the mid RCA was predilated with
1.5 X
6mm Sprinter and 2.5 X 30mm maverick balloons, stented with 2.5
X 20mm,
3.0 X 20mm, 3.0 X 15mm and 3.5 X 32mm Taxus stents and post
dilated with
3.0 X 15mm NC ranger balloon with lesion reduction from 100% to
0%. The
final angiomgram showed TIMI flow with no dissection and no
embolisation. (see PTCA comments)
5. R femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6Fr angioseal.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3 Successful stenting of the mid RCA lesion in the setting of an
Acute
inferior STEMI
[**2152-3-2**] CXR:
HISTORY: Shortness of breath and cough. Recent MI. Please
evaluate for CHF versus pneumonia.

AP upright and left lateral views of the chest show interval
clearing of pleural effusion seen on the patient's prior
portable study from [**2152-1-26**]. No focal consolidation is
seen to suggest pneumonia and the pulmonary vasculature is not
congested. Moderate cardiomegaly appears stable and soft tissue
mass at the right upper mediastinum has been shown to be
vascular on previous cross sectional imaging studies. Tunneled
dialysis tubing is seen with distal tip at the level of the
right atrium and the proximal tip at the level of the SVC/right
atrial junction. Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is seen in the
arch of the aorta.

CONCLUSION: No CHF or pneumonia.
[**2152-2-29**] Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
