History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 54 y/o man w/ a PMH significant for HTN who developed
substernal chest pressure while working outside in his yard.  He
went inside and lay down on the floor in front of the fan where
he was found by his wife.  She called EMS and he denied fall or
LOC when they arrived.  He received aspirin, nitro, and NS and
was transfered to the [**Hospital3 3583**].  In [**Hospital1 46**], he was
hypertensive to 164/118 and bradycardic to 42.  His EKG was
significant for complete heart block with ST elevations in II,
III, aVF, and V3-6 as well as ST depressions in I, aVL, V1-2.
He was started on heparin, aggrastat, asa and morphine prior to
being transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].  Of note, his wife said that he has
developed mild pedal edema over the past few days and states
that his exercise tolerance has dropped recently.
.
In the cath lab, he was seen to be actuely vagal with
hypotension and emesis.  He was also acutely acidotic and
hypoxic.  He was intubated for airway protection.  An
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed secondary to his
hypotension.  He had several episodes of VT that aborted with
amiodarone 150mg bolus and lidocaine 75mg bolus.  He was started
on an amiodarone drip.  His cath demonstrated a totally occluded
mid-RCA that was stented.  His RPL was ballooned.  His right
sided filling pressures were elevated with a PCW 37, RA 27, RV
62/18, and PA 62/38.  He had no step up.  He received 80mg of
lasix in the lab.

.
ECHO [**8-21**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferio-lateral hypokinesis. The RV size and systolic function
are probably within normal limits (suboptimal views). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
a fat pad.
.
Cath [**8-21**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
acute occlusion of a large right coronary artery before it gave
off any
marginal branches.  The LMCA had no significant disease.  The
LAD had
mild diffuse luminal plaquing up to 40% along its length.  The
LCx was
non-dominant and had no significant coronary artery disease.
After the
RCA thrombotic stenosis was treated, there was evidence of
distal
emoblization with an abrupt cut off of the terminal R PDA.
2. Hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right heart
filling
pressures.  The RV and PA pressures were elevated above 50mm Hg
systolic, suggesting some element of chronic pulmonary
hypertension.
The cardiac output and index were preserved however this was in
the face
of dopamine infusion which was probably causing some degree of
splanchnic vasodilation and L > R shunting.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Successful placement of temporary 5 French pacing wire during

procedure for heart block via the right femoral vein without
complications. The pacing wire was removed at the conclusion of
the
procedure.
5. Successful placement of 8 French, 40 cc IABP via the left
femoral
artery under fluoroscopic guidance without complications.
Appropriate
systolic unloading and diastolic augmentation were noted with
invasive
hemodynamic measurements.
6. Intubation for hypoxemia, acidemia, and airway control during
the
procedure without complications and with fluoroscopic
confirmation of
appropriate ETT placement.
7. Successful treatment of culprit mid-RCA with a 3.5 x 18 mm
Cypher
drug-eluting stent postdilated with a 3.75 mm balloon. Final
angigraphy
demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
8. Successful treatment of thrombus migration to the r-PL using
balloon
inflations with a 2.5 x 15 mm Voyager balloon. Final angiography

demonstrated no significant residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection, and normal flow


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a 54 y/o man w/ a PMH significant for HTN who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cath in the setting of an acute
infero-posterior STEMI.
.
1. CAD - pt presented after an acute infero-posterior STEMI and
received an RCA stent.  he was intubated during this process for
respiratory compromise in the setting of cardiogenic shock
during his catheterization.  he was started on aspirin, statin,
bb, plavix, and ace in the post-catheterization setting.  he
received an echo showing an EF of 45% and
inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis.  he developed a large
hematoma at the groin site that resolved throughout his stay.
he did not have cp after the intervention and tolerated PT
evaluation w/out complaint.  he was d/c home on his inpatient
medications w/ close follow-up.
.
2. Hypotension: the patient developed cardiogenic shock during
his catheterization requiring IABP and dopamine.  he received 9
L total between OSH and [**Hospital1 18**].  he was weaned off both the
pressors and iabp in the ccu in the days after his
catheterization w/out problem.  his bp was monitored w/ an
a-line until transfer to the floor.  he was started on bb and
ace after his pressors were weaned and his pressure had
normalized.  he tolerated both of these well and was d/c home to
continue bp titration as an outpatient.
.
3. Arrhythmia - pt w/ VT in the cath lab that spontaneously
aborted and was most likely secondary to ischemia and subsequent
reperfusion.  he was transiently placed on an amiodarone drip
overnight but was taken off this the next morning and did not
have recurrence of arrhythmia throughout his stay.
.
4. Respiratory - pt w/ a hx of asthma and was intubated for
airway protection during cath.  he bit through his ngt while in
the ccu and was noted to have aspirated.  empiric abx were
started and the pt subsequently developed a fever/wbc bump that
responded well to abx.  he was slowly weaned off his sedation
and extubated successfully foll
