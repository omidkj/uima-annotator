Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2474**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
51 yo M with h/o asthma and right lung volume loss of unclear
etiology (?congenital hypoplasia), recurrent bronchitis in
winter, OSA, obesity, HTN who presented with 1 week of
productive cough, progresssive SOB, and over the past 2 days
weakness and fatigue to the point he was falling asleep at work.
He tried increasing his albuterol use but this did not help so
he came to the emergency room.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.5 P109 BP101/56 R24 79% on RA
on presentation, 100% on NRB. The ED resident noted that he was
not particularly wheezy on exam. Labs notable for WBC of 5, HCT
34.5, sodium of 131 and creatinine of 1.0. Patient was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, nebs and 125 IV methylprednisone.
He had a CXR which was inconclusive, possible RML pneumonia.
Also be very tachycardic, EKG shows sinus tach. Got a CTA for
concern of PE-but no PE, but some increased interstitial
markings in RUL and RLL, more likely chronic process vs.
pneumonia. Tried to wean him down on 02, as soon as he would
fall asleep would desat. Right now, 40% venti mask and he is
[**Age over 90 **]%. Vitals on transfer, 99/5, HR 106, 127/87, 23.

On the floor, the patient notes that he feels fine while lying
still, but worse with movement. Denies sick contacts, recent
travel, new pets. Only recent med change is stopping zoloft 1
month ago. He worked previously in the printing business and
thinks he could have been exposed to some chemicals.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Micro:

date)
[**2-12**] MRSA screen pending
[**2-12**] Urine culture and legionella- negative
[**2-12**] RSV screen negative

Imaging:
[**2-12**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2-12**] CXR:
SINGLE FRONTAL PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: As compared to prior
study there is minimal increase in right mid - lower lung
opacity . Right lower lobe pleural thickening is grossly stable.
Bullous changes denoted by relative lucency in the right upper
lobe are again noted and unchanged. Prominent right mediastinal
- paratracheal soft tissue remains unchanged. Left lung is
clear. Heart is not enlarged. The aortic contour is grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Minimal interval increase in opacification of the
right mid -
lower lung is better evaluated on subsequent CT from same day.

[**2-12**] CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Right lung volume loss could be due to a congenital anomaly
or pulmonary infection early in life.
3. Persistent area of round atelectasis in the right lower lobe
with
increased size slightly since [**2166**].
4. New subpleural septal thickening in the left upper lobe and
medial basal left lower lobe, new since [**2166**] and suggestive of
an interstitial fibrosis.
5. Mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node.

Given the pulmonary interstitial findings and mildly enlarged
lymph node,
followup high-resolution CT is suggested, preferrably in 3
months if not
needed earlier.

[**2-14**] Transthoracic echocardiogram:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process, e.g., pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.5 P109 BP101/56 R24 79% on RA
on presentation, 100% on NRB. Labs notable for WBC of 5, HCT
34.5, sodium of 131 and creatinine of 1.0. Patient was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, nebs, and methylprednisone.  He
had a CXR which was possibly suggestive of RML pneumonia, and a
CTA that showed no signs of PE but did reveal some increased
interstitial markings in the RUL and RLL, more consistent with a
chronic process vs. pneumonia. the patient was admitted to the
ICU for monitoring on [**2-12**]. He had in past refused CPAP for his
OSA but accepted it and reported he had an unusually restful
night. He was transferred to the medicine floor on [**2-13**].

#  Hypoxia: His increased cough and the CT and chest Xray
imaging were most consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia
with underlying chronic pneumonic process, and he will need
another high-resolution chest CT in 3 months to evaluate
progression of these findings. In the ICU, he continued
antibiotic treatment for CAP. He did not receive further
steroids. He had an Echo that showed RV enlargement, free wall
hypokinesis & moderate elevation of PASP. Although these
findings were consistent with possible pulmonary embolism, he
had a CTA on admission that was negative for PE. Pulmonary was
consulted and felt his right heart find
