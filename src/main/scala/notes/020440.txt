Service: UROLOGY

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6157**]
Chief Complaint:
epididymitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
incision and drainage of Fournier's gangrene

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male who was transferred from an
outside hospital because of a suspected myocardial infarction on
[**2166-8-10**] and possible need for cardiac catheterization.  He was
admitted to the cardiology service initially.  His symproms
actually began six days prior to admission with flu-like
symptoms.  Then five days prior to admission, the patient began
complaining of a painful lump in his left testicle.  His
symptoms gradually worsened, with increasing pain, erythema, and
edema of his left testicle.  In addition, he complained of
difficulty urinating for two days prior to admission.  He was
admitted to an outside hospital four days prior to admission
here, at which time a Foley catheter was placed and he was
started on IV Levofloxacin and Clindamycin (which was switched
to Levofloxacin and Vancomycin the following day) for
epididymitis diagnosed by ultrasound.  The ultrasound also
showed questionable air in the scrotum.  The patient was seen by
a urologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as an infectious disease
specialist.  He denied any trauma to his scrotum.  He has no
significant urologic history.  His prostate examination revealed
a 20 to 25 gram nonfluctuent prostate.  He is not diabetic and
he is not immunocompromised.  He reported that his pain has been
improving on the antibiotics.  However, on the night prior to
admission he developed acute pulmonary edema, shortness of
breath, hypotension and EKG changes suggestive of myocardial
infarction (ST elevation in leads V1-[**Street Address(2) 23394**] depression in
V5-6).  His peak troponin was 0.96.  Neo-synepherine was started
upon admission because of hypotension, which was presumed to be
secondary to sepsis.  Significant cardiac history includes a
CABG in [**2141**], hypertension, aortic stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, high cholesterol, and congestive heart failure
(EF of 40%).  Upon re-evaluation at this hospital, his EKG
changes were thought to be secondary to demand ischemia, rather
than a myocardial infarction.  In addition, the patient was
noted to be in acute renal failure, with a createnine of 1.8 on
admission, likely due to prerenal causes.  Blood and urine
cultures from the outside hospital were all negative.
