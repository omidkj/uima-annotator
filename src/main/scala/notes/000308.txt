Chief Complaint:
Ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, anasarca, and inability to
tolerate HD for fluid removal

Tunnelled Left Internal Jugular Hemodialysis Catheter
Left Femoral Hemodialysis Catheter
Right Femoral Triple Lumen Catheter
Left PICC line
Debridement of Sacral Decubitus


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2121-12-18**] for [**Date Range 1106**] surgery
evaluation of right heel ulcer. She was started on
vanco/cipro/flagyl on admission to cover an infection. On
hospital day 2 ([**2121-12-19**]), she underwent right peroneal
angioplasty on [**2121-12-19**] and was put on an argatroban drip for 24
hours following the procedure. On [**12-20**], she was noted to be
hypotensive to 72/37 and hypothermic to 94.6. Cardiac enzymes
were checked and were noted to be positive. She was transfused 2
units packed red blood cells on [**12-20**]. Plastic surgery was
consulted for evaluation of sacral decubuti, but declined to
debride wound due to aspirin/plavix/argatroban use. She
underwent HD on [**2121-12-21**], but they were unable to remove fluid
due to low blood pressures. When renal evaluted her on that day,
there was concern that her mental status was not at baseline and
her words were not well enunciated. They recommended sending
blood cultures and broadening antibiotics but no intervention
was undertaken at this time. Cardiology was consulted on [**12-21**]
for bradycardia, hypotension, and elevated cardiac enzymes and
recommended discontinuation of beta-blockers. An echo was
performed on [**12-22**] which showed new regional wall motion
abnormalities. Given hypotension, anasarca, and inability to
tolerate HD due to low blood pressures, patient was transfered
to MICU for CVVHD.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient reports right hand pain. She
denies any other complaints. No abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest
pain.

RADIOLOGY
ECHO [**2121-12-22**]: EF 55%, Normal left ventricular cavity size with
regional systolic function most c/w CAD. Mildly dilated RV with
mild global hypokinesis. Mild pulmonary arterial systolic
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
RIGHT HEEL [**2121-12-24**]: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior
radiographs from [**2116-3-19**]. There is no soft tissue gas
or large ulceration within the right posterior heel. There are
large plantar spur which is unchanged since [**2116**] study.
Extensive [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] calcifications are seen. There is no bony
destruction to indicate acute osteomyelitis. There is overall
demineralization of the bony structures.
.
RIGHT UE VEINS 11/25,[**12-24**]
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Patent AV fistula, right
antecubital fossa.
.
RIGHT ARM ARTERIAL DOPPLERS [**2121-12-29**]: Findings as stated above
which indicate poor right radial artery flow with improvement
with compression. Note of radial artery calcification.
Calcifications are new when compared to a prior AV fistula study
performed in [**2116**].
.
RIGHT FOREARM [**12-26**] Interstitial edema. No evidence of abscess.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**12-26**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue wound inferior to the coccyx, with induration and
inflammatory changes within the subcutaneous fat extending to
the rectum, with inflammatory changes involving the posterior
wall of the rectum.
2. 4.3 cm fat-containing anterior abdominal wall lesion,
consistent with a
fat-containing hernia, not significantly changed in size
compared to [**2117-1-1**] with a focus of central hyperdensity which
may represent an engorged vessel.
3. Fractures of the right lateral ninth and eighth ribs.
4. A 15 mm cystic lesion inferior to the pancreatic head, which
may represent a side branch IPMN or other mucinous lesion, for
which further evaluation with MRCP is recommended.
5. Nodular appearance of the liver surface, consistent with
cirrhosis.
6. Anasarca and ascites.
7. Left inguinal lymphadenopathy, with a single prominent node
measuring up to 11 mm in short axis diameter.
.
TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND [**2121-12-31**]: The patient is post-menopausal.
Transabdominal examination is significantly limited due to lar
