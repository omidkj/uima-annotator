History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 63 yo man with h/o diabetes, high cholesterol and
back pain who was admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital today for
"evolving stroke".  Called his PCP friday with complaint of
"dizziness" and was started on a meclizine.  Symptoms stable
over the weekend per family.

Then today was at work making lunch and suddenly felt a "[**Doctor Last Name **]"
sensation in his ear.  Then weak and dizzy and helped himself to
floor where co-worker found him and called 911.  When EMS
arrived was noted to be dysarthirc and with equal grasp and
equal smile. Vomitted several times en route.  Had blood sugar
of 268.  On arrival to [**Location (un) **] still had dysarthria but no
weakness.  Was complaining of severe posterior headache and
nausea on arrival.

At [**Location (un) **] was found to have Right Cerebellar infarct on CT.  A
repeat CT later showed interval progression of the infarct.  MRI
was consistent with acute infarct of right PICA distribution and
MRA could not show PICA.

Was very hypertensive there up to 205/111 and was given multiple
doses of IV labetolol.  Continued to be difficult to manage
pressure.  Developed worsening of the headache later in evening
and had pressure of 184/102 at that time.  CT at this time
showed interval progression of infarct.  Was given Fentanyl
25mcg and transferred.  Was reportedly dysarthric, lethargic but
A+O x 2 with no weakness on transfer.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes, high cholesterol and back pain

Social History:
Married and has several children in the local area.

Unknown

ext: no edema

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Eyes closed.  Arrouses and opens eyes to voice.
Following commands.  Oriented to [**2196-1-28**] and [**Hospital 86**] Hospital.

Very dysarthric and only able to give single word answers.
Somewhat drowsy and eyse closing during exam but re-arrousable
with voice.  Examination was stable during first 20 minutes in
the ICU and then acutely decompensated over period of minutes
going from following commands and speaking to unresponsive/not
talking but moving all four.  Was then emergently intubated.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2.5 to 2 mm moderate
speed bilaterally. Visual fields are full to confrontation. On
right lateral gaze unable to abduct right eye more than just
small ammount past midline but left eye adducts completely.  On
left gaze, has perhaps very mild impairment of left eye
abduction
but right eye adducts well.  No nystagmus and up/down gaze
intact.  Sensation intact V1-V3 to LT.  Face weak upper and
lower
on right but some movement.  Hearing intact to finger rub
bilaterally.  Palate elevation seems poor but equal.  Tongue
midline but weak.

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone normal. No observed myoclonus or
tremor
No pronator drift.  Strength was intact and equal in triceps,
biceps, grasp, IP, Quads and dorsi/plantar flexion.

Sensation: Intact to light touch in BUE and face.

Reflexes:
+2 and symmetric throughout.
Toes upgoing bilaterally left greater than right.

Coordination: finger-nose-finger intact left and perhaps mildly
dysmetric on right, heel to shin intact bilaterally.  Did not
check [**Doctor First Name **].

Gait: deferred

Romberg: deferred

Head CT ([**2-23**], admission):
1.  Large right cerebellar infarction, with hemorrhagic
transformation.
2.  Upward transtentorial herniation, and downward herniation of
the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum.
3.  Hydrocephalus, with enlargement of the lateral and third
ventricles.
Urgent neurosurgical consultation was recommended.

Head MRI/MRA ([**2-24**], post op):
MRI BRAIN:  Restricted diffusion in the right cerebellar
hemisphere is
consistent with the patient's known infarct in this area.
Additional areas of restricted diffusion in the left cerebellar
hemisphere and the left superior cerebellar artery distribution.
 A tiny focus of increased signal intensity on
diffusion-weighted imaging in the left occipital lobe is thought
to be related to infarction.  The right cerebellar hemisphere is
largely edematous, with mass effect on the adjacent pons, and
effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Superior and inferior cerebellar herniation appears unchanged,
allowing for differences in modality.  Prominence of the lateral
and third ventricle is also unchanged.
Susceptibility artifact in the frontal extra-axial spaces
bilaterally is
consistent with previously noted pneumocephalus.  Isolated focal
areas of
FLAIR signal hyperintensity consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia.
The signal intensity characteristics of the remaining brain
parenchyma are
within normal limits.  The surrounding soft tissue and osseous
structures are unremarkable.

MRA OF BRAIN:  The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are
patent.  In particular, both superior cerebellar and posterior
cerebral arteries are patent. There are no areas of significant
stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Right SCA territory infarct and edema, as previously
described.  Allowing for differences in modality, effacement of
the fourth ventricle, mild lateral and third ventricular
hydrocephalus, superior and inferior cerebellar herniation are
stable status post craniotomy
2.  Small subacute left SCA territory infarct.
3.  Bilateral superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral
arteries remain
patent.

Neck MRA ([**2-26**]):
MRA NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The right vertebral artery
is not
visualized on the 2D time-of-flight images.  On the
post-gadolinium 3D images, segmental visualization of a tiny
right vertebral artery is identified, indicating marked
hypoplasia of the right vertebral artery.  A moderate grade
stenosis of the origin of the left vertebral artery from the
subclavian artery is identified.  Otherwise, the left vertebral
artery is unremarkable throughout its course through the neck.
There are mild atherosclerotic changes involving the carotid
bifurcations bilaterally without evidence of significant
stenosis.  The carotids within the neck and base of the skull
are otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Markedly hypoplastic right vertebral artery.
2.  Moderate grade stenosis at the origin of the left vertebral
artery.
3.  Mild atherosclerotic disease involving both carotid
bifurcations without evidence of hemodynamically significant
stenosis.

TTE ([**2-23**]):
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)  are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic  regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with  trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
