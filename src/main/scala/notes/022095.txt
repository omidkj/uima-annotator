.
Pt states he was flying from [**Location (un) 41654**] to [**Location (un) 5953**] when he
noticed dizziness and severe fatigue when he tried to get up to
use the restroom. When the flight landed he noted extreme

and weakness. On landing at [**Name (NI) 789**] pt decided to go to [**Hospital1 **]
ED given his status. At [**Hospital1 **] he underwent CTA which showed
large b/l PEs. He was noted to be guaiac negative there.
Thrombolytics were not used given HD stability, pt was started
on a Heparin gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were noted to be T98.2, HR 90, BP
156/87, RR 20, Sat 98%. He was continued on his Heparin gtt and
admitted to the ICU.
.

(+) He endorses SOB, c/o URI symptoms during the journey from
USA to [**Location (un) 41654**] but no hemoptysis. He has chronic lower extremity
swelling which increased on the LLE>RLE (he wears a compression
stocking over the RLE only) during the flight.  (-) Denies
fever, chills, chest pain or tightness, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia.

Pertinent Results:
[**2122-11-7**] Lower extremity US:

.
[**2122-11-7**]: CXR Portable:
IMPRESSION: Prominent pulmonary hila consistent with known
pulmonary emboli.  No evidence of other pulmonary abnormality.
.
[**2122-11-7**] CTA chest:
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images were obtained at [**Hospital1 **] and submitted for a second opinion.
.
FINDINGS: Within the bilateral pulmonary arteries, there are
multiple filling defects consistent with pulmonary emboli.
Emboli within the right upper lobe branches, right middle lobe
branches and right lower lobe branches are identified. In
addition, emboli in the left upper lobe branches and left lower
lobe branches are identified. The lingular branches remain
patent. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The airways are patent to
the subsegmental level.
.
Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
identified. Degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine
are noted.
.
IMPRESSION: Extensive pulmonary emboli seen in both lungs as
described above.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male with h/o recent air travel, HTN p/w acute dyspnea
and found to have bilateral PEs.
.
##. Bilateral PEs: patient was initially monitored in the ICU
given extent of clot burden, but always remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was initially on 2L NC, but quickly oxygenated well
on RA. CTA showed significant b/l pulmonary embolisms, with
extensive clot burden. Lower extremity US was negative for DVT.
Patient was started on a heparin gtt immediately upon arrival.
He did not receive thrombolysis given hemodynamic stability.
Hypercoagulation work-up was deferred given the history of PE in
setting of extensive air travel as well as possibility of
confounding results while on anticoagulation.
Hypercoagulability work-up may be addressed by his primary care
doctor.  Coumadin dosing was as follows: [**2122-11-7**] - initiation
of coumadin (5 mg), [**2122-11-8**] (7.5 mg), [**2122-11-9**] (7.5 mg),
[**2122-11-10**] (10 mg), [**2122-11-11**] (7.5 mg), and [**2122-11-12**] (7.5 mg). INR
was 2.1 the day prior to discharge and 2.9 on date of discharge.
Heparin gtt was used as a bridge and was discontinued on date of
discharge. Patient instructed to have INR checked on Saturday,
[**2122-11-14**], with results to be discussed with primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**0-0-**].  Patient discharged on 7.5
mg coumadin daily, with adjustment per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] informed of
the narrow therapeutic window of coumadin and how it will
require close monitoring with frequent blood tests to check the
INR. A handout regarding coumadin was provided to patient as
well.
.
##. HTN: continued on home regimen of Irbesartan.
.
##. Obesity: continued on home regimen of Meridia.
.
##. OA of Right knee: continued on home regimen of Darvocet-N.
.
##. Leukocytosis: mild leukocytosis of 12.1 on admission, likely
related to his PE versus his recent URI symptoms. Patient's WBC
normalized and he was afebrile throughout hospitalization.
.
##. Chronic venous insufficiency: patient with mild RLE and LLE
swelling.  He was continued on compression stockings and was
prescribed these on discharge.
