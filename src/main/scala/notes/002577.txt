Echo [**2182-4-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal for the patient's body size. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %).
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-3-16**],
the heart fate is higher and left ventricular systolic function
is slightly more vigorous. The left ventricular ejection
fraction may have been slightly underestimated in the prior
report. . Estimated valve area is slightly higher in the current
report.

Chest X-ray [**2182-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence for pulmonary
edema. Suspected tiny or small pleural effusion on the left.

Chest X-ray [**2182-4-16**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged mild cardiomegaly
and small bilateral effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
89yM with CAD and systolic CHF, moderate AS, on aspirin and
[**Year (4 digits) **], admitted with severe anemia and melena.

# GI Bleeding. Hct on admission 22; baseline 30-32. Thought
secondary to UGIB (gastritis, PUD). ASA/[**Year (4 digits) **] stopped on
admission. Seen by GI; given multiple cardiac problems, any
procedure would need to be done by [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] deferred. Hematocrit
stabilized off ASA/[**First Name3 (LF) **]; GI bleeding thought secondary to
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this should be permanently discontinued. Metoprolol,
lisinopril, and torsemide held in setting of GI bleeding.
Hematocrit after [**4-12**] was stable, ranging from 25-30%. Received
a total of 5 units pRBC's during admission (last on [**4-16**]);
hematocrit at discharge 28%. No bowel movement in 3 days at time
of discharge. Discharged on pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].

# Acute on chronic renal failure. Creatinine 2.7 at time of
admission (baseline 2.0-2.2). Creatinine was as low as 1.7
during the admission. Bumped from 1.7 to 2.2 when lisinopril
initially restarted; this medication was discontinued again and
should be restarted as an outpatient. Torsemide to be restarted
on discharge.

# Coronary artery disease. [**Hospital1 **] discontinued. Aspirin
restarted three days prior to discharge with subsequent stable
hematocrit. Statin continued. Metoprolol restarted two days
prior to discharge, and lisinopril to be restarted as
outpatient.

# Chronic systolic heart failure. Well-compensated throughout
the admission. Change in x-ray demonstrated accumulation of mild
bilateral pulmonary effusions (diuresis was held during the
admission). I's/O's closely monitored, and he remained euvolemic
throughout the admission. Beta blocker restarted during
admission, torsemide to start as outpatient, and lisinopril to
be restarted within one week of discharge.

# Delirium. Noted to have reversed sleep/wake cycles during the
admission, with subsequent confusion. Improved with trazodone,
to be continued on discharge.

# Gout flare. On [**5-6**], patient had low-grade fever and
bilateral great toe pain. Given one dose of colchicine with
resolution of fever and pain.

# Hyperlipidemia. Continued statin.

# Hypernatremia. Did develop hypernatremia during
hospitalization. Resolved with increased PO fluid intake.

# Full Code, confirmed with patient.
