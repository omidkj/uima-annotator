Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
pericardial effusion post- pacemaker placement for symptomatic
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84-yo woman with CAD s/p multiple prior MIs
and s/p DES to LCx [**2128**], stable AAA, CKD (bl Cr 2.35), atrial
fibrillation, and h/o asymptomatic sinus node dysfunction, who
presented to the ED at [**Hospital3 3583**] with dizziness. She first
noted the dizziness approx 2 days ago, which was associated with
nausea and vomiting, and yesterday she also developed diarrhea
and decreased appetite. She notes a single episode of a small
amount of hematemesis, and that her diarrhea was soft and black
(but always is given that she takes iron supplements and stool
softeners). She also developed palpitations and chest tightness
with radiation across the left side to the back, for which she
took two sublingual nitroglycerin with relief, but she continued
to have dizziness and unsteadiness. She did not have any
associated diaphoresis. She denies any recent fevers, chills, or
sweats. She does not have any recent ill contacts or exposures.
She does also note persistent positional right flank and back
pain.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital3 3583**], she was thought to have
symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with a junctional escape
rhythm in the 30s. Her nausea and vomiting were thought to be
additional evidence of symptomatic bradycardia, and the diarrhea
was thought to be [**2-16**] poor forward flow. Her first set of CEs
were negative (CK 57, trop 0.01). Her labs revealed an elevated
creatinine to 3.69, which was also thought to be [**2-16**] dehydration
and hypovolemia. Her CXR showed no evidence of CHF. A
CT-Abdomen/Pelvis was done given the back pain and known AAA,
which showed a small right pleural effusion, multiple renal
cysts and bilateral non-obstructive nephrolithiasis, as well as
a stable large fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm and stable
thick mural plaque along the aorta.
.
She was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for
dual-chamber pacemaker implantation, which was complicated by
hypotension. The patient had received 4mg of Versed for
agitation, so she was treated with three separate doses of
Flumazenil with good effect, and increase in her SBP to 100-150,
although she again became hypotensive at the end of the case.
She was transferred to the ICU, where an echocardiogram revealed
a small to moderate sized circumferential effusion with possible
mild diastolic collapse in the right ventricle. She received an
additional dose of Flumazenil as well as a dose of Narcan with
improvement of her systolic blood pressure to 90-100. She is
being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for close observation. Post
procedure hematocrit was also noted to be 24, so she is received
1 unit of PRBCs in transit.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, or hemoptysis.
She notes black stools [**2-16**] medications. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for the presence of chest
pain that was relieved with SL NTG, and dyspnea on exertion, but
the absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, or syncope.

IMAGING STUDIES:
CXR [**2133-7-3**]:
No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette
with tortuosity of the aorta. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary
vessels raises the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous
pressure. Pacemaker device is in place with the leads in the
_____ area of the apex of the right ventricle and the right
atrium.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. There is, however, an area
of vague
opacification at the right base laterally that could represent a
developing
consolidation. This area should be evaluated on subsequent
images.

ECHO [**2133-7-4**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60-70%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion
around the RA/RV, without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Small, loculated pericardial effusion. Normal global
and regional biventricular systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-8-10**],
pericardial effusion is new. The other findings are similar.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2133-7-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small hemopericardium and indeterminate soft tissue in the
mediastinum,
which may represent a small mediastinal hematoma versus a left
atrial
appendage. If clinically indicated, a CT with contrast is
recommended to
further evaluate these findings.
2. Abdominal aortic aneurysm up to 6.1 cm with dystrophic
calcification
within mural plaque or displaced intimal calcification which is
likely
chronic. Comparison with prior exams, which apparently are
available at an
outside hospital is crucial to e
