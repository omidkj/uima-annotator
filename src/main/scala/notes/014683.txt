Chief Complaint:
Cough, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of severe AS, diastolic CHF and rectal
prolapse admitted with non-productive cough and shortness of
breath. The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-20**], [**2160**] with a new diagnosis of rectal prolapse. The patient
went to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab until 1 week prior to admission. She was
doing well at home until the evening prior to admission when she
noted persistent non-productive cough and shortness of breath.
She described unmeasured, subjective fevers associated. The
patient denies chest pain, medication noncompliance, new lower
extremity edema or orthopnea. She does note a possible sick
contact in her roommate at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab who was noted to be
coughing profusely.
.
In the ED, the patient was saturating 94% RA, 100% on
non-rebreather. She was noted to be febrile (rectal temp 100)
with a leukocytosis. Chest x-ray suggestive of CHF, though
unchanged from prior admission. She was noted on EKG to be in
MAT, resolved to normal sinus rhythm with PVCs. She received
Furosemide 40mg IV x2, vancomycin 1gm IV x1 and Levofloxacin
500mg x1. She was successfully weaned to 4L NC prior to
admission to the floor.
.
ROS: Denies chills, nightsweats, headache, chest pressure, chest
tightness, abdominal pain, vomiting, dysuria. She endorses
frequent skin irritation, nausea and incontinence of bowel and
bladder function at baseline.

Blood Culture x2 ([**2160-4-13**]) Pending
No prior culture growth at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Portable CXR ([**2160-4-13**]): Improvement in previously noted CHF
with persistent moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
Persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely represents
atelectasis and effusion, however again underlying infection
cannot be completely excluded.
.
CXR ([**2160-3-18**]): CHF with bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely
atelectasis and effusion, but underlying infection is not
excluded in the appropriate setting.
.
Echo ([**2160-2-7**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved cavity
size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional systolic function. Severe calcific aortic stenosis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of severe AS, diastolic CHF and rectal
prolapse admitted with non-productive cough and shortness of
breath. Brief hospital course by problem below:
.
# Cough, shortness of breath. Differential initially infectious
+/- CHF. Known sick exposure: rehab roommate. Febrile in the ED
with leukocytosis. Serial CXR with increasing L sided pleural
effusion. Etiology of effusions from CHF vs para-pneumonic vs
PE. Diag/Therapeutic Thoracentesis [**4-14**]- procedure service
consulted and 900cc taken off. Diuresis was continued with 40mg
IV lasix PRN with close attention to volume status given
pre-load dependence secondary to severe AS.  Captopril 6.25 tid
initiated for afterload reduction. Albuterol and ipratropium
nebs for wheezing on exam and symptomatic improvement.
Levofloxacin started for possible respiratory tract infection.
MI ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes complete. On HD 3,
pt developed tachycardia to 140s, and continued to be
tachypneic. ABG: 7.16/104/39. Pt was transferred to the ICU for
closer monitoring and possible Lasix drip. Pt is DNR/DNI and
refusing BIPAP.  In the ICU, pt. continued to have difficulty
with respiration and was repeatedly asked about non-invasive
ventilation.  Attempts were made to improve ventilation with
diuretics, IV steroids with minimal effect.  After discussion
with patient's son, decision was made to make patient comfort
measures only.  Patient was taken off antibiotics, diltiazem,
and given morpine for respiratory distress.  She expired
peacefully.
.
# Severe AS, valve area <0.8. Not a surgical or invasive
candidate per recent note by outpatient cardiologist. Close BP
monitoring with cautious diuresis as above.
Added low-dose captopril to reduce afterload and improve cardiac
function.  Cardiology consulted and felt that she was not a
candidate for balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
.
# Relatively elevated Cr. Stable. Likely secondary to poor
forward flow in the setting of CHF exacerbation. Trended Cr.
Optimized volume status.
.
# Modest troponin leak. Likely demand ischemia +/- relative Cr
elevation and decreased excretion. Consistent with recent
troponin baseline. Completed rule out MI with 3 sets of cardiac
enzymes which were negative.
.
# GI: History of GERD and PUD. Continued Pantoprazole 40mg
daily.
