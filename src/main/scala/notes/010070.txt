History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15011**] is an 87 year old woman with past medical history of
HTN, glaucoma, OA, and recently diagnosed pancreatic/[**Known lastname 499**] CA
with ?liver mets who presented s/p unwitnessed fall at her
[**Hospital3 **] facility. She was found on the ground by her
aide complaining of severe right hip pain.

In the ED, the patient was found to have low HCT 23.6. She was
crossmatched 4 units and consented. She was placed in a C-collar
and had a CT C-spine. Xray showed right hip fracture. She was
given IV Morphine for pain control.

Overnight, the patient was transfused 2 units of pRBCs. She was
unable to answer questions appropriately [**1-13**] to pain. She does
not remember anything from the fall. The daughter reports that
the patient is ambulatory at baseline and relies on her aide for
all ADLs.

RADIOLOGY:
CT C-Spine ([**2194-10-27**]) -IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture of the cervical spine.
2. Minimal anterolisthesis of C4 over C5 and C7 over T1 and
minimal retrolisthesis of C5 over C6 of indeterminate age, but
could be degenerative.  Clinical correlation advised. Severe
osteopenia and degenerative changes.  MRI is a more sensitive
modality to evaluate for ligamentous or spinal cord injury.
3. Sub-cm right thyroid nodule. 1.3 x 0.9 cm nodule posterior to
the right lobe of the thyroid may represent a parathyroid
adenoma versus a thyroid nodule. Correlation with thyroid
ultrasound on a non-emergent basis suggested.

CT Head ([**2194-10-27**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
abnormality.

Hip X-Ray ([**2194-10-27**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur
extending to the lesser trochanter with varus angulation.
2. Severe osteopenia.

Wrist X-Ray ([**2194-10-28**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Right wrist -- Colles fracture with dorsal angulation of the
distal radial articular surface. Question acute or subacute.
2. Left wrist -- findings essentially representing SLAC wrist
(scapholunate advanced collapse), unlikely to be acute. No acute
fracture identified. No chondrocalcinosis.
3. Bilateral severe osteopenia and osteoarthritis.

CXR ([**2194-10-29**]) - IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe atelectasis
with pleural effusion could be due to aspiration. Early followup
chest radiograph recommended.

CXR ([**2194-10-29**]; at time of MICU transfer) - As compared to the
previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Borderline
size of the cardiac silhouette, moderate retrocardiac
atelectasis. Presence of minimal left-sided pleural effusion
cannot be excluded. No evidence of overhydration. No focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pneumothorax.

CXR ([**2194-11-3**]; at time of MICU callout) - IMPRESSION:
Significant interval improvement in multifocal airspace
opacities.

Echo ([**2194-10-30**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2 -1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic/[**Month/Day/Year 499**]
cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis who
presented on [**2194-10-27**] with right hip and wrist fractures after
an unwitnessed fall.

# Unwitnessed Fall, Right Hip and Wrist Fractures - The patient
presented with right hip and wrist fractures after an
unwitnessed fall.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she received one liter
of normal saline and morpine 4 mg IV x 2. CT-c-spine was without
fracture. CT head was without acute process. Hip xray showed a
right intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur
extending to the lesser trochanter with varus angulation. She
was admitted to the medical service for further management. She
underwent open reduction and internal fixation of right hip
fracture and closed reduction or right distal radius fracture.
She tolerated the procedure well but had agitation
post-operatively which was treated with IV haldol. On POD#1 she
was noted to have acute hypoxia, tachypnea and tachycardia.  She
was ultimately transferred to the MICU for further management
(see below).  While in the MICU, she had an echo which showed
mild atrial stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, severe
pulmonary artery hypertension, and an EF of 75%.  After she was
called out to the floor, PT and OT were consulted.  At the time
of discharge, PT recommendations included transfer training,
balance training, and bed mobility.  The patient was ultimately
discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

# Hypoxia, respiratory distress - At approximately 2 PM on POD#1
she was noted
