Images:
admission EKG: Irregular supraventricular rhythm, borderline for
multifocal atrial tachycardia, and then probable sinus
tachycardia
.
12/1/0: Abdominal ultrasound: 1. Enlarged liver with patent but
pulsatile portal vein. This reflects increased resistance within
the portal vein, likely from diffuse liver disease, though the
hepatic echotexture is normal. Gallbladder wall edema also
likely reflects sequelae of liver dysfunction. No ascites.  2.
Markedly enlarged spleen as was seen on outside hospital CT of
[**2194-1-20**]. Patent splenic vein with normal flow direction.
.
[**2196-12-2**]: ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The leaflets
appear thin/mobile, but the transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis (?related to the dynamic
left ventricle). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Increased
gradient across the aortic bioprosthesis (?related to dynamic
left ventricle). Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
.
[**2196-12-5**]: LENIs: 1. Proximal left greater saphenous vein thrombus
without extension to the common femoral vein. This finding can
be present post saphenous vein graft sequalae (cardiac bypass
surgery).
2. No additional evidence of superficial or deep venous
thrombosis.
.
[**2196-12-7**]: CXR: Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
with upper zone redistribution and infrahilar hazy opacity _____
moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Presumed bilateral
pleural effusions, if present, are small. No pneumothorax.
Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 64 yo female with polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], myelodysplastic
syndrome, and myeloid metaplasia who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2196-12-1**] with two weeks of fatigue, melena, and decreased Hct.
She had EGD [**2196-12-2**] which only showed friable mucosa but no
evidence of bleeding site. Hct drop was thought to be [**2-4**] cold
agglutin hemolytic anemia from mycoplasma infection and pt was
always guaiac negative per review of notes. Prednisone 60 mg po
qday was started on [**2196-12-4**]. Pt received 12 units of pRBC from
[**2196-12-1**]- [**2196-12-7**]. On [**2196-12-7**] pt desatted to 83% on RA and was
tachypnic. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Of note, Hct was 18 at
that time but had just received 1 unit of pRBC. She was
intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was thought to
have flash pulmonary edema. She was transfused 2 units of PRBC
and diuresed with lasix > 1 L. EKG was reportedly unremarkable.
She was able to extubated on [**2196-12-8**]. She was diuresed 2 L the
next day and returned to BMT service on [**2196-12-9**].
.
Complicating this was ARF to peak of 2.2. She was given
allopurinol, bicitra, sodium bicarb, D51/2 for lysis with
elevated uric acid to 14. On [**2196-12-11**] rituxin was added for the
hemolytic anemia. This am, pt felt SOB, was satting 90% on RA
(after receiving rituxin in 600 cc fluid). She denied CP but was
noted to have altered mental status and was only oriented x 1.
CXR showed b/l pulmonary edema. ABG was 7.43/48/58. Pt was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BIPAP and intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], noted to have an EKG showing
STE in V4-V6, III. She given ASA 300 mg PR, Clopidogrel 600 mg
po x 1, and started on heparin gtt. Cardiac catheterization
showed a 70% left circumflex lesion, not thought to be the
culprit and not intervened upon. It also showed LVEP of 40 mm
hg, mod MR, minimal wall motion abnormality of inferior wall,
and EF 50%. She was then transferred to the CCU and then MICU
teams. BP decreased to 80s systolic with ventricular ectopy and
run of SVTS. She was started on neosynephrine. A-line was
attempted multiple times and fem a line was placed.
.
Ms [**Known lastname 48658**] was found to be anuric with a lactacte of 15.  she was
also found to have focal neurologic signs with deviation of the
right eye and lack of corneal reflex.  She went for head CT
which was unrevealing.  THe family was contact[**Name (NI) **] because of her
extremely poor prognosis; the decision was made to not escalate
care.  She died shortly after from cardiac arrest.
