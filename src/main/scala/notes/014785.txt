Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophageogastroduodenal endoscopy x 3
Variceal banding (?)
Paracentesis x 2

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, Afib, seizure
disorder, schizophrenia, presents from nursing home with
complaints of chest pain.  Story unable to be verified with
patient as he is very sedated from morphine and poor historian.
Per ED signout, patient was having [**7-9**] mid-left sided chest
pain which may have radiated to his left hand.  While at the
nursing home, he received 3 tablets of SL NTG which did not
relieve the pain, so he was transferred to [**Hospital3 **].
There, he was found to have troponin of 21.9 and found to have
ST elevations in III and AVF with some mild ST elevations in
V2-V3.  Patient received fentanyl and morphine with some
resolution of pain.  He also received ASA, lipitor, and
kayexalate for K of 5.7.
.
There was some confusion about his DNR paperwork at the nursing
home, it was poorly documented who his HCP is.  His daughter was
listed, but when called, she said she was unsure if she was the
HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cath as it
was uncertain what his code status was and who the HCP is.
.
In the ED, VS were: 98.5, 99/60, 72, 18, 100%RA.  Patient
complained of whole body pain, but did not seem to have true
chest pain.  He received 4mg of morphine with resolution of
pain.  Warfarin was held as his INR returned at 4.4.  Troponin
was 3.04.  CXR showed hazy atelectasis.  EKG was repeated and
showed subtle V2-V3 ST elevations.  A bedside TTE showed mild
hypokinesis along the inferior wall, questionable if there are
changes from previous TTE.  Patient had received 600 mg of
plavix on arrival to ED, but it was decided later that cardiac
catheterization would not be pursued for now.  On transfer,
patient's vital were: 97.7, 117/74, 67, 14, 99%2L
.
On the floor, patient is very sedated, likely from morphine.
His is only minimally responsive, will open eyes to touch, but
does not answer questions.

Pertinent Results:
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2165-3-13**] at 6:00:12 AM
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Radiology Report	CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2165-3-26**]
11:40 AM

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral small
pleural
effusions, with neighboring compressive bibasilar atelectasis.
No pulmonary
masses or nodules are detected. A small epicardial node is
present (2:7).
The heart is mildly enlarged, and demonstrates severe
atherosclerotic
calcifications within the coronary arteries. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Assessment of the solid abdominal organs is limited due to lack
of IV
contrast. The liver contour is nodular, compatible with known
history of
cirrhosis. A subcentimeter hypodense lesion within the right
lobe (2:22) is
too small to characterize. No other hepatic lesions are
identified. There is
a moderate amount of ascites throughout the abdomen. The
gallbladder is
distended, and the gallbladder wall is ill-defined, with
neighboring [**Name2 (NI) **]
stranding. A dependent hyperdense gallstone is present (2:
