History of Present Illness:
59 y/o M with PMHx of ESRD, CAD s/p MI, CMP, Seizure disorder
and CVA who fell in his apt on Sunday, two days prior to
presentation, and was reportedly found down by his landlord 48
hours later. Patient reports he had not eaten for 36 hours for
unclear reasons, and went to the bathroom and felt weak as he
got up to flush the toilet. Pt reports collapsing to the floor
due to weakness, hit his head, and was unable to get up because
he felt profoundly weak. Denies LOC, aura, alteration of mental
status, vision changes, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of
breath but reported several days of productive cough with
minimal white/yellow sputum. He reports the day prior to his
fall, he had eaten only breakfast and had 3-4 episodes of
non-bloody nausea and vomiting that night, which he attributes
to the food he ate that morning. Per report, pt pulled himself
to his bedroom and laid there for two days until found. However,
pt is now denying moving himself to his bedroom.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T99.2 , BP 113/62, R 20, unable
to get an O2 saturation anywhere. Pt was placed on 4L NC and had
an ABG with PaO2 123. Pt was found to be hypoglycemic on
arrival, and received 2 amps of glucose. Pt was complaining of
total body pain, but denied chest pain or abdominal pain. He was
placed in a c-collar due to total body pain. EKG showed NSR with
first degree block, LBBB with [**Street Address(2) **] depressions. Patient was
admitted to the floor in anticipation of dialysis and for
further workup and management.
.
Today, pt was notably tachycardic and hypotensive. He was given
boluses IVF and BP improved. Blood Cultures returned positive
for GPCs and CT revealed multiple lung abscesses. Pt was
transferred to the ICU given concern for sepsis with
leukocytosis, hypotension, +bld cultures and abscesses. On
transfer to the [**Name (NI) **] pt still endorses general malaise and full
body pain.
.
Review of systems:
(-) Denies any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
palpitations.
.


Social History:
The patient has a Ph.D. in history and had a successful academic

career until [**2103**], when he went on disability for unclear
reasons. The patient currently is homeless. Although patient
reports he is an organist and choir director at a local church,
the church does not corroborate this. He denies tobacco and
illicit drugs. ETOH twice weekly per his report

One son - healthy.

Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema
MSK: Pt noted to have diffuse 4-/5 with flexion/extension of
hip, dorsi/plantarflexion, flexion/extension in UE, Grip
strength. No specific focal deficits noted. Sensation is intact
and equal in b/l UE and LE. Toe Down Babinski's noted. Pt's
weakness is attributed to pain per pt.

Imaging:
.
CT Chest [**9-9**]:
1. Increasing moderate to large dependent bilateral pleural
effusions, which
are incompletely evaluated without intravenous contrast.
2. Multiple cavitating lung lesions of various sizes most likely
septic
emboli, predominantly in the left upper lobe and right lower
lobe.
3. Multiple dilated vascular structures in the anterior chest
wall and axilla
could potentially reflect collaterals in setting of central
venous
obstruction, but the latter cannot be assessed for in absence of
intravenous
contrast.
4. Left thyroid lobe goiter, unchanged.
5. Multiple renal cysts and calcified gallbladder stones,
incompletely
evaluated.
.
CT Head [**2117-9-8**]:
1. No acute hemorrhage or vascular territorial infarction
detected.If there is continued clinical concern of acute
infarct, an MRI with DWI is
recommended.
2. Interval increase in the opacification of bilateral maxillary
sinuses and frontal opacification.Multiple paranasal sinus
opacification could be related to the patient's intubated
status.
.
EMG [**2117-9-8**]:
Abnormal but nondiagnostic study. The denervation seen in
bilateral vastus
lateralis and left tibialis anterior could be consistent with a
neurogenic
process or with a myopathy with denervating features. The
inability of the
patient to provide a sustained muscle contraction prevents
accurate diagnosis or exclusion of a myopathic process. All
nerve conduction studies should be interpreted with extreme
caution due to the patient's edema
.
ECHO [**2117-9-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild-moderate regional systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and
septal walls. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF = 40
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-8-26**], the
findings are similar (global LVEF was underestimated on review
of the prior study).
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**] [**2117-8-30**]:
1. Diffusely low bone marrow signal on T1-weighted images, which
could be
related to anemia or chronic systemic illness, such as end-stage
renal disease
in this case. However, an infiltrative disorder cannot be
excluded.

2. Multifocal signal abnormalities in the discs and adjacent
endplates in the
cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine correspond to areas of
extensive
spondylosis and are likely caused by the spondylosis. However,
discitis/osteomyelitis may have similar appearance, though the
extensive
multifocality would be unusual. If there is a high clinical
suspicion for
infection at a particular level, then follow-up imaging of that
level may be
obtained in a week. There is no epidural collection to suggest
an epidural
abscess.

3. Mild spinal canal stenosis at C6-7. Spondylosis without
spinal canal
stenosis in the thoracic and lumbar spine.

4. Enlarged and heterogeneous thyroid gland. Further evaluation
by
ultrasound is recommended when the patient is stable, if not
performed
previously.

5. Partially visualized pleural effusions. The right pleural
effusion
appears loculated.
