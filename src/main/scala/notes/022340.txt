Chief Complaint:
ICH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x2
Stereotactic brain biopsy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74yo R-handed man with a history of MI,
hyperlipidemia and melanoma, who is transferred from OSH for an
ICH.

The patient was at home watching TV, when he suddenly became
unable to speak. He walked to his wife who was in another room
(normal giat, no facial droop noticed), and was only able to get
a few words out ([**Last Name (un) 46536**], [**Last Name (un) 46536**]). He could not give his wife the
name of his children or the date, and at that point she decided
to call 911.

At the OSH, he continued to be unable to speak, but otherwise he
seemed intact. A CT head revealed an ICH in the L-frontotemporal
region, with some edema, possibly underlying mass. He received
decadron 10mg iv before he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

When he arrived in the ED, he was still unable to speak. He was
unable to follow commands per nursing staff. Otherwise he still
appeared intact. Around 20.00 he had a seizure. He turned his
head and eyes to the R and then the seizure generalized. It
lasted a few minutes and he received ativan 1mg iv. He was
postictal for some 5 minutes, hardly responsive, but then seemed
to recover some. He was still not speaking. Then he became very
combatative and was intubated.

ROS: per wife he did not complain of any fever, chills,
headache, neck pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 74yo R-handed man with a history of MI,
hyperlipidemia and melanoma, who is transferred from OSH for an
ICH with possible underlying mass (L-frontotemporal region). He
presented with inability to speak and follow commands. He had no
symptoms otherwise. After transfer, he had a secondary
generalized seizure, after which he was intubated. On exam after
intubation, his CN were intact, and motor/sensory exam shows
some assymmetries (extension LUE). Tox screen was positive for
cocaine. At the OSH, he received decadron IV and he was loaded
on dilantin
in the ED.

NEURO:
Patient was admitted to Neuro ICU. Continued decadron and
dilantin. MRI showed an intra-parenchymal hemorrhage within the
left temporal lobe which demonstrated surrounding edema
suspicious for an underlying mass. He had a normal portable EEG
in the waking state. There were no areas of persistent focal
slowing, and there were no clearly epileptiform features. Blood
pressure was controlled with IV labetolol as needed and he was
extubated without complications. He was transferred to the floor
on [**11-9**]. On [**11-10**], patient had a seizure with loss of
consciousness, transient hypotension and was intubated for
airway protection. Patient was again transferred to the Neuro
ICU. He received a bolus of dilantin and extubated the following
day. He went for stereotactic brain biopsy on [**2144-11-12**] without
complication. He was transferred to the floor post-operatively.
Prior to discharge, patient was started on Keppra with the plan
continue transitioning from Dilantin to Keppra with appropriate
overlap. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic
as an outpatient.

CV:
Cycled enzymes which were negative and monitored on caridac
telemetry without events. EKG unchanged. Continued lipitor and
zetia. Held aspirin prior to biopsies. Unclear per notes,
whether patient was taking Plavix as well. He will follow-up
with his primary care physician as an outpatient and may resume
taking aspirin.

PULM/ONC: Lung mass was found on torso CT. There was a left
lower lobe 1.6 x 1.7 cm mass with ground-glass opacity in the
right upper lobe. A nodular peripheral opacity measuring 7 mm in
the left upper lobe, near the lung apex was also seen.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted. Patient had CT guided
biopsy on [**11-10**] and developed an asymptomatic small left
pneumothorax that was followed with serial chest x-rays and
treated with O2 nasal cannula. Pathology was pending at time of
discharge. Patient will follow-up with in [**Hospital 94667**] clinic
and get a PET scan per their recs. Of note, pelvic CT on [**11-6**]
noted an enlarged prostate with lobulated appearance, more
prominent on the right, it measures 7.1 x 5.6 cm in axial
dimension. Which will likely need to be monitored and further
evaluated as an outpatient.

FEN: Patient was on decadron and covered with insulin sliding
scale four times daily. He passed a speech and swallow
evaluation and was put on a regular diet.

PPX: Pneumoboots, Tylenol PRN
