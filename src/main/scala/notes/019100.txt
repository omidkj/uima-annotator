History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 75196**] is an 83 year old gentleman who underwent
lower anterior resection and diverting ileostomy [**2181-10-16**] for
rectal carinoma at [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**].  He developed feculent output
from the intraoperatively placed JP on POD 5, but remained
afebrile with stable WBC suggesting appropriate control of the
anastomotic leak.  The WBC rose today, however, and an abdominal
CT was planned, but the pt became acutely hypotensive,
tachypneic, and diaphoretic this morning.  He was intubated for
respiratory distress.  EKG showed q waves and 1 to 1.[**Street Address(2) 1755**]
elevation inferiorly, with ST depressions in lateral leads.
Labs showed CPK 68, Trop 3.570, Cre 2.8, lactate 1.9.  ECHO with
LVEF 30-35% with akinesis of the inferior, inferoseptal, and
inferolateral walls (no priors for comparison).  With a
diagnosis of acute inferior myocardial infarction, the patient
is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] for cardiac
catheterization.

[**10-25**]:ECHO Severe global left ventriculaure systolic function.
Normal right ventricular size and function.
[**10-29**]:White matter hypodensities without mass effect are likely
related to
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.No evidence intracranial
bleed.
[**11-8**]:pouchogram:No evidence of extraluminal leak.
[**11-12**] ECHO - EF 35%
12/13 CXR - some increase in the lung volumes
[**11-13**] RUQ US - large amt of R intraperit ascites. Non-distended
gallbladder containing small amt of sludge & tiny stones. No
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. CBD and pancreas not well
visualized.
[**11-14**]: CT abdomen: anastomatic leak; pelvic drain superficial,
likely just subq
[**11-16**] CXR: continued opacification in the retrocardiac region
consistent with volume loss in the left lower lung
[**11-17**] ECHO: similar to prior study from [**11-12**]. mild to moderate
LV systolic dysfunction w/ severe hypokinesis of the
inferior/inferiolateral walls. LVEF 35%
12/18 CXR: redemonstration of small pleural effusions and
increased density in the retrocardiac area c/w atelectasis or
consolidation. mild vascular congestion vs. low lung volumes.
[**11-18**] CXR: No significant interval change
[**11-18**] KUB: Limited study demonstrating findings consistent with
ascites
[**11-19**] CXR: Small stable bilateral pleural effusions and
associated
atelectases with continued mild pulmonary edema
[**11-21**] CXR: Increased bilateral pleural effusions, increased
moderate pulmonary edema
[**11-22**] CXR: maybe mild increase in extent of R pleural effusion.
otherwise unchanged.

to the kidneys bilaterally

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**]
for management of the MI, for which he underwent a cardiac
catheterization involving placement of 5 bare-metal stents by
interventional cardiology on [**2181-10-24**].  Care was provided in the
SICU.  The following day an abdominal CT showed a pre-sacral
abscess insufficiently controlled by the operatively-placed JP
drain, for which a CT-guided pigtail catheter was placed by
interventional radiology on [**2181-10-26**].  Broad-spectrum IV
antibiotics were continued consisting of Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Nutrition was provided with TPN.

He recovered from the septic and cardiogenic shock.  The
patient's mental status was slow to awaken, Head CT on [**10-29**] was
negative for acute pathology, all sedation and narcotic
medication was held, and eventually his mental status improved
to permit extubation, and eventually transfer to the floor on
[**2181-11-6**].  Aspiring and plavix were continued.  Nutrition was
transitioned to tube feeds via an NGT; he failed swallow
evaluations.  High ileostomy outputs revealed CDiff enteritis,
for which IV Flagyl and later vancomycin via both NGT and enema
(via the distal limb of the ileostomy) were instituted.  Later,
banana flakes and lomotil were added to s
