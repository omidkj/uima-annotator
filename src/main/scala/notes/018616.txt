Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11455**] is a previously healthy 41yo female who
presents now with a 5-day history of fevers to as high as 103,
intermittent N/V/D, and a 2-day history of progressively
worsening shortness of breath and cough.  Patient was in her
usual state of health until 5 days PTA, when she developed fever
with chills/diaphoresis.  Took acetaminophen and ibuprofen with
some relief.  The following day developed nausea and had two
episodes of vomiting.  Two days PTA, developed mild
non-productive cough, and continued to have fevers to as high as
103.  Per her report, was evaluated in her [**Hospital 6435**] clinic, given
anti-emetics, and told her lung exam was unremarkable.  However,
she continued to have progressive dyspnea and worsening cough,
and went back to [**Hospital 6435**] clinic earlier this morning.  Given
concern for patient's declining respiratory status, she was sent
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED for further evaluation.
.
At [**Location (un) 620**], O2 sats were initially 79% on RA, and improved only
to 80s on 3L NC.  Patient was placed on NRB, with improvement in
O2 sats to mid 90s.  Labs were notable for leukopenia (WBC 2.9)
with neutrophil predominance, hyponatremia (Na 120), and
hypokalemia (K 2.7), and lactate of 3.8.  Patient was given 3L
NS.  CXR demonstrated right sided PNA, and patient was given
levofloxacin 750mg x1.  Given respiratory distress, was felt
patient needed admission to an ICU, and as there were no ICU
beds available at [**Location (un) 620**], patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED here, initial VS were: 98.7 114 150/68 22 97% on NRB.
Patient's labs were not redrawn, as they had been drawn just
several hours prior at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  Repeat CXR showed a right
basilar consolidation with ill-defined patchy opacities in the
left lung base concerning for multifocal pneumonia, as well as a
moderate-to-large
right pleural effusion.  Patient had a flu swab done, and
received vanco/ceftriaxone, Tamiflu.  Given respiratory
distress, patient transferred to MICU for further management.
Vitals prior to transfer 110 105/62 26 96% NRB.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient still short of breath, but
overall reports improvement in symptoms.  States she has some
occasional chest discomfort secondary to coughing, but is
otherwise chest pain free.  Of note, her children, ages 2 and 5
months, have both had cold symptoms including fever, which
started a few days before the patient's symptoms began.  One
daughter diagnosed with PNA today as well.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Decreased PO intake.  Some loose stools, but
patient denies any bloody or dark tarry stools.  Had myalgias
several days prior to admission.
(-) Denies headache, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, frank
chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:  amenorrhea, PCOS
.
Past Surgical History: adenoids removed [**2093**], deviated septum
[**2105**]

CXR [**10-21**]: Right basilar consolidation with ill-defined patchy
opacities in
the left lung base concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
Moderate-to-large
right pleural effusion.

CT Chest [**10-21**]:
1. Multifocal pneumonia including right middle and lower lobar
consolidation.
3. Small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion.

CXR [**10-22**]: Large right lower lobe consolidation associated with
small amount of pleural effusion and multifocal opacities
including both the entire right lower lobe, right middle lobe,
and multiple foci in the left lower lobe appear grossly
unchanged with potential interval worsening of the right mid
lung consolidation. Mediastinal position is unchanged. There is
no pneumothorax.  There is, on the other hand, worsening of the
left lower lobe consolidation with obscuration of the diaphragm
that might be consistent with atelectasis, although rapid
progression of infection would be another possibility.

CXR [**10-23**]: Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Bilateral
consolidations in particular involving lower lobes are unchanged
associated with pleural effusion overall progressing since
[**2129-10-21**] and consistent with progression of multifocal
infection. No pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
41yo previously healthy female who presents now fever and
hypoxic respiratory distress in the setting of multifocal
pneumonia.
.
# Multifocal PNA leading to hypoxic respiratory distress:
Patient's symptoms, exam findings, fever, leukocytosis with
bandemia, and evidence of multifocal PNA on chest imaging
confirmed diagnosis. Patient was initially started on broad
spectrum abx with vanco/levofloxacin/ceftriaxone to cover for
CAP and possible post-viral PNA.  She was continued on
oseltamivir until flu swab came back negative.  Blood cultures
at OSH positive for pan-sensitive strep pneumo, and sputum
culture here showed GPCs in pairs.  Antibiotics were narrowed to
ceftriaxone.  The patient was continued on a NRB to maintain
sats in the mid 90s initially, and as her respiratory status
slowly improved she was weaned to 4L NC prior to transfer to
general floor.  She receieved an influenza vaccine prior to
transfer from MICU. On the floor, she was weaned to room air.  A
PICC line was placed for 4 weeks total IV antibiotic therapy.
In addition, patient continued to spike fevers, and ultrasound
of lungs showed loculated pleural effusion.  Thoracentesis was
performed draining 400cc of cloudy fluid wh
