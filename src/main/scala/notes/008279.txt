Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation / mechanical ventilation
peritoneal dialysis catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 50F w/PMHx of T1DM, HTN, stage V ESRD, and renal artery
stenosis with left renal artery stenting, who was brought to the
[**Hospital 794**] hospital by EMS after several days of nausea and vomiting
complicated by dyspnea.  Per report, she was found by a family
member in significant respiratory distress and EMS was called.
In the emergency department at OSH, she was found to be
hypertensive with SBPs to the 230s, with chest x-ray suggestive
of pulmonary edema (although it was also thought that it could
be consistent with either ARDS or pneumonia), and was
subsequently intubated. She was also found to have a
bun/creatinine of 73/8.09, a BNP greater than 5000, troponin of
2.84, and WBC 26K. The patient's hypertension was treated with
nitroglycerin gtt, hydralazine, and labetalol. Given the
possibility of pneumonia, she was given ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and zosyn.  She was also given rectal ASA due to
her significantly elevated troponin.
.
In the OSH ICU, the patient remained intubated, with vitals T
97.6, BP 153/77 p 100, SO2 100% on 50% FiO2.  Her hypertension
was controlled with a nitroglycerin drip. Given her significant
leukocytosis and possible pneumonia on chest x-ray, she was also
treated for pneumonia with azithromycin and vancomycin. An ECG
demonstrated Q-waves in leads V1-V3. An ECHO was performed which
demonstrated significantly impaired LV function with an EF of
20-25% (her previous ECHO in [**2194**] demonstrated normal LV size
and systolic function. Borderline concentric LVH. Visually
estimated EF ~ 65-70%). Although diuresis was attempted, she
experienced no significant improvement in breathing (lasix
120mg, metolazone, and Bumex all tried without success). A
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU was requested by the patient's
family.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated, with vital
signs of : T 37.4, p 91, bp 166/78, on CPAP/PSV of 15/5, with
respirations 23, on FiO2 of 40%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission: Pt is a 50F w/PMHx of T1DM, HTN,
stage V ESRD, and renal artery stenosis s/p left renal artery
stenting, who presents with respiratory distress thought to be
[**12-26**] flash pulm edema, severe HTN and acute on chronic kidney
injury.
.
Active Problems:
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: The patient presented in significant
respiratory distress in the setting of inability to tolerate POs
due to nausea and vomiting. Her systolic BP was 230 at the time,
and her respiratory failure was thought to be [**12-26**] flash
pulmonary edema due to BP medication non-compliance in the
setting of recent nausea and vomiting. She was intubated and
diuresed with 120mg IV Lasix with improvement in her pressures
and respiratory status. Ms. [**Known lastname 518**] was successfully extubated
on first hospital day and she was called out to the floor. She
remained stable on RA thereafter. At the time of discharge, she
was euvolemic and in no respiratory distress
.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely stress response from hypoxia and
intubation.  No evidence of acute infection.  Although
antibiotics were initially started, they were quickly
discontinued.  Ms. [**Known lastname 518**] remained afebrile and her white
count continued to trend down and had normalized at the time of
discharge. Blood and urine cultures were negative and
respiratory viral culture was also negative.
.
# DKA:  Patient with widening gap and ketonemia and ketonuria.
She was started on an insulin drip and her gap closed.  [**Last Name (un) **]
was consulted for further recommendations. Her BG control
improved though she did have a persistent AG acidosis, which was
felt to be due to uremia. Later in her hospital course she
became hypoglycemic to as low as 20 likely in the setting of
being NPO with poor po intake in addition to poor clearance of
insulin. Her insulin regimen was adjusted and she was discharged
with plans to follow up with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] would benefit from an
endocrinologist to follow her diabetes.
.
# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE:  Pt has stage V CKD due to chronic DM
and HTN and will require initiation of dialysis sometime in the
next few months. Renal was consulted and PD catheter placement
was agreed upon in accordance with the patients wishes. PD
catheter was placed on [**2199-12-18**]. Her medication regimen was
adjusted to include sevelemer, calcium acetate, and sodium
bicarbonate. She was started on torsemide and was euvolemic upon
discharge. Electrolytes were relatively stable. She was
discharged with plans to follow up with her nephrologist and the
PD nurse for teaching. She will follow up with [**Date Range **]
surgery within 1 week to evaluate her surgical site. She also
has plans to undergo workup for potential kidney [**Date Range **].
.
# CHF: At OSH, pt had TTE that showed EF 20%, concerning for
acute CHF exacerbation vs Takotsubo's, though no mention was
made of apical ballooning per report.
