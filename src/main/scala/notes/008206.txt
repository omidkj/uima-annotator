Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, headache, mental status changes.  Found to
have large cerebellar hemorrhage.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
You were evaluated by neurosurgery, however, decision was made
to manage medically given the risks of surgical intervention.


History of Present Illness:
80 y/o RHM with h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG and A-fib on coumadin
(full PMH and meds not known on transfer; OSH records and meds
request) presented to an OSH with nausea and headache. GCS 15
upon arrival to OSH. The patient describes acute onset of
dizziness w/o exertion followed by [**4-2**] frontal midline headache
and nausea/vomiting. He also noted difficulty walking straight
and describes veering to the left, spinning in a circle to the
left when walking. His son witnessed the event and called an
ambulance and he was brought to the hospital. The patient denies
trauma, vision changes, LOC, or difficulty speaking at the time.
A similar episode of acute dizziness without nausea/vomiting,
but
with so much spinning to the left that he had to put himself
into
a corner, occurred 6 months ago but resolved within 30 minutes
and no medical attention was sought.

At the OSH, he had persistent hypertension with BP of 190/110.
Head CT showed L cerebellar hemorrhage and the patient was given
10mg of vitamin K for an INR of 1.9. He was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**]
and while on route to [**Hospital1 **] the patient deteriorated with a GCS of
7. He was intubated and given fentanyl, succinylcholine,
etomidate and ativan. On admission he had an elevated Troponin
of
0.3 which has been trending down, likely due to demand ischemia.
His a-fib has been successfully rate controlled with metoprolol.
He was successfully extubated. Clinical exam has been stable and
no hematoma expansion or transtentorial herniation was seen on
repeat head CT.  Patient was transferred to Stroke service for
further neurological monitoring.


Past Medical History:
 CAD s/p CABG, HTN, atrial fibrillation, HLD, prostate CA s/p
radical prostatectomy, s/p bilateral cateract surgery,
presbycusis


Social History:
Patient has been retired for the last 10 years; previously
involved in "adapting machinery to be automated." Currently
lives
in [**Location (un) 5503**], MA by himself. He has a son and daughter who
live
nearby and visit him once a week. He denies tobacco and
illicits.
Has occasional EtOH.


Family History:
Father died of prostate cancer. No siblings.

Head CT [**2159-7-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
Large left cerebellar hematoma with mild effacement of the left
aspect of the quadrigeminal cistern. No significant
transtentorial or tonsillar herniation is seen.

Head Ct [**2159-7-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of large cerebellar hemorrhage
with surrounding
edema and mass effect on the pons.

Head CT [**2159-7-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Though measurements of the cerebellar hemorrhage are slightly
greater than
prior, this may be due to slice selection; if there is continued
concern,
interval continued followup is recommended.



Echo
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinetic septum, anterior hypokinesis and basal inferior
akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery syst
