Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for evaluation of pancreatic pseudocyst

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-1-14**]: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY
ERCP [**1-13**] - stent placed in CBD


History of Present Illness:
73 y/o M PMH CHF, CKD, [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH after prolonged
stay [**Date range (2) 89630**] for evaluation of pancreatic mass and
pseudocyst. Patient was admitted to the surgical floor and
underwent ERCP [**2146-1-13**] which demonstrated CBD obstruction and
stent was placed. Brushings during ERCP returned as malignant
and patient diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to
the liver (see imaging below). Due to a dilated gallbladder a
percutaneous chol was placed by IR [**2146-1-14**]. Patient was
transferred to the TICU [**2146-1-16**] due to hypotension and required
pressor support until [**2146-1-19**]. Swab from chol fluid grew MRSA
and patient was covered with Vanc/Cipro but etiology of
hypotension unclear and not felt to be septic shock. Patient's
course in the TICU was complicated [**Last Name (un) **], low urine output, pain
control and pancytopenia. Palliative care was consulted and
adjusted pain medication. Patient is not a surgical candidate
and cholangiocarcinoma is metastatic. Patient was on a lasix
drip from [**Date range (1) 5553**] due to volume overload (pleural effusions).
His urine output decreased from > 50 cc/hr to < 20 cc/hr on
[**2146-1-19**] and has not recovered. Today his heparin was stopped due
to thrombocytopenia. During his ICU stay patient's vital signs
ranged from BP 104-130/40-50, HR 66-80, O2 95-99% 2L. He is
being transferred to medicine for [**Last Name (un) **] and is not a surgical
candidate.
.
From surgical admission note review of OSH course: Admitted to
OSH [**12-16**] with complaint of shortness of breath and found to have
a hemoglobin of 5.2 with guaiac positive stool. Coumadin and
aspirin were discontinued and FFP given for INR reversal. EGD
[**12-17**] showed focal non-erosive fundal gastritis; patient declined
colonoscopy. Hematocrit remained stable and continued to
improve. While undergoing anemia workup on [**12-19**], patient
suffered spontaneous R pneumothorax requiring management with
surgical chest tube and eventual resolution per serial imaging.
Pulmonary function was further compromised by RLL/RML
consolidative pneumonia that was treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. Admission was also notable for onset of RUQ pain
on [**12-26**]. RUQ U/S and subsequent CT scans were notable for
cholecystitis though no cholelithiasis was appreciated. Imaging
also revealed a 6cm peripancreatic cystic mass with fluid that
was noted to change in character on interval imaging suggesting
evolving hematoma/hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst. Given
medical comorbidities, unasyn was started on [**1-9**] for presumptive
cholecystitis and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Pertinent imaging:

Images:
RUQ [**2146-1-13**]:
1. Marked intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation,
increased
compared to [**2145-12-20**], consistent with biliary
obstruction. Etiology not clearly identified, though changes of
acute or chronic pancreatitis are considered as a possibility
given the apparent pseudocyst in the pancreatic neck.
2. Markedly dilated gallbladder, as seen on OSH CT [**2146-6-19**], with minimal wall edema. There are small stones and sludge
seen within the gallbladder. The gallbladder distention could
relate to overall biliary obstruction. However, is not possible
to exclude cholecystitis.
3. Slight increase in size of avascular pancreatic cystic lesion
with
internal debris, centered at the pancreatic neck. This most
likely represents a pseudocyst, though a cystic malignancy
cannot be excluded.
4. Two focal hypoechoic liver lesions, as detailed above,
indeterminate by ultrasound.
5. Small ascites.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2146-1-14**]:
1. Ill-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass in the superior
pancreas and mid-distal common bile duct. No intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation, despite distal migration of the
biliary stent below the mass. The lack of dilation could mean
that the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is draining the
biliary system, however this is uncertain as the cystic duct did
not fill with contrast on ERCP and could be occluded and the
intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatic duct have not dilated
because the stent jsut recently migrated. Close follow up
recommended.
2. Interval increase in size and formation of two additional
pseudocysts with surrounding and pancreatitis, mass effect on
the superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein as well as the
stomach. No thromboses.
3. Multiple liver lesions concerning for metastases; early liver
abscesses considered less likely.
4. Increased amount of mural thrombus in the large infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm, which remains widely patent.
5. Lack of contrast excretion at three minutes following
contrast
administration. Recommend continued hydration and close
monitoring of renal function.
6. Increased amount of ascites.
7. Indeterminate right adrenal mass.
8. Abnormal appearance of the left elbow. Suggest correlation
with clinical symptoms.
9. Small residual pneumothorax and chest wall emphysema.
.
Liver ultrasound [**2146-1-20**]:
1. Splenomegaly, and small ascites.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature. The splen
