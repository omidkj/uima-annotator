Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, left face and arm weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 68 year old right handed male with a past
medical history significant for HTN and DM2, who presented from
an OSH with a right basal ganglia hemorrhage.

The patient was somewhat sleepy but able to tell the general
story.  There were no other witnesses currently present.  The
patient reported that he was at church this Sunday.  He felt
most
of the service was uneventful, he could remember getting
particularly upset or excited during the service.  He noted at
around 4 the service had ended and he was getting up to leave
and
noted he felt "dizzy"  He denied any vertigo but felt like he
was
having difficulties standing upright and was leaning to the
left.
He also noted that he was having difficulty keeping his hat in
his left hand.  He thinks someone also noted that he had a
facial
droop and he was sent to the local ED (which was [**Hospital3 **]).  About ~1-2 hours later he developed a left sided
headache, which then progressed to involving his whole head.
During this episode he was able to understand everyone around
him
and had no difficulty with communication.

At [**Hospital3 4107**] he was noted be hypertensive (180/100) and to
have face/arm and leg weakness.  He also was left alone briefly
and apparently had a fall.  He stated he was reaching for his
wallet and fell forward hitting his head on the floor.  He then
had a head CT which showed the right sided basal ganglia
hemorrhage.  He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

On neuro ROS, the pt reports a bifrontal headache.  He denies
any
loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia.  He has notable
dysarthria. No lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing
difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending
speech.  No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Past Medical History:
- DM2
- HTN
- history of ?blood clot in legs (unclear -> he is possibly just
describing varicosities, had a laser treatment in last few
years)


Social History:
Patient lives in an apartment by himself, but right
above his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] is a retired iron worker.  He has no
etoh, tob or drug use history.  His wife is deceased.

Some diabetes and HTN in the family, no known history
of stroke.  2 brothers died of complication of diabetes

Pertinent Results:
[**7-14**] EKG
Sinus rhythm with probable sinus arrhythmia and atrial premature
beats. Low amplitude lateral lead T wave changes are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2165-11-26**] atrial
ectopy is present and T wave abnormalities have decreased.

[**7-14**] CT Head
Acute 4 x 2 cm right lentiform nucleus hemorrhage with
surrounding edema and mild adjacent mass effect, as above. No
prior for
comparison. Findings are most likely due to hypertensive
hemorrhage, although underlying mass can not be entirely
excluded. Consider further evaluation with MRI if no
contraindication.

[**7-15**] CT Head
No interval change in right lentiform nucleus hemorrhage. No new

hemorrhage.

[**7-18**] ECHO
Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic
function.

[**7-19**] CT Head
Unchanged right lentiform nucleus hemorrhage. No new hemorrhage
or fractures.

[**7-19**] Renal U/S
1. No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
2. Moderate left hydronephrosis; CT recommended to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19825**]
(covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
3. Right polar cyst 1cm


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course: patient was admitted with R putamen hemorrhage in
the setting of HTN, DM2 and medication noncompliance. Exam was
somnolent but arousable to voice, L arm weakness in UMN pattern
and minimal L leg weakness. L facial droop was present. The
patient's blood pressure was controlled on nicardopine drip and
he was transitioned to oral agents (lisinopril 30 mg daily,
amlodipine 10 mg daily and hctz 25 daily). His sugars were
controlled on insulin drip until he was transitioned to his home
regimen of NPH 28 units [**Hospital1 **]. He had repeat CT imaging which
showed no changes, and was transferred to floor.

His BUN and Creatinine were rising on the floor, and his
lisinopril was discontinued and he was given IVF.  A renal
artery doppler showed moderate left-sided hydronephrosis without
arterial or venous abnormalities.  A TTE showed mild left
ventricular hypertrophy and a calcified mitral valve.

His mild hydronephrosis (seen on Renal U/S as above) should be
re-evaluated with a CT-a/p with contrast after his GFR returns
to baseline.

Medications on Admission:
- patient stated he was on insulin, and a medication for his
blood pressure but was not sure of the type or dose, was not
able
to provide his pharmacy (OMR medications date from [**2165**])
