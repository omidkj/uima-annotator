Brief Hospital Course:
46-year-old man presents with respiratory failure secondary to
pneumonia.
.
#. Pneumonia with empyema and sepsis: Community acquired, no
underlying risk factors, complicated by effusion.  Intubated on
admission as below.  BP was supported with IVF.  Pressors were
not required. Apparently failed a partial course of
levofloxacin.  Vancomycin and Zosyn were started for broad
coverage.  Flu swab and legionella antigen were sent and
negative.  Sputum cultures from OSH grew GAS, and shortly
thereafter sputum cx from [**Hospital1 18**] also grew GAS.  Antibiotics were
briefly narrowed to Penicillin, but when fever recurred this was
broadened to Zosyn. Pleural effusion was tapped and demonstrated
pH 7.02 consistent with empyema.  Chest tube was placed. On
follow-up the following day chest tube had stopped draining. CT
chest showed multifocal pneumonia no abscess seen.  He continued
on IV antibiotics while in house.  He was seen by Interventional
Pulmonary on [**2123-2-11**] for a Left chest ultrasound with Placement
of 18-French chest tube.  On [**2123-2-14**] Thoracic Surgery was
consulted for a loculated hydropneumothorax seen on Chest CT.
They recommended Left VATs decortication with 3 chest tube
placement which occurred on [**2123-2-15**].

#ID: infectious disease was consulted for group A strep empyema.
They recommended stopping vancomycin and Zosyn starting
ceftriaxone 2 g iv q24 x 7 days hours continue following
cultures.  On discharge he was converted to Cefpodoxime 200mg.
Consider acyclovir 400 mg po tid for empirical therapy of likely
oro labial HSV.
.
# Respiratory failure: Intubated in ED.  ARDS net ventilation
was initiated. He was quickly intubated after ~48 hours without
difficulty.  He was extubated on [**2123-2-12**] stable on BiPAP
overnight.  He was intubated for the L VATS  and was extubated
on [**2123-2-16**] without difficulty.  With aggressive pulmonary
toilet, chest PT his oxygen requirements improved and he was
discharged with oxygen saturations of 96%.

# Chest-tube 3 anterior apical, basilar and posterior apical
remained on low-wall suction draining moderate amount of
serosanguinous fluid changed to water-seal [**2123-2-17**] they changed
to pneumostats on [**2123-2-18**].  He was followed by serial chest
x-rays which showed resolution of left basilar pneumothorax and
stable effusion and atelectasis.
.
# Altered mental status:  For 24 hours after extubation patient
remained was arousable but not following commands. Given ongoing
fevers, lumbar puncture was performed which ruled out
meningitis.  His mental status returned to baseline following
treatment of his pneumonia.

## Chronic on acute pain. Per OMR records, the patient has
chronic right flank pain following a pyeloplasty for
hydronephrosis of the right kidney in [**2113-3-25**]. He has a
history of intercostal neuralgia and myofascial pain syndrome.
- Continue IV morphine PRN for pain for now (will trend
requirement overnight)
- His OxyContin 20 mg PO TID, ibuprofen 600 mg TID, gabapentin
800 mg TID (home pain regimen) were restarted and he was given
oxycodone prn for breakthrough pain

## Renal function.  Remained at baseline with good urine output.

## GI: no issues

## Heme: On [**2123-2-20**], prior to discharge, the patient developed
bilateral calf tenderness without swelling.  Bilateral lower
extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.

## Disposition: He was seen by physical therapy who deemed him
safe for home.  He was discharged on [**2123-2-20**] with 3 chest tubes
to pneumostat and antibiotics.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in 2 weeks for Chest CT.
