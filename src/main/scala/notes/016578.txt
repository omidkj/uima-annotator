Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  *1.3 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Moderate-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. Bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis (AVR). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. TR present
- cannot be quantified. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. The rhythm appears
to be A-V paced. The patient has runs of a supraventricular
tachycardia. Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow
the patient. Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. A
well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The gradients could not be assessed. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is moderate mitral annular calcification (vs. annuloplasty
ring). Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated aortic valve
bioprosthesis without aortic regurgitation.. Biventricular
cavity enlargement with biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse
process.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-22**],
biventricular systolic function is slightly improved and the
estimated PA systolic pressure is higher.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**12-17**] Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] was admitted for pre-hydration for a planned
cardiac catheterization prior to a planned mitral valve
replacement. He underwent a pre-operative work-up.  His cardiac
catheterization revealed no significant coronary disease.  On
[**2114-12-19**] he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
tissue valve.  This procedure was performed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see the operative note for details.  He
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in critical
but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  He
extubated sucessfully.  On post-operative day three he
experienced rapid atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic
instability.  He was cardioverted unsuccessfully multiple times.
 He also experienced ventricular tachycardia and was
defibrillated sucessfully.  Multiple pressors were required and
an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed to support hemodynamics.
 He developed multi-system organ failur
