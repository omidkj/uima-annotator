PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 102.4, pulse
98, blood pressure 108/57, respiratory rate of 28, O2
saturation 92% on room air.  General:  This is a thin,
tachypneic male in mild distress, able to speak in complete
sentences.  HEENT:  Pupils are round, the right pupil
slightly larger than left.  Sclerae are anicteric.
Conjunctivae uninjected.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck:
There is mild right cervical lymphadenopathy.  No JVD and no
thyromegaly.  Cor:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2,
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:  Rhonchi in the left
lower fields, no egophony, and no wheezing bilaterally.  GI
is soft, nontender, nondistended, plus bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.  Neurological examination:  Right
pupil approximately 3 mm and round.  Left pupil approximately
2 mm and round, both reactive to light.  Cranial nerves
otherwise intact.  Strength 5+ in all fields.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 13.6 with 81%
neutrophils, hematocrit 37.4, platelets of 255.  Sodium of
136, potassium 3.7, chloride 97, bicarb 27, BUN 18,
creatinine 0.7, and glucose 125.  Urinalysis revealed no
white blood cells, no bacteria.

Chest x-ray shows a left lower lung pneumonia persistent
since a film that was obtained on [**2170-10-10**] with slight
interval worsening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient spiked increasing temperatures up
to 105.3, and was noted to have increased difficulty
breathing.  CT of the chest on the [**10-19**] revealed
bilateral pleural effusions with left sided loculated
effusion, worsening of a right sided pleural effusion.
Antibiotics were changed from levofloxacin and Flagyl to
levofloxacin, Flagyl, and clindamycin out of concern for
development of parapneumonic effusion and empyema.  Two chest
tubes were placed on [**10-19**] and [**10-20**], but the patient
nevertheless required transfer to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit on the [**10-20**] for worsening hypoxia.

The patient subsequently required intubation on [**10-21**] for respiratory distress.  Despite placement of the
two chest tubes, patient continued to have collection visible
on CT scan with collapsed lower left lung and was therefore
taken to the operating room for decortication.  The patient
nonetheless required three further chest tube placements to
drain collections of loculated pleural fluid.  Patient was
successfully extubated on [**10-25**], but required subsequent
reintubation on the [**10-26**] for presumed mucus
plugging.

A central right IJ line was placed on the [**10-26**].
Patient underwent bronchoscopy for removal of mucus plug.
Bronchoscopy on the 17th showed mild mucosal erythema and
moderate amounts of clear yellow secretions that were
drained.

Patient was successfully extubated on the [**10-29**].
Culture results were remarkable only for positive pleural
fluids that revealed Streptococcus milleri in pleural fluid
analysis that was collected on the [**10-20**], and also
a blood culture on the [**10-23**] that revealed 1/4
bottles positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans (see ID section below).

Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 139**] service on the [**10-30**] in stable condition.  The patient remained afebrile
from the [**10-27**] onwards.  Subsequent surveillance
chest x-rays revealed a large left sided pleural effusion,
but as the patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs,
the decision was made not to tap the fluid as it was thought
to be a persistent pleural effusion partially due to the
patient's hypoalbuminemia.

2. ID:  Patient was admitted with a left lower lobe pneumonia
with parapneumonic effusion and empyema as detailed above.
He was initially begun on levofloxacin and Flagyl, and was
intermittently treated with Vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Pleural fluid culture on [**10-20**] revealed Streptococcus
milleri, and the patient was also begun on clindamycin 600 mg
IV q.8.

Blood culture on the [**10-23**] revealed 1/4 bottles
that was positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.  Patient initially
begun on amphotericin-B, but later switched to fluconazole
IV.  Ceftazidime was discontinued and the patient was
continued on three week courses of both clindamycin for the
Strep milleri as well as fluconazole for the [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans
fungemia.  Blood cultures were negative throughout his
hospitalization other than for the one positive C. albicans
culture, and culture from the VATS tissue specimen was
negative on the 14th.  Urine cultures were negative
throughout.  Patient will finish out three week courses of
clindamycin as well as fluconazole.

PICC line placement was obtained on the [**11-2**] for
continuation of his IV antibiotics post-discharge.

3. Cardiovascular:  During the patient's MICU course, he was
intermittently hypotensive and required part of his MICU
course, pressor support with Levophed.  Levophed was
successfully weaned.  An echocardiogram was obtained on the
[**10-26**], and revealed a mildly dilated left atrium
with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left
ventricular systolic function with an EF of 70%, normal right
ventricular chamber size and wall motion, no valvular
abnormalities were noted, and there was no vegetation evident
on the echocardiographic study.

4. GI:  The patient was noted to have hepatomegaly.  This was
not felt to be secondary to cardiovascular causes as the
echocardiogram revealed normal cardiac function.  It is not
clear how long the patient has had hepatomegaly, however,
liver function tests were checked on several occasions during
the hospital course, and were found to be within normal
limits.  His total bilirubin ranged between 0.3 and 0.7
during the hospitalization with no transaminitis.
