ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  79-year-old male with CAD, diabetes,
bladder cancer, transferred for management of urosepsis
causing demand ischemia.

1.  CV:  Patient with CAD status post MI.  Patient unaware of
recent echo or evaluation of heart function.  EKG could be
consistent with fixed stenosis.  Hemodynamically stable.  No
chest pain currently, receiving Aspirin.  Cycle CKs, maintain
Heparin per protocol to rule out MI, hold blood pressure
medications in setting of recent hypotension, cardiac echo in
a.m.

2.  Pulmonary:  Mild shortness of breath question secondary
to increased abdominal distention, PE and chest x-ray
negative for CHF.  Has reported history of RAD, no PFTs
recently. Check ABG to evaluate for hypoxia and acid base
status, MDI's prn.

3.  Renal:  Unknown baseline, ARF by outside hospital report.
Patient has a history describing several days of decreased po
intake, decreased urine output, no dysuria or hematuria,
presumably has UTI by urologist.  Likely developed urosepsis
given decreased blood pressure and increased white blood
cells.  Appears to be responding to IV fluid with good urine
output at this time.  Question role of bladder cancer in
causing post obstructive situation.  Check renal ultrasound
to rule out hydronephrosis and also bladder to rule out
obstruction.  Send urine lytes, urinalysis and urine culture.
Check lytes and replete prn.  Check ABG to rule out acid
based problems.

4.  ID:  Urosepsis, no culture data available from outside
hospital.  Send urinalysis, urine culture, blood cultures,
white blood cell count, cover with Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin.

5.  GI:  Patient has complaint of abdominal pain.  Patient is
not passing gas since last night, no bowel movement in five
days, positive distention consistent with ileus given UTI.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have mesenteric ischemia given hypotension.  Check
KUB to evaluate for sepsis/SBO/ileus.  Check ABG.  The
patient will have an NG tube in with IV fluid, check LFTs and
pancreatic enzymes.

6.  Heme:  Patient's hematocrit stable.  Platelets normal.
Check PTT given Heparin.

7.  Endocrine:  Diabetes type 2, patient on Glyburide, blood
sugars currently in 60's, check fingersticks qid, prophylaxis
with Heparin and Protonix.  The patient has a peripheral line
and a Foley catheter.  Patient is a full code.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had E. coli positive urine
resistant to Fluoroquinolones but sensitive to Aztreonam.
Due to Penicillin allergy with 10% Cephalosporin cross
reactivity patient was put on Aztreonam 2 mg IV q 8 hours.
Patient with left ureter obstruction, had successful
placement of left nephrostomy tube to outside drain.  Drain
to stay in until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38494**], urologist, can evaluate for
resolution of obstruction to remove the drain.  Patient's
creatinine then trended down to normal with creatinine on
discharge of 1.5 down from 4.2.  Urine output was good.
Patient had a CVL placed which was working well until removed
prior to discharge.  Patient's outpatient urologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 38494**] is aware of events and will follow.  Patient's urine
culture on discharge was negative.  Patient's blood culture on
[**2174-2-11**] showed E. coli in [**1-24**] bottles and on discharge, blood
cultures were no growth to date.  Stool was negative for C.
diff and fecal leukocytes.  PICC line was placed so he could
continue Aztreonam IV outpatient for a total of 14 days per
ID.  Patient will be sent to rehab for IV antibiotics and
physical therapy.

CV:  Patient with EKG changes, had cardiac catheterization
which showed cardiac output of 7.3, cardiac index of 3.3 with
pressures as follows: Wedge pressure 15, PA pressure 30, RV
pressure 43/14 and RA pressure of 11.  Vessels showed LAD
with 40% mid left circ with 40% and RCA was totally occluded
distally with collaterals.  No intervention was needed.
Medical management of his cardiac disease.  Patient's
Lopressor is at 75 mg tid, Captopril is at 25 mg tid, Zocor
20 mg q d.  Patient's blood pressure is 122/56, heart rate
68, he is stable on discharge.  Patient is afebrile at 98.6.
Patient will follow-up with his primary care doctor, Dr.
[**Last Name (un) **] for blood pressure and med changes as needed.
Patient may need nitrates as outpatient if angina persists.
Patient has sublingual Nitroglycerin for chest pain, no
further episodes in hospital.  Patient's diabetes is
controlled with NPH and sliding scale.  We will monitor his
output. The patient will continue his Protonix and Miconazole
powder as needed.  Patient is cleared to go with PT and use a
walker.  His hematocrit is stable on discharge.  Patient will
need potassium checked.  He will take potassium 40 mEq prn as
needed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 75 mg tid, Captopril 25 mg
tid, Colace, Protonix 40 mg q d, Zocor 20 mg q d, Pyridium
200 mg tid, Aztreonam 2 gm IV q 8 hours, Nystatin swish and
swallow qid, NPH 10 units [**Hospital1 **] and Aspirin 325 mg q d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Urosepsis with resolution, status post nephrostomy tube
left side.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Demand ischemia due to urosepsis.
4.  Bladder cancer and diabetes.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved, stable.  Will follow-up with
outpatient urologist, PCP for blood pressure meds, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] for cardiology .
