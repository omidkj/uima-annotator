History of Present Illness:
Medicine admisison:
84 year old female with AFib (not on Coumadin), recently
increased falls, HTN, and Sjogren's syndrome, who presents with
fever. Initial vitals in the ED were T 98.6, HR 83, BP 117/60,
RR 18, and SpO2 93% on RA. In the ED, she was confused, oriented
only to person, and a poor historian. Labs were notable for
hyponatremia, mildly elevated LFTs, LDH 1383, and WBC 19.6. Her
urine was dark brown with WBC 94 and few bacteria. Repeat UA
showed WBC >182 with clumps. Portable CXR showed a possible
pneumonia. Her initial lactate was 3.4, but improved to 2.0 with
IV fluids (normal saline [**2094**] ml). Cardiac enzymes were
negative. She was given Levofloxacin 500 mg IV, Ceftriaxone 1000
mg IV, and Tylenol 650 mg PR. Repeat labs showed continued mild
hyponatremia with Na 133, bicarb 29, and AG 5. She was admitted
to Medicine for further management. Vitals prior to transfer
were T 100.2, HR 94, BP 148/76, RR 22, and SpO2 97% on RA. On

Code stroke:
84 year-old
woman with Afib, not on Coumadin secondary to falls, HTN and
vascular dementia who originally presented with delirium in the
setting of a PNA, was last seen well at 5 PM this evening when
she was found in her chair about an hour later, unresponsive,
with right facial and left extremity weakness. A code stroke was
called.

The patient initially presented with fever and delirium from her
[**Hospital3 **] environment. She was found to have a PNA and
treated with Vanco and cefepime. Her delirium has shown mild
improvement, but she has remained generally agitated and
disgruntle, not wanting to follow commands.

On arrival to the code stroke the team expressed that although
she does have minor right facial weakness, this is much worse
with a full ptosis. Her left UE has had some strength, but the
team's testing has been limited by a shoulder injury s/p a fall.

She was not speaking and had a decreased level of consciousness.


She has been off Coumadin for the last few months secondary to
multiple falls.
