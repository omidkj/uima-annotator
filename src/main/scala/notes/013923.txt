History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6357**] is an 88 year old woman with a past medical history
significant for breast cancer, dementia (unknown etiology),
coronary artery disease,chronic anemia, atrial fibrillation, and
congestive heart failure who presented on [**2163-8-15**] with nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain and increased confusion at her nursing
home. In the ED, she had a fever to 104.8, blood pressure 63/37,
wbc 40, and was given vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone per the MUST
protocol. For hemodynamic instability, the patient was
transferred to the MICU and required pressors for a period of
time (levophed until [**8-17**], Dobutamine until [**8-18**], and Xigres
until [**8-19**]) and had a nasogastric tube endoscopically placed due
to hiatal hernia. She was found to have sepsis from a urinary
source with 4/4 sets of blood cultures and urine culture
positive for E.coli. She was started on IV ceftriaxone in the
MICU. Chest x ray at the time was negative. She did not receive
the Sinemet for her Parkinson's while in the MICU and was
increasingly rigid while there.

[**2163-8-29**] Head CT w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect. Please note that MRI/MRA with
diffusion weighted imaging would be more sensitive in evaluating
for early infarction.

[**2163-8-25**] Right Upper Extremity Venous Doppler U/S: No right upper
extremity venous thrombosis.

[**2163-8-16**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>50%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate
([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There
is a moderate
sized pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.  Compared with the
findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review)of [**2153-7-6**], mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are now evident.

[**2163-8-15**] Abdominal CT W/WO contrast: 1) Large pericardial
effusion. 2) Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6357**] is an 88 year old female with history of
Parkinson's disease and associated dementia, also CHF, breast
cancer, atrial fibrillation, who presented to the MICU where she
was treated for urosepsis. She has history of dysphagia and
aspiration risk requiring nectar thickened liquids at her
nursing home and had worsened dysphagia this admission with
likely aspiration pneumonia. Her mental status and dysphagia
have improved over the hospital course as the patient's
infection resolved and she was restarted on medical therapy for
Parkinson's disease.  At discharge, she has no signs or symptoms
of infection and appears to be at baseline mental status and
swallowing ability of nectar thickened liquids is intact.

Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient developed a low grade
temperature and leukocytosis that was likely the result of
aspiration pneumonia in setting of tube feedings.  The patient
has been afebrile without increased WBCs for several days and
has one day left on a course of flagyl 250mg daily.  Aspiration
precautions and careful feeding per recommendations may help
prevent future aspiration.  The head of the bed should remain
elevated above 30 degrees at all times. Because the patient's
swallowing function is compromised, she is at risk for repeat
aspiration.

Urosepsis: Urine and blood cultures 8/23 were positive for
pan-sensitive E.coli and Proteus that was resistant to
ampicillin. The patient completed a two week course of IV
ceftriaxone. Surveillance urine and blood cultures have
subsequently been negative.  Avoiding Foley catheter use is
recommended if possible to decrease risk of future urinary tract
infec
