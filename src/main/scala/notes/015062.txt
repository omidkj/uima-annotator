Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status/Delirium

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
81 y/o male with CAD, sCHF and dCHF (EF 45-50%), pacemaker, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.4), AF (on coumadin), hx stroke (no residual
weakness), COPD/emphysema (not on home O2), who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] facility to the ED after what appears to be an
unwitnessed mechanical fall with acute agitation.
.
He was supposed to be admitted to [**Location (un) 620**] for CHF, fluid
overload, as his breathing is worse over last 2 days. However,
he got up and fell, with + head strike. EMS diverted from
[**Location (un) 620**] due to AMS en route.
.
Of note, per discussion with daughter, pt has had progressive
SOB over months. His lasix and zaroxylyn have been titrated by
cardiology. He was last noted to be conversant and in good
spirits yesterday. Of note, he was noted to have "jerking
movements" by his RN at [**Hospital3 **]. She reports that he has
been drinking wine and bloody [**Doctor First Name **] at the rehab "over the past
few days." When gathering additional collateral information,
daughter reports that pt was encouraged to seek psychiatry help
as he has had "outbursts" in the past but never directed at
other people.
.
Initial ED vitals - not provided. Exam: somnolent, arouses to
voice but does not follow simple commands. Laceration left
posterior scalp. Labs: Cr 3.8 (baseline 2.4). FAST: trace
pericardial effusion, otherwise negative. Pt given lasix 20 mg
IV. Pt underwent lac repair with 4 staples. Tetanus given in ED.
Pt also underwent x-rays left shin due to bruise, pending at
this time.
.
Neuro consulted: Neurological examiantion shows classic textbook
metabolic encephalopathy with diffuse myoclonic jerks as well as
asterixis. This is diagnostic of metabolic encephalopthy, such
as acute on chronic renal failure in this patient. (Cr of 3.8,
baseline 2 to 2.2). The differential would be seizure, which is
unlikely given well conversant behaviour during the classic
myoclonic jerks. No further neurological work up indicated at
this point.
