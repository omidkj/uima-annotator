Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 82858**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service
on [**2119-8-22**] and taken to the Operating Room for L1
vertebrectomy with a staged anterior and posterior
stabilization.
She was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolis on CT scan and a
filter was placed prior to taking her for her spine
stabilization.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was
transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots
were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous
antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop
pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#3 ([**2119-8-24**]) she returned
to the operating room for posterior stabilization. Please refer
to the dictated operative note for further details. The second
surgery was also without complication and the patient was
transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. A bupivicaine
epidural pain catheter placed at the time of the posterior
surgery remained in place until postop day one.  She was kept
NPO until bowel function returned then diet was advanced as
tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication
when tolerating PO diet. Her hematocrit was noticed to be low
and she was transfused 2 units PRBCs.  Foley was removed on
POD#3 from the second procedure. She was fitted with a TLSO
brace to be used while ambulating. Physical therapy was
consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital course was
otherwise unremarkable. On the day of discharge the patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain
control and tolerating a regular diet.
