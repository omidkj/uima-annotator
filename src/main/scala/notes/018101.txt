History of Present Illness:
72F with history of rheumatoid arthritis on steroids presents
with severe abdominal pain of one day duration. Patient reports
long standing trouble with gastric ulcers due to her
immunosuppressive therapy, however her medication was stopped
due to intolerance. She had not had episodes of abdominal pain
in the past. Her current pain is not accompanied by nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea. She has not been passing flatus since her
pain started. She has normal bowel movements and reports a
normal recent colonoscopy. She denies fevers, chills, and
malaise. Her main health problems at this time are related to
her RA which is severe and has recently required citoxan therapy
for which a tunneled L SCV line was placed about 6 weeks ago.
Her last dose of citoxan was 5 weeks ago. She was recently
admitted at [**Hospital3 **] for management of MRSA cellulitis
from her chronic vasculitic LE leg wounds. At outside hospital,
received meropenem and flagyl. Of note, her plavix has been held
for the last 4 days.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an OSH after an Abd CT scan
revealed free air and fluid within her pelvis without a clear
source of perforation.  She was initially admitted to the trauma
ICU, but was taken emergently to the operating room on [**11-14**], [**2130**] where she underwent a Hartmann's resection of the
sigmoid colon and end colostomy with Hartmann's pouch; please
see operative report for further details.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the ICU.  She
was extubated and transitionted to IV dilaudid for pain control
with continued intravenous metronidazole and meropenem.  Her NGT
was discontinued and po medications were initiated.  Given
hemodynamic stability, she was transferred to the general
surgical [**Hospital1 **] on [**Month (only) 359**] POD2 for further management.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout her
hospitalization; post-extubation, pain was initially managed
with intravenous hydromorphone.  This was transitioned to oral
oxycodone and acetaminophen on POD5 with well controlled pain.
Of note, the patient did occasionally require intravenous
morphine for breakthrough pain control.
CV: Upon transfer from the OSH, the patient was noted to be in a
fib with intermittent RVR.  Oral metoprolol was resumed on POD1
and a cardiology consult was obtained on POD4 with
recommendations for anticoagulation with either heparin gtt or
lovenox bridged to oral warfarin or to begin anticoagulation
with dabigatran.  [**Month (only) 4692**], possible cardioversion either as
an in/outpatient was suggested; anticoagulation not resumed at
this time as per surgeon due to very high risk for falls.  The
patient remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable,
therefore, inpatient cardioversion was not attempted.  She will
follow-up with her primary care provider upon discharge for
ongoing management of these issues. She was not started on
anticoagulation, outside of subcutaneous heparin, because of
fall risk and the thought that her irregular heart rate was a
post-surgical response. This will be reassessed when she follows
up in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic and with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 4692**], the patient
presented with a tunneled line in place for outpatient citoxan,
which was noted to be out of position on POD2, requiring IR
removal and replacement. Pulmonary:   The patient remained
intubated post-operatively due to difficulty with initial
intubation for surgery.  Given respiratory stability she was
extubated on POD1.  She remained stable until POD6 when she
developed acute SOB.  A CXR was obtained and suggested
'unchanged left lower lung collapse and improved bilateral
pleural effusions'. The event did not recur and the patient
remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization;
vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout hospitalization. Patient has history of diastolic
heart failure, chronic, that was monitored throughout this
hospitalization and she ahd no acute issues realted to her heart
failure.
GI/GU/FEN:  Bowel function returned by POD3 as noted by gas/
stool within the ostomy appliance.  The patient received
teaching regarding ostomy care including emptying pouch and
changing the appliance from the Ostomy RN.  However, her ability
to perform these tasks was limited by her hand deformities.
Occupational therapy was consulted for further assistance and
will continue at the rehab facility.  She was initially NPO, but
was advanced sequentially following return of bowel function to
diabetic diet, which was well tolerated. Nutrition was consulted
due to multiple bilateral chronic lower extremity ulcerations;
recommendations included high protein supplements and food
choices.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored
with electrolyte repletion prn. She was taking adequate food and
had gppd output through her ostomy.
ID: Intravenous metronidazole and meropenem were initiated and
continued through POD2 & POD7, respectively. On POD 7, the
patient's WBC began trending upward, therefore, blood cultures
were sent and an CT Torso was obtained and her antibiotics were
switched to vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole; results from CT
scan showed small amount of free fluid in the pelvis but no
signs of abscess and otherwise normal CT.  On POD 8, the WBC
began trending downward and on POD 9 patient was kept on only
diflucan with a planned 5 day course for what appeared per derm
and rheum to be a yeast infection on her back. She was
discharged on no antibioics as she had finished her course of
diflucan and her back rash was much improved. At time of
discharge her blood cultures had no grow
