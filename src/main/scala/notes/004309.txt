IMAGING:
[**2-16**] CT head: Stable multicompartmental intracranial hemorrhage
including small globus pallidus and medial temporal lobe
intraparenchymal hemorrhage and minimal hemorrhage in occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left lateral ventricle. A tiny focus of hemorrhage may
not be visualized in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle suggestive of redistribution. No new hemorrhage or
shift in midline structures. Right parietal subgaleal hematoma
with associated laceration and staples overlying.
.
[**2-18**] LENIs: no evidence of DVT in b/l LE
.
[**2-19**] CXR: Low lung volumes persist. Bibasilar atelectasis larger
on the left are unchanged. Lines and tubes are in standard
position. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Left
subcutaneous emphysema has improved.
.
[**2-21**] Abd CT: No evidence of infection in chest, abdomen, and
pelvis, to account for the patient's fever. The study is not
tailored for evaluation of pulmonary embolism; however, within
this limitation, filling defects in left lower lobar and
segmental arteries, is concerning for pulmonary embolus.
Extensive thoracic and abdominal pelvic fractures, with interval
fixation of pelvic fractures in near anatomic alignment. New
mild widening of the right sacroiliac joint. Known right renal
lacerations, with mild interval decrease in the hematoma in the
perinephric space. Stable high-density fluid layering in the
right paracolic gutter and anterior pelvis. No new interval
intra-abdominal or pelvic bleed.
.
[**2-23**] Chest PTA r/o PE: Intraluminal filling defects c/w
pulmonary emboli are visualized in distal left lower lobe
pulmonary artery and extend into anteromedial, lateral and
posterior basal segmental pulmonary arteries. No evidence of
right heart strain.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27003**] was noted to have lost pulses in the ambulance on
arrival to the ED.  He was intubated in the field.  He was
actively coded while bilateral chest tubes were placed, a Cordis
was placed in his right groin and a central line was placed in
his left subclavian.  He regained pulses before losing them
approximately 10 minutes later, and was coded for an additional
amount of time prior to regaining his pulses and remaining
stable thereafter with several units of blood and crystalloid
being infused.  His FAST was negative and he was noted to have
an open fracture of his right distal humerus as well as pelvic
instability. There was concern for urethral injury and a
catheter was not placed at this time.  Given persistent
hemodynamic instability he was sent to the Angio suite with
interventional radiology where they embolized the bilateral
internal iliacs with Gelfoam.  They also performed a retrograde
urethrogram at this time which demonstrated an intact urethra
and placed a Foley catheter at this time.

Between the ED and IR, he received 9 units of PRBCs, 4 units of
blood and 4 L of crystalloid.  He returned to the Trauma ICU
stable not on pressors, but intubated and sedated.  Stable, he
was taken to radiology for further radiologic workup revealing
the following injuries:

Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage basal ganglia
Posterior scalp laceration
Right parietal subgaleal hematoma
Right distal humerus and olecranon fractures
Right renal lacerations with subcapsular hematoma
Right posterior 11th rib fracture
L2-4 transverse process fracture
Right iliac crest fracture
Bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures
Left SI joint diastasis

He was taken to the or on [**2139-2-16**] by the orthopedic team for
ORIF right hip/acetabular fracture as well as I&D and ex-fix of
his right elbow.  He returned to the OR on [**2-18**] for another
washout of his elbow with ORIF and concomitantly had an IVC
filter placed.

His hospital course by systems as follows:

Neuro: Neurosurgery was consulted early on due to his brain
injuries - seizure prophylaxis was started, serial exams and
head CT scans were followed as well. His repeat head scans
remained stable. He was kept intubated and sedated through his
initial days in the TSICU.  His sedation was weaned for
extubation on [**2-19**] and he was treated with IV Dilaudid for pain
control.  He was mildly confused after extubation.  Given his
altered mental status his cervical-collar was not able to be
cleared at first. As his mental status improved we were able to
obtain an adequate physical exam and removed the cervical
collar.

At time of discharge he is awake and answers questions and
follows commands. He was started on Trazodone at HS to help
regulate his sleep/wake cycle given his brain injury and this
has seemed to help.

CV: After initial hemodynamic instability, he stabilized and
remained stable throughout his hospital course.  His Hcts were
trended and stable. He was initially tachycardic after
extubation and intermittently after transfer out of the ICU
remained tachycardiac. He was stated on beta blockers which has
brought his heart into the 80's-90's range.

Resp: Initially placed chest tubes were removed on [**2-17**] (right
side) and [**2-18**] (left) without complication.  He had no pneumo or
hemothorax.  He was extubated on [**2-19**].  After transfer to the
floor on [**2-20**] he was transferred back to the ICU on [**2-21**] for
respiratory distress and for a fever. CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
did not reveal an obvious source of fever but he was placed in
the ICU, antibiotics were broadened and he recovered well.  On
re-review, radiology could not exclude a pulmonary embolism in
the left lower lobe.  This was followed with a CTA on [**2-23**] which
confirmed this finding in the left lower lobe basilar segments
and he was started on a heparin drip. He was transitioned to
Coumadin; his dose was held on [**3-3**] for INR 4.1 after having
received 5mg the night before. We are recommending that he be
given 2.5 mg on [**3-4**] for INR 2.4 repeating INR on [**3-5**].

GI: Initially started on tube feeds via OGT then advanced to a
regular for which he is tolerating much better now with improved
mental status.

GU: His Foley catheter was found to be placed in the urethra
with balloon expansion in the urethra on MRI after Foley
placement in IR.  The catheter was advanced.  He was also noted
to have a right sided renal laceration and subcapsular hematoma.
 Urology was following for both of these issues and recommended
conservative management wit keeping Foley in place for 3-4 weeks
and repeating urethrogram at the end of that time. He will
follow up in [**Hospital 159**] clinic as an outpatient.
