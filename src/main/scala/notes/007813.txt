HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year-old
gentleman status post left thalamic deep brain stimulator
placement on [**2193-10-15**].  Now presenting with worsening
mental status in the setting of a worsening subdural
hematoma.  The patient initially was at a nursing home where
he was found to be less responsive and unable to walk with
his walker for over 24 hours.  He has a history of multiple
falls with subdural hematoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, benign prostatic
hypertrophy, degenerative joint disease, Parkinson's disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Sinemet, Lisinopril and Tylenol.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.6,
hematocrit 40.3, platelets 142, sodium 138, K 4.3, chloride
103, CO2 24, BUN 10, creatinine .6, glucose 113, INR 1.1.
Head CT shows left subdural hematoma.  MRI from [**10-16**] shows
left convexity subdural hematoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neurological Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.  On
physical examination the patient is awake.  Mental status
alert, oriented to person.  Follows commands intermittently.
Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  No drift.  Not
cooperative with individual muscle testing.  Decreased bulk.
Sensation intact to pain.  The patient had bedside drainage
of the subdural hematoma on [**2193-11-28**].  Mental status wise
he was awake and alert, following commands, much brighter,
oriented to person with no drift.  On [**11-30**] the patient had a
repeat head CT, which showed persistent subdural hematoma.
Drain was discontinued and the patient was transferred to the
regular floor.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 19941**] assessment of the scan was
that the patient would need drainage of subdural hematoma in
the Operating Room.  The patient was prepped for the
Operating Room and on [**2193-12-3**] had a left craniotomy for
drainage of a subdural hematoma.  Postoperative the patient
was monitored in the Recovery Room overnight.  He had no
verbal output.  Minimally followed commands, intermittently
held up his left arm, localized to pain in the right upper
extremity, withdrew his lower extremities.  He was therefore
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring
on postoperative day number one.

From [**2193-11-28**] the patient grew out E-coli in his urine.  He
was started on Ampicillin.  On [**2193-12-5**] the patient is
awake, but minimally opens his eyes, follows simple commands,
oriented to self.  Left arm antigravity, withdraw bilateral
lower extremities and purposeful movement of the left upper
extremity.  On [**12-5**] the patient had a repeat head CT, which
showed the drain in good placement with the subdural hematoma
collection somewhat smaller.  The patient was continued to
have the drain in place.  On [**2193-12-7**] the patient was alert,
opens eyes to stimulation, following commands, moving all
extremities spontaneously.  Right drift improved.  Held arms
off the bed.  Withdrew bilateral lower extremities.  Subdural
drain was removed and the patient was transferred to the
regular floor.  On [**2193-12-10**] the patient had an episode of
ventricular tachycardia, which lasted about fifteen minutes
and resolved spontaneously without treatment.  The patient
was seen by cardiology, enzymes were cycled.  Review of
electrocardiogram showed question of flipped T waves in the
lateral leads.  The patient is seen by the EPS Service.
Electrocardiogram shows old right bundle branch block with
inferior Qs and ST elevation.  Enzymes were negative.  They
recommended getting an electrocardiogram and starting the
patient on a beta blocker.

On [**12-12**] the patient was awake, alert, attempting to speak,
following commands, holding up his arms left greater then
right.  On Vancomycin and Levo for MRSA in his sputum.  No
further cardiac issues.  The patient is seen by physical
therapy and occupational therapy and found to require rehab.
The patient also had PEG placement on [**2193-12-16**] without
complications.  Vital signs have been stable.  The patient
has been afebrile and neurologically stable and ready for
transfer to rehab.
