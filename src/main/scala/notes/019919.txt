History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85439**] is a 65 year old man with a PMHx s/f sCHF (EF 25%),
and AF who initially presented to [**Hospital 20338**] Hospital in [**State 108**] on
[**2157-2-7**] with five days of gradually worsening weakness,
dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, decreased appetite. He declines
any dietary or medication nonadherance. Initially he declined
any change in weight. Whilst in [**Location (un) 20338**], he was treated for a CHF
exacerbation with diuresis and milrinone. Over the course of his
first week, he became increasingly hypotensive requiring
increasing doses of milrinone. On [**2-13**] following a fall with near
syncope while walking, Mr. [**Known lastname 85439**] was found to be hypotensive
to SBPs in the 50s requiring transfer to the CCU. Note his only
injury suffered with this fall was an excoriation of his left
knee. He was maintained on dopamine and milrinone early in his
ICU course, but this was able to be weaned on [**2-14**]. LE US
demonstrated no DVT. Throughout his course, when BP would allow
he was gently diuresed with IV boluses of bumex (2mg) and
torsemide (10-20mg), but given his low BP this occurred only
every other day.

Troponin I peaked at 0.27 on [**2-14**].12 on transfer. MB remained
flat throughout his admission. Ischemic etiology was not
entertained.

Echo was performed on [**2157-2-10**] demonstrated EF 22%, severe RV
dysfunction, dilated LA, moderate to severe MR.

Initial CXR demonstrated RML and LLL pneumonia with bilateral
pleural effusions, but CT at the OSH demonstrated large b/l
pleural effusions, several rib fractures on the right, with no
evidence of pneumonia. Of note, he was afebrile throughout his
admission without leukocytosis.

Labs on day of transfer: Na 128, K 3.5, Cl 86, Bicarb 30, BUN
62, Cr 1.9. MG 2.3, Ca 8.6, PT 16.3, INR 1.7.

Also of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 85439**] was initiated on megace for poor
appetite and cachexia.

Social History:
Retired pipe fitter. Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 392**]. Never

Pertinent Studies:
Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic tricuspid
valve is present. The tricuspid prosthesis appears well seated,
with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-1-11**], LV
systolic function appears slightly less vigorous.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2-17**]:
1. Hemodynamic catheterization in this patient demonstrates
decreased
cardiac output at baseline with moderately elevated left
ventricular
filling pressures. Following milrinone infusion the cardiac
index
signficantly increased from 2.1 to 2.5 L/min/m2 without a change
in left
ventricular filling pressures.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
2. Significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters following
milrinone
infusion.

TTE [**2-18**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic tricuspid
valve is present. The tricuspid prosthesis appears well seated,
with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. The
