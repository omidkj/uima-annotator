Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
75F w/ 5.0 cm AAA, ? aortitis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endovascular stent graft repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm with complicated repair of left femoral artery
including endarterectomy and bovine patch.


History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 75 y.o elderly female who presents with a
greater than 2 cm increase in the size of her infrarenal aortic
aneurysm over a 6-week period. The AAA is now 5 cm. This was
inthe context of a gallstone pancreatitis in the past. She had
no clinical signs of infection with a normal white count and no
fever but there was concern that this may be progression of an
inflammatory aneurysm. In addition, repair andresection of
aorta, given her current state of health, would not be
reasonable. Thus, it was decided to perform an endovascular
repair and treat her with antibiotics and close follow-up.

75 aaa sp endovascular stent. folow up evaluate for leack.

CT ANGIOGRAM: Lower thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and
mildly atheromatous.

The upper abdominal aorta is normal in caliber measuring 2.1 cm
at the origin of the SMA and 2.3 cm at the level of the renal
artery origins. The celiac, SMA arteries are patent. There has
been interval endostent repair of the infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm extending from just below the level of the renal
artery origins to both common iliac arteries. The distal
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm sac is mildly smaller in
the interval measuring up to a maximal diameter of 4.6 cm
transverse x 3.6 cm AP. No retroperitoneal or acute periaortic
hematoma. There is a minor (subcentimeter) tissue rim along the
anterior left lateral aspect of the aneurysm sac, which has
shown some interval regression compared to previous CT of [**2178-10-26**]. There is also minor thickening along the region of
the [**Female First Name (un) 899**], which shows antegrade filling.

There is evidence of a small endo leak within the aneuryssm sac
with a curvilinear leak of contrast outside the stent within the
right posterior lateral aspect of the distal infrarenal
abdominal aorta just inferior to the bifurcation of the stent
into the iliac limbs (series 4, image 92) and posterior to the
iliac limb components (series 6 image 45) where there is nearby
filling of the L3 lumber arteries.There is subtle(1cm) area of
hyperdensity in the anterior of the aneurysm sac below the level
of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] (which is patent with antregrade filling) that could
also be related to a small likley Type 2 endoleak(series 4 image
119).

The volume of the infrarenal abdominal aorta from the renal
artery to iliac bifurcation is small than previous( estimated at
110 cc to the aortic bifurcation and 123cc to iliac bifurcation
compared to 142 and 130 on the previous CT of [**2178-10-26**]).

Both common and external iliac arteries are patent and normal in
caliber. Diffuse calcified and uncalcified plaque along the
iliac systems with an area of focal uncalcified plaque in the
proximal portion of the left common iliac artery (series 4 image
for 147) and chronic occlusion of the left internal iliac
artery. Both common femoral and included portion of the proximal
SFA profunda femoral arteries are patent.

CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
Coronary artery calcification and annular calcification of the
mitral valve noted. Minor atelectasis in the dependent portion
of the left lower lobe and a small right and left basal pleural
effusion.

The liver, spleen, both adrenal glands, pancreas are normal.
Subcentimeter calcified gallstone in the dependent portion of
the nondistended gallbladder body.

Both kidneys are normal in size and show symmetric post-contrast
enhancement.

CT SCAN OF PELVIS:
Ovoid lesion in the mid inferior pelvis located superior to the
bladder dome. This is well rounded, essentially hypodense and is
unchanged compared to CT of [**2175-3-23**].

Urinary catheter within the bladder, which is empty at time of
scanning.

Mild diverticulosis noted along the lower left and upper sigmoid
colon.

Several subcentimeter areas of induration in the subcutaneous
tissues in the right and left lower abdomen, likely related to
subcutaneous injections. Surgical clips noted in the right and
left groin, no adjacent collections.

No concerning bone lesions demonstrated on bone windows setting.
Degenerative disk space narrowing in the lower lumber vertebra
and moderate degenerative change in both hip joint spaces.
Generalized reduction in bone mineral density noted due to
osteoporotic change.

CONCLUSION:

1. The aneurysm sac has shown some interval reduction in size
following endostent placement as described.

2. Minor early probably Type 2 endoleak with antrgrage filling
of
