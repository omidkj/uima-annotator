Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) [**2172-2-7**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10594**] is a 73 yo F with hx of recurrent gastric cancer with
recently seen oozing on upper endoscopy (see EGD report/images
[**12/2171**]), who presents with 4 days of SOB and lightheadedness.
She was feeling fairly well, with intermittent fatigue,
shortness of breath, which became progressively worse 4 days
ago. Since about a month ago, she has been having intermittent
lightheadedness, weakness and increased shortness of breath. In
the last week, she has only been able to walk a few steps before
becoming short of breath. She had her blood pressure checked at
a local pharmacy and found it to be 90/50, which prompted and
appointment with her outpatient provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] denies any black
stools, bloody stools, or hematemsis. She was seen as an
outpatient today. At that appointment, per OMR, she was noted to
have an irregular rhythm thought to be afib with no ischemic
changes. She was referred to the ED for further evaluation.

She says that she has otherwise been feeling well recently, and
denies fevers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.
She also denies any chest pain. She says she has a large
appetite, but can only eat small meals.

In the ED, initial VS were:  99.0 103 139/59 20 100%. On exam
she was noted to have brown stool, guaiac positive, no melena.
Pt awake, alert, hemodynamically stable. Labs notable for Hct
15.1 from 36. WBC 3.1 with 73% PMN's and no bands. No coags sent
yet. ECG shows sinus rate 99 NANI, no ST changes. CXR showed no
acute process per prelim read. GI consulted from the ED, and
think likely slow bleed with plan to scope in the AM. She was
given Protonix 40mg IV x1. She was also given 500cc NS of the 1L
ordered. She has not received blood yet but 2 units ordered, but
have not yet arrived. For access she has 2 PIV's 18g and 20g. VS
prior to transfer 120/64 91 18 100% 3LNC (likely does not
require 3L but felt SOB).

On arrival to the MICU, her VS are T 98.2 BP 132/67 HR 99 RR 13
O2 sat 100%. She says she feels well now, but will become short
of breath or lightheaded with any movement.

She says that since the diagnosis of her recent gastric
carcinoma, she has been in discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] and her
previous surgeons Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**]. Per the pt, a meeting was held,
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] thinks repeat surgery would be risky. She is
scheduled to have a second opinion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10595**] at [**Hospital 10596**]. She says that if surgery is not an option, they are
considering further chemoradiation. Her last chemotherapy was in
[**2171-2-12**].

IMAGING:
CXR [**2172-2-6**]: PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to
previous exam from [**2170-10-11**]. Subtle opacity is noted at
the left lung base which may represent atelectasis versus early
pneumonia. Posterior costophrenic angles are sharp. Elsewhere,
the lungs are clear noting minimal biapical scarring. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous
and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

EGD [**2172-2-7**]:
-Esophagus:
Mucosa: Erythema was seen at the GE junction consistent with
esophagitis.
-Stomach:
 Mucosa: erythema and petechia were noted in the funus and
cardia of the stomach. There was contact bleeding but no single
clear place to intervene upon and the abnormalities were
diffuse. The GJ anastamosis site was without ulceration or
breakdown, although there was some congestion in the area of
cancer recurrence.
-Duodenum: Normal duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
73F with history of recurrent gastric cancer, who presented with
fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness in setting of 21 point
drop in Hct, likely secondary to slow upper GI bleeding in
setting of known gastric cancer with EGD this admission showing
diffuse contact bleeding of gastritis.

# Iron deficiency anema/upper GI bleeding: Patient presented
with symptomatic anemia and Hct 15.1, with guiac positive stool.
 Her labs were suggestive of iron defiency anemia, with iron
level 9 and ferritin
