HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 85-year-old male with a
history of COPD, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive
heart failure, previous CVA, atrial fibrillation, dementia,
and a recently diagnosed Pseudomonas urinary tract infection,
who presented to [**Hospital6 4620**] on [**6-12**] after
being found down on the ground at home by his daughter.  The
patient lives at home with his wife, who has been bed bound
recently secondary to a pelvic fracture.

He reportedly has a baseline dementia with difficulty
articulating words, according to his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] reportedly
had change in his baseline function over the past two weeks
prior to his fall.  There was no evidence of physical trauma.
The patient was brought to [**Hospital6 4620**], where
he reportedly had chest x-ray, C spine films, and pelvic
films that did not show any fracture or any infiltrates.  He
also reportedly had a head CT that showed no hemorrhage,
hydrocephalus, or mass effect, and there were bilateral
thalamic lacunar infarcts with a question of a new left
thalamic infarct.

At the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 4620**], the
patient had an ABG performed that had a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of
70, and a pAO2 of 61.  This appears to be the patient's
baseline ABG from previous discharge summary from [**Hospital6 4874**], however, in the Emergency Department at
[**Hospital3 **], he was started on BiPAP and the family was
told that he would need to be transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] Intensive Care Unit for BiPAP.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**],
where he had a chest x-ray in the Emergency Department, which
did not show any infiltrate.  He was started on BiPAP and
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

hired a home health worker six hours a day.  Patient is
apparently is able to do some of his activities of daily
living.

Stage II to III sacral and bilateral buttock decubitus ulcer
without evidence of infection.  Extremities:  1 plus

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 10.2
with a differential of 77 polys, 11 percent lymphocytes,
hematocrit 36.1, platelets 416.  Chem-7:  Sodium of 147,

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the
Emergency Department to the Intensive Care Unit on BiPAP.  On
arrival, his oxygen saturation was 100 percent peripherally.
His ABG had a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 76, and a pAO2 of 123.  The
patient's pCO2 had worsened with the increased oxygen
provided with BiPAP en route.  The BiPAP was discontinued,
and the patient's arterial blood gas several hours later on 2
liters of oxygen had improved to close to his baseline blood
gas with a pH of 7.28, pCO2 of 70, and a pAO2 of 56.

The patient was maintained on 2 liters of oxygen with a goal
peripheral oxygen saturation of 88 percent to 92 percent as
he has a chronic respiratory acidosis from his COPD with CO2
retention and a baseline CO2 of 60-70.  He also has a
baseline elevation of his bicarbonate with a bicarbonate in
the low 30s.

The patient has not been on chronic oxygen at home.  He may
benefit from very low flow oxygen.  However, his oxygen
saturation is in the high 80s to low 90s on room air, he may
not need continuous home O2.  It was felt that his
respiratory acidosis was chronic.  He was not unchanged from
his baseline and that his chronic stable respiratory acidosis
did not account for his fall or altered mental status.

The etiology of his altered mental status is unclear.  The
patient certainly has a component of progressive vascular
dementia, but may have a component of Alzheimer's dementia as
well.  He has also recently been diagnosed with a urinary
tract infection.  He was initially on ciprofloxacin, however,
on arrival culture and sensitivity data was not available,
and he was given a dose of meropenum for possible Pseudomonas
that was resistant to ciprofloxacin.  However, the following
morning the sensitivity data was obtained, and it revealed
intermediate sensitivity to ciprofloxacin.  Given the urinary
tract source and high concentration of ciprofloxacin within
the urine, it was felt that a course of ciprofloxacin for two
weeks for a complicated urinary tract infection in this
elderly male would be adequate to cover his Pseudomonal
urinary tract infection.

Other possible etiologies for his altered mental status
included new stroke given the possible finding of a new
lacunar infarct on his head CT at [**Hospital6 4620**].
The patient was continued on his baby aspirin and [**Name (NI) **].  It
was felt that a MRI was not indicated as it would not change
management at this time.  The patient had normal B12 and
folate levels, a normal TSH, normal digoxin level, and a
negative RPR.  His EKG did not show any ischemic changes and
showed only A-paced rhythm with a right bundle branch block.

It is likely that this patient's failure to thrive and recent
mental status changes represents progression of his end-stage
dementia along with his urinary tract infection and possible
new stroke.

The patient has baseline renal failure with a creatinine,
which appears to be approximately 2.5 on admission.  His
creatinine was 2.9 on  the transfer to [**Hospital6 27253**].  His creatinine had remained stable at 2.8.

The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and was on
NPH as well as sliding scale insulin, however, on admission
to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a fingerstick
blood glucose that was 48.  At this time, he was also
slightly lethargic.  He was given 1.5 and an amp of D50 and
his mental status improved slightly, therefore, his NPH doses
were discontinued.  He was followed with fingersticks to
check his blood sugars, and he was given regular insulin
based on a sliding scale.

Sacral decubitus ulcer:  The patient has Stage II to III
sacral an
