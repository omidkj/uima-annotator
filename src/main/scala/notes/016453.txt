Chief Complaint:
failure to extubate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Internal Cardiac Defibrillator Implantation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] is a 24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25%
in [**9-28**]) who was admitted for right heart cardiac catherization
and AICD placement today. He is being transferred to the CCU
after difficulty with extubation s/p cath. Patient was recently
admitted to the CCU from [**2192-12-23**] - [**2192-12-26**] with acute congestive
heart failure in the setting of dietary non-compliance. He was
scheduled to have his AICD placed today under general anesthesia
per recommendation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Per anesthesia, patient was a
difficult intubation due to his body habitus, and was maintained
on a phenylephrine gtt in order to maintain his blood pressures
during the procedure (SBPs in 100s-120s). He underwent RHC which
showed elevated wedge, PA, RV, and RA pressures (see
hemodynamics below). He had a [**Company 2267**] single chamber
ICD placed through cutdown of left cephalic vein without
complication. Received 1.2 L of LR in the OR. He was continued
on a neo gtt which was weaned at 5 pm, and remained off pressors
for 4 hours prior to CCU transfer. Patient was transitioned to
PS [**9-29**] in an attempt at extubation in the PACU, but these
attempts were unsuccessful due to tachypnea and secretions
requring continuous secretions. Patient was also noted to be
difficult to sedate during ventilation and was maintained on
propofol 70 mcg/kg/min. A-lines attempts in both radial arteries
by anesthesia were unsuccessful. It was thought that the failure
to extubate was due to body habitus and pulmonary edema. Prior
to transfer to CCU, VS were 98.6 112/48 110 20 100% on CPAP with
PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 50%. He received 20 mg of IV lasix in the
PACU and was transferred to the CCU for further management.

Past Medical History:
1. Presumed Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 15-20% (echo
[**9-28**])
- diagnosed [**11-27**] when he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with cough, fever,

and increasing SOB. Chest CT showed bilateral lung infiltrates
and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with multifocal

pneumonia, and echocardiography showed moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %), with
normal valve function, and no pericardial effusion. Lab work
for RSV was positive, while HIV, influenza, EBV, CMV, Lyme and
multiple blood cultures were unremarkable. Repeated echo 10
months later confirms severely depressed and dilated LV with
LVEF of [**10-4**]%, and LVEDD of 7.8 cm
- last hospitalized [**5-29**] and [**12-30**] for CHF exacerbation, treated
with IV lasix
2. Childhood asthma
3. Morbid obesity
4. Sleep apnea - on CPAP but has not been using it
5. Moderate, Worsening pulmonary hypertension (46 mmHg [**9-28**])
(20-28 in [**4-28**])
6. Fatty Liver by CT. Obese and hx of EtOH. INR 1.4-1.7 since
[**5-29**]; Bili 1.7; HCV neg; HBV immune.


Social History:
He is unmarried and lives at home with his parents. He works as
a high school wrestling coach and in security. He never smoked.
He drank "a lot" in college, previously quoting 6 beer/weekend
but not elaborting this time; started drinking in [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32363**]
high school. He has a history of cocaine use, "a great deal" in
sophmore year. Drinks an occasional glass of wine.

Family History:
Father is 65 year-old and mother is 55 year-old.
Both have diabetes. He has 4 healthy older sisters. There is no
family history of SCD or cardiomyopathy.

Physical Exam:
VS: T= 101.2 BP= 98/48 (A-line 75/46) HR= 98 RR= 20 O2 sat= 92%
on CPAP PEEP 12, FiO2 50%.
GENERAL: obese M intubated, sedated
HEENT: NCAT. PERRL, EOMI.
NECK: unable to assess JVP due to body habitus.
CARDIAC: PMI laterally displaced. RR, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g.
No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
LUNGS: ventilated breath sounds
ABDOMEN: obese, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: [**12-22**]+ pitting edema bilaterally. +venous stasis
changes and dirt noted over bilateral extremities.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:
Right: DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: DP 2+ PT 2+

Discharge exam: vitals stable
pulmonary exam: clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Otherwise unchanged.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-8**]: In comparison with the study of [**12-23**], there is again
huge
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary
vascular
congestion. It is difficult to determine whether there are
layering
effusions, because of extensive scattered radiation related to
the body
habitus of the patient. The ICD line is poorly seen, though it
appears to
extend to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.

CXR [**1-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there are very
low lung
volumes. Huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
Pulmonary
vessels are difficult to evaluate, though they do not appear to
be especially engorged. The AICD line extends to the region of
the apex of the right ventricle. The area behind the hugely
enlarged heart cannot be evaluated for the possible presence of
pneumonia or effusion.

AP CHEST, 8:24 A.M. [**1-19**]

HISTORY: Intubated. Multilobar collapse or infection, assess
change.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-15**] and 28.

Severe cardiomegaly has improved since [**1-15**], subsequently
stable.
Previous mild pulmonary edema has also improved, though
pulmonary vascular
engorgement remains. Left lower lobe is consolidated, but has
probably
improved since [**1-15**] and since there was previously ipsilateral
mediastinal
shift much of that is probably atelectasis. The course of the
transvenous
right ventricular pacemaker lead is obscured in the heart by
cardiac motion.

Final Report
INDICATION: 24-year-old man with persistent fever after ICD
placement. Study
is to evaluate for source of infection.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet
through the
pubic symphysis without administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar
reformatted images were provided, essential in delineating
anatomy and
pathology.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is complete collapse of the
left lower lobe
and partial collapse of right lower lobe, with an endotracheal
tube in place.
This probably represent atelectasis, although underlying
infection cannot be
excluded particularly in the setting of fever and leukocytosis.
