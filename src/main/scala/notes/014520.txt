Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20640**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p central line placement


History of Present Illness:
56 yo F with h/o metastatic melanoma who was admitted on [**2187-7-9**]
for IL-2 therapy and now is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in the
setting of shortness of breath and hypoxia. Began IL-2 in PM of
[**7-9**] and has since gotten a total of 8 doses. Course has been
complicated by intermittent rigors, n/v/diarrhea, and
hypotension responsive to IVF boluses. Weight is 5% up from
baseline. Initially began to complain shortness of breath
yesterday afternoon when she triggered for RR 24, O2 sat 85% RA,
increased to 93% on 50% shovel mask. Remained hypoxic throughout
the evening and IVFs stopped, IL-2 held, and given albuterol
nebs for reported wheezing. Awoke at 1 am acutely short of
breath and gasping for air with O2 sats 76% on 2L NC --> 92 % on
NRB with RR 40. Other vitals notable for BP 120/60 (had
previously been running SBPs in 80-90s), HR 112. CXR revealed
marked bilateral interstitial markings with blurring of the
heart border concerning for pulmonary edema vs. ARDS. Given
lasix 12 mg IV X 1 with only 100 ccs of urine output and then
given lasix 20 mg IV X 1 and started on dopamine gtt at 2
mcg/kg/hr per biologics attending with subsequent 600 ccs in
urine output. ABG 7.39/37/62/23. Given another lasix 20 mg IV
and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing respiratory distress and
hypoxia.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient feels her breathing is
slightly improved but still labored. Denies chest pain/pressure,
lightheadedness, nausea, confusion, fevers. Intermittent chills.
Placed on BIPAP mask at 5/5 FiO2 70% with O2 sats 97-99%, given
morphine 1 mg IV X 1. Urine output in past hour 1L. Switched
dopamine to neosynephrine for HR 150s.


Past Medical History:
- Metastatic Melanoma - s/p R total maxillectomy with resection

of the pterygopalatine fossa as well as resection of tumor at
the skull base foramina at [**Hospital 13128**] in [**4-9**]. PET scan
[**5-10**] with increased uptake in lungs (multiple pulm nodules),
left hilar and subcarinal LAD. Admitted for IL-2 therapy on
[**2187-7-9**], s/p 8 doses
- DM II, insulin dependent
- HTN
- Hypercholesterolemia
- h/o cervical CA s/p radical hysterectomy, XRT/chemo in [**2173**]


Social History:
Recent widow, husband passed from bladder cancer approximately 8
mos ago. She has 2 daughters. Former [**Name2 (NI) 1818**] but quit 5 years
ago.

sentences due to shortness of breath
HEENT - JVP approximately 10-11 cm above sternal notch

bilaterally, anterior crackles also appreciated. No wheezes,
rhonchi.

Brief Hospital Course:
In short, Ms [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 56F with h/o metastatic melanoma on
IL-2 therapy started on [**7-10**], who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
after developing respiratory failure in the setting of chemo.
.
# Acute Respiratory Failure: Thought to be [**3-5**] ARDS in the
setting of systemic capillary leak from IL-2 therapy at first, w
subsequent overlying HAP, which eventually grew MRSA and
Enterobacter cloacae from the sputum. PE is a consideration, but
less likely given that hypoxia could be explained by pt's
worsening interstitial lung markings. Pt received
methylprednisolone intermittently to counter the effect of IL-2.
Was intubated on [**7-13**], temporarily paralyzed w vecuronium, s/p
failed extubation on [**7-19**], reintubated. Received TFs while
intubated. Concern for palatal swelling and aspiration
post-extubation (given s/p palate resection on [**4-/2187**] by Dr
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 65219**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82659**] for melanoma mets), however, per
discussion w ENT, no intervention needed. HAP was treated w a
14-day course of Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro ([**Date range (1) 82660**]). Also given
bronchodilators and lasix diuresis as tolerated by blood
pressure. Pt extubated on [**2187-7-22**].
.
# Fever, hypotension: likely [**3-5**] infection HAP, also
contribution from sedation (SBP down to 70s when sedated, up to
130s-160s when awake/agitated). Received supportive fluids as
well as temporary pressure support w norepinephrine and
phenylephrine drips. Infections treated w abx as above. Echo
showed EF of 50% with hypokinesis of low posterior wall, trop at
0.27 then 0.21, cardiology consulted, recommended aspirin and
hemodynamic support, no other intervention.
.
# Anemia: Hct baseline 32.8 on admission. Stable HCT 23-24.
Dropped likely in [**3-5**] acute procedures (line placement) in the
setting of anemia of chronic disease. [**Month (only) 116**] also be from dilution
with IVF for resuscitation.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**3-5**] IL-2 chemo. PLT 448 on admission,
nadired at 71, bounced back to 400s. HIT also considered, but
known side-effect of IL-2 therapy.

# Hypernatremia: Likely [**3-5**] dehydration and NS fluid
resuscitation, peaked at 151.

# Metastatic melanoma: Received IL-2 therapy w complications as
above. Followed by oncology team while in ICU.

# DM2: on sliding scale insulin on admission, but temporarily
required an insulin gtt in the setting of high-dose steroid
treatment.

# Code - Full, confirmed with patient
# Communication - with patient and daughter [**Name (NI) 82661**] [**Name (NI) 74914**]
