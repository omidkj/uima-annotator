Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2196-5-10**]: Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation


History of Present Illness:
52 year old man with multiple admissions for inhaled
freebase-cocaine pneumonitis, non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%,
and schizophrenia, who presents with respiratory distress.
Patient reports feeling short of breath since [**5-8**].  He reports
last smoking crack on [**5-6**].  Patient notes dyspnea on exertion
that has worsened over the course of three days, to the point
where he now has trouble ambulating from his bed to the
bathroom.  He reports no fever or night sweats, but does have
chills.  The patient also reports orthopnea and PND.  There is
chest tightness associated with his dyspnea.  He reports a dry
cough that has been present since he first started feeling short
of breath.  Patient reports being compliant with all of his
medications, and reports no specific dietary indiscretion.  He
does feel that his dose of furosemide does not seem to make him
urinate enough.
.
In the ED, initial VS were afebrile, HR 127, BP 123/79, RR 38,
O2 sat 99% on BIPAP.  Patient, in the field was 82% on RA, and
BIPAP was applied.  There was much improvement almost
immediately with this intervention, and patient reportedly
looked much improved upon arrival to the ED.  Lactate was
checked and was 1.7.  WBC count was 10.4K with 83% neutrophils,
no bands.  Sodium was 146, creatinine was 1.1.  Troponin was
noted to 0.05.  ProBNP was checked and was 4687.  UA was also
checked and was unremarkable.  Patient was administered
albuterol and ipratropium nebs x 2, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV
x 1, furosemide 100 mg IV x 1, lorazepam 2 mg IV x 1.  Urine
output in the ED was approximately 1 liter after furosemide
dosing.  Chest X-ray was performed and showed bibasilar
opacities similar to his previous imaging in 4/[**2195**].  Patient
was given vancomycin/cefepime for presumed HCAP.  Vitals on
transfer were pulse 120s, RR 30s, BP 121/64, 99-100% on BIPAP.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is noted to be tachypneic and
still on bipap, but reports feeling much better.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old man with schizophrenia, multiple admissions for
inhaled freebase-cocaine pneumonitis, non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%
who presented with respiratory distress, most consistent with an
acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation.

Active Issues:

# Actue on chronic Systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient presented
with respiratory distress, noted to be tachypneic with O2
saturation of 82% on room air initially, which improved back to
baseline with diuresis (lasix gtt). He had a history of crack
pneumonitis and systolic congestive heart failure, as well as a
diagnosis of COPD. Possible etiologies of the patient's
exacerbation included pneumonitis from continued crack use,
heart failure exacerbation or COPD exacerbation.  Given his
orthopnea, PND, and possible underdosing of his furosemide, pt
was diuresed with a lasix gtt with a large symptomatic
improvement.  His breathing appeared back to baseline after
agressive diuresis with lasix gtt in the ICU.  After being
called out to them edical floor pt was restarted on his home
dose of po lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He was also continued on his
ipratropium and albuterol nebs, as well as
fluticasone/salmeterol.  He was also continued on carvidelol and
lisinopril for sCHF.

# Type I Diabetes:  Pt's BG's were in the 400's initially in the
ICU, likely [**1-21**] to the high dose steroids he received in the ED.
 Once on the medical floor his BG's remained in the low 200's
before discharge.  He will follow up with his PCP for further
titration of his insulin.

# Schizophrenia: Patient was not currently on antipsychotics and
was scheduled to see a psychiatrist this week. He reports
continuously hearing voices, oftentimes telling him to hurt
himself. He has never acted on these voices, and has no current
suicidal or homicidal ideation. Psychiatry was consulted and
recommended outpt follow up.

# Hypertension:  continued home carvedilol, restarted lisinopril
before discharge as [**Last Name (un) **] was resolved.

Inactive Issues:

# Hyperlipidemia: continued home atorvastatin 20 mg daily

# Pain control: restarted tramadol 50 mg [**H
