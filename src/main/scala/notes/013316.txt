History of Present Illness:
86 year old female with dementia, who was complaining of dyspnea
and chest pain to her daughter last night. They called EMS who
brought her in. Here she denies complaints. Per her daughter,
she's been more confused lately. She also says she's had urinary
frequency and incontinence during the last 24 hours. She denies
that her mom has been coughing, having fevers, nausea, or
vomiting.

blood cultures were sent.

ROS negative other than noted above.

.
CXR ([**2147-5-16**]): IMPRESSION: New hazy opacities throughout the
left lung, most likely pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema,
less likely hemorrhage.
.
CT Head ([**2147-5-16**]): No evidence of acute intracranial
abnormalities.
.
CT Chest ([**2147-5-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Smooth intralobular septal thickening and ground-glass
opacity, greater on the left than right, favoring asymmetric
pulmonary edema. Although more
confluent left perihilar opacities could potentially be due to
asymmetrical edema, the degree of asymmetry raises concern for
superimposed left lung pneumonia.
2. Coronary arterial calcifications.
3. Moderate hiatal hernia.
4. Non-obstructive right nephrolithiasis.
.
Renal Ultrasound ([**2147-5-24**]):
IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for renal abscess.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
CT Chest [**6-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar opacities are worse than [**2147-5-25**] but improved from
CXR [**2147-6-2**] and are likely infectious with some component of
atelectasis. Improved opacity in the left upper lung but
worsening opacities in the right upper lung.
2. Slight increase in size in bilateral pleural effusions.
3. No evidence of cavitary pneumonia.
.
Most recent chest xray:
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to [**6-6**], [**2147**].

Significant improvement in pulmonary edema has been demonstrated
since the
prior study with patient currently in mild-to-moderate
interstitial edema. No interval increase in pleural effusion is
noted. There is no interval
development of pneumothorax. The right PICC line tip is at the
level of
cavoatrial junction.

.
[**6-15**]:  Spine films
Six total images of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine
demonstrate
S-shaped scoliosis, severe osteopenia. No discrete compression
fractures are identified. Vertebral body height appears to be
maintained. Alignment is maintained. There is a heavily
calcified aorta. Right-sided central catheter is present.

.
ECHO [**6-4**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal, anterior and
apical akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-1**],
the LVEF has decreased (the prior LVEF was overestimated - more
like 35-40%). The patient is now more tachycardic.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo woman admitted with community acquired pneumonia, with
prolonged hospitalization characterized by health care
associated pneumonia, PEA arrest, NSTEMI, ARF poorly controlled
atrial fibrillation and persistent leukocytosis of unclear
etiology, but afebrile, with stable vital signs, and needing
rehabilitation to return home with independent living.

.
Acute issues, by problem:
#. Community turned healthcare acquired bacterial pneumonia:
She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
about 24 hours, however her WBC count did not come down and she
continued to have low grade fevers, so she was changed to
levofloxacin on hospital day 2.  Metronidazole was later added
because of persistent fevers.  She had a CT of her chest that
showed a left lower lobe infiltrate.  However, she continued to
have leukocytosis and persistent fevers and her antibiotics were
thus broadened to include vancomycin/metronidazole/flagyl.  Her
white blood cell count did not improve and her fevers continued.
 As such, infectious disease was consulted.  A repeat CT chest
was performed that showed perhaps slight improvement.  However,
there were persistent infiltrates.  Pulmonary was consulted and
they felt that this was probably just a community acquired
pneumonia that is slow to resolve on imaging.  Levofloxacin was
continued through [**2147-5-26**] and was discontinued as she had
completed a 10 day course.  She was seen by  speech and swallow
recommended soft solids with thin
