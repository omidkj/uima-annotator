Date of Birth:   [**2116-8-21**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain for three weeks

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] is a 58-year-old
woman with a long smoking history who was transferred from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with chest pain and a troponin of 5.0.  She
has had these escalating episodes of chest pain for three
weeks which radiate to her armpits.  She has had shortness of
breath with these episodes.  She visited an outside Emergency
Department two weeks ago and was given sublingual
nitroglycerin which she has been taking with some relief.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for
further evaluation for chest pain.  Cardiac catheterization
was performed which revealed LAD 90% calcified origin, left
circumflex 40% proximal, RCA 80% mid, ejection fraction 45%
with apical hypokinesis.  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] was then evaluated for
cardiac surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
2.  Hyperlipidemia
3.  Tobacco abuse
4.  Carotid occlusion

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] [**Last Name (Titles) 42866**] two packs per day.  She
does not consume alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father had a myocardial infarction in
his 40s.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lovenox
2.  Aggrastat
3.  Nitropaste

The previous three medications were started in the outside
Emergency Room.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATION:  Aspirin 325 mg qd

ALLERGIES:  AMOXICILLIN

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 82, blood pressure 156/86, O2
saturation 99% on room air.
GENERAL:  The patient is a 58-year-old woman who is thin,
appearing older than her stated age in no apparent distress.
HEART:  Regular in rate and rhythm.  Breath sounds are
decreased bilaterally with wheezing.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Remarkable for 2+ pulses bilaterally with no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  CK 156, troponin 5.0.  Electrocardiogram
significant for inverted T-waves in leads V1 through V5.
Echocardiogram reveals an ejection fraction of 40% with
anterior septal akinesis and sclerotic aortic structure with
1+ mitral regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization results as
above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2175-7-7**] for coronary artery bypass graft x3.  Grafts
included a left internal mammary artery to LAD which was
performed off pump.  Also, RSVG to RCA and RSVG to
circumflex.  The operation was performed without
complication.  However, a large mass in the left upper lobe
of her lung was discovered during the procedure.  A
mediastinal node was biopsied at this time.  Pathology
results revealed poorly differentiated metastatic lung cancer
at this time.  Following the procedure, Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] was
transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit where
she was extubated and weaned off drips.  She was transfused 2
units of blood and hemodynamically stabilized.  While in the
unit, had several episodes of atrial fibrillation which were
successfully treated with intravenous and oral amiodarone.

Condition continued to improve and she was subsequently
transferred to the floor.  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] continued to recover
well on the floor with no further episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  She was tolerating oral diet and her pain was
controlled with oral medications.  She was ambulating well
although her oxygen requirement remained high.  On [**2175-7-14**],
Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] was felt stable for discharge home with home
oxygen and visiting nurse assistance.  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] was made
aware of her diagnosis of lung cancer which was discovered
during the procedure.  Prior to her discharge, she underwent
chest CT which was remarkable for a 2 cm spiculated left
upper lobe mass.  There were also enlarged lymph nodes
concerning for metastatic disease.  Head CT was negative for
evidence of metastasis.  She also underwent a bone scan which
was remarkable for increased tracer activity on the right
first rib and a focal area on anterior right second rib which
was considered consistent with early metastasis or
possibility of postsurgical changes.  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] will be
followed by oncology and thoracic surgery for this new
diagnosis.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.3??????, pulse 70, blood pressure
142/71, respirations 20, O2 saturation 95% on 2 liters.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Incision was
clean, dry and intact.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg qd
2.  Albuterol
3.  Ipratropium 1 to 2 puffs ih q6h
4.  Captopril 50 mg tid
5.  Plavix 75 mg qd
6.  Aspirin 325 mg qd
7.  Docusate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn
8.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets q 4 to 6 hours prn

weeks.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 42865**] is to be discharged home with
home oxygen and visiting nurse assistance.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft x3 with newly discovered metastatic lung cancer
