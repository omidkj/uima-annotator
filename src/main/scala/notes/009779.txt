Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female w/ h/o lymphoma, sacral fx, and spinal stenosis p/w
back pain.

1. Back pain: Her pain sxs are from the sacral fx that is
thought to be pathologic [**3-16**] XRT for her lymphoma.  Per Ortho
notes on [**2178-9-13**], the fx should be in the process of healing now
and her pain should be getting better.  The CT today showed a
healing fx.  Pt essentially here for better pain control.  Given
Motrin for her pain.  Good control while lying down but in a lot
of pain when attempting to sit or stand. The pain service
recommended Oxycontin, Oxycodone, Tylenol, Vioxx, and a muscle
relaxant. She was discharged on that same regimen for her pain
before without control. Decision was made to have surgery and pt
underwent a L3-S1 posterior spinal fusion on [**2178-10-30**]. During
the procedure, the pt received a large amount of IV fluids and
blood products resultsing in CHF exacerbation and prolonged
intubation as outlined below. Pt's postop pain was initially
controlled on a hydromorphone PCA and then changed to percocet
on [**2178-11-3**]. She had good pain control at the time of
discharged. Had been working with physical therapy.

2. Diarrhea: Unclear etiology of the diarrhoea.  Sent off O&P
and C.diff assays x3.  The results were negative. Diarrhea has
now resolved.

3. Respiratory distress: Pt received a large amount of blood
products and IV fluids during her spinal surgery resulting in
CHF and inability to extubate. At that time, the patient was
transferred to the medical service in the MICU. In the MICU, the
pt was agressively diuresed with IV lasix. In addition, her BP
was tightly controlled with a nitro drip, beta blocker, and
ACEi. Pt was extubated on [**11-1**] following a good diuresis. Her
respiratory status continued to improve throughout the course
and was stable on discharge.

4. CHF: Pt had a CHF exacerbation following receiving a large
amount of volume during surgery. A TTE was done on [**2178-11-2**]
which showed a normal LVEF with diastolic dysfunction. Pt was
agressively diuresed following surgery until [**2178-11-4**]. At that
time, there was no evidence of CHF on CXR and she was becoming
contracted on labs. At that time, goal was to keep the pt even.
Pt was continued on beta blocker, ACEi, and oral nitrate.

5. CAD: Pt has a history of CAD with placement of stents. She
had no evidence of ischemia during the hospitalization. Pt was
continued on beta blocker, ACEi, statin, and ASA.

6. Hypothyroidism: Pt was continued on levothyroxine throughout
the hospitalization.

7. Type 2 DM: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained during the
admission. The pt's insulin was adjusted as needed during the
hospitalization according to her food intake and blood sugar
levels.

8. ID: Pt spiked a temperature on [**11-1**]. She was started on
cefazolin emperically but found to have a left lower lobe
infiltrate on CXR. It was unclear if this was PNA or
atalectasis. IS was encouraged. Cultures are negative to date.
Pt will complete a 10 day course of antibiotics.
