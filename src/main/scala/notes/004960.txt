HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
woman with a past medical history of HIV and a recent CD4
count of 155 on [**12-7**] with viral load less than 50,
cardiomyopathy, a questionable history of hyperparathyroidism
and end stage renal disease on dialysis secondary to HIV
nephropathy, who initially presented with shortness of
breath.  The patient reported shortness of breath upon lying
down, generalized fatigue in addition to several months of
right upper quadrant pain involving the legs, back and
abdomen.  She reported this information at her hemodialysis
and was sent to the Emergency Department for work up.

In the Emergency Department, crackles were found on exam.
Chest x-ray was questionable for faint infiltrate.  The
patient was started on Levofloxacin in the Emergency
Department and admitted to the [**Company 191**] Service for monitoring and
work up.  The Levofloxacin was not continued because the
etiology was thought to be more consistent with viral.

hospital course as described below.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Endocrine - After the first day of admission, the patient
had a sudden acute agitation and change in mental status.
Glucose on a.m. labs was measured to be 17.  The patient also
reported nausea and vomiting.  The patient's glucose was
persistently low despite amp of D50.  She was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit and started on a D10W drip in the
unit.

Extensive work up included Cortisol 20 at 5 a.m., Insulin
144, ACTH 16, Pro-Insulin 113.  TSH, 3.2; C-peptide 5.5.  CT
of the head at the time was negative.

The patient was maintained on the glucose drip for several
days and her glucose gradually increased.  Abdominal and
chest CT scans were negative for mass consistent with
Insulinoma or Insulin like secreting masses.  The patient was
felt to most likely have a chemical pancreatitis from her HIV
regimen.  Once her glucose came up, it was persistently
stable.  The patient was also stable on 24 hour fast, and
glucose levels were adequate for the remainder of the
hospital stay.

The Endocrine Service was consulted initially and followed
throughout the hospital course.  They did not feel there was
a need for follow up unless the patient demonstrates
hypoglycemia in the future.  During her Intensive Care Unit
stay, the patient demonstrated hyponatremia felt to be
secondary to dilution from D10W infusions.  On the day of
discharge, the patient's sodium is 135.  In addition, she has
been slightly hypercalcemic, felt to be related to
hyperparathyroidism, managed by her Nephrologist.

2.  Infectious Disease - During this episode of agitation and
hypoglycemia, the patient was found to be in metabolic
acidosis with a component of both lactic acidosis and renal
failure.  As the patient also demonstrated herself to be in
DIC (see below) an exhaustive infectious work up was
performed including pan CT, blood culture, fungal culture,
urine, Legionella/histo, PPD, viral and nasopharyngeal swab,
BAL, all of which proved to be negative.

Initially, the patient was covered with Vancomycin, Cefepime
and Metronidazole, as well as Acyclovir.  Eventually, it was
felt that the most likely diagnosis was mitochondrial
toxicity related to NRTI treatment.  The NRTIs were
discontinued.  The patient was started on carnitine infusion
as well as riboflavin, multi-vitamin and Thiamin.

She rapidly improved.  The rapid chronicity of her
improvement was felt to actually be inconsistent with
mitochondrial toxicity, however, in the context of
hemodialysis, it was still felt to be the most likely
diagnosis.  The patient was stabilized and transferred to the
Floor where she had substantial diarrhea.  C diff was
positive.  Vancomycin and Cefepime was discontinued and the
patient was started on a 14 day course of Flagyl.

The patient has been afebrile through the duration of her
hospital stay.  As Bactrim could be exacerbating the
pancreatitis, the patient was given one dose of inhaled
Pentamidine and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4427**] regarding
further PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

3.  Hematology - The patient developed thrombocytopenia to
56.  She was discovered to be in DIC with PT of 28, PTT of
140.  D-Dimer 500 to 1,000.  FDP, 10 to 40; FCN 95.  Lactic
acidosis, 11.9.  Rectal, occult blood positive.

Hem/Onc was consulted regarding the DIC as well as the
microcytosis with occasional schistocytes.  As described
above, extensive Infectious Disease work up was done for
cause of DIC and it was found to be negative.  The patient
improved and was transferred to the Floor.  Antibody was sent
and is pending.  The patient was transfused.  Her CBC is now
stable and the patient received Erythropoietin once a week at
dialysis.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient developed severe abdominal
pain during her hospital stay.  She was initially complaining
of several weeks to months of right upper quadrant pain,
however, her pain became more diffuse.  It was felt to be
related to a chemical pancreatitis as amylase and lipase were
elevated up to 300 and 400 respectively.  The patient's
medication regimen was reviewed and Bactrim withheld as
possible cause of the chemical pancreatitis.  Abdominal CT
was done and was negative.

Initially when the patient was in the Intensive Care Unit,
she was fed via tube feedings.  By the time she was
discharged, she was tolerating a full diet without any
abdominal pain.

5.  Renal - The patient received hemodialysis on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.  The Renal Team was following her
closely during her hospital stay.

6.  Pulmonary - Initially when the patient was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit, she was intubated for "weakness".
She was easi
