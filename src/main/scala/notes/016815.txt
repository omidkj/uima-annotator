Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall with subdural hematoma and traumatic sah

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 The patient is an 86 year old woman with a history of CAD, ?
atrial fibrillation ? on Coumadin, and asthma who is s/p
unwitnessed fall and was transferred from an OSH for SAH and
SDH. The patient is unable to relay a history, so the history is
obtained from the medical records. The patient was found down
after an unwitnessed fall in a parking lot. Paramedics found her

with a GCS of 13.
 .
She was taken to an OSH where her bp on admission was 178/77.
She was reported as confused on arrival, "does not know name,
disoriented to time and events." There were no lab values sent
from the OSH. Head CT showed SAH in the right frontal lobe,
small 2 mm thick SDH overlying the left frontal lobe and along
the tentorium, and a nondisplaced occipital skull fracture. CT
C-spine showed a nondisplaced left occipital skull fracture with
overlying soft tissue swelling and small SDH along tentorium, no
cervical spine fracture. She was given Fosphenytoin 1 gm IV x1
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

.
Head CT [**2-5**]: Grossly unchanged appearance of intracranial
hemorrhage.
Head CT [**2156-2-14**]: Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage
including bifrontal subdural hematoma, subarachnoid, and
parenchymal hemorrhage.
2. No acute intracranial abnormality.
.
Chest CT [**2157-2-10**]: 1. Acute pulmonary emboli in segmental and
subsegmental pulmonary arteries of the right lower lobe and
lingula with no signs of right ventricular strain.
2. Incidental left upper lobe nodule noted on recent CT of the
upper
extremity containing a large amount of fat, likely a benign
hamartoma.
3. Signs of small airway disease. Scattered peribronchial
ground-glass
opacity in the right upper lobe, could be inflammatory or
infectious, should be correlated with clinical information.
4. Mildly dilated esophagus, likely presbyesophagus.
5. Mild cardiomegaly and right atrium enlargement.
6. Bilateral small pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yoF w/ a h/o unwitnessed fall c/b SAH/SDH, non surgically
managed, transferred to medicine from neursurgery service when
incidentally found to have pulmonary emboli, received an IVC
filter after repeat CT head was found to have an increase in
SDH.
.
# NSurg Course: The patient had an unwitnessed fall and a SDH,
she initally was intubated and her coagulopathy related to
coumadin use was reversed (INR initially was only 1.8, now 1.2).
 She also had an occiptal fracture which was non displaced.
Upon f/u CT scan these findings were unchanged.  She was
extubated after 1 day. Ms [**Known lastname 80687**] was admitted to Nsurg through
the ER where she was intubated and received Profiline to reverse
her coagulopathy. She was admitted to the ICU for close neuro
observation she underwent a follow up CT which was unchanged for
presence of blood and unchanged occipital fracture. She was
extubated on her first hospital day and was noted to have a low
sodium she was fluid restricted for 24 hours which elevated the
NA to 133. On her second hospital day she was transferred to the
floor she was seen by speech and swallow who recommend a purred
diet. She was seen by PT/OT who recommended rehab placement.
She was treated for UTI.  She complained of left shoulder pain
and xray showed no fx however was found to have incidental
finding on CT UE of 1cmx.08 nodule which was found to benign on
Chest CT. However upon Chest CT she was found to have bilat
segmental and subsegmental PEs. Medicine was called for
transfer. She also had a head CT on [**2-10**] to assess for ability
to anticoagulate per Medicine which was found to show a possible
increase in the size of the subdural hematoma.  She was started
on Heparin IV for anticoagulation on [**2157-2-12**] after discussion
with the neurosurgery team and the medicine team.  Her
neurologic exam remained stable and a repeat CT on [**2157-2-14**] showed
stable intracranial hemorrhage with expected evolution of blood
products.
**This patient has follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] of neurosurgery on
[**2157-4-5**] at 11:30am in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building, [**Location (un) 551**] Spine
Center of [**Hospital1 18**].  She has a Head CT scheduled for [**2157-4-5**] at
10:30am in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Buiding of [**Hospital1 18**].  She should not eat for
3 hours proir to the scan.
.
# Subsegmental PEs: Seen incidentally after CT of shoulder (done
due to pain) demonstrated a lung abnormality, which prompted a
CT of chest demonstrating PE's. Thought to be acute and occuring
in the setting of subtherapeutic INR as well as INR reversal.
No hypoxia or hemodynamic instability.  Heparin IV was started
on [**2157-2-12**].  After head CT was stable on [**2157-2-14**], coumadin 5mg
per day was started.
.
**This patient should continue the heparin IV with Coumadin and
overlap for 2 days once her INR is between 2.0 and 3.0.  After 2
days of overlap with both heparin and coumadin, the heparin
should be stopped.  She should be monitored for neurologic signs
and symptoms for worsening head bleed.  She should follow-up
with her primary care doctor to check her INR on a regular basis
after leaving the nursing home.
.
# Urinary tract infection: Pt. has some suprapubic pain, Urine
Cx grew out E.coli and enterococcus which were both sensitive to
Nitrofurantoin.  She was treated initially with Bactrim and then
changed to Nitrofurantoin once sensitivities returned.  She
started on [**2157-2-11**] and should complete this on [**2157-2-18**] to finish
a 10 day course.
.
# Rash: The patient developed a maculopapular rash on her
abdomen and left arm on [**2157-2-13**].  This was believed to be due to
Dilantin use.  The Dilantin was stopped and her rash improved.
She was st
