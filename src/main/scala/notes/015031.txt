pulm HTN, R THA '[**84**] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with
Vancouver B periprosthetic fx of R femur around THA with failed
femoral component. Both geriatrics and cardiology consults were
obtained to assist with perioperative management. Echocardiogram
was performed today and showed normal EF and moderate to severe
AS as above. PA pressure monitoring was recommended during
surgery as was blood transfusion with careful diuresis. Of note,
the patient had undergone pulmonary evaluation for pre-op risk
for possible elective aortic valve replacement given significant
limitations in functional status as well as recent episode of
CHF [**5-24**].
.
She underwent surgical repair which was extensive given degree
of osteoporosis and fracture. Surgery lasted for 8+ hrs. During
the surgery she lost approx 2 L blood, received 6 units pRBCs,
6L of crystalloid and maintained a CVP 7-10 without requiring
pressor support. She was transferred to the ICU for close
post-operative monitoring.
.
ROS: The patient is unable to provide ROS given sedation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assesment: This is an 84 year-old female with a history of
mod-severe AS (valve area 0.8-1.0), mild COPD, pulm HTN,
osteoporosis s/p repair of periprosthetic fracture of the right
femur.
.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF ICU COURSE:
# Right periprosthetic femur fracture: s/p surgical repair today
(R THA Femoral component w/ fixation R femur)
- Lovenox initiated for DVT PPX
- ABX for 24 hr - Ancef
- Hip abduction pillow/brace
- pain control
- repeat hip/femur X-ray [**10-8**]
- Monitor uop
.
#Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated post-op. The pat
has been given >8L fluids intra-op and post-op.  Pt with history
of severe AS and given volume status may be difficulty weaning
from vent.  However, CXR in the AM did not show increasing
pulmonary edema. The patient as weaned from the ventilator and
sucessfully extubated on [**10-6**].  The patient was placed on nasal
cannula and was weaned down to her basline O2 requirement of 2L.

.
#Hypotension:  The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated
post-op.  She was given sedation and her MAP dropped to the
50's.  She was given IVF bolus and 0.4 narcan and her pressures
responded.  On [**10-6**] the patient was hypotensive and placed on
phenylepherine.  They were able to be weaned for 3 hours, but
she became hypotensive with MAPs in the 50's.  She was given a
fluid bolus with little response and placed back on
phenylepherine overnight.  She was sucessfully weaned off
pressors the next morning.  Her blood pressures remained at a
baseline SBP 110-120's off pressors and mentating well.  The
patient's urine output remained 30-40cc/hrs throughout her
admission to the ICU.
.
# Anemia: The patient had ~2L EBL and was given 6U pRBCs given
in OR.  Her Hct was 23.1 and was transfused 1UpRBC on [**10-7**] and
an additional 1U pRBC on [**10-8**].
- Monitor CRIT
.
# Aortic Stenosis (Mod-severe - valve area 0.8-1.0cmsq): Seen by
cardiology pre-op. Received pRBC transfusion prior to surgery,
b-blocker continued perioperatively. Did well during surgery w/
CVP 7-10 and SBP 100-110 without need for pressors.  The
patient's CVP was maintained >7 and MAPs were maintained > 65
with fluid and pressors.  The patient was followed by
cardiology. Long term plan for elective AV replacement.
.
# COPD - Mild by PFTs. Poor respiratory reserve felt to be
secondary to AS/cardiac
The patient was continued on Flovent and albuterol prn.
.
# Osteoporosis
- VitD/Ca post-op and cont. bisphosphonate
.
# GERD
-Continue PPI
.
# FEN: Cardiac diet, monitor volume status closely given AS,
replete lytes prn
.
# PPX: Lovenox post-op, bowel regimen, PPI
.
# Access: R subclavian CVL was pulled on [**10-6**] dueto the line
being in vertebral vein. A new RIK was placed on [**10-7**], A-line,
PIV x 2
.
# Code: full code per medical record, will confirm with family

patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's
hematocrit was stable, and the patient's pain was adequately
controlled on a PO regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. The patient was
discharged to rehabilitation in a stable condition.  The
patient's weight-bearing status was touchdown weight bearing on
