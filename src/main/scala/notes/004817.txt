History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 59022**] is a 50 year old female with questionable history of
alcohol abuse in the past, HTN, CRI with baseline 2.8, and
nephrolithiasis, who was transfered from an outside hospital
with fulminant liver and renal failure.  Her current illness
began 3 weeks ago at which time she presented to an ED with URI
symptoms and was given cough medicine.  She saw her PCP one week
later with continued URI symptoms, and orthopnea, and was
prescribed zithromax, prednisone, and flonase.  She began to
note hematuria and numbness and weakness of her extremities.
Over the next week she developed abdominal pain, bloating,
decreased urine output, fever, and chills, at which time she
presented again to the outside hospital.  There, she was found
to have markedly elevated transaminases, liver failure, and
acute renal failure.

She denied nausea, vomiting, dysuria, though has had decreased
apetite.  She has had a cough productive of sputum.  No
hematochezia or melena.  No sick contacts.  She has been using
[**1-4**] 325 mg tylenol tabs a day.  She denied mushroom exposure.

EKG unchanged from baseline.  No ST/T changes.

She was treated for hyperkalemia with kayexalate, ca gluconate.
She was given mucomyst for possible tylenol OD, though tylenol
levels were found to be normal.  Abdominal CT scan showed:  No
evidence of apendicitis.  Marked thickening of GB wall, which
could be related to ascites, however acute cholecystitis can't
be ruled out.  Underdistension/thickening of the ascending
colon.  LLL consolidation with b/l small pleural effusions.  She
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

RAPID PLASMA REAGIN TEST (Final [**2109-1-1**]):
      NONREACTIVE.
      Reference Range: Non-Reactive.

CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2109-1-1**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      <4 AU/ML.
      Reference Range:  Negative < 4 AU/ml, Positive >= 6 AU/ml.


   CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2109-1-1**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      INTERPRETATION:  NO ANTIBODY DETECTED.
      Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2103**] mg/dl

      NEGATIVE <1:10 BY IFA.
      INTERPRETATION: RESULTS INDICATIVE OF PAST EBV INFECTION.
      In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at
sometime
      with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA
antibodies.
      Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary
infection and
      remain present for life. Presence of VCA IgM antibodies
indicates
      recent primary infection.

      NEGATIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
