HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 71-year-old man
with history of metastatic carcinoid tumor of bronchial
origin (metastatic to bone and liver) status post multiple
chemotherapy treatments, resection of tumor from left upper
lobe of lung in [**2146**], chemoembolization of liver metastases
([**2152**], [**2153**]), and is currently on a clinical trial of an oral
tyrosine kinase inhibitor affecting VEGFR/PDGFR families,
SU011248, also known as Sugen and concurrently taking
Sandostatin.  Over the years he has had multiple episodes of
flushing/diarrhea with carcinoid crises.

The patient was in his usual state of health until five days
prior to admission when he developed facial and upper
thoracic flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis,
nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.  Over the course of the few
days, the emesis became bloody and the patient developed
maroon-colored stools.  When his fatigue became intolerable,
his wife brought him to an outside hospital, where he was
found to be hypotensive blood pressure 77/52, and
tachycardic, heart rate 122.  He was given fluid boluses, had
a single episode of syncope with a blood pressure of 56
systolic/palp.  He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells
and his vital signs stabilized.  He was transferred to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit on [**7-8**] as he primarily
gets his care at the [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Carcinoid tumor.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2159**] found to be candidal
esophagitis.
3. Formally used alcohol, but quit in [**2159**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Ibuprofen prn--increased use prior to admission
2. Sandostatin q month.
3. Sugen.

ALLERGIES:  Horse serum - the patient develops a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with five children.
Lives with wife.  Is a retired lawyer and formally drank [**1-26**]
drinks per day, but quit in [**2159**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother with hepatic and
pancreatic cancer.  Father liver cancer.  Mother abdominal
cancer and grandparents both died of cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.0, blood pressure
100/60, heart rate 121, respirations 16, and oxygen
saturation 94% on room air.  Generally, patient was pale,
pleasant, and lethargic gentleman in no apparent distress.
HEENT revealed no oral lesions, but dry oral mucosa.  Neck
was supple with no jugular venous distention and no
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Heart sounds
were regular, but tachycardic, no murmurs.  Abdominal
examination was benign.  Liver margin palpated 1 cm below
costal margin.  Extremities showed no edema.  Patient had no
rashes.  Neurologic examination:  Patient was alert and
oriented times three, full strength, 1+ deep tendon reflexes
at patella, but absent ankle jerk reflexes.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 11.3, hematocrit
23.7, platelets 125.  INR 1.6, PT 15.4, PTT 25.4.  Normal
electrolytes.  BUN and creatinine 54 and 0.8.  ALT 232, AST
688, alkaline phosphatase 159, total bilirubin 0.8.  Lactate
dehydrogenase 1870, CK 1553.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Atrial fibrillation:  On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the
patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was
converted to normal sinus rhythm with 5 mg of IV Lopressor,
and he has remained in normal sinus rhythm ever since.

2. GI:  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on the
morning of [**7-9**], and revealed severe esophagitis, mild
antral gastritis, but no site of active bleeding.  The
patient was started on IV Protonix for 24 hours and then was
switched to Protonix 40 mg po bid, which he is to continue
for at least one month.

With regards to his maroon-colored stool, it was felt that
although this could be secondary to the upper GI bleed, a
lower source of bleeding should be ruled out and a
colonoscopy is recommended as an outpatient.  As patient had
a history of candidal esophagitis, he was also started on an
empiric course of nystatin swish and swallow this admission,
however, no biopsies were obtained during the EGD to confirm
this diagnosis.

3. Elevated liver function tests:  These were likely
secondary to shock liver from the hypotensive episode the
patient had the outside hospital.  LFTs continued to trend
down throughout his admission as blood pressure remains
stable.  On day of discharge, ALT was 50, AST 28, alkaline
phosphatase 151, and a total bilirubin of 1.4.  No further
intervention was necessary at this time.

4. Anemia:  Patient was found to have a very low hematocrit
of 23 on admission.  He was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells in the Intensive Care Unit, and required another
2 units on the floor.  His hematocrit remained above 30 a
few days prior to discharge.  He was to followup closely
regarding need for a subsequent transfusion.

5. Infectious disease:  Once transferred out of the unit onto
the floor, the patient complained of a chest pain across the
lower right aspect of his sternum and he developed a fever of
101.2.  Although he was sating well on room air at rest, it
was noted that the patient had an ambulatory saturation in
the mid 80s.  A chest x-ray was done, which initially was
negative for an infiltrate, however, clinical suspicion was
high.  A CT scan was performed which showed left lower lobe
pneumonia.  The patient was started on clindamycin and Levaquin.
He remained afebrile and by the day of discharge had an
ambulatory oxygen saturation greater than 95%.

6. Pneumothorax:  On admission to the Intensive Care Unit, a
right sided triple lumen catheter was placed, which resulted
in a small pneumothorax, which was stable throughout his
hospital per serial chest x-rays and CT scans.  No further
intervention was required.

7. Rule out myocardial infarction:  When patient first
presented to the Intensive Care Unit, he had elevated CKs and
an electrocardiogram showing ST depressions in the
inferolateral leads.  He proceeded to rule out for myocardial
infarction via serial enzymes and follow-up
electrocardiograms.  This is most likely secondary to demand
ischemia from hypovolemia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to esophagitis.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3. Left lower lobe pneumonia.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 mg po bid.
2. Lidocaine solution 5 mL swish and swallow tid.
3. Nystatin swish and swallow 5 mL po qid.
4. Clindamycin 300 mg po q8h for seven days.
5. Levaquin 500 mg po q day for seven days.
6. Colace 100 mg po bid.
7. Neutra-Phos one packet po bid.

The patient was instructed to continue taking Protonix twice
a day for at least one month and to followup with his primary
doctor regarding the plan for discontinuation of this
medication.  He was also instructed to not take any aspirin,
ibuprofen, Naprosyn, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medications.  He was also instructed to avoid caffeine,
smoking, or any other stomach irritants.  It was recommended
that he get a colonoscopy as an outpatient, as well as repeat EGD
with biopsy.  He is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic on [**7-20**] at 9:30 in the morning
and also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23206**], [**Hospital **] Clinic on [**7-30**]
at 11 in the morning.
