Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75yo male with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p overlapping DES to LAD [**6-27**]
then [**8-29**] and CABG, hyperlipidemia, HTN, DM2 who presents with
respiratory distress.
.
The patient reports symptoms of shortness of breath and
productive cough for the past 6 days.  Leg swelling is mildly
increased as well.  His weight is up 2lbs.  He denies fevers,
chills, nausea or vomiting.  The patient has an extensive
cardiac history but denies chest pain, palpitations, dizziness,
lightheadedness, orthopnea, PND or syncope.
.
On Saturday, he reported dyspnea to his PCP and was prescribed
azithromycin but did not improve.  He contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP today
and was sent to the the ED for his symptoms.  He denies
increased fluid intake, recent hospitalization, medication
changes, increased salt intake, recent travel or sick contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] denies any angina.  He has been compliant with all his
medications.
.
On arrival to the ED, vital signs were T- 97.2, HR- 72, BP-
130/67, RR- 24, SaO2- 94% RA.  Given marked respiratory
distress, he was placed on BiPAP with rapid improvement in his
clincal status.  He also received albuterol and ipatropium
nebulizers.  Imaging was consistent with pulmonary edema and
possible pneumonia, for which he received lasix 20mg IV x 1 and
levofloxacin.  BNP near his baseline at [**Numeric Identifier 7206**] and first set of
cardiac enzymes was negative.  EKG revealed a ventricular paced
rhythm that did not meet Sgarbossa criteria for ischemia.  Given
tenous respiratory status, he is being admitted to the CCU.
.
On arrival to the CCU vital signs were T- 98.4, HR- 74, BP
139/67, RR-17, SaO2- 97% on 2L NC.  Patient reports improvement
in his symptoms and is currently satting 97% on 2L NC.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Studies:
CXR: 1. Mild-to-moderate alveolar pulmonary edema. Given that a
concomitant
bibasilar infectious process cannot be excluded, post-diuresis
radiographs are
recommended.
2. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105012**] is a 75 year old man who presented with acute on
chronic diastolic HF thought to be due to secondary to
pneumonia.
.
#.DYSPNEA: likely multifactorial in the setting of pneumonia
with acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation.  Another
possibility is new atrial fibrillation with worsening CHF.  On
admission, he was found to have bilateral crackles, elevated BNP
(althought not drastically above previous levels), lower
extremity and cardiac wheeze on exam which were consistent with
CHF exacerbation.  The patient responded well to lasix 20mg IV
in ED (1L output in 6 hours), which is essentially was his home
dose.  Diuresis was continued (approximately 2L/day net
negative). Besides new afib, another potential trigger for CHF
exacerbation is likely infection given PNA on CXR. Levofloxacin
ws started for planned 8 day course. In light of CHF
exacerbation and history of AS a repeat echo was obtained and
demonstrated normal cavity size and global systolic function (LV
> 55%) as well as minimal aortic stenosis with a peak gradient
of 21 torr. Mr. [**Known lastname 105012**] was discharged on torsemide 40mg PO
daily and metolazone as needed (take 2 tabs if weight gain) as
well as metoprolol and nitroglycerin.

#.ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: New AF for patient. Given comorbidities
and CHADS2 score of 4, we initially elected to bridge with
heparin while coumadin became therapeutic but in light of prior
bleed decided to hold on anticoagulation. Rate control was
achieved with Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg [**Hospital1 **]. TSH was within
normal limits.

#.CAD: We doubted ischemia as a cause for the CHF exacerbation
as he denied chest pain, CE were negative, and EKG does not meet
Sgarbossa criteria. Patient on appropriate cardiac medications
except for a statin (as patient has had a low LDL off statins)
and ACE-I (no history of systolic dysfunction and CKD).
.
#.IDDM: Home insulin regimen was continued.
.
#.ESRD s/p TRANSPLANT: Cr 2.6 on admission which is close to
baseline for him. Home cellcept and prograf were continued as
was PCP prophylaxis with bactrim.
.
#.RIGHT INDEX FINGER PAIN: While admitted, Mr. [**Known lastname 105012**]
complained of right index finger pain secondary to presumed
gouty arthritis. He underwent surgery for this chronic index
finger pain in [**2148-12-22**]. He espoused decreased range of
motion and pain co
