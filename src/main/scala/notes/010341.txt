Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation (done at OSH)

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 59 year-old man with a history of asthma and
chronic back pain for which he is on methadone, who presents
following 3 seizures.  Patient was intubated on arrival, so
history obtained from records as well as conversation with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 91302**] who was caring from him initially in the [**Hospital3 6592**]
emergency department.  The patient reportedly attends a
methadone
clinic daily, either for chronic lower back pain, or for a
remote
history of substance abuse, reports vary.  He has a friend who
picks him up every day, who came to his house this morning and
noted that he had to pound on the door to wake him up this
morning, and felt he was 'just not quite right' though we have
no
further details of precisely what this involved.  His friend
placed him in the taxi cab, but enroute to the methadone clinic
he became unresponsive and was 'jerking all over'.  They stopped
at the nearest fire station, and on arrival he was reportedly
lethargic, and thought to be post-ictal by the firemen.  He then
became combative. FSG at that time was reported to be 131. He
was
brought to [**Hospital3 6592**], where on arrival Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91302**] made it
as far as asking him his name, when he became unresponsive,
staring off into space, with his jaw clenched, and then
proceeded
to have rhythmic jerking movements of all his extremities,
lasting 2-3 minutes.  He was given 2mg of Ativan, repeated once,
right at the end of this episode.  At this time he was noted to
have dilated pupils and snoring respirations, and was initially
lethargic, but then began to come around again, and was
reportedly combative.  The decision was made at that time to
load
him with fosphenytoin and intubate him for airway protection.
As
they were preparing to intubate him he again developed a blank
stare, followed by jaw clenching and rhythmic jerking of his
extremities.  He was then paralyzed and sedated with propofol,
with no further seizure activity noted prior to transfer.

Per discussion with the [**Hospital3 6592**] emergency department, he
was last seen in their hospital in [**2104**], at which time he was
admitted for cellulitis.  His only other medical history
documented at that time was of asthma, as well as a report of a
lung/chest tumor removal, though it is unclear what that was.
According to the methadone clinic, he has no other documented
medications.  He does have a son, who so far has not been
available by phone, and the friend who brought him in the taxi
refused to leave his name and phone number for any further
questions.

Patient intubated, unable to answer ROS.

IMAGING:
MRI [**2108-10-11**]: IMPRESSION: Small subcortical acute infarct in the
right cerebral hemisphere identified. No enhancing brain
lesions, mass effect or hydrocephalus. No intrinsic
abnormalities within the hippocampi on coronal T2 images.

ECHO [**2108-10-11**]: Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast at rest (patient intubated). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

CTA HEAD/NECK [**2108-10-12**]: IMPRESSION:
HEAD CT: No acute intracranial process.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: Limited study secondary to motion in the
neck, atherosclerotic disease is difficult to quantify on this
exam


Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a 59 year-old man with a history of asthma and chronic
back pain for which he is on methadone, who presented following
3 seizures found to have a small stroke in his R cerebral
hemisphere.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU intubated and sedated. He was
initially on dilantin (goal level of 15-20). His exam showed
some decreased movement on the R-side, prompting an MRI which
revealed a very small R-sided infarct that did not seem to
explain his seizures or weakness. He was started on ASA 325mg QD
and CTA of the head and neck was unremarkable. An LP showed 5
WBCs and 4,000 RBCs. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone,
ampicillin and acyclovir u
