Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 6330**] is an 80 year old woman with a PMH significant for
COPD, CAD s/p PCI, AF, HTN, and PAD who presents with 5-7 days
of increased dyspnea and productive cough now admitted to the
MICU for respiratory distress.  The patient reports that over
the past 5-7 days, she has developed worsening productive cough
described as yellowish/greenish sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and
fatigue. She was seen by her PCP 2 days prior to admission and
was started on prednisone 60 mg daily, and also prescribed
amoxicillin that she has not yet started.  She reports that
since starting prednisone, she has not had any improvement, and
thus presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.8, 100, 160/82, 30, 78%2L NC. CXR
was negative for focal consolidation. Labs notable for a WBC of
16.2 and an INR 4.2. ABG 7.28/72/66 on an unknown amount of
supplemental oxygen. She was placed on NPPV, but became
transiently hypotensive to 80/40 with improvement after NPPV
discontinued. The patient received 125 mg IV solumedrol,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. She was then admitted to the MICU
for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old woman with COPD, CAD s/p PCI, HTN, and AFib,
admitted with respiratory distress; hospital course complicated
by AFib with RVR.
.
# Respiratory distress: History and hypercarbia consistent with
COPD exacerbation. CXR without focal consolidation to suggest
lobar pneumonia, although sputum culture returned with heavy
Moraxella growth. Patient was treated with a 5 day course of
levofloxacin and a corticosteroid taper: prednisone 40mg daily
through [**4-7**], then 20mg daily from [**Date range (1) 15356**], then 10mg daily
from [**Date range (1) 15357**]. We continued the patient's home Atrovent prn
SOB/wheezing. The patient has a chronically elevated bicarbonate
which is likely compensation for her chronic respiratory
acidosis in the setting of severe COPD. Recommend trending her
bicarb. O2 sats are in the low-mid 80s on RA but 93-100% on 3L.
.
# AFib with RVR/Atrial Flutter: The patient had repeated
episodes of AFlutter/AFib with RVR to 150s. She was rate
controlled with metoprolol which was uptitrated to 37.5mg q6h.
She was also started on an amiodarone load: 200mg TID x1 week
([**Date range (1) 67487**]), then 200mg [**Hospital1 **] x1 week ([**Date range (1) 86878**]), then 200mg daily.
HR has been stable in the 70s-80s. Would tolerate HR to the 130s
as long as patient is asymptomatic. If HR increases beyond the
130s and is sustained, or patient becomes symptomatic, would
uptitrate the metoprolol and consider rehospitalization.
Coumadin was continued, however her INR was difficult to
maintain in the therapeutic range ([**2-1**]), so she briefly required
bridging with Lovenox. Unfortunately, there were several days
when she was not treated with a full dose of the Lovenox,
putting her at risk for atrial clots. We attempted a TEE with
cardioversion, however were unable to perform the TEE due to
difficulty monitoring the patient's O2 sats. The decision was
made to continue anticoagulation with Coumadin and perform an
outpatient cardioversion in [**3-1**] weeks. Someone from the
electrophysiology department at [**Hospital1 18**] will contact the patient
with details regarding this.
.
# Coagulopathy: INR was 4.2 on admission so Coumadin was held.
Coumadin was later restarted, however the INR drifted down to
1.6 on [**3-27**] so Lovenox was added. The INR increased to 3.1 on
[**4-2**] at which point Coumadin was again held. INR was 3.6 upon
discharge. We are continuing to hold the Coumadin for now. The
Lovenox has been stopped. Recommend following INR daily and
restarting Coumadin when INR drops below 3. Goal INR [**2-1**].
.
# CAD: Chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes wnl. Continued ASA, but
held lisinopril due to hyperkalemia.
.
# CHF: EF 40-45%. Euvolemic on exam. Holding lisinopril as noted
above. Started metoprolol as noted above.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Potassium has ranged from 5.3-5.9. Unclear
cause, though we are holding the patient's home lisinopril.
Serial EKGs have been negative for T wave changes and the
patient is asymptomatic.
