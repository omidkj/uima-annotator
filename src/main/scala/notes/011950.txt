Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2102-10-12**]:
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and mildly depressed global systolic function
(LVEF45-50%). The right ventricle is mildly dilated with
borderline normal systolic function.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta,
aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] leaflets. There is no aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral [**Month/Day/Year **] prolapse with systolic reversal of
flow in the pulmonary veins. The mitral [**Month/Day/Year **] leaflets are
myxomatous and severely redundant. There is prolapse of both
anterior and posterior mitral leaflets. The p1 and p2 portions
of the posterior mitral leaflet are flail with multiple ruptured
chordae visible.
The tricuspid [**Month/Day/Year **] leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid
annulus is dilated. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen.

Post-Bypass:
The anterior mitral leaflet now spans almost the entire mitral
annulus and an annular ring is seen, consistent with mitral
[**Month/Day/Year **] repair. There is no residual MR. [**First Name (Titles) 11718**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressure [**1-30**]
time is 90ms. Mitral [**Month/Day (2) **] peak/mean gradient is 5/2mmHg.
Calculated mitral [**Month/Day (2) **] area is 2.31cm2.
A tricuspid ring is seen, consistent with tricuspid repair.
There is trivial TR.
Left ventricular function remains mildly depressed with an
estimated EF of 45-50%.
There is no echocardiographic evidence of aortic dissection post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2102-10-12**] where
the patient underwent Mitral [**Date Range **] repair, Tricuspid [**Date Range **]
repair, Maze including left Atrial Appendage ligation.  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Coumadin was resumed for history of AFib and PE.  Chest tubes
and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  He was orthostatic on
POD 4 and medications were adjusted accordingly.  By the time of
discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
