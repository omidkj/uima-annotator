Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old
woman who had complaints of back pain and leg pain for two to
three days prior to admission.  She fell at home with
increasing confusion.  She was brought to the [**Hospital6 45215**] where a head computerized tomography scan showed
subarachnoid hemorrhage and she was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.  She
had a repeat head computerized tomography scan at [**Hospital6 1760**] which was positive for a
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  She went directly to angio where
she had an A1 aneurysm coiling.  She also has a left internal
carotid artery occlusion.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was monitored in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit post
procedure. On [**10-9**], she was weaned and extubated.  She
was moving all extremities.  She was restless while intubated
but sleeping comfortably post extubation.  She nodded her
head appropriately to questions.  She had a vent drain placed
at the time of the coiling.  Her intracranial pressure was 10
and her blood pressure was being controlled with Nipride.  On
[**10-11**], the patient was conversing but not totally
oriented, she does not know the year and month but knows the
family and answered questions appropriately.  The patient had
a repeat head computerized tomography scan on [**10-11**],
which is essentially unchanged, continues to show the
bifrontal hemorrhages with no extension and coiling of the
aneurysm.  The patient continued to do well neurologically
until [**2195-10-16**] when she was found to have right upper
extremity weakness.  She had a poor cough, was agitated and
fatigued and required reintubation at that point and was
brought back to angio where it was positive for vasospasm.
She was treated with Papaverine with effect.  She had a head
computerized tomography scan which showed no new bleed and
she was brought back to the neurological Intensive Care Unit
with improved neurological status post treatment of
vasospasm.  She remained unchanged with her blood pressure
160 to 180, right side still slightly weaker but moving all
extremities on the bed, very alert.  The patient was
extubated on [**2195-10-18**].  Chest PT was done.  She was
very congested and rhoncerous.  On [**10-19**], she developed
right-sided weakness again and she was less alert.  She went
back to Angio where she was also given Papaverine again.  She
was reintubated for Angio and remained intubated post
procedure.  Her blood pressure was labile, controlled on and
off Nipride.  She was moving all extremities to noxious
stimulation.  Her hematocrit was 26.  She was given 1 unit of
packed cells and her repeat hematocrit was 30.  We attempted
to extubate on [**2195-10-25**] but it was unsuccessful.  The
patient remained on a pressure support of 15.  She continued
to have vent draining at 20 cm above the tragus.  She was
alert but following commands, lethargic at times.
Computerized tomography scan on [**10-22**], showed no change.
She was on Labetalol to control her blood pressure.  On
[**2195-10-27**], the patient had an episode of congestive
heart failure, her central venous pressure went up to 29 and
SVP went up to 200.  She had crackles on the right lung
fields and left-sided exploratory wheezes.  She was given
Lasix.  Her positive end-expiratory pressure was increased to
7.5 with good effect, increasing her pO2.  On [**10-29**], the
patient was increasingly lethargic.  Neo drip was increased.
She had a stat head computerized tomography scan which was
unchanged.  Neo was off.  The patient sustained blood
pressure parameters without pressors.  She was given 1 unit
of packed cells for a low hematocrit.  [**2195-11-1**] the
patient had a brown guaiac positive stool, serial hematocrits
were done. The patient remained on CPAP with 5 of pressure
support, 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure.  She
continued with a moderate amount of thick secretions and the
patient continued to be diuresed, given 20 of Lasix
intravenously on [**11-1**].  Head dressing was intact.
Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.  She was
following commands.  On [**11-2**], the patient had an upper
gastrointestinal series which was consistent with coffee
ground aspirate, guaiac positive stool and epigastric pain.
Upper gastrointestinal series showed two gastric ulcers, not
actively bleeding at the gastric junction and a nonbleeding
longitudinal ulcer.  On [**2195-11-3**], the patient had her
tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
procedure without complications.  She continued to have
coffee ground aspirate.  She also had an abdominal ultrasound
which showed one stone in the neck of her gallbladder but no
cholecystitis.  Neurologically she continued to be alert,
nodding and mouthing words appropriately, moving all
extremities strongly.  Speech and swallow consult was ordered
to attempt p.o. intake.  On [**11-5**], the patient was
awake, alert and oriented to self, opens eyes to voice, able
to follow directions.  Pupils were 3 mm and brisk, able to
hold and lift all extremities off the bed.  Denies pain.  She
has a strong gag and cough reflex.  The patient was tested
for Helicobacter pylori which was negative.  On [**11-5**]
she had coagulase positive Staphylococcus in her sputum and
gram positive cocci.  The patient was treated with Oxacillin
for 14 days.  The patient had a repeat head computerized
tomography scan on [**2195-11-10**] which showed mild
ventricular dilation with no clinical hydrocephalus.
Continue to wean from the ventilator and will continue to
screen for rehabilitation.  The patient was awake and
attempted smiling, squeezing to command, moving all
extremities spontaneously but still vented.  The patient was
weaned from the ventilator on [**2195-11-10**].  She
tolerated it for 72 hours.  She was transferred to the
regular floor and then on [**2195-11-13**] she was
transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory
distress, continued on Oxacillin for her Staphylococcus
pneumonia and was placed back on a ventilator.  She was day
#10 of 14 of Oxacillin on [**2195-11-13**].  The patient had
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed on [**2195-11-14**].  Tube feedings were started.  She tolerated the
procedure well with no complications.  The patient remains on
a ventilator.  She continues to be awake, alert and oriented
times three, following commands, moving all extremities.  She
was continued on Oxacillin for her Staphylococcus pneumonia.
She had a bronchoscopy on [**2195-11-15**].  Bronchoscopy
showed copious secretions at the main carina and the right
and left main stem bronchi.  It also showed evidence of
pulmonary edema.  The patient was followed by physical
therapy and occupational therapy.  She remained on pressure
support of 10 with positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
