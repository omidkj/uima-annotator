Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
eval for liver transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**5-13**] EGD
R thoracotomy
LP done through IR


History of Present Illness:
45 yo m with h/o cryptogenic cirrhosis, end stage liver disease,
frequent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy exacerbations. He
presented on [**5-4**] to [**Hospital **] hospital after being found unconscious
[**12-18**] to missing a lactulose dose. He was given lactulose by NGT
in the ER and his mental status cleared. The patient underwent a
diagnostic tap in the ED there, but there was not sufficient
fluid to send to cell count. He was tapped again on [**5-6**] at OSH
and this tap showed increased cell count to 9045, 83% PNMs c/w
SBP therefore he was started on cefotaxime. The patient reported
blood in stools (patient thought this was from his hemorrhoids),
therefore he underwent an upper and lower endoscopy. Upper
showed grade I varices, gastropathy, and gastric varices. Lower
showed diverticulitis, polyp (not clipped [**12-18**] to increase INR),
and internal hemorrhoids. He was hypotensive after the procedure
to systolic of 80's (had been 120 - 150) which responded to
fluid boluses.  Also significant was the fact his Cr increased
from 1.8 to 2.6 during his short hospital stay, thought to be
due to acute renal failure [**12-18**] bowel prep vs. hepatorenal
syndrome. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for transplant eval on
[**5-6**].

At [**Hospital1 **]:

# End stage liver failure: The cause of his liver failure is
currently unknown and his MELD score was 30 on admission. He
underwent a workup for a liver transplant - echo, PFTs, viral
studies. He had multiple episodes of encephalopathy when not
taking lactulose. He was continued on lactulose while here.
Neomycin, which was started at RIH, was stopped for concern of
nephrotoxicity. His diuretics were held [**12-18**] low BP.  Pt.
scheduled for transplant but chest CT showed nodules (SEE lung
nodule hx below); intubated for surgery and weaned off on [**5-19**] in
SICU...transplant deferred.
.
# Acute renal failure: His baseline Cr was 1.5 - 1.8 and he has
had a sudden increase of his Cr from 1.8 -> 3.1 in a matter of 3
days. Of note, his Cr began to increase before he became
hypotensive and before any procedure was done at the OSH. This
is worrisome for hepatorenal failure exacerbated by infection
and intravascular volume depletion [**12-18**] to colonoscopy prep. He
was given 50mg of albumin x2 on admission and started on
octreotide and midodrine. and renal consulted; transfused for
improved forward flow and his creatinine improved.  On txf from
SICU, creat. trended down to 1.8.
.
# SBP: This was diagnosed on the day of admission at RIH and he
was started on cefotaxime there. He was switched to ceftriaxone
here. His cultures at RIH are currently not growing anything. He
was gently hydrated on the night of admission for concern that
his hypotension was [**12-18**] to infection (though he had a normal
lactate).  Switched from ceftriaxone to oral cipro for SBP
therapy ([**5-10**]) - to end on ([**5-22**])
.
# Hypotension/anemia: This is likely multifactorial . His
initial BP at the OSH was between 120 - 150 and decreased after
the colonoscopy. Perforation unlikely since has no pain.
Possibly [**12-18**] to SBP, volume depletion from colonoscopy prep, or
arterial and vasodilatation from HRS. on hospital day 2, his HCT
dropped from 25.7 on [**5-6**] to 18 on [**5-7**]. It was thought that he
was bleeding into his peritoneum from the paracentesis on [**5-6**]
or from his gastric varices. (He did not have abdominal pain,
vomiting, or BRBPR). His INR was 4.3 on [**5-7**] as well. He was
given 2 units PRBC and 2 units FFP for this HCT drop and
coagulopathy.  His BP on transfer from ICU.
.
# Rectal bleeding at OSH: The patient underwent a colonoscopy
and EGD on [**5-6**] that did not show evidence of active bleeding.
He does have gastric varices therefore at high risk for bleeding
event.  Resolved on transfer to medicine.
.
# Lung nodules - Chest CT on [**5-8**] showed scattered small
pulmonary opacities within both lungs, of varying sizes and
morphologies, suggestive of an acute infectious or inflammatory
process.  Bronchoscopy performed [**5-9**] - normal on visual
inspection, but BAL ctx grew out sensitive enterobacter and
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] sensitive to caspo/vori.  Tx c caspo c plan for
transplant after treatment of yeast infection in lungs.
Continue caspo * 2 weeks ([**5-18**]) with repeat CT to assess for
interval change.
.
# Panniculitis - tx c IV vancomycin.  Swab sent for MRSA screen
and pending; currently being treated with vancomycin.

IMPRESSION:  1. Scattered small pulmonary opacities within both
lungs, of varying sizes and morphologies, suggestive of an acute
infectious or inflammatory process. An additional area of
fibronodular thickening within the right lung apex may be
secondary to chronic lung disease, but could also be associated
with the above described smaller nodular opacities. Correlation
with the patient's clinical exam and follow up of these nodules,
to document their stability or resolution, is recommended. Given
the patient's history, a neoplastic process cannot be entirely
excluded.
2. New bilateral pleural effusions, smaller in size.
3. Prominent mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, none meeting
the size criteria for pathologic enlargement, which may related
to the above described process within the lung parenchyma.
4. Stable perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.
5. Gynecomastia.
