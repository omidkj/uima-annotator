CT Head: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal
extra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift. The
ventricles are normal, and the cisterns are patent. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter attenuation is normal. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No fracture
is detected.

CXR: The heart size is unchanged. The pulmonary vascularity is
within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are
unremarkable.

Abd US: The liver is diffusely coarsened in echotexture
consistent with cirrhosis. There is a tiny amount of ascites.
Spleen is not enlarged at 8.6 cm. The gallbladder is
decompressed. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary
dilatation, and the common bile duct measures 4 mm.
   Liver Doppler: There is reversal of flow within the portal
vein as well as the splenic vein. Normal flow and waveforms are
identified within the left and right hepatic arteries. The IVC
as well as the hepatic veins are dilated.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Syncope: her presenting complaint of syncope was most likely
[**3-17**] orthostatic hypotension, as supported by measurement of
orthostasis on admission and improvement in the pt's dizziness
after hydration, as below.  There was no cardiac arrhythmia on
telemetry, and the pt ruled out for MI by EKG and normal cardiac
enzymes.  The pt had no further dizziness or syncope during her
admission.  At d/c, she is at her baseline functional status.

2. GI bleed: the pt's HCT was noted to trend down over the 1st 2
hospital days.  She had guaiac positive stool, which was
concerning for slow GI bleed [**3-17**] portal gatropathy.  GI was
consulted and recommended colonoscopy after stabilization of the
pt's hypotension, as the bowel prep may exacerbate dehydration
and hypotension.  The pt's HCT stabilized after its initial
drop, and there was no evidence of active bleeding during the
rest of her hospital stay.  At d/c, there is no evidence of
active bleeding and the pt is advised to f/u with her PCP to
arrange colonoscopy in the near future.

3. Hypotension: the pt was hypotensive on admission w/ positive
orthostasis, indicating likely intravascular volume depletion in
the setting of total body fluid overload [**3-17**] cor pulmonale.  Her
cor pulmonale requires diuresis for treatment, but this was
limited during her admission by hypotension.  On the 2nd
hospital day, the pt became hypotensive w/ SBP in the 80s and
required multiple small fluid boluses (250cc each) to increase
SBP to 100s.  Given her tenuous fluid status, the pt was
transferred to the MICU for close monitoring and fluid
management.  During her short MICU stay, her SBP remained stable
in the 100-120 range, and she was then called out to the
Medicine service for ongoing care.  SBP remained stable
throughout the rest of her hospital stay.  At d/c, SBP remains
stable in the 120s.

4. Cor pulmonale: she has right heart failure [**3-17**] pulm HTN, not
responsive to NO on previous cath.  She was overall fluid
overloaded during her admission, but initially was
intravascularly depleted as above.  CHF service was consulted
for recs, and recommended gentle diuresis for treatment of RHF,
as limited only by BP.  Gentle diuresis was accomplished in the
hospital w/ lasix 40mg PO daily.  She will continue lasix after
d/c, and f/u in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic.

5. UTI: pt developed delirium during her hospital stay, which
was investigated with head CT and blood/urine cx.  Head CT was
normal, but UCX grew pan-sensitive enterococcus.  Her UTI was
treated w/ levaquin for a 7 day course, resulting in prompt
resolution of her delirium.  At d/c, there is no evidence of
active infxn and the pt is asymptomatic.

6. Anemia: workup of the pt's low presenting HCT demonstrated
low haptoglobin and elevated LDH, supporting a dx of hemolytic
anemia.  She had no schistocytes on peripheral smear, but had
many target cells most likely [**3-17**] liver dz.  Heme service was
consulted, and recommended Hb electrophoresis and outpt f/u in
[**Hospital **] clinic.  At d/c, Hb electrophoresis is pending.  The pt's
HCT is stable.  She will f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic after d/c.

7. DM2: controlled w/ outpt doses of NPH and lispro insulin
during this admission.

8. Asthma: controlled w/ advair and albuterol during this
admission.

9. Code status during this admission was full code.
