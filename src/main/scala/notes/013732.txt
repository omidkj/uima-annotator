Chief Complaint:
fever, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Peripherally inserted central venous catheter [**2113-7-31**]
-Repositioning of PEG tube by interventional radiology [**2113-8-3**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75yo Chinese-speaking F with PMH of dementia and
right sided prior stroke with residual left sided hemiparesis
who speaks only a few words at baseline, AF, diastolic heart
failure with mitral/tricuspid insufficiency, and diabetes. She
was brought in from [**Hospital **] Health Center where she is a
resident, for decreased responsiveness and fever since Monday.
Temp 102-103 at NH and patient not recognizing family members as
she typically does. CXray performed on [**7-24**] and again on [**7-29**]
which revealed no pulmonary disease.  Pt had labs remarkable for
elevated white count as well as very positive UA.  She was
restarted on PO cipro from [**Date range (1) 1163**] and then switched to
macrobid on [**7-28**].

Of note, pt was admitted most recently [**Date range (3) 8239**] for
Klebsiella UTI with bacteremia, course complicated by flash
pulmonary edema [**3-16**] to aggressive volume resuscitation in
setting of diastolic heart failure. She was d/ced on a course of
po cipro to end [**2113-7-18**]. She was also seen by speech and swallow
and failed; video swallow was recommended for further evaluation
to see if thickened liquids could be tolerated.

In the ED, initial VS were: T101 132 147/75 12 100%
She triggered in the ED for nursing concern and tacycardia to
the 130s. A foley was placed and there was gross yellow pus in
catheter. WBC 16.6 with 91.5% PMNs. Labs also notable for WBC
155, Cr 1.8, and lactate 2.7. She got 1L NS with plans for a
second, Zosyn, and Vacno. She also got PR acetaminopen x 1.
Prior to transfer, tele showing AF in the 120s-130s, 95% RA, BP
146/63.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. 101.4, 120s, 132/76, 93%.
Family states she has had no diarrhea, moved her bowels twice
yesterday after being constipated for two days. No CP, N/V,
abdominal pain.  No evidence of skin break down.  Family unclear
why she is not anticoagulated and stated that they do not
remember discussing this with physicians before.  They state
they have never discussed this before, although last d/c summary
notes this is due to her being a fall risk. Per family, pt's
diapers are not changed very often, and they have found her
sitting and even playing in her own stool.  They feel as this
may be contributing to her frequent UTIs.  Two weeks ago, was
starting to walk again to bathroom with assistance and walker.
