[**2165-11-19**] EKG
Sinus rhythm
Left bundle branch block with left axis deviation
No previous tracing available for comparison

[**2165-11-21**] CXR
Since [**11-19**], patient has been extubated and pleural and
midline drains have been removed. Lung volumes are lower, as
expected, with mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is no
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. A slight increase
in caliber of the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is
also a reflection of lower lung volumes. Tip of the right
jugular line projects over the course of the right internal
jugular vein at the thoracic inlet.

[**2165-11-15**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall and distal septum, The
distal inferior wall is near akinetic. The remaining segments
contract well. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2165-11-15**] Carotid Duplex
1. No evidence of significant atherosclerotic changes or
hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid arteries
bilaterally.
2. Nonvisualization of the right vertebral artery with normal in
appearance left vertebral artery.

[**2165-11-15**] X-ray
There is degenerative change with anterior osteophytes
throughout the cervical spine. C1 through the superior portion
of C7 are visualized on the lateral view. There is no evidence
of subluxation or malalignment. There is osteopenia and fused
facet joints secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-11-14**] for further
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up by
the cardiac surgical service in the usual preoperative manner. A
carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained which revealed no
evidence of significant atherosclerotic changes or
hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid arteries
bilaterally. The pulmonary service was consulted given his
history of COPD. His PFT's were obtained from [**Hospital3 45967**]
and smoking cessation was recommended. The rheumatology service
was consulted for his severe rheumatoid arthritis. X-rays were
obtained and NSAIDs were continued. On [**2165-11-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Postoperatively he was taken
to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit. On postoperative
day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was
extubated. He was transfused with red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. He slowly weaned from pressors. On
postoperative day three, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. Pacing wires were
removed and he started on plavix.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
Mt. [**Location (un) 33316**] on postoperative day 7. He will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as
an outpatient.
