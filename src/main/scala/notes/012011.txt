History of Present Illness:
75 y/o female with COPD, OSA, T2DM, HTN, CHF EF 40%, frequent
UTIs, CAD, and CKD who presented from her nursing home ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) with respiratory distress. Patient was initially admitted
through the ED when she developed increasing congestion,
shortness of breath, and somnolence. Patient visited by HCP on
[**Name (NI) 2974**], and was noted to have increased work of breathing. She
did not have cough, fevers, chills, chest pain, leg swelling, or
increased sputum at the time, and did not note nausea, vomiting,
or diarrhea. Per HCP, patient had a CXR done which was normal.
Patietn was seen again by her HCP the next day and was noted to
have worsening respiratory distress, and was given nebulizers by
nursing home staff. At the time patient was noted to be confused
as well, and was not alert to place, but did recognize her HCP.
[**Name (NI) **] HCP states that this is about her baseline. Patient recently
had Lasix and lisinopril discontinued by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also
with a recent UTI and was being treated with IV antibiotics.
Patient has stable orthopnea, lower extremity swelling. She is
not ambulatory at baseline. Her blood sugars have been stable.

In the ED, patient's initial VS: 99.9 BP 172/113 HR 110 O2sat
93%.  She received lasix 40 mg IV x1 and put out 600 cc urine,
and was originally on CPAP satting 99-100%. She was also started
on a heparin gtt for ACS based on elevated troponins, no EKG
changes. It is unclear why the patient was intubated, but
presumably for mental status changes. She was started on a nitro
gtt for blood pressure control and had a right subclavian line
placed for access.

Imaging
[**3-18**] CXR
With repositioning of the ET tube in standard position, the left
upper lobe consolidation has entirely cleared indicating that
this was atelectasis not pneumonia. There are, however,
substantial areas of consolidation in the left lower lobe and in
the right upper lobe marginating the major fissure in the
posterior segment that are quite likely pneumonia. Severe
cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pulmonary edema. The small
left pleural effusion is probably unchanged. Right central
venous line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial
junction and a nasogastric tube passes into the low stomach and
out of view. No pneumothorax.

[**3-18**] CT head
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU for
respiratory failure. Was thought to be a combination of
pneumonia, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, superimposed
on COPD exacerbation Was treated with empiric levofloxacin and
vancomycin, which was subsequently tailured to levofloxacin and
completed course. She also received a prednisone pulse with
taper, as well as aggresive inhaler therapy. She was
subsequently extubated and transferred to the floor without
further incident.

She was noted to be have acute renal failure, so aggressive
diuresis was not pursued. Her serum creatinine gradually
improved without intervention.

Initially, the patient was noted to hypertensive urgency, but
aggressive control of her blood pressure was accomplished
despite holding her ACE inhibitor in the setting of ARF. It was
not necessary to resume her ACE inhibitor on discharge to
control her blood pressure, but is recommended once her ARF
resolves.

Her urine culture was intially treated with the levofloxacin,
when identification and sensitivities returned, she was started
on Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam), dose for her kidney
function, for a total of 14 days. Her Foley catheter was also
exchanged. A PICC catheter was placed for the antibiotics.
