Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
58 year-old female with history of coronary artery disease
status post multiple stents, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
type II, deep venous thrombosis (no longer on coumadin), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperlididemia who presents from
[**Hospital1 **] with three episodes of bright red blood per rectum on
[**6-9**]. The patient's hemtocrit was 23 and she was transfused two
units packed red blood cells with repeat hematocrit only 25. She
noted associated lower abdominal discomfort. She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where she was noted to have melena in the
ED. Of note, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] for a
prolonged course for respiratory failure from parainfluenza
virus triggering a COPD exacerbation complicated by NSTEMI,
atrial fibrillation, and oliguric renal failure.
.
The patient was admitted to the MICU. Her baseline hematocrit is
21 per her [**Hospital1 2025**] admission note. In the MICU, the patient was
transfused three units packed red blood cells. She remained
hemodynamically stable and hematocrit remained stable. She
continued to have melanotic stools. She was seen by
Gastroenterology, who decline [**Hospital1 2792**] at this time as she
was stable and is less than three months from NSTEMI.
.
The patient states that she has occasional BRBPR every six
months. Her most recent [**Hospital1 2792**] was two years prior and
showed evidence of diverticula and hemorrhoids per the patient.
She is chronically on aspirin and Plavix as an outpatient. She
has had multiple episodes of diverticulitis before, but
otherwise denies melena, reflux, vomiting, epigastric pain. She
denies current chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness. She
does note fatigue.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCI (RCA stent x
4 after it was dissected during catheterization [**2115**], stent to
D1 [**2119**], stent to pRCA [**2121**], non drug-eluting stent to D1 [**2126**])

2. Status post recent admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] with respiratory failure
felt to be due to parainfluenza requiring intubation. Admission
complicated by renal failure requiring CVVH, creatinine now
normal and not on dialysis. Admission also complicated by NSTEMI
and atrial fibrillation broken by diltiazem; patient not on
coumadin.
3. Hypertension
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. Deep venous thrombosis in past
6. COPD
7. Diabetes mellitus type II
8. Diverticulitis
9. [**Hospital1 **] in [**2125**] significant for only diverticulosis and
hemorroids per patient; has never had EGD

Social History:
Married, lives at home with husband, although was at [**Name (NI) **]
prior to current admission after recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**].
30 pack-year smoking history. Denies alcohol, other drug use.

Family History:
Father had CAD, died of gastric cancer. Mother died from COPD.

Sinus rhythm, without diagnostic abnormality. No previous

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) PORT  [**2127-6-14**]
Lordotic positioning.
A left-sided PICC line is present. The tip is poorly delineated
as it overlies the vertebral bodies of the spine. I suspect that
it terminates in the position corresponding to the distal SVC,
but if clinically indicated, a repeat view may help to better
demonstrate this. The lungs are grossly clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old female with history of coronary artery disease
status post multiple stents, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
type II, deep venous thrombosis (no longer on coumadin), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperlipidemia who presents with
bright red blood per rectum and anemia.
.
1. Gastrointestinal bleed/anemia: The patient was transfused
three units packed red blood cells in the intensive care unit.
The patient's hematocrit then slowly trended down and she was
transfused four additional units of packed red cells in the days
prior to discharge. The patient did not have any further
episodes of bright red blood per rectum but had some episodes of
melanotic stool. The patient has a history of diverticulitis and
hemorrhoids, and most likely has a slow diverticular or
hemorrhoidal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation with
aspirin/plavix and subcutaneous heparin and in the setting of
recent prednisone use and recent hospitalization and intubation.
The patient had been recently constipated and was maintained on
a bowel regimen to prevent straining during bowel movements.
There was no nasogastric lavage performed in the Emergency
Department. The patient remained hemodynamically stable
throughout admission. The patient was followed by
Gastroenterology who felt that the patient did not need emergent
[**Month/Day/Year 2792**] as she was stable but would benefit from outpatient
[**Month/Day/Year 2792**] as they were reluctant to perform a [**Month/Day/Year 2792**] less
than three months from NSTEMI. The patient may also need an
upper endoscopy at that time for her history of anemia. The
patient's protonix was increased to twice daily dosing. The
patient's aspirin and anti-hypertensives were initially held but
restarted three days prior to discharge when after the patient's
hematocrit remained stable. The patient's aspirin was decreased
from 325 mg to 81 mg. The patient's plavix was not restarted as
it was greater than one year since the patient's last
percutaneous intervention. The patient should have her
hematocrit rechecked two to three times weekly and as clinically
indicated with transfusions for goal hematocrit 28-30 given her
recent cardiac event. The patient should follow-up with her
primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) 4120**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2792**] and potential upper
endoscopy in [**Month (only) 216**], three months from her cardiac event.
.
2. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia is from chronic
gastrointestinal losses as above. The patient appears to have a
history of chronic anemia. The patient's reticulocyte index was
low this admission. Iron studies were not obtained given the
patient's recent blood transfusions. The patient should have
further work-up as an outpatient, including iron studies,
[**Month (only) 2792**] as above, and likely upper endoscopy.
.
3. Coronary artery disease: There were no active issues during
admission. The patient's statin was continued. The patient's
aspirin and anti-hypertensives were initially held but restarted
three days prior to discharge when after the patient's
hematocrit remained stable. The patient's aspirin was decreased
from 325 mg to 81 mg. The patient's plavix was not restarted as
it was greater than one year since the patient's last
percutaneous intervention. The patient should have her
hematocrit rechecked two to three times weekly and as clinically
indicated with transfusions for goal hematocrit 28-30 given her
recent cardiac event.
