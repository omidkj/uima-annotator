Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
right blown pupil, slumped in the grocery store

History of Present Illness:
56 yo unknown handedness female with h/o DM, mechanical valve on
coumadin, afib who presents s/p slumping down in the grocery
store.  Her daughter was with her at the time.  At approximately
1:30pm she was walking in the grocery store when she slumped
down, lost consciousness and became unresponsive.  EMS intubated
her in the field, noted she had a blown right pupil, transferred
her to the [**Hospital1 18**] for furtherworkup. Per the family, she has been
feeling fatigued for several days, has had several episodes of
"feeling as though she may pass out" but never lost
consciousness.  + Family stressors.  No other symptomatology per
family - no fever/chills, CP, SOB, abdominal pain, headache,
nausea/vomiting, or other symptoms that the family is aware of.


Past Medical History:
1.  DM on PO meds and insulin prn
2.  Mitral valve replacement 6 yrs ago with [**Hospital3 9642**] valve at
[**Hospital1 2025**], secondary to damage from Rheumatic heart disease.
Cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17204**] at [**Hospital1 2025**].  Tricuspid valve repair
[**2169**].
?  Cardiologist records were faxed here.  [**Hospital3 **] makers faxed
a
statement saying their valves are MRI safe.
3.  Painful peripheral neuropathy for which she takes neurontin
4.  Hypothyroidism
5.  HTN vs. liver disease given nadolol on med list

Studies:

[**2172-6-11**] MRI/A:  IMPRESSION: Acute brainstem and right thalamic
infarct, due to vertebrobasilar occlusive disease.

CT angio [**2172-6-12**]:  1) Patient with known history of basilar
occlusion status post TPA, now with improved blood flow in the
basilar artery with persistent thrombus at the basilar tip.  2)
The right posterior cerebral artery is not well visualized and
overall caliber is small and irregular.  3) Hypoplastic left
distal vertebral artery with the dominant right vertebral artery
supplying the basilar artery. The remainder of the intracranial
circulation demonstrates no evidence of critical stenosis or
aneurysms.

TEE on [**2172-6-12**]:  Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated.
2. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately
depressed.
3. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular
gradients.
4. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A
tricuspid valve
annuloplasty ring is present.
5. No definitive cardiac source of embolism identified.

CXR (multiple):  LLL infiltrate, small pleural effusion

Sinus CT ([**6-30**]): IMPRESSION: Diffuse sinus opacification. With
the history of nasal packing
the significance of this finding is uncertain.

CT ABD ([**7-2**])IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of intra-abdominal
abscess or retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Patchy opacities at the left lung base with an area of
consolidation could
represent a pneumonic process.

MRI/MRA ([**7-9**]): IMPRESSION:

1. The MR study of the brain reveals evolution of the previously
seen
infarction involving the right thalamus, medial temporal, and
occipital lobes,
and cerebral peduncle with evidence of prior hemorrhagic
transformation.

2. Evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic infarcts, which are
unchanged.

3. Opacification of the paranasal sinuses, as seen previously on
the sinus CT
of [**2172-6-29**]. Since [**2172-6-12**], there is evidence of
bilateral fluid
accumulation in the mastoid air cells.

4. The MR angiogram shows restored basilar flow, but still no
left vertebral
artery flow.

CXR ([**7-21**]): IMPRESSION:

1) Tip of PICC is in the upper to mid SVC.
2) Stable cardiomegaly and mild CHF, with improvement in the
appearance of
pneumonia.
3) Small persistant opacity at the left hilum may represent
residual pneumonia
or prominent pulmonary vessels--followup to resolution is
suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE UNTIL [**2172-6-26**]:

56 yo woman with h/o mechanical valve and afib on coumadin,
subtheraputic, who presents with brainstem lesion findings on
exam, given t-PA in ED for suspected basilar artery occlusion.
MRI/A confirms this diagnosis. Occlusion likely secondary to
subtheraputic INR and clot from afib or mechanical valve.

1. For her stroke, she was admitted to the neuro ICU.  Her blood
pressure was mainated between SBP 130-150.  A head CT after the
tPA was obtained and showed no bleed.  A CT angio was obtained
which showed a partially reperfused basilar, still with some
clot at tip of the basilar. She was placed on heparin drip.  She
was started on a statin and recieved blood transfusions to
maintain a goal HCT>30.  A carotid duplex scan showed a right
60-69% stenosis, normal left ICA, left vertebral artery with no
flow, right vertebral artery is ok. She should have a f/u duplex
in 6 months.

2. During her admission to the Neuro-ICU she developed daily
temperature spikes to a max temp of 102.  Culture data obtained
and revealed MSSA in the sputum and LLL infiltrate on CXR.
Ceftriaxone was initially begun on [**6-14**] but her fever persisted,
so CTX was discontinued and zosyn was started on [**6-17**].  ID was
consulted as she remained persis
