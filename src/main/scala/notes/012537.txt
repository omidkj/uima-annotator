Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, respiratory distress, mitral
regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
86 yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
moderately severe mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary
hypertension, diastolic dysfunction and mild aortic stenosis
presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2189-9-29**] for palpitations.
According to the patient's family she complained of fatigue,
worsening dyspnea on exertion and cough for the three days prior
to admission.  She denied fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND, and
chest pain.

.

At [**Location (un) **], she was found to be in A fib with rapid ventricular
response.  In the ED, she was treated with DC cardioversion and
IV amiodarone.  Following DC cardioversion, the patient
developed respiratory arrest requiring intubation.  She was
found to have questionable infiltrate on CXR that was present
from admission.   Subsequently she developed sinus bradycardia
and hypotension, and was started on dopamine for pressor
support.  On [**2189-9-30**], she developed a junctional rhythm and the
amiodarone was discontinued.  At that time she was weaned off
propofol, however failed SBT.  Multiple attempts at weaning were
tried from that point on, but were unsuccessful.  She was
digoxin loaded on the 11th.  On the 12th, she went back into A
fib however without rapid ventricular response.  She was
extubated this AM and started on PO amiodarone.  She is being
transferred here for surgical evaluation of severe symptomatic
mitral regurgitation.

.

On review of systems, according to the patient's family she has
a prior history of stroke, she denies any prior history of TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.

.

On presentation, the patient is in atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response, hypotensive to the 60s systolic, and
unresponsive to verbal commands.

CXR [**10-6**]
Heart is mildly enlarged. Pulmonary interstitium is abnormal,
which could be
due to residual edema. Followup advised. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. ET tube and left internal jugular line are in
standard
placements. A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out
of view. No
pneumothorax. Upper most two sternal wires are fractured, but
not widely
displaced. I suggest the clinical inspection of the sternotomy
to exclude
instability or other complication.

Head CT [**10-7**]
1. No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or territorial vascular
infarction.
2. Region of encephalomalacia within the right occipital lobe
consistent with prior infarct.
3. Scattered punctate calcifications throughout the right
hemisphere
consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
4. Scattered calcifications within the basal ganglia
bilaterally.

Cardiac ECHO [**10-12**]
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is mild to
moderate aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. Mild-moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Probably mild/moderate aortic stenosis
([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2 cm2). Depressed left and right ventricular function (EF
40%). Complex atheroma in the descending aorta.

[**10-8**] Abd US
Limited study. Tiny right-sided pleural effusion. Otherwise,
unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.

[**10-12**] Unilateral UE US
Small nonocclusive thrombus seen within the right IJ at the
level
of the recent puncture. There is no pseudoaneurysm. No AV
fistula and no
hematoma identified.

[**10-15**] CXR:
NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Mild
cardiomegaly is stable. The sternal wires are aligned with
rupture of the first two wires as before, right peripheral
catheter tip is in unchanged position. There is no pneumothorax.
Bilateral increased interstitial marking is unchanged. No
evidence of new lung abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation
transferred from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest
and severe mitral regurg.  She was treated during this
hospitalization for her arrhythmia, respiratory failure and
mental status changes.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Pt was admitted with respiratory
distress thought to be secondary to over-sedation and also had
sputum growing GNR and CXR [**10-8**] shows evidence of LLL PNA. On
arrival, her blood gas was WNL however she was unable to
maintain her airway due to her mental status changes, therefore
she was urgently intubated, and successfully extubated on day 5
of the admission.  She was treated with 7-day course of
vanc-zosyn (completed on [**10-12**]) out of concern for pneumonia,
and provided with nebs and chest PT for supportive care.  She
was also diuresed out of concern for fluid over
