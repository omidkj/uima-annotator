Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14385**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o M with PMHx as noted below, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2125-11-28**] with hypoxia, hypotension, and
fever. The patient was living independently with his wife prior
to [**9-29**] when he sufferred a fall on coumadin which led to
bilateral SDH/SAH and a Right MCA stroke. The patient required
intubation during this first hospital stay secondary to
respiratory failure. He subsequently had a tracheostomy and PEG
placed. The patient developed a MRSA bacteremia and was started
on Vancomycin. He was discharged to [**Hospital 38**] rehab facility in
good condition after a month long hospital course. On [**2125-10-27**]
the patient returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for headaches and fevers. The
patient was found to have a reaccumulated subdural hematoma, a
temp to 103.8, and was started on vanc, ceftriaxone, flagyl,
(having had completed a fourteen day course of vanco on [**10-28**]
for MRSA pneumonia) switched to vanco, ceftaz, flagyl on [**11-1**]
to better cover pseudomonas after subdural hematoma evacuation.
The patient was subsequently found to have [**4-29**] blood cultures
positive for Vanco
resistent Enterococcus facecium and was started on linezolid.
Urine was negative for infection, chest x-ray showed likely
failure and possible pneumonia. The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2125-11-14**].

Two days prior to admission, the patient was noted to have
nausea and vomiting at the rehab facility. On [**2125-11-28**] the
patient had an episode of sudden desats, hypotension,
hypoglycemia with a FSBG of 50 and spiked a fever to 99.2. The
patient was brought to the ED via EMS. Upon arrival he was
started on levophed and given an amp of D50. He was empirically
started on Levo, Vanco, and Flagyl. A right subclavian line was
placed and a resulting pneumothorax was evacuated through right
chest tube placement. The patient was resuscitated with 4L IVF
and his urine output slowly increased. CXR showed a patchy LLL
opacity.

appearing with no-erythema or discharge

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2125-11-29**] 1:14 AM FINDINGS:

Again are noted bilateral subdural collections left greater than
right. These are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior
studies. There is persistent mild mass effect, also unchanged.
Hypodensities are seen in the periventricular white matter
consistent with small vessel ischemic disease. In addition,
there are hypodensities in the subcortical white matter
consistent with lacunar infarcts. There is no new acute
intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. Grey white matter
differentiation appears preserved.

ECHO Study Date of [**2125-11-29**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). No masses
or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

No definite vegetations seen. However, the absence of a
vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxic Resp Failure c/b Trach: It was thought the patient's
respiratory failure was most likely related to a LLL aspiration
PNA (vs chemical pneumonitis). The DDx also included PE but this
was considered unlikely since the patient has an IVC filter
(placed [**11-4**]). On presentation the patient was placed on AC
vent control. At the time of discharge he had successfully been
weened to trach mask. With a goal of Q3hour suctioning. A red
cap was able to be placed over the patient's trach. He could
potentially be decannulated at this time, but the presence of
the tracheostomy would facilitate assistance with ventilation if
the patient should require it. The decision to keep or remove
the trach should be left up to the family.

2. History of recent VRE: The patient was started on linezolid
and will require 2 additional weeks of therapy at the time of
discharge on [**12-12**] to complete a 6 week course. His platelets
will need to be closely monitored given his history of
myelodysplasia.

3. Fevers: The patient was initially treated for his likely
aspiration PNA with levo/flagyl. On HD #4, the patient spiked to
>101. His Left femoral line was d/c. Culture of the catheter tip
revealed growth of Klebsiella pneumo suceptible to zosyn but
resistant to levo. The pt was changed to zosyn and was treated
for 5 days. At the time of discharge the patient had been
afebrile for over 1 week.

4. CV: Hx of A fib with RVR and HTN. The patient had one episode
of a fib with spontaneous conversion to NSR after receiving
diltiazem. He will be discharged on metoprolol 100 mg TID. He
has an IVC filter in place. No Anti-coagulation given history of
multiple intracranial bleeds.

5. FEN: patient has tolerated tube feeds using his PEG
throughout his hospital stay. Daily monitoring of lytes with
repleation as necessary.
