Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
67 year old patient transferred from [**Hospital 25368**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital,
well known to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] heart failure service, hx of dilated
cardiomyopathy with an LVEF less than 10% and bioprosthetic
mitral valve replacement for severe MR, admitted to OSH on
[**2193-4-6**] with acidemia, SOB, hypotension, requiring intubation 3
days after admission. She was treated for CHF with IV lasix and
Milrinone. Transferred to step down floor on [**2193-4-14**] where she
went into respiratory distress, stridorous breath sounds (no
arrythmia). Required reintubation. Initially thought this was
due to heart failure but CVP was 2. Placed back on IV milrinone
and extubated two days later (on [**2193-4-16**]). Currently with sats
98-100% on 2 liters. Getting treated with antibiotics for UTI
and ? infiltrate on initial CXR. Also with stage I decubutis
ulcer on buttocks covered with duoderm.
.
Prior to transfer vitals were HR 70-90's AF with paced beats,
PVC's, BP 80/40-110/60, sats 98-100% on 2 liters, RR 20,
afebrile.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She does note some
swelling of her ankles. Also notes left pointer finger DIP pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
cannot assess dyspnea on exertion as pt has been bed-bound in
hospital, denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope. As above, ROS + for mild orthopnea, ankle
edema.

Social History:
Lives with her husband, has 2 adult children. Used to work as a

etoh, denies illicit drugs. Originally from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].

Family History:
There is no known family history of premature coronary artery
disease or sudden death. Sister had uterine cancer. Mother with
DM died of "[**Last Name **] problem."

Physical Exam:
Vitals - T , HR 70, BP 91/67, RR 20, O2 99% 2L NC
General - awake, alert, NAD
HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, OP clear
Neck - no carotid bruit b/l, no LAD, JVP at approx 10cm
CVS - Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in
the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no
thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a
normal S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs,
clicks or gallops.
Lungs - The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
Abd - The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There
was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft
nontender and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor,
cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or
carotid bruits.
Skin - Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed Stage I decubitus ulcer on buttocks, otherwise no
stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+


Pertinent Results:
TELEMETRY demonstrated: NSR at 70 bpm.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2192-11-1**] demonstrated:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-3-12**],
there is more tricuspid regurgitation. Otherwise, the findings
are similar.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2192-11-1**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed severe elevation of left
sided filling pressures with low cardiac index (wedge 34. CI
1.87). The right sided filing pressures were severely elevated
with RA of 13mmHg. There was pulmonary hypertension to 58/27.
With infusion of 1mcg/kg/min of nitroprusside the wedge fell to
19 with cardiac index up to 2.16. The PVR fell from 123 to 85.
The systemic blood pressure fell slightly from 107/57 to 89/50.
Dobutamine and milrinone were not used.
2. Patient transferred to CCU for tailored therapy.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe low output heart failure with elevated filling
pressures responsive to vasodilator.

Reports:
CXR upon admit to OSH: CHF, ? infiltrate
.
CXR on admission [**2193-4-18**]: Stable cardiomegaly, left base
atelectasis, no PTX, small left pleural effusion.
.
Cardiac cath [**2193-4-19**]: The right sided filling pressures were
mildly elevated.  The left sided filling pressures were severely
elevated.  There was moderate pulmonary hypertension. The
cardiac index was reduced.
.
TEE [**2193-4-19**]: Severe nearly static spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the left atrial appendage and there is probable thyombus
formation. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. There is right ventricular free wall is hypokinetic.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral
leaflets appear normal. The motion of the mitral valve
prosthetic leaflets appears normal. The transmitral gradient is
normal for this prosthesis (although gradient difficult to judge
in setting of low output state). Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is no
pericardial effusion.
