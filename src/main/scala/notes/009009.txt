HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male with a history of end stage cardiomyopathy and an
ejection fraction of 15% and a recent admission at [**Hospital6 11241**] on [**9-29**] to [**10-19**] with multiple episodes of
respiratory and cardia decompensation, requiring intubation
and pressors.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**]
nursing facility for further care and, over the past week, has
had increasing shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or syncope.  No light
headedness.  Question of mild fever although not documented
temperature.  No cough.

On the day of presentation, the patient had acute shortness of
breath and severe paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and three
pillow orthopnea.  The patient and wife went to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
[**Hospital3 2558**], also associated with [**Hospital3 4262**] Group and
had long discussion about the patient's goals.  The patient
was previously made DNR/DNI.  The patient hoped to go to [**Location 11206**] VA for further care of this acute crisis and possible
further discussion about hospice management and palliative
management of current complaints.  However, on transport with
EMS, the patient became hypotensive with systolic in the 80's;
diastolic pressure was not palpable by EMS; therefore, the
patient was taken to [**Hospital1 69**].  In
the Emergency Department, the patient was given one dose of 40
intravenous Lasix with good urinary output.  He was put on
Dopamine mom[**Name (NI) 11711**].  [**Name2 (NI) **] pressure increased to the 130's.
Heart rate began to have ectopy.  Dopamine was discontinued
within minute and [**Name2 (NI) **] pressure was sustained in the 130's.
The patient mentated well throughout the entire episode and
had no complaints.

Of note, the patient also reports that he has chronic diarrhea
over the last few weeks.  He received multiple antibiotics at
his last admission at [**Hospital1 69**].
He also was checked for Clostridium difficile at that point.
He was treated with Flagyl but was reportedly Clostridium
difficile negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease; status post
coronary artery bypass graft.  All information at outside
hospital.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 15%, documented in [**9-17**].  No other information available.
Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, unknown when.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on Coumadin, not known
why.  Chronic renal insufficiency, supposed baseline of 1.9.
Hypercholesterolemia.  Anion gap metabolic acidosis, ongoing
since [**Month (only) **].  The patient has received much magnesium and
bicarbonate at [**Hospital3 2558**] with unknown cause.  The patient
has a history of chronic abdominal pain.  Recently, he had an
exploratory laparotomy at [**Hospital1 69**]
to rule out mesenteric ischemia.  No abdominal processes were
found to be the cause of his abdominal pain.  However, cardia
hypoperfusion is presumed.

MEDICATIONS:
Digoxin 0.125 mg 1. day.
Captopril 12.5 three times a day.
Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
Loperamide 2 mg prn.
Roxanol 20 mg over 5 cc to be given prn.
Tylenol prn.
Dulcolax prn.
Multi-vitamins q. day.
Pureed regular nectar thick diet.

ALLERGIES:  Reports allergy to Quinidine and Proscar, unknown
response.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies any history of tobacco, illicit
drugs or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs on admission revealed:  Temperature 100.9, [**Hospital1 **]
pressure 120/90; heart rate 103; respiratory rate 28; 100%
saturation on non rebreather.  In general, he was alert,
oriented to place.  He was a very thin, cachectic looking
African-American male on a non rebreather with shallow
respiratory rate but overall pretty calm.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE & THROAT:  Anicteric with moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.  JVP was at the mandible at
45 degrees with diffuse point of maimal impulse, laterally
displaced.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate, occasionally tachy
rhythm.  Could not appreciate any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
RESPIRATORY:  Shallow tachypneic breathing.  No intercostal
retractions.  Crackl LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation
  Crackles half way up, left greater than the
ABDOMEN:  Scaphoid, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds.  No organomegaly appreciated.  Extremities were
cool, dry, withh lower extremities, due to presumed
vasoconstriction.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves 2 through 12
were grossly intact.  There were no gross deficits throughout.
Skin was dry without any rashes.  Stage II sacral decubitus
noted across the sacrum, approximately 4 by 8 cm with Duoderm
patch in place.  Access: The patient has triple lumen catheter
inserted in his groin by the Emergency Department.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  Potassium of 6.3; bicarbonate of 18;
creatinine of 1.9.  Troponin of .35. CK 134.  MB of 9. White
count of 7.2.  No shift.  Hematocrit of 34.  INR of 1.6.
Lactate of 4.3. [**Hospital1 **] cultures were drawn.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; Rate of 102; normal axis; regular low limb
lead voltage; left bundle branch block.  No ST or T wave
changes whatsoever.

Chest x-ray with a left effusion, very small.  Multiple
chamber enlargement.  Cephalization of the vessels and
increased vascularization.

Our impression initially was that this 76-year-old man with
respiratory compromise, likely due to congestive heart failure
exacerbation, ejection fraction of 15%.  Although it was not
presumed that there was an infectious cause, we figured that
we could not see an infiltrate on chest x-ray given the
congestive heart failure pattern.  The patient was given
Levofloxacin times one dose in the Emergency Department.  The
patient received Lasix diuresis until he put out 1.5 liters
over the first couple of days of admission.  Oxygen was
titrated down to two liters nasal cannula.  Ace inhibitor was
continued for after load reduction.  Digoxin level was checked
and found to be within normal limits.  Digoxin was continued.
The patient was weighed daily and had a [**2138**] liter fluid
restriction and a 2 gram sodium diet.  Within two days of
admission, the patient was breathing well on two liters of
nasal cannula, almost near his baseline per his reports and
per wife's reports.

Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
graft.  The patient was started on aspirin.  Lipids were
checked and found to be within normal limts so no statin was
started.  The patient was ruled out myocardial infarction.
Enzymes were cycled.  He was monitored on telemetry and was
noted to have ectopy and random premature ventricular
contractions but no concerning rhythm.  He had a history of
atrial fibrillation, now in sinus during this admission.  He
was continued on Digoxin.  He was given no rate control
despite his tachycardia, because it was thought that this was
cardiac output, given his low ejection fraction.  It was
unclear why the patient was not on Coumadin; however, once
reaching discussion about Palliative Care, it was determined
not to start this.

Metabolic acidosis without a gap.  The patient had a history
of this at [**Hospital1 69**] and at
[**Hospital3 2558**] per his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] saw him in
house at [**Hospital1 69**].  It was likely
due to his chronic diarrhea.  When the patient was hydrated
well and diuresed, bicarbonate level corrected.

Chronic renal insufficiency:  It was presumed that he was at
his baseline, even though no past records were available to
us.  He was given careful diuresis.  on day of discharge,
creatinine was 1.7.  Furea and FENa were both checked
throughout admission and were very low, consistent with being
a prerenal problem, consistent with poor cardiac output.

Hyperkalemia on admission, presumed to be due to metabolic
acidosis.  It was thought that it would be very unlikely that
it would be due to ace inhibitors.  The patient was given
[**Doctor First Name 233**]-Exalate.  Electrocardiograms were monitored.
Electrocardiograms throughout admission revealed no changes
from the
