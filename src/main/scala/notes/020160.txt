Abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea+vomiting

History of Present Illness:
38yo man with type I DM, CKD (baseline Cr 2.2-2.6, systolic and
diastolic CHF with EF 50-55%, refractory HTN and gastroparesis
with recurrent admissions for gastroparesis presented to new
PCP's office with recurrent nausea, vomiting, inability to take
pos and chest pain radiating to his back and was sent to ED. He
was last admitted 2 weeks ago with similar sx other than chest
pain, and was admitted for PNA and C. Diff. He states that he
has had abdominal pain and nausea/ vomiting over last week
similar to previous bouts of gastroparesis. He denies missing
any insulin doses and says he has been taking 10U at night, 4U
in evening with sugars <200 almost always. He finished [**Last Name (un) 8692**]
flagyl course, and had not had any diarrhea other than 1 episode
this AM.

In ED, initial vitals were significant for BP 250/140 and
glucose of 700 and a anion gap of 18 when corrected for
hyperglycemia. Pt. had CT without contrast to assess for
dissection given chest pain radiating to his back which was
negative. No leukocytosis, CXR and U/A negative, blood cx.
pending. He was placed on insulin gtt and received 40mg
labetalol with improvement of his BPs and resolution of his
chest pain. Initially, was to be sent to ICU, however no beds
available. As his sugars improved with insulin gtt and his his
AG closed, he is now admitted to the floor after transitioning
off insulin gtt since 3AM. He received 6U NPH 2h prior to
transfer and was actually hypoglycemic necessitating D50 X 1.

His ROS is significant for lack of cough. + CP, but
non-exertional, with no radiation and associated with abdominal
pain. No shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, LE edema. No
fevers or chills, though currently feels cold.

sat 98% RA
General: pale, thin man, shivering under covers, moaning
throughout exam.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, poor dentition, MMM
CV: RRR, no MRGs, no reproducible chest wall tenderness
Chest: CTAB, no wheezes, crackles
Abdomen: soft, ND, very mild TTP, to left of umbilicus without
rebound or guarding.
Extremities: 2+ DPs, no C/C/E
Neuro: CN II- XII intact, nl strength, sensation to LT.

Pertinent Results:
Chest - Two views are compared with the recent bedside study,
dated [**2131-3-16**]. There is patchy and somewhat nodular airspace
opacity involving the right upper lobe, predominantly its
anterior and apical segments, new. The lungs are otherwise
clear, with no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and pulmonary vessels are unchanged.
.
ECG: NSR with ST elevations ~ 1mm in V1-V3 c/w early
repolarization changes in anterior leads, V1 similar to
previous, v2-v3, sl. increased from priors.



Brief Hospital Course:
38yo type I diabetic with gastroparesis presents with chronic
sx. and DKA likely [**12-30**] medication nonadherence. Pt c/o chest
pain and found to have significant esophagitis. Then with acute
renal failure after cardiac catheterization to further
characterize chest pain (no significant CAD). Cr returned
towards baseline. Compliance with treatment plan and
appointments continues to be challenging and although patient
frustrated with his long hospital stay, he does not take active
role in his health care.

DKA: The patient originally presented with hyperglycemia.  No
evidence of ketones or acidosis.  He did have an anion gap with
closed quickly with IVFs and insulin gtt.  He was quickly
transitioned to SQ insulin.  There was no evidence of infection.
His blood sugars were difficult to control throughout his
hosptital stay in part because he was frequently NPO for
proceedures. He was followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consult
service. He was treated with NPH and a gentle SSI. Discharging
him with NPH and a sliding scale was discussed, but the patient
noted that he was legally blind and only able to read his
Innolet disc and would not be able to draw up syringes. He will
f/u with [**Last Name (un) **].
.
Hypoglycemia/Hypothermia: after receiving full insulin dose
while NPO and undergoing stress test, the patient experienced an
episode of hypoglycemia, confusion, diaphoresis, hypothermia to
91.9 and sinus bradycardia. He was transferred briefly to the
ICU for monitoring, but once his glucose was corrected, the
other issues also resolved shortly thereafter. He was
transferred back to the floor the following day.
.
N/V/abd pain:  This was thought secondary to his known
gastroparesis and was similar in nature to his prior episodes.
He was started on RTC antiemetics and pain control as needed. He
was transitioned from IV to PO dilauded. It was difficult to
assess his abd pain as it was both LUQ, epigastric and
substernal and radiated to the left shoulder. CT abd in the ED
showed a thickend esophagus. He was evaluated with an EGD which
showed severe esophagitis, gastritis and a soft food bezoar all
of which were though to be due to gastroparesis and reflux. His
antacid regimen was increased to PPI [**Hospital1 **]. He was also placed on
a liquid diet to facilitate the resolution of the bezoar and
improve his gastroparesis. H.pylori serology was negative.
Pathology showed...Per GI consult recomendation, erythmocyin was
stopped as PO erythromycin has no effect on gastroparesis and as
IV erythromycin has limited effect due to tachyphylaxis. In
addition, there was a concern for risk of prolonged QT when he
became bradycardic.
.
Chest Pain: In the ED, a CT was negative for dissection.  He was
ruled out by cardiac enzymes.  He was seen by cardiology on the
floor who felt that given his numerous risk factors he should
have a stress test.  Given his baseline abnormal EKG a stress
MIBI was performed, during which he had chest pain - although he
had CP prior,during and after the test as well.  At level of
exercise achieved (only 37% of age-predicted maximum), there
were no myocardial perfusion defects, however, depressed LVEF
(38%) and global hypokinesis. He then received a dobutamine
echo. The patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at
15 mcg/kg/min. The blood pressure response to stress was
abnormal/mildly hypertensive. Resting images demonstrated
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the posterior wall. At low dose dobutamine [15mcg/kg/min;
heart rate 68 bpm, blood pressure 210/100 mmHg), there was
global hypokinesis and no reduction of cavity size; however,
there was also concerning LV ballooning and inducible ishemia.
Because of these results, he was thought to be high cardiac risk
and was kept in house for cardic catheterization. The
significiant risk of kidney failure and life-long dialysis was
discussed prior to cardiac catheterization. The patient decided
to undergo the risk with full informed consent. Cardiac
