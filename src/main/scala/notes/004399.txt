had + palpitations but no chest pain. She also reports cough
with no sputum production x 3 days; denies any fevers/chills or
night sweats. Denies sick contacts. Denies PND or orthopnea.

Studies
Echo [**2155-8-2**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction (pseudonormal left ventricular inflow Doppler
spectrum). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2153-8-13**], the findings are
similar. The left ventricle is hypertrophic and displays reduced
diastolic compliance.
.
CXR [**2155-8-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema, confluent right lower lobe
opacity
could represent developing alveolar edema or pneumonia. Severe
cardiomegaly.
.
CXR [**2155-8-6**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-4**] and 29:

Mild pulmonary edema continues to improve. Severe cardiomegaly
including
large left atrium is stable. The lungs clear of any focal
abnormality. No
pleural effusion. Mild rightward displacement and indentation of
the trachea at the thoracic inlet, suggesting an enlarged left
thyroid lobe, has been a constant feature since [**2153**].
.
EKG [**2155-8-2**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the
previous
tracing of [**2153-8-13**] the lateral ST segment depression with T wave
inversion
is less pronunced and the ventricular rate is faster.

EKG [**2155-8-8**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and
ventricular premature beats or aberrant ventricular conduction.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2155-8-5**] the rate
has increased. The other findings are similar.

Negative

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:82 yo female with h/o CHF, A.fibb, CAD who presents with
progressive SOB & palpitations and found to have CHF
exacerbation [**2-8**] a.fib with RVR.

1. Respiratory Distress- Etiology is likely secondary to CHF
exacerbation triggered by a.fibb w/RVR as well as COPD.
Initially, pneumonia was considered as a possibility and the
patient received a dose of Levaquin in the ED, however, given
the improvement in the patient's clinical status after diuresis
with IV Lasix, it is unlikely that the pt's resp distress was
secondary to an infectious etiology.  The patient required
admission to the ICU and the use of BiPAP. She was kept at -1000
cc/day net fluid balance.  She was rate controlled as below and
given nebulizer treatments.  Her oxygen saturation was fine on
room air and when ambulating on the day of discharge.  She was
discharged on tiotropium bromide, fluticosone, levalbuterol, and
her home dose of lasix.
.
2. CHF- Most recent ECHO in '[**53**] showed EF 55% wtih preserved
systolic function however the patient had clear evidence of
pulmonary edema on CXR. Pt has been diuresed with Lasix and
nitro with improvement. Exacerbation likely occured in setting
of afib with RVR.  She was discharged on her home dose of lasix.
 The following medications were changed in dose: metoprolol to
100mg PO BID, Verapamil to 80mg PO TID, and Quinapril 20mg PO
BID.
.
3. Rhythm- The patient
