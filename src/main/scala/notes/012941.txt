[**2157-6-3**] Video Swallow study
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88075**] was a 41 year old man with diabetes, HCV, & EtOH
cirrhosis, ESRD on HD that presented with Klebsiella pneumoniae
pneumonia secondary to aspiration.

#. Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia
Patient presented from rehab with fever, cough, and relative
hypoxia. In the ER, he was placed unnecessarily on a
non-rebreather mask on admission requiring a brief stay in the
MICU for less than 24 hours. CXR did not show discrete
infiltrate but multi-focal airspace disease present from likely
aspiration. He also had leukocytosis. After initiation of
broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin, zosyn, and
levofloxacin ([**5-23**] - [**5-27**]), he became afebrile and did not
have an oxygen requirement. His antibiotics were narrowed to
ceftriaxone ([**Date range (1) 88082**]) and he completed a 7-day antibiotic
course with resolution of resipratory symptoms.

# Abdominal pain
Patient reporting RUQ abdominal pain associated with nausea
during hospitalization. Physical exam significant for an
enlarged abdomen from ascites. RUQ did not suggest hepatobiliary
process such as gallbladder disease. Subsequently, a therapeutic
paracentesis was performed with alleviation of the pain.

# Malnutrition/Failure to thrive:
The patient is failing to thrive secondary to poor nutrition and
underlying hepatic disease. He was continued on tube feeds (see
discharge diet). Speech and swallow evaluated patient and
recommended STRICT NPO given the location of his pneumonia and
his high risk for aspiration. The patient was frustrated but
understood the reasons and rationale. He underwent filler
injection to larynx at MEEI durring admission with subsequent
improvent in phonation and aspiration risk profile. Subsequent
video swallow study did not reveal evidence or risk of
aspiration. He was discharged on a thin liquid and soft solid
diet in addition to tube feeding.

# Alcohol and HCV cirrhosis:
Complicated by ascites, grade II esophageal varices, and hepatic
encephalopathy. He did not display encephalopathy during
hospitalization given effective route by NGT ensuring medication
administration. He was continued on lactulose and flagyl with
the latter replacing rifaximin, which has resulted in tube feed
clogs. SBP prophylaxis was held while on broad spectrum
antibiotics but continued at discharge rifaximin replaced with
flagyl because it can clog the tube. He was also continued on
nadolol for portal hypertension and grade II varices.

#. Depression and Anxiety
He was continued on paxil and remeron.

#. End-Stage Renal Disease on HD:
He was mantained on HD as an inpatient and will continue on TTS
schedule.

# Phonation:
Patient has been evaluated by ENT in past with vocal cord issues
resulting in muffled voice. He underwent filler injection to
larynx at MEEI durring admission with subsequent improvent in
phonation and aspiration risk profile. He should follow-up with
ENT as an outpatient.

#. Asthma:
He was continued on fluticasone and albuterol nebulizers. If he
should have recurrent pneumonia, his inhaled steroid dose should
be decreased.

#. Lower Back Pain:
He was continued on oxycodone as needed for back pain.

#. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
He was continued on sliding scale insulin.

#. Neurotrophic Corneal Abrasion:
His left eye appears white. He has outpatient follow-up with an
oculoplastic surgeon.
