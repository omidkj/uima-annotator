Chief Complaint:
CC: Emesis, diarrhea, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt. is a 76 yo female with a history of ESRD on HD, CAD,
atrial fibrillation, and DM2 who presents with a 1 day history
of 3 episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious, clear emesis and 1
episode of nonbloody diarrhea.  The patient woke up in her USOH
this AM when she suddenly developed 3 episodes of emesis and 1
episode of diarrhea.  She reports that she did not eat breakfast
this morning, and has had no change in her diet.  She has a sick
contact: a next door neighbor in rehab had vomiting and diarrhea
recently.  She denies abdominal pain/cramping, chest pain,
palpitations, SOB, dysphagia, cough, sore throat, HA, dysuria,
neck stiffness.   She does report passing gas.  She has been
tolerating PO food and fluid.  Of note, she was discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] [**2124-9-8**] for an UGIB [**1-7**] PUD so has been off Coumadin.  On
the day of admission she finished treatment for H. pylori
(Clarithromycin, Flagyl, and PPI), which she reports giving her
a sour taste in her mouth.
.
In the ED, her vital signs were temp 100.1, HR 88, bp 160/71, RR
18, SaO2 100% on RA.  The patient was given lunch in the ED.
She had an EKG which showed NSR, [**Month/Day (2) **] in I, aVL, no ST changes.
CT abdomen/pelvis, CXR, and abdominal films were negative for
acute disease.  WBC 12.1 -> 7.9.  Troponin 0.32 -> 0.26, CK 61
-> 50, and the patient was admitted for further work-up and to
r/o MI.
.
On the floor, the patient continued to have no symptoms and
reported no pain.  She remained febrile to 102.2 and tachycardic
to 120.  She was given IVF NS 500 cc bolus x1, and her SBP
became 90.  She then received IVF NS 500 cc bolus x2, but her
SBP remained 85.  No EKG changes.  MICU was called for
evaluation for transfer.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of obstruction or acute intra-abdominal
pathology.
2.  Right-sided renal lesion concerning for carcinoma and not
completely characterized on this single phase of contrast study.
MRI is recommend for further evaluation.
3.  Bilateral healing pelvic fractures, one of which involves
the left
acetabulum.
4.  9 mm partially calcified splenic artery aneurysm.
.
CXR ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and
associated atelectasis.  No infiltrate or evidence of pulmonary
edema.
.
Abdomen Films ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION:  Subacute fractures of right
superior and inferior pubic rami; no evidence of obstruction or
free air.
.
EKG: NSR, No [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevation in V2, ST depression in V6
(noncontiguous)
.
Renal U/S ([**9-21**]): IMPRESSION:
Mixed solid and cystic right interpolar renal lesion as noted on
CT examination. Findings are still concerning for neoplastic
involvement and dedicated MRI examination is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo female with a history of ESRD on HD, CAD, atrial
fibrillation, and DM2 who presents with a 1 day history of
vomiting and diarrhea.
.
# Fever.  Patient presented with a 1 day history of emesis and
diarrhea, with a temperature of 100.1.  CT abd/pelvis was
without evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology, CXR was
without evidence of infiltrate, and abdominal film was without
free air.  WBC was initially 12.1 with a left shift, and lactate
0.8.  The patient was transferred to the MICU on the day of
admission for fever up to 102.2 and hypotension; in the ICU the
fever defervesced without antibiotics and she remained afebrile.
 She most likely had a viral gastroenteritis causing her
symptoms. Patient was also tachycardic, which was likely a
response to fever or dehydration, as patient denied any pain.
Blood cultures taken at that time were with no growth.
(UA/urine Cx not able to be done as patient makes minimal
urine.)  C. difficile toxin was negative x 3.  Fecal culture
negative for salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter.  Diarrhea
resolved spontaneously without intervention prior to discharge.
.
# Hypotension:  On admission, she had fever and hypotension down
to 88/40.  She was given IVF NS 500 cc bolus x2 without initial
improvement in her BP.  She was transferred to the MICU, where
her BP incrased up to 110s.  She was transferred back from MICU
with SBP up to 110s.  The patient also developed hypotension
down to SBP in the 70s during 3 HD sessions when given IV
lopressor and IV diltiazem for treatment of a fib with RVR into
140s-170s (see below).
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient initially in NSR on admission.
Patient has a [**Company 1543**] dual chamber ICD, followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11679**] at [**Hospital1 112**].  Her Coumadin is being held for at least 1 month
pending GI f/u s/p UGIB at the beginning of [**9-10**]. She was
continued on ASA 81 daily.  Beta blocker was initially held when
patient was hypotensive.  Outpatient Metoprolol dose was
initially continued at 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] qMWF, 25 mg qhs qTuThSa.
However, she was developing a fib with RVR into 140s-170s with
HD, but this was increased to metoprolol 25 PO bid for better HR
control. The patient developed afib with RVR at 3HD sessions,
treated with IV Lopressor
