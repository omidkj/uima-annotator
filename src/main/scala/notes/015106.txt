Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**MD Number(1) 4158**]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Acetabular fracture, posterior wall,
significantly comminuted.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Acetabular fracture, posterior
wall, significantly comminuted.

PROCEDURE:  Open reduction internal fixation of left
posterior wall acetabular fracture.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is a 65 year-
old gentleman who was involved in a motor vehicle accident,
resulting in the above injury. He now presents for operative
fixation.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:  This is an extremely difficult case.
The posterior wall was comminuted in at least 5 major parts
with significant amounts of moderate impaction requiring
subchondral grafting.  The case merits billing under modified
22 considerations. The case was made difficult given the
amount of comminution and need for impaction grafting and the
need for double plating of the posterior wall, in addition to
placement of lag screws to secure fixation.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the
operating room and after successful induction of general
anesthesia, he was placed in the supine position and then
transferred to the lateral decubitus position with the left
side up.  After prepping and draping the gluteal region and
leg, the fracture was exposed via a [**Doctor Last Name **] approach.  The
external rotators were identified, tagged and cut. The
quadratus was preserved.  The sciatic nerve was visualized
and protected throughout the procedure by keeping the knee
flexed and the hip extended.  There were significant amounts
of hematoma given the dislocated nature of the joint during
the trauma. The fracture fragments of the posterior wall were
identified and were found to be numerous.  They were
preserved with their attachments in order to preserve the
vascularity.  The amount of clot and interposed soft tissue
was aggressively debrided and the wound was lavaged with
pulsed irrigation. There were significant amounts of
longitudinal impaction which was elevated with a [**Doctor Last Name **] and
then grafted with 30 cc of cancellous chips.  Single layer of
fracture fragments were reduced and held in position with K
wires and then with lag screws of the 3.5 mm cortical
variety.  Subsequently, two 3.5 mm reconstruction plates were
contoured and applied to the posterior wall in a buttress
manner.  Fluoroscopy in the AP as well as oblique and
anteriorly were used to confirm that the fixation was
appropriate.  No screws were angled into the joint.  The
patient's range of motion and stability was acceptable. The
wound was then copiously irrigated and closed in layers with
Vicryl sutures.  Ethibond sutures were used to repair the
external rotators.  Staples were placed in the skin. The
wound was covered with sterile dressings. The patient will be
given postoperative precautions and touch-down weight bearing
only.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was present for the entire procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] presented to the emergency department from an
outside hospital s/p MVA as an unrestrained passenger. He was
evaluated by the Orthopaedics department and found to have a
fracture to his left posterior acetabular wall, C6-6 vertebral
body Fx and C7 facet and lamina Fxs. The hip was internally
reduced in the ED. She was then admitted and consented for
surgery. On [**2133-5-29**], he was prepped and brought down to the
operating room for surgery to his left lower extremity.
Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively, he was
extubated and transferred to the PACU for further stabilization
and monitoring. He was then transferred to the floor for further
recovery. On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with
his pain controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to
improve his strength and mobility. He continues to make steady
progress without any incidents. He was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility in stable condition. He was instructed
to call Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] offices at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**]
for a follow up appointments in 2 weeks.
