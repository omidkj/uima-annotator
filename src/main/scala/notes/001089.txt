HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 17811**] is a 38-year-old
female who originally had a lesion in the mid-sigmoid region,
which had been diagnosed as a diverticulitis.  For this she
underwent a cecostomy.  Postoperatively she underwent a
colonoscopy.  However, the scope could not pass through and
biopsy revealed a carcinoma.  A CT scan performed at this
hospital prior to surgery revealed no evidence of any
liver metastasis and a barium enema still showed an
obstructing lesion in the sigmoid.  The gastrografin through
the cecostomy showed multiple large amounts of stool
collection without obvious lesions.  Of note, is that in the
past the patient was difficult to intubate/extubate and she
is status post repair of the cleft palate a long time ago.
It was felt that a subtotal colectomy of this obstructing
lesion would be appropriate, since it was difficult to prep
the bowel.   We discussed with the mother and the patient at
the time the benefit of getting rid of the cecostomy, which
was poorly functioning with skin complications.

PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Colon cancer.
2.  Cecostomy performed for obstructing diverticulitis.
3.  Palate reconstruction.
4.  Tracheal stenosis.
5.  Hearing impairment.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of tobacco use.  No history of
alcohol or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.4, heart rate 68, blood
pressure 134/56, respiratory rate 20.  95% on room air.
General:  Alert and oriented in no acute distress.  Young
female.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam within normal
limits.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen soft,
nontender.  Cecostomy present.  Bowel sounds present.  Rectal
exam is within normal limits.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
General Surgery service.  On [**2114-12-23**] she underwent subtotal
colectomy and take down of the cecostomy.  She tolerated the
procedure well.  There were no complications.  Please see the
full operative note for detail.  She remained intubated and
was kept in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, then transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit.  She was maintained on
intravenous fluids.  Her white count decreased.  An attempt
was made to extubate the patient, however, there was no cuff
leak and she did not tolerate it, requiring re-intubation.
Her hematocrit was noted to decrease and she was transfused
with packed red blood cells.

Otolaryngology was consulted and a CT scan of the neck was
done showing single enlarged left paratracheal lymph node,
numerous small lymph nodes throughout mediastinum and neck,
left lower lobe collapse and left pleural effusion as well as
incidental node of right aortic arch with possible apparent
left subclavian artery.  The ENT service also did a
fiberscopic study, showing abnormal abduction of the vocal
cords and also a narrowing.

The patient was started on tube feeds and also
transparenteral nutrition.  She spiked a fever to 103.7 with
blood cultures positive for staph aureus as well as the
central line tip.  She was started on Vancomycin, Levaquin
and Flagyl.  The patient continued to improve however.
Unfortunately she failed a second extubation attempt and
there still was no cuff leak.  As a result on [**2115-1-3**] the
patient underwent tracheostomy.  She tolerated the procedure
well.  She was eventually transferred to the regular floor.
She continued to receive tracheostomy care as instructed.
She received an antibiotic course for a pneumonia diagnosed
on scan.

She had a clot in the left internal jugular vein.  A PICC
line was placed on the other side and the central line was
removed.  A repeat ultrasound of the internal jugular vein
showed partial resolution of the clot in the left internal
jugular.  She was started on Lovenox 60 mg twice a day
injections.  She was having diarrhea but C. difficile stool
test remained negative.  A swallow examination was performed
and the patient was thought to be able to tolerate regular
consistency diet.  A Passy/Muir valve was placed.  She was
started on clear liquids and advanced to a regular diet which
she tolerated well.  The tube feeds were discontinued and
feeding tube was removed.  The TPN was stopped.  She was
ambulating without difficulty.  She remained afebrile.

Physical therapy consult recommended [**Hospital 3058**]
rehabilitation.  The patient was discharged on [**2115-1-14**].
