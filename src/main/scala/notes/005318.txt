Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea - Transfer to MICU for Hypoxia

PICC line placement
Right pigtail pleural catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80 year-old female with h/o Sjogren's syndrome, IBS,
who presents with diarrhea and fever. Patietn starting having
non-bloody, watery diarreha approximately three weeks ago. This
has been persistent since that time. For the past several days,
she has been experiencing crampy b/l lower quadrant abdominal
pain and distension. Today she developed subjective fever and
rigors at home. Denies nausea, vomiting, dysuria. Decreased
appetite over same time course.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5 125 111/63 22 100%. Patient
AAOx3. Subsequently febrile to 101.0. Exam remarkable for mild
discomfort to palpation in RLQ/LLQ. Labs notable for WBC 20.2
with 93.6% PMNs (no bands), Na 127, lactate 2.2, normal LFTs. UA
showed 5 hyaline casts, no mucus/WBC/RBC etc. BCx and UCx drawn.
CT [**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis with contrast showed pancolitis without
perforation or obstruction, intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation
and prominent CBD, right lung base consolidation. CXR showed
bibasilar opacities +/- pulm edema and multiple dilated small
bowel loops. Patient given 2L NS, 2L LR, IV Cipro, IV Flagyl and
Tylenol. Patient was initially admitted to medicine floor, but
developed hypoxia while in ED and had new 5L O2 requirement. She
had a repeat CXR showing possible pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema.
She received ceftriaxone for possible pneumonia and was
transferred to MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient appears uncomfortable and is
rigoring. She reports crampy abdominal pain in her lower
abdomen, fevers, and rigors. She continues to have diarrhea, but
no nausea or vomiting. Mild cough productive of white sputum. Of
note, patient last received antibiotics in [**2186-11-19**]
(azithromycin for CAP).
.

Imaging:
CT Abd/Plevis with Contrast ([**2187-4-2**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse colonic mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel wall
thickening is
consistent with pancolitis.
2.  Ground-glass opacities within the right middle and right
lower lobes
compatible with acute infection and/or aspiration.  Possible
mild pulmonary
edema.
3.  Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and prominence of the
common bile and pancreatic ducts could be better characterized
with non-emergent MRCP.

CXR ([**2187-4-2**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bibasilar opacities would be consistent with pneumonia
and/or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Likely some
component of pulmonary edema given the interstitial thickening.
2.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel may represent ileus or
obstruction. Dedicated abdominal radiograph may be performed for
better characterization.

ECHO ([**2187-4-3**]):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis
(mean gradient XXmmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild
to moderate ([**11-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is se
