History of Present Illness:
45F s/p patient status post TVT obturator procedure at [**Hospital1 **] [**2124-3-22**] states she began to have thigh pain 3 days after

thrive and was found to be hypotensive in the 70s. After 6
liters of fluid and doses of Vancomycin, imipenem, and
clindamycin her
blood pressure returned to her norm (SBP 90s). By report the
patient also had fevers at home.

Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
[**4-4**] C/A/P CT with contrast:(PRELIM) Moderate bilateral pleural
effusions with septal thickening seen throughout the lungs
compatible with pulmonary edema. Diffuse bowel wall thickening
and edema, involving both small and large bowel loops with
marked
mucosal hyperenhancement, suggestive of shock bowel. Diffuse
periportal edema with new moderate ascites. Wedge shaped area of
low attenuation in the right kidney (2:63), may
reflect an infarct. Heterogeneous enhancement pattern of the
spleen, likely moire pattern from contrast timing. New locules
of
air in the right groin, with wound in the medial thighs
bilaterally, likely reflect post-surgical changes following
exploration. Anasarca.

[**2124-4-11**] CT A/P
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease in size of pleural effusion and ascites.
2. Interlobular septal thickening and patchy consolidation at
both lung
bases. Findings consistent with pulmonary edema and superimposed
pneumonia.
3. Foci of low attenuation in the spleen could represent small
parenchymal
infarcts.
4. Fluid within the intermuscular fascia and muscles of the
medial
compartment of both thighs has slightly increased in comparison
to the prior scan, but no new areas of gas are seen with the
muscles or subcutaneous tissues.
Echocardiogram [**2124-4-7**]
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-4-5**],
the findings are similar. LV systolic function may have been
slightly underestimated on the prior study.
Pathology: [**2124-4-12**] skin and soft tissue :
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Right thigh, skin and subcutaneous tissue (A-B):
Skin with ulceration and subcutaneous tissue with acute
inflammation, fat necrosis and focal abscess formation.
II.  Right thigh, fascia (C):
Gangrenous necrosis of soft tissue.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency room on [**4-4**] in septic
shock.  She was given 6 L IVF and 1 dose of vancomycin,
clindamycin, and imipenem prophylactically for concern for
septic shock with necrotizing fascitis. A central line was
placed and
both surgery and GYN were consulted. GYN noted nl pelvic exam
with well healed TVT incision. CT imaging confirmed soft tissue
infection to b/l thighs extending to femur and thus it was
decided to take the pt to the OR urgently for emergent
exploration and removal of her TVT.  In the OR, it was
discovered that pt had completely viable fascia and tissue with
no necrosis. A minimal amount of pus was found in the R. inner
thigh which was sent for culture. Pt was continued on IV
vancomycin, clindamycin, and meropenem.  She was admitted to the
ICU where she was on 2 vasopressors and in acute renal failure
and was initiated on CVVH. She received a repeat pan CT with
contrast notable for shock liver, shock bowel, and R. kidney
infarct.  She remained intubated, sedated on midazolam and
fentanyl.
