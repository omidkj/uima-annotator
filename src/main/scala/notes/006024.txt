         Confirmation should be requested in cases of treatment
failure in
         life-threatening infections..

[**2184-12-3**] CXR:
Right lung is clear. Mediastinum is shifted only slightly to the
left despite left upper lobectomy. A bulging mediastinal contour
projecting over the left hilus could be due to hematoma or
tissue augmentation of the left upper lobectomy and sleeve
resection. Apical pleural tube in place. No pneumothorax or
appreciable pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema, left chest
wall, is minimal. The posterior short-segment rib resection is
visualized by approximately one-half shaft width. Heart size is
normal.

[**2184-12-4**] CXR: No pneumothorax or pleural effusion, but apical
pleural tube in place. No change in mild subcutaneous emphysema
left chest wall and neck. Mild left suprahilar atelectasis is
new. No progressive enlargement of the post-operative left hilar
bulge, either hematoma or bronchial augmentation.  Right lung
clear. Heart size normal.

[**2184-12-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable to slightly increased left lung
atelectasis. Otherwise, unchanged compared to study done
yesterday.

[**2184-12-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable to slightly increased left lung
atelectasis. Otherwise, unchanged compared to study done
yesterday.

[**2184-12-7**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged,
partially obscured by left lower lobe and lingular atelectasis.
Surgical clips in the left hilum are again noted. There are no
pleural effusions or evident pneumothorax. Left subcutaneous gas
has decreased. Right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.  There
are low lung volumes. Surgical fracture of the posterior left
5th rib is again noted.

[**2184-12-9**] CXR: There is persistent opacity in the left lower
hemithorax consistent with large are of atelectasis. Fluid and
air in the left pleural space are small and grossly unchanged.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  Cardiomedistinum is
slightly shifted towards the left side. Surgical clips are
present in the left hilum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating
Room where he underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy and left VATS
with a left upper lobe sleeve resection (see Operative Report
for complete details). He tolerated the procedure well and was
brought to the SICU in stable condition.  He maintained stable
hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled with an epidural
catheter.  He was kept in the ICU overnight to optimize his care
and to monitor his respiratory status.  Good pulmonary toilet,
aggressive incentive spirometry, and nebulizers were used to
optimize respiratory function.  He was transferred to floor on
POD 1 requiring only 02 via nasal canula.

Neuro: The patient received an epidural and IV tylenol
immediately post-op with good effect and adequate pain control.
APS service retained epidural until POD 4 due to efficacy.  He
was subsequently transitioned to oxycodone as well as PO
tylenol.

CV: Metoprolol was use post-op for rate prophylaxis against
A-fib due to possible pericardial irritation intraoperatively.
Patient's rate well was controlled throughout his stay with out
issue and remained in sinus rhythm.  Patient will not be
discharged with home beta blockade.

Pulmonary: Good pulmonary toilet, nebulizers, incentive
spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged throughout his
stay.  Patient was quickly weaned to nasal canula and
subsequently room air.  Nebulizers were continued for persistent
wheezing noted on auscultation which had nearly completed
resolved by discharge.  Chest tube was kept to water seal and
initially had high output and was retained until POD 4 and was
discontinued without complication.  Routine CXR revealed
continued left sided atelectasis and flexible bronchoscopy was
performed by interventional pulmonology on POD 5 which revealed
granulation tissue along the anastomotic site.  Repeat CXR
showed continued atelectasis and questionable pleural effusion
and IP again saw the patient and performed ultrasonography which
revealed a small amount of fluid not amenable to drainage.
Patient was asymptomatic by discharge without shortness of
breath or respiratory distress and was ambulating without
difficulty on room air.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was started on sips and
advanced as tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when
necessary.

ID: Intraoperative cultures revealed gram negative rods on gram
stain and patient was begun on Unasyn.  Postoperatively he had a
leukocytosis to 28K which was downtrending throughout his stay.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely
watched and were downtrending throughout his stay and afebrile
at time of discharge.  Bacteria was speciated as H. flu that was
beta lactamase negative and presumptively  sensitive to
amoxicillin and patient was discontinued on a course of
augmentin.  Incisions were routinely monitoring and were without
signs or symptoms of infection.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received famotidine while in the ICU
and subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during
this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate
