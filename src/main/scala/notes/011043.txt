Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old male with PMH of diastolic CHF, atrial
fibrillation on warfarin rate controlled with diltiazem and
metoprolol s/p multiple cardioversions, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, CKI with recent Cr of 1.2, asthma, recent
S. aureus/G-strep bacteremia in [**11-17**], s/p retroperitoneal
hemmorhage in [**2143-6-7**] in the setting of INR of 8, normocytic
anemia with BM biopsy suggestive of early MDS, and severe eczema
presenting with increased shortness of breath with exertion over
the last month.  Over the last 2 weeks his weight has increased
by [**4-16**] pounds and he has noted increased abdominal distention.
He denies orthopnea or PND but does say that he has been waking
up with anxiety every morning at around 5AM for the past few
weeks and needs to get out of bed and walk around.  He reports
compliance with his medications except for one dose of Lasix
which he missed earlier today.  He went to [**Hospital3 **] over the
last week and reports eating clam chowder but says that he eats
a low salt diet in general.  His shortness of breath got worse
over the last 2 days prompting him to come in.  He denies any
chest pain, cough, or fever.  He notes mild lower extremity
edema but states it is constant with no change recently.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.1, 75, 158/91, 20, 100%.  He was found
to be tachypneic to the 40s with accessory muscle use and normal
oxygenation.  His blood pressure went up as high to the 170s
systolic and he was diaphoretic.  EKG showed evidence of atrial
fibrillation with a rate in the 80s with left axis deviation and
no evidence of ischemia.  In the ED, his exam was consistent
with CHF with elevated JVD and rales throughout.  Chest x-ray
showed evidence of volume overload.  He was placed on BiPAP and
a nitro drip.  Lasix 80mg IV was administered prior to transfer
to the CCU.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis. He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

REPORTS:
[**2144-5-8**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectases, and mild pulmonary
vascular engorgement.  If there is clinical concern for
infection, recommend repeat dedicated AP and lateral views in
the department.

[**2144-5-9**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Again seen are bilateral lower lobe opacities, left greater than

right.  These have slightly changed their appearance and still
could be due to either volume loss or infectious infiltrate.
There are probable small bilateral effusions.  There is mild
pulmonary vascular redistribution and mild cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a 74 year old male with PMH of diastolic CHF, atrial
fibrillation on warfarin rate controlled with diltiazem and
metoprolol s/p multiple cardioversions and HTN who presents with
increased shortness of breath with exertion over the last month
most consistent with an acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
exacerbation.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
#. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation:
Patient is presented with 5-10 pound weight gain, increased
abdominal distention, and shortness of breath consistent with
CHF.  His CHF exacerbation was likely triggered by poorly
controlled blood pressure in the setting of likely dietary
indiscretions over his recent vacation to [**Hospital3 **].  He
initially required BiPAP and a nitro drip in the ED as he was
acutely tachypneic.  He received 80 mg IV lasix prior to
admission to CCU and he was quickly weaned off BiPAP evening of
admission. He was restarted on his home blood pressure
medications and the nitroglycerin drip was weaned off the
morning after admission. He was called out to the cardiology
floor on room air and ambulatory. Blood pressures remained
relatively well controlled with [**Name (NI) 5462**] ranging 136-144 the 24
hours prior to dis
