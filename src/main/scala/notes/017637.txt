Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2194-1-21**] and was in an agitated
state.  She was pain free on IV NTG and heparin, and required
Haldol and Ativan for sedation.  Psychiatry was consulted and
her agitation eventually resolved.  She also had an infected
pilonidal cyst, which was cleared by general surgery, and had an
abdominal CT which showed a rectus sheath hematoma.  She was
transfused 2 UPRBC and the hematoma stabilized once the heparin
was d/c'd.  She was also evaluated by neurology who felt she has
a baseline dementia and cleared her for surgery as well.
Eventually she was cleared for surgery and on [**2194-1-30**] she had a
CABGx3 with LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM and Diag.  She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition on Epi and Propofol.
She was extubated on her post op night and was transferred to
the floor on POD#1.  Her chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#2 and her
epicardial pacing wires were d/c'd on POD#3.  She continued to
progress and had her pilonidal cyst debrided on POD#5.  She was
discharged to rehab in stable condition on POD#6.
