cerebral edema

History of Present Illness:
53 yo female with history of COPD, IVDU, and recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-4-29**] for COPD was re-admitted from the ED on
[**2186-4-30**] with headache, altered mental status, and blurred vision
in both eyes intubated for airway protection; MRI brain shows
posterior dominant cerebral edema and Neurology consulted.

Per ED notes, patient came to the ED with confusion, stating
that
she "felt like she was retaining CO2" and with 10/10 headache,
burred vision. Her vital signs on admission were notable for
temp
95.7, HR 65, BP 237/75, RR 12, Pulse ox 95% RA. In ED, HTN
treated with Nitro drip. For concern of CO2 retention,  BiPAP
trialed for a brief time with  albuterol and Atrovent nebs. She
appeared confused and received naloxone with no improvement.
During ED course, she apparently became increasingly confused
and
agitated and was intubated for combativeness and "airway
protection". She reportedly had an episode of bradycardia to the
30s. For concern of meningitis/encephalitis, she had an LP which
revealed Also, she had an LP. Tube 1: 2 WBC , 39 RBC and protein
158, glu 94. Tube 4: 4 WBC and 63 RBC (not clear if mislabeled
tubes).
Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was intubated and sedated on
propofol.

Her BPs while in ICU today have been 83/51 (thought to be
secondary propofol initiation)-189/100. Pt's high BPS tx with
hydralazine q6 hours and propofol. Her MS has been noted to "wax
and wane" on and off propofol. When she is off propofol, she
reportedly moves all ext, grimaces, keeps eyes closed with symm
pupils. MRI brain done today and Neurology called regarding
results. MRI appears to shows severe biparietal occipital and
cerebellar T2 FLAIR bright lesions and tonsillar herniation.
Mannitol 25 g IV x1 given and Neurosurgery called. EVD placed in
right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

Imaging:
[**2186-5-1**]:
MRI brain shows evidence of T2 FLAIR hyperintense changes in [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4746**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 46886**]-occipital lobes, cerebellum, r. thalamus, right caudate,
pons, right frontal subcort [**Male First Name (un) 4746**]. No DWI restriction. Mild
leptomeningeal enhancement in posterior brain. Third vent and
4th
vent larger compared. Descending tonsillar herniation with peri
mesencephalic effacement noted. MRA-focal aneurysm noted 6x4 mm
at ICU supraclinoid portion noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo female with history of severe COPD, Hep C, IVDU, and
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-4-29**] for COPD was
re-admitted from the ED on [**2186-4-30**] with headache, altered mental
status, and blurred vision, now with MRI suggesting PRES related
to Methylprednisolone-induced HTN, similar to prior episode.

1) PRLES: Posterior Reversible Leucoencephalopathy Syndrome
Patient had initially been admitted to the MICU service where
concern was for infectious encephalitis vs. meningitis. LP was
performed with Protein 158, Glucose 94, 4 WBC, 63 RBC in tube 4.

MRI showed [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4746**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 46886**]-occipital lobes, cerebellum, r. thalamus,
right caudate, pons, right frontal subcort [**Male First Name (un) 4746**]. No DWI
restriction. Third vent and 4th vent larger compared. There was
evidence for descending cerebellar tonsillar herniation with
peri mesencephalic effacement. Patient was started on Mannitol
and Neurosurgery placed EVD.
In the ICU pt demonstrated widely labile BP's and tachycardia.
This was thought secondary to opiate withdrawal (on methadone).
Methadone was restarted and pt became hypotensive to SBP's 90's
requiring brief period on neosynephrine. The pt was quickly
weaned and extubated without event. Her neurologic exam improved
markedly with only persistent hyperreflexia and upgoing toes.
Mannitol was discontinued [**5-5**] and her EVD was removed [**5-7**]
(initially it was clamped and ICP briefly went up to 25-27, so
it was reopened at 20 cm H20, but she tolerated repeat clamping
trial [**5-6**]) and she remained neurologically intact. She will
need a scalp stitch removed 5 days from [**5-7**] by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] pharmacologic action of the corticosteroids may have been
prolonged in the setting of the patient's Hep C infection,
though LFT's were only mildly elevated.
She was started on Keppra given her history of seizure during
her prior episode and she should [**Last Name (un) 7387**] on 500 [**Hospital1 **] until f/u in
neuro clinic.

2) Right ICA aneurysm-
Aneurysm at the junction of the cavernous and supraclinoid
portions of the right internal carotid artery measures 6 x 4 mm
on axial views with MRI. This should be followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in neurosurgery.

3) COPD-
Home O2 dependent. 2L at rest. 4L with activity. On CPAP at
night. Prednisone was held given probable etiology for
hypertensive crisis. She was restarted on home advair, spiriva,
albuterol nebs, atrovent nebs.
Resp status improved and she came off O2 and CPAP which she is
normally on at home. We have encouraged her to continue to
abstain from tobacco (this may be made more difficult in the
context of a partner who smokes). She passed PT evaluation of
stairs without O2 desaturation.

4) Opioid [**Name (NI) 46887**]
Pt was on 60 mg of Methadone at home but this was decreased to
40mg daily in the ICU due to blood pressure issues, and she
tolerated that dose well with no symptoms of withdrawal so we
have discharged her on that diminished dose after discussion
with her.
