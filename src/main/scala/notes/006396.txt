History of Present Illness:
89 yo M h/o stage IIIA lung CA (dx'd [**9-30**]), h/o PE x2 (IVC
filter '[**32**]), COPD, CHF (41%), HTN p/w dyspnea x 2 days. Pt is a
poor historian. He describes sudden onset of symptoms the night
before last. He felt dyspneic with associated R-sided low,
anterior chest pain. Pt also describes feeling fatigued with
subjective fevers. Poor po for the past week. He describes some
baseline DOE and cough, but is unclear as to whether this is
worse. He denies n/v/d/abd pain. Pt was brought in to [**Hospital1 **] by son
to [**Name (NI) **] given persistent symptoms.
.

97% 8L. Pt received approx 1.0 L NS with resolution of SBP to
100s-120s in ED, continued to receive approx 2 more liters. EKG:
st@ 114 bpm, lbbb(old). CXR: RLL consolidation. Labs wbc 19.1.
Cr 1.5. Lactate 1.8. CK 39, mb (-), tpn 0.02. D-dimer 3831. U/A
negative. Given asa 325 mg, levofloxacin 500 mg iv x1. CTA not
done as pt PE felt low prob, IVC filter in place. Transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
Stage IIIA non small cell lung cancer, squamous type:
Hospitalized on [**3-30**] CAP. CXR at the time demonstrated R hilar

septal defect may be seen with left bundle branch block. Reduced

IMPRESSION: Uninterpretable EKG in the absence of anginal
symptoms.

Cxr:IMPRESSION: Extensive right lower lobe consolidation. Given
known tumor, this is likely post-obstructive in etiology. Likely
small right pleural effusion as well.

[**5-15**] CTA
1.  Increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2.  Right infrahilar mass encasing the bronchus intermedius and
the right
inner lobar pulmonary artery as seen on prior examination.
There is worsening loculated pleural effusion on the right with
worsening right lower lobe and right middle lobe airspace
disease which may be secondary to post-obstructive pneumonitis;
however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Unchanged
interstitial opacities and bronchovascular bundle thickening
involving the lingula and right middle lobe which may also
represent an infectious or inflammatory process; however,
lymphangitic spread cannot be excluded.
.
CT chest 6.25
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right pleural effusion has nearly resolved following
placement of a
pleural catheter.  Only a small residual effusion remains, with
a small
hydropneumothorax component.
2.  Post-obstructive pneumonia in right lower lobe, with
additional areas of infectious consolidation involving the right
lung to a greater degree than the left.  Possible component of
necrotizing pneumonia as described.
3.  Extensive mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy with
neoplastic
encasement/obstruction of airways and encasement of interlobar
right pulmonary artery.
4.  Indeterminate left adrenal gland lesion without change since
[**2138-1-20**] torso CT.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70691**] is an 89 yo male with Stage 3A NSCLC admitted with
post-obstructive pneumonia.  He was treated with Levofloxacin.
Interventional pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter to drain the
pleural effusion on the right side.  They were unable to place
an endobronchial stent because the obstruction was too distal.
He also delevoped urinary retention that was alleviated with
foley.  Patient is now on flomax.

1.  Post-obstructive pneumonia.  Mr. [**Known lastname 70691**] has
post-obstructive pneumonia that was treated with Levofloxacin.
He will receive a total of 14 days.  He requires 9 more days of
treatment upon discharge.  IP was consulted and a bronch was
performed, however no possibility for stenting was seen. He
underwent thoracentesis and a pigtail catheter was left in place
for several days. Subsequently a CT was performed to assess for
possibility of pleurodesis but the patient was not deemed to be
a candidate.  The CT showed resolution of the right pleural
effusion.  Cultures from bronchial washing grew Staph coag
positive that was resistant to Levofloxacin.  However, the
patient responded clinically to the Levofloxacin and the Staph
Aureus may be a colonizer or a contaminant.  Therefore, it was
felt that the patient should remain on Levofloxacin and complete
a full course of 14 days.  He required oxygen by nasal canula
throughout the hospital stay but was confortable on room air on
the day of discharge.  He may continue to have low oxygen needs.
.
2.  Urinary retention.  He was noted to have large prostate on
imaging though not on treatment for BPH (and prostate not
enlarged by DRE). Given history of NSCLC, some concern for cauda
equina or spinal cord compression, however, complete neuro exam
(including rectal tone) w/in normal limits. A voiding trial
failed and a foley catheter was placed. Pt was started on
Tamsulosin and pt underwent another voiding trial which failed.
Foley should be left in place for 7 days before another trial is
attempted. Please leave foley in place for 5 more days following
discharge.  If the voiding trial should fail, pt will need to
have an indwelling foley and should have an outpatient referral
to urology.
.
3. [**Known lastname **]: He was tachycardic to the 120's on admission in
setting of fever and witholding of betablocker. Per PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 13223**] present since dx of lung ca (some concern for mets
to conduction system), with a baseline HR 100's. Atenolol
restarted and pt now returned to baseline.
.
4. Renal failure: Baseline creatinine is 1.0 but was elevated to
1.5 on admission. This was thought to be pre-renal becaus it
responded to IVFs.
.
5. COPD.  Flovent was started in place of beclamthasone.
Atrovent and albuterol were continued.
.
6. NSC lung CA stage IIIA.  There is discussion about single
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] chemotherapy versus hospice care.
.
7.  Hyptertension.  Controlled on atenolol.
.
8.  FULL CODE.  There were repeated discussions with patient.
