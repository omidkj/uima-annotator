Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, Confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD/Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
72yoM with h/o CVA x2 and resultant R sided weakness and
expressive aphasia, CKD, PVD including CAD s/p CABG, carotid
disease, peripheral arterial disease s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, and s/p
celiac and SMA stenting who presented to the ED as a transfer
after being found weak and confused by his children.
.
History is from his son [**Name (NI) **] who reports his brother went to
check on him early Wednesday am after he had called and found
the pt confused on the phone. In person pt was with slurred
speech, mumbling, not knowing what day it was or who he was. He
was noted to be stumbling, unstable on his feet, legs wobbly.
Unclear if he had a fall, hit is head, had LOC, or fell out of
bed as reported in signout. Also, son reports pt takes 10 or 20
mg Oxycodones for chronic abdominal pain, takes 3 at a time, up
to 5 per day. Taken to [**Hospital3 **] out of concern for acute
stroke. CT head was negative, he was given ASA.
.
Initial ED vitals: 98.0  166/75   62   16   99% 2L NC. Vitals
through his ED course: 150-160's  p70's  RR high 20-30's and
96-100% 2-3L. There was initial report of BRBPR, however on
further questioning of ED staff, this appears not really to have
been the case on repeat rectal exams. Hct was 28.3, down from
31.8 in [**2172**], Plts 127 lower than previous baseline, INR was 1.2
above baseline, renal function 30/2.4 (Cr 2.2 in [**2172**]). Trop was
negative x1, BNP was 20k. Lactate negative. CXR without read but
to me appears volume overloaded. EKG was with LBBB unchanged
from previous. Neuro was consulted who felt that his sxs were
possibly recrudescence of his old infarct, but cannot r/o new
process; however given his current state, was not candidate for
acute intervention until medically stabilized.
.
He was initially on nasal cannula, but was placed on Bipap for
tachypnea and was unable to be weaned off Bipap for tachypnea.
Pt was given 650 mg Tylenol, 10 mg IV Lasix, SL NTG x2, and
started on Nitro gtt. UOP was 1350 before Lasix, then 500 after.

.
Vitals before transfer: 72  167/81  32  98% on 2L
.
ROS as above, otherwise, with increased crying after wife passed
2 [**Name2 (NI) **] ago, for which he's started Wellbutrin, chronic abd pain,
and increased leg swelling recently.
ROS negative for f/c/ns, CP, SOB, d/c/n/v. Unclear if he has
orthopnea or PND. ROS o/w negative.

HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Pending):
.
CXR [**2174-8-5**]:
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema.
.
Echo [**2174-8-5**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the inferior and basal inferolateral segments. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
