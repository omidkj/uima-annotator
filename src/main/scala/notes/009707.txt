Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2155-7-9**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a median sternotomy.  Upon opening
the chest her aorta was noted to be heavily calcified to an
extent that an off-pump procedure was deemed to have an
unacceptably high stroke risk.  An off-pump bypass was then
attempted, but her blood pressure was unable to tolerate it.
The bypass was aborted and her chest was closed.  Please see the
operative note for details.  She was transferred in critical but
stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  Once
there, she was extubated and weaned from pressors.  By the
following day she was transferred to the surgical step down
floor.  Her chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed.  She
was gently diuresed.  A plan was made with her cardiologist to
return home to regain her strength, and then return at a later
date for stenting of her blocked coronary arteries.  By
post-operative day #4 she was discharged to home.
