Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Coronary artery dissection during elective cardiac
catheterization


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with DES*3 placed in LAD to LMA

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 y.o. female with a complicated past medical history
notable for COPD, laparoscopic choleycystectomy with course
complicated by CVA/TIA, perioperative NSTEMI, and pneumothorax
secondary to CVL placement who presents today after an elective
cardiac catheterization for known LAD disease.  Very briefly,
this lady had a long hospitalization in [**Month (only) 1096**] of this year
where she initially presented with gallstone pancreatitis.  She
went for laparoscopic choleycystectomy, which was complicated by
post-operative CVA.  Carotid ultrasounds at that time
demonstrated a high grade [**Country **] stenosis so she went for a
carotid endarterectomy.  She had considerable bleeding
postoperatively and had to be taken back to the operating room
where re-exploration revealed a loose suture that was repaired.
Post-operatively, she had EKG changes and elevated CE's
consistent with NSTEMI, but after being seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] she was
treated conservatively given the high risk of further procedures
at this point.  These symptoms resolved with conservative
treatment and echocardiogram showed no systolic dysfunction per
report.

She reports doing well after those events until earlier this
summer when she followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for
what sounds like stable angina.  She would have chest pain,
pressure, shortness of breath, and dyspnea with exertion.  She
never had pain at rest but has had shortness of breath sometimes
while just sitting around her house.  She also reports that the
amount of exertion it would take to bring on symptoms would be
quite variable so sometimes she could walk blocks without
symptoms and sometimes a single flight of stairs would lead to
symptoms.  The patient reports feeling a bit light-headed when
she gets her dyspnea, but she has never actually fainted.  She
denies any palpitations or diaphoresis during these incidents.
No orthopnea or PND.  These symptoms were worked up with a
stress cardiolyte that revealed 1-2 mm downsloping ST segment
depressions while the patient was dyspneic.  Nuclear imaging
confirmed a  reversible basal septal wall defect.  She went for
diagnostic cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant 3
vessel CAD.  No intervention was attempted and cardiac surgery
was consulted regarding the possibility of CABG.  The cardiac
surgery team evaluated her and per report they thought due to
comorbidities and anatomy (particularly the large amount of
calcified plaque in her aorta) that she would be unlikely to
benefit from surgery.  Thus, given her continued symptoms a
decision was made to proceed to cardiac catheterization and LAD
intervention.

On the day of admission she had a cardiac catheterization with
rotablation of the LAD stenosis and placement of a DES in the
LAD.  This procedure was complicated by a spiral dissection of
the calcified plaque in the LAD back to the LMA, LCx, and aortic
root.  With stenting the LAD and LMA are held open but the LCx
was fully jailed with residual dissection around it.  The LAD
dissection was stable as of the end of the procedure.  Given the
potential dangers of this dissection progressing the patient was
admitted to the CCU post-procedure for further monitoring.

<b>REVIEW OF SYSTEMS</b>
She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss
recently.  No vision changes, headaches, double vision, or
oropharyngeal bleeding.  She denies any cough, shortness of
breath (outside of that noted with exertion above), productive
sputum, or hemoptysis.  No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
melena, hematochezia, or any GI complaints.  No lower extremity
edema.  No rashes or skin changes.  No paresthesias.  No muscle
weakness noted except for chronic right foot drop, which has
been present since her stroke.

Cardiac Cath on [**2120-9-17**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
severe 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had some
calcifications. The LAD had a long calcified 95% proximal
stenosis. The
LCX was a small vessel with a high grade  mid vessel stenosis.
The RCA
was not engaged but was known to be diseased.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal
LAD with a 2.5 x 8 mm XIENCE DES. Stenting was complicated by a
guide
dissection of the LM which wrapped around into the LCX. The LM
was
successfully stented with overlapping 3.0 x 18 mm and 3.5 x 12
mm XIENCE
DES. Final angiography revealed a contained LM dissection but a
residually dissected LCX, no residual stenosis in the LM or
proximal LAD
stents and normal flow. (See PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD.
3. Guide dossection of the LM and LCX.
4. Successful stenting of the LM.

2D Echocardiogram on [**2120-9-18**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) ar
