Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2884**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
transesophageal echocardiogram; cardioversion; intubation;
pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 yoF w/ a h/o CAD s/p RCA stenting, diastolic
CHF, 1+ MR, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, previous smoking history, and
atrial fibrillation who presents for direct admission from home
for progressive shortness of breath. According to Pt, her
primary complaint is not shortness of breath, but cough X 1 week
which has been rarely productive of white sputum. She denies
associated fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, pleuritic pain,
weight gain, or dietary indiscretion. She also reports a sore
throat over the past 3 days. She recently underwent
thoracentesis for a moderate size pleueral effusion on [**2190-3-11**].
Cytology of the effusion was negative for malignant cells. Pt
denies recent palpitations, and reports that she has been
compliant with all medications. She admits to recent fatigue and
2 pillow orthopnea which has been present for months.

biatrial enlargement and a normal EF, 1+ MR, CTA chest in [**11-20**]
with likely biatrial thrombus ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] and RA).  He has had
PFTs [**2190-3-4**] c/w restrictive ventilatory defect, a low DLCO
which was consistent with an interstitial process.

Echo [**2190-3-19**]:
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the
left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage but there is no evidence of thrombosis. No significant
valvular abnormality.
.
V/Q scan [**2190-3-18**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Low probablity of pulmonary embolism. 2. Findings
most
compatible with COPD. Please clinically correlate.
.
CT Scan Chest [**2190-3-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is compatible
with history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
2. 8 mm left lower lung nodule can be followed in six months.
3. Resolving bilateral pleural effusions, now small.
4. Moderate cardiomegaly and extensive diffuse coronary artery
atherosclerotic calcifications are unchanged since [**2189-11-12**].
Findings were posted to the critical results dashboard on
[**2190-3-19**].



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 79 yo F w/ a h/o CAD, 1+MR, PFTs with restrictive
lung disease and possible interstitial process, previous smoking
history, HTN, afib, and hyperlipidemia who was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
direct admission for progressive shortness of breath on [**3-17**], [**2190**]. During her hospitalization, she underwent multiple
studies to evaluate her dyspnea including a V/Q scan, CT scan,
and cardiac echocardiogram. She underwent cardioversion on
[**2190-3-19**] and became hypotensive with a junctional rhythm requiring
intubation and a pacemaker placement, and was transferred to the
CCU. She was successfully extubated, and discharged back to the
floor, where the rest of her course was uneventful. She was
discharged on [**2190-3-21**] to home, in good condition, with
appropriate outpatient follow-up arranged. Her hospital course
was notable for:
.
Cardioversion/Pacemaker placement:
In order to optimize cardiac function with atrial kick, pt was
pretreated with Sotolol and underwent TEE and cardioversion of
afib on [**2190-3-19**].  After cardioversion, patient developed
junctional HR to 45bpm with SBPs in 80s.  She was placed on
dobutamine and HR increased to 80s (sinus vs antrial escape
rhythm).  Off of dopamine, HR and BP decreased with EKG
demonstrated QTc of 700.  Permanent pacemaker placed without
complications except requiring intubation for airway protection
complaint of nausea.
- Transferred to CCU for overnight monitoring and extubation on
[**3-19**]
- Patient extubated without event on [**3-19**] after arrival to CCU
[**3-20**]
- flipped back into Afib but w rate controlled, intermittently
paced
-Discussed pacing and medication regimen with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
decided to discontinue dronedarone due to patient preference and
low efficacy of medication. EP fellow Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed to
returning patient to home medication regimen of diltiazem and
metoprolol.
-EP fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] interrogated pacemaker and found patient
to be in Afib since aproximately 4am.  Pacemaker settings were
changed from atrial sensing/pacing to VVI (Ventricular sensing,
Ventricular pacing) at threshold rate of 70bpm.
- Pt was dicharged with outpatient follow-up to device clinic
scheduled for [**2190-3-30**]
