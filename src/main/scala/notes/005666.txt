Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening shortness of breath.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2196-9-27**]  TAVI CoreValve/ partial sternotomy ( [**Company 1543**] 26 mm)
[**2196-9-30**]  Re-exploration for bleeding


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with known aortic stenosis.
She was evaluated in [**2192**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consideration of
aortic valve replacement.  At that time, he felt that she was
not very symptomatic and that she had an extremely calcified
aorta and that surgery was deferred due
to prohibitively high risk.  The patient was minimally
symptomatic at that time with the exception of one isolated
event.  She returned to [**Hospital1 69**] six
weeks ago with worsening shortness of breath, lightheadedness
with exertion, and requiring two to three pills to sleep at
night as well as a 10-lb weight loss over the last two months.
She now is being referred for consideration of percutaneous
aortic valve replacement.  Her [**State 531**] Heart Association Heart
Failure Class is 2.

and dry with fair turgor with no lesions.  HEENT, normocephalic
and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact. Oropharynx

supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits.  Chest

Extremities show trace right lower extremity pedal edema.  Neuro
exam is nonfocal.  Gait is steady.  Pulses are 2+ throughout

TTE [**9-28**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. An aortic
CoreValve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild-to-moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional function. Well-seated Corevalve
prosthesis with normal gradient and no regurgitation. Mild to
moderate pulmonary hypertension.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced (but not well
seen on current study)

TTE [**10-4**]
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal IVC
diameter (<=2.1cm) with >50% decrease with sniff (estimated RA
pressure (0-5 mmHg).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting
LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve homograft (AVR). Thickened AVR
leaflets. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild functional MS due to MAC.
Physiologic MR (within normal limits). [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve appears to be a homograft. The
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a very small (~5 mm) mobile structure
attached/adjacent to the anterior mitral leaflet that may
represent a loose chord. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-9-28**],
findings are similar. The mobile structure associated with the
anterior mitral leaflet is better visualized in the current
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
83-year-old woman with known aortic stenosis. She was evaluated
in [**2192**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consideration of aortic valve
replacement.  At that
time, he felt that she was not very symptomatic and that she had
an extremely calcified aorta and that surgery was deferred due
to prohibitively high risk.  The patient was minimally
symptomatic at that time with the exception of one isolated
event. She recently returned to [**Hospital1 1170**] with worsening shortness of breath, lightheadedness with
exertion, requiring two to three pills to sleep at night as well
as a 10-lb weight loss over the last two months. She was
evaluated for consideration of percutaneous aortic valve
replacement.  Her [**State 531**] Heart Association Heart Failure Class
was 2. Since she had severe peripheral vascular disease and an
abdominal aortic aneurysm and very small subclavian arteries,
she was deemed appropriate for alternative access. Alternative
access in her case was chosen as d
