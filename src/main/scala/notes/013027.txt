Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
75yo male with complicated medical history including
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, afib, and systolic CHF (EF of 30%)
who is being admitted with dyspnea and altered mental status.
The patient was his NH and he was seen alert and talking at 2pm.
He was found at 3:30 extremely somulent with vomit in mouth.
Initially responsive only to uncomfortable stimuli. With
aggressive stimuli, later able to give [**12-29**] word answers. Initial
vitals at NH were SBP 110/70, pulse 85, sat 85% RA, 100% on O2,
BS 179. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further eval. Of note
the patient has had many previous admissions recently. Most
recently for multilobar pneumonia, CHF, and mild anemia, last
discharged on [**12-14**].
.
In the ED, initial VS:84 97.6 120/61 16 100% on NRB . An ABG
showed mild hypercarbia and acidosis. Given his somnolence,
hypercarbia, and DNR/DNI status, he was placed on BiPAP. CXR was
concerning for worsening CHF but could not exclude an infectious
process. He received Narcan with no effect. He received
azithromycin, levofloxacin and 500cc of fluid. Vitals prior to
transfer were 127/72, 70, rr 17
.
Currently, the patient is lying in bed with BIPAP in place. No
longer using accessory muscles to breathe. Sleepy but arousable
and fully oriented, answering questions in complete sentences.
Pt. feels that his breathing has been worse over the last
several days. Denies fevers, or chills and notes chronic
unchanged non-productive cough. Denies chest pain.

STUDIES:
EKG: v-Paced, no obvious ischemic changes
.
[**12-19**] CXR IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary edema and
bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, as
above. Superimposed infectious process/pneumonia cannot be
excluded and should be considered as clinically appropriate
.
.
[**12-19**] CT Head IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
.
[**12-20**] ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls, as
well as distal septum (most consistent with multivessel CAD).
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
35%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with moderate regional and
global systolic dysfunction. Borderline right ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-11-30**],
regional variation in LV dysfunction is now more apparent. LV
cavity is marginally smaller and the systolic function is
slightly more vigorous.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M with a history of HTN, HL, Afib, with many recent
admissions for multilobar pneumonia and CHF exacerbations who
presents with respiratory distress.
.
# Respiratory distress: Current acute onset most consistent with
an aspiration event, especially given vomit found in mouth.
However, CXR and clinical exam was also concerning for volume
overload. Acute new infection was felt to be less likely in the
absence of fever, elevated WBC, or lactate.  He received
noninvasive ventilation in the medical ICU,
