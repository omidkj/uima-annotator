none

History of Present Illness:
56 yo AA F, hx DM II, ESRD s/p caveric renal tx [**12-30**] with
worsening renal dysfunction over last 2 years (Cr 2.2 -> 3.6).
Her transplant course was complicated by rejection AV fistula in
[**1-28**], treated with steroids, resolved by [**4-29**] as well as BK
nephropathy treated with a decrease in immunosupression. The pt
presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**9-8**] with worsening dyspnea
and non-productive cough x1 week. Dyspnea associated with SOB, +
orthopnea. No CP or palpitations, mild nausea, no vomiting. On
presentation she was febrile to 102, although denies any
preceding fevers. Her oxygen saturation was 94-97% on 3L NC and
she was noted to be tachypneic to 30's. Pt initially treated
with solumedrol 125mg IVx1, azithromycin, and nebs. CXR
demonstrated bibasilar infiltrates, WBC of 18 with 86%
neutrophils. Chest CT on [**9-10**] also showed a LUL opacity. She
was initially started on moxifloxacin and vancomycin. On [**9-11**]
developed worsened SOB, O2 sat to 84% on 4L NC, placced on 100%
on NRB, trial of BiPAP, which she did not tolerate. Prior to
d/c, abx were broadened to tigecycline, aztreonam, and
caspofungin.
Upon arrival, pt states that her breathing feels improved. Her
non-rebreather 100% mask was able to be weaned off to 3L NC
while settling settling in. She denies any chest pain,
significant SOB, nausea, palpitations. She notes that her leg
edema is improved compared to baseline.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

PA and lateral chest radiographs dated [**2192-9-13**],
compared to portable AP chest radiograph dated [**2192-9-12**].
On this radiograph, multifocal consolidations are appreciated in
the left upper lung, right middle and right lower lung. Mild
cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. There are no pleural effusions. Pulmonary
vascularity is normal.

IMPRESSION: Multifocal areas of consolidation,the right lower
lobe areas are concerning for pneumonia.

ECHO [**2192-9-12**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular  cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal  (LVEF>55%). There is an abnormal
systolic flow contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow
obstruction. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitralregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
V/Q scan low probability
.
[**9-19**] CT chest: As suggested on the prior chest
radiographs, there are multiple linear opacities within the lung
lobes, right greater than left consistent with atelectasis
and/or scarring.  There are no focal areas of airspace
consolidation, or pleural effusion.  The airways are patent to
the segmental level bilaterally.  There are no pathologically
enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes.  The heart
is normal in size.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen
within the aorta, left anterior descending and right coronary
arteries.  The aorta and great vessels are normal.  There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ABG on RA after pneumonia: was 7.40/41/54.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F hx renal tx presents from OSH, admitted with 1 wk
worsening dyspnea, non-productive cough, fever. Transferred
after worsening dyspnea despite antibiotic treatment, dyspnea
resolved on transfer.  Pt. was transferred from ICU soon after
admit as dyspnea had resolved.
.
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia- no organism identified in sputum at outside
hospital, and a sputum was unable to be obtained here. She was
begun on levofloxacin and vancomycin for community acquired
pneumonia (started at OSH).  PA/LAT CXR showed a multilobar PNA.
Her WBC count decreased from around 20 at the OSH to about
[**9-6**]; her dyspnea totally resolved however her hypoxia
continued.  She remained on her home asthma medications although
she never showed any signs of obstructive disease on CXR or
exam. A trial of diuresis did not improve her hypoxia.  An ABG
on room air showed 7.40/41/54. At this point the pulmonary
consult team consulted and a Chest CT was obtained that showed
diffuse scarring versus atelectasis.  A V/Q scan showed
low-probability for PE.  Pulmonary consult felt that her hypoxia
was due to shunt physiology and upon reviewing the CT scan felt
her abnormal findings were most likely due to atelectasis. She
had PFTs directly before discharge, the results of which are
still pending. It was additionally recommended that a
echocardiogram with bubble study be performed in the future to
evaluate for intracardiac shunt. However, the pulmonary team
assessing the patient agreed that this was likely a chronic
condition and did not need additional extensive inpatient work
up and management. However, given PaO2 < 60 and desaturation
with ambulation, the patient will require oxygen therapy, 2L NC
currently. The patient will require O2 with ambulation, at
night, and for O2 sats < 90% at rest. She will continue oxygen
therapy and will receive additional pulmonary follow up upon
discharge from her upcoming psychiatric admission.
.
3. CHF - BNP of 8055, no echo in our system, negative cardiac
cath 10 yrs ago. Pt appears clinically euvolemic, had ECHO that
showed preserved LVEF, with moderate pulmonary hypertension.
She was continued on metoprolol 150 [**Hospital1 **], zocor, lasix 60 [**Hospital1 **].
Her hypoxia did not improve with a trial of diuresis.
.
4. Hx of renal transplant - Ms [**Known lastname 13662**] was continued on her home
regimen of prednisone 5mg and tacrolimus; her tacrolimus was
decreased to 3mg [**Hospital1 **]. Renal func
