Ms. [**Known lastname 24344**] is a 86 yo RHW with h/o HTN, HL who presents with
difficulty speaking this morning. The patient lives in
apartment

checks on her frequently. She checked on patient last night at
10:30pm, and patient was at her baseline. She had been feeling
tired with GI upset yesterday, but was walking, speaking and
interacting normally. This AM, she checked on the patient at
8am.
The patient was still in bed but was awake. She seemed "distant"
and was answering questions in one or two words only. One hour
later, at 9am, the patient had gotten up herself to her rocking
chair. She was only responding "yup" to questions, and she would
not say her daughter-in-law's name. She seemed not to be
processing the question asked of her. She had also been
incontinent of urine, which is not typical for her. EMS was
called. The patient did say some short phrases later in the
morning, and said her son's name, but continues to have paucity
of speech. Speech was never slurred or garbled.

L frontal ICH. BP ranged 130-140s. Exam showed no weakness.

dressing, cooking some meals, eating. She walks with a walker.

Pertinent Results:
CT head:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged size of a large left frontal
intraparenchymal hematoma. There is minimally increased
rightward shift of neighboring midline structures. Moderate
effacement of the left lateral ventricle is stable.

ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient [**Name (NI) 24344**] was admitted after being found to have a large
frontal hemorrhage (Left side). It was felt to be secondary to
amyloid angiopathy given the location. She was admitted as a
DNR/DNI to the ICU for closer monitoring and being placed on
mannitol. Her stay was prolonged in the ICU after receiving
lorazepam for agitation resulting in significant lethargy. Her
examination improved over her short ICU stay from a globally
aphasic patient to one that was able to answer questions
appropriately using 3 word sentences. The patient could not
tolerate the placement of an NG tube and she was placed on PPN.
Her medical condition continued to deteriorate over the
following days, including hypotension and atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular rates that was poorly tolerated. Her
family, acting on her wishes, requested that she was not
intubated. She was made CMO and passed shortly afterward.
