Admission Date:  [**2133-8-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-9-8**]


Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
female who had witnessed arrest.  The patient was
resuscitated in the field and taken to [**Hospital6 3874**] where she was found to be stridorous.  She was
intubated in the Emergency Department and a further
evaluation showed that she had ruled in for a myocardial
infarction.

A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
less than 35% with anterior and apical akinesis; although the
patient's electrocardiogram changes were primarily
inferiorly.  Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 3874**] showed an 80% left anterior descending artery
stenosis, a 95% distal left anterior descending artery
stenosis, and 50% to 60% right coronary artery disease.

The patient had a computerized axial tomography performed
which showed an 8-cm mediastinal goiter with a 4.7-cm
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The patient also had a bronchoscopy done at [**Hospital6 3873**] which showed tracheal compression from the
goiter.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2112**].
3.  Known thyroid goiter.
4.  Mild dementia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Isordil 20 mg by mouth four times per day.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**8-27**]
intubated and sedated.

The Pulmonary Service was consulted, and the patient
underwent a bronchoscopy which showed [**Last Name (un) 50614**] edema, mild
tracheal malacia of the posterior membrane, and a 50%
reduction of the tracheal lumen.  The patient was noted to
have coffee grounds in the endotracheal tube with adequate
oxygenation and ventilation.

After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**], it was decided that the patient would be weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation on [**8-29**].

The patient was also noted to have a large area of ecchymosis
over the right side of her neck which was thought to be due
to bleeding into the large mediastinal goiter which
subsequently caused the airway compression.  This ecchymosis
subsided over the next several days.  The patient was weaned
and extubated from mechanical ventilation on hospital day
three.

On hospital day four, the patient was noted to have
increasing amounts of confusion.  The patient was tentatively
scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft and thyroidectomy
for [**8-31**].

On[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**8-31**], the patient was found to have
severe confusion and agitation.  It was decided by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to postpone the surgery to resolve the patient's
agitation.

A Neurology consultation had been obtained on [**8-30**] to
delineate the extent of her confusion.  Upon conversations
with the family, the Neurology team learned that the patient
has had progressing short-term memory loss and baseline mild
dementia.

A computed tomography scan was obtained.  The computed
tomography scan showed no acute bleed and a small old lacunar
infarction in the right basal ganglia.  It was also noted by
Neurology that the patient had ptosis which they thought
could be a component of [**Last Name (un) 50615**] syndrome with the large
mediastinal goiter.  The Neurology team's recommendations
were to pan-culture the patient to look for a source of
infection and to minimize narcotics the patient was receiving
to allow her confusion to clear.  The subsequent cultures
showed that the patient had an Escherichia coli urinary tract
infection and a sputum culture that was positive for
hemophilus influenza.  The patient was started on
levofloxacin.

Psychiatry was consulted, and they recommended starting
around the clock Haldol which subsequently improved the
patient's agitation and confusion.

Af[**Last Name (STitle) **]ltiple conversations with the neurologist, the
Thoracic Surgery team, and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] were had it was
decided that the patient would most benefit from an
interventional cardiology procedure to stent to the left
anterior descending artery lesion as opposed to taking the
patient to the operating room for bypass surgery as the
patient's mental status at baseline had been recently
declining.  There was concern about the patient's ability to
return to her premorbid functional status.

On [**9-2**], the patient was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] and underwent a
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and had a
cypher stent placed in her left anterior descending artery
lesion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
returned to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

Status post procedure, the patient was started on aspirin and
Plavix.  She remained hemodynamically stable.

On [**9-3**], the patient was transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to the regular floor.  The patient's mental status
continued to improve.

The patient had been noted to have abnormal thyroid function
tests on admission.  These thyroid function tests were
repeated.  They were significant for a thyroid-stimulating
hormone of 0.09, a T3 of 55, and a T4 of 9.3.  The patient's
primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9960**] who was also an
endocrinologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] as well as the Endocrinology
Service at [**Hospital1 69**].  Both teams
felt that the patient required no intervention to these
laboratory data, and the patient's large goiter could be
followed up as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] at some
later date.  Therefore, it was decided that the patient
should be discharged.

By [**9-3**], the patient was cleared for discharge to
rehabilitation; however, on [**9-4**] the patient developed
an elevated white blood cell count to 15.  The patient was
pan-cultured.  The patient was empirically started on
ceftriaxone.

On [**9-5**], the patient's white blood cell count had risen
to 23.9; however, at that time the patient was afebrile.  The
patient's chest x-ray had a right middle lobe infiltrate.  A
Medicine Service consultation was obtained on [**9-7**].  It
was also noted at this time that the patient had a mildly
elevated creatinine.  It was recommended by the Medicine team
to discontinue the ceftriaxone and give the patient some
intravenous fluids.  With these two interventions, the
patient's white blood cell count decreased from 16 to 11, and
her creatinine decreased from 1.3 to 1.1 on [**9-8**].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**9-8**], the patient was
cleared for discharge to home with her family and with
visiting nursing.

LABORATORIES ON DISCHARGE  Temperature maximum was 98.9
degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 67 (sinus rhythm), her
blood pressure was 92/60, her respiratory rate was 18, and
her oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.  The patient was
awake, alert, and pleasant.  She was oriented to person only.
Her neurologic examination was significant for severe memory
deficits as well as some mild right eye ptosis and right eye
myosis.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  No murmurs or
tubs.  The neck was supple with a palpable thyroid with a
resolving right-sided ecchymotic area.  Chest examination
revealed the breath sounds were clear bilaterally.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  The patient was tolerating a regular diet.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ pitting edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's white
blood cell count was 11, her hematocrit was 32, and her
platelet count was 397.  Her sodium was 138, potassium was
3.9, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen
was 31, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 133.

The patient's chest x-ray from [**9-7**] showed resolution
of the right middle lobe infiltrate and small bilateral
pleural effusions.
