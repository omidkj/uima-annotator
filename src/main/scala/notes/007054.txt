pleural effusions, right greater than left.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially admitted to the CSRU for eval of trach site
bleeding. Heparin was stopped at [**Hospital1 **] prior to admission to
[**Hospital1 18**], INR on admission was 1.3, PTT 29.4. The patient received
2 Unnits PRBCs, trach site was packed w/ surgicell. Pt was
placed on ventilatory support initially then weaned to trach
mask continuous w/ stable resp status. He continued to have
large amount of secretions requiring suctioning.  Large right
pleural effusion was noted on CXR and tapped for 2100cc. Heparin
was resumed on [**2139-11-16**] after pleural tap.  CXR's were
concerning for reaccumulation of effusion, although oxygenation
was stable.  The patient was initially started on ethacrynic
acid for diuresis, however this was held after bicarbonate was
noted to rise to 40.  VBG revealed nl CO2 of 49.  He will need
on going trach collar care and weaning as tolerated.  For the
mechanical valve and a. fib he was continued on heparin drip
until INR was therapeutic.  Initially started on 4mg and then
increased to 6 mg on [**2139-11-24**].  Heparin should be continued and
Coumadin dose adjusted appropriately for goal INR 2.5-3.0.
.
In hospital course was complicated by delerium.  Neurology was
consulted and work-up including B12, RPR, folate, ammonia were
unrevealing, no evidence of hypoxia, head ct negative for bleed,
and mental status cleared slowly.  Post pyloric dob-hoff was
placed on [**11-25**] prior to transfer to rehab.
