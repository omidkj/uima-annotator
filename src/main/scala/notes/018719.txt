History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76105**] is an 80 yoM with PMH significant for COPD, PHTN,
PVD, HTN was sent from rehab for chills, nausea/vomiting and
paleness. Pt states that he was woken up from sleep because of
nausea the night before presentation. Also unable to tolerate
POs. Went to scheduled outpt appt with podiatric surgeons who
performed archilles tendon surgery. Felt chills upon return from
the appt, went to bed to warm up, and pt does not remember
anything from that point on until he woke up in the hospital.
.
Per records from NH, patient complained of nausea over the past
2 days. He had also had a non-productive cough over the past few
days as well. No report of fevers. At 1pm on the day of
admission he vomited up a moderate amount which was heme
positive. His oxygen saturation dropped to 80% on 3L and
increased to 89-90% on 5L. His vitals at this time were T 99.9
BP 80/40 AR 129 RR 26-28 O2 sat 87% on 5L. He appeared dusky and
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further work-up.
.
Of note, the patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-21**]. He
underwent lengthening of his achilles tendon on [**6-14**].
Post-operatively his O2 saturation was 80% on RA. His O2 sats
remained low despite being on a non-rebreather and dropped to
the 70's while sleeping. He was transferred to the MICU for
closer monitoring. The pulmonary service was also consulted
during this time. The patient was treated with Cefpodoxime for
an aspiration pneumonia during this admission.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.5 BP 134/50 AR 119 RR 20 O2
sat 93% NRB. His O2 saturation dropped to 80% RA, then increased
to 87% on 5L NC. He was given 2L NS. He also received
Ceftriaxone 1gm, Vancomycin 1gm IV, Levaquin 750mg IV, and
Methylprednisone 125mg IV.
.
In the MICU, pt was continued on Vancomycin and Zosyn for
treatment for HAP, given pt's recent prior hospitalization and
rehab stay. Blood cultures were sent on [**2129-6-29**], which showed no
growth in 2 days (final result pending). IVFs were given to
maintain MAP>60. Pt was continued on ventimask with plan to
transition to NC. Pt continued to require ventimask during her
ICU stay. Pt's home antihypertensives were held while pt's blood
pressures normalized with IV fluids. Cr dropped to baseline with
hydration. Pt was transferred to floor in stable condition on
Hospital Day 3.

Relevant Imaging:
CXR [**2129-6-29**] There is focal area of pneumonic consolidation at
the right lung base. Left lung is clear. Surgical clips are seen
in the right axilla. Please followup the right lung base
pneumonic consolidation to clearance.
.
CXR [**2129-6-30**] The right lower lobe consolidation is grossly
unchanged but the left lower lobe linear opacities most likely
consistent with atelectasis have slightly improved. The upper
lungs demonstrate severe emphysema, but otherwise clear.  Note
is made that the left costophrenic angle was not included in the
field of view. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2129-7-1**] Little change with persistent right lower lobe
consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76105**] is an 80 yo male with PMH as listed above who
presents with hypoxia, RLL infiltrate, and hypotension.
.
1)Hospital aquired pneumonia: Patient initially presented with
early sepsis physiology. He was tachycardic, hypotensive, and
had a significant leukocytosis. He had a RLL infiltrate on chest
Xray consistent with HAP (given his recent hospitalizations) and
was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**6-29**] for 7 day
course. His hypotension resolved within 24 hours after he
received multiple fluid boluses. He was transferred to the floor
on [**7-1**] and did well with decreased oxygen requirement. Blood
cultures x 1 were NGTD at time of discharge. He was afebrile x
36 hours.
.
2)Hypoxia: At baseline, patient has COPD with cor pulmonale. Pt
states that he has emphysema, and is followed by a pulmonologist
in [**Location (un) 5131**]. Pt has been told that he requires 3L NC during
the day and a 40% ventimask at night but he is not always
compliant. Pt does use oxygen concentrator. Pt likely
decompensated in the setting of the pneumonia. He recieved 1
dose of steroids in the ED but this was stopped in the ICU since
his clinical presentation was not consistent with a COPD
exacerbation. During his stay in the MICU he was placed on nasal
cannula but required the 50% ventimask. He was continued on
antibiotics as above. On the floor, pt desatted to 70s on RA but
was satting in mid 90s on 5L NC at time of discharge. Goal will
be for patient to return to baseline of 3L nasal cannula with
40% facemask at night.
.
4)s/p Achilles tendon repair: Stable at this time. Should avoid
fluoroquinolones given increased risk for tendon rupture.
Podiatry (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1140**] following. Per their recs: place in MP boot
while in-house and discharge in [**Hospital1 **]-valve cast. Sutures removed
on Monday [**2129-7-4**]. No dressing changes  Please make sure patient
has b/l bivalve splints on.
.
5)Hypertension: Baseline blood pressures in low 100's. Decreased
to 80's at NH and upon transfer to the MICU. SBP 140s on tx to
floor with holding of home HTN regimen in MICU. Amlodipine and
HCTZ were restarted at home doses upon transfer to the floor. Pt
was not taking Lisinopril at home, although was listed in the
home med list. His SBP was 100s on Amlodipine and HCTZ. For
improved renoprotection, Amlodipine was D/C'd and was restarted.
SBP 100s-120s at time of discharge.
