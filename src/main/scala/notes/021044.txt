Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
female who had an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2134-3-5**].  The patient did well initially.  However, she
soon developed recurrent infections of her sternal wound.
She was last admitted in [**2134-6-5**] for sternal wound
drainage and infection.  At that time, she was started on
intravenous antibiotics.  She underwent sternal wound
debridement and the placement of a VAC sponge.  The patient
was then discharged to home.  She had her VAC sponges changed
periodically for the following few weeks.  After that, the
VAC sponge was removed, and wet-to-dry dressings were applied
to her sternal wound.  The wound appeared to be healing
slowly.  However, prior to the current admission, the patient
developed increased amount of greenish drainage from the
wound.  The patient was readmitted for the further management
of her recurrent sternal wound infection.

ALLERGIES:

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily
2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily
3.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice a day
4.  Lescol 40 mg once daily
5.  Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice a day
6.  Insulin NPH 40 units in the morning, 14 units in the
evening, sliding scale

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 175/58, heart rate 60,
afebrile.  General:  Elderly female, in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  Within normal
limits.  Neck examination:  No bruits, no jugular venous
distention detected.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Chest wound partially open, with yellowish
drainage.  Heart examination:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination:  Bowel sounds present, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm and well
perfused.  Neurologically:  Grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 31.2, white blood cell count
6.5, platelets 340.  INR 1.1.  Glucose 142, BUN 32,
creatinine 1.2, sodium 145, potassium 4.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery
for further management of her sternal wound infection.  On
[**2134-10-12**], the patient underwent sternal wound debridement and
placement of a VAC sponge.  The procedure was without any
complications.

Postoperatively, in the recovery room, the patient complained
of shortness of breath.  She was 97% on 3 liters.  The chest
x-ray obtained at the time showed leftward deviation of
sternal wires, but no sign of effusion or consolidation.  The
original plan was to move the patient to the regular floor
from the recovery room.  However, when the patient was being
moved to the floor, she desaturated to 50s, had poor
respiratory effort and poor air movement.  Her rhythm
exhibited some premature ventricular contractions initially,
but then stabilized.  The patient was transported to the
Intensive Care Unit.

In the Intensive Care Unit, her vital signs stabilized.  She
was in sinus rhythm, with a heart rate in the 60s to 70s, and
stable blood pressure.  Her oxygen saturation improved
significantly.  The patient was then transferred to the
regular floor in stable condition.

On postoperative day two, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation.  Of note is that the patient had a similar
event last time postoperatively when she underwent her
coronary artery bypass graft a few months ago.  The patient
was treated with amiodarone load in addition to a standing
dose, and her Lopressor was increased.  Her heart rate was
originally in the 120s to 130s.  We were able to bring her
heart rate under 100.  However, she still remained in atrial
fibrillation/atrial flutter.

Cardiology was consulted for possible external cardioversion.
The patient was started on intravenous heparin.  On [**2134-10-15**],
the patient was cardioverted by Cardiology into sinus rhythm.
Cardioversion was successful, and the patient remained in
sinus rhythm until her discharge.  The patient was continued
on intravenous heparin.  Her amiodarone was decreased to 400
mg twice a day, which she will continue to receive for two
weeks, after which her dose will be decreased to 400 mg once
daily for approximately three months, after which she will
continue on a standing dose of 200 mg of amiodarone once
daily.  In addition, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor was placed for
two weeks, to monitor the patient's rhythm, and the [**Location (un) 1131**]
will be sent to her cardiologist daily.  The VAC sponge was
changed prior to discharge.

The patient was discharged to home in stable condition on
[**2134-10-16**].
