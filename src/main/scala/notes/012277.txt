History of Present Illness:
70 yo woman with  a pmh sig for CHF, COPD, pulm htn, Afib, MRSA
endocarditis, pseudomonas bacteremia, chronic rlq pain, who
presented with hypotension, bandemia, and a UTI. She originally
required dopamine for blood pressure support, but was
hemodynamically stable once admitted to the ICU. She was started
on Vancomycin and Aztreonam given her history of MRSA. Pt was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] several weeks ago for treatment of C.
difficile colitis (she had finished treatment) and was in USOH
where she lives at [**Hospital3 **] Center until the day
prior to presentation when she was found to be hypotensive. On
day of presentation she became confused and was brought to ED
where found to have UTI with bandemia and hypotension though
afebrile. She was transfered to the ICU.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2122-11-28**] 9:49 AM
Comparison is made to previous exams of [**2122-11-11**] and 10- [**3-11**].
There is stable mild cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are stable in appearance. There is no significant upper
zone redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature. There are no
focal consolidations or definite pleural effusions. The
visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are stable. Again
noted is a nonhealed fracture of the distal right clavicle.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF or pneumonia.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2122-11-28**] 10:04 AM
1. Mild thickening of descending colon compatible with colitis.
In the setting of atherosclerotic disease and hypotension,
ischemia is a consideration. Infectious and inflammatory causes
are also possibilities.
2. Congestive failure with minimal right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 70 y.o female with a history of severe
diastolic CHF (EF 55%), COPD, DMII, chronic renal insufficiency,
and a recent ICU admit x 2 for MRSA aortic valve endocarditis
and pseudomonal sepsis (secondary to wound infection), status
post intubation x 2 on her prior admits, who presented on
[**2122-11-28**]. On the day prior to presentation she was found to be
hypotensive. hTN meds held. On day of presentation with
confusion and in ED, found to have UTI with bandemia and
hypotension though afebrile. She did not meet sepsis criteria.
She was transfered to the ICU where she was peripheral dopamine
which was weaned within the first 12 hours and recieved NS
overnight. BP increase [**Location (un) **] next 12 hours off dopamine and CVP
improved.  Transferred to the floor on [**2122-11-29**].

1) UTI - treated with aztreonam to cover common GNR's,
pseudomonas, enterococcus, following urine/blood culture; on
Vancomycin as has recent history of MRSA. Urine cultures
positive for gram positive cocci suggestive of strep and
enterococci. Sensitivities pending. Blood culture still pending.
PICC line placed for abx treatment to be a total of 7 days. Will
need repeat bld cx once off abx. Please follow up cxs in a few
days.

2) CHF - cont lasix, lopressor, statin, aspirin. Spironolactone
d/c'd as this may have cont. to hypotension.

3) ARF - ACE inhibitor restarted with improvmeen in Cr over
hosptial course.

4) A Fib - resistant to cardioversion, rate controlled with
amiodarone and lopressor; INR suprtheraptuic to 5.7, liklely
related to abx. Coumadin held for 2 days until INR to 2.0 day
prior to d/c. Restarted coumadin at 3 mg qhs and check coags.
Will need INR monitoring and readjustment once abx are stopped.

5) Abdominal pain
- CT A/P with ?colitis in descending colon. Given patient's
history of C. diff with still loose stool, checked stool
cultures for C. diff. Lactate 1.1 not suggestive of ischemic
colitis in this setting. No further complaints. Given hx and abx
now, startd on flagyl empirically for 14 days.

6) Thrush: Nystain oral solution for this.

7)Hypothyroidism: On thyroxine, needs to be monitored in 6
weeks.

8) Depression: Psych saw pt here and suggest increasing ritalin
dose to 5 mg in afternoon and 10 mg in am for help with energy
level. Psych f/u as oupt.

9) DM: good glycemic control on RI SS. Lantus held for first 3
days and restarted at 18 units 2 days prior to d/c. Continue to
monitor FS and adjest as PO intake improves.

10) Code - full. Treat aggressively all reversible illnesses
including mech ventilation and cardioversion, no heroic measures
if no meaningful recovery possible.

D/c back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
