HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
female with a history of critical aortic stenosis who
presented to an outside hospital with a two week history of
worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea.  She had been
sent by her PCP for an echo that showed normal left
ventricular ejection fraction, but severe left ventricular
hypertrophy, EF 55%.  Right ventricle was normal in size and
function.  There was mild apical hypokinesis with 1+ MR and
severe AS.  On [**2139-1-11**], patient became confused and
was very short of breath.  At that time she was brought to
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital where she was found to be in
complete heart block with a heart rate of 30 to 35.  She had
an external pacer placed and was diuresed.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2139-1-14**], for cardiac catheterization to evaluate
her coronaries and her cardiac function.  During the cardiac
catheterization a temporary pacer wire was placed.  During
the catheterization patient was also noted to have an aortic
valve area of 0.7 cm squared and was scheduled for
valvuloplasty to increase the valve area.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis with a valvular area
of 0.6 to 0.7 cm squared.  Hypertension.  Chronic renal
insufficiency.  Diabetes mellitus.  Status post
cerebrovascular accident 10 years ago with mild dementia.
Hypercholesterolemia.  Hypothyroidism.

was an awake, comfortable, elderly, Portuguese female in no
acute distress.  HEENT pupils equal, round and reactive to
light.  Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes slightly dry.

warm with good capillary refill.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG on presentation Wenckebach with
bifascicular block, left axis deviation, right bundle branch
block, Qs in 2, 3, aVF, V5 and V6.  She subsequently had
another EKG which showed complete heart block with junctional
escape at 35, no right bundle branch block, Qs in 2, 3 and
aVF, ST-T wave depressions in V5 and V6.  Prior to discharge
patient was noted to be atrially sensed and ventricularly
paced rhythm with numerous premature ventricular
contractions.  She had the following laboratory values.  On
admission CBC was white blood cell count 9.7, hemoglobin
10.8, hematocrit 33.4, platelets 256.  PT 16.8, PTT 28.5, INR
1.9.  Sodium 140, K 5.1, chloride 106, bicarb 20, BUN 59,
creatinine 2.1, glucose 206.  She had lipids which showed the
following.  Total cholesterol 106, LDL 47, HDL 38,
triglycerides 103.  TSH was 3.49.  CK and troponin were
negative.  She had an echo on [**1-13**] which showed EF of
55%, severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy 21 to 22
mm, mild apical hypokinesis, aortic valve area of 0.7 cm
squared, mild MR and severe aortic stenosis.  She had cardiac
catheterization which showed the following values.  Right
atrial pressure 21, right ventricular pressure 85/25,
pulmonary artery pressure 85/30, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 35, cardiac output 2.8, cardiac index 1.5, SVR [**2106**],
peripheral vascular distance of 314.  AV gradient was 66.
Aortic valve area was 0.5 cm squared.  SVC sat 48, pulmonary
artery sat 44.  Coronaries showed proximal RCA 40% lesion,
but left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex
were all clear.  On the day prior to discharge patient had
the following laboratory values.  CBC was 10.3 white blood
cell count, hematocrit 34.0, platelets 169.  She had
chemistry 7 of sodium 143, K 3.5, chloride 102, bicarb 29,

which showed heart upper limits of normal, persistent
vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness consistent with CHF.
She had slight interval improvement in the left retrocardiac
opacity and small bilateral effusions, left slightly larger
than right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular.
Aortic stenosis.  The patient was found to have critical
aortic stenosis with a valvular area of 0.6 to 0.5 cm
squared.  She underwent valvuloplasty on [**2139-1-15**],
at which time she had two times valvuloplasty which increased
the aortic valvular area from 0.55 to 0.80 cm squared and
decreased the gradient across the aortic valve from 89 to 50.
In addition, her blood pressure was controlled with Lopressor
and Bumex and lisinopril to generally the 120s to 140s
systolic.  She suffered no chest pain or palpitations
in-house.  She was found to be mildly short of breath on
several occasions, was diuresed with resolution of shortness
of breath.  In addition, patient was also found to be in
complete heart block on presentation.  On [**1-16**] she
underwent pacemaker placement and had a DDD pacer placed
without complications and remained atrially sensed and
ventricularly paced through the remainder of her hospital
stay.  However, she was noted to have frequent runs of
nonsustained v-tach and frequent PVCs.

2.  Infectious disease.  The patient was found to have a
temperature to 103 the day following placement of the pacer.
She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for possible
pacer placement induced bacteremia and possible retrocardiac
opacity.  She continued to have fever through [**1-18**],
but thereafter remained afebrile.  She was to continue on a
total 10 day course of levofloxacin and vancomycin to be
dosed for a level less than 15, checked on a daily basis.
All of her blood cultures and urine cultures from her
hospital stay remained negative.

3.  Endocrine.  The patient has diabetes mellitus and was
treated conservatively with a dose of NPH of 30 in the
morning and 10 at night and regular insulin sliding scale.
Her sugars were fair, between 160 and 300 generally.  She was
treated initially with an insulin drip before being
transferred over to NPH and regular insulin sliding scale and
transferred to the floor.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is in fair condition on
discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab to be specified in a discharge
addendum.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
