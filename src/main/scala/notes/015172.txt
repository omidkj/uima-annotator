History of Present Illness:
49yo female with congential heart disease(ASD and mitral repair
at age 9)who was admitted to Good Samaritain in [**2196-7-6**] with
NSTEMI and elevated BNP. She
underwent extensive cardiac evaluation which showed normal
coronary arteries, moderate mitral stenosis with severe
pulmonary hypertension. Due to the above findings, she has been
referred for redo operation. Surgery however has been delayed to
due GI and pulmonary workup. After extensive preoperative
evaluation by GI and pulmonary, she has finally been cleared to
proceed with redo operation. Currently symptoms include
worsening fatigue and exertional dyspnea. She also complains of
intermittent chest pain, and occasional presyncope. She denies
orthopnea and lower extremity edema. ** Recently treated for
urinary tract infection with improvement in symptoms **

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2197-2-28**]:Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is
thinned out area at the septum primum consistent with previous
pericardial septal patch. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.0-1.5cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well functioning, bileaflet mechanical prosthesis in the
mitral position. Valvular MR is present which is appropriate in
quantity and location for this type of prosthesis. No flow
across the previous ASD repair is seen by color Doppler. The
study is otherwise unchanged from the prebypass period.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

MRA head [**2197-3-3**]:
FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the
evolving extensive right MCA territory infarction involving the
basal ganglia as well as the overlying cortex. The amount of
midline shift and subfalcine herniation remains stable. The
patient is status post right-sided hemicraniectomy. The
right-sided MCA branches are not well visualized. A small
extra-axial collection noted at the craniectomy site. The
calcifications noted in the left frontal periventricular white
matter are associated with mild amount of gliosis. There is no
edema. No significant signal dropout is seen on the gradient
echo images.

IMPRESSION:

No significant interval change in extensive evolving right MCA
infarction.
Small amount of blood products are noted relating to recent
surgery.

Left frontal periventricular calcifications do not demonstrate
enhancement or mass effect.

Final Report
INDICATION: 49-year-old female status post mitral valve
replacement.

COMPARISON: Multiple chest radiographs dating back to [**2-17**], [**2197**], most
recent [**2197-3-14**].

TECHNIQUE: Portable upright AP chest radiograph.

FINDINGS: There has been slight increase in lung aeration with
corresponding decrease in bibasilar atelectasis. There is no
pneumothorax or areas of focal consolidation concerning for
infection. There is unchanged cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
Right-sided PICC catheter is seen, unchanged in position in the
upper right atrium. Tracheostomy tube is seen unchanged in
position.  Sternotomy wires remain unchanged in alignment and
position with no obvious hardware failure.

edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2197-2-28**] and underwent redo sternotomy/Mitral valve
replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 44058**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve with
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
titrated insulin, propofol, and phenylephrine drips. She
developed neurologic deficits with L side weakness and R eye
deviation upon weaning of sedation. Neurology was consulted and
scanning revealed a right MCA distibution CVA. Intracranial
pressures necessitated craniotomy on [**2-28**] with neurosurgery. She
remained intubated and tube feeds were started. She required
manitol and eventually became more alert.  She had seizures
immediately following her stroke and was treated with Keppra and
Depakote.  The seizures resolved and the Depakote was
discontinued and the Keppra dose was decreased.
The patient continued to improve and was weaned down in the
ventilator.  She underwent a tracheostomy and open G-J tube
placement on [**3-14**] and has continued to wean.  Currently she is on
a trach collar during the day and CPAP on the vent at night.
She has tried the Passe-Muir valve once this week and will take
on to rehab with her.
Neurologically she moves all extremities spontaneously with the
exception of the LUE, and intermittently follows commands.  Her
staples from her craniotomy
