Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
49 y.o. man with MMP, incl ESRD, DM, CAD who presents with Left
leg lac and coagulopathy, for simple PD.  Pt appeared well, with

1) ESRD:  Pt was started on PD following admission. Course was
w/o absolute indications for dialysis or complications.
-
2) Hypotension:  Resolved with blood products and IVF at OSH so
likely due to hypovolemia.  No sign of sepsis.  BP remained

3) Leg laceration:  On admission no bleeding.  However, Hct had
dropped to 25 so patient was transfused to hct>30.  There did

discharge, patient was continued on [**12-9**] dose of coumadin, w/
plan to have level checked on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**5-3**].
-
4) Hypoglycemia/DM2:  Likely due to receiving insulin in setting
of decreased PO intake.  Euglycemic without insulin on
admission.

antihypertensives.  ? not on ASA.  Cont lasix, metolazone,
