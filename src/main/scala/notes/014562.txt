CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year-old
male who presented to an outside hospital with stuttering
chest pain, began at 9:30 on the morning of admission.  By
the afternoon the pain continued.  The pain did not radiate,
no shortness of breath or palpitations.  He was found to have
ST elevations in the inferior leads and transferred to
catheterization, which showed right coronary artery disease
and stented times two.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable post catheterization, but the patient had a poor
history of aspirin allergy so was transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit for aspirin desensitization and further monitoring.
 The patient was started on Lopressor, Plavix, morphine,
nitroglycerin and heparin at the outside hospital and also
Integrilin.  At the time of evaluation post catheterization
he is chest pain free without shortness of breath,
palpitations.  Nitro drip had been weaned off in the
catheterization laboratory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema.  The patient
reports he has no change in his activity level.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hiatal hernia.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin, which causes facial swelling as a young
adult.  Denies shortness of breath with this.

MEDICATIONS:  None at home.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies tobacco or alcohol abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission the patient
is afebrile.  Blood pressure 136/72.  Pulse 90.  Respiratory
rate 14.  98% 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general, he is well
developed, well nourished and in no acute distress.  HEENT
negative for any JVD.  Cardiovascular examination S1 and S2.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdominal examination was benign.
Extremities shows a right groin without hematoma or any
bruit.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.8,
hematocrit 35.5, platelets 240, chemistries show sodium 137,
potassium 3.5, chloride 106, bicarb 23, BUN 15, creatinine
0.8.  His initial CK was 1038 with an MB of 198 and troponin
of 1.72.  Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed
normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, left axis
deviation, ST elevations, 3 mm in the inferior leads, right
sided leads with no ST elevations or no ST changes and
positive Q waves also in the inferior leads.
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 69**]
shows sinus tachy to 101 with Q waves in leads 3, 2 and AVF.
Cardiac catheterization shows three vessel coronary disease
with left main carotid with 20% lesion distally, left
anterior descending coronary artery with tubular 50% lesion
proximally and diffuse 70% lesion distal to the major
diagonal.  Left circumflex had a large obtuse marginal one
with 50% stenosis and a moderate obtuse marginal two with 80%
lesion.  Finally right coronary artery had a proximal 40%
lesion and was totally occluded in the mid portion with
thrombus present.  His hemodynamics showed mildly elevated
left and right filling pressures with mean capillary wedge of
15, cardiac index of 2.9, right ventricular and diastolic
pressure of 12. The patient underwent stenting to mid to
distal right coronary artery times two.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery
disease, the patient was admitted for inferior ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  Cardiac catheterization at the time
of admission did show multivessel coronary artery disease,
but was felt that his right coronary artery lesion was his
culprit vessel.  He subsequently underwent successful right
coronary artery stenting times two and his CPKs ended up
trending down.  There was concern in the post catheterization
settings about his history of aspirin allergy.  The reason he
was in the Coronary Care Unit for aspirin desensitization,
which he tolerated quite well.  At the time of discharge he
was taking aspirin 325 once a day without difficulties or
signs of allergies.  He was also started on Plavix and
started empirically on Lipitor.  He was started on beta
blocker and also on a low dose ace inhibitor.  At the time of
discharge he was on Atenolol 50 mg q day and Lisinopril 5 mg
q day.  As mentioned above the patient now has known two
vessel coronary artery disease.  He is currently
asymptomatic.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in several
weeks time at which time possible discussions can be made
whether the patient will require additional revascularization
to his stenotic vessels.

Pump, on cardiac catheterization the patient was found to
have mildly elevated filling pressures.  He subsequently
underwent an echocardiogram, which show an ejection fraction
of 50 to 55% with distal inferior and apical hypokinesis.
There was also a suggestion of an impaired relaxation
possibly suggestive of diastolic dysfunction.  Although the
patient's catheterization showed mildly elevated filling
pressures he remained stable from a volume standpoint.  He
was autodiuresing at the time of his discharge.  He was
started on beta blockade and low dose Lisinopril as mentioned
above.

Hemodynamics, the patient remained hemodynamically stable
during his hospital course.

Rhythm, the patient remained in sinus rhythm during his
hospital course.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient remained stable during his
hospital course sating well on room air.

3.  Renal:  The patient's electrolytes remained stable during
hospital course with additions of an ace inhibitor tolerated
well.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  No issues.

5.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable
during hospital course.  He seemed to tolerate his aspirin
desensitization to aspirin without any evidence of allergic
reaction.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction status post
successful right coronary artery stent times two.
2.  Two vessel coronary artery disease stable.
3.  History of aspirin allergy status post successful
desensitization.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
3.  Lisinopril 5 mg po q day.
4.  Plavix 75 mg q day.
5.  Atenolol 50 mg q day.
6.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
7.  Senokot and Colace prn.
8.  Nitroglycerin prn.

FOLLOW UP:  He is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
three to four weeks time.
