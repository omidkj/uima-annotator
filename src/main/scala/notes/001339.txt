Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 40-year-old male with
no significant past medical history who presented to an
outside hospital on [**5-6**] with complaints of two to three
days of fever, cough productive of yellow sputum and
shortness of breath.  Oxygen saturations were 79% on room air
and the patient's vitals were blood pressure 152/72,
respiratory rate 24 to 30, heart rate 133, temperature of
96.3??????.  An arterial blood gas was performed which showed pH
7.46, PCO2 32, PO2 40.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral
infiltrates.  The patient was given intravenous levofloxacin,
ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Solu-Medrol.  The patient was
placed on 100% nonrebreather.  Approximately eight hours
later he was noted to have increased labored breathing and
his saturations were 87% to 88% on the 100% nonrebreather.
The patient was intubated at that time.  The patient's
admission labs at the outside hospital were noted for a
positive urine and serum toxicology screen for cocaine and
opiates, as well as a white count of 15.8 with 14% bands.

A PA line was placed at the outside hospital showing RA
pressure of 18, RV pressure of 42/15, PA pressure of 42/30
and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30.  Cardiology
was consulted and the patient was diuresed.  Repeat values
showed PA pressure 43/25 and a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 14.  According to reports, the patient became
agitated and required sedation which caused a drop in his
blood pressure.  The patient was started on Neo-Synephrine at
that time.  The patient also underwent bilateral lower
extremity ultrasounds which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis at the outside hospital.

On arrival, the patient's vent settings were AC of 18 with a
tidal volume of 700 and PEEP of 12.  The patient had received
fentanyl and had been paralyzed with vecuronium in transit.
His oxygen saturations were in the mid 90s on 100% FIO2.
Arterial blood gases on arrival showed pH of 7.29, PCO2 of 55
and PO2 of 82.  The Neo-Synephrine was weaned off quickly
without difficulty on presentation here.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient had bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates and hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
with very low PO2 to FIO2 ratio.  This was consistent with a
diagnosis of ARDS.  This is thought to be likely secondary to
pneumonia (although all sputum cultures have been negative)
or due to pneumonitis (the patient has a history of drug
use).  On presentation, the patient was paralyzed and
maintained on AC.  On [**5-8**], the ventilator mode was changed
to pressure control with a driving pressure of 25 and PEEP of
15.  A bronchoscopy was done that day in which BAL samples
were taken.  The airways showed minimal secretion and some
inflammation.  BAL studies are all negative at the time of
this dictation.  Due to elevated total pressures to
approximately 40, an esophageal balloon was placed on [**5-10**].  This showed a transpulmonary pressure of only 15,
indicating that the patient's elevated total pressures are
likely due to non pulmonary causes such as his marked
obesity.

Due to this finding, the patient's peak was elevated to 20.
On [**5-11**], the paralytics were discontinued and in the
following days a slow wean of the patient's driving pressure
was done.  This went well and on [**5-16**], the patient was
switched to pressure support ventilation and was able to
maintain excellent tidal volumes with a pressure support of
only 5.  By this time, his FIO2 had been weaned down to 40%
to 50%. Over the following days, a slow wean of the patient's
PEEP was done.  At the time of this dictation, the patient's
vent settings are a pressure support of 5, PEEP of 15 and
FIO2 of 50%.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially started on
empiric treatment for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia at the
outside hospital with Bactrim and steroids.  This was
continued here until the BAL samples were negative on [**5-8**].  The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and
levofloxacin to cover a pneumonia.  The vancomycin was
discontinued on [**5-11**] after five days when all cultures
were returning negative.  The patient completed a 10 day
course of levofloxacin on [**5-16**] as empiric coverage for
community acquired pneumonia.  On [**5-17**], the patient again
spiked temperatures to 101?????? to 102??????.  He was again pan
cultured.  All of this data is pending at the time of this
dictation.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is reported to have had a
wedge of 30 at the outside hospital.  This corrected with
diuresis and the patient's wedge pressures continued to be
normal here.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued on [**5-10**].  An echocardiogram was done on [**5-8**] which was a
suboptimal study due to body habitus positioning, but
indicated a normal ejection fraction.

4.  RENAL:  The patient had a mild creatinine bump to 1.5 at
presentation.  This is likely prerenal secondary to the brief
episode of hypotension at the outside hospital.  This quickly
resolved and there were no further renal issues.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient is not known to be a diabetic.
However, the patient had a hemoglobin A1C of 6.5 at the
outside hospital.  The patient was placed on an insulin drip
and continued on this for 10 days for aggressive blood sugar
control.  During this time, the patient required 4 units of
insulin an hour to maintain blood sugars in the 80 to 130
range.  On [**5-18**] (due to access issues) the insulin drip
was discontinued and the patient was placed on NPH with a
regular insulin sliding scale.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Initially, the patient was poorly
tolerating his tube feeds.  This resolved with the initiation
of standing Reglan.

NOTE:  This discharge summary covers the dates of [**5-7**] to
[**2131-5-18**].  Subsequent hospital course and discharge
information will be dictated by the intern taking over this
patient's care.
