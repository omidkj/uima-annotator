Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial Line placement

History of Present Illness:
79 F with insulin-dependent diabetes, CAD, PVD, s/p rt CEA in
fairly good health had abdominal discomfort and generally
feeling unwell for approximately 2 weeks. She states that she
has been feeling "tired and weak", staying in bed for most of
those two weeks. Denies any CP, Sob, N/V/D. Her daughter visited
her 2 days ago and reports that her mother was c/o mild
periumbilical abdominal aching, no N/V/D and appeared to be
dizzy.
.
Her family brought her to the [**Location (un) **] ED. In the ED, she was
pale diaphoretic and c/o of abd pain. Abd was found to be benign
but she had new EKG changes with ST elevations in anterior leads
and cardiac enzyme elevations: Trop 7.02, Ck 200's, MB 47. BP
mid 90's. Left IJ placed. She received approx 4l IVF for
hypotension and then developed pulmonary edema. BNP 1854. She
was diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and transfered to the CCU.
.
In the CCU, she was on neo at 40mcg per kg with improvement of
SBp to 97. An echo revealed an EF of 20%. Due to low BP, she was
also placed on dobutatime. She subsequently became very
tachycardic and was switched to dopamine. In addition, she was
found to have a leukocytosis of 40,000 but had already been
started on Ceftriaxone given hx of UTI's.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old female vasculopath, IDDM with acute anterior MI, EF
20% in cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema and leukocytosis.
.
# Cardiogenic shock: The patient was admitted from OSH diagnosed
with cardiogenic shock with BP 99/40 on levophed. Her AMI was
presumed to be completed with q waves as well as STE in V1-V4
although it was unclear if her [**Name (NI) **] had peaked. Over the course
of the next 16 hours, her CK's trended down. Because she was
initially stable, with presumed completed infarct and because of
her elevated creatinine, she was not taken for PCI immediately.
An echo was performed showing EF 20-30%, severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal/anterior
hypokinesis/akinesis and apical akinesis. A CXR showed
significant pulmonary edema. Echo and CXR as well as EKG and CE
c/w AMI indicated that the patient was most likely in
cardiogenic shock. She was started on a heparin drip for
anterior wall akinesis. She was also started on a lasix drip.
She was initially continued on levophed. As her mental status
and BP declined, milrinone was added to levophed. 1-2 hours
after starting milrinone her BP declined further to 80/30 with
MAP's in 40's, lactate started rising and her urine output fell
despite lasix. Milrinone and lasix were then discontinued.
Dopamine was initiated, but was soon discontinued when she
became tachycardic to HR 120's. Vasopressin was then initiated
in addition to levophed. During this time period, her pH fell
from 7.32 to 7.1 and her lactate rose from 1.6 to 4.3. As
pressors and ionotropes did not appear to be sufficient to
maintain her perfusion, it was decided to take the patient to
the cath lab for PCI and balloon pump. Initially, the family had
decided that they would be comfortable with a short trial of
aggressive measures but that the pt "did not want to live on
machines". Just prior to taking the patient to the cath lab, her
family made the decision not to pursue catheterization or a
balloon pump. They requested that she be made CMO. Pressors were
stopped. The patient died shortly thereafter.
.
# Respiratory Distress: On admission, the patient was in mild
respiratory distress and slightly hypoxic. After settingly in
and receiving morphine, the patient was comfortable on NC. A CXR
was obtained showing pulmonary edema likely [**12-23**] cardiogenic
shock. She received several lasix boluses and was then put on a
lasix drip. For several hours, she appeared relatively
comfortable, but as her mental status declined and blood
pressure fell, she became hypoxic and required increasing
amounts of oxygen and a NRB. She was also tachypnic. She
appeared to be increasing respiratory distress, with an ashen,
cyanotic appearance. Her ABG's showed a metabolic acidosis with
respiratory compensation. When her pH fell to 7.2, it was
decided to semi
