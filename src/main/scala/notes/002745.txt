[**2170-4-4**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two
vessel disease. The LMCA had a distal 60% stenosis. The LAD was
subtotally occluded in the proximal segment with TIMI 2 flow.
The LCx
had an 80% proximal stenosis. The RCA had mild disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart
filling
pressures with RVEDP 15 mmHg and PCWP 25 mmHg. There were
accentuated V
waves in the PCW pressure tracing. The pulmonary artery systolic

pressure was elevated at 50 mmHg. The cardiac index was
preserved at 2.5
L/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was normal. The
pulmonary
vascular resistance was elevated at 323 dyn-sec/cm5. There was
systemic
arterial normotension.
[**2170-4-4**] Intraop Echocardiogram:
PRE Bypass: Image quality is very poor. No transgastric views
could be obtained. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is grossly normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
[**Month/Day/Year 8813**] arch. The study is inadequate to exclude significant
[**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis. No [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is P2 flail of the posterior mitral
leaflet with a torn chordae visible.
POST Bypass: Patient is a-paced on phenylepherine and
epinepheine infusions. Image quality remains poor. No
transgastric views could be obtained. Biventircular appears
unchanged. There is a tissue valve in the mitral position. There
is no perivalvular leaks, no MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 86554**] intact.
Remaining exam is limited, but appears unchanged.

[**2170-4-15**] Discharge Chest X-ray:
As compared to the previous examination, there is status post
thoracocentesis on the right. There is marked decrease in extent
of the right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax can be seen on
the right. On the left, a basal air-fluid level suggests the
presence of minimal intrapleural air, despite the absence of
visibility of a left pneumothorax. No newly appeared focal
parenchymal opacities. Unchanged large hiatal hernia. Mild
cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented with shortness of breath and found to be hypoxic in
the setting of heart failure. He was rapidly worked up where an
echo revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation with partial
flail leaflet and torn chordae. He was then brought for a
cardiac catheterization which also revealed severe mitral
regurgitation along with coronary artery disease. In the setting
of respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability, it was
decided to bring him emergently to the operating room where he
underwent a mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass
graft. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring.  Remained on inotropes and pressors that were weaned
off over the first few days postoperatively, additionally had
episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter treated with
coumadin and amiodarone.  On post operative day two he was
successfully weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
Additionally renal was consulted due to acute kidney injury post
operatively.   He remained in the intensive care unit an
extended stay for hemodynamic management, pulmonary monitoring,
and renal management.  He progressively improved and was weaned
down to nasal cannula and hemodynamically stable off all
vasoactive medications.  Coumadin was held due to increased INR
and allowed to correct back on its own.  Renal function slowly
improved and he w
