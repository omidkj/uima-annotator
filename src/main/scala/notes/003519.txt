CTA chest  [**10-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Aortic dissection involving the descending thoracic aorta
([**Location (un) 11916**] B, deBakey III). No extension to involve the ascending
aorta is evident.
2. History of prior CABG corroborated.
3. There is severe emphysema with a persistent left pleural
effusion.
4. There is cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta.
Descending aorta intimal flap/aortic dissection.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild mitral
annular
calcification.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. While no clear dissection
flap is seen,
color Doppler imaging suggests a proximal descending aortic
dissection,
originating just distal to the origin of the left subclavian
artery. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
biventricular
systolic function. Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Descending aortic
dissection.

[**11-2**] Stress Thallium
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal LV cavity
size and
function.

[**11-4**] CTA head/neck
IMPRESSION:
1. Irregularity and narrowing along the V4 segment of the left
vertebral artery.
2. Mild/moderate right internal carotid artery stenosis at the
origin.
3. Atherosclerosis of bilateral carotids, most prominently at
the bulbs and cavernous portions.
4. Emphysema.





Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was admitted for CT to
evaluate aorta. His blood pressure was closely managed and
cardiology was consulted. CT revealed no change in his Type B
Dissection of his Aorta from prior study. Cardiac enzymes were
followed with no increase suggestive of cardiac event.  He was
further evaluated for endovascular stent and underwent
preoperative workup.  He was transferred to the floor and pain
resolved.  At this time declined surgery and was discharged home
a follow up CTA in 5 weeks and to call if pain returns.
