History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 2398**] [**Known lastname **] is a 70M with HIV (CD4 350 in [**5-8**]), SCC s/p RLL
lobectomy [**8-7**] complicated by bronchopleural fistula treated
with [**Last Name (un) 72968**] window, as well as empyema and invasive
aspergillosis treated with voriconazole referred from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Hospital1 8**] for hypotension and fever to 101.8.  He was recently
admitted from [**2147-8-7**] to [**2147-8-31**] with aspiration PNA, PCP
pneumonia and septic shock.  His antibiotic course of
vanco/cefepime/cipro was completed on [**2147-9-2**].  He subsequently
developed hypotension to 70/40, refractory to 5L IVF, on [**9-2**] the
day prior to admission.  This morning he was given doses of
vanco/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/cipro.

En route from [**Hospital3 **], he was hypotensive, so the
ambulance stopped at [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8**] ER.  Supposedly, no major
interventions were done (paperwork is now lost).

In the ED here at [**Hospital1 18**], VS were HR 110's, SBP 110-120's.  He
received hydrocortisone 100 mg IV.

Cannot review ROS with patient on arrival due to being on the
vent.

Pertinent Results:
ADMISSION LABS:
Notable for lipase 215, BUN10, Cr 0.3, WBC 15.7 with 4% bands,
Hct 25.4, plt 637
Lactate 1.0
AST: 97 ALT: 76 AP: 170 Tbili: 0.2
UA negative

IMAGING:
[**2147-9-3**] CT TORSO with contrast:
1. Small volume of pneumoperitoneum in the setting of interval
recnetly
placed percutaneous gastrostomy tube. Would correlate to the
timing of the
tube placement as this is a likely etiology if very recently
placed.
2. Widespread reticular and ground-glass opacities as well as
more dense
consolidation in the left lung, progressed from the recent
comparison study, concerning for infectious process.
3. Increased size and prevalence of multiple mediastinal lymph
nodes, possibly reactive given the findings in the lungs.
Followup upon resolution of symptoms is recommended.
4. Endobronchial material partially occluding the right mainstem
bronchus, slightly increased since the previous study.
5. Trace pelvic free fluid.
6. Numerous spinal compression deformities, similar to the
recent comparison.

[**2147-9-4**] BRONCHIAL WASHING:
-- negative for malignant cells

[**2147-9-7**] BARIUM STUDY via PEG to evaluate for reflux/aspiration:
No evidence of gastroesophageal reflux after injection barium
through the patient's PEG tube. However, patient cooperation is
required for complete evaluation for reflux and due to the
patient's waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] alertness, the study was limited.

[**2147-9-8**]: BILATERAL LENI's
No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.

[**2147-9-12**] CXR:
Multifocal consolidation of left lung is stable since [**2147-9-8**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo M h/o HIV, (CD4 350 in [**5-8**] and VL
undetect), SCC s/p RLL lobectomy [**8-7**] complicated by
bronchopleural fistula involving aspergillosis treated with
[**Last Name (un) 72968**] window- open to air, as well as empyema and invasive
aspergillosis treated with voriconazole referred from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Hospital1 8**] for hypotension and fever secondary to a recurrent
pneumonia.

# Hypotension/Pneumonia: He completed a 10 day course of
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and cefepime at rehab for HAP. Upon
admission, he was started empirically on vancomycin, meropenem
and ciprofloxacin, as well as voriconazole given his history of
aspergillus infection. He completed an eight day course of
vancomycin and meropenem. CT chest showed widespread reticular
and ground-glass opacities as well as more dense consolidation
in the left lung.  A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2147-9-4**] that
showed no evidence of malignancy or fungus. Bacterial cultures
were negative, however several bacterial and fungal cultures
were preliminary reports. Beta glucan test was >500 and
Galactomanan was negative on two separate measures. Given these
findings and the patient's history of aspergillus infection, the
Infectious Disease doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 2985**] the [**Name5 (PTitle) **] should remain on
life long voriconazole.
