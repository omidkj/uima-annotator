asthma exacerbation. Three weeks ago, she developed an asthma
exacerbation with a productive cough without fevers and
presented to her PCP who prescribed her a z-pack which the pt
completed. She had a CXR at that time which was negative for
pneumonia. She was placed on a 2 week prednisone taper starting
at Prednisone 60mg. Her symptoms improved back to baseline. 3
days ago pt went outdoors and developed sx of seasonal
allergies, which triggered her current asthma exacerbation. She
went to the Red Sox game yesterday which made her allergy sx
worse. Over the past 3 days she has been increasing SOB and
requiring frequent nebs. Pt states that she has a productive
cough. Denies fevers, chills.
.
ROS: Negative for chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abd pain,
diarrhea, dysuria.

In the ED, initial vitals were T98.6, p114, 168/77, rr17, 97%RA.
Pt was given solumedrol 125mg IV, alb/atrovent albuterol nebs,
continuous nebs, magnesium, terbutaline with relief of her
symptoms and plans to admit to the floor. Peak flow improved
from 230 to 260 (270 is baseline; 300 on very good day). Then,
her symptoms worsened, prompting ICU admission. She also
received CTX and azithromycin, 1L NS.
.

that her breathing is mildly worse than baseline. Her current
peak flow remains at 260.
