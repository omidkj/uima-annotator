EKG: sinus tach at 115bpm, NA/NI, poor R wave progression.

Imaging:
[**10-20**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology

[**10-21**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This EEG telemetry did not capture any
pushbutton events for seizures. It was a 3.5 hour extended
routine study. There was
present two relatively short duration periods of what appeared
to be
perhaps slow wave sleep activity. It could not be determined
based upon
patient's clinical state since she appeared to lie relatively
motionless
throughout the entire record. The impression essentially is that
this
is a normal awake and breakthrough sleep study. No clear
epileptic
activity was identified.

[**10-22**] AP CXR: The nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Previous pulmonary edema has
largely cleared. Greater opacification at the right lung base
could be atelectasis or pneumonia. Right internal jugular
infusion port ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax. Pleural
effusion is minimal if any.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 y.o woman with history of multiple sclerosis, central and
obstructive sleep apnea who is now post-op s/p T-tube placement.
.
#Trach-tube placement - the patient underwent placement of a
Hebeler T-tube for evidence of tracheal collapse above her
previous tracheostomy tube.  The procedure was without
complication, and the patient was kept overnight for
observation.  Care for the tube should include [**Hospital1 **] saline
flushing with 5mL and suctioning.  Cap during the day and uncap
during the night with humidified trach mask.  The patient was
also started on mucinex for mucous control.
[**10-22**] the patient had a rigid bronchoscopy by IP that showed
severe inflammation. During the procedure the patient had mucous
plugging resulting in severe hypoxia. Afterwards she was treated
with 4 days of Solumedrol 40mg Q4hrs and 5 days of Vanc/Zosyn to
try to reduce the swelling. She was kept in the ICU in case of
repeat plugging episode. On [**10-26**] her T-tube was replaced with
#7 uncuffed. Patient tolerated procedure well. She was restarted
on regular diet after the procedure.

# Unresponsiveness episodes: Early AM of [**10-20**], the patient
became unresponsive during an albuterol nebulizer treatment.
Code blue was called, however she was never pulseless or apneic.
Her vital signs were stable and she did not get chest
compressions. ABG showed hypercarbia with pCO2 70, however this
was not high enough to explain her symptoms, given her baseline
in the 50s and 60s. Head CT negative. EEG showed no seizure
activity. Her mental status exam slowly improved over the next
two to three days to the point the patient was at baseline.
Initially she complained of being unable to move her body except
for blinking, followed by inability to move the left side of her
body. Neurology was consult, who felt that that her neurology
exam was inconsistent, and this was likely caused by a
conversion disorder. Psychiatry was consulted, who felt the
patient was at a high risk for a psychiatric event, but that
this was a diagnosis of exclusion. She had one further even the
night of [**10-22**] lasting about 10 minutes, that resolved
spontaneously. She had no further episodes. We held her abilify
given self-reported dizziness, in concert with psychiatry
consult. She will need follow up with psychiatry as outpatient.
.
#. Nutrition: after the bronch [**10-22**] the patient had trouble
swallowing solids. The patient had to be NPO for several days,
so an NG tube was placed and tube feeds were started. She was
seen by speech and swallow after replacement of her tube , who
recommended regular diet.
