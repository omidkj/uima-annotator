Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Chest tube placement
Pericardial window and drain
Dobhoff placement by IR
HD temporary line placement
HD tunnelled line placement

History of Present Illness:
31 year old male h/o liver [**First Name3 (LF) **] age 5 [**12-27**] biliary atresia
and subsequent cirrhosis, ESRD [**12-27**] GN on HD presents with chief
complaint of left chest pain when he coughs, non productive, no
hemoptysis, no fever or chils.  He states that the pain is sharp
and pleuritic.  His CP does not radiate.  He also complains of
abdominal pain which is chronic in nature.  He denies
constipation or diarrhea.  He has SOB at rest and 2 pillow
orthopnea.  No nausea or vomiting.
.
He denies any other symptoms, at the current moment the patient
would like only to sleep, and is asking for benadryl.
.
In the ER his initial VS were: T 97.6 HR 72 BP 122/83 RR 24 O2
sat: 96% RA.  He rec'd 1 L IVF in total in the ER.  He was also
mildly hypoglycemic in the ER and rec'd 2 amps of D50.  He had a
WBC of 20 and therefore had a CT of his torso, this revealed
possible colonic thickening, possible focal enhancement of the
kidney.  He rec'd vanc/zosyn/flagyl.  His VS prior to transfer
to the ICU was HR 110, RR 23, BP 113/73 92% RA.  Access is HD
line and 18g x 1.

[**2136-2-13**] HD Catheter tip cx: MSSA
.
IMAGING:
.
[**2136-2-11**] CT head: No acute intracranial process. Consider MRI
given the patient's history of prior infarcts if clinically
warranted.
.
[**2136-2-11**] CXR: Congestive heart failure, large left pleural
effusion. Follow up post-diuresis is recommended
.
[**2136-2-11**] CT abdomen:
1. Large left pleural effusion which is incompletely imaged with
complete
collapse of the left lower lobe and visualized lingula. Right
lower lobe
probable early pneumonia and/or fluid overload.
2. Apparent wall thickening of collapsed descending colon,
sigmoid and rectum may represent mild colitis; however, this may
also be secondary to
underdistension.
3. Interval decrease in ascites. Persistent body wall and
mesenteric edema, likely secondary to underlying liver disease.

4. Cirrhosis with stigmata of portal hypertension.
5. L5 spondylolysis.
.
[**2136-2-16**] TEE: No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or
right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is
a small pericardial effusion. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. No evidence of
vegetation on right atrial line. Small pericardial effusion with
no evidence of right atrial or right ventricular collapse.
.
[**2136-2-19**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The pericardium
may be thickened. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
[**2136-2-21**] TTE: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Very smal
