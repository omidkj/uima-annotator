Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH of tachy-brady syndrome, mitral regurgitation,
and CML, presents with 4-5 days of worsening SOB, wt gain, and
LE edema. He went to his PCP's office today for evaluation and
was found to be in rapid afib with HR in the 120s-130s. His PCP
did an EKG which confirmed rapid afib, frequent ectopy, and new
ST depressions. He was felt to have crackles on exam and was
given 20mg PO lasix. The patient was sent to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, his VS were T 97.5, BP 134/37, HR 124, RR 30, sats
93% on RA and 96% on 3L. He was given a full dose ASA and 10mg
IV diltiazem with no change in his HR. He received a total of
30mg IV diltiazem which eventually brought his HR down to the
90s, but it caused transient hypotension as well, with SBP in
the 80s. He was given IVF to improve his BP after the diltiazem.
He was also given 30mg PO diltiazem to attempt to keep his rate
under control. CXR was performed which revealed slightly
worsening pulmonary edema and loss of the R heart border,
concerning for fluid vs. consolidation. His O2 sats continued to
be in the low 90s on 3L so he was bumped up to 6L by nc. He
continued to have frequent ectopy and was sent to the floor with
his HR still in the 100s.
.
On arrival to the floor, his HR was in the 110s and his O2 sat
was 89% on 5L by nc. He was felt by his RN to be awake, alert
and appropriate, asking for food. Approximately 1-2 hours after
arrival, his sats began to drop to the low 80s on 5L by nc. His
O2 sats were difficult to monitor given his frequent ectopy, so
he was put on a face mask with 10L O2. He was difficult to
arouse and was somewhat disoriented. An ABG was performed which
was 7.45/33/59, with a lactate of 1.4. He was placed on a NRB
with improvement in his sats to the mid 90s. Repeat cardiac
enzymes were sent. A foley catheter was placed with 400cc of UOP
immediately. He was given 10mg IV lasix and 5mg IV lopressor.
His BP remained in the low 100s and his HR came down to the 90s
transiently. Repeat CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema, but no
frank infiltrate. His mental status did improve somewhat and he
was able to converse with me to confirm his symptoms, but he
remained tachypneic with a RR in the 30s.
.
He was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring. On arrival
to CCU his BP was 100/60, HR 100-115, RR 30, Pox 95% on NRB. He
was mentating well and had no complaints. We discussed
intubation and cardiovesion, however pt wanted to wait a few
days. Given his BL BP is around 100/60 we opted to give another
dose of lopressor 5 mg IV. His BP dropped to 87/65. A heparin
drip was also started.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted in late [**Month (only) 958**] to
early [**Month (only) 547**] for chest pressure. He was r/o by three sets, a CXR
was normal and his CP was thought to be related to anxiety. He
continued to have arrythmyia c/w his tachy-brady syndrome. His
BB was held and he was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7965**] who did not feel a
PCM was indicated at this time. His TSH was slighlty elevated
but there was concern over med complicane so his prior dose was
resumed. Prior to this, in mid [**Month (only) 958**], the patient was admitted
for syncope and hypoxia and required a MICU stay, but no
intubation. He had a holter in [**Month (only) 958**] that showed asymptomatic
ectopic atrial beats and 25 isolated VPBs with 6 couplets and
two 3-beat runs of VT, rate 110 BPM.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with a pmh of tachy-brady syndrome, mild
mitral regurgitation, and CML, who presented with 5 days of SOB
and was found to be in afib with RVR and CHF and borderline BPs.
the patient was intubated and cardioverted for his atrial
fibrillation. He was converted to NSR with frequent ectopy.
After extubation, Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] became porgressively short of
breath. After discussion with his health care proxy, the
decision was made to focus on comfort. M. [**Known lastname 13318**] expired
surrounded by his friends and family.
.
1) CAD: No history of CAD. started low dose aspirin. cycled
enzymes which were negative.
.
2) Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with RVR. Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] had a h/o
tachy-brady and possible atrial tachycardia versus flutter in
old notes. During this stay he did not tolerate the A.fib with
RVR and became hypoxic due to a CHF exacerbation. He was
tranferred to the CCU for respiratory distress. In the CCU the
patient was intubated for respiratory distress and was loaded
amiodarone and with cardioverted to a NSR with frequent ectopy.
.
3) Congestive heart failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] had diastolic dysfunction
and CHF which was probably the result of overall poor cardiac
function and his history of tachy-brady and his atrial
fibrillation. A repeat echo showed significantly worse cardiac
function with an EF of approximately 10%. He was aggresively
diuresed. After discussion with his physicians and health care
proxy, the decision was made to extubate Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**]. He became
progressively short of breath. Morphine was given to relieve his
dyspnea. His HCP made the decision to focus on comfort measures.
.
4) CML: Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] was continued on hydroxyurea during his stay.
