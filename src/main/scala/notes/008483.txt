~~~~~~~~~Radiology
CXR [**9-8**]
FINDINGS: Pulmonary catheter noted with tip overlying the
expected region of the pulmonary artery. Nasogastric tube is
curled in the fundus. Left-sided chest tube noted with air space
consolidation surrounding the entry, possibly corresponding to
small pulmonary contusion. Two mediastinal chest tubes noted in
normal position. Endotracheal tube identified in normal position
approximately 4 cm proximal to the carina. Mild mediastinal
widening is expected postoperatively.

IMPRESSION: Normal postoperative changes with correct
positioning of lines and tubes.

CXR [**9-11**]
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidations most likely due to
atelectasis but infectious process cannot be excluded. Bilateral
small pleural effusion.

CXR [**9-13**]
FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change versus prior
with continued bilateral effusions. No new consolidations.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ECHO [**9-8**]  Intra-op TEE
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to
moderate ([**12-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is in sinus rhythm and is receiving an infusion
of
phenylephrine
1. A bioprosthesis is seen well seated in the Aortic
position.Leaflets moare
mvoing well. Trace AI is noted. A calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.2 cm2 is
obtained by
continuity. A mean gradient of 40 mm of Hg is noted.
2. Aorta is intact
3. Other findings are unchanged
