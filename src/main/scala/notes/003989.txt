52-year-old female with history of alcoholic and hepatitis B
cirrhosis, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on
[**12-15**] folling treatment for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. She was seen in clinic today and was found with

previously smoking one pack per day for a total of 40 years.
The patient is a former drinker with her last drink being on
[**2155-3-29**]. She was drinking approximately four to six packs of

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with hep B/ETOH cirrhosis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC paracentesis please send cell count
and differential, fluid for culture
PARACENTESIS ON [**12-29**]

CLINICAL HISTORY: ETOH cirrhosis. Diagnostic tap requested.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: A full discussion of pertinent risks,
benefits, and alternatives to the procedure was performed,
informed consent was obtained. Preprocedure timeout documents
proper patient, site, and procedure.

Using aseptic technique and ultrasound guidance, a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 11097**]
centesis catheter was passed through anesthetized tissues in the
left flank, to the peritoneal cavity from which approximately 1
liter of clear, straw-colored fluid was removed and sent for the
requested labs.

Hemostasis was then obtained, patient tolerated the procedure
well without any immediate post-procedure complications.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4401**] performed the procedure.

IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2157-1-1**] 5:41 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: assess for loculation

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with cirrhosis with large ascites, tap with
only 1L removed, assess for loculation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for loculation
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: not needed

INDICATION: 52-year-old female with cirrhosis and large ascites
with recent 1 liter of fluid removed via paracentesis. Assess
for loculation.

COMPARISON: [**2156-11-3**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
were obtained with IV contrast. Multiplanar reformations were
performed.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a moderate right pleural
effusion with associated atelectasis. There is airspace opacity
within the left lung base, likely atelectasis.

The liver is small and nodular consistent with cirrhosis.
Metallic clips are present within the gallbladder fossa,
consistent with prior cholecystectomy. The previously seen early
enhancing lesions within the liver are not well demonstrated,
given the lack of arterial phase timing. The pancreas and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. The spleen is bulky, measuring
13 cm. The small bowel is filled with oral contrast with no
evidence of obstruction. The large bowel is unremarkable. The
rectum and sigmoid colon are stool filled.
There is moderate amount of ascites located primarily along the
pericolic gutters and extending down into the deep pelvis. There
are no obvious septations or collection surrounded by soft
tissue to suggest loculation.

This examination is limited due to artifact created from the
patient's body habitus, particularly on the right of the abdomen
and pelvis.

There is diffuse anasarca throughout the subcutaneous tissues of
the abdomen and pelvis.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The uterus and adnexa are
unremarkable. The urinary bladder is collapsed and contains a
Foley catheter.

There is no appreciable lymphadenopathy in the abdomen and
pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No loculation. Majority of fluid within the pericolic gutters
and extending down into the deep pelvis.

2. Moderate right pleural effusion.

3. Cirrhotic liver and splenomegaly.
.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular function. Normal right
ventricular function. Moderately elevated estimated pulmonary
pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-11-3**],
the estimated pulmonary pressures are moderately elevated and
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN

Reason: EVAL FOR ASCITES AND MARK THE SPOT FOR PARACENTESIS

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with EtOH, Hep B cirrhosis, refractory
ascites.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please assess for degree of ascites. Anasarca vs. ascites.
LIMITED ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND

COMPARISON: None.

HISTORY: Ascites.

FINDINGS: Limited [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale imaging of the abdomen was
performed to assess for underlying ascites. Minimal amounts of
fluid are seen in all four quadrants and midline pelvic view.
Subsequently, no spot was marked due to
