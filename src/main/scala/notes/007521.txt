Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo man with CAD, PVD, valvular heart dz s/p bioprosthetic AVR
and MRV, on coumadin for atrial fibrillation who presents with
melena and symptomatic anemia.  Stabilized with transfusions and
bleeding stopped.  No sources found on upper or lower scopes.
Patient was bridged on coumadin for high risk afib (CHADS 4),
and then discharged home with follow up for outpatient capsule
endoscopy.
.
# GI bleeding: Given his history of melena for 3-4 days prior to
admission, upper source was suspected. His anticoagulation was
reversed with 5 mg of PO vitamin K.  He was transfused a total
of 3 U FFP and 4 U PRBC in the ED/MICU.  His INR trended down to
1.3 and his HCT came up to 28 and stablized. By AM after
admission, patient felt much better and an EGD showed no obvious
source of bleeding.  He had a colonoscopy that was unrevealing
of any source.  His hct remained stable and he had normal stools
that were guiac negative.   A CT scan showed no arterio-enteric
fistulas.  Plan is for outpatient capsule endoscopy.
.
# CAD: Patient has no stents.  No recent angina.  BB and ASA
held initially.  Restarted once on the floor and BP was stable
and patient stopped bleeding.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: rate controlled, anticoagulation reversed
as above.  After colonoscopy and when hct had stabalized,
heparin gtt was started and coumadin was restarted.  His INR was
trended daily and the heparin was stopped and when his INR was
2.0 on the day of discharge.  He was sent home on his usual
regimen on 3 mg, 3 mg, 1.5 mg cycle.  He will have his INR
checked the day after discharge and follow up with his PCP.
.
# h/o CHF with Valvular heart disease: s/p bioprosthetic AVR &
MVR. Clinically, he appears euvolemic after transfusions.
Lisinopril & BB were held initially given hypotension, but then
restarted on the floor.  He was on 20 lasix at home, which was
also held initially.  He developed some mild pedal edema and
lasix 40 mg was given for 2 days and then he was discharged on
his home does.  He had no pedal edema on discharge.
.
# h/o stroke/carotid disease: stable, anticoagulated as above,
no changes to regimen.
.
# emphesema: continued home inhalers.
.
# OSA: should be evaluated for CPAP as an outpatient.
.
# AV fistula: on CT scan, a known AV fistula was seen again in
his R groin.  Has been present since after cath in [**Month (only) 956**].
Was initially seen by vascular surgery at that time and no
intervention was needed.  An email was sent to both the
cardiologist who did that cath and the vascular surgeon who had
evaluated him in [**Month (only) 956**] that it was still present.  As he was
asymptomatic, it was decided that he could have outpatient
follow up and probably would not need an intervention unless
symptoms changed.
