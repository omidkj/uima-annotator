none


History of Present Illness:
Patient presented to ED with increased SOB and abdominal girth
over the past 3 days with subjective fevers. She reports
increased nausea with poor po intake but no diarrhea, melena or
hematochezia. She also reports cough productive of bloody sputum
for the last two days. She dnies any dysuria, hematuria,
frequency or urgency.
In the ED she was febrile and hypotensive and was given 4L NS
with improved hypotension but developed respiratory distress.
CXR was c/w PNA with superimposed CHF so she was given 20mg IV
lasix X 2 with good effect. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.
Pt initially hypotensive in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], receiving stress dose steroids
until home doses were available. No documented fevers. Pt states
her breathing is now improved.

Past Medical History:
Onc hx:
Initially presented with mole at her left flank which grew and
turned black. She underwent a resection of a 12.5-mm thick
ulcerated melanoma from her left abdominal wall in [**Month (only) 958**] of
[**2145**]. She underwent wide local excision and sentinel node
biopsy, with melanoma present in one of four inguinal sentinel
lymph nodes. On [**2146-5-11**], she underwent complete left inguinal
node dissection, with no melanoma in three remaining lymph
nodes. She was enrolled in intergroup protocol S0008 and was
randomized to the biochemotherapy arm. She received three cycles
of biochemotherapy initiated on [**2146-7-11**]. Following that
therapy, she developed a psychotic depression, which fully
resolved on antidepressant therapy. CT scans in [**Month (only) 116**] showed
possible bilateral pulmonary nodules. PET scans in [**Month (only) **]
confirmed metastatic disease in the lungs, liver, and bone and a
head MRI showed multiple small CNS metastases. Upon
documentation of this CNS metastases, she was referred to
Neuro-Oncology for evaluation. She underwent an LP, which
disclosed no evidence of leptomeningeal disease. Because of
multiple CNS lesions and skull metastasis, she was started on
whole brain radiation in early [**Month (only) 205**]. She completed her treatment
last Wednesday.

CT: Marked interval progression of metastatic disease -
innumerable new liver mets with hepatomegaly, new adrenal mets,
splenic mets, intraperitoneal seeding with ascites, breast
nodules, lungs mets, diffuse alveloar opacities likely
represents lymphatic spread of tumor with interstitial edema, no
obstruction, focal consolidation in right lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hypotension - resolved following initial hydration with 4L IVF
in ED.  No further episodes of hypotension. Pt initially on
stress dose steroids, later switched to home dose of decadron
2mg [**Hospital1 **].

Respiratory distress - initial shortness of breath worsened
after IVF but improved after some lasix.  CXR consistent with
pneumonia given hx of fevers and cough, but metastatic spread
also possible.  Pt remained afebrile in hospital.  Started on
levo/flagyl.  Pt was chronically oxygen dependent, stable on 4L
per nasal cannula

Ascites - pt tolerating discomfort, does not want therapeutic
tap at this time, likely would reccur quickly.

Anemia: some vague hx of vaginal bleeding. No other known
bleeding. Received 2 units pRBC during hospitalization.  No
bleeding noted in hospital.

Depression: Continued on home Zoloft and Risperidone.

Metastatic Melanoma - prognosis dire, after discussion between
hematology/oncology and pt and her family, it was decided that
pt would go home with hospice care.
