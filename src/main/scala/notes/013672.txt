Chief Complaint:
status epilepticus


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 3403**] [**Known lastname 110699**] is a 47 year-old man with a history of severe
intellectual disabilty (non-verbal at baseline) who was
transferred from home to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital in NH after reportedly
having whole body shaking (unknown duration). Records indicate
that he was given 1 mg of Ativan in addition to a load of
Fosphenytoin at 1200 PE x1. He continued to having shaking
movements and was intubated and sedated on propofol and
medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the ED off of propofol he continues to
have rhythmic shaking of his left arm more than the right.

Neurosurgery was consulted regarding his VP shunt and could not
palpate a reservoir. A shunt series was ordered, but CT from
outside showed a stable level of hydrocephalus from prior
images.

A stat portable EEG was done in the ED which showed frequent
rhythmic right fronto-temporal discharges. ED ordered Flagyl and
Levaquin in the ED - but these infusions were stopped prior to
administration. He was started on Vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

In the chart it indicates that he was most recently admitted to
[**Location (un) 8641**] with a pseudomonas UTI. He has no known history of
seizures and is not currently on any AEDs as per medical
records.

At transfer out of NeuroICU:
Doesn't react well with male examiners (hx of trauma by males in
past), macrocephaly/dysmorphic facial features. Eyes spon open,
track occasionally, dysconjugate gaze, nonverbal and does not
follow commands. moves b/l arms and feet spontaneously, resists
passive leg movement (appear spastic, may be realted to trauma
hx) but pt is able to move legs voluntarily, bilateral hands
also spastic.
