65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including

COPD, post tracheostomy and [**Year (4 digits) 282**] placement(respiratory failure
due to pneumonia) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, now
presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from
records. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-26**] after an admission
at [**Hospital1 18**] for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his
admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to
the commode with assistance. On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic
and then gradually unresponsive. On [**4-12**], his BP decreased to
60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received
a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained
unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an
FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple
lumen was placed [**2179-3-21**].
.
Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide
additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well
until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able
to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on
Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was
maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend.
Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked "very scared"
and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his
eyes "rolling back in his head". He was occasionally responsive
to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the
last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed
the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was
slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very
diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen.
The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she
reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to
a skin tear on the right.

initially started on levophed for hypotension. However, after
learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally

studies:
ECG- Sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute. Nonspecific ST-T wave
changes but no major changes since previous studies.
.
CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right
lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal
contours toward the right consistent with previous
pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural
effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left
lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal
consolidation.
.
Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or
evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA.
