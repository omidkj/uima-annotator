Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old with a history of prior angioedema
admitted with another episode of angioedema, possibly secondary
to ACEI.

1)Angioedema: Patient presented with tongue and lip swelling. He
has a history of angioedema on the past but has remained on
Lisinopril for several months now. He has also undergone testing
for C1 esterase inhibitor, which was negative. On admission to
the MICU, the ace-inhibitor was stopped as well as his
Doxazosin. The latter unlikely caused his symptoms. He was
started on IV steroids, H2 blocker, and benadryl. His swelling
improved after 24 hours. He was asymptomatic while on the floor.
 We discussed with the patient that the Lisinopril was likely
reponsible for his angioedema and apologized for placing him
back on the medication on his previous discharge.  A translator
was present for this discussion.

2)UTI: He is currently being treated for ESBL e.coli UTI with
Meropenem. He was discharged on Ertapenem for his last 3 days of
therapy.

3)Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely pre-renal since his
creatinine improved with IVFs. His diuretic regimen was held.
Lasix and Metolazone were restarted without incident prior to
discharge.

4)Type 2 DM: Patient is on Metformin at home. The decision was
made to stop this regimen given that the patient intermittently
goes into acute renal failure and the risk for lactic acidosis.
He was placed on an insulin sliding scale.

5)CAD: Continued on ASA and BB

6)Hyperlipidemia: Continued on statin

7)CHF: His outpatient regimen of Lasix & Metalozone were held in
the setting of acute renal failure.  They were restarted before
discharge.

8)Prostate Cancer:  The patient had no acute issues during this
stay.  He has appointments next week to follow up with Oncology.
 We attempted to schedule a bone scan but were not able to
coordinate it on this stay.
