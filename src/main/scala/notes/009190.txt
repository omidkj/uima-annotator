History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 95472**] is a 69 yo left handed woman who presents for
evaluation of worsening weakness.   The patient is accompanied
by
her friend who assists in this history.

Ms. [**Known lastname 95472**] reports felling well up until approximately 3 months
ago.  At that time she and some of her close friends noticed a
change in her voice.  A few weeks after this was noticed, the
patient fell on her face and her speech became worse.  She
thought this was secondary to injury but the speech did not
improve as her injuries did.  It was suspected that she
sustained
a small stroke and she began speech therapy.  However, the
patient continued to fall quite frequently.  She noted a
longstanding problem with balance and was seen in neurology
clinic where she was initial thought to have significant
cervical
spine disease causing myelopathy and sensory loss.  A Head CT
and
CT of the c-spine where without evidence of major abnormalities.


Over the month of [**Month (only) **], the patient noted an intermittent
cough on thin liquids and over several weeks this developed into
a very strong gag reflex and difficulty swallowing. An MRI
without contrast on [**2164-10-24**] was unremarkable.  She continued to
fall and her speech continued to worsen.  Concern was raised for
ALS and an outpatient EMG was arranged which showed an extensive
sensorimotor polyneuropathy.  The patient was again seen in
neurology and at this point her exam had changed significantly
with worsening muscle weakness, evidence of fasculations and
prominent speech alteration.  The patient had plans for
follow-up
in the [**Hospital 7817**] clinic in 2 weeks.

In the meantime, the patient reports increasing instability.
She
now finds it difficult to lift her legs to walk any considerable
distance.  She is unable to tolerate a normal diet and has
mostly
been eating soups and ensure with notable weight loss.   She is
undergoing physical and speech therapy without improvement.  She
was gagging nearly every time she spoke, but this appears to
have
subsided.  Her friends are concerned for her safely at home and
the patient states she can no longer care for herself.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denied headache,
loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia.  She denies
lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denied
difficulties comprehending speech or parasthesiae. She has
chronic urinary incontinence and wears pads.  She denies bowel
incontinence or retention.  She denies any noticeable muscle
cramps or uncontrolled movements. On general review of systems,
the patient denied recent fever or chills.  She endorses recent
weight loss secondary to inability to tolerate solid foods.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. She did have a left breast lump
2-3 months ago which was felt to be a hematoma from a fall and
this has resolved.  She reports frequent bouts of cellulitis but
denies recent rashs, skin lesions.  She is persistently fatigued
and endorses anxiety over her symptoms.  Further ROS was
negative.
