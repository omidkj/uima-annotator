Brief Hospital Course:
57 year-old male with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus
type II, end-stage renal disease presenting with fever likely
due to pneumonia and multifactorial hypoxia.
.
1. Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial due to pneumonia, fluid
overload after missing hemodialysis, anemia, and history of
smoking. The patient received antibiotics as above for
pneumonia. The patient's BNP was [**Numeric Identifier **] on admission; the patient
was dialyzed to remove fluid. The patient was given one unit
packed red blood cells for anemia. The patient was advised to
stop smoking. The patient's oxygen saturation was 96% on room
air and 91% with ambulation on discharge.
.
2. Fever: The patient was afebrile since admission. The fever
was likely due to pneumonia given the patient's productive cough
and x-ray findings versus viral bronchitis. The patient was
initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin which was
changed to levofloxacin prior to discharge to complete a
seven-day course. There was initial concern for line infection
and the patient was treated with vancomycin but this was
discontinued once cultures remained negative for greater than 72
hours. Urine culture was negative. No stools studies were sent
as the patient's diarrhea had resolved prior to admission.
.
3. Chest pain: The patient's left-sided chest discomfort was due
to his tunnelled catheter. The patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction on admission.
.
4. Coronary artery disease: No active issues. The patient was
continued on an ACE-inhibitor
