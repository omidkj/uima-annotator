History of Present Illness:
86 y/o female with DM2, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Breast Ca who
presents with chest tightness. Reports that she has been having
SSCP off and on for several weeks. Pain is unrelated to exertion
or food. There is no radiation, although she reports some
associated back pain today. Has associated nausea and vomited
today. Denies SOB, diaphoresis. Pain not pleuritic. Also
reported transient right ankle swelling. Uses pepcid which helps
the discomfort. Had a cardiac cath about 3 yrs ago which showed
40% narrowing of the proximal LAD w/ at least 40% stenosis 1st
diagonal, tortuosity of the epicardial coronary vessels [**3-12**] HTN,
nl LV size, function and contraction pattern; this was medically
managed. She had no change in these symptoms but called her PCP
here in [**Name9 (PRE) 86**] today who sent her to the ED due to above sx.
.
At this time, the patient denies frank CP, chest tightness, n/v,
sob, or HA but does report a tightness at the skin level that
she compares to a tight brazier.
.
In ED, received IV hydral 10mg X 1, mucomyst, bicarb, esmolol
gtt and nipride gtt.  CT [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and recommended
medical management.  Has not yet received regular PM meds.

CTA chest:
1. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta with
diffuse irregularity of the aortic wall contour with multiple
possible areas of penetrating ulceration notably with a
penetrating ulcer located in the descending thoracic aorta at
the level of the tracheal bifurcation after the take off of the
great vessels.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3. Small right thyroid nodule.
...
ECG: Sinus brady @ 54bpm w/ prolonged QTc @ .452 and LAD.
Flipped T in II, 1mm ST elevation V2, 2mm ST elevation in V3 old
compared to [**2160-1-12**].  Interpreation: LAD w/LAFB and LVH.  No
ischemia.
.
Bil LENIs: No DVT
.
[**7-11**] echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 86 y/o female with DM, HTN, and high chol presented with
extensive ulcerated atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and
with intermittent chest pain and poorly controlled blood
pressure.
.
Chest pain: Diff dx at presentation included angina, dissection
(given high BP), PE (+Ddimer, ?right ankle swelling, relatively
recent plane trip), GI cause (relieved by pepcid).  2w time
course was felt most c/w GERD and most concerning for slow
dissection.  Ultimately felt likely [**3-12**] GERD, HTN.
- Ruled out for MI with serial enzymes, EKGs
- Continued ASA, bblocker, statin
- Agressive BP control as below in detail
- CTA negative for PE; FU CTA 1month for atherosclerotic
lesions; negative LENI studies
-PPI
-Plan for atherosclerotic lesions is repeat CTA in one month and
followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
.
HTN: Likely [**3-12**] RAS.  RA US performed pre-DC for better
characterization to aid outpatient managment.  Much improved on
HCTZ, and labetalol with [**Last Name (un) **] added on day of DC.  Control still
not optimal; to be seen as epi @ [**Company 191**] this week, with likely
addition of CCB at that time.
.
CRI: Cr at baseline.
.
LE swelling- In context of positive D-Dimer in a patient w/hx
malignancy, was concerning for DVT; LENIs negative.  Likely mild
CHF.
.
DM: HSS, [**Doctor First Name **] diet
.
FC
.
FEN- Cardiac/DM diet
.
PPx- SQ heparin, PPI
.
Access- Currently PIV
