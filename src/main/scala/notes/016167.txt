History of Present Illness:
In brief this is a 63yo M PMHx HD dependent ESRD s/p failed
allograft, CAD s/p CABG ([**2156**] - LIMA to LAD, SVG to RPDA, SVG to
OM1, SVG to ramus), PVD, HTN, HLD, sCHF (EF 20-30%) who was
admitted for elective cardiac catheterization [**12-22**], notable for
occluded OM graft, patent LIMA, SVG-PDA and SVG-ramus grafts,
OM1/Circ w flow-limiting disease, Circ not able to be wired,
BMSx2 to OM1 takeoff, complicated by circ jailing, course
further c/b femoral pseudoaneurysm at and hypotension during
post-cath HD.  Night prior to transfer, patient with continued
slow bleeding from cath site (changing dressing q30-60minutes),
abciximad held (given psuedoaneurysm).  Next AM patient
developed hypotension to 60s/30s while at HD, as well as
dizziness and mental status changes that did not initially
resolve with fluid bolus; HD stopped, patient given 2 units of
pRBCs w resolution of pressures to 100s
.
At time of initial exam in HD, patient w HR 60s, SBP 108,
mentating well and without complaint of chest pain, shortness of
breath, dizziness, EKG with ST depressions in II,III,avF similar
to prior EKG.  Patient transferred to CCU for further
management.

MRSA Screen [**12-25**]: Negative
MRSA Screen [**12-27**]: Negative
.
IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
C.CATH [**12-22**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-RI.
3. Occluded SVG-OM.
4. Normal systemic arterial blood pressure.
5. Successful PCI of OM1 with two overlapping BMS.
6. Unsuccessful attempt to revascularize AV groove LCx.
7. Hemodialysis post-procedure.
8. Ongoing optimal medical therapy for CAD and CHF.
9. Repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for improvement in LVEF
after
revascularizing the OM1. If not, consider repeat viability study
(Dobutamine echo) and re-assess the need to open the LCx.
.
Extremity U/S [**12-23**]:
IMPRESSION: 1.2 x 1.1 cm right groin pseudoaneurysm.
.
TTE [**12-25**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF
30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-9**],
left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now regional and global
systolic function is preserved. Left ventricular cavity size is
now normal.
.
C.CATH [**12-25**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Jailed AV groove Lcx with delayed flow.
3. Patent OM bare metal stents.
4. Unsuccessful attempt at PCI of AV groove Lcx due to inability
to
cross lesion with wire.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**12-27**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing
pleural
effusions have minimally decreased in extent. However,
bilateral, right more than left subtle reticular opacities are
seen on both the frontal and the lateral radiograph. Given the
small overall lung volumes the findings are suggestive of a
fibrotic process. CT could be performed to clarify this
suspicion. Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of acute
pulmonary edema.
Status post CABG.
.
CXR Portable [**12-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure.
2. No residual pneumothorax identified.
