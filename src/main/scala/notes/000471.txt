History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 66M with parkinson's s/p brain implant transferred
from nursing home with malaise, AMS,  fevers.  The pt was at
baseline and not complaining of any problems yesterday from [**6-24**].
 Around 8 PM on [**4-26**], the pt was noted by nsg home staff to be in
bed, lethargic and not responsive to voice, which is different
from his alert/verbal baseline.  There was some question of
seizure activity because he was found with both arms clenched
and rigid in upward position.  Vitals at the time were 97.8, 74
24 120/60 96% on 2 L.  When EMS arrived he was noted to be
unresponsive, with eyes open but pupils glossy but reactive.  RR
was 22, 99% on RA.  He was transferred to [**Hospital3 2783**]
where vitals were 100.7 160/80 79 20 95% and he was noted to be
weak and not responding to verbal stimuli initially, later was
responding to son who reported he was at baseline.  He was given
zosyn 3.375 mg, 2 mg ceftriaxone.  Pt was placed on BiPAP as
family was considering de-escalating goals of care from full
code.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 118/49 71 16 100%.
ABG showed 7.25 pCO2 94 pO2 198 HCO3 43.  UA showed sm
leukocytes, mod blood.  Pt arrived here with somewhat improved
abg, but worsening resp rate and didn't seem to be protecting
airway. Discussions with family did not lead to reversal of full
code and so patient was intubated.  Pt was started on
vanc/zosyn/ceftriaxone/cefepime at meningitis dosing, started on
a propofol drip.  Blood and urine cultures were sent, LP was
attempted but was unsucessful.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T100 66 140/62.  He is
intubated and sedated.

Imaging:
CXR [**4-27**]:
FINDINGS: A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained
portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.
Part of the lung fields are obscured by bilateral pacemakers.
The endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm above the carina. Opacity at
the left lung base may represent a small effusion and
atelectasis or infection. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to
evaluate due to the left lung opacity. The upper lung zones are
clear. No large pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube follows the
expected course, although the tip is not visualized, possibly in
the proximal duodenum.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lung opacity may represent small left
pleural effusion and atelectasis or infection.

CT Head [**4-27**]:
CT HEAD: Study is limited by intracranial leads and patient
motion. There is no large acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or
large territorial infarct obvious in the parts of brain where
well seen. Prominent ventricles and sulci are compatible with
global age-related volume loss. Basal cisterns are patent. There
is no shift of midline structures. No acute osseous abnormality
is identified. Fluid in the ethmoid air cells and and nasal
cavities may be related to intubation.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient motion and streak
artifact from
intracranial leads. No acute intracranial large hemorrhage or
mass effect
identified. Consider repeat study when the pt. is co-operative.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2160-4-28**] 3:57
AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube is in correct position and unchanged. The
bilateral pectoral pacemakers are also unchanged. Unchanged
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with cranially displaced
stomach. No pneumothorax. No other acute changes in the lung
parenchyma. The aspect of the cardiac silhouette is constant.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2160-4-27**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow,
disorganized
background mostly in the theta and delta frequency ranges. This
finding
suggests the prese
