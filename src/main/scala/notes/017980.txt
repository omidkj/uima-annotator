Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2176-7-29**] emergent subtotal colectomy, small bowel resection, tube
thoracostomy

History of Present Illness:
44M with h/o CLL on rituxan tx presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital in
NH on [**2176-7-8**] with abdominal pain.  Free air was noted on upright
CXR.  Patient went emergently to the OR, where a perforated
anterior gastric ulcer was discovered and contained with [**Location (un) **]
patch.  On [**7-18**], he returned to the OR for fascial dehiscence,
and was found to be obstructed.  He underwent LOA with placement
of retention sutures.  On [**7-19**], his total bilirubin began to
rise, reaching a max of 8.6 on [**7-23**].  A CT thorax did not reveal
any abdominal pathology.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
suspicion of cholangitis and possible ERCP.  On admission, he
was on TPN and Zosyn (day 15).

CT abd/pelvis ([**2176-7-24**]): 1.  Distal small bowel obstruction.  2.
 Large amount of ascites, some of which is loculated, and
minimal free  intraperitoneal air.  These findings may be
related to previous laparotomy.  3.  Cholelithiasis.  4.
Innumerable enlarged lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen and
pelvis, compatible with known diagnosis of CLL.  5.  Diffuse
anasarca.

RUQ U/S ([**2176-7-24**]): Limited evaluation of gallbladder due to
multiple air containing stones as viewed on CT causing diffuse
posterior shadowing.  No definite evidence of air within the
wall itself.

Gallbladder scan ([**2176-7-25**]): The above findings are consistent
with severe liver dysfunction without evidence of common bile
duct obstruction. Please note the gallbladder and cystic duct
cannot be adequately assessed in the setting of liver
dysfunction.

MRCP ([**2176-7-26**]): Intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts appear
unremarkable.  There is no evidence of choledocholithiasis. 2.
Gastric wall thickening and hyperenhancement likely representing
post-operative changes and possible ongoing ulcer disease. 3.
Pleural effusion and moderate ascites.

UGI/SBFT ([**2176-7-28**]):  No evidence of extraluminal extravasation
of contrast on this study limited by patient intolerance of
prone positioning. 2.  Free passage of contrast through the
stomach into the duodenum. 3.  Thickened folds of the gastric
body and limited gastric distensibility.

RUE U/S ([**2176-7-28**]): 1.  Nonocclusive thrombus present within the
right basilic vein. 2.  Right internal jugular vein not directly
identified. Followup study may be performed is there is clinical
concern for venous occlusion. 3.  Cervical lymphadenopathy.

Pathology ([**2176-7-29**]):
I.  Ileocolectomy (A-L): 1.  Pseudomembranous colitis, diffuse,
extending to distal resection margins. 2.  Malignant lymphoma
involving ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes.  The case will be
reviewed by hematopathology with their report in an addendum. 3.
 Organizing peritoneal hemorrhage.
II.  Left colon (M-R): 1.  Diffuse pseudomembrane colitis,
extending to both margins. 2.  Hemorrhage and fibrotic serosa
and mesocolic fat. 3.  No tumor.
III.  Sigmoid colon (S-U): 1.  Mild pseudomembranous colitis,
extending to the margins. 2.  Fibrosis and hemorrhage of serosa
and mesocolic fat. 3.  No tumor.
IV.  Small intestine, partial resection (V-Y): 1.  Unremarkable
small intestinal mucosa. 2.  Hemorrhage and fibrosis of
peritoneum. 3.  No tumor.

CT head ([**2176-7-29**]): 1.  No intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
or abnormal enhancement. 2.  Mucosal thickening in multiple
paranasal sinuses with features as described above.

CT chest/abd/pelvis ([**2176-7-29**]); 1.  Bilateral airspace
consolidation with moderate pleural effusion and atelectasis,
suggestive of ARDS.  2.  Massive mediastinal, hilar, axillary,
mesenteric, and retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy due to chronic leukemia.  3.  Two loculated
fluid collections versus abscesses, one at the left flank and
one anterior to the rectum, which may be communicating.  4.
Marked wall thickening throughout the colon, suggestive of
pancolitis.  Edema in the peritoneal fat and small amount of
ascites. 5.  Gallstones.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**].  He
was made NPO with IVF.  A fever (Tmax 101.4) work-up was
initiated.  A CXR demonstrated a LLL infiltrate.  All urine and
blood cultures drawn throughout this hospital stay were
ultimately negative.  Surgery was consulted.  An NGT was placed
with immediate bilious output and symptomatic relief.  Patient
was transferred to SICU on HD 2.  He continued to be febrile
(Tmax 101.2) and tachycardic.  A CT demonstrated distal SBO and
cholelithiasis.  He was not a candidate for ERCP given his
recently laparotomies x 2 and perforated ulcer repair.  Flagyl
was added.  On HD 3, he continued tachycardic, but his
temperature decreased slightly; Tmax was 100.4.  HIDA and MRCP
were performed without evidence for CBD obstruction.  TPN was
started.  On HD 4, Tmax was 101.7 and he remained tachycardic.
Diuresis was begun with IV Lasix.  On HD 5, Tmax was 101.5.  He
was still tachycardic.  All antibiotics were d/c'd and the
patient was transferred to the floor.  On HD 6, Tmax decreased
to 100, but he was still tachycardic.  He was transferred back
to the SICU for progressive dyspnea (RR in mid 30s) and labored
breathing, ABG 7.53/34/50/29/5.  Lasix gtt was started.  He
failed to improve clinically despite non-rebreather FM and
BiPAP; he was later intubated.  An UGI with SBFT failed to
demonstrate a leak.  His NGT was d/c'd.  On HD 7, he continued
to be febrile and tachycardic.  He required increasing amounts
of pressors to maintain his BP.  Lasix w
