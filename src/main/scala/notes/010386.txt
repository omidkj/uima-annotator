PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is
significant posterior mitral annular calcification.Torn mitral
chordae are present involving the P2 scallop. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5209**] performed and interpreted pre-bypass study.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: The patient is atrially paced. There is mild global
hypokinesis of the right ventricular free wall. The left
ventricle displays low normal systolic function with an ejection
fraction of about 50 to 55%. There is a mitral annuloplasty ring
in situ. It appears well seated. There is mild, centrally
directed mitral regurgitation. The peak gradient across the
mitral valve is 10 mmHg with a cardiac output of 3.5
liters/minute. The thoracic aorta appears intact after
decannulation. No other significant changes from the pre-bypass
study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
for mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass graft surgery
on [**4-4**].  See operative report for further details.  He received
cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to
the intensive care unit for post operative management.  In the
first twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complication.
On post operative day one he was transfused for anemia and
weaned off neosynephrine.  He continued to improve and was
started on betablockers and diuretics.  That afternoon he was
transferred to the floor to begin increasing his activity level.
 Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol. He was
gently diuresed toward his preop weight. Continued to make good
progress and was cleared for discharge to home on POD # 4. All
f/u appts were advised.He should continue to monitor his diet
for good conrol of DM and have glucose checked at PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
