Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2196-3-31**]- 1. Coronary artery bypass graft x2; left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein graft to diagonal artery.2. Endoscopic harvesting
of the long saphenous vein.3. Complex mitral valve repair with
[**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex suture and size 28 [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty ring.

History of Present Illness:
As you recall, he is a 62-year-old gentleman with known mitral
regurgitation.  Approximately one year ago, he required
hospitalization for an acute episode of congestive heart failure
secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.  Since that time, he
has been doing relatively well on medical therapy.  However,
recently, he admits to worsening shortness of breath on
exertion.  He denies chest pain or orthopnea as well as lower
extremity edema.  However, his shortness of breath does limit
his routine ADLs at this time. His most recent echocardiogram is
from [**2196-1-21**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60-65%
with 4+ mitral regurgitation.  There was of note a small
vegetation on the mitral valve.  The aortic valve was normal.
There was 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and his right-sided heart
pressures were elevated.  His PASP was estimated at 38 mmHg.
Given that his serial echocardiograms have shown worsening MR
and increasing PA pressures, he was referred to me for cardiac
surgical evaluation.


Past Medical History:
mitral regurgitation, history of acute congestive heart failure,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction in [**2195-2-20**], and history of pneumonia
in [**2195-2-20**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia.


Social History:
Lives at home w/ his wife.  [**Name (NI) 1403**] in retail.  Denies tobacco
ever, no drug use. Currently drinks 1 beer/night but does have
history of ETOH abuse.


Family History:
Denies early heart disease.


Physical Exam:
Physical examination in my office today revealed a pulse of 58,
respirations of 14, and blood pressure of 158/79, saturation 97%
on room air.  In general, he was a well-developed and
well-nourished male in no acute distress.  His skin was
unremarkable. Oropharynx was benign.  His teeth were in poor
repair.  Neck was supple with full range of motion.  There was
no JVD.  Lungs were clear to  auscultation bilaterally.  Heart
had a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with a III/VI
systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.
Abdomen was benign. Extremities were warm and well perfused
without edema.  He had no varicosities of the greater saphenous
vein.  Neurologically, he was alert and oriented x3.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  He had 5 out 5
strength and no focal deficits were appreciated.  He had 2+
distal pulses and there was a question of a right-sided carotid
bruit.


Pertinent Results:
[**2196-4-1**] ECHOPRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%), although the LVEF may be
overestimated in the face of severe MR. There is moderate
symmetric LVH. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is prolapse of the anterior mitral leaflet and a
chordal remnant is visible in the left atrium during systole.,
and it appears to be the A3 segment. There is no pericardial
effusion. POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced and on an
infusion of phenylephrine. Biventricular function is preserved.
The aorta is intact. The Swan Ganz catheter is in the proximal
right PA. The mitral valve has been repaired and an annuloplasty
ring placed. No chordal remnant is visible , although a long
suture is visible along the sewing ring near the anterior
portion of the left atrium. There is no MR and no paravalvular
leak. No mitral stenosis is evident. The remainder of the
examination is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 48828**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-3-31**] for elective
surgical management of his mitral regurgitation and coronary
artery disease. He was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and a complex mitral
valve repair. Please see operative note for surgical details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. Beta blockade was
initially withheld for transient complete heart block. Pacing
wires were kept in and his rhythm was observed. Over several
days, his heart rate and rhythm improved. Low dose beta blockade
was slowly introduced, and no further heart block was noted.
Given NSTEMI and postoperative hypertension, ACE inhibitor was
resumed. Also received several units of packed red blood cells
for a postoperative anemia. Also started on a 3 day course of
Ciprofloxacin for a positive urinalysis. His ICU course was
otherwise uneventful and he transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day two. Beta blockade was slowly advanced and
anti-hypertensives were titrated accordingly. Given persistent
hypertension, he was eventually started on Clonidine patch. He
remained in a normal sinus rhythm and no further heart block was
noted on telemetry. Given prior history of ETOH, he was started
on multivitamins and anxiolytics. The remainder of his hospital
course was uneventful and he was discharged to home on
postoperative day five.
