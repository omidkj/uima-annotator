Pyelonephritis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This 26 year old female with no known past medical history
presents with 1 week history of left flank [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain as well as
n&v. She described vomit as food content, no blood or bile was
noted. She has not had bowel movement for the past week but does
not feel constipated. She admits to dysuria symptoms and has
been having fevers since saturday. Patient also noted neck
stiffness with headache but denies any photophobia. On arrival
to the ER patient had fever to 103. She was pan cultured and
given iv ceftriaxone and po levofloxacin. Her urine was -ve for
UTI but CT abdomen demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped/rounded
areas of hypo-attenuation within a  mildly enlarged left kidney
consistent with pyelonephritis/lobar nephronia. Patient also
underwent LP which was negative for meningitis. She was admitted
for management of her pyelonephritis as well as for intolerance
of po intake

ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling  pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion  are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST: 1) Bilateral lower lobe predominant dependent areas of
consolidation accompanied by ground glass attenuation and small
centrilobular opacities. Constellation of findings is most
consistent with an aspiration pneumonia. Differential diagnosis
includes dependent distribution of hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
2) Small dependent bilateral pleural effusions.

CT ABD: IMPRESSION: Multiple rounded or slightly wedge-shaped
areas of mixed hypoattenuation within a slightly enlarged left
kidney, in this context, strongly suggestive of acute focal
bacteria nephritis (old term "acute lobar nephronia"). These
lesions may represent an early stage of in situ abscess
formation, and should be correlated with clinical and laboratory
data. Acute renal infarction would be another, more distant
consideration


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt placed on IV ciprofloxacin. After arrival on the floor,
patient became markedly ill, with fevers to 105.5, severe
vomitting and hypoxia to the 80's. Although maintaining her
blood pressure, she was very tachycardic, in moderate-severe
distress. Due to her hypoxia a chest x-ray was obtained which
was consistent with flash pulmonary edema. Given the suspicion
of sepsis, this was concerning for ARDS or interstitial
pneumonia from sepsis. A critical care consult was obtained, and
the patient was emergently moved to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Diuresis was
performed with some improvement. Echocardiogram done the
following morning showed normal cardiac function. A repeat chest
x-ray showed pulmonary effusions, so a non-contrast high-res CT
was obtained to evaluate the lungs, which demonstrated a
superimposed bilateral severe aspiration pneumonia. Her coverage
was broadened to zosyn. Urology consultation was obtained to
investigate the CT findings in the kidney. On review of imaging
there is some suspicion by GU that there may have been a stone
signified by a filling defect on the original CT, likely passed.
Her clinical status improved with incentive spirometry and
antibiotics. She was converted to levaquin/flagyl with continued
improvement. Pt to follow up with GU in 4 months for urogram and
pyelogram.
