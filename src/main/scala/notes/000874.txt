Physical Exam:
Admission:
heart rate of 58 which is regular.
Respiratory rate is 20.  Blood pressure is 140/70.  Height is
5'2".  Weight is 131 pounds.

HEENT, normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Oropharynx is within normal limits.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally except for some mild
crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiac examination shows the pulse shows an irregular rhythm
with a IV/VI systolic murmur heard best at the left parasternal
border and left apex which radiates to left axilla.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Bowel
sounds are present.  There is no costovertebral angle
tenderness.
Extremities are warm and well perfused.  There is
1+ edema.  There are no varicosities.  Pulses are 2+


Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE
[**2192-7-6**]
PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
focal severe hypokinesis of the mid and apical free wall. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened. There is
prolapse of the prosthetic mitral valve leaflets. The gradients
are higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. There is
mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results in the operating
room at the time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is receiving milrinone and epinephrine
by infusion. The patient is AV paced. The right ventricular free
wall shows some mild improvement of the mid and apical segments
but there is still moderate hypokinesis. The left ventricle
dispalys somewhat improved systolic function with an ejection
fraction of about 55%. There is a bioprosthesis in the mitral
position. It appears well seated. There is occassional trace
valvular mitral regurgitation. No perivalvualr regurgitation is
seen. Leaflet motion appears normal. The thoracic aorta appears
intact status post decannulation. No other significant changes
from the pre-bypass study.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2192-7-16**] 1:58 PM
Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: Patient is status post
CABG and
median sternotomy. A right upper extremity PICC is again seen
coiled in the mid SVC, with tip terminating likely in the upper
SVC. This appears unchanged since [**2192-7-9**].
Small right greater than left pleural effusions remain, slightly
decreased on the right. There is adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**7-6**] he went to the Operating Room where redo sternotomy and
redo mitral valve replacement were performed.  He required
reexploration for bleeding in the immediate post-op course, then
remained stable.  Within 24 hours he woke neurologically intact
was extubated and weaned from all vasoactive infusions. All
tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol. He remained in the ICU for close monitoring and was
ultimately transferred to the floor on POD #6. Once on the
stepdown floor he began to increase his activity level. He was
treated with amiodarone/coumadin for recurrent atrial
fibrillation. Speech and swallow team evaluated him for possible
aspiration risk with weak mastication. Diet recommendations made
by team.  He was cleared for a regular diet.  He took several
days to diurese  adequately and to wean from oxygen.  He was
aggressively diuresed for a moderate right sided pleural
effusion and general volume overload.  The patient was
re-started on his home dose of sotalol.   He remained in SR with
1st degree AV block for the remainder of the hospital course.

By the time of discharge on POD 11 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow his
INR and adjust the Coumadin dose accordingly.
