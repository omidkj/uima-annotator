Physical Exam:
96.0 115 113/82 97%2L

crackles

SKIN: No lesions


Pertinent Results:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
severely depressed left ventricular function. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta
.
.
CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION:  No hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a focus of low density
and mild swelling in the parasagittal left posterior frontal
lobe. This suggests a
subacute infarction in this area.
.
.
CXR:
Development of hazy density at the right lung base which may
represent accumulating pleural fluid.  A lateral or lateral
decubitus view may be helpful for further evaluation.
.
.
LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left lower
extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical ICU for management of
decompensated congestive heart failure. A foley catheter was
placed and he was given IV lasix. He diuresed well, but did
require high doses 120mg IV bid. His dyspnea resolved wtih
diuresis and control of his heart rate. Heart rate control was
acheived initally with a Diltizem drip and then transitioned to
PO diltizem. Due to borderline blood pressures of approx 100
systolic, he was also loaded with Digoxin as he took this as an
outpatient and he was continued on Digoxin daily. He was started
on a heparin Drip as a bridge to coumadin. An echocardiogram was
performed which was consistent with both systolic and diastolic
heart failure, please see attached report for details. The
patient was noted to have right sided weakness which he says has
been present for months. a CT scan was positive for a subacute
infarct in the parasagittal left posterior frontal lobe. An
MRI/MRA was ordered to follow this up, which showed multiple
infarcts in the left posterior frontal lobe, biparietal lobes.
A neurology consult was obtained and they are recommending
anticoagulation with heparin, as a bridge to coumadin (goal INR
[**3-2**]), autoregulation of his blood pressure (keeping it below SBP
180), normoglycemia (HbA1c <7), and a low dose statin.  They are
also recommending a carotid ultrasound.  The patient requested
to be transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] to be managed by his
primary cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 15174**] - [**Location (un) 20756**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
1. Cardioembolic left frontal lobe stroke.
2. Acute biventricular systolic heart failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II.
5. 1/4 bottles coagulase negative staphycoccus aureus.
6. Medication non-compliance.


Discharge Condition:

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with Decompensated Heart Failure and
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. You were
diuresed and your heart rate was controlled.  You were
transfered to the medical floor and then transfered to [**Location 28709**] per your request.
.
It is recommended that you continue care with your cardiologist
at [**Hospital6 27369**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please inform him that the
echocardgiogram performed while you were here was concerning for
the development of a restrictive cardiomyopathy and possibly
infiltrative disease.
.
You reported that you have had weakness on your right side for
some time after stopping you blood thinner (coumadin). A head CT
showed a subacute infarction (a stroke).  We followed this study
up with an MRI which confirmed the stroke.

Followup Instructions:
Please attend follow up appointments as directed by your
Cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
