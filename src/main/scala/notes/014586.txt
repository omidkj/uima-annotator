Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, black stools

Upper endoscopy [**2107-1-31**], [**2107-2-17**]
Hemodialysis
Tunneled hemodialysis line

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 y/o F DM, CAD s/p NSTEMI, NASH cirrhosis who had
melena x1 month with abdominal pain and fatigue. She came to the
ED to be evaluated for fatigue. On initial presentation, she had
BP down to 89/50, not responsive to fluids. Additionally had
hyperkalemia. Liver was concerned about HRS so initiated
treatment with midodrine and octreotide with albumin. Renal was
consulted as well. She was found to have a decreased Hct to 22
from baseline of 26 to 27.

Of note patient had recent admission [**Date range (3) 84220**] for
shortness of breath found to have NSTEMI. Cath [**2106-12-30**]
demonstrated single vessel disease - no intervention. Patient
was actively diuresed. For anemia work-up patient had
colonoscopy and EGD which demonstrated esophageal varices and
gastritis. CTA to rule out PE demonstrated nodular liver,
splenomegaly and ascites. Patient is now follewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**]
who felt liver disease is secondary to NASH. Patient was
planning to have banding of esophageal varices one week prior
which was delayed.

Given her Hct drop and abnormal labs as well as hypotension to
the 60s requiring pressors she was admitted to the MICU for
further work up. In the MICU, she received 3 units prbcs,
octreotide gtt, ctx for sbp ppx, and her Aspirin, Nadolol,
Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone were held. She was treated with
albumin, midodrine, octreotide for presumed HRS as well. The
octreotide gtt was discontinued as banding was performed (4
cords of grade 3 varices with stigmata of recent bleeding, no
overt bleeding; banded x 3). No blood in esophagus, stomach,
duodenum. A diagnostic paracentesis was performed without SBP.
Renal initially recommended running patient positive 1-2L. She
required restarting of her neo for persistent hypotension. ECHO
was performed that showed volume overload with mild depressed
systolic function (likely 50%) however it was a poor study. On
[**2-3**], a temporary HD access was placed and patient was placed on
CVVH given volume overload and pressor dependence. She
subsequently had a V/Q scan which was intermediate prob, but
given concerns for massive GI bleed from varices on
anticoagulation, this was not initiated. Of note, she required
BiPAP for several days for respiratory distress given volume
overload. She was initiated on HD on [**2-8**] without complication.


On review of prior records, she was found to have a new pelvic
mass with elevated CA 125 to 400 concerning for ovarian
malignancy (ovaries could not be visualized on prior US).
Outpatient MRI has not yet been completed.

Currently, the patient is breathing well on room air and feels
well. She continues to be weak from her hospital stay. She
reports occasional coughing with phlegm productive which is not
bothersome to her. No BM today despite lactulose. She denies
chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, fevers, chills or myalgias or
other symptoms.

Past Medical History:
After 5 years w/o medical care she presented in [**Month (only) 404**] with new
AFib, NSTEMI, new cirrhosis, elevated CA 125 (400),
nonvisualized ovaries on CT or US, 2.5 cm hypoechoic pelvic mass
c/w fibroid vs ovarian pathology. Was admitted [**Date range (3) 84220**],
cath [**2106-12-30**] demonstrated single vessel disease - no
intervention. Patient was actively diuresed. For anemia work-up
patient had colonoscopy and EGD which demonstrated esophageal
varices and gastritis. CTA to rule out PE demonstrated nodular
liver, splenomegaly and ascites. Was to have outpatient pelvic
MRI to characterize uterine mass. Other studies showed
significant cirrhotic stigmata (varices, splenomegaly, ascites),
and her breathing improved with aggressive diuresis.

Patient is now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] who felt liver disease is
secondary to NASH. Patient was planning to have banding of
esophageal varices one week prior to this admission but this was
delayed due to the snow.
