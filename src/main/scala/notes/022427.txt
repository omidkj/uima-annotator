ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
.
Blood culture x 4 - no growth to date
Urine culture - no growth
.
Foot x-ray ([**5-10**]): Status post second, fourth and fifth
hammertoe surgery, with expected post- surgical soft tissue
swelling. No evidence of soft tissue air or definitive finding
of osteomyelitis.
.
Chest x-ray ([**5-11**]): There are low lung volumes.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Aside from
atelectasis in the left base, the lungs are clear. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
.
Chest x-ray ([**5-11**]): As compared to the previous radiograph,
there are unchanged bilaterally low lung volumes. As a
consequence, the cardiac silhouette is borderline in size. Due
to motion artifact, the morphology of the lung parenchyma cannot
be assessed. There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions.
.
Dopplers of right foot ([**5-13**]): not yet read.  Podiatry should
follow this up on her outpatient appointment

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo F with IDDM, morbid obesity, s/p arthroplasties of 3
hammertoes on right foot on [**2122-5-7**], admitted to floor with
fevers/chills and transferred to MICU with resp
distress/anaphylaxis after receiving vanco.
.
#) Anaphylaxis to vancomycin: This was likely anaphylaxis to
Vancomycin with flushing, rash, rigors/fever, change in mental
status and resp distress.  This is unlikely red man's syndrome
as per discussion with floor resident and RN, pt was clearly in
resp distress prior to first dose of epi and vanco was given
slowly (over 2 hours, pt received <1/2 dose).  Pt received epi
IM 0.3 x 2, solumedrol 150 x1, H2 blocker, and benadryl.  Her
respiratory quickly recovered and she had no further issues off
of the vancomycin.
.
#) Fevers: Likely source is recent surgical site, and wound cx
is growing MSSA but resistant to clindamycin.  WBC has increased
in setting of receiving solumedrol. The patient was successfully
switched to bactrim, to which to MSSA is sensitive.  She had no
further fevers.  Podiatry would like her to continue on the
Bactrim for a total of 7 days.
.
#) Leukocytosis:  Likely due to both her wound infection and
solumedrol 150 mg.  Resolved with a WBC of 9 on day of
discharge.
.
#) S/p arthroplasty on R foot, MSSA wound infection: See above,
continue Bactrim.  Outpatient podiatry follow-up.  [**Date Range 269**] for daily
dressing changes.
.
#) IDDM:  Her blood sugars have been high, likely because of
infection and the one dose of solumedrol.  Pt was initially
continued on Lantus 40 units twice daily with regular insulin
sliding scale while in house.  However, pt's glucose were in the
400's in the MICU, and she was started on an insulin gtt. Pt is
a pt at [**Last Name (un) **]. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended to increase
lantus to 45mg [**Hospital1 **] and continue insulin drip ove
