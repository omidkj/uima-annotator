History of Present Illness:
65 year old female with past medical history of abdominal aortic
aneurysm status post endovascular repair, hypertension,
cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, small cell lung
cancer and myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] who presented to the ER today with
weakness and hypoxia. Of note, she presented to her neurologist
complaining of weakness on [**8-6**] and he was concerned for steroid
myopathy. He decreased her dose of prednisone to 40mg daily,
started Imuran and stopped cellcept. Patient has felt weak for
the past few weeks with generalized exhaustion without any known
causative events. Patient has fallen a few times this week with
one fall sustaining head impact last night. No loss of
consciousness. Over the past couple of days, patient has also
had some dysuria as well as vomiting without nausea, fever, or
chills.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.2 P 92 BP 150/97 R 22 O2 sats
of 88% on RA. CXR and CT head were negative for acute processes.
Patient was given Ceftriaxone 1gram for a positive urinalysis
and Mestinon 60mg for her myasthenia. Neurology was consulted
and felt this was unlikely consistent a myasthenia crisis but
recommended following NIFs. Patient was found to have elevated
lactate at 4 and transferred to the ICU for respiratory
monitoring after gentle hydration.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient was denying chest pain, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, joint pain. She complains of
generalized exhaustion. No sick contacts.
.

[**8-16**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation. Incomplete right bundle-branch
block. Extensive ST-T wave changes may b e due to myocardial
infarction. Also, consider digitalis effect.

[**8-16**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process. Stable appearance of
enlargement
of the main pulmonary arteries compatible with pulmonary
hypertension.

[**8-16**] CT Head: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.

2. Moderate chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

[**8-16**] Abdominal films: 1. Gastric distention. No evidence of small
bowel dilatation or free air.
2. Stool and air are seen throughout the colon.

[**8-19**] CT chest: 1. Left upper lobe nodular density with adjacent
bronchial dilatation is most likely infectious or inflammatory
in etiology. 2. Persistent right infrahilar nodular density with
adjacent infrahilar lymphadenopathy for which FDG PET is
recommended to exclude neoplasm. Because PET may be false
positive in the setting of infection, consider postponing the
PET until after antibiotic treatment for the potentially
infectious lesion in the left apex to avoid a false positive
finding in this location. 3. New Scleotic lesion of the T8.
Although compression fracture is most likely, pathological
fracture can not be excluded. This may also be assessed at the
time of PET.

[**2122-8-25**] ECHO: Dilated right ventricle with normal systolic
function. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved systolic function. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension with signs of RV volume
overload.


Brief Hospital Course:
Weakness: Likely due to myasthenia crisis or hypercalcemia.
Patient's home dose of pyridostigmine and prednisone 40mg were
continued and azathioprine  started. Patient received five
plasmapheresis sessions. At discharge, patient was saturating in
the high 90s on room air and denied shortness of breath at rest.
Negative Intrathoracic Force ranged from 30-50 and vital
capactities were between 0.8-1.3L.
.
Hypercalcemia: Calcium on admission was 15.9 but was down around
8 after receiving calcitonin and bisphophonate. Parathyroid
hormone, parathyroid related hormone, and vitamin D levels were
normal. Given history of small cell cancer, there is a concern
for an osteolytic process secondary to metastasis. Chest CT
showed lesion in T8. Would recommend PET imaging for further
evaluation.
.
Hypertension: Patient's anti-hypertensive regimen was altered
during admission. Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued due to
hypercalcemia and hydralazine discontinued due to peripheral
edema. Patient was switched from 25mg metoprolol three times
daily to atenolol 100mg daily and lisinopril 40mg po twice
daily.
.
Atrial fibrillation: Coumadin was held during plasmapheresis.
Heparin drip was started. Coumadin was restarted on [**2122-8-26**]
after completion of plasmapharesis. INR at discharge was 1.1.
Digoxin was held because of
