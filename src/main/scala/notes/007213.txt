Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5301**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 83 yo female w/ h/o bilateral pe's, pneumonia,
pulmonary hypertension and emphysema who presents with dyspnea.
The patient has chronic dyspnea that has steadily worsened such
that she has been breathing very heavy in the last 3 days. She
has no cp, cough, pleuritic pain, or fevers with dyspnea and
dyspnea is worse with activity. She only notes she may have had
chills lately. With this she has felt very weak and tired
lately, and the night prior to admission she felt as if she was
going to collapse. Patient did not lose consciousness, and may
have had some palpitations prior to this episode. In addition to
the above, the patient has had decreased po intake, nausea x 1
week (and 2 episodes of non-bloody vomitius), associated with po
intake. She denies abd pain, dysuria, hematuria, diarrhea
(although chronically she stools ~ 3x/day). She has had no sick
contacts to her knowledge either. Per the family, it seems as if
the patient has many issues, that have recently escalated and
they are most concerned with her recent fatigue and inablility
to do activities given her sob.
.
In ed pt. was hypoxic and placed on nrb. She was given 40 iv
lasix and 60 prednisone x 1. In ED she underwent CTA Chest,
which ruled out PE. CT Abdomen showed gallbladder wall
thickening, confirmed by RUQ US. Surgery was consulted to
consider HIDA scan.

results:

IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of PE.
2) Persistent multifocal ground glass opacities with interval
resolution of peribronchiolar patchy opacities and multifocal
nodular opacities seen on the prior CT of [**2152-12-16**],
suggesting a resolving infectious process.
3) Significant atherosclerotic burden of the aorta and its major
tributaries,
4) Thickened gallbladder wall, with hyperenhancing gallbladder
mucosa.

likely consistent with resolving pneumonia

[**2-6**] US ruq:
CONCLUSION: Edematous gallbladder wall without significant
luminal distention and without gallstones. There was no focal
tenderness directly over the gallbladder.

The lack of a more distended gallbladder lumen plus the
prominent hepatic veins, and the appearance of the lungs on
today's CTA study suggests the gallbladder edema may be due to
third spacing of fluid secondary to congestive heart failure.
Clinical correlation is recommended, but in nearly all cases of
acute cholecystitis, the lumen is much more distended than we
see in this patient. If necessary, this could be further
evaluated with a radionuclide biliary scan.
.
ct head [**2-11**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
significant change from prior study. MRI with diffusion-weighted
images is more sensitive in the evaluation for acute
ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail.

echo [**2153-2-12**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline depressed right
ventricular function (not full visualized). [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: The patient presented with acute on chronic dyspnea
and given her history of multiple pneumonias, chills and per
patient's family low temperatures the concern was for a
recurrent pneumonia. Another concern originally was for COPD
exacerbation.  The patient was treated with azithromycin and
ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia and prednisone and nebulizers
for COPD exacerbation.  The pulmonary team was consulted and
felt most of this was due to fluid overload so th patient was
diuresed.  The patient improved, but on [**2153-2-10**] she was noted to
be cyanotic off oxygen so placed on 4L and became unresponsive,
with junctional rhythm (AV dissociation ?). A code blue was
called for unresponsiveness and hypoxia (80%). She was intubated
and placed on dopamine drip due to hypotension and sent to CCU.
Her course in the CCU involved being weaned off pressors and her
hypotension resolved. She was extubated on [**2-12**] without any
issues. She was treated with high dose steroids for her
pulmonary status and also treated for presumed aspiration
pneumonia with ceftriaxone and flagyl. She had a CTA that was
negative for PE.  She was transferred back to the floor, and at
that time she was weaned off steroids and completed a 7 day
course of ceftriaxone and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  The
patient improved on the floor and pulmonary felt most of her
symptoms were related to her pulmonary hypertension and some
fluid overload.  She was started on sildenafil and diuresed.
She was doing well at discharge and will continue her inhalers,
sildenafil and will have close follow-up as an outpatient with
pulmonary.
.
2. Nausea: The patient's nausea and abdominal discomfort was
attributed to her enlarged gallbladder.  With diruesis this
improved.  Surgery saw the patient and did not see the need for
a HIDA scan.  Her urine was negative for infection, and with
diuresis she no longer complained of nausea or pain.
