Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening dyspnea on exertion and LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6512**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o CHF (EF=55%), valvular
disease (AS & MR), and Afib admitted overnight with complaints
of worsening dyspnea on exertion and LE edema. Admission note
comments that patient was unable to provide a history. Per ED
notes, caretaker reported pt has had worsening LE swelling over
the last 2 weeks (L>R), decreased activity, and decreased PO
intake. Also reports of increased left breast edema. Report of
patient being on a diuretic, but unsure of name or dose.
Caretaker says for the past several days pt has c/o DOE and
decreased activity. On admission, patient denied recent
F/C/cough, CP/SOB/trauma. EMS notes indicated pt was found with
O2 of 89% on RA, rales on exam. EMS also indicated that she was
A&Ox4, but ED note states had altered mental status. CT head was
performed in the ED which showed no acute bleed.
.
In the ED she received 500cc NS IV. CXR showed CHF, effusions,
and posterior opacity c/w ?pneumonia. ceftriaxone 1g IV x 1 and
azithromycin 500mg IV x 1 given in ED. Bilateral LENI's negative
in the ED.
.
This morning patient found by medicine team to be minimally
reponsive; was opening eyes to command, but not answering all
questions. Low BP (88/palp), normal pulse, RR high 20's, 94% on
4L O2. Also did not make any urine overnight. ABG attempted, but
only able to get VBG (7.18/93/36). MICU called for eval and
transfer.

CXR [**2169-1-16**]
1. Congestive heart failure with moderate effusions.
2. New posterior opacity, on the lateral view, which may relate
to edema, but in the appropriately clinical setting raises
concern for infection.
.
CT HEAD [**2169-1-16**]
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. MRI with
diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in the evaluation
for acute ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail
.
R LE doppler [**2169-1-16**]: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
.
CT head [**2169-1-16**]: no evidence of hemorrhage.
.
ECHO [**2168-12-19**]: elongated LA. mild symmetric LVH w/ normal cavity
size; normal systolic function (LVEF>55%). RV chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened; mild aortic stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2)
Trace aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation. moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2166-7-24**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and
increased mitral regurgitation are now seen. The severity of
aortic stenosis is similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
MICU COURSE:
.
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The etiology for her
respiratory failure was unclear. Differential diagnosis of her
respiratory failure in this patient: CHF, mucous plug.  Echo
shows new right ventricular hypokinesis and EF 60%, this in
conjunction with elevated d-dimer and clinical picture makes PE
more likely.  Patient was empirically anticoagulated.
Hypoventilation due to sedating meds possible, but patient did
not receive narcotics, benzos, or other sedatives since
admission.  Bicarb appears chronically elevated (~28-29) over
the last month. Possibly acute on chronic resp failure;
?neuromuscular or obstructive disease.  After discussion with
the patient, she refused bipap and intubation.  Initially family
requested that patient be full code; however, after patient
refused all intervention, including CPR, intubation, and BiPAP,
family agreed to DNR/DNI status.
.
# ALTERED MS: Patient was reportedly functional at baseline with
intact MS. Only A&Ox2 on this admission.  CT negative for ICH.
Confusion likely secondary to hypercarbia.  Could be also be due
to infection (possible pneumonia). Dig level was normal at 1.7.
She was treated empirically with vanco, ceftriaxone, and azithro
for presumed pneumonia and mastitis
.
# PNEUMONIA: Posterior opacity on CXR. Continued on antibiotics
mentioned above
.
# MASTITIS: Patient had rash on L breast and swelling,
consistent with mastitis.  She was continued on vancomycin for
this issue.
.
# CHF: Patient likely with CHF exacerbation on admission
supported by elevated JVD, rales on lung exam, peripheral edema
reported by ED note. Appeared to be more euvolemic to dry at the
time of MICU admission. Patient received lasix, without urine
output.  Echo showed EF 60%, new right ventricular hypokinesis.
BNP was elevated around [**Numeric Identifier 16351**].
.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr 1.9 on admission, now 2.9.
Oliguric. Increased from 1.4-1.6 prior to admission (though has
been up to 1.9 before). Urine Na<10. Right kidney showed no
hydronephrosis. Left kidney not imaged due to patient not
compliant with exam.  Creatinine continued to trend up during
admission.  Patient did not respond to IVFs.
.
# A FIB: Patient in AFib this admission.  This was monitored and
she was continued on digoxin.  Dig levels were followed closely
given ARF.
.
# ELEVATED TROP: Troponin had been elevated before.  Patient was
not complaining any chest pain.  CKs flat.  This was possibly
elevated [**1-13**] to renal failure or demand from CHF.
.
# DECREASED PLATELETS: plts noted to drop from 200->100 while on
heparin SC during prior admission, plts appropriately increased
off heparin. HIT antibody negative.
.
# H/O HTN: BP currently slightly low; Lopressor held.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI, no Central line, no pressors, no BiPAP
(confirmed with patient and family)
.
# DISPO: Her respiratory and renal functions continued to
decline while in the MICU. After discussion with her family,
patient was made comfort care measures. She expired on [**2169-1-20**].
Family was notified at that time.
