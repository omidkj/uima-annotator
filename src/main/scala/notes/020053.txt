Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2137-10-1**]): The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in
the interval. There is calcification seen in the aorta. There is
cardiomegaly, unchanged. There are prominent interstitial
markings with slight redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature
consistent with mild CHF. There is a left subclavian line whose
tip is in the distal SVC. There is no pneumothorax.

TTE ([**2137-10-2**]): LA mod dil. A small secundum type ASD is seen
with color Doppler with left-to-right flow. There is mod sym LVH
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional LV wall motion is normal. RV chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The AV leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe AS with mild (1+) AI . The
MV leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-30**]+) MR is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pHTN. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe AS/mild AI. Prominent symmetric LVH with
preserved biventricular systolic function. Small secundum type
atrial septal defect. Mild-moderate MR.

Cardiac Cath ([**2137-10-4**]): 1. 2VD. 2. Severe AS. 3. Severe
systemic HTN. 4. Moderate LV diastolic dysfunction. 5. Moderate
pHTN. 6. Preserved CO.

COMMENTS(1): 1. R dom circulation 2. 2VD. 3. LIMA - WNL. 4. LAD
- Diffuse calc: 60% MID; 80% DISTAL; D1 - Diffuse Diseased, up
to 60%. 5. LCX - Small vessel; Diffusely

COMMENTS(2): Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left
sided pressures with a mPCWP of 22 mmHg. Moderate pHTN with a RV
systolic pressure of 47 mmHg was present. Significant AV
gradient was present with a peak to peak gradient of 84 mmHg,
and mean gradient of 68 mmHg. The calculated valve area was 0.58
cm2. Calculated cardiac output and index were preserved at 4.2
l/min and 2.7 l/min/m2, respectively. Sig systemic HTN was
evident.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F H/O NH Low-Grade B-Cell Lymphoma (S/P Rituxan [**2135**]), Chronic
AF, W/O H/O HTN presented to oncologist today for routine visit
- SBP noted at 240; pt now stable w/o symptoms, CEs flat, and
SBP 170.
She was admitted for hypertension.  Cardaic echo revealed
critical aortic stenosis,  subsequent cardiac cath revealed
2vCAD, and critical AS.  She was referred for CABG and AVR.
Remained on medical service.  Taken to OR on [**10-9**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for CABG X 1, Aortic Valve replacement (21mm tissue
valve), and aortic root enlargement.
Post-op she was taken to the cardiac surgery recovery unit.  She
was noted to have a very large right thigh hematoma with large
area of ecchymosis.  Vascular surgery was consulted, no
pseudoaneurysm (by ultrasound), serial hcts were followed.
Pt. was initially slow to wake and when she did, she was noted
to have left arm weakness.  A neurology consult was obtained.
MRI of the brain revealed multiple small areas of infarction.
The neurology service felt that she'd had some small embolic
strokes, with a good prognosis.
She had progressed well from a hemodynamic standpoint, and had
begun ambulation and physical therapy.  She had a swallowing
evaluation due to some concern for dysphagia, but she was found
to have no swallowing deficit, and was then cleared to eat and
drink ad lib.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 48291**] had been urinating well, when a follow-up CT scan
(to assess her groin hematoma) revealed a very distended
bladder.  A foley catheter was re-placed (800 cc obtained), and
a urology consult was obtained.  The foley was again removed,
and her post-void residual (on [**10-21**]) was 500ml.  The foley was
re-placed again, and per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] (urology), she was started
on Flomax.  It is his recommendation that Mrs. [**Known lastname 48291**] be
discharged with the foley in place for 1 week, at which time she
should see him in clinic (or follow-up with an outside
urologist).
