History of Present Illness:
History obtained from patient's family, outside ED/Hospital
records, our ED records, & OMR as the patient is minimally
responsive and not communicative on interview.

The patient has been admitted from and OSH ED from her nursing
home for nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain and leukocytosis for
the past 24 hours. She has become increasingly altered over that
time.

Since [**2147-7-14**] she has been in declining health. At that
time she was living at home and was admitted to an OSH for chest
pain found to be coronary artery disease medically managed
presumedly with anti-platelet therapy. She developed black tarry
stools and was found to have a bleeding ulcer at that time. In
[**2147-10-14**] she had a dyspnea admission ruled anxiety. In
[**2147-12-14**] she was admitted again for vomiting and found to
have a VRE UTI, L sided pneumonia with LLE cellulitis. Per her
daughter, during this admission the patient had an "upper GI
obstruction," likely volvulus warranting surgery. However no
surgery was performed. She was transferred to Country [**Hospital 731**]
Rehab for several hours and returned with an acute MI. She was
transferred to [**Hospital 12017**] Hospital for cath and had bare metal
stent placed in the "front artery." Upon return to rehab she was
again readmitted for Pulmonary edema. This most recent stay
ended [**2148-1-17**] with discharge to [**Hospital 32944**] Rehab.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient was vomiting and
complaining of abdominal pain the night prior to presentation.
The patient is alert and oriented at [**Hospital 5348**] but does become
combative when irritated.

At the OSH ED she was somnolent but arousable and oriented.
There she received Dilaudid & a benzodiazepine with IV Fluids.
She was monitored on telemetry. Concern for Small Bowel
Obstruction warranted Abdominal CT with PO contrast only (no
sufficient IV access). That scan was reviewed by our
radiologists and showed only a ventral hernia and poor
penetration of contrast into her colon, not suggestive of
obstruction or acute abdominal process. She was noted to have a
WBC of 21 with 91% neutrophils, HCT 34.3, Cr 1.1. CK 29 with
CKMB 8.6 which is elevated and tropinin I of 0.12 which is
within the normal range. They treated her with 1g vancomycin for
concern of shunt infection and sent her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. Of note, she has recently been on doxycycline,
vanomycin and levafloxacin for M. Catarrhalis from her sputum,
resistant E coli from urine and also with linezolid for VRE in
the urine (per records from [**Hospital 12017**] Hospital).

In our ED, VS: 96.5 BP 125/79 P 118 RR 14 98% on room air. The
patient received Flagyl/Zosyn for putative abdominal infection.
Surgery was consulted and based on exam and review of the films,
did not feel she had an acute problem nor did she warrant
surgical intervention. Stable ventral hernia, easily reducible
with bowel in hernia. She was admitted to medicine for elevated
WBC count and evaluation of her mental status.

On arrival to the floor the patient is tachycardia and minimally
responsive. She awakes to vigorous stimulation and multiple
sternal rubs. She is unable to give any history or status.


Past Medical History:
Obtained from family and OSH records and OMR:

CT head [**1-20**] AM:
IMPRESSION: Stable position of ventricular shunt with slightly
increased
ventricular size and transependymal edema. No evidence of acute
hemorrhage.

CT head [**1-20**] PM:
IMPRESSION: No short interval change in ventricular caliber. No
new
intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.


Endoscopy [**2148-1-20**]:
Normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Monitor HCT q6hrs
Continue PPI
Additional notes: There was absolutely no blood seen in the
upper GI tract as far as the scope could be passed. Source of
melena likely right sided colonic versus small bowel lesion.

Colonoscopy [**2148-1-24**]
Multiple diverticula were seen in the whole colon.
Melena was seen in the ascending colon, transverse colon,
descending colon and sigmoid colon.
No active bleeding seen from the diverticula.
No large polyps or masses identified; however the presence of
small polyps or lesions cannot be completely excluded due to the
presence of melena.
Consider capsule endoscopy to r/o small bowel source of bleeding
