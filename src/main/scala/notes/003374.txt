Service:  SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
who was transferred from [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital.  He was
admitted to the outside hospital on [**2195-7-7**] with complaints
of right upper quadrant pain and fevers to 102.  He also had
complaints of nausea and vomiting.  A CT scan at the outside
hospital showed the presence of gallstones with a moderately
dilated gallbladder and evidence of pericholecystic fluid.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation and possible surgical
intervention.  At the outside hospital, the patient was
started on intravenous antibiotics for broad spectrum
coverage for cholecystitis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and
management of his cholecystitis.  He was made nothing by
mouth and continued on intravenous Unasyn.  A nasogastric
tube was also placed.

While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, a central venous
line was placed to monitor the patient's fluid status, given
his history of congestive heart failure.  The patient was
also evaluated by the endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography team given his symptoms and elevated
bilirubin and white blood cell count.  The decision was made
to proceed with an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography rather than surgical intervention
with a cholecystectomy, given the patient's multiple medical
problems.

On [**2195-7-9**], the patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography with general anesthesia.  Moderate
diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree, with the
common bile duct measuring 10 mm.  The gallbladder was noted
to be edematous and very abnormal appearing.  Multiple stones
were also seen in the gallbladder.  The intrahepatic ducts
were normal.  A sphincterotomy was also performed with
drainage of purulent bile.  Recommendations were made to
perform a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement under
CT guidance.

On that same day, an 8 French pigtail catheter was inserted
into the gallbladder under CT guidance.  Approximately 100 cc
of dark bile was retrieved and sent for culture.  The culture
eventually grew out Klebsiella organisms which were sensitive
to both Unasyn and levofloxacin.  Following the placement of
the cholecystostomy tube, the patient symptomatically
improved.  He complained of less abdominal pain and nausea
and vomiting.

On hospital day number three, the patient was noted to
convert his cardiac rhythm from normal sinus rhythm to a
rapid atrial fibrillation.  His blood pressures were
initially stable, and an esmolol infusion was started.
Thirty minutes following the initiation of the esmolol
infusion, the patient was found profoundly hypotensive, with
systolic blood pressures in the 60s, and also decreasing
oxygen saturation to 88%.  He was started on Neo-Synephrine
infusion to maintain his blood pressures.  His cardiac rhythm
did convert back to normal sinus rhythm.  He also received
fluid boluses and his requirement for pressors was eventually
obviated.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction with serial cardiac enzymes.

On hospital day number five, the patient was also noted to
have a low hematocrit.  He was transfused with two units of
packed red blood cells, with an appropriate rise in his
hematocrit.  Given his nothing by mouth status, the patient
was also started on total parenteral nutrition for nutrition.
The likely etiology of the patient's decreased hematocrit was
a post-sphincterotomy bleed.  His hematocrit eventually
stabilized, and the patient required no additional blood
transfusions.

On hospital day number seven, the patient was transferred
from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  The
patient was also found to have elevated amylase and lipase
levels.  His lipase eventually reached a level in the 500s.
He was thought to have post-endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis.  The patient was
therefore kept nothing by mouth, and administered total
parenteral nutrition, since he had biochemical evidence of
pancreatitis.

On hospital day number nine, the patient was switched from
intravenous Unasyn to levofloxacin for antibiotic coverage.
His diet was also advanced to a full liquid diet, given his
clinical improvement.  The patient, however, continued to
complain of abdominal pain in his epigastric area.  He was
also noted to have increasing alkaline phosphatase and total
bilirubin levels.  This was concerning for possible
obstruction of his bile ducts.

On [**2195-7-20**], the patient underwent a cholangiogram through his
existing cholecystostomy tube.  He was found to have a single
large and multiple small stones, as well as a patent cystic
and common bile duct.  These findings were consistent with a
nonobstructing distal common bile duct stone.  These new
cholangiogram findings prompted further discussion of a
possible cholecystectomy vs. a repeat endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography for stone removal.

Given the patient's multiple medical problems, a risk factor
assessment was initiated.  He underwent a surface
echocardiogram on [**2195-7-21**] to assess his ejection fraction.
He was noted to have mildly dilated left atrium and mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  The overall left
ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed.  The
aortic valve leaflets were moderately thickened.  Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation was seen.  His estimated ejection
fraction was 50 to 55% on echocardiogram.

On [**2195-7-22**], the patient also underwent a stress MIBI.  During
this examination, he had no anginal symptoms.  His
electrocardiogram was uninterpretable since he had an
existing left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram.  He
was found to have a mild reversible defect of the basilar
portion of the lateral wall and normal wall motion with an
ejection fraction of 46%.

With the patient's worsening alkaline phosphatase and
bilirubin levels, he was switched back to Unasyn for
antibiotic therapy.  A Cardiology consult was also obtained
for risk
