DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right middle lobe bronchial carcinoid.
2.  Loculated left pleural effusion with entrapped left lower
and left upper lobes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a delightful 86
year-old gentleman who was admitted to the hospital for
endobronchial ablation of his right middle lobe carcinoid as
well as left sided decortication.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted to the hospital and
underwent a left thoracoscopy and mini left thoracotomy with
total decortication of the left lung.  He had along and
difficult course due to prolonged air leaks and failure of
the lung to immediately reexpand.  Ultimately the lung
reexpanded and the air leak stopped and we were able to pull
his chest tubes and send him home.  Due to the difficulties
related to dealing with the left sided decortication we were
unable to ablate his carcinoid and left that for another
date.  The patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.
