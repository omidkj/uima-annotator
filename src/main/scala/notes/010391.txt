Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 80 yo F with CAD s/precent DES to mid LCX and proximal
OM in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin,
multiple lung lesions on CT chest concerning for lung cancer,
DM2, and demetia who was transferred from OSH for respiratory
distress. Pt initially presented to OSH for depression as has
been at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33012**] unit since [**5-11**]. She was initially
started on avelox for RLL infiltrate on CXR and leukocytosis to
13. A rapid response team was called on [**5-21**] for mental status
changes, blood pressure of 90/40, HR 49, RR 20, O2 sat 79% on RA
improving to 100% with NRB. EKG showed sinus brady, no acute
ischmemic changes. BS was 248. IO was placed. Pt was acutely
agitated and required 2 mg IV haldol. She was transferred to the
ICU. During this time, she had coughed up a small amount of
stomach secretions. Antibiotics were changed to cefepime and
vancomycin. She was also given lasix 60 mg IV (previously
received IVFs for Na 122, Cr 2.9 from 2.0 on admission),
solumedrol 80 mg IV x1. She was also transfused 2 or 3 units
PRBCs for HCT 22.3 (from 31.1 on [**5-12**]) with IV lasix 20 mg. She
was having episodes of anxiety/agitation requiring haldol 2 mg
IV x2 and ativan 1 mg IV x2. ABG was 7.23/46/306.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt was agitated on arrival, calmed with ativan 1 mg
x1. During episodes of agitation, pt would require NRB to keep
O2 sats in the mid-90s. Off NRB, O2 sat was in the 80s. This has
occurred 3-4 times today. Pt also required q4 nebulizers
(atrovent only). ABG was 7.37/39/65 on NRB. Pt also missed 2
doses of metoprolol, went into afib with RVR, which responded to
dilt 10 mg IV x2. SBP dipped to 90s with the dilt.
.
Pt unable to given an extensive ROS given delirium. Reported
terrible breathing. Denied CP, palpitation, nausea, abdominal
pain.

EKG:

[**5-22**] cxr ap: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-28**], there
is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion. Areas of increased opacification
at the right base and possibly behind the heart could merely
represent a combination of vascular congestion and atelectasis,
though
possible aspiration must be considered. Blunting of the right
costophrenic angle is consistent with pleural fluid.
The apparent hiatal hernia seen on the previous image is not
definitely appreciated on the current study. The nodular
opacifications seen on CT are difficult to appreciate on this
plain radiograph.
.
[**5-25**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], the pulmonary
vascularity has somewhat decreased. Haziness at the right base
is less prominent, though some of this may reflect a more
upright position. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists
as does opacification of the left base most likely representing
pleural effusion with underlying compressive atelectasis.
.
TTE [**2197-5-26**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo woman with CAD s/p DES [**3-13**] on plavix, who was transfered
from OSH due to respiratory distress.
.
# Pneumonia: During this admission the patient was treated with
a 7-day course of antibiotics for suspected hospital acquired
pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn with resolution of the
symptoms.
.
# NSTEMI:  Most likely secondary to demand ischemia from
increased metabolic demand of pneumonia.  The pt's troponin
peaked at 1.39 and trended down on labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion
abnormality. In the MICU, the pt was originally on heparin IV
for presumed NSTEMI; however, this was discontinued afted 24
hours as the pt's troponin trended down once the pt's heart rate
and hypoxia were treated. The pt never endorsed chest pain and
besides atrial fibrillation with rapid rate on telemetry during
the first 24 hours of the admission, the pt had no other
abnormalities on telemetry.  The patient was discharged on
aspirin, plavix, statin and metoprolol.
.
# Acute CHF exacerbation: Diastolic heart failure LVEF>55%. The
acute exacerbation was likely caused by NSTEMI and a fib with
RVR.  Initially the pt was admitted to the medical floor, but
was trasnfered to the ICU for treatment of her hypoxia as she
required transient bipap. The pt responded well to diuresis with
lasix 40 IV bid.  She was transitioned off BiPAP and did not
require any additional lasix once transfered to the floor.  She
will have VNA at home to monitor daily weights.
.
# COPD flare: During the pt's MICU course the pt was given
nebulizers as well as a 5-day prednisone burst that she
responded well to.  She was transitioned to a quick prednisone
taper on discharge.  She was discharged with ipratropium inhaler
and albuterol PRN.
.
# Acute MS changes:  Most likely secondary to multiple medical
problems including hypoxia on admission.  The pt's delirium
improved with remeron, treatment of the above causes of the pt's
hypoxia.  Zyprexa was used as needed for symptom management, but
not required many days prior to discharge.
