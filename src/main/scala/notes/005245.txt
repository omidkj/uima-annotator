Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old
female with a history of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, congestive heart failure and atrial
fibrillation, who presents after slipping on the ice while
getting into a taxi cab.  She fell onto her knees.  She did
not hit her head.  She had no loss of consciousness.  She had
no residual pain in her knees.  The patient also reports over
the past two to three days increased shortness of breath with
exertion, no chest pain.  She does have a cough and has been
experiencing chills as well.  She has postnasal drip and
increased fatigue overall.  The patient states she got into
the cab, felt short of breath, decided she did not want to go
to her final destination and got back out of the cab, tried
to walk to the house/apartment, felt short of breath.  Some
passers-by noticed that she was struggling to walk back to
her house and activated EMS.  The patient has been coughing
up a little bit of white yellow sputum.  She reports no
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She has had some increased
difficulty with swallowing liquids by self report over the
past couple of weeks.  She states "sometimes it just goes
down the wrong pipe".

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No dark stools, no blood in the stools,
no urinary symptoms.  No history of recent headaches.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of breast cancer, status post lumpectomy,
radiation and treatment with Tamoxifen.
2.  History of syncope in [**2158**].

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Aspirin, reactions are unknown.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Synthroid.
2.  Verapamil.
3.  Lasix.
4.  Coumadin.
5.  Amiodarone.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone.  She is very independent.
She has a fifty pack year tobacco history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, her
temperature was 98.8 degrees, blood pressure 112/50, heart
rate 114, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 93% in room
air.  The patient was lying in bed, comfortable, breathing
with some effort.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination revealed a right surgical pupils, left pupil that
was reactive.  She had moist mucous membranes.  Her neck was
supple.  She had slightly elevated neck veins.  On chest
examination, she had end expiratory wheezing heard throughout
all lung fields.  She had some transmitted upper airway noise
as well.  Cardiac examination demonstrated an irregular
rhythm.  Heart sounds were difficult to appreciated secondary
to the breathing.  The abdomen was obese, nontender, bowel
sounds present.  Extremities were warm.  She had areas of
erythema on the right lower extremity, 2+ pitting edema on
the right, and 1+ pitting edema on the left.  Neurologically,
she was alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II
through XII are intact.  Motor strength was [**5-14**] throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, she had a white blood cell
count of 4.4, 74% neutrophils, 16% lymphocytes, and 9%
monocytes.  Her hematocrit was 39.0%.  Platelet count
162,000.  Her Chem7 revealed her sodium was 133, potassium
3.4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 27, blood urea nitrogen 33,
creatinine 1.5, glucose 165.  INR was 2.3.

Chest x-ray demonstrated no evidence of pneumonia or
congestive heart failure by report.  Her electrocardiogram
showed no acute ST changes and was significant only for
atrial fibrillation rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Impression was for an 89 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation now
presenting with a two to three day history of cough,
postnasal drip, increased fatigue, shortness of breath.
Physical examination was significant for some diffuse
wheezing plus right erythematous, edematous lower extremity.

In terms of her shortness of breath, she had an interstitial
pattern of pulmonary disease on chest x-ray but no overt
evidence of pneumonia.  The differential diagnosis includes
an upper respiratory tract infection versus community
acquired pneumonia versus pulmonary embolus versus Amiodarone
toxicity versus radiation changes.

In terms of possible pulmonary embolism phenomenon, the
patient was anticoagulated.  Despite that, lower extremity
Dopplers were checked and they were both negative for deep
vein thrombosis.

In terms of her history of radiation exposure and Amiodarone
toxicity, we checked a CAT scan of her lungs that showed some
new upper zone ground glass opacities of unclear significance
but thought possibly to be a superimposed viral infection on
top of chronic changes that have previously existed in the
lungs.

In terms of a possible community acquired pneumonia, we
started treating her with Levaquin 250 mg once daily for a
ten day course which she tolerated well.  We had an incentive
spirometer to her bedside.  We had the nursing staff perform
chest physical therapy with her.  Her oxygen saturation
remained stable at 94 to 96% on two liters which is unclear,
this may possibly be her baseline.

In terms of the leg cellulitis, we initially started treating
her with Ancef for a ten day course, however, we decided to
discontinue the Ancef and just continue the treatment with
Levaquin as Levaquin will cover some of the skin flora that
may be causing the infection.

In terms of her history of coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, we
continued her Verapamil, Amiodarone and Coumadin.  She was
also on Lasix 20 mg twice a day which she tolerated well.

In terms of her hypothyroidism, we continued her Synthroid.

On hospital day two, we had physical therapy staff evaluate
the patient and they felt that she was below her baseline in
terms of functional mobility and could benefit from a short
stay in acute rehabilitation facility.  On hospital day
three, we had the patient perform a speech and swallow
evaluation which showed no evidence of aspiration and normal
swallowing physiologic function.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged on
hospital day six in stable condition.
