History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo with history of dementia, COPD, Afib, and
recent PE (Dx [**3-17**]) on coumadin who was admitted from her
nursing home on [**7-20**] with several days of increasing dyspnea and
hypoxia to 81% on 3L NC.  Per review of the NH records, it
appears she also had increased cough productive of brown sputum
as well some fatigue.

In the ED, she received solumedrol 125mg IV x 1.  Although the
team wanted to obtain a CTA to evaluated for PE, she became
increasingly agitated after the dose of steroids and they were
unable to obtain imaging despite trying 5mg of haldol.
Moreover, PE was felt to be low on the differential given that
her INR was 4.9 on presentation.

On the floor, the team admitting her felt that she most likely
had a COPD exacerbation superimposed on some mild heart
failure/volume overload.  They were treating her with 60mg lasix
daily (increased from 40mg daily at NH) and levofloxacin.  Her
home prednisone was continued at 5mg daily.

On the morning of transfer to the ICU, her oxygen saturation
dropped from 95 to 85% on 4L.  She was noted to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation with a rate of 123.  She had rales b/l and
elevated [**Last Name (LF) 22116**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the team gave her an extra dose of lasix 60mg
IV x 1.  Her heart rate improved after metoprolol 5mg IV x 3,
but she remained hypoxic with oxygenation of 90% on 10L face
mask and was transferred to the unit for further care.

Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was refusing to converse
with the doctors because she reported it worsened her shortness
of breath.  She endorsed orthopnea as well.

Brief Hospital Course:
74yo woman with h/o AFib and PE on coumadin admitted with
hypoxia likely due to COPD exacerbation. She was subsequently
transferred to the unit in the setting of worsening hypoxia and
flash pulmonary edema due to a fib with RVR.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was originally
admitted for hypoxia that was attributed to COPD exacerbation,
she was started on Levofloxacin and steroids. She was then noted
to go into A. Fib with RVR on her second day of admission where
she was noted to have flash pulmonary edema and was transferred
to the ICU. In the ICU she was noted to have a worsening left
pleural effusion as well as a possible infiltrate. She was noted
to have ongoing respiratory distress on [**7-21**] that attributed to
a combination of the pleural effusion, underlying parenchymal
disease, pulmonary edema as well as questional PNA. Pt was
intubated and started on hospital acquired pneumonia coverage of
cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin (day 1 = [**7-21**], although
she did start levofloxacin on [**7-20**]). She has completed this
course before discharge. She was also given IV Furosemide,
continued on her chronic prednisone of 5mg daily. Her home
advair, atrovent, and albuterol was continued.  Following
improvement with oxygenation status she was extubated on
[**2110-7-26**] and transferred to the floor on nasal canula 3L. This
was weaned over time back to room air with her oxygen saturation
remaining 96-100%.  She had been getting 40mg IV lasix daily.
She will be discharged on the equivalent lasix PO 80mg daily.
Please check chemistries on [**Date Range 2974**] [**2110-8-1**] and again on [**Month/Day/Year 766**]
[**2110-8-4**] to ensure increase in her creatinine.

# AFib with rapid rate:
Stimulus for A. fib with RVR likely hypoxia given her clinical
status at that time. She improved rapidly with metoprolol IV 5mg
x 3 doses.  In the ICU, her home metoprolol and diltiazem were
continued and she had no further episodes of RVR.  Note that
during prior admissions, she was not on coumadin because of
"fall risk."  This will need to be readdressed in future once
she has completed coumadin course for her PE (see below). In
addition, her CHADS2 score is 4 and she should be on coumadin
for this.

# ST depressions / elevated troponin:
Lateral ST depressions are not new and are likely related to her
LVH.  She had a borderline elevated troponin which may have been
demand related.  She denied chest pain.  Her aspirin and
metoprolol were continued.

# Likely UTI:
Treated to completion with cefepime for E coli UTI.

# diarrhea: she had antibiotic associated diarrhea. She was
ruled out for C diff. The diarrhea resolved 2 days after the
antibiotic course completed.

# Recent PE, diagnosed [**3-17**]:
Coumadin dose was reduced while on antibiotics and she was
subtherapeutic on day of discharge after the an
