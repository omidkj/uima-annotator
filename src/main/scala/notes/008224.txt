CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Ventral abdominal wall hernia with findings consistent with
small-bowel obstruction with transition point at the inferior
aspect of the ventral hernia on the right.
2. 11.5 cm x 2.5 cm fluid collection deep to the surgical bed in
the left lower abdominal wall. Small foci of free
intraperitoneal gas and subcutaneous stranding consistent with
recent surgery.
3. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Emphysema.
5. Right lower lobe and right middle lobe patchy airspace
opacities consistent with aspiration Vs. frank pneumonia.
6. Limited examination for pulmonary embolus due to bolus
timing. However, no large central pulmonary emboli are
demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
On POD0, the patient was admitted to surgery and was brought to
the OR for open repair of a umbilical hernia.  The patient was
transferred from the PACU to the floor with an epidural, NGT,

d/c'ed. On POD2, patient was awaiting bowel function and diet

was made NPO.  On POD4, the patient was transferred back to the
floor. On POD5, the foley was d/c'ed, and the patient remained
NPO.  On POD6 the patient's vital signs and physical exam
remained stable.  On POD7 his NGT was d/ced, and ID saw him and
recommended 10-14 days of empiric antibiotics.  He was placed on
levo, flagyl, plus vanco for wound erythema.  On POD8 his diet
