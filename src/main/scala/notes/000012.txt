remainder of his postoperative course was essentially
unremarkable. [**9-22**] due to an elevated WBC ct. blood and urine
cultures were sent and empiric antibiotics were started. Urine
Cx originally positive and sensitive to ABX but repeat finalized
negative. The  WBC ct improved to normal and his temp.remained
afebrile, at time of discharge blood cultures were pending, it
was decided to continue a full week of antibiotic coverage. He
