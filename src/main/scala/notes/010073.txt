History of Present Illness:
This is a 69-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, pulmonary interstial fibrosis and chronic renal
insufficiency, Hep C, psoriatic arthritis who presents with 1.5
wks of dyspnea and nightsweats for one year.  He was seen in the
office of his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26225**], yesterday with complaints
of right leg discomfort, and swelling of his right leg. He was
referred to [**Hospital3 **] ED for eval and declined admission going
AMA. He was called and asked to come back as he was noted to
have some CHF but declined. Late in the afternoon he was finally
convinced to be admitted with a diagnosis of shortness of
breath/CHF.
.
He reportedly had vague complaints of chest discomfort on the
right, and somewhat on the left, a variable cough, vague chills
but no fever and was noted to be short of breath especially with
inclines, stairs, and exertion.  At baseline he can walk up two
flights of stairs, but over the last week he has had decreasing
exercise tolerance and now   No orthopnea or PND. He was
admitted, diuresed, and underwent an echocardiogram which showed
severe aortic regurgitation and aortic deformity. He is being
transferred for further evaluation for possible bacterial
endocarditis.

Here, he was found to have aortic and tricuspid valve
vegetations, with aortic lesion on the non-coronary cusp.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] from Cardiac Surgery was notified.  He was admitted to
the CCU for management of bacterial endocarditis and CHF.  ROS
also notable for neck pain, history of blood stools.

C Diff neg on [**10-18**] and [**10-19**]

[**10-16**] ECHO - The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is a
moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve. No aortic valve
abscess is seen. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a moderate vegetation on the
tricuspid valve. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CXR:
[**10-16**] - No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
though
there is no evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Probable small
pleural effusions bilaterally with extension into the major
fissure on the
right. Bibasilar atelectatic change without definite focal
pneumonia.

[**10-20**] - AP single view of the chest demonstrates the presence of
a
left-sided PICC line seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the
level 1 cm
below the carina. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related
complication is identified. The pulmonary vasculature does not
demonstrate any remaining congested pattern and no new acute
infiltrates are seen.

CT Abd [**10-16**]:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis and
consolidation of the lung bases.
2. Tiny rounded hypodensities in bilateral kidneys, too small to

characterize.
3. No evidence for parenchymal infarcts within the abdomen.
4. Complete loss of disc height at L1-2, with irregular endplate
sclerosis. There are no prior studies for comparison. While this
is most likely secondary to severe degenerative disease,
correlate with any symptoms referrable to the lower lumbar
spine, as infection may have a similar appearance in the
appropriate clinical context.

Head CT [**10-16**]:
1. Mild brain atrophy without hemorrhage on head CT.
2. No evidence of an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size on CT
angiography of the head.
3. It should be noted that mycotic aneurysm in the peripheral
branches of the intracranial arteries could not be excluded by
CT angiography.

Carotid US [**10-19**]: No hemodynamically significant stenosis within
the right or left internal carotid arteries.

Knee X-ray [**10-21**]:
1. No acute fracture detected.
2. Joint effusion.
3. Osteoarthritis.
4. Chondrocalcinosis -- differential diagnosis include CPPD.
5. Prepatellar soft tissue edema.

Cardiac Cath [**10-19**]:
No coronary disease


Brief Hospital Course:
69 M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, IPF, Hep C, and psoriatic
arthritis presenting with bacterial endocarditis and CHF
exacerbation.

BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS - On presenation pt had a transesophageal
echo showing tricuspid and aortic vegetations and severe aortic
insufficiency.  History of nightsweats for months and
progressive dyspnea argued against acute endocarditis, as does
appearence of vegitations and regurgitation on multiple valves.
Given his heart failure in the setting of endocarditis he was
evaluated by cardiac surgery for emergent valve replacement who
deferred surgery until after antibiotic course as pt was
hemodynamically stable.  Pt was initially treated with
Vancomycin, Gentamicin (dosed by levels) and Zosyn and when OSH
BCx grew nutritionally varient strept, was switched to
Vancomycin, Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone. Cultures were then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for reevaluation by our ID team regarding
sensitivities for narrowing of antibiotics. He had daily blood
cultures for several days but all cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] were
negative. He also had daily EKGs to look for PR prolongation as
a result of endocarditis/abscess indicating need for urgent
surgery.
Pt was cleared for surgery with multiple pre-op screening tests
including normal carotid ultrasound, head CT, cardiac cath and
dental eval with panorex.
Prior to discharge pt had a left PICC line place to complete a
6wk course of antibiotics as an outpt.
