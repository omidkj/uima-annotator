HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 38 year old
male transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital early on the morning
of [**2177-11-14**], with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia,
abdominal pain and nausea.  The patient reports that two
friends brought a bottle of "Midori" to the house last
Thursday.  He states that they were attempting to poison him.
He notes feeling suspicious of them because the bottle was
already open.  They did not drink any of it.  He became
violently sick the next day and he noted that the Midori
tested like a sweet liquid.  Despite his suspicions, he drank
three large glasses of it.  There is some question that he
was drinking vodka earlier in the evening.  Although he
states these friends did this to him, he cannot describe any
possible motive they might have and refuses to reveal their
names.  He denies feeling concerned or afraid at this time
and does not plan to report the incident to the police.  The
patient admits to drinking alcohol on a daily basis.  He
states he checked himself into detoxification facility on
Tuesday after having several days of severe nausea, vomiting
and abdominal pain.  It is unclear what he did from Thursday
to Tuesday.  The patient denies that it was any kind of
suicide attempt.  He reports feeling in good spirits and not
wishing to ever do himself any harm.  He states that he has
his family to live for but has not seen his sister for three
months.  Three years ago when his mother died, she ask him to
keep the family together which he states is impossible.  He
was checked into a detoxification facility [**2177-11-9**].  He
reports feeling poorly, continuing to have nausea and
vomiting and abdominal pain.  On [**2177-11-13**], he says that he
had not urinated since entering the program.  At [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital, his blood urea nitrogen was 183 and creatinine was
60 with a bicarbonate of 14 and anion gap of 18.  On arrival
to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department, he seized and was treated with Ativan.  He was
then admitted to the MICU and was treated with emergent
hemodialysis for a bicarbonate of 7 and potassium of 6.0.
His creatinine at that time was down to 22.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was afebrile, heart rate
95, blood pressure 153/93, respiratory rate 22.  The patient
was 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  In general, he is a 38 year
old male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Anicteric
sclera.  Neck is supple.  Lungs revealed diffuse bilateral
wheezing.  Cardiovascular is tachycardic, normal S1 and S2,
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologically,
alert and oriented times zero, moving all four extremities
spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 15.2, hematocrit
42.0, platelet count 216,000, 81% neutrophils, 10%
lymphocytes,  Sodium 130, potassium 5.7, chloride 85,
bicarbonate 8, blood urea nitrogen 178, creatinine 22.2,
glucose 132, anion gap 33.  Calcium 9.5, magnesium 3.1,
phosphate 16.3, troponin 0.08.

Chest x-ray shows mild congestive heart failure.  Head CT
negative for bleed, but small hypodensities bilaterally
towards the vertex in the frontoparietal region.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per
minute.  Normal intervals.  Questionable nonspecific changes
in the T waves in V1 through V6.  No acute ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Acute renal failure - Initially, the patient was treated
in the MICU with emergent hemodialysis for a bicarbonate of 7
and potassium of 6.0.  It was felt likely acute tubular
necrosis secondary to ingestion most suspicious for ethylene
glycol although difficult to diagnose as the patient
presented seven to eight days after possible ingestion.  He
was also anuric times two weeks.  Renal ultrasound showed
enlarged kidneys bilaterally with left measuring 14
centimeters and right measuring 13 centimeters.  No stones
and no hydronephrosis.  No oxalate crystals were seen in his
urine.  Now after two weeks, his urine output is beginning to
increase to 200cc per 24 hours.  His initial laboratories on
[**2177-11-14**], were negative for ethylene glycol, acetone methanol
and isopropanol with a serum anion gap of 33 and plasma
osmolar gap of 15 but acute renal failure may cause both
elevation in the serum anion gap and osmolar gap, making
these uninterpretable.  The patient will likely not require
biopsy if his urine output continues to increase and he will
likely be discharged to a rehabilitation facility and
follow-up for outpatient dialysis treatments as necessary and
follow-up with renal in clinic.

2.  Serum anion gap and plasma osmolar gap - Suspected
polyethylene glycol ingestion although complicated by the
fact that acute renal failure can cause both to be elevated.
Both gaps are improved now.  No calcium oxalate crystals are
seen in the urine.   Urine output continuing to increase.

3.  Decreased mental status - Concern for intracranial
hemorrhage initially but head CT negative for bleed.  Small
hypodensities found in the vertex near frontoparietal region
likely secondary to toxic metabolic damage secondary to
ingestion.  The patient had seizures on arrival to the
Emergency Department [**2177-11-14**], and was treated with Ativan.
These were felt to be likely withdrawal seizures from
alcohol.

4.  Hypertension - Poorly controlled hypertension while in
the hospital with evidence of some fluid overload and
possible element of diastolic dysfunction secondary to
ingestion.  He will be continued on Metoprolol 150 mg p.o.
Three times a day, Hydralazine 25 mg p.o. four times a day,
Clonidine patch and Norvasc 10 mg p.o. once daily.

5.  Increasing white blood cell count - White blood cell
count initially was 15.2 and has now increased up to 23.0.
He has unclear source of infection and this may possibly be a
leukemoid reaction to his ingestion.  Urinary analysis was
negative.  KUB examination is negative.  Blood cultures are
no growth to date.  We will check a repeat chest x-ray
although he has had no infiltrates on past chest x-rays.

6.  Pulmonary - The patient with intermittent desaturation
into the high 80s with increased blood pressure and crackles
on examination.  Likely secondary to fluid overload and
improved saturation with tighter blood pressure control and
more frequent dialysis.  Will check a chest x-ray today to
rule out any pneumonia.

7.  Code Status - Full.

8.  Disposition - The patient will likely be discharged to
rehabilitation facility with outpatient dialysis treatment
when white blood cell count is improved and his hypertension
is controlled.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol XL 450 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Hydralazine 30 mg p.o. four times a day.
3.  Sevelamer 800 mg p.o. three times a day a.c.
4.  Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Calcium Acetate two grams p.o. three times a day with
meals.
6.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Multivitamin one tablet p.o. once daily.
8.  Diazepam 5 mg p.o. q6hours p.r.n.
