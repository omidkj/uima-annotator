Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed, transfer from [**Hospital6 **]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory Laparotomy
Total Abdominal Colectomy with Hand Sewn Two-layer Side to End
Ileo-Rectal Anastomosis
Omental pedicle Flap


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old man with CAD s/p stent in [**8-22**], HTN,
asthma, h/o LGIB in [**11-22**] secondary to diverticulosis requiring
coil embolization by IR, who presented to an outside hospital on
[**2168-3-2**] with BRBPR.  He was in his usual state of health until
the afternoon of admission when he developed rectal bleeding,
passing BRBPR and clots.  He also complained of mild dizziness
on waking up in the morning several days prior to presentation.
He denied any CP, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea.
.
On admission to OSH, VS: T 98.6, HR 78, BP 179/81, RR 15, O2 sat
98% on RA.  Hct was initially 44.5, but then decreased to 37.7
and then 33.1 over the next 24 hours.  A tagged red cell scan
showed active bleeding near the hepatic flexure, which was
embolized by IR on [**2168-3-3**].  On [**3-5**] he was started on clears
because no further bleeding had been noted.  That evening he was
noted to again have BRBPR, multiple episodes.  He remained
hemodynamically stable.  Hct decreased 31-7 -> 29 and he was
transfused 1U PRBC.  Repeat hct remained 29 with continued BRBPR
noted and he was transfused another unit prior to transfer here.
 SBP remained 130s, HR 70s.  He had a repeat tagged RBC scan
which showed recurrent bleeding at the same spot (hepatic
flexure) and a second embolization procedure was recommended.
This would not be available at [**Hospital3 **] for several days, so
he was transferred here.
.
On arrival, he feels well but anxious.  He continues to have
BRBPR every 1-2 hours.  He denies any CP, SOB, abd pain, N/V,
dysuria.
.
Of note, he had a prior LGIB in [**11-22**]. This occurred in the
setting of starting aspirin and plavix in [**8-22**] following MI and
stent placement.  At that time he had a colonoscopy and a
bleeding site was cauterized.  Two days later he re-bled and had
an emblization by IR. His plavix had been stopped after his
bleeding episode, and he has been maintained on low-dose aspirin
since that time.

DIAGNOSIS:


Ileocolectomy:



1.  Multiple diverticula of the [**Doctor Last Name 499**] without perforation.



2.  Small adenomas of the [**Doctor Last Name 499**], two.



3.  Multiple petechiae in cecal/ascending colonic mucosa,
non-specific

.

4.  No colitis or neoplasia.



5.  Ileal segment and appendix, within normal limits.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2168-3-13**] 5:40 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated loops of small bowel with multiple air fluid levels.
Given the patient's surgical history, it is difficult to
differentiate between ileus versus obstruction on plain
radiographs. Suggest continued observation with abdominal
radiographs and CT if necessary.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 71 year old man with a history of CAD, HTN, past LGIB
who presented to an OSH with BRBPR.  S/p angio and embolization,
but transferred due to recurrent bleeding and need for repeat
angio.
.
GI bleed: Hct stable.  LGIB, likely diverticular given past
history.  s/p angio at OSH, but with recurrent bleeding.
Hemodynamically stable, s/p 2U PRBC at OSH.  Tagged RBC scan
indeterminate here due to presence of too much background
(recent prior nuc med scan).  Angio showed no active bleeding,
therefore, no embolization.  Pt did not have bloody BMs here,
but hct trended during the first few days. He was transfused a
total of 5U PRBC here (+2 at OSH) so far.  Serial hcts were
checked, he was placed on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI and was taken to the OR for
colectomy on [**3-9**]. ASA was held during this time.
.
**He went to the OR on [**2168-3-9**] for a Total Abdominal Colectomy.
.
Left eye irritation: He reported to theAnesthesia doctors of [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] irritation. He received drops and ointment and his symptoms
improved.
.
GI: He was NPO with an NGT and IVF. The NGT was D/C'd POD 2. He
was started back on sips on POD 3. He was noted to have
abdominal distention and tympany on exam. He was NPO and a KUB
showed dilated loops of small bowel with multiple air fluid
levels, most likely a ileus. We awaited return of bowel
function. He continued to have burping and was spiting up bile
and was also having loose stool. He had a NGT placed, for a
post-op Ileus, the evening of POD5 and got 2L of dark bilious
fluid out. He was still round, distended and nontender.
A PICC line was inserted on POD 6 and he was started on TPN.

He was started back on a diet on POD 9 and his diet was slowly
advanced over the next few days. He was tolerating a regular
diet at time of discharge.
.
Post-op Hypovolemia: He urine output was low and so he received
several fluid boluses over POD [**4-24**]. His NGT output was initally
high, 2-3 liters/day and he was bolused IV fluid to repleat this
NGT fluid loss. On POD 7, his urine output began to pick-up and
was WNL.
.
Post-op fever: he spike a temp to 101 on the night of POD 7.
CXR, Blood and urine cultures were done and showed a +UTI,
ENTEROCOCCUS SP. He was started on IV Ampicillin and then was
switched to PO Augmentin and will complete his antibiotic course
at home.
.
Pain: He had a PCA for pain control and had adequate control.
Once tolerating a diet, he was switchec to PO Percocet.
.
Post-op Hypertension/Tachycardia: In the PACU, he was
hypertensive to 160-170/60 and HR to 100. He received additional
10mg IV Lopressor and responded well. Once on the floor, his
Lopressor was increased to 15mg q6h. He was then switched to PO
Lopressor once tolerating a diet.

h/o CAD: S/p stent in [**8-22**].  No evidence of active ischemia or
chest pain during his stay.  Held BB, ASA and ACEI d/t bleed.
Was continued on lipitor and started on
