Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for ASA desensitization and cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 yo female with a history of DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, CHF, CAD, stable angina, who presented to [**Hospital 6451**] on [**10-25**] with worsening dyspnea and substernal
pressure-like CP.  The patient has basline dyspnea at rest which
worsens with exertion. She also has episodes of angina about
once/wk which may occur at rest and are relieved by rest or NTG.

.
On the day PTA, the patient had been climbing stairs in her home
when she tripped and fell. She noticed feeling more dsypneic
than usual and had a 10 min epi of SS chest pressure rated [**8-11**]
with associated diaphoresis. No radiation,
N/V/LH/palpitations/neck or arm pain. The next morning the
patient was still diaphoretic and short of breath and was told
by her friend that she didn't look good. She went to the ER at
[**Hospital3 417**]. Of note, the patient had noticed that she had
increasing LE edema but denies an increase in salt intake or
medication noncompliance. She complains of 2-pillow orthopnea at
baseline but no PND.
.
While at [**Hospital3 **], the patient was found to be fluid
overloaded with a BNP of 1070 and was diuresed. She had elevated
CE with Trop I 1.46. She underwent a persantine myoview stress
test which showed resversible ischemia in the antero-apical area
of the LV with mild dyskinesis of the L ventricular apex. A TTE
showed an EF 55-60%. The patient has an allergy to ASA (throat
constriction and rash) and was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ASA
desensitization and ccath.
.
On the floor, the patient denied any CP, SOB, N/V/D. She denied
any diarrhea or constipation, fever, chills, myalgias, HA,
dizzyness, LH, dysuria, hematuria, frequency, urgency,
hematochezia, or palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80 yo female with a history of DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, CHF, CAD, angina, with CHF exacerbation and
demand ischemia/angina with elevated Trops who was found to have
a reversible antero-apical defect with mild dyskinesis of the L
ventricular apex on stress test at an OSH and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for ASA desensitization and ccath. The following issues
were addressed during this admission:
.
1. Cardiac:
A. CAD: The pt was found to have ischemia with elevated Trops
and a reversible defect on P-MIBI at an OSH. She was started on
a heparin drip at the OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization and ASA desensitization. The patient
likely had demand ischemia with a troponin leak secondary to her
CHF exacerbation as her CP resolved after 10 min. As it was not
thought that she had an acute coronary syndrome, the heparin was
discontinued upon arrival. Her cardiac catheterization showed an
80% stenosis of the D1 was found and not intervened upon.
Optimization of medical management was recommended and the
patient was started on Imdur 30mg QD and Norvasc 5mg QD. The
patient remained asymptomatic and without chest pain during the
duration of her hospitalization. Although she had been placed on
metoprolol at the OSH, this medication was discontinued
secondary to bradycardia. As she had no reaction to the aspirin
desensitization, she was started on aspirin 162mg QD during this
admission. The patient was started on low dose lipitor and
continued on loasartan.
.
B. Rhythm: The patient remained in NSR throughout her
hospitalization.
.
C. Pump: The patient's systolic function was preserved with an
EF of 55-60% (OSH records). She likely has diastolic dysfunction
given her long standing HTN and DM. The patient had been
aggressively diuresed at the OSH and was only slightly volume
overloaded upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Her lasix was changed to
HCTZ/Triampterene as it will help with BP control in addition to
diuresis. She was kept on a low sodium diet, daily weights and
I/Os were recorded. The patient has an appointment with her PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-2**] and will need close follow up of her electrolytes.
.
2. ASA desensitization: The patient was given increasing dosages
of aspirin per the [**Hospital1 18**] aspirin desensitization protocol
without complication. She was then started on aspirin 162mg QD
s/p cardiac catheterization.
.
3. HTN: The patient has a longstanding history of HTN. Her BP
was controlled on Losartan 50 mg QD, Norvasc 5mg QD, and Imdur
30mg QD. The metoprolol was discontinued secondary to
bradycardia.
.
4. DM: The patient was continued on glargine 20 u Qhs and a HSS.
She received a diabetic diet.
.
5. Glaucoma: The patient was continued on latanoprost,
betaxolol, brimonidine, and carbachol eye drops.
.
6. hypercholesterolemia: The patient was started on low dose
lipitor 10 mg QD and should follow up with her PCP for further
management.
.
7. GERD: The patient was given protonix for her GERD.
