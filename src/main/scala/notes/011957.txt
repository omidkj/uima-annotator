[**2119-6-28**] Pathology specimen:(Cava Tumor)
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Tumor #2, cava (A):
Small cell carcinoma consistent with a lung primary, see note.

2.  Cava tumor (B):
Small cell carcinoma consistent with a lung primary, see note.

The tumor cells are positive for TTF1, CD5/6, p63 AE1/3, CK CAM
5.2, cytokeratin cocktail and CK7.  The tumor cells are negative
for LCA, CK20, Chromogranin, synaptophysin, WT-1, HepR1, CEA
unabsorbed and CD10.  These findings, particularly the positive
for TTF1 and CD56 support the lung origin or a small cell
carcinoma.




Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2119-6-28**], she was taken to the OR with plan to explore the
lesions and then proceed with the resection. Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Ex lap was performed noting extent of tumor. It
was deemed unresectable. Biopsy was taken of the liver/caval
tumor. Please refer to operative note for further details. She
was sent to the SICU postop for management. She was extubated
without incident. Urine output was on the low side and IV fluid
boluses were given with improved urine output. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test
revealed cortisol level of 29.3. Repeat cortisol levels was 33
and 22. She had some nausea with emesis and was given IV Zofran
with relief.

Postop, vital signs remained stable. Pain was managed initially
with IV morphine pca. This was switched to dilaudid with
improved pain control. However, she continued to experience
incision and back pain. Chronic pain service was consulted and
recommend continuation of scheduled tylenol with prn dilaudid.
Neurontin and tizanidine were added. Recommendations for
Tizanidine were 2-4mg po q 8 hours and Neurontin 300mg at HS
with increase to tid as needed. This regimen worked fairly well
to decrease her pain.

Diet was slowly advanced.  She did experience some nausea and
fullness. Zofran was given initermittently. Dulcolax pr was
administered without results. Fleets enema was given with BM.
Milk of Magnesia was given on day of discharge. On day of
discharge, she was tolerating small amounts of regular food plus
supplements.

Incision remained intact, without redness or drainage. Staples
were removed and incision steri stipped on day of discharge.

She did experience cough with O2 desaturations to 85%. CXR
demonstrated bilateral
lower lung opacifications consistent with pleural effusions and
compressive
basilar atelectasis. Breath sounds were diminished on the left
base greater than the right base. .  O2 nasal cannula was placed
on the patient with increased O2 sats to 92-93% on 2 liters.
During ambulation, she required a venturi mask plus nasal
cannula.

Atrius heme/onc was consulted. Recommendations were to obtain
CEA and CA [**27**]-9. Results were 2.3 and 22. Pathology report of
caval tumor demonstrated small cell carcinoma consistent with
lung primary. Recommendations for f/u treatment were with
discussed with patient and husband once recovered from surgery.
A f/u visit was set for [**7-12**].
