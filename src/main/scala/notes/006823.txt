Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
asystolic cardiac arrest, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
central line placement, Arterial line placement
ERCP with biliary and pancreatic stents placed
biloma pigtail catheter placement and removal
ERCP for pancreatic stent removal


History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with COPD and intestinal malrotation with recent
cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis s/p cholecystectomy c/b
 bile leak transferred from the ERCP suite after
intra-procedural hypoxia and bradycardic vs. asystolic cardiac
arrest.
.
The patient was admitted with cholecystitis and gallstone
pancreatitis to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center 07.02-23.08. A
cholecystostomy tube was placed. Post op course was complicated
by sepsis (thought due to enterobacter bacteremia though not
confirmed in records) complicated by ARDS requiring ICU
admission.  The pt was then readmitted with fevers/ dysuria on
[**2124-8-23**] [**2-26**] apparent E. Coli urosepsis with positive urine and
blood cultures. Following initiation of imipenem, cultures
cleared by [**2124-8-28**] (imipenem was continued for an estimated [**8-1**]
days). Her hospital course was c/b volume overload
(documentation of this problem is limited), abdominal pain and
emesis necessitating re-operation. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
was converted to open cholecystectomy with Ladd's procedure
(fixation of malrotation) on [**2124-9-1**]. She developed post-op
anemia with a nadir of Hct 24.7. Her post-op course was
complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (Cr peaking 3.0)
thought [**2-26**] oliguric ATN that resolved with IVF resuscitation;
post-op possible ileus vs. obstruction (documented on plain film
on [**2124-9-6**]), and bile leak confirmed by subsequent CT scan and
HIDA scan on 08.15-16.08. An ERCP attempted on [**2124-9-11**] at OSH
was aborted due to failure to access and repair the biliary
tree.
.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent ERCP. During the ERCP,
the pt developed acutely hypoxia, and subsequent bradycardia and
hypotension, leading to the calling of a code blue. Chest
compressions were initiated, and 1mg atropine x2 and 1mg
epinephrine were administered leading to return of spontaneous,
palpable pulse at a rate of 160 with hypotension to the
systolics 70-80's. SBP were maintained with a neosynephrine
continuous infusion. An attempt was made during rescucitation
for central line placement in the internal jugular vein with
return of fluid that was serous possibly consistent with
aspiration of a pleural effusion.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
- Recent choledocholithiasis and gallstone pancreatitis s/p open
cholecystectomy c/b bile leak
- Recent multidrug resistent E Coli urosepsis (2/2 blood cx, on
[**2124-8-23**]; negative as of [**2124-8-28**])
- CRI baseline Cr 1.5
- Diastolic CHF EF 65%, mild TR
- HTN
- H/o asthma and COPD
- Intestinal malrotation s/p Ladd's procedure

Pertinent Results:
OSH labs:

None more recent for comparison.
UA ([**2124-9-5**]): 200 WBC, 1 RBC, 2 squams, Pos Leuk Esterase.

([**2124-8-28**]): No growth.([**2124-8-29**]): No growth.
Imaging:
OSH CT abd/pelvis ([**2124-9-8**]): Large bilateral pleural effusions.
Consolidation in the RLL. unchanged since [**2124-9-4**]. Fluid
surrounding the dome of the liver. 13 cm Fluid collection in the
gallbladder fossa contiguous with collection extending down the
right flank. Air within the gallbladder fossa. Increased
abdominal fluid since [**2124-9-4**] which may reflect increased
ascites, bile leak or possibly abscess/infection.
.
U/S guided paracentesis ([**2124-9-8**]): 300cc aspiration of dark
brown/green fluid sent for culture and sensitivity. Residual
loculated fluid int he gallbladder fossa noted.
.
HIDA scan ([**2124-9-9**]): Active bile leak with extension into the
subhepatic space and right paracolic gutter.
.
KUB and left lateral decubitus ([**2124-9-6**]): Mild ileus vs.
partial small bowel obstruction.
.
TTE ([**2124-8-1**]): LVEF 65%, Mild AR, TR, minimal pericardial
effusion. Mild RV enlargement with normal biventricular
function. Abnormal diastolic filling pattern. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
