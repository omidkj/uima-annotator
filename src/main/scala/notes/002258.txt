History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 39729**] is a 42-year-old woman with history of chronic
mesenteric ischemia s/p R hemicolectomy/[**Female First Name (un) 899**] reimplantation in
[**6-9**], HTN, hypercholesterolemia who presented to the ED with
intermittent, exertional SOB. Patient reports further worsening
in breathing status over past several days, with milder exertion
required to elicit shortness of breath; associated with
non-productive cough, generalized weakness, and dizziness. No
chest pain, fevers, chills, vomiting, black stool.  She does
intermittently pass blood clots in her stool which was thought
to be due to internal hemorrhoids. No syncopal episodes. LMP
earlier this month, no heavy or unusual bleeding. Given
persistence of symptoms, she sought evaluation in the ED.
.
In the Emergency Department, initial VS were T 98.3; BP 120/52;
HR 93; RR 15; O2 98%RA. She received a CTA to rule out PE given
elevated d-dimer, which was negative. Hct results then returned
at 19.0, and she received 2 units PRBCs. She also received 40mEq
potassium and 1L NS IV bolus given low BP in 90s.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient reported that she was feeling
much better. Denied chest pain or shortness of breath.
Pan-review of systems negative including cardiac, GI and GU.

Pertinent Results:
EGD with small bowel enteroscopy on [**2140-11-16**]:
Ulcers in the antrum (biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Normal mucosa in the jejunum

Brief Hospital Course:
#Anemia/Dyspnea/Lightheadedness - Symptoms attributed to anemia
from GI bleed given  guiac positive stools. Pt's crit bumped
appropriately to 3U PRBC, and was kept above 28 given her
history of vascular disease.  Pt was on Plavix because of her
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] stent, which was initially held in the context of GI
bleeding, but restarted on HD2.  GI was consulted who proceeded
to perform a small bowel enteroscopy on [**11-16**] which revealed
oozing ulcers in the antrum of the stomach.  Punch biopsies were
taken at that time to assess for H. Pylori which on discharge
are pending.  Their recomendations were to start Prilosec 40 mf
po BID.

#Peptic Ulcer Disease: Hematocrit stabilized, ulcers found in
antrum of stomache with signs of recent bleeding.  GI suggests
[**Hospital1 **] Prilosec.  Dr. [**Name (NI) 3407**], pts vascular surgeon was contact[**Name (NI) **]
re: anti-platelet therapy.  He emailed that he only would ask
for aspirin daily as tolerated, and does not feel Plavix is
necessary from his standpoint.  In the past, the neurology team
had started pt on Plavix and in their notes had referred to it's
benefits in setting of pt's PVD.  Pt discharged and told to
continue full dose aspirin and to discontinue plavix.  Please
have hct rechecked on [**2140-11-22**] when pt visits PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**].

#EKG Changes - Patient with inferolateral downsloping ST changes
in setting of Hct 19.0, that were new compared to [**2140-7-3**]
study. Pt was started on ASA 325. Pt denied chest pain and ruled
out for MI by enzymes x3.   Cardiology was consulted who felt
that these changes were likely demand ischemia in the setting of
anemia, and their interpretation of the ECGs indicated that they
felt that the new ST changes were resolving with transfusion.
TTE showed no wall motion abnormalities. Cardiology's
recomendation was to follow up in clinic for assessment and
workup of likely CAD given her extensive history of vascular
disease. Follow up [**Year (4 digits) 1988**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in 12/[**2140**].

#Hypotension - Pt was transiently hypotensive to the 90's in the
ED for which she was fluid resucitated with 1L of NS.  Her
anti-hypertension medications were held in this setting. She
remained stable through remainder of hospital course with SBP in
the 90s.  She was told to continue beta blocker (given concern
for cardiac ischemia) but to discontinue HCTZ and verapamil
until re-assessed by PCP.

#Sore Throat - Pt reported having had a sore throat for several
months at this admission, which was exacerbated by swallowing
and occassionally impaired her breathing.  ENT was consulted who
gave the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, and
recomended high dose PPI and follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic in [**4-8**]
weeks.

#Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia - Pt reported having no acute
abdominal pain since her surgery in [**Month (only) **].  She was on plavix due
to the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] stent which was placed.  The plavix was initially
held while an acute GI bleed was ruled out, but then restarted
when the problem appeared to be more chronic. Vascular was
consulted, and they had no new recomendations at this time. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] emailed that pt does not need Plavix at this time.

#Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Continued dicyclomine, no changes
made.

#Hyperlipidemia - Continued Zocor, pt had good lipid levels in
[**Month (only) 205**].

#Depression and Anxiety - Continued fluoxitine but held
nortriptyline based on cardiology recomendation that
nortriptyline can increase orthostatic hypotension. Pt will
follow up with her PCP in one week to determine whether she
needs to restart nortriptyline.
