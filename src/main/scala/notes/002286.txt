Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, Left leg swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
62yo woman with history of hypertension presented to [**Hospital 191**] clinic
on day of admission with multiple complaints including chest
pain radiating to her left shoulder, shortness of breath on
exertion, cough, and worsening LLE swelling and pain x 2 days.
On initial exam, her vitals were stable: T 97.7, BP 126/84, P65,
RR10 98%RA. Her exam was notable for LLE swelling and warmth.
She was sent to the ED for further evaluation. In the ED, her
evaluation was notable for the following: clear chest film; CTA
demonstrating bilateral PE's; LLE LENI with extensive DVT in
left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins,
also extending into greater saphenous; also found to have acute
coagulopathy, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
She was also found to have BRBPR. GI was consulted, and
recommended to perform bowel prep in anticipation of colonoscopy
in AM. Surgery was consulted as well, and agreed with plan for
anticoagulation for PE's and further investigation for GI
bleeding by GI.
.
On interview on the floor she is alert, oriented, very pleasant,
and in no distress. She confirms that over the past several days
she has had exertional dyspnea, chest pain (described as dull
pressure, [**5-29**], mid-sternal with radiation to bilateral
shoulders, not clearly pleuritic) and worsening LLE swelling and
pain. She also reports several recent bouts of upper respiratory
symptoms after exposure to her grandson who is an infant in
daycare (reportedly had RSV bronchiolitis recently). Otherwise,
she denies any fever, chills, n/v, lymphadenopathy, night
sweats, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain/increased
girth, or pruritus. She does report one episode of BRBPR on day
prior to admission after having bowel movement. ROS otherwise
negative. She also reports a worsening dry cough since she has
been in the hospital. She did not have a flu shot. She does not
report any long plane/car trips, no prolonged bed-rest. She
notes that the swelling in her L leg has improved since being in
the hospital.

CTA CHEST:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, with probable
developing infarction in the left lingula.
2. Left pelvic vein clot from imaged portion of common femoral
to the confluence of the common iliac veins, likely the source
of pulmonary emboli. No definite extension to the right common
iliac vein or IVC.
3. Large hemangioma in liver.
4. Colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. Left adnexal cyst, unusual in a postmenopausal patient. This
should be further evaluated with pelvic ultrasound on a
nonemergent basis.

LENI:  Extensive acute DVT within the entire left lower
extremity deep venous systems. No right DVT.

ECG:  Sinus rhythm. Non-specific junctional ST segment
depressions. Compared to the previous tracing this finding is
new.

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

PELVIC US: Fibroids, follicular activity left ovary, right ovary
not seen, thrombus in the left iliac vein


Brief Hospital Course:
1) DVT/PE:
Patient was started on anticoagulation with heparin for
extensive PE/DVT (LLE).  This was continued despite bleeding.
Once the bleeding has stabilized, she was started on coumadin.
She was discharged on a lovenox bridge to coumadin.

In terms of workup for cause of this thrombosis, pt had a pelvic
US to further evaluate mass since on CT as potential malignancy.
 But there was no evidence of ovarian malignancy.  She was up to
date on other cancer screening.  Factor V leiden and prothrombin
gene mutation were pending at time of discharge.  The rest of
the hypercoagulable workup will have to be done once acute
thrombosis resolves.

The left leg swelling improved throughout the admission.  Pt was
instructed to keep the leg wrapped most of the day.  And to keep
it elevated when lying in bed or sitting.

..

2) GI BLEED:  Flex sig showed diverticulosis so this bleeding
was secondary to that.  Pt did have blood loss anemia requiring
transfusions.  During the last 5days of the admission, there was
no clinical bleeding and her Hct was stable to slightly
improving.  Aspirin was held.  Verapamil was also held and not
restarted as pt's BP was well controlled in house.

..

3)  HTN:  As above, verapamil was held.

..

4) COAGULOPATHY:  On admission, pt had thromboctyopenia, low
fibrinogen.  This was felt to be due to consumption and factors
improved once anticoagulation was started.  There was no
evidence of frank DIC.

..

5) PNEUMONIA:  Several days into the admission, pt developed a
low grade temperature and cough.  Though this was most likely
due to pulmonary infarction, levaquin was started for pneumonia.
 Pt's cough improved with this and she completed a 5d course of
levaquin before discharge.
