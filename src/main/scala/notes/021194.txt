Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right foot ulceration secondary to
femoral-tibial disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white male
hospitalized from [**2102-1-17**] to [**2102-1-25**] for nonhealing right
foot ulceration, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
infection, Clostridium difficile infection, and pneumonia.
The patient was treated for a left lower lobe pneumonia with
ceftriaxone 1 gram IV x10 days, Vancomycin 1 gram q24h for
his methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus wound
infection.  This was begun on [**2102-2-2**].  The Flagyl for his
Clostridium difficile was 500 mg tid which was begun on
[**2102-2-4**].

The patient underwent an arteriogram during his
hospitalization on [**2102-1-19**] which demonstrated diffuse aortic
disease with a left renal artery stenosis of 60%.  The SFA
was totally occluded, the profunda femoris at 80% stenosis to
AK [**Doctor Last Name **] was with plaque, and the tibioperoneal trunk was with
stenosis.  The run-off was via the AT and peroneal.

Patient's elective surgery was deferred until pulmonary
status and treatment of his pneumonia.  He returns now on
[**2102-2-5**] for elective revascularization.  The patient denies
any interval changes, fever, cough, shortness of breath, or
chest pain.  Denies glucose changes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  He was afebrile.  Blood
pressure 140/60, heart rate is 78-86, respirations 24, and O2
sat is 92% on room air.  HEENT examination is alert and
oriented.  He is in no acute distress.  Normocephalic.
Tongue is midline, but fissured.  Lungs:  There is a left
lower lobe and left lateral pleuritic rub.  Left base was
with coarse breath sounds and rales.  The right lung fields
are clear to auscultation.  There is no wheezing.  The heart
is irregularly, irregular rhythm with a 1/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the base.  There is no rubs or gallops.  Abdominal
examination was soft, nontender, nondistended, active bowel
sounds x4.  Peripheral vascular examination shows left arm
swollen without vein prominence.  The IV site is oozing clear
fluid.  He has no carotid bruits.  Pulse examination shows
palpable femorals bilaterally, absent popliteals bilaterally,
F and DPs bilaterally.  The PT on the right is absent.  The
right radial pulse is palpable.  The graft pulse on the left
is palpable, and the DP is absent.  The radial pulse is
palpable, but diminished on the right.  The right foot shows
dry eschar at the hallux.  There is no erythema, induration,
or drainage.  Neurologically he is oriented x3 and grossly
intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Vascular Unit.
He was prepared for anticipated elective surgery for the
following day.  It was noted upon admission examination that
the patient's left upper extremity was swollen.  An
ultrasound was obtained which demonstrated an axillary deep
venous thrombosis.  Intravenous Heparinization was begun.
The line was discontinued.

The patient underwent on [**2102-2-7**], a right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] with
nonreverse saphenous vein.  He tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  The
intraoperative course was complicated by ongoing atrial
fibrillation and increase in his pulmonary artery pressures
at the 70s and 80s systolic and 30s-40s diastolic.

The patient in the PACU was extubated and required
reintubation less than 15 minutes after extubation secondary
to hypotension.  The patient was also bradycardic.  He was
given 1 mg of atropine and Epinephrine to IV.  Chest
compressions were begin.  He was stabilized with amiodarone
bolus of 150 and .................... bolus to Esmeral was
titrated for heart rate.  His systolic blood pressure
required Neo-Synephrine support for greater than 100.

Transesophageal echocardiogram done showed massive bilateral
atrial enlargement, thrombus in the left and right P.A.
Moderate MR.  The left ventricular systolic function was
preserved with inotropic support, but the ventricle was
enlarged with hypokinetic right ventricle and left pleural
effusion.

The patient was begun on a Heparin drip.  He was transferred
to the SICU for continued care.  His postoperative hematocrit
was 35.8.  His white count was 22.7, BUN 20, and creatinine
0.4.  Fibrinogen was 167.  CPK initial was 97.  MB and
troponin 0.7.  Blood gases on 100% with PEEP was 7.37, 46,
170, 628, 1.  At 70% with PSI of 5 and 5, he was 7.32, 33,
97, 29, and 0.

Cardiology followed the patient postoperatively.  Clinical
nutrition service saw the patient on postoperative day two.
Recommendations were made for TPN.  TPN was begun.  Renal
service was requested to see the patient because of oliguria.
By postoperative day two, the patient still remained
intubated requiring amiodarone for rate control.  Fluconazole
was started secondary to yeast in the urine and sputum.
Vancomycin was started because of episodes of hypotension
with a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
endocarditis.

The patient remained intubated and in the SICU.  Renal felt
that the oliguria was secondary to ATN secondary to ischemia
or hypotension.  Recommended maintaining systolic blood
pressure of 150-130s per renal perfusion.  Because of his
increasing bilateral pleural effusions, a right chest tube
was placed for drainage, which initial drainage was 700 cc.

Patient developed thrombocytopenia on Heparin and a Heparin
induced antibody titer was sent.  The results were negative.
Patient was eventually weaned off his vasopressor inotropic
support by postoperative day #4.  He remained intubated.
Patient was extubated on postoperative day five, but required
reintubation.  Levofloxacin was instituted and maintained a
mean arterial pressure from 70s-80s.  He requires Lasix IV
drop to improve urinary output.  His renal ultrasound was
negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis.

Patient showed a leukocytosis on postoperative day #5 of 27.6
with 92 polys and no bands.  General Surgery was consulted
regarding questionable cholecystitis.  Ultrasound of the
right upper quadrant demonstrated no intrahepatic dilatation.
Common bile duct was 5 mm.  There were no stones.  The
gallbladder wall was edematous with fluid around the
gallbladder.  There is questionable cholecystitis.
Recommendations for cholecystostomy.

The next 24 hours, the patient's temperature defervesced and
white count showed a decline to 15.9 and cholecystostomy tube
was deferred.  Patient was re-extubated on postoperative day
nine, and patient self discontinued his Dobbhoff tube.
Continued on his TPN and attempts were made to feed
Vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl, and fluconazole were
continued for a total of seven days.

The patient underwent a swallowing evaluation on [**2102-2-14**]
which demonstrated overt signs and symptoms of aspiration
with honey-thick liquids and puree.  Recommendations were to
continue the patient NPO, and attempt to replace the
nasogastric tube and reconsult at a later date for
re-evaluation.

Right chest tube was discontinued on [**2102-2-15**].  Podiatry was
consulted on [**2102-2-16**] regards to the nonhealing medial
ulceration on the right first MPJ joint.  Recommendations for
treatment.  Recommendations were continue with conservative
treatment and dressing changes.

The patient was transferred to the VICU on postoperative day
11 that was [**2102-2-17**].  A bedside assessment was made by the
Speech and Swallow service, and
