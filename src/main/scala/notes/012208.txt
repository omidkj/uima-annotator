History of Present Illness:
Fall of [**2124**] when she developed
the insidious onset of hoarseness/change in voise and local neck
discomfort. Symptoms continued, so she was referred for ENT
evalution in [**2125-12-30**]. She subsequently underwant an FNA
on [**2126-4-25**] that revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. She then
underwent a left hemithyroidectomy at [**Hospital 792**]Hospital by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69509**] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2126-5-23**]. Surgery was complicated by
recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Pathology revealed multifocal
papillary thyroid carcinoma. She sought a second opinion with
Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] Bie who performed a completion thyroidectomy in [**2125-12-30**]. At the time of surgery, extensive local disease was
identified with residual tumor on the left thyroid bed and
mediastinum engulfing local vascular structures and the trachea.
She was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further debulking of
mediastinal disease.

Pertinent Results:
Swallow study [**2126-8-24**]
INDICATION: Status post sternotomy for metastatic thyroid
cancer.
STUDY: Oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation.
FINDINGS: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing video fluoroscopic
evaluation was performed in conjunction with speech and swallow
pathology. Thin liquid, nectar thick liquid, puree consistency
barium, and a cookie coated with barium were orally
administered. The patient demonstrated piecemeal behavior by
dividing up boluses into multiple swallows regardless of size of
consistency of the bolus. There was subsequent premature
spillover into the valleculae. However, consecutive sips of
fluid from the cup did not exhibit piecemeal behavior,
suggesting possible action secondary to anxiety for aspiration.
There is no evidence for esophageal leak. All consistencies
demonstrated free passage into the stomach, without gross
esophageal injury. A dedicated esophageal evaluation would be
necessary to more fully evaluate the esophagus, if there is high
clinical suspicion for injury. There is no evidence for
aspiration.

For further details, please consult the speech and swallow note.

IMPRESSION: Peacemeal swallowing but no evidence for aspiration.


STUDY: AP chest, [**2126-8-25**].

HISTORY: 65-year-old woman with desaturation.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2126-8-24**].

Median sternotomy wires are seen. There are vertical and
transverse skin staples identified. There has been improvement
of the right-sided pleural effusion and the left-sided pleural
effusion appears worse. However, these findings may be
positional in nature. The opacity in the right upper lobe on the
prior study is less well seen on today's study. There is also a
persistent left retrocardiac opacity. There is atelectasis seen
within the right suprahilar region.
