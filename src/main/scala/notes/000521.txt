Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
81 year-old woman with an unknown past medical history, who
presents as a transfer from [**Known firstname **] Hospital after being found
down with possible PEA arrest; Neurology has been consulted for
the finding of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage on imaging.

Although few details are known at this time, the patient was
found down for an unknown duration.  Emergency medical services
arrived on the scene and the patient was in cardiac arrest
(possibly pulseless electrical activity).  The full initial
management has not been detailed in the available documentation,
but the patient arrived at [**Known firstname **] Hospital on a dopamine drip
at
approximately 2:20 pm.  Initial vitals included: temperature
95.0
F, pulse 152, blood pressure 138/66, and SaO2 100% on an ambu
bag.  There she was intubated and sedated on Propofol; a
neurologic examination is not detailed on available
documentation.  She was loaded with 1 gram Cerebyx and
administered a dose of Zosyn.  Initial evaluation revealed a
leukocytosis with left shift (68 polys and 17 bands), normal
coagulation studies (INR 1.1), glucose 370, CO2 16 with an anion
gap of 22, BUN 24, creatinine 1.2, and elevated cardiac enzymes
(CK 359 and MB 21.5).  Chest x-ray showed infiltrate versus
atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  EKG showed SVT, rate 151.
CT of the head revealed a possible right basal ganglia
hemorrhage
without mass effect.

The patient was transferred [**Hospital3 **] and arrived here at
~8:00
pm.  The Propofol was held and a dose of Versed was given for
sedation.  One gram vancomycin was administered.  Neurology was
called for evaluation.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 98.4 F  BP 148/82   P 92    RR 22    SaO2 100 on
ventilator
General: elderly woman, intubated
HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, orally intubated
Neck: Hard C-collar in place
Lungs: clear ventilated breath sounds
CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, no organomegaly appreciated
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated
Skin: abrasions noted on legs

Neurologic Examination (off Propofol for ~30 minutes):
Mental Status:
Eyes open, not interacting with environment. Not following
commands.

Cranial Nerves:
No papilledema noted; no blink to threat.  Pupils 4 to 3 mm on
the left and 5 mm and unreactive on the right.  Eyes
midposition.
No response to corneals and nasal tickle.  Reportedly coughed
when orogastric tube placed.

Sensorimotor:
Intermittent decerebrate posturing.  Posturing to noxious in the
upper extremities.  Stereotyped triple flexion to noxious in
lower extremities.  There is an intermittent full body jerk that
emerges when decerebrate-type posturing is noted.

Reflexes:
Difficult to elicit in upper extremities due to posturing, brisk
at knees, with clonus at ankles.  Toes were upgoing bilaterally.


Coordination and gait: Unable.

EEG [**6-23**]: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the burst
suppression
pattern described above. This can be due to sedating medications
such
as Propofol, but it persisted over 20 minutes after the
medication was
stopped. Alternatively, a severe encephalopathy, including one
caused
by anoxia, could explain the findings. There were no
electrographic seizure seen.

[**6-22**]: CT Head: 1. Findings concerning for development of large
left MCA territory infarct.
2. No significant change in appearance of 1 cm right sub-insular
hyperdensity.
While this may represent a small intraparenchymal hemorrhage, an
underlying
vascular malformation (i.e., cavernoma) or neoplasm are
diagnostic
considerations.

CXR: Tubes and lines positioned appropriately. Left retrocardiac
density may
represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
81yF w/ h/o a. fib admitted with large L MCA stroke, pna, UTI
after being found down with PEA arrest.  Unclear how long she
had been down or the inciting incident.  She was initially
treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for infections, neo to
maintain BP over 120 while on propofol for sedation. Her neuro
exam and EEG were consistent with severe anoxic brain injury due
to her PEA arrest.  Her Living Will was obtained and a family
meeting with the brother [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name2 (NI) 802**] [**Name (NI) **] was held where
the decision was made to withdraw care as this was most in line
with her expressed wishes.  She was extubated and care was
refocused to comfort care only.  She passed away on [**2157-6-24**] at
920pm.
