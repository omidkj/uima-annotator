History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F alzhiemer's dementia (AOx1-2 baseline), sick sinus
syndrome s/p pacer, recent admission [**Date range (3) 59861**] for
pneumonia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis,
acute delirium, pancreatitis and pyelonephritis presents from
rehab with hypoxia to 70% on RA.  Of note, she was treated from
[**Date range (1) 59862**] with levofloxacin 750mg IV q48 for
community-aquired PNA.  Her oxygen requirements were 2L on
admission and was 94% on RA on discharge.  Mental status waxed
and waned but improved on discharge and she was evaluated by
speech and swallow and felt to be safe to eat.  She also had [**Last Name (un) **]
with creatinine of 1.5 on [**2186-4-28**] which trended down to 0.9 on
discharge and felt to be due to relative hypotension (BPs in the
100s) which improved with BPs rose to 130s-140s.  She was
hypertensive during the admission requiring IV hydralazine for
BP control.  During this admission she also had transaminitis
thought to be possibly from statin use and pancreatitis with
lipase of 900s.  She had CT abd and U/S which were unrevealing.
She was given 20mg IV Lasix daily from [**Date range (1) 8762**] but not
discharged on standing lasix.

In the ED, initial vs were: T95.4 P65 (paced) BP92/54 R20 O2
sat99% NRB. Patient was given levoquin, vancomycin, and zosyn.
Patient was hypothermic and started on Bair Hugger.  Blood
pressures initially 150s systolic, then became hypotensive into
the mid to low 90s.  Received 3 L of NS fluid resuscitation.
BPs were in low 100s on transfer to the floor. CXR that showed
worsening PNA, RUL opacity, bibasilar opacities.  She was given
Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin.

On the floor, she is somnolent and answers few questions.  She
denies pain.  She is more responsive for her family.  Per her
family, mental status has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] since her
previous admission.  Prior to this admission she was functioning
well at home, living with her daughter.

IMAGES / STUDIES:

[**2186-5-10**] ECG: A-V paced rhythm. Since the previous tracing of
[**2186-4-26**] A-V delay is decreased.

[**2186-5-10**] CXR: PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lung
volumes are low. There is a left pacer/AICD with leads extending
to the expected location of the right atrium and right
ventricle, unchanged. There is increased right pleural effusion,
with associated right lower lobe volume loss. There is increased
opacity in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure.
Increased opacity is also identified at the left base. This may
reflect layering effusion and atelectasis, though superimposed
pneumonia is not excluded. The cardiac contours are difficult to
evaluate given the low lung volumes. There is prominence of the
right hilar structures, though this may be secondary to
rotation, given lack of right hilar abnormality on recent chest
CT. The pulmonary vasculature is prominent, consistent with
fluid overload. The aorta is again noted to be calcified and
tortuous. Upper abdomen is unremarkable. There is no acute
osseous abnormality. IMPRESSION: Bilateral effusions, increased
on the right, mild CHF. Basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis
versus pneumonia.

[**2186-5-10**] LUE ultrasound: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color
son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging of the left internal jugular, subclavian,
axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was performed.
The contralateral subclavian vein was interrogated for
comparison purposes. There are symmetric respiratory phasicity
in subclavian veins. Left upper extremity veins demonstrate
normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. There is no
echogenic intraluminal thrombus identified. There is minimal
soft tissue edema in the antecubital region. IMPRESSION: No
evidence for DVT in the left upper extremity.

[**2186-5-11**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion. Impression: severe
diastolic left ventricular failure and secondary right
ventricular failure. Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2185-10-12**], severe tricuspid
regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are now evident.

[**2186-5-11**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay. Delayed R
wave progression with late precordial QRS transition. Diffuse T
wave changes. Findings are non-specific. Since the previous
tracing of [**2186-5-10**] A-V paced rhythm is now absent.

[**2095-5-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is slight improvement. The extent of the bilateral pleural
effusions is slightly decreased. As a consequence, there is
improved ventilation of both lung bases. Unchanged moderate
