History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 57 y/o female with DM I s/p multiple admissions for
DKA, mostly in the setting of E. coli ESBL UTIs. Pt reports her
diabetic gastroparesis has been worsening over the past two
days, and reports worsening of her nausea and [**First Name3 (LF) **] yesterday
([**First Name3 (LF) **] 6x, bilious, non-bloody, over past 24 hours). Unable
to keep down her oral medications, but has been compliant with
her insulin regimen of Lantus (22 U qAM and 28 U qPM, takes 18 U
QHS if blood sugars are low) and HISS. Endorses diffuse
abdominal pain that is mostly concentrated and sharp,
non-radiating in her LUQ that is similar to her gastroparesis
pain. Denies any fevers, has chronic dry cough non-productive of
sputum, new rashes, or dysuria. Has been constipated for
approximately 3 weeks but is passing gas. Reports some tan/green
vaginal discharge for past few days as well. This morning she
awoke and was noticed to be altered by her daughter. EMS was
called and noted a critically high BS. She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.5 117 115/54 24 100% on RA.
Patient was given 3 L IVFs, 2 amps of calcium gluconate (for
peaked T-waves on EKG), 10 U IV insulin with insulin gtt. R IJ
was placed in the ED due to poor IV access and needs to be
pulled back about 3 cm. Labs significant for Na 127, K 6.5, Cre
2.3 (baseline 0.9), glucose of 1186, and anion gap of 38,
lactate 7.7. Urine positive for ketones. pH 7.03/16/73/5 (VBG).
Head CT without any acute intracranial process. EKG abnormal at
baseline but with slightly increased depressions in V1-V3. Pt
noted initially to be alert and mentating but not making sense
(knew her name and birthday).
.
On the floor, patient noted to be AOx2 (name, hospital), but was
asking to be washed up by her [**Name6 (MD) **] although RN had mentioned

Pertinent Imaging
CT head without contrast  ([**2136-2-8**]):
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter
differentiation is preserved. There is no edema or mass effect.
Ventricles
and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The paranasal
sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.
.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process
.
CXR ([**2136-2-8**]):
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Right IJ central line with its tip in the right atrium;
pulling back
approximately 3 cm is recommended; no evidence for pneumothorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old female with Diabetes mellitus admitted with diabetic
ketoacidosis likely precipitated by acute gastroenteritis two
days prior to admission.
.
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis: . Patient initially presented with
confusion and altered mental status in the setting of nausea and
[**Month/Day/Year **] x 1 day related to gastroparesis vs gastroenteritis.
She was found to have glucose to 1186, and anion gap of 38,
lactate 7.7. Creatinine was noted to be 2.3, above baseline 0.9.
Urine positive for ketones, negative for leuks/nitrates. pH
7.03/16/73/5 (VBG). She was treated with agressive fluids (total
of 10L) and placed on an insulin drip. Glucose trended down,
magnesium, phosphorus and potassium were repleted and the
patient was transitioned to D5W until the anion gap closed.
Insulin drip was discontinued and patient was started on basal
and parandial insulin. She was discharged with a plan for follow
up with [**Last Name (un) 387**].
.
2. Acute kidney injury: Likely volume depletion as Creatinine
improved from 2.3 on admission to 0.8 on the day of dischrage.
Likely related to pre-renal failure.
.
3. Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin Dependent:  Please see #1.  She
was followed by the [**Last Name (un) 387**] while in house. Patient was
transitioned to basal and prandial insulin. Reglan for diabetic
gastroparesis was continued on discharge
.
4. Vaginal discharge: Patient complained of vaginal discharge,
exam showed white, creamy discharge consistent w
