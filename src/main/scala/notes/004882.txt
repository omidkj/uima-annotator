History of Present Illness:
Chief Complaint:  SOB

Reason for MICU transfer:  hypotension

81 year old male with h/o CHF (EF 20%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2166**],
afib on warfarin, VT s/p [**Year (4 digits) 3941**] placement, GI bleed secondary to
?NSAID use, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease s/p right SFA stent last
week, ?dementia, presented with SOB.

In the ED, initial VS were:  08:02 0 97.8 83 92/74 18 98%.  He
triggered for BP 60s. Physical exam was notable for red blood on
rectal examination.  Labs were notable for Hct 26 (at discharge
[**7-3**] was 27.5), INR 2, Cr 1.9 (baseline 1.5). Also trop 0.61
with ECG showing no changes by report.   BNP 5900, Lactate 2.8.
Patient was started on peripheral dopa but was tachy to 130s and
switched changed to peripheral norepinephrine.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is comfortable and conversant.
He [**Month/Year (2) **] any pain and has no acute complaints.  His
norepinephrine was decreased from .1 to 0.6 mcg/kg/hr.

There was initial concern for upper GI bleed.  Pt reports dark
brown stools with drops of blood at home, and reports state 1x
500cc melanotic stool in the MICU.  GI was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**], and stool
was dark red, more consistent with lower GI/diverticular bleed.
EGD was not performed because of high risk cardiac status and
higher suspicion for lower GI bleed.  Baseline HCT 27-28, on
admission HCT 26, rec'd 1U PRBCs, now 29, stable since
admission.

Pt has a complex cardiac history and severe peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
disease.  He has afib on warfarin. Had SFA stent placed last
week, started plavix.  Also started 10 day course of TMP/SMZ
post-procedure.  Also has [**Month/Year (2) 19874**], with EF 20%, mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation, and RV dysfunction, on [**2175-7-10**] TTE.
Cardiology [**Year (4 digits) 4221**], no acute intervention recommended.  Pt
will require lifetime anti-platelet therapy.  Per [**Year (4 digits) 1106**]
surgery, plavix 30 days followed by aspirin for life.  He has
CAD s/p CABG x 4 in [**2-/2166**], and VT s/p dual-chamber [**Year (4 digits) 3941**]
placement.  On admission troponin 0.61 --> 0.47 --> 0.56.


Unsure of patient's baseline MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**7-11**], became combative,
tried to leave.  Touched base with daughter and health care
proxy, [**Name (NI) **], see social history for details.  Does not understand
reason for admission or circumstances that brought him to the
hospital.
