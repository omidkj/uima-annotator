Crohn's disease, congestive heart failure and a recent
presented to an outside hospital with melena, hematocrit of
17.  The patient was supratherapeutic on her Coumadin dose on
[**3-20**] and asked to hold her Coumadin value, uncertain and
on [**3-21**], developed melena, shortness of breath and
presented to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital.  She received 2 units of
packed red blood cells and 4 liters of fluid, stabilized and
was transferred.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Crohn's disease, currently treated
with Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q. day with questionable
compliance; 2.  Asthma; 3.  Congestive heart failure; 4.
Hypothyroidism.  The patient is supposed to be taking 40
mcg/day of Levothyroxine which he has been noncompliant with;
5.  Pulmonary embolism, [**2139-2-14**];  6.  Stroke last year
with some residual left-sided weakness; 7.  Cholecystectomy;
8.  Hemicolectomy in the [**2086**], because of an obstructive
walnut; 9.  Arthritis; 10.  Gastritis, gastroesophageal
reflux disease.

day; 4.  Folate; 5. Lisinopril; 6.  Potassium chloride 10
twice a day; 7.  Protonix; 8.  Calcium carbonate; 9.
Combivent; 10.  Dulcolax with Milk of Magnesia; 11.
Erythromycin ointment; 12. Artificial tears.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation the patient's
heartrate was 84, blood pressure 102/47, respiratory rate 20,
sating 98% on 4 liters. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat,
normocephalic, atraumatic. Moist mucosal membranes,
extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Neck supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Obese.
Pulmonary, no wheeze, bibasilar crackles right greater than
left.  Cardiac, distant heartsounds.  Abdomen normoactive
bowel sounds, obese, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities with no edema, 1+ pitting edema, no erythema, no
tenderness.  Neurological, alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII intact, no focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10, hematocrit 20.8,
platelets 140, sodium 144, potassium 4.9, chloride 113,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 94, creatinine 2.9, glucose 93, INR 2.2,
PTT 26.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and received an initial 2 units of packed
red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin
Potassium.  The day following the patient underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy which demonstrated
normal upper gastrointestinal tract, the second part of the
duodenum.  She further underwent colonoscopy and small bowel
follow through which were all negative for the source of
bleeding.  Her hematocrit remained stable from the time of
admission.  It is determined she was intolerant to
anticoagulation therapy given her history of first
gastrointestinal bleed and history of Crohn's disease and all
anticoagulation was stopped.  She underwent inferior vena
cava filter placement on [**2139-3-25**] without incident.

Cardiovascular - She underwent an echocardiogram which
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 66 to 65%.  She has a
history of clinical congestive heart failure with diastolic
dysfunction with a home oxygen requirement of 2 liters.  At
the time of discharge she was euvolemic, sating 97% on room
air.  Her diuretic medications were held while hospitalized
and should be restarted on an outpatient setting with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1075**] or if she develops increased edema, shortness of breath
or crackles.

Endocrine - She was restarted on her Levothyroxine given her
TSH value which was greater than 100 and repeat pulmonary
function tests should be checked in six weeks.

Renal issues - The patient's creatinine improved with
hydration to a value of 1.2 to 1.3 at the time of discharge.
Her acute renal failure was likely secondary to intravascular
dehydration.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day
2.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q. day
3.  Tylenol 325 to 650 p.o. q. 4-6 hours prn
4.  Levothyroxine 50 mcg p.o. q. day

7.  Albuterol metered dose inhalers 1 to 2 puffs q. 6 prn
8.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Dulcolax prn
10. Milk of magnesia prn
11. Combivent inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d.

Of note, the patient should be restarted on her Lasix 40 mg
p.o. q. day and Potassium Chloride 10 mEq p.o. q. day as well
as her Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q. day once her blood pressure
tolerates it.  At the time of discharge her blood pressures
were ranging 110 to 130 systolics/70 to 80 diastolic.
Anticipate she will need reinstitution of these medications
within two to three days.
