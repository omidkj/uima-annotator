Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80yo male with PMH significant for asthma and
dementia who presents now with imaging, labs and physical exam
findings consistent with acute asthma exacerbation in setting of
a RLL PNA and new sepsis presentation.  He had a complicated
medical course and ultimately it was determined to focus on
comfort care given the patient's end-stag dementia and chronic
aspiration. He was discharged to hospice in stable condition.

# Goals of Care:  After a long discussion with the family and
the palliative care service, it was determined that the family
would like to focus on comfort given the patient's end-stage
demetia and chronic aspiration.  Would recommend morphine prn
for dyspnea or pain with bowel regimen and oxygen or fan as
needed to control respiratory symptoms.  Additionally, would
consider scopolamine for control of secretions if clinically
indicated.

# Sepsis/Pneumonia:  Patient presented with fevers to 104,
respiratory rate in 30's, and tachycardic to 130s with systolic
blood pressures in the 90's.  He was admitted to the ICU and
treated with intravenous antibiotics and improved.  He was
transferred to the floor.  He had 2 other episodes of acute
respiratory worsening requiring ICU transfer and non-invasive
ventilation.  These were thought to be secondary to aspiration
of secretions and food.  He completed an 8 day course of
antibiotics for hospital acquired pneumonia after the second
acute worsening.  Family meeting and goals of care as above.

# Chronic Aspiration:  Likely from demetia though speech/swallow
study was essentially normal.  Given that goal of care is
comfort, would allow patient to eat and drink if he wants, but
he does not need to.
# Acute Renal Failure: On presentation, patient's creatinine was
1.4 with a peak of 2.1.  Ultimately improved with fluids to 1.7
without further improvement.

# Dementia:  End stage, long standing hisotry of Alzhemers.
Goals of care as above. Patient appears somewhat confused and
anxious on exam. Would avoid sedating medications.

# Code Status:  DNR/DNI, confirmed with family.

# Contact: Granddaughter [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82848**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82849**].
Daughter is at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82850**].

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted on [**2133-8-23**] with pneumonia and an infection
in your blood.  You were initially treated in the intensive care
unit with IV fluids and antibiotics and you improved.

Because you have end-stage dementia a family meeting was held
and the decision was made to focus on comfort.  Therefore your
medication regimen was changed to focus on comfort.  The
facility you are going to is the nursing home you've been in.
They will manage your symptoms of shortness of breath or pain
with medications to reduce those symptoms.

Additionally, it was determined that you aspirate your saliva
into your lungs which causes lung damage and shortness of breath
and may cause infection.  Unfortunately, there is no way to
prevent this from happening.

You were started on a medication called Clonidine which is a
patch.  This is to control your blood pressure because very high
blood pressure and worsen breathing symptoms.

It was a pleasure meeting you and participating in your care.


Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care doctor as needed.

Please keep all of your scheduled appointments.
