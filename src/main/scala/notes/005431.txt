REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 35% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen
in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity. Moderate global LV
hypokinesis.

AORTA: No atheroma in aortic arch. No atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderately thickened aortic
valve
leaflets. Large vegetation on aortic valve. Aortic root abscess.
Severe (4+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on mitral
valve. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on
tricuspid valve. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 69920**]e
throughout the procedure. The posterior pharynx was anesthetized
with 2%
viscous lidocaine. No TEE related complications. 0.2 mg of IV
glycopyrrolate
was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. No
atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular
cavity is dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. The
transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic
plaque. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately
thickened. There is a large (2 x 0.7 cm) vegetation on the
posterior aortic
valve leaflet. An aortic annular abscess is seen in the
intervalvular fibrosa
(best seen at the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet).
Severe (4+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally
normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small to moderate sized
circumferential
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Bicuspid aortic valve with a large (2 x 0.7 cm)
vegetation on the
posterior leaflet with severe aortic regurgitation. Small (0.4 x
0.8 cm)
abscess that appears to be in the intervalvular fibrous tissue
(between the
aortic valve and mitral valve), best visualized at the base of
the anterior
mitral valve leaflet. The left ventricle is severely dilated
with moderate
global hypokinesis. Small to moderate circumferential
pericardial effusion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2101-12-1**] 9:11 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: lead placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old man with AV endocarditis s/p single cahmber
pacemaker
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
lead placement
CHEST X-RAY WITH PA AND LATERAL VIEWS

INDICATION: Patient is status post single chamber pacemaker
placement.

COMPARISONS: [**2101-11-30**].

Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Again seen is a single chamber
pacemaker with lead wire in appropriate position without change.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Compared to [**2101-11-30**], there
are increased pulmonary markings in a more patchy distribution,
particularly in the right lower lobe that are concerning for an
underlying infectious process. The upper lung zones are
otherwise clear. There are no pleural effusions. The osseous
structures and soft tissues are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. New patchy-like opacities within right lower lobe could
reflect new underlying infectious process. Clinical correlation
advised.
2. No evidence of pneumothorax.
3. Persistent cardiomegaly.








Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the CSRU from outside hospital.
Remained hemodynamically stable.  ID consult obtained.  Since
there was no documented bacteria, broad spectrum antibiotics
were initiated.  He was started on gentamicin (for an empiric 7
day course), Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone (for a week course of
each).  A right pleural effusion was tapped (600 cc straw
colored fluid obtained).
The electrophysiology service was consulted due to the history
of heart block as well as aortic root abscess.  A temporary
pacemaker was placed initially.  This was converted to a
permanent VVI pacemaker on [**2101-11-30**].  It will likely be replaced
with an epicardial lead system when he is ultimately taked to
the OR for an aortic valve/root replacement upon completion of
his antibiotic course.
He was transferred to the telemetry floor where he has remained
hemodynamically stable.
He has had a neurology consult (due to a small frontal lobe
lesion noted on MRI).  This was felt to be a small embolic
infarct, and only a small risk of hemmorhage is likely with
anticoagulation.  They did, however, recommend a full antibiotic
course prior to surgery.
Opthalmology consult revealed a small hemmorhagic lesion in the
left eye which required no intervention.
Hepatology consult revealed no evidence of cirrhosis, and no
contraindication to surgery.
He is to be transferred to [**Hospital6 **] to complete
his antibiotic course (both Ceftriaxone and vancomycin should be
administered through [**2102-1-4**]).  He will then be
re-evaluated for aortic valve/root replacement.
