Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Right leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-3-21**] Coronary artery bypass graft x 3 (left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery)


History of Present Illness:
61 yo man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and a known bicuspid
aortic valve who went to see his PCP [**1-12**] with symptoms of right
calf pain, expressing his concerns for DVT. A routine EKG showed
ST elevations that were thought to be an ischemic process versus
left ventricular hypertrophy versus left axis deviation. He was
sent to the ER for further evaluation.  Troponins were positive
to .21. However, the presence of EKG Q-waves were thought to
suggest that this was a remote event. An echo demonstrated new
anterior lateral hypokinesis, compared to previous studies,
overall LV systolic function was decreased (LVEF 45%) and
demonstrated new wall motion abnormalities. A cardiac
catheterization revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
He has now been referred for surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2163-3-21**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF=45 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There
is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.8cm2) with Cardiac
output 4.0L/min.. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 100303**]. POST-BYPASS: Preserved RV
systolic function. LVEF 45%. The mid anterior and anteroseptal
walls are hypokinetic compared to pre CABG. Surgeon informed of
these findings. With epinephrin only 0.02 mcg/kg/min they
improved signficantly later on. Intact thoracic aorta. Same
valvular findings as before. All wall motions similar to
prebypass after chest closure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100303**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**2163-3-21**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 3. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Later this day he was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Beta-blockers and
diuretics were started and he was gently diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. On post-op day one he was transferred to the
step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. He continued to make
good progress while working with physical therapy for strength
and mobility. On post-op day four he was discharged home with
VNA services and the appropriate medications and follow-up
appointments.
