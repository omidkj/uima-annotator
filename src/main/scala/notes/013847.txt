Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 51 M obesity,  He was brought her by EMS after caretaker
felt pt to have odd behavior for last 2-3 days. He had
increasing confusion. Per EMS, no N/V/F/C/CP/SOB. In the field,
EMS found co2 to be int he 80's and RR 30's. O x 1 in the ED.
.
In the ED, VS 99.6, 65, 139/36, 20, 92% NRB. Exam with
diminished BS, guiace positive with brown stool. ABG with
7.15/130/112/48 on BIPAP. Lab with elevated BUN/Cr, flat CK,
normal LFTs, WBC flat.
.
While in the ED, placed on BIPAP with sats in the mid to high
90's but appeared that pt was tiring out. After evaluating
airway, ED staff felt that he would be a difficult intubation
and therefore a "semielecective" intubation with anesthesia
would be warrented. PIV placed. Groin line placed. Pt dropped
pressures to the 60's and HR in the low 40's. Started on
dopamine, a line placed for BP monitoring. Recieved 500 mg IV
levoquin and 125 mg IV solumedrol in ED.  Also had episode of
vomiting food. While trying to wean dopamine, pt went into
junctional rythym. Patient was intubated and transferred to
MICU. After extubation he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] without
complications.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2185-1-9**] 1:32 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST

Reason: Please evaluate for PE or other pulmonary pathology
Field of view: 50 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
450 pound, 51 year old male s/p intubation with hypercarbic
respiratory failure, now with significant A-a gradient and
failure to wean from vent.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for PE or other pulmonary pathology
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM, [**2185-1-9**]

INDICATION: 51-year-old male status post intubation, with
hypercarbic respiratory failure, with new significant A-a
gradient and failing to wean from ventilator. Assess for
pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 2.5 mm axial images were obtained from the
lung base to the apex following the administration of 150 cc
intravenous Optiray bolus per CT pulmonary angiogram protocol.
Images were reformatted in the sagittal and coronal plane.

FINDINGS: No prior CT examination for comparison. Study is
somewhat limited secondary to patient's body habitus. Central
filling defects are identified within the left descending
pulmonary artery (series 2, images 55 through 57), compatible
with pulmonary emboli. The remainder of the pulmonary arteries
are patent, without filling defect identified. The main
pulmonary outflow tract, measures 35 mm, within the upper limits
of normal. There is no dilatation of the thoracic aorta. The
visualized proximal great vessels are unremarkable.

Endotracheal tube is in position. There are no enlarged
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.

Evaluation of the lung parenchyma reveals bibasilar
consolidation, as well as partial consolidation within the right
middle lobe. Findings could represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No discrete pulmonary
nodules or mass lesions identified.

Evaluation of the osseous structures reveals degenerative change
of the thoracic spine.

Limited evaluation through the upper abdomen is grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Filling defects within the left descending pulmonary artery,
compatible with pulmonary emboli.

2. Consolidation within bilateral lower lobes, and the right
middle lobe. Considerations include atelectasis and/or
pneumonia.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2185-1-9**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - body habitus.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventric
