Persantine stress test showed dilated LV at
stress and rest, global hypokinesis, EF of 23%, anterior infarct
with a large area of peri-infarct ischemia, large inferior
infarct without ischemia. A recent echo showed EF 30%, moderate
aortic stenosis peak gradient 24, mean 13, [**Location (un) 109**] 1.3 cm2 and mild

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2201-6-24**] where the patient underwent urgent
coronary artery bypass graft x2 left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery, aortic valve replacement with a
size 25-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna tissue valve. Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. He
was weaned off antihypertensive drips and oral agents were
added. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  Chest tubes remained in for extra days due to an
air leak.  This was followed via CXR and advanced slowly.
Eventually, CTs were discontinued without complication.  A small
left pneumothorax persisted on CXR following removal of CTs.
Lantus was decreased, and ultimately discontinued for
hypoglycemia. Metformin will be re-introduced slowly.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 5 the patient was ambulating, yet deconditioned, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to [**Doctor First Name 391**] [**Hospital **] Rehab in [**Hospital1 392**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
