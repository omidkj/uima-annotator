Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Pt transferred from OSH for treatment of odontoid fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6105**] is a 79yo male with PMH significant for CHF, atrial
fibrillation, and CRI who presents from OSH with odontoid
fracture s/p mechanical fall. Per patient, he fell on Thursday
after he tried to get up from his bed. He admits to hitting his
head on the floor. He was brought to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital
and was found to have an odontoid fracture. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED his initial vitals were T 96.2 BP 81/60 AR 106
RR 16 O2 sat 92% RA. He received Levaquiin 750mg IV x1 and was
started on Levophed which was turned off upon transfer to the
floor. He had repeat imaging which confirmed the fracture. He
denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, dizziness, abdominal
pain, or bloody/black tarry stools. He does admit to a
productive cough over the past 3-4 weeks.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**]
Hospital from [**Date range (1) 6106**] after he oresented with history of
recurrent dizziness and his blood pressure was found to be in
the low 70's. He underwent several studies including a Holtor
monitor, echo, and PFTs. He was suggested to be discharged to
rehab but the patient refused.

Relevant Imaging:
1)CT Head ([**7-13**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Abnormal
orientation of the dens corresponds to dens fracture, visualized

on the C-spine CT.
.
2)CT C-spine ([**7-13**]): Type II dens fracture.  Posterior offset of
C1 over C2 could indicate possible ligamentous injury.
.
OSH Imaging:
1)CT C-spine ([**7-12**]): Odontoid base fracture with 3mm posterior
displacement of the odontoid tip.
.
2)CT Head ([**7-12**]): No acute intracranial abnormality is present.
There are small vessel ischemic changes of periventricular white
matter and findings of atrophy.
.
3)Holtor monitor ([**7-3**]): Patient appears to be in a-fib with V
paced rhytm with occasional PVCs, rare ventricular couplets, no
VT.
.
4)PFTs ([**7-6**]): FEV1 markedly reduced. FEV1/FVC ratio is normal.
No improvement with bronchodilators. Severe restrictive and
obstructive lung defect.
.
5)ECHO ([**7-4**]): Diffuse cardiomyopathy. EF~ 10-15%. Moderate
RA/RV chamber size abnormality. No pericardial effusion. Severe
mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Mild to
moderate aortic imcompetence.
.
6)RUQ U/S ([**7-4**]): No acute abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 6105**] is a 79yo male with PMH as listed above who
presents with odontoid fracture and hypotension. His admission
was complicated by MRSA parotitis and MRSA bacteremia. He failed
evaluation by speech and swallow secondary to aspiration. The
patient made it clear to family and the medical team that he did
not want any "tubes" or to be kept alive by a machine. He had an
episode on [**2114-7-18**] when he desaturated to the low 80's with SBP
in the 70s. He declined intubation and transfer to the MICU. His
goals of care were advanced to CMO. Below is a brief summary of
his hospital course by problem.
.
1)Hypotension: The patient was found to be hypotensive with
SBPs~80 in ED. He was given 3L of NS and BP now in 90's. Per
PCP's office and OSH records, baseline SBP is 80-90's. Of note,
he was recently admitted to OSH with hypotension and dizziness.
He had multiple imaging tests as described above, none of which
were very revealing. Despite this, there was concern for
possible underlying infection given his leukocytosis with WBC
elevated to 25. He was found to have parotitis with cultures
positive for MRSA. He also had [**11-23**] positive blood cultures for
MRSA.
.
#) MRSA bacteremia/parotitis: As above. He was started on
vancomycin. He received 1mg IV vancomycin x 2 on [**7-17**] due to
communication errors (dose should have been x1) and his dose was
elevated on [**7-18**] to 150. Given his depressed renal function and
decreased ability to clear the vancomycin, he will likely have
the antibiotic in his system at a supra/therapeutic level for
several days. His vancomycin level on discharge was 18.3. To
receive one dose tonight ([**7-20**]) and one final dose on [**2114-7-23**].
.
2)Odontoid fracture: Patient found to have odontoid fracture as
a result of a mechanical fall. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] (ortho-spine) who
did not feel that the patient is candidate for halo given his
age and morbidity associated with this procedure. Therefore, it
was decided to treat conservatively with cervical collar. When
goals of care were changed to CMO, the patient requested to have
the collar removed. He is fully aware of the potential risks
associated with this.
.
3)Bilateral pleural effusions: Patient has history of bilateral
pleural effusions since [**10-25**] as per OSH records. He presented
on this admission with predominantly R sided effusion, which is
likely loculated on his CXR. He admits to productive cough over
past few weeks but denies any fevers, chills, or other systemic
symptoms.  It was thought most likely secondary to CHF and no
further work-up was pursued.
.
4)Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient is known to have renal
insufficiency, thought to be secondary to tubulointerstitial
nephritis and longstanding hypertension. Per OSH reports, he is
refusing dialysis. He confirmed his decision on admission.
.
5)Hyponatremia/Hypernatremia: He presented with Na~131 on
admission. Baseline Na per OSH records is in mid-high 130's.
Patient appeared volume overloaded on physical exam, and his
hyponatremia was thought most likely secondary to underlying
CHF. Could also be abnormal in light of CRI. Over the course of
admission, the patient became hypernatremic, likely secondary to
volume depletion due to decreased PO intake. He was repleted
gently with IVF given his low EF and Na was slowly trending back
down.
.
6)Anion gap metabolic acidosis: He also presented with an
elevated anion gap of 17. Uremia is the most likely cause given
elevated creatinine. He had a normal lactate.
.
7)CHF: Patient known to have dilated cardiomyopathy. Recent echo
reveals EF~10-15%. He is on diuretics as outpatient. There is
also evidence of volume overload which is suggested by bilateral
LE edema. His recent
