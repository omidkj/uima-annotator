History of Present Illness:
INITIAL HX PRIOR TO ICU ADMISSION:
This is a 70 yo F w/ h/o relapsing papillary serous ovarian
cancer last first diagnosed in [**2117**].  She was last admitted to
this hospital for her 7th cycle of cisplatin.  She was given
[**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol once in [**2117**], and was changed to [**Doctor Last Name **]-cytoxan for
low counts in 01/[**2118**].  She tne received six cycles of cisplatin
started in [**1-/2125**] and administered in the hospital because of
the questionable history of allergic reaction to carboplatin.
-
Since that admission, she showed signs of fluid retention, both
in her legs and in her ascites but she did not have any evidence
of congestive heart failure based on exam with normal lungs and
flat JVD. There was concern that perhaps her cancer was
progressing and that is the reason for her tense ascites, but
consideration was also given to worsening renal failure as
explanation for increased ascites.  CT scan taken [**2125-9-21**] showed increased ascites, but otherwise stable exam with
mesenteric masses and evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis that
appear unchanged when compared to [**2125-7-25**].
-
Her husband reported some recent confusion during their clinic
visit on [**9-26**].  Due to her creatinine clearance of about
20mL/min, the decision was made during this visit to switch the
patient to weekly gemzar despite the stability of dz achieved
w/cisplatin.  Due to her decreased creatinine clearance, a
reduced dose of 500 mg per meters squared was chosen.  She was
started on this dose on [**10-3**] and acutely tolerated it well.  The
plan was for weekly gemzar, three weeks on and one week off.
-
The patient first felt different from her normal self on
Saturday, when she "started to feel lousy."  She saw an
accupuncturist on Sat. for posterior neck pain; needles were
inserted into her head, back and ankles.  On Sunday, her
weakness progressed to the point that she could no longer stand.
 Her husband noted a bloodshot left eye ealier today, now
resolved.  She recently fell on her left buttock.
-
On ROS, the patient notes moderate to severe abdominal pain for
the past several days, especially before meals and sometimes
resolved with food.  She sleeps with three pillows.
-
Today, the patient's fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] her.  She reported the
above symptoms and was told to come to clinic.  Her hematocrit
has decreased from 33 to 17 and so she was admitted to omed and
immediately transferred to ICU as INR>60.

ON TRANSFER BACK TO OMED FROM ICU:

Mrs. [**Known lastname 1661**] is a 70 y/o F with recurrent ovarian CA, s/p CABG,
s/p MV repair, and hypothyroid, presented from onc clinic on
[**2125-10-8**] with weakness, nausea, and decreased PO intake since
gemcitabine tx on [**2125-10-3**] and on clinic visit [**10-8**] was found to
be hyptotensive, decrease hct (from 33.0 to 17.1), and INR>60.
Patient was initially admitted to OMED service, but transferred
to MICU for further evaluation. Please see MICU Admit note for
more information on past medical hx and course during stay. In
brief, patient was admitted for hemodynamic stability and work
up of coagulopathic state. Mrs. [**Known lastname 1661**] denied diarrhea,
hematuria but did report very slight BRBPR on toilet paper. She
was trace guiac positive on admission. She had diffuse
ecchymosis over lower extremities, back, and buttocks. She
received 6 units of PRBC's with appropriate bump in hct to 34.1
on [**10-16**].  In terms of her coagulopathy, it is thought that a
combination of coumadin (for h/o DVT), decrease PO intake, and
recent administration of gemcitabine were instigating factors.
Coumadin held on admission. She received 1 unit FFP and was
initially treated with PO vitamin K while in MICU, with decrease
in INR to 3.0 on morning of [**10-17**]. On [**10-17**] she received 1 mg IV
vitamin K. Her initial mixing studies were negative for
inhibitors. Shortly after receiving the 6 units of blood,
patient became SOB secondary to fluid overloaded state. She was
diuresed and responded well to lasix; however, creatinine began
rising (above baseline of ~2.6) likely because of hypovolumia
and decrease blood flow to kidneys. Patient was subsequently
gently hydrated, with impoved renal status.  Creatinine 2.8 on
[**10-16**]. During fluid overloaded state, Mrs. [**Known lastname 1661**] also developed
AFib, which per family was new onset. After cardiology consult
and discussion with primary oncology team, it was decided to
cardiovert patient. She tolerated well and is now in NSR.
Nutrition is still an issue for patient, as she has decrease
appetite. Also, she was seen by PT for gait instability/[**Month (only) **]
balance. Mrs [**Known lastname 1661**] appears well and states that she is feeling
good. She is anxious to get up and walk around the floor.
Patient currently denies and n/v/dizziness. No f/c/ns/sob/cp.
She has not urinated since foley d/c'ed this morning but feels
that she might be able to go soon. Urinary retention was not a
problem for her prior to admission.

carboplatin times four from [**6-/2119**] to 09/[**2119**].

mouth sores in 11/[**2123**].
Status post carboplatin times two, discontinued because of an
allergic reaction that occurred in 12/[**2123**].
Status post cisplatin times three from [**1-/2124**] to [**4-/2124**],
discontinued because of rising creatinine.
Status post weekly Taxol but discontinued because of disease
progression.
Started on cisplatin 50 mg/m2 in [**9-/2124**] status post two cycles
at that time, discontinued because of rising creatinine.
Status post two cycles with Navelbine, discontinued because of
