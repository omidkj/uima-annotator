Pertinent Results:
[**2195-12-20**] CTA torso:
1. Type B aortic dissection originating just distal to the left
subclavian
artery extending into the left common iliac artery, is unchanged
in extent and appearance from [**2195-12-19**] exam. There is no
evidence of bowel ischemia at this time.
2. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion measuring up to 37
Hounsfield
units in attenuation, likely hemorrhagic, appears new since
prior exam.

[**2195-12-22**] CTA torso:
1. Stable type B aortic dissection with chronic ischemia of the
lower pole of the left kidney. Mesenteric vessels appear patent.
The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] arises off the false lumen but contrast is present
within this vessel which may due to retrograde flow.
2. Increased left and right pleural effusion with possible early
developing pneumonia in the left lung.
3. Possible enlarged right Bartholin gland cysts, correlate
clinically.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. IVC clamp with resulting subcutaneous collateral vessels.

[**2195-12-21**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. A dissection flap is suggested
in the abdominal aorta. No definite dissection flap is seen in
the ascending aorta or arch (best excluded to MRI, CT, or TEE).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Minimal
aortic stenosis. Abdominal aortic dissection. Increased PCWP.

LABS:

INR [**2195-12-26**] 1.3

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on
[**2195-12-19**] with a type B aortic dissection noted on CT scan at
[**Location (un) 8641**].  Upon arrival she had a dedicated CT-A of the torso
which confirmed the type B dissection from the distal aortic
arch to the iliac bifurcation.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]
CVICU for close monitoring and aggressive blood pressure
control.  A cardiac surgery consultation was obtained, and
medical management was agreed upon between both surgical teams.
On [**2195-12-23**] she was transferred to the general floor.

A summary of her hospital course by systems is as follows:

Neuro: Ms. [**Known lastname **] did complain of chest / back pain during the
hospital course and ibuprofen and ultram were added PRN to her
usual home dose of vicodin. Pain control was improved at the
time of discharge.  Notably Ms. [**Known lastname **] did become confused and
agitated overnight [**12-26**], which was self-limited and improved
after sleep.

Resp: She remained stable on room air during this
hospitalization and is discharged in good condition from a
pulmonary standpoint.

CV: A cardiac surgery consult was obtained for this aortic
dissection, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] agreed with the plan for blood
pressure management and no surgical intervention at this time.
She was initially maintained on labetolol and nicardipine drips
in the CVICU, with SBPs <120, and she was eventually weaned off
of drips and transitioned to her home regimen with increased
doses of metoprolol and digoxin as well as her usual dose of
lisinopril and verapamil.  A repeat CT-A was obtained on [**12-22**]
due to increasing pain which demonstrated a stable appearance of
the dissection, and her pain resolved.

GI: She was found to be constipated on admission, likely related
to her chronic narcotic use at home.  Abdominal imaging revealed
copious stool throughout the colon.  She was started on a bowel
regimen including colace, senna, and miralax with PRN milk of
magnesia and dulcolax.  At time of discharge she was moving her
bowels regularly and tolerating a regular diet.

GU: A foley catheter was placed at the time of admission and
attempted to be discontinued twice, however both times Ms. [**Known lastname **]
failed a voiding trial and the catheter was replaced.  A UA on
[**12-26**] demonstrated moderate WBCs and bacteria; culture pending.
CT-A did note dissection into the left renal artery with small
left lower renal infarct, with no intervention warranted for
this.

Heme: Initially her home coumadin was held due to concern of
propagation of the dissection; it was resumed on [**12-25**] at a dose
of 5mg and transitioned to her home dose on [**12-26**].

ID: She remained afebrile and WBC was stable throughout the
hospitalization. On [**12-26**] she was noted to have malodorous urine
and a UA was positive for WBCs, nitrites and bacteria. While
cultures were pending she became confused overnight [**12-26**] and a
3-day course of ciprofloxacin was started for empiric treatment
of UTI.

Dispo: Physical therapy deemed Ms. [**Known lastname **] safe to be disharged to
home with VNA services and family support.  Appropriate f/u was
scheduled for Ms. [**Known lastname **] and provided at time of discharge.
