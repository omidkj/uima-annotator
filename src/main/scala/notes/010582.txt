weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 yo man with metastatic rectal CA to brain
s/p WBR with recurrent seizures brought in by family after he
failed to consume food or take medications in the days leading
up to admission. History attained through patient's wife.
According to patient's wife, the patient was eating, drinking,
and taking his medications consistently as recently as 3 days
ago. He began to eat progressively less over the course of
subsequent days. On the day of admission, the patient refused to
eat at all or take any of his medications. Concerned, the
patient's family brought him to the ED. The patient denies any
cough, sputum production, SOB, CP, N/V/D, fevers or chills. When
asked why he did not consume food over the last few days, the
patient replies "I was not hungry."
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 55796**].
During that admission, the patient presented after seizures at
home. Neuro-oncology was consulted and levetiracetam dose was
increased and dexamethasone was restarted. Palliative care and
hospice were consulted, but Mr. [**Known lastname 14502**] decided not to enroll in
hospice care at that time. At a recent outpatient oncology
appointment, discussion revolved around attaining more help at
home and enrolling in a hospice program.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 97.3 174 125/78 18 100%RA. Labs
were significant for lactate 3.2 and WBC 2.1. He was febrile to
100.8 during his ED course. Head CT (obtained to r/o ICH) showed
stable R frontal and L temporal mets with edema and bony
involvement, but without significant change since [**2144-10-5**]. CXR showed ? bilateral infrahilar opacities concerning for
evaloving infection. He was given vancomycin and cefepime. The
patient has two large bore IVs for access. Vitals at the time of
transfer: 114/51 110 10 97%2L. He received close to 3L IVF in
the ED.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient states he feels tired. He has
no other concerns at this time.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
# Early stage lung cancer s/p right upper lobectomy and

recurrence.
# Rectal cancer: T3N2M0; dx 10/[**2140**].

showed poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- [**3-/2142**]: Low anterior resection and diverting loop ileostomy
and mesenteric and periaortic lymphadenectomy (T3N2M0, [**8-17**]

bone metsmetastasis.

and dehydration. CT demonstrated small bowel thickening
suggestive of enteritis. Cultures negative.
- [**2142-7-16**]: C3 FLOX.
- [**8-8**] - [**2142-8-12**]: Hospitalized for weakness, abdominal pain, and
increased ostomy output and dehydration. CT revealed epiploic
appendagitis.
- [**2142-8-21**]: C4 FLOX (dose reduced 5-FU 400 mg/m2 D1,15 +
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 D1,15).
- [**2142-9-18**]: C5 FLOX.
- [**2142-10-16**]: C6 FLOX.  Therapy was complicated by
oxaliplatin-related neuropathy involving the palms, feet and
distal calves.
- [**2143-7-24**] - [**2143-12-4**]: 7 cycles of single-[**Doctor Last Name 360**] irinotecan
350mg/m2 q21d.
- [**2143-10-9**]: CT TORSO showed increased sclerotic bony metastatic
disease unclear if due to disease progression or response to
treatment.
- [**2144-1-22**] - [**2144-4-15**]: Irinotecan + cetuximab.
- [**5-/2144**]: Restarted capecitabine.
- [**5-/2144**]: T1 cord compression, s/p C7 bilateral hemilaminotomy,
T1 laminectomy for removal biopsy tumor neoplasm, T2 bilateral
hemilaminotomy, posterolateral fusion C7-T1, posterolateral
thoracic fusion T1-T2, and XRT to C5-T5 and T6-L4.
- [**8-/2144**]: New seizure, brain mets on CT and MRI.
- [**2144-9-8**]: Completed whole brain XRT 3000 cGy in 10 fractions.

Imaging
CT Head w/o Contrast ([**2144-11-9**]): Overall unchanged right frontal
and left temporal lobe hyperdense metastases with extensive
surrounding edema and bony involvement, overall extent,
unchanged since [**2144-10-5**]. No new intracranial hemorrhage
or increased mass effect. Further workup as clinically
indicated.

CXR ([**2144-11-9**]): Extent and distribution of rib-based metastases
appear overall unchanged since [**Month (only) 359**]. Subtle increase in
opacity of R lung base since [**Month (only) 359**] which may represent
evolving infection. Similar opacity in L infrahilar region. No
vascular congestion. Interval development of b/l infrahilar
opacities raising ? of evolving infection.

Lower extremity venous ultrasound ([**2144-11-9**])- No evidence of DVT
in right or left lower extremity.

CTA Chest ([**2144-11-9**])- 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism within
the main, lobar, and segmental branches. Assessment of
subsegmental arteries is limited due to motion artifacts and
multifocal lung opacities.
2. Multifocal pneumonia with a likely component of superimposed
pulmonary
edema.
3. Moderate diffuse emphysema
4. Bilateral mild pleural effusions.
5. Multifocal osseous metastases, progressed since [**2144-6-1**].

EKG: AFib with rate 156


Brief Hospital Course:
71 year-old man with metastatic rectal CA with brain mets
reulting in seizures presenting with tachycardia, fever, and CT
findings consistent with multifocal PNA. He was transferred to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit initially for hypotension and
stabalized. Given the progressive nature of his underlying
malignancy, family meetings were held and the decision was made
for the patient to be DNR/DNI. He was subsequently transferred
back to the oncology service, but never regained conciousness.
He was made [**Hospital Ward Name 3225**] (comfort measures only) after further
discussions with his wife and health care proxy. Extended family
gathered at the patient's bedside and he died without pain on
[**2144-11-13**].

sepsis due to
