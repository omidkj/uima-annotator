Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year old female with PMH of recent CVA of the
posterior limb of the internal capsule, esophageal stricture s/p
multiple dilatations most recently on [**12-4**], non-healing peptic
ulcer disease s/p subtotal gastrectomy and repair of hiatal
hernia with fundoplication in [**2163-8-19**], COPD, Depression,
and PTSD presenting from [**Hospital 1820**] Rehab Center with persistent
nausea and vomiting as well as reported hypotension to a
systolic in the 80s.  The patient was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-30**] for persistent nausea and vomiting with inability
to take POs.   She notes that she usually does have baseline
nausea and vomiting at home, which is helped by a diet
recommended to her by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] but she has been unable to
stick to that diet at rehab.  She is unable to quantify the
amount of vomiting she has been having over the last few days.
She describes the vomiting as continuous, but she has not had
any vomiting since arriving to the hospital.  She also describes
abdominal pain in her right lower quadrant which is chronic in
nature.  She has not had any fevers, chills, hematemesis or
change in bowel habits.  Her esophagus was recently dilated on
[**12-4**] and she has not had any dysphagia or odynophagia since.
Her Plavix which is being used for secondary prevention of CVA
was stopped for the EGD procedure and has not yet been
restarted.  She also reports lightheadedness and weakness in
association with these symptoms.  Of note, she was being treated
at her rehab with cipro for a known UTI.
     In the ED, initial vitals were T=98.2, HR=110, BP=104/75,
RR=18, POx=98% 2L NC.  Reported vitals at her rehab prior to
transfer were HR=110s, BP=84/62, 88% on RA.  A UA performed on
admission was positive for infection and she was given
vancomycin and ertapenem in the ED.  A CT of her abdomen was
unremarkable/unchanged from her baseline and her CXR did not
show any signs of infection.  She also had [**9-27**] LLQ abdominal
pain in the ED with no CVA tenderness noted.  She did reportedly
desaturate to 89% when tried on RA in the ED.  She was also
noted to be persistently hypotensive to the 80s which did
respond to 2.5L of IVF boluses in the ED.  Prior to transfer,
her vitals were BP=96/67, HR=105, RR=18, POx=94% 2L.
     On the floor, the patient reports that she continues to be
nauseous which is no different than her baseline when she does
not adhere to her recommended diet.  She reports that her
abdominal pain is at baseline in her right lower quadrant.  She
does feel as though her bowels are constantly moving in her
abdomen.  She denies any dysuria.  She says that she feels close
to her baseline.

IMAGING:
[**12-16**] CT abd/pelvis- Prelim read: Gastrojejunostomy anastomosis
appears patent with a small lumen. It is difficult to assess for
lumen distensibility or lumen diameter on this study. If
clinically indicated, upper GI study would better evaluate this
anatomosis. Debris is visualized in the stomach, although it is
unknown when the patient last ate.
.
[**12-16**] CXR: Hilar fullness noted bilaterally with scattered
vascular markings in bilateral lung fields, but no acute process
or infiltrate noted.
.
[**12-17**] CXR: FINDINGS: The apparent opacity projected over the
left lower lobe, is less dense on the current radiograph and
when correlated with lateral views, is consistent with
mediastinal fat rather than a parenchymal abnormality. The
lungs, cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia


Brief Hospital Course:
#. UTI.  The patient was found to have a positive UA on
admission and was being treated with a 7 day course of cipro at
her rehab facility for a known UTI, but was unclear how far she
was into her course.  She was hypotensive on admission which was
fluid responsive and also tachycardic and hypoxic with a normal
lactate.  Her vital sign changes were concerning for early
sepsis prompting her admission to the unit.  She was given
vancomycin and ertapenem in the ED given her multiple allergies.
 Her most recent urine cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] showed gram positive
bacteria and pansensitive Klebsiella.  The patient was continued
on vancom
