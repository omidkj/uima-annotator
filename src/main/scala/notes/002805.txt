CXR ([**2151-1-3**]):
1. Bibasilar airspace opacities, right worse than left,
concerning for
multifocal pneumonia.
2. Probable mild pulmonary edema.
.
CXR ([**2151-1-3**], s/p line placement):
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has
been
placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the lower
portion of the SVC. Again, there is evidence of elevated
pulmonary venous pressure with more focal area of opacification
in the right mid and lower lung zones, concerning for pneumonia.

.
Interval Results:
.
CT Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis ([**2151-1-4**]):
1. Multifocal consolidation, worse in the right middle and lower
lobes,
concerning for multifocal pneumonia. No evidence of interstitial
or alveolar edema.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small
on the left.
3. Lymphadenopathy, particularly in the left retroperitoneum and
mediastinum, which may relate to the patient's HIV disease.
.
Right Ankle XR ([**2151-1-4**]):
No evidence of acute fracture.
.
TTE ([**2151-1-5**]):
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal Doppler signal
at the right and left ventricular apices, throughout the cardiac
cycle (cine loops 36, 37, 54, 55). Although a Doppler artifact
is possible, this may also represent a congenital coronary
artery-to-ventricular fistula. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Mildly dilated
right ventricle with normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Possible coronary artery-to-ventricular
fistula.

PENDING DATA:

[**1-9**] Stool AFB cultures x 1 pending
[**1-8**] Bone Marrow Bx pathology, cytogenetics, cultures - pending

.
CXR [**2151-1-12**]: There is marked interval improvement in the degree
of opacity in the right lung and bilateral upper lobe venous
diversion, which likely represented right lower lobe pneumonia
with associated
pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear
normal.
