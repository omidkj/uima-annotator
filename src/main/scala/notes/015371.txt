History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 42915**] is a pleasant woman with CAD s/p stents to theOM1
and RCA (now occluded) with SVG-RCA in [**2164**] (also occluded). She
presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42916**] in [**Month (only) 1096**] with c/o angina every
other night. At that time she preferred medical management and
was started on a NTPatch, her Atenolol was decreased from 50mg
to 25mg because of fatigue. The CP decreased in frequency and
she has only needed the NTG three or four times since starting
on the  patch. She was scheduled for a stress test [**2-5**]
which showed a predominantly fixed inferior posterior defect and
an EF of 70%. She was therefore referred for cardiac
catheterization and admitted on [**2172-3-4**] for elective PCI.

Brief Hospital Course:
Her cardiac catheterization was complicated by dissection of the
obtuse marginal branch. She developed chest pain for which an
IABP was placed.  With repeat percutaneous dilation and
placement of IABP, her chest pain improved. Given the tortuosity
of her vessel, a stent could not be placed. Cardiac surgery was
urgently consulted for surgical revascularization. In
anticipation of CABG, Integrilin was discontinued.

On [**3-4**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed urgent redo coronary
artery bypass grafting. Surgery was uneventful, for further
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, she was brought to the CSRU. Within 24 hours, she
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She maintained
stable hemodynamics and gradually weaned from inotropic support.
She was fluid overloaded and initially required aggressive
diuresis. On postoperative day five, she developed acute
respiratory distress following removal of central venous line.
She went into rapid atrial fibrillation at that time, and was
concomitantly noted to have left sided weakness/hemiparesis. She
never lost blood pressure or pulse but required reintubation.
Bedside TEE was notable for no large air collections or thrombi.
A small left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum was
seen. A small secundum atrial septal defect was present. Given
concern for stroke, the neurology service was consulted and head
CT scan was obtained. The CT scan showed no acute intracranial
abnormality, with no specific evidence of early territorial
infarction. Small chronic lacunar infarcts were noted. Selective
angiogram of right internal carotid artery found no vascular
occlusion or major stenosis. TPA was therefore not administered.
Atrial fibrillation was treated with beta blockade and
Amiodarone. She quickly converted back to a normal sinus rhythm.
Pheneylephrine was initially started to maintain systolic blood
pressures. Within 24 hours of the respiratory/neurologic event,
she was re-extubated. She gradually weaned from pressor support.
Over several days, her left sided weakness improved. She worked
with PT/OT. She remained stable on medical therapy and
transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day eight.
She continued to progress and was cleared for discharge.  On
[**3-14**], day of discharge, she was noted to have small amount of
erythema on her R leg vein harvest sight.  She was started
empirically on levaquin and was discharged to rehab.
