History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 53 year old woman with T1-T2 paraplegia s/p
MVC, recurrent UTI/PNA (recently d/ced for PNA on [**2149-11-17**],
treated for UTI [**2149-12-3**]), chronically on 2L of oxygen at home
for COPD who presents with SOB, productive cough and increased
home O2 requirement. One day prior to admission, pt started to
experience increased secretions with cough and sob. Her VNA came
over and symptoms progressed with desats to 80s. Used nebs x3
and sats did not improve. Increased O2 to 4L and sats improved
only to 90-91. Pt denies fevers, but reports chills. She reports
aspirating some of her breakfast in the AM.
.
She was recently admitted [**11-10**] to [**2149-11-17**] and finished a two
week course of vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] for PNA and a UTI. [**12-3**] she was
diagnosed with a proteus UTI by her PCP and got 10 days of
cefpodoxime.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was tachypneic to 22-23, BP96/58 O2 sat 89% on 4L
NC with rectal temp of 102. Labs notable for WBC 13.5, Hct 31.1.
UA large leuks, negative nitrite and few bacteria. Lactate was
1.7 Patient was given Tylenol, albuterol/ipratropium nebs,
vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/Flagyl and 1L NS. Has port in place b/c of recurrent
admissions. Of note, pt also requires straight catheterization
at home due to urinary retention.
.
Pt was initially admitted to the MICU and started on vanc,
cefepime, flagyl and tobramycin. Pt's O2 sats improved and she
remained afebrile. At time of transfer to floor she was afebrile
sating well on 2L.
.
She denies any changes in urine frequency or color, no dysuria,
no myalgias, no chest pain or palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old woman w/ T1-T2 paraplegia s/p MVC, recurrent
UTI/PNA, COPD on 2L home O2 who presents with worsening SOB and
wheezing.
.
#. HCAP: Initial CXR appeared similar to CXR from prior
admission for pna.  Pt reports that she believes that she
aspirated some of her food on the morning of admission.  She
then spiked a fever in the ED and had worsening SOB.  The time
course for aspiration event would favor chemical pneumonitis
because development of aspiration pna is days, not hours.
However, pt does appear to have PNA on CXR and was recently
hospitalized for PNA so she was initiated on broad spectrum
antibiotics for HCAP.  In the ICU she was started on
vanc/cefepime/tobramycin/flagyl.  Her O2 requirement improved to
her baseline of 2L and she was transferred to the floor.  On the
floor, pt remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  She
continued to saturate in high 90s on 2L O2.  Flagyl and
tobramycin were d/ced on the floor, and sputum ultimately grew
staph, so cefepime was d/ced as well.  She remained afebrile and
at baseline O2 requirement for 24hrs.  Pt was discharged with an
additional 6 days of vancomycin for ten day course.
.
COPD: Pt was continued on all of her home inhalers and given
standing and PRN nebs.  By the time she was transferred to the
floor she was sating well on home dose of o2 (2L).  On
discharge, no medication changes were made.
.
Hypothyroidism: Pt was continued on home synthroid
.
Hep C: stable, recent LFTs within normal limits.  No treatment
was initiated during this hospitalization.
.

- will need additional 6 days of IV abx
