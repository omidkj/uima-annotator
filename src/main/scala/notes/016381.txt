History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a PMH of ESRD secondary
to DM, on HD who was in her usual state of health until she
presented at HD with altered mental status and hypotension. She
initiated HD about 2 weeks ago, dialyzing M,W,F. She was then
sent to the OSH ED for evaulation of her hypotension. At the
[**Hospital6 **] she was found to have a WBC of 41.7
with 94 segmented neutrophils. Her labs were also notable for a
HCT of 29.4. Also of note, she had an alk phos of 1023. At the
OSH ED, she received 2 L NS, 3.375 mg zosyn, and 1 gm vancomycin
after blood and urine cultures were sent. She was started on
dopamine for a blood pressure of 53/45. Arrangements were made
for transfer to our ED.
The patient notes that she has not taken her medications for two
days because she ran out of some of them. She also states that
she is in chronic stable back and abdominal pain. The pain
starts in the right flank and radiates to the right UQ and
axilla. MRCP done to evaluate this was negative for stones but a
biopsy of the liver showed mucinous adenocarcinoma on [**2182-9-12**].

RUQ: 1. Diffusely enlarged liver with multiple masses consistent
with tumor.
2. Decompressed gallbladder with wall thickening.
3. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Further evaluation with MRCP
or ERCP is recommended.
...............

[**2182-10-9**]
CXR
IMPRESSION: Small right effusion with associated atelectasis. If
there is a persistent concern for pneumonia and lateral view
would be recommended to fully exclude right lower lobe pneumonia
...........
[**2182-10-10**]
ECHO
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is
a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
.............
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2182-10-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large, diffuse infiltrating mass within the right lobe of the
liver with possible peritoneal carcinomatosis. Enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes, left adrenal mass and multiple lung
nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
2. Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation, likely from the obstructing
tumor.
............
[**2182-10-11**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Right axis deviation. There is a late
transition with
anterior and anterolateral and lateral ST-T wave changes
consistent with
possible right ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2182-10-9**] right axis deviation is new and the ST-T wave
changes are
more prominent.
..................
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
1. Large, diffuse infiltrating mass within the right lobe of the
liver with
possible peritoneal carcinomatosis. Enlarged retroperitoneal
lymph nodes,
left adrenal mass and multiple lung nodules consistent with
metastatic
disease. A contrast-enhanced study is recommended. If renal
function
precludes this, consider MRI.
2. Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation, likely from the obstructing
tumor.





Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 66 y.o. with ESRD on HD with markedly elevated WBC and
hypotension of unclear etiology.
.
# hypotension: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented with persistent hypotension
of unclear source. She was not previuosly dialyzed.  Sepsis was
considered from HD line or intraabdominal process. Pancytopenia
in presence of leukocytosis concerning for hematologic
malignancy. She had daily blood cultures, none of which grew
anything by the time of this summary. Cultures from the OSH did
not grow anything. Her diltiazem was held. She required 2
pressors, and was still somewhat hypotensive. She was treated
with vanco, levo, flagyl for a possible line infection. Renal
was consulted and it was decided not to pull her HD line in case
she needed dialysis. CT of the abdomen showed a large mass in
the right lobe of her liver, with possible peritoneal and lymph
node involvement. Over the course of her short stay her blood
pressure remained low. He son [**Name (NI) **] was consulted and she was
made DNR/DNI. He flew up from [**State **] to see her and to talk
with his family about CMO. Shortly after his arrival Mrs. [**Known lastname **]
died of cardiac arrest.
.
# leukocytosis: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had an elevated WBC count of unclear
source. As discussed above all cultures were negative, and she
received empiric antibiotic treatment with vanc, levo, flagyl. A
TTE evaluation for vegetations (she had a murmur) was negative.
Hematology/oncology was consulted, and felt that she had
incurable disease with a grim prognosis. In her condition on
admission there was no possible treatment option. This was
discussed with her son [**Name (NI) **], and contributed to his decision to
make her DNR/DNI.
.
# ESRD: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had been on HD for the last 2 weeks prior to
admission. There was no indication for acute HD although she
missed a few dialysis appointments. However, her HD line was
left in place in case she did need HD during her stay. Given her
clinical deterioration though, she was not dialysed.
.
#Coagulopathy - Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an elevated PTT and PT which was
thought to possible be due to liver disease, or her large tumor
burden. DIC panel was negative.
.
# DM: Mrs.[**Known lastname 99593**] sugars were controlled with a RISS.
.
# hepatic mucinous adenocarcinoma: Hematology/oncology was
consulted, and felt that she had incurable disease with a grim
prognosis. In her condition on admission there was no possible
treatment option. LFTs were followed and were elevated
throughout, particularly AST and Alk Phos.
