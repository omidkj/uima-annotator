Admission Date:  [**2115-1-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-1-23**]


Service:  MEDICAL ICU/[**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year-old
white male with a history of large left sided lung mass who
recently had a biopsy who presented with mental status
changes and vomiting followed by hypoxemia.  He had a biopsy
of his lung mass on [**2115-1-18**].  On the day prior to
admission the patient complained of pain at his biopsy site,
which is controlled with Percocet.  On the morning of
admission he developed a fever to 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit
rectally.  His O2 sats were 90% on 2.5 liters nasal cannula.
A chest x-ray revealed left upper lobe and right lower lobe
infiltrates and the patient was started on Levofloxacin for
presumed pneumonia.  Later that day he gradually became more
lethargic and required more pain medication.  After the one
episode of vomiting the patient's O2 sats fell to the 80s on
2.5 liters per minute nasal cannula and he was 92% on 8
liters of nasal cannula.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.  On
arrival the patient required 100% nonrebreather face mask to
keep his O2 sats in the high to mid 90s.  A chest x-ray
revealed left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with an
additional infiltrate around the mass and a moderate sized
left pleural effusion.  He was given a dose of Levofloxacin
and Flagyl in the Emergency Department.  Arterial blood gas
on a nonrebreather mask revealed pH at 7.2 on oxygen, CO2 of
80 and oxygen of 125.  A trial of BIPAP was attempted,
however, the patient could not tolerate the mask.  He was
then placed back on a nonrebreather with almost identical
arterial blood gas of 7.20, 79, and 125.  The MICU team was
then called to evaluate the patient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 liters nasal
cannula at home.  Pulmonary function tests in [**2107**] showed an
FEV of 0.62, FVC of 1.3 and FEV/FVC of 45%.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease status post right femoral
popliteal bypass graft.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and myocardial infarction.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Type 2 diabetes.
6.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral
resection of the prostate.
7.  Depression.
8.  Essential tremor.
9.  Bladder cancer.
10.  Benign positional vertigo.
11.  Lung cancer metastatic to the liver.  Recent biopsy
performed with biopsy results pending.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Heparin, Tylenol #3, aspirin,
Lactulose, Fluoxetine, Isosorbide mononitrate, Imdur,
Lisinopril, Fluticasone, Atrovent, Albuterol, Senna and
Colace.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
complicated by his continued respiratory distress.  The
patient continued to request no invasive measures including
no intubation, no resuscitation and no chest tube placement.
Essentially the patient wanted to die peacefully and not have
any invasive measures done to sustain his life.  At that
point the patient was transferred to the MICU to the medical
floor.  He continued to have respiratory decline and was
eventually unresponsive and made comfort measures only by his
family whose daughter [**Name (NI) 4051**] [**Name (NI) 6203**] who is his health care
proxy.  The patient passed on [**2115-1-23**] at around
5:00 p.m.  He died of respiratory failure secondary to lung
cancer secondary to pneumonia.  The patient's family declined
a post mortem examination.
