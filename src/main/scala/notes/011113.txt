2. Application of allograft.
3. Application of morselized autograft.
4. Posterior cervical arthrodesis C2-C7.

History of Present Illness:
78 yo M with CAD, ESRD, HTN, HL, DM and dCHF, presenting to the
ED after a fall at home. He was trying to grab his grandson near
the bed and fell out of bed, hitting his face on the dresser. On
arrival to the ED, he was found to multiple facial fractures and
an exam concerning for central cord compression.
On [**2109-10-16**] underwent an MRI which showed severe spinal canal
stenosis, similar to the prior examination, with developing
increase in spinal cord abnormal signal at C4-C5, which may
reflect cord edema or myelomalacia. Prior to his surgery, CCU
was consulted for advice regarding evaluation and management of
emergent need for surgery in the setting of multiple cardiac
risk factors, and indicated that no further cardiac testing
needed prior to surgery, and to resume plavix when safe
post-surgery. As such, HMFP Ortho Spine operated on [**10-18**],
performing a posterior cervical arthrodesis C2-C7, bilateral
laminotomy C3 with medial facetectomy, and bilateral laminectomy
and medial facetectomy of C4, C5, C6, C7. A CT of his head
showed comminuted nasal bone fx with air tracking in overlying
subcutaneous tissue, for which plastics was consulted, and
recommended follow-up in their clinic, as well as stitches out
on [**2109-10-22**].

Additionally, on [**2109-10-21**] Neurology was consulted for acute
onset of dysarthria on [**2109-10-19**]; an MRI showed mild small vessel
changes and no stroke or other significant FLAIR abnormality and
no significant stenoses or occlusion on MRA head and neck. They
believed he had toxic metabolic encephalopahty, but no focal
abnormalities on examination, so signed off.

Also of note, patient had a fever on [**2109-10-21**] to 101.5 and was
pan-cultured. Increased drainage from cervical incision site was
evaluated by ortho spine-thought to be appropriate.
His ICU course has also been complicated by occasional
hypertension requiring hydralazine.  Patient upon request for
transfer from ACS to Orthopedics was decline by orthopedics
secondary to concern regarding management of multiple
comorbidities. Transfer to medicine for further mangement of
multiple medical issues as well as monitoring for complications
from partial cord compression.
