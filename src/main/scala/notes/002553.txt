HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old
male with known coronary artery disease status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the left
anterior descending coronary artery in [**2130**] and [**2131**] status
post non Q wave myocardial infarction in 10/89, presented
with a two year history of increasing dyspnea on exertion,
chest pressure.  Persantine thallium was performed that
showed anterior wall ischemia.  He had a catheterization done
on [**2143-1-1**] at an outside hospital that revealed three
vessel disease with a normal EF.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, coronary artery disease status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the left
anterior descending coronary artery in [**2130**] and [**2131**].  He has
had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  He
is a former smoker.  He quit two years ago.  Bright red blood
per rectum in [**10/2142**] transfused one unit.  Had an ultimately
negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy.  He is
status post a _______ lens implant for contacts in his right
eye and has a dilated right pupil.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  [**Year (4 digits) 37612**] 2.5 500 b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is widowed and lives with his brother.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Revealed positive shortness of breath and
dyspnea on exertion.  Denies any claudication, history of
gastrointestinal bleed, history of diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6.  Pulse 76.  Blood
pressure 146/76.  O2 sat on 2 liters is 95 and 96% on room
air with 88 and in no acute distress.  Alert and oriented
times three.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  2+ radial
pulses.  Extremities warm and dry.  Abdomen was benign.
Respiratory was decreased breath sounds throughout with no
wheezes or rhonchi.  Gastrointestinal, abdomen was large,
obese with positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  His lower extremities were notable for
varicosities.  Carotids without audible bruits.  He was
edentulous.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  The patient is a 73 year-old male with
three vessel coronary artery disease who presented to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in need of coronary artery bypass grafting.  He was
therefore admitted and went to the Operating Room on [**2143-1-3**].  Preoperative laboratories were notable for a white
count of 9000, hematocrit 35, platelets 307.  Chemistries
were unremarkable.  BUN and creatinine of 18 and 1.2.  Chest
x-ray was negative except for changes consistent with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  Urinalysis was negative.  On
the [**1-3**] the patient underwent a four vessel
coronary artery bypass graft, left internal mammary coronary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal one, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal two and saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Tavaf.  He was
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.  He was
alert and oriented and extubated on the night of the
operation.  His Swan was removed.  His Lopressor and Lasix
and aspirin were started on postoperative day number one.
His diet was advanced.  He was transferred to the floor.

While on the floor the patient began aggressive physical
therapy and was noted to have high O2 requirements secondary
to poor pulmonary toilet as well as the patient's prior
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Physical therapy
worked with the patient aggressively.  He was able to get to
a level 3 or 4 by postoperative day number 3.  Postop
laboratories were notable for a hematocrit of 24 down from 35
preop.  He had BUN and creatinine of 27 and 1.4 up from 1.0.
The remainder of his electrolytes were within normal limits.
He continued incentive spirometry and his ambulatory
assistance with physical therapy as well as his diuresis.
His diuresis was, however, changed to q day Lasix instead of
the standard b.i.d. for the postoperative coronary artery
bypass graft.  The patient ultimately by postop day four the
patient's hematocrit was 24 and stable.  BUN and creatinine
were normalized to 1.2.  He was started on his [**Last Name (STitle) 37612**] and
began to have more normal glycemia since his Lopresor was
titrated to bring his heart rate down into the 70s.

On discharge his examination was noted for a temperature of
99.0, pulse 72, regular in sinus, 107/65, 22 respiratory
rate, 92% on 1 liter.  Room air sats were 90%.  He was in no
acute distress.  He had decreased breath sounds throughout.
His sternum was stable with no erythema or exudate.  He had
staples intact.  Chest tube wires were all removed.  The
patient had no drains.  The remainder of his examination was
unremarkable.  The saphenous vein harvest on the right lower
extremity was clean, dry and intact with no drainage as well.
The patient was therefore deemed appropriate and stable for
discharge to Pawtuckets near where his daughter lives.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is
a resident of [**Location **].

His follow up will include to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] one month from
the time of discharge.  He should have a wound check in one
week.
