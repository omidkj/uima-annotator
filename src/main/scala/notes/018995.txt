Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**]
Chief Complaint:
Pelvic Mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, TAH, Pelvic Lymph node dissection,
repair of left renal vein defect.
Colectomy with side to side reanastomosis Lysis of adhesions and
loop transverse colostomy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52 year old female sent by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14727**]
for consultation regarding an enlarged uterus. The patient
presented recently with postmenapausal bleeding. She was noted
to have multiple vaginal lesions on examination. Pelvic exam
revealed an enlarged uterus. An ultrasound at [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2121-4-1**] revealed a uterus measuring 13.1 cm in largest diameter.
She recently underwent examination and D&C with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14727**]
which showed multiple vaginal tumors. A biopay of two of the
vaginal lesions revealed squamous cell carcinoma.
She also mentioned that she had an attempted colonoscopy, but
this was unsuccessful due to difficulty in passing the
colonoscope.

DIAGNOSIS:

1. Uterine tumor, biopsy (A-F):

Poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive necrosis.

2. Left external ileac lymph nodes (G-J):

Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in one of six
([**12-13**]) lymph nodes.

3. Uterus and cervix, total hysterectomy (K-Q):

a. Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma extensively and
diffusely involving serosa, myometrium, lymphatic- vascular
spaces, and focally endometrial stroma (see note).



b. Inactive endometrium.

4. Lymph nodes, right external iliac (R-T):

Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in two of
eleven ([**1-18**]) lymph nodes.

5. Lymph nodes, right obturator (U-W):

Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in four of
five ([**3-12**]) lymph nodes and blood vessels.

6. Lymph nodes, right common iliac (X-Y):

Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in two of two
([**1-9**]) lymph nodes.

7. Lymph node, peri-aortic (Z):

Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in one of one
([**12-8**]) lymph node.

8. Lymph node, high peri-aortic (AA):

Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in one of one
([**12-8**]) lymph node.

9. Lymph nodes, left peri-aortic (BA-EA):

Twelve lymph nodes, no carcinoma seen (0/12).

10. Distal colon, segmental resection (FA-HA):

Segment of colon with focal endometriosis.

No carcinoma seen.

11. Sigmoid colon, segmental resection (IA-NA):

Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma involving serosa,
subserosa, muscularis propria, focally submucosa, and present
within large blood vessel.

Note: No origin of this carcinoma is identified in the uterus,
endometrium, and colon segments submitted. Immunohistochemical
stains reveal tumor cells to be positive for CK7 and CEA, with
no staining for CK20, S100, and MART1. The microscopic and
immunophenotypical features are not specific as to origin,
however favor Mullerian sites including possibly endometriosis.
Primary peritoneal, breast, and lung carcinoma are also within
the differential. Other mucosal sites are less likely, but not
definitively excluded. Additional immunostains are being
performed (ER, PR, and CDX-2) for further characterization, the
results of which will be reported in an addendum.

Sinus tachycardia, rate 117. Since the previous tracing of
[**2121-4-11**] the heart
rate is faster. Increased ST-T wave abnormalities are seen with
diminished
voltage over the mid to lateral precordium.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate for PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with metastatic endometiral CA, POD #3 from
extensive case, now with tachycardia, o2 sat 94
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 52-year-old female now postop day 3 with tachycardia
and hypoxia.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the chest
were obtained, using a low-dose technique at end expiration
without IV contrast followed by images after the administration
of 100 mL of Optiray IV contrast as a rapid bolus per the
pulmonary embolism protocol. Coronal and sagittal reformatted
images were also obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no
pathologic mediastinal, axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. The
heart and pericardium are unremarkable. There are new small
bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar
atelectasis. The previously identified 9 mm subpleural lingular
lesion is now less prominent and likely represented inflammatory
change. The previously described probable esophageal duplication
cyst is not well visualized. There has been no significant
change in right paraspinal soft tissue nodules adjacent to T4
and T5. Limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates a new
small amount of perihepatic ascites. The previously identified
hepatic lesions are better seen on CT of [**2121-4-2**] due to
differences in contrast timing.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST: There are filling defects of the
basal segmental arteries of the left lower lobe indicative of
pulmonary embolism. There is subtle mosaic perfusion at the
apices bilaterally which could be compatible with tiny emboli or
less likely hypersensitivity due to a drug reaction. The heart
opacifies well. The aorta is of normal caliber without evidence
of aneurysm or dissection.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions
are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary emboli of the left lower lobe basal segmental
arteries.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar
atelectasis.
3. No significant change in right paraspinal soft tissue nodules
along T4 and T5.
4. New small amount of perihepatic ascites.
5. Hepatic metastases better seen on CT [**2121-4-2**] due to
differences in timing of contrast.
