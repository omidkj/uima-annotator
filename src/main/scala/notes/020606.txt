Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICU monitoring

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 yo male with known Stage IV COPD with home O2
requirement and chronic prednisone, AS, and cardiac pacer, who
presents with acute shortness of breath for the past 2 days. He
states that on Sunday morning he was out in the cold weather and
also decreased his prednisone dose from 40mg to 20mg, per his
Pulmonologist. During the day he reports dyspnea on exertion,
feverishness, sore throat decreased appetite and general
malaise. He also reports cough with occasional whitish sputum.
Yesterday he noted increased DOE, as he was not able to walk up
stairs wihtout becoming acutely short of breath. He used
nebulized albuterol with minimal effect. Tmax at home was
101.7F. Recent URI treated with Augmentin, course completed.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.3 P 59 BP 142/87 R 28 O2 sat
99%/NRB. Patient was given Solu-Medrol 125mg IV, ceftriaxone 1g
IV, azithromycin 500mg IV and combivent nebs x2. The patient had
subjective improvement in his breathing, but endorsed R-sided
pleuritic CP. EKG showed AV pacing at 109bpm. CXR showed R-sided
infiltrate.
.
On the floor, he was speaking in full sentences, but remained
SOB with audible wheeze. He still complains of mild R-sided
pleuritic CP.  He denies any increase in LE edema; he has
chronic LUE edema following pacer placement. He denies any
nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, or constipation. He also denies urinary symptoms. He
did not take his PO lasix dose earlier today.

CXR [**2159-2-21**]
FINDINGS: There is a new small patchy opacity laterally in the
right mid
lung, which is suspicious for an acute early pneumonia. The
remaining lungs are clear. Scars are evident in the lower right
lung. There is mild
tortuosity of an atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac silhouette
size is
stable. There is a dual-chamber pacemaker from a standard left
subclavian
approach in stable position. No definite effusion or
pneumothorax is noted.
.
IMPRESSION: New focal patchy opacity laterally in the right mid
lung likely representing an acute pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia: Acute onset fever, cough and dyspnea in setting of
CXR infiltrate is most likely acute pneumonia - typical vs
atypical. Given ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and monitored INR,
as azithromycin has a coumadin interaction. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable, and no IVF were needed as not septic.
Was transferred to General Medicine floor on HOD 2. Cont'd on
abx with completed course of Azithromycin in house and 2 addt'l
days of Cefoxitime at d/c.  Symptomatically improved at d/c.
.
# COPD exascerbation: likely precipitated by acute pneumonia as
evidenced by marked dyspnea and wheezing and increased O2
requirement. Was given SoluMedrol 125mg q8hr x2 doses and was
transitioned to po prednisone burst (60mg -> 50mg -> 40mg ->
30mg). Weaned O2 as tolerated, with permissive O2 sats in low
90s. On the floor pt recv'd nebs ATC which eventually
tarnsitioned to as needed as O2 requirment decreased to
baseline. Prednisone burst cont'd with slow month long taper
back instituted on d/c. Eval'd by PT with pt at baseline on d/c.
.
# ROMI: R-sided pleuritic CP suspicious for AMI, but EKG largely
unchanged from prior and 2 sets CE negative.
.
# Cardiac arrhythmia: Known AV pacer s/p ablation for a-fib. Was
continued on dofetilide 375 mcg [**Hospital1 **] and diltiazem 180 mg daily
with good control of ventricular rate. No issues during
hospitalization
