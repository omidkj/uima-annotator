CTA [**2128-6-22**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive, diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with ventricular
enlargement
may represent early communicating or, less likely, obstructive
hydrocephalus.
with blood layering in bilateral lateral ventricular occipital
horns. This
appears stable.

2. 4-mm saccular left carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm, directed
superiorly,
with relatively wide-neck.

CTA Brain [**6-25**] IMPRESSION:

1. No significant interval change in appearance of diffuse
subarachnoid
hemorrhage with slight interval decrease in size of lateral
ventricles. No
new regions of hemorrhage identified.

CT [**7-2**] IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage which appears stable.
Hemorrhage layering
in bilateral occipital horns also stable. No new areas of
hemorrhage.
2. Slight prominence of the ventricles and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**],
unchanged since
prior examination may reflect mild degree of hydrocephalus.
Shunt catheter
terminates in the third ventricle, also unchanged.


2. Decreased vessel caliber involving both posterior cerebral
arteries,
bilateral A2 segments, and the dominant right A1 segment which
may suggest
mild underlying spasm.

MRI Head [**7-3**]

IMPRESSION:

1. Mild increase in the size of the left lateral ventricle, now
measuring 1.5
cm in the transverse dimension compared to the prior of 1.3 cm
on the most
recent CT head.

Blood products noted in the left lateral ventricle, in close
proximity to the
region of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. It is unclear if the mild
increase in the
size of the left lateral ventricle is related to obstruction at
the level of
the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] by the blood products/catheter dysfunction.
To correlate
clinically. Consider close followup CT study to evaluate
interval change or
progression.

2. Tiny punctate possible acute infarcts, one in the right
cerebellar
hemisphere, and another one in the left occipital region, given
by their
appearance on the DWI and the ADC sequences. Close followup MRI
study can be
considered, to assess interval change, as these are very tiny in
size limiting
more accurate assessment.

3. Areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the cerebral sulci and in
the sylvian
fissures and basal cisterns and occipital horns of both alteral
ventricles, as
described above, better evaluated on the prior CT study.

[**7-7**] CTA Brain
IMPRESSION: Hyperdensity seen lateral to the head and body of
the left
caudate (3:19) as well as in the posterior limb of the internal
capsule on the right (3:17). These were not as pronounced on
previous study and may
represent areas of ischemia/infarct. Diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage with
intraventricular hemorrhage stable from previous exam. VP shunt
on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and EVD of the third ventricle, stable.
Anterior and posterior circulations grossly normal, but awaiting
re-do of study.




Brief Hospital Course:
67F trans with SAH.  In ambulance she was noted to have R ptosis
and dilated pupil and c/o occipital HA. She was emergently
brought for a cerebral angiogram and found to have a ruptured L
ICA aneurysm. She was extubated on [**6-23**]. She was alert and
oriented, 5/5 strength, PEERL with sl. R ptosis. On [**6-26**] she was
noted to have lethargy, word finding. CTA/P shows no spasm or
infarct was pan cultured for fevers with no growth from
cultures. She did show signs of clinical vasospasm although
radiographic studies were negative. HHH therapy was initiated
and she clinically improved. Remained on Nimodipine for
vasospasm prophylaxis, she did require multiple pressors to
sustain SBP and Nimodipine was d/c'd overnight. On [**6-28**] her exam
was non-focal and her nimodipine was restarted and HHH therapy
was liberalized. Her exam would wax and wane and all
radiographic studys were negative for spasm and infarct. On [**7-3**]
she was found to have tremors in her RUE and face. EEG was
negative for seizure. On [**7-5**] she received a VPS and MRI/A
showed a very small punctate R cerebellar and bilat pca
occipital lobe infarcts. On [**7-7**] she was noted to have new L
sided weakness in whcih studies were negative for cause although
strength appears symmetrical at this time. She was also febrile
and started on emperic coverage however cultures did grow
anything. LENIs were also negative for DVT. She was then
transferred to the floor and she was not taking adequate PO
intake. Dobhoff remianed in place for nutrition and then d/c'd
prior to discharge. She is A&Ox3, MAE. no drift.
