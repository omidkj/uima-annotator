History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with chief complaint of dyspnea and cough and
malaise with clammy skin and mild hallucinations.    He noted
cough last Thursday without sputum production.  He was short of
breath at the time.  He denies fever/chills/sweats.  He noted
progressive decreased energy and decreasing PO intake.  His wife
states that on [**Name (NI) 1017**] (3 days PTA) he was difficult to wake up
and was only drinking a small amount of fluids.  The following
day was noted to have stopped eating entirely.  He was offered
ED referal by his PCP but declined.  Yesterday he was noted to
be itching and picking at things on his skin and was not making
complete sense when speaking.   He was found to mild
hallucinations yesterday with ringing and fullness in his ears.
The wife states that he has been taking ibuprofen at least 600
mg daily for knee and back pain.

In the ED his initial VS were 97.3  74  74/44  20  86%RA.  He
was placed on CPAP transiently but did not tolerate it.  He had
a cxr that showed potential RLL infiltrate.  He was given 5 L of
NS with improvement in his blood pressure to 90s systolic.  He
had a bedside FAST ultrasound that showed no pericardial
effusion and no intra-abdominal fluid (although abd views were
limited due to obesity).  He was sent to CT torso but developed
tachypnea with no change in his O2sats.  An ABG at that time was
7.18/40/81.  EKG was unchanged from his [**Hospital1 **]-V paced priors. He
was noted to have heme + brown stool.

He was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here
with hypoxic resp failure [**12-26**] presumed CAP, acute kidney injury
and hypotension and an episode of gastroccult positive emesis
now significantly improved
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: This was felt to be likely
secondary to pneumonia with some component of pulmonary edema.
The patient was started on levofloxacin for community acquired
pneumonia. His respiratory status improved. However, he did have
an oxygen requirement at the time of discharge. He was
discharged on 4 L NC of oxygen with plans for follow-up with his
PCP to monitor his need for oxygen as his pneumonia improved.
.
# Gastroccult positive emesis: The patient's nausea resolved
spontaneously and his hematocrit remained stable. The patient's
symptoms were suspected to be secondary to a self-limited viral
process.
.
# Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine was markedly
elevated on admission to 6.6, but resolved to baseline. This was
felt to likely be secondary to over-aggressive NSAID use,
decreased PO and hypotension. The renal service followed the
patient throughout the admission.
.
# Cardiac: The patient had an elevation in CK, MB and troponin
and BNP (no priors) in the setting of volume overload and
infection.  This was felt to likely be an exacerbation of his
underlying ischemic CM. His ECG was without new ischemic
changes. He has a BiV ICD in place. A TTE showed slightly
improved EF. He was continued on aspirin, beta-blocker, statin,
and [**Last Name (un) **].
.
# OSA: The patient was evaluated by the pulmonary sleep team.
