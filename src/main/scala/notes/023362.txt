IMAGING:
[**2178-1-17**] CXR
FINDINGS: Previously noted malpositioned right approached PICC
is now
terminating within the right axilla. There are low lung volumes
with
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/collapse. Bilateral lower lobe
opacification likely atelectasis/collapse. In addition, there is
worsening, now moderate to large right and stable moderate left
pleural effusions. There are increased pulmonary interstitial
markings, compatible with a component of interstitial pulmonary
edema. There are no new focal consolidations concerning for
pneumonia, though an underlying pneumonia particularly at the
bases cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
contours are stable.

IMPRESSION: Worsening now moderate to large right and stable
moderate left
pleural effusion. Bilateral lateral lower lobe
collapse/atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema
.
[**2178-1-20**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-9**] through 27:
Large right pleural effusion has worsened since [**1-19**].
Left lower lobe is severely consolidated, consistently since
[**1-9**], presumably
collapsed. Moderate left pleural effusion increased since
[**1-17**] is
stable since [**1-19**]. Upper lobe vasculature is engorged but
there is no good evidence for severe pulmonary edema. Left PIC
line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is chronic. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2178-1-23**] CXR
FINDINGS: Study is limited due to technique and the lower lung
fields are cut off from the study. There is again seen increased
density surrounding the periphery of the right lung consistent
with known hemothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions and a left
retrocardiac opacity are again seen. There is a right IJ central
venous catheter with distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction
