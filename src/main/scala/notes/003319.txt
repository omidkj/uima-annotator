Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Perforated duodenum s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy in OSH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-6-4**]:
1. Exploratory laparotomy with repair of enterotomy in the
jejunum.
2. Placement of lateral duodenostomy tube for duodenal
perforation.
3. Placement of feeding jejunostomy tube and drainage.
.
[**2146-6-10**]: Placement of a 10Fr internal-external biliary drain
through the right posterior biliary tree.
.
[**2146-6-16**]: Replacement of 10 French internal-external biliary
drainage catheter.


History of Present Illness:
79yM s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy [**2146-6-2**] @ [**Hospital3 **]
with intraoperative drain placement for bleeding and mild bile
spillage who developed bilious drainage on POD1.  He was sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 392**] for ERCP and was found to have a duct of
Luschka leak and is now s/p CBD stent.  He returned to [**Hospital1 **] [**2146-6-3**] in the evening and began to develop some
vague abdominal pain.  He also became distended.  He was
tachycardic to HR: 130's overnight.  A CXR this AM showed free
air and a subsequent CTscan showed free extravasation of
contrast into the gallbladder fossa likely from the duodenal
stump as well as a large amount of free air, pneumomediastinum
and subcutaneous emphysema.

Upon transfer to the ICU, he continued to complain of diffuse
abdominal pain.  He was tachycardic upon presentation to the
TSICU and his BP was stable from 107-110 systolic without
vasopressors.  He had an NGT in place with bilious output and a
foley in place with 40cc over 2 hours.

Social History:
Lives at home with wife who has alzheimer's, and is retired.  No

Physical Exam:
At time of discharge:
Vitals: T 98.2, HR 68, BP 112/55, RR 26, O2sat 96%RA
General: Appears well, in no acute distress, alert and oriented
to person and place but not to time. Obeys simple commands,
awakens and responds to voice and touch.
Cardiac: RRR, holosystolic murmur.
Pulmonary: Diminished breath sounds in the bilateral lung bases,
no rales or rhonchi appreciated. Otherwise, the rest of the lung
fields were CTAB.
Abdomen: 3 drains in place: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube connected to a JP bulb,
a T-tube draining the duodenum connected to a JP bulb, and a
PTBD drain. All three drains are putting out green, billous
appearing discharge. Abdomen was soft, non-tender,
non-distended. Drain sites appeared C/D/I, no erythema or
discharge. Patient has a small wound open to air inferior to the
umbilicus which is healing well. There is no erythema,
discharge, or warmth surrounding the wound. Patient has +BS.
Skin:  Multiple areas of skin breakdown due to tape on abdomen
and neck
Ext:  No lower extremity edema


Pertinent Results:
[**2146-6-13**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small 1.4 x 3.7 cm focus of peri-hepatic fluid along the
course of the
duodenostomy tube.
2. Small 2 x 2 x 3cm fluid collection interposed between colon
and duodenal  stump.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
4. Mild wall thickening of pelvic loops of ileum, cannot exclude
enteritis.
5. Subcentimeter left thyroid lobe hypodensities.  Consider
thyroid
ultrasound if clinically appropriate.
6. Indeterminate left renal lesion

[**2146-6-15**] PA/LAT:
Interval resolution of pulmonary edema with mild persistent
bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.

[**2146-6-15**] LENI: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either the
right or left lower extremity.

[**2146-6-15**] CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Apart from an equivocal filling defect in the left lower lobe
superior
segmental branch there are no filling defects in the main, lobar
or segmental branches concerning for pulmonary embolism.
2. Mild paraseptal emphysema.
3. Mild-to-moderate non-serous right pleural effusion
accompanying adjacent atelectasis.
4. Bilateral pleural plaques with small nodular calcification
suggest prior asbestos exposure.
5. Extensive esophagotracheal aspiration or retained
tracheobronchial
secretion.

[**2146-6-20**] G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK:
1. Contrast filling the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain is worrisome for a leak from
the
duodenum.
2. Duodenostomy tube appears to be in satisfactory position and
unchanged
from prior.

[**2146-6-21**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mitral
stenosis is present, most likely secondary to severe annular
calcification. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

Diagnostic:
TTE [**6-21**]- LVEF 80%, mild symmetric LVH, PCWP>18mmHg, RV dilation
with depressed free wall contractility, mitral stenosis present
& is most likely secondary to severe annular calcification.

[**2146-6-25**] CT Abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in size of the right upper quadrant fluid
loculation
adjacent to the duodenostomy tube; no discrete wall seen
surrounding this
fluid.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased on the left.
3. Multiple small calculi in the right kidney, the largest
measures 6 mm.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification in the abdominal
aorta and
calcification of the mitral valve.
5. Bilateral pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos
exposure.

[**2146-6-25**] CT Head
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
large
vessel territorial infarction, shift of normally midline
structures. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent, likely representing
age-related cortical atrophy. Mild bilateral periventricular
white matter hypodensities are identified and likely sequela of
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No acute fractures are
identified. Mucosal thickening is noted in bilateral maxillary
sinuses as well as the sphenoidal sinuses. Mucosal thickening is
also noted in the right mastoid air cells.

[**2146-7-6**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of moderate diffuse background slowing and frequent runs
of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity. These findings
are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is
etiologically non-specific. There is focal slowing over the left
hemisphere indicative of more prominent focal dysfunction in
this region. No epileptiform discharges or electrographic
seizures are present. Compared to the prior day's recording,
there is no significant change.

[**2146-7-8**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change.  Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, borderline
size of the
cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  Unchanged left PICC
line.  No
larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of
pneumonia.
