Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ultrasound guided biopsy of hepatic mass

History of Present Illness:
73M w/ PMH of CHF (EF 20% per OSH records), Diabetes (on
insulin), and recent diagnosis of pancreatic tail mass was
transfered from OSH for hyponatremia. Pt reports he was in his
usual state of health until ~1mo ago when he had decreased
appetite in the setting of many upsetting life issues, with some
nausea and vomiting. Ovre the past week he reports weight gain
with increasing abdominal girth but denies orthopnea, pnd or
worsening DOE. He reports worsening fatigue with inability to
continue his usual. He reports difficulty urinating but denies
any changes in color or dysuria urinating. He reports overall
not feeling well and went to his PCP where he was found to have
hyponatremia and was called and told to go to the hospital. He
went to lawrenece general where he had labs that were notable
for a Na of 116, WBC of 14.8, Amalyse was 41, and digoxin level
of 0.7. He received benadryl, zofran and NS at 250cc/hr.
In the ED, initial VS were: 20:05 2 100.4 80 94/59 18 98% ra.
His UA was bland, lactate 1.3. CXR showed possible RLL
infiltrate and cardiomegaly per my read. He was given Vanc and
Ceftriaxone and admitted to the MICU for hypotension and
hyponatremia. Her VS on transfer were 99.5 75 98/53 18 97%.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient had no complaints. He
reports no nausea or vomting. He reports having decreased po
intake over the past week, and that he has been tdrinking 15
bottles of water or more per day since he gardens outside in the
heat.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 73 yo M w/ PMH of diabetes on inuslin, CHF with
EF of 20% who was found to have new onset hyponatremia in the
setting of worsening ascites and newly diagnosed pancreatic mass
with hepatic spread.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Hyponatremia- the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for
management of his hyponatremia to 119 which was symptomatic with
some confusion, but no obtundation or seizures.  He was
originally fluid resuscitated given his low blood pressures and
appearance of intravascular depletion, and when his Na did not
respond to this he was switched to diureses after it was found
that he was 10 lbs over his baseline weight. His sodium improved
to 121 at the time of transfer to the floor after being fluid
restricted to 1.5L and given 40 IV lasix. His diuresis was
continued in the MICU until he could be transferred to the floor
(notably, his mental status was at baseline when he was sent to
the floor). His sodium steadily climbed to the mid and high
120s, but on resumption of his home PO furosemide, his sodium
declined from the high to mid 120s. Given the suspicion of poor
absorption from gut edema, the patient was switched to a PO dose
of torsemide (40mg) equivalent to his former PO lasix dose
(80mg). He responded very well to this and his sodium increased
promptly. It was 129 at the time of discharge. Of note, multiple
urine electrolyte studies were used to guide diuresis and the
patient was never terribly sodium avid, even with extensive
diuresis.

#Ascites- The patient had new onset ascites on exam. He denied
abdominal pain. He underwent a diagnostic paracentesis which was
obtained and was a bloody tap. Neither his clinical picture nor
his paracentesis results were consistent with spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis. His ascites did decrease with diuresis,
as did his pedal edema. Given that the patient had no evidence
of acute cardiac decompensation due to intrinsic disease,
medication noncompliance, or dietary indiscretion, it was
thought that this was largely due to the patient's
intra-abdominal neoplasm.

#Pancreatic mass- this was noted on imaging from outside
hospital and he was found to have a pancreatic tail mass.
Multiple hepatic nodules were found as well. The patient
received further workup while at [**Hospital1 18**]. An ultrasound of his
liver was done with subsequent biopsy of an identified mass.
Cytology showed malignant cells consistent with a poorly
differeniated carcinoma. A core biopsy taken from the same
nodule was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Serum CA-19-9 was
1246 and CEA was 8.1.

#Leukocytosis- patient had elevated white blood cell count and
was found to meet SIRS crieria so he
