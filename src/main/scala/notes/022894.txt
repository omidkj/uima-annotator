abdominal wall.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to Surgical ICU and underwent abdominal CT
imaging which did not show any leaks. His tube feedings and home
meds were restarted with exception of his Norvasc due to low
blood pressures with systolic in low 100's.  An abdominal binder
was also ordered.

Once hemodynamically stable he was transferred to floor.

Upon transfer to floor there were no further active issues
during his stay for the malfunctioning gastric tube. He
continued to tolerate his tube feedings.

He is being discharged back to rehab on hospital day 3 and will
return for his Neurosurgical and Neurology follow up as
previously scheduled. Evaluation of resuming his Norvasc should
be ongoing upon return to rehab to determine when can be
restarted.
