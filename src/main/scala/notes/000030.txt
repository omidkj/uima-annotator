History of Present Illness:
45M with history of EtOH cirrhosis, MELD 28 and Child class
C cirrhosis recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] last month for fevers,
anemia, ascites and ARF. In brief, during his recent hospital

Liver/RUQ US ([**2196-8-26**]): 1) Cirrhosis with ascites. 2) New,
partially occlusive main portal vein thrombosis extending into
the left portal vein. Please note, the study is limited because
the right portal vein, splenic vein, portal venous confluence
was
not well visualized. 3) Distended gallbladder without signs of
acute cholecystitis. Findings may be due to a fasting state

gastroesophageal junction, Linear non bleeding erosion at 35 cm.
Erythema, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the
whole

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2196-9-27**], he underwent deceased donor liver transplant.
Surgeon was Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Two 19-French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were
placed posterior to the liver and behind the portal structures.
Please refer to operative note for complete details. Aggressive
blood product resuscitation by anesthesiology staff as well as
administration of protamine was performed. Induction
immunosuppression was started intraop (solumedrol).

Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for management where he
received blood products to maintain hemodynamic stability per
protocol. LFTs initially increased as expected. Hepatic duplex
revealed inadequate flow demonstrated within the right posterior
portal vein which could have been technical in nature versus a
small amount of thrombus. Patency and appropriate direction of
flow within the hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, and the left
and main portal veins was seen. Splenomegaly was noted. A repeat
study on [**10-1**] revealed patency and appropriate direction of flow
within the hepatic and portal venous systems. High flow
velocities in the main portal vein, with aliasing in the
expected region of the anastomosis were noted. There was
notation of fatty infiltration of the liver. LFTs trended down
(ast 580, alt 530, alk phos 130, t.bili 6.6). JP outputs
remained high averaging 900-1100ml per day. LFTs started to
trend up on postop day 4 and 5. JP output appeared foamy.

On [**10-4**], an ERCP was performed noting common bile duct with mild

narrowing at the bile duct anastomosis, and minimal associated
proximal ductal
dilatation. There were no filling defects in the CBD or
intrahepatic ducts.
There was no evidence of bile leakage. A plastic biliary stent
was placed. Post procedure, amylase and lipase were wnl. JP
drain outputs continued to be high averaging as much as
2200ml/day. IV fluid replacements and albumin were administered
per output. The lateral JP was removed on [**10-5**]. The medial JP
continued to drain as much as 1800ml per day. IV lasix was given
for anasarca over several days. Teds stockings were applied with
improvement of edema. Weight decreased to 90.4 Kg on [**10-16**] from
117.4 on [**9-26**]. The medial JP was removed on [**9-14**]. The site
remained dry after suturing.

Of note, alk phos continued to rise to 518. Repeat ERCP was done
on [**10-13**]. There was no obstruction of the biliary stent. The
stent was exchanged. The alk phos continued to increase. On
[**10-14**], a liver biopsy was performed noting no rejection. Marked
bile ductular proliferation with associated neutrophilic
inflammation, focal ductal dilation, marked cholestasis, bile
plug formation and portal tract edema; Rare foci of mild portal
mononuclear inflammation with scattered eosinophils; no
endothelialitis or diagnostic involvement by acute cellular
rejection identified. No steatosis or viral inclusion was seen.
Rare peri-venular lipofuscin-laden macrophages, suggestive of
resolving reperfusion injury. After the ERCP, LFTS trended down
(ast 31, alt 33, alk phos 276, t.bili 1.6). The postop pyloric
feeding tube was replaced on [**10-6**] as this was removed during the
ERCP.

He experienced ATN likely from intraop hemodynamics. Creatine
was 1.0 on on [**9-27**]. This started to rise postop to as high as
5.2 on postop day 5. Very gradually, creatinine improved with.
Creatinine decreaed to 1.8 on [**10-13**], but started to trend up
again to 2.0 likely from Prograf as this trough was elevated.
Levels increased to 14.1 on [**10-16**]. Prograf dose was adjusted to
0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-16**] for 1mg [**Hospital1 **]. Immunusuppression consisted of
cellcept 1gram [**Hospital1 **] which was well tolerated. Solumedrol which
was tapered per transplant protocol to prednisone. Prograf was
started on postop day 1 and adjusted per trough levels.

Diet was slowly advanced, but poorly tolerated as the patient
had no appetite. A postpyloric feeding tube was placed and tube
feedings were started (novasource renal). Oral intake slowly
increased, but was insufficient to support caloric needs.
