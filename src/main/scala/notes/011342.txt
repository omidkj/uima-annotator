Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Captopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
tranfser for lead revision

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Company 1543**] Concerto pacemaker/Defibrillator placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 y/o M w/ a h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p CABG,
Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin, prior VT ablation with BiV
Pacer/ICD who had nearly 20 episodes of his ICD discharging
yesterday.  Reports that he was going to bed at which time he
felt light headed.  At that point, his AICD fired several times,
and then continuosly.  He then activated 911 and was brought to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
.
At the OSH, ECG showed complete heart block with occasional [**9-4**]
second pauses with no capturing of his device.  Was shortly
transcutaneously paced before patient's device was changed to LV
pacing by a [**Company **] representative (DOO).  Patient's device
was interrogated and findings were interpreted as a possible
lead fracture rather than true VT.  Reportedly device discharged
28 separate times.  He has a fidelis lead which is known to be
at risk for fracture and has been recalled.  Initial plan was
for the patient to have a temporary wire placed, but LV pacing
functioning well.  Patient was reportedly tolerating these
settings well.  Tranfser was arranged to [**Hospital1 18**] for lead
extraction and revision.
.
On arrival in the CCU, initial VS were T98.7, HR 61, BP 104/83,
RR 15, 94% RA. Patient denied any complaints.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for mild decrease in
exercise tolerance.  Had previously been able to walk several
miles w/o interruption, but in recent months he reports he has
only been able to walk a few hundred feet before feeling short
of breath.  He denies chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, increased ankle edema, palpitations.  He reports his
dry weight as 185 lbs, and recently has been taking increased
doses of lasix, coreg and dig as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].

.
Chest X-ray ([**2152-5-29**]): Four transvenous leads running from the
left
power pack are unchanged since [**2150-1-26**]. Two are pacer leads
ending in the
right atrium and alongside the left ventricle respectively, and
two are
defibrillator leads ending in the right ventricle. No
discontinuity is visible in any lead. Moderate cardiomegaly is
not significantly changed from prior. The pulmonary vasculature
is normal. Increased density at the right lung base be either
consolidation or summation of soft tissue. No pneumothorax or
pleural effusion is present. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of
volume overload or acute cardiac decompensation. 2. Possible
right basal pneumonia or atelectasis, more likely overlyting
soft tissue.
.

Chest X-ray ([**2152-5-30**]): In comparison with the study of [**5-29**], the
degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is somewhat decreased.
Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. No
definite change in appearance of the various leads.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS
Patient is a 66 y/o M w/ ischemic CM, prior CABG, s/p BiV
pacer/ICD placement, and h/o VT s/p ablation who presents with
RV lead fracture, resulting inappropriate discharge of ICD, and
underlying complete heart block now dependent on LV lead for
pacing.
.
#. Lead Fracture/Heart Block: Received new pacer/ICD [**2152-5-29**] but
required Vitamin K and platelets to reverse INR before
procedure. On [**5-30**], patient had multiple episodes of asymptomatic
NSVT with spontaneous termination and no ICD firing. This
subsequently resolved without intervention and he had no further
episodes while inpatient. CXR confirmed lead placement and
coumadin was restarted.  He was continued on vancomycin
peri-operatively then discharged on oral antibiotics. He will
f/u in device clinic 1 week
.
#. Chronic Systolic Heart failure w/o acute exacerbation/Dilated
 Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: Class III heart failure by symptoms.
He was continued on digoxin, lasix and valsartan.
.
#. CAD: He was continued on aspirin, simvastatin
.
#. Afib: Rate controlled with complete heart block and pacer
dependent. INR reversed with vitamin K and FFP then restarted at
discharge
.
#. HTN: Well-controlled on carvedilol, diovan
