History of Present Illness:
HPI: 81 y/o M w/COPD on home O2, dCHF, Myelodysplasia w/excess
blasts, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia from [**Date range (1) 24350**].
Per d/c summary, pt initially went to [**Hospital6 20592**] for leg pain. At that time he was found to be in ARF
w/elevated CK, and had "evidence of CHF and COPD flare" as well
as pancytopenia with 15% blasts. Here he was initially in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia (93% on RA) and concern for blast crisis. He
did well, tolerated fluid resuscitation, and did not require
intubation. He was seen by Heme-Onc, who felt he did not have
AML but had Myelodysplasia with excess blasts. His renal failure
resolved with hydration (0.8 on d/c, from 2.1). Per the family's
request, he was transferred back to [**Location (un) **] on [**7-4**], and was
discharged to home from there on [**7-5**]. He finished a course of
antibiotics on [**7-6**].

He was discharged home on 2 liters oxygen although he had not
been on this prior. He was doing well post-d/c per his daughter,
but over the past few days has been more lethargic, decreased po
intake, increasing shortness of breath. He was febrile to 102
last pm. His mental status remained at baseline (alert,
oriented, interactive) with the exception of one episode of
confusion last pm which resolved within minutes. He has no
dysuria but per the daughter has had diarrhea and urinary/fecal
incontinence over the past 3-4 weeks with inability to tell when
he is stooling or urinating. He had no focal weakness, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, or other symptoms.

At the OSH ED, he was tachypneic in 40s with o2 sat 80s, and was
placed on bipap. He was transferred here for further w/u. In our
ED, he was febrile to 101.9, hypotensive to the 70s/50s, with o2
sat 99% on bipap. Has had 20 cc UOP.

[**7-24**] MR L spine
FINDINGS: There is a transitional vertebra between the lumbar
spine and the sacrum. For the purposes of this dictation, the
most inferior disk will be referred to as S1/2, and the
transitional vertebra will be referred to as partially
lumbarized S1.

Bone marrow signal is diffusely abnormal, consistent with
diffuse bone infiltration by tumor. There is a suggestion of
cortical destruction in the posterior inferior endplate of L3,
posterior superior endplate of L4, posterior inferior endplate
of L5, and posterior superior endplate of S1. Mild compression
deformities are seen in all of the visualized vertebrae from T12
through S1, likely secondary to pathologic fractures. There is
no bone marrow edema on the STIR images to suggest that these
fractures are acute. The conus terminates at L1. No compression
of the conus is noted.

At L3/4, there is a disc bulge and a more focal right
paracentral herniation, which displaces the nerve roots medially
and posteriorly. In addition, there is a shallow, small epidural
mass extending from the posterior vertebral body into the right
neural foramen, which may represent epidural tumor or a mottled
osteophyte- CT could provide differentiation between the two
etiologies.
There is only mild associated narrowing of the right neural
foramen.

At L4/5, there is facet spondylosis and a disc bulge with mild
associated central stenosis and lateral recess narrowing
bilaterally.

At L5/S1, there is a disc bulge and facet spondylosis with mild
central stenosis and bilateral lateral recess narrowing.

Lenticular epidural structures are noted extending from L3
through L5 posterior to the vertebral bodies and anterior to the
thecal sac, with high signal on T1- and T2-weighted images.
These likely represent epidural fat, and less likely distended
epidural veins. This appearance is not consistent with epidural
tumor.

The following preliminary report was given by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to a
resident caring for the patient at 12:30 a.m. on [**2136-7-25**]:
Abnormal signal in vertebral bodies. Disc herniation impinging
on the thecal sac on the right at L3/4. No spinal cord
compression.

The final report was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9570**] at 1:45 p.m. on
[**2136-7-25**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bone marrow infiltration by tumor, with probable
cortex destruction at multiple levels. Probable epidural
extension of tumor into the right L3/4 neural foramen with mild
foramen narrowing.
2. Small right paracentral disc herniation at L3/4, which
displaces the nerve roots.
3. Mild central stenosis and lateral recess narrowing at L4/5
and L5/S1.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
1. Hypotension:  Patient was likely hypotensive from dehydration
secondary to diarrhea.  Once he was fluid resucitated his BP
returned to [**Location 213**].  He was then normotensive for the remainder
of the admission.  Cortisol stim test was normal.  Anti HTN meds
were held.

2. Fever/Diarrhea:  [**Month (only) 116**] be related in that patient has c.diff
from recent Abx course and profound diarrhea.  C diff was neg x
2 but patient was treated with empiric flagyl.  Sent home to
complete a 14 day course.  Rectal tube placed in MICU.  By the
third day the diarrhea had resolved (either spontaneously or due
to the flagyl).  He had no diarrhea for the rest of the
admission.
