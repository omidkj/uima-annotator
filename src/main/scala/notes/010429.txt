headache, but when asked specifically she feels that her vision
might be "a little off."

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 2 ("[**2085**]"). Able to relate
history without difficulty.  Inattentive, unable to name [**Doctor Last Name 1841**]
backward.  Language is fluent with intact repetition and
comprehension.  Normal prosody.  There were a few paraphasic
errors (e.g. Three for tree).  Pt. was able to name high but not
low frequency objects. Unable to read, but due to visual field
cut and neglect. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to follow both
midline and appendicular commands. Pt. was able to register 3
objects and recall [**1-29**] at 5 minutes.  The pt. had good knowledge
of current events.  There was clear evidence of left-sided
neglect (in bisecting lines, describing cookie theft, only get
right side.). Also severe difficulty with constructional praxis.
GCS 15.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 5 to 3mm and brisk. Left homonymous hemianopia.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or
hemorrhages.
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus.  Normal saccades.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
Laboratory Data:
142  103  20  135
4.0  28  1.1
Ca: 9.7 Mg: 2.1 P: 3.1

WBC: 17.4; Hct: 38.8; Plt: 314
 N:89.8 L:8.4 M:1.4 E:0.1 Bas:0.3

PT: 26.1  PTT: 32.1  INR: 2.6

EKG: Atrial paced at 60 bpm.

NCHCT: [**2186-7-3**]:  1. Large right posterior parenchymal hemorrhage
with intraventricular and
subdural extension. Mass effect and edema results in right
cerebral sulcal
effacement, mild shift of normally midline structures by 5-6 mm.
Patent
basilar cisterns. Close followup is recommended.
2. No acute fracture.

NCHCT: [**2186-7-9**]:  : No appreciable change in the appearance of
large right sided
intraparenchymal hemorrhagem, with associated mass effect as
described above,
compared with the study of [**2186-7-6**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Neurologically:  Patient was admitted initially to the ICU.  All
subsequent scans from [**Date range (1) 79404**] were stable without change.  The
location of the bleed suggested amyloid angiopathy, however
because of her pacemaker this could not be confirmed with MRI.
Blood pressure was controlled with lisinopril and prn lopressor
without difficulty.  After 72 hours in the ICU she was
transferred to the floor where she continued to be stable.  Her
dense left field cut was unchanged at baseline, and she
additionally had some left visual neglect.  She was otherwise
neurologically intact. A follow up CT of her head with contrast
was ordered for [**2186-8-18**] to check whether there is neoplasm
underlying the blood that cannnot be appreciated currently.

Cardiovascularly:  The patient has a pace-maker, and has been in
a sinus rythem for at least one year now according to PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
remained in sinus during admission.  Coumadin was of course
stopped with plan for this to likely be a long term
discontinuation because of bleed risk.

ID: Patient had a lowgrade fever [**2192-7-8**] overnight and UA and
CXR unremarkable.  No antibiotics were started.  WBC was normal.

There were no other organ systems involved.
