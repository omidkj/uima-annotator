History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3236**] is a 78 year-old man with gout, HLD, HTN, Afib and
dementia who presents in the setting of being found down at his
home. Patient was not seen or spoken to since for 7 days and
when patient did not answer phone call yesterday, his family
became concerned. Patient has underlying dementia and lives at
home alone with family visiting regularly.

  In the ED, initial VS were 160 154/92 20 80%RA (w/bad pleth
with 115 PaO2 on ABG). Labs were notable for WBC 14.8, HCT 53.3,
PLTs 167, INR 13.0, PTT 58.6, Fibrinogen 731, ALT 19, AST 80,
Lip 29, Tbili 1.5, Alb 3.2, Na 141, K6.6 that corrected to 4.2
with 2L NS, HCO3 25, Cr 1.2, CK 692 that rose to 739 after 2L NS
and Lactate 2.9, ABG 7.46/33/115. UA notable 99 RBC, 8 WBC and
many Bact. Patient was never hypoxic. Guaiac negative. Patient
was also noted to have a swollen and edematous left arm. LUE
U/S, CXR, CT head were reassuring. CT C-spne identified wideding
of the C1-occipital codyle joint and high density material near
the dens. Patient received tetanus toxoid vaccine for laceration
to left side of face. Patient also received 3L NS IV, metoprolol
5mg IV x2 for Atrial fibrillation and ceftriaxone 1g IV for UTI.
Given concern for compartment syndrome in LUE the patient was
admitted to MICU for further monitoring. Vitals signs on
transfer were 115 129/89 20 100% on 2L NC

  On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared comfortable and
was oridented x3 and ansering question approriately although
still confabulating (patient stated that his wife was in the
hospital, when in fact his wife has passed away).

Studies:

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-5-12**] 6:07
PM
IMPRESSION: Limited study, however, no acute intrathoracic
process

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-5-12**]
6:08 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. High density material
near the
dens is better characterized on concurrent neck CT, however,
additional
imaging is recommended.

Radiology Report CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-5-12**]
6:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture.
2. Widening of the atlanto-occipital joint. High density
material seen near the dens may represent pannus and degernative
changes, however given trauma setting, the presence of blood
products is not excluded. MR is recommended for further
characterization.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.

Radiology Report UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT Study Date of
[**2137-5-12**] 8:49 PM
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity

Cervical spine MRI without contrast [**5-13**]:
1.  Increased distance between the dens and the clivus with
extensive pre-, anterior and posterior para-vertebral, and
circumferential  epidural soft tissue at C2 level causing
moderate spinal canal narrowing and deforming the spinal cord
with minimal edema in the cord.  While these can relate an
inflammatory component along with degenerative
changes,associated post-traumatic changes and superimposed
hemorrhage/hematoma cannot be completely excluded.
Post-contrast sequences- axial T1 post ; sag T1 post contrast
with fat
sequences, axial GRE seq. including from clivus  and Diffusion
sequences for cord can be helpful for better characterization
and to differentiate the etiology. If any priors are made
available, comparison can be made. Given the possible
instability, apprporiate c. spine precautions to be taken. Edema
in the posterior spinous soft tissues from C2-C5 level
with/without injury to the ligaments.
2.  Multilevel multifactorial degenerative changes noted in the
cervical spine with moderate canal stenosis at C3/4, C5/6 and
C6/7 level.

Radiology Report MR CERVICAL SPINE with and without contrast
[**5-14**]:
4:52 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive homogenously enhancement in the pre-vertebral,
para-vertebral, and circumferential epidural soft tissue, and
peripherally enhancing posterior epidural collection at C2 level
causing moderate spinal canal narrowing and deforming the spinal
cord. These likely represent post traumatic changes with
epidural hematoma. However, the  possibility of infection with
epidural abscess cannot be ruled out. There is no intrinsic
signal abnormality within the spinal cord.
2. Circumferential enhancement of the epidural soft tissues from
C1 to C6
level.
3. Edema in the dens and posterior spinous soft tissues from C2
to C5 levels.
4.  High T2 signal intensity in the left vertebral artery at the
level of
C1/C2, suggesting slow flow, however thrombosis/di
