Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

anastamosis
[**2153-2-18**]: re-do ex-lap, small bowel resection and primary
anastamosis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81F with a history of schizoaffective disorder
and multiple comorbidities who was admitted to the medical
service s/p fall in the setting of hypotension and abdominal
pain. Prior to presentation, patient stated that she was having
rectal pain, increasing abdominal girth, and intermittent
abdominal pain. She also reports episodes of bilious vomiting
over the last year with dark stools. She has had weight loss of
unknown quantity which she attributes to poor appetite.

On admission, patient was not found to have any injuries but did
have a CT scan showing a new rectal mass, pancreatic tail mass
that is increased in size, and multiple pulmonary nodules. Her
CT also showed mild small bowel thickening with possible
thickening consistent with gastroenteritis or ischemia.
Patient's abdominal pain had largely resolved at that point, so
she was kept NPO, hydrated with IV fluids, and serially
examined. Lactate trended down from 2 to 1.2. Patient was seen
by gastroenterology for visceral masses and an NGT was placed.
Tube put out 850 cc of feculent appearing material over 24
hours.

On the day the surgical consult was placed, she began to
complain of worsening right sided abdominal pain. She has had
low grade tachycardia with moderate urine output (275 for 18
hours today). Her acute kidney injury has worsened. Surgery was
consulted after repeat CT showed worsened small bowel thickening
and interloop fluid. She currently complains of significant
nausea and abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes, Schizoaffective disorder, COPD, HTN, CAD,
Hypercholesterolemia, GERD, h/o head injury @ age 11

Past Surgical History:
Perforated duodenal ulcer in [**2148**] s/p cholecystectomy, anterior
parietal cell vagotomy, and [**Location (un) **] patch closure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Social History:
She denies alcohol and tobacco use. Never married. Patient has a
sister with whom she has not spoken for several years.


Family History:
Sister has history of breast cancer

STUDIES
EKG
Baseline artifact. Probable sinus tachycardia with a single
ventricular premature beat. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing of 11 [**9-25**] the rate is faster. Ventricular
premature beat is new. ST-T wave abnormalities are new. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is partly
calcified. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. Cholecystectomy clips project over
the right upper quadrant.
.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2153-2-6**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
.
1. Borderline dilated loops of fluid-filled small bowel with
trace inter-loop fluid in the mesenteric root, which is
non-specific. A few loops of small bowel in the pelvis have
bowel wall thickening. While this can be seen in
gastroenteritis, the history of hypotension raises the
possibility of a low-flow bowel ischemia. No pneumatosis or free
intraperitoneal air. There are extensive atherosclerotic
calcifications in the aorta and its branches without obvious
arterial thrombus. No bowel obstruction.
2. No evidence of colitis. Normal appendix.
3. Eccentric wall thickening in the right posterior rectum.
Correlate with
rectal exam. Consider colonoscopy if clinically warranted.
4. Pancreatic tail cystic lesion is unchanged from [**Month (only) **]
[**2152**], but has
increased in size from [**2148**], again raising the possibility of
neoplasm.
5. 4mm right lower lobe nodule unchanged from [**2152-11-23**]. The
other pulmonary nodules seen on the prior CT are not included on
this study and follow is recommended per the [**2152-11-23**] report.
.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2153-2-9**]
1. Dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.8 cm,
relatively
transitioning to normal caliber in the ileum. Worsening
concentric wall
thickening in the distal ileum and ascending colon, highly
concerning for
bowel ischemia, likely resulting in a non-mechanical SBO.
2. Eccentric wall thickening in the right posterior rectum and
pancreatic
tail cystic lesion, are similar to the prior study and need
further
evaluation.

CT Head [**2153-2-16**]:
No acute intracranial process. If clinical concern for
intracranial mass or stroke is high, MRI is more sensitive.

EEG [**2153-2-15**]:
Abnormal EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the
background, bursts of generalized slowing, and occasional left
frontocentral sharp waves. The first two abnormalities signify a
widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and infections are among the most common causes. The bifrontal
sharp waves indicate an area of cortical hypersynchrony. There
were no repetitive discharges to suggest ongoing seizures.

CXR [**2153-3-1**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pigtail
catheter
has been removed. There is no evidence of recurrent pleural
effusion.
Remnant basal atelectasis at the left lung base. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, improvement in lung
transparency of the right lung, presumably reflecting improved
ventilation. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube and of the
right PICC line.


Brief Hospital Course:
                        ** PRIOR TO SURGICAL INTERVENTION **
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from the ED to the medical service for
management of her abdominal pain and hypotension. Her hospital
course from [**2153-2-6**] to [**2153-2-9**] is described below by problem:

# ABDOMINAL PAIN- On admission patient was noted to have diffuse
lower abdominal pain with associated abdominal distension.
Initial CT demonstrated some small bowel thickening which was
non specific and consistent with gastroenteritis versus ischemia
from a low flow state from her recent hypotension. Dilated loops
of bowel were present but there was no clear transition point
which was suggestive of ileus. There were no signs of colitis.
The patient was kept NPO and started on IVF for hydration in
addition to a bowel re
