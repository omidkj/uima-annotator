[**2148-1-31**] CXR: No previous images. The heart is normal in size, and
there is no
evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. However,
there is patchy
opacification in the left lower lung worrisome for pneumonia.
[**2148-1-31**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Tracing is without diagnostic
abnormality. No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2148-2-2**] RUQ US: 1. Diffuse, tiny echogenic areas within the liver
can be seen in hepatitis. No focal liver lesion identified. 2. 7
mm echogenic structure within the gallbladder most likely
represents an adherent stone. 3. Nonobstructing left renal
stone.


Brief Hospital Course:
57-year-old male with unclear past medical history who presented
with altered mental status that improved after administration of
narcan.

# Altered mental status: The patient was admitted with
somnolence. He was opiate and cocaine positive by labs. He was
started on a Narcan drip which greatly improved his mental
status. Thus he likely overdosed on an opiate. The patient was
found with multiple medications that were not prescribed to him.
He denied taking any of the medications including morphine. CXR
and UA without evidence of infection. The patient was weaned off
the Narcan drip without problems. [**Name (NI) **] was closely observed and
showed no signs of withdrawal. Social work was consulted and the
patient was discharged.

# Hypoxia: Initially the patient had an oxygen requirement.
Given his questionable history of COPD he was started on Advair
and duonebs. His oxygen was easily weaned off and CXR was
without evidence of infection.

# Acute renal failure: The patient was given IVF and his
creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] range. Likely secondary to
pre-renal etiology.

# Transaminitis: The patient had down-trending enzymes. He had a
normal RUQ US. This will need to be followed by his primary care
physician to ensure resolution.

# Social issues: The patient was released to the care [**Street Address(1) 86347**] Inn. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**] is his case manager. The patient was
full code for the admission
