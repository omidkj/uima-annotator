Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope and dizziness
.
Reason for MICU transfer: s/p PEA arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE

History of Present Illness:
81 y/o F w/ HTN, DM2, and h/o AAA graft repair in [**2108**] c/b leaks
requiring multiple endovascular repairs (most recently [**Month (only) 116**]
[**2112**]), presented today after a likely syncopal event.  She
reportedly passed out and upon awakening, alerted the emergency
call bell and EMS found her on the bathroom floor.  Upon arrival
to the ED she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, fever or
cough.  She endorsed feeling dizzy, weak and had abdominal
discomfort.
.
Initial ED vitals were 95.4F, HR 65, 103/49 RR 16 100% 3L.
Shortly after arrival her BP dropped to 80/50s, lactate was 6.5,
and she was started on fluids and received vancomycin/zosyn for
empiric coverage for septic shock.  Due to the abdominal
discomfort and hypotension in setting of prior AAA, CT
abd/pelvis was completed which showed stable AAA in size, leak
present but unchanged, and also revealed RA dilitation and
hepatic congestion.  This led to suspicion for acute right heart
failure secondary to a large pulmonary embolism.  Bedside
ultrasound showed a dilated IVC.  Vascular was contact[**Name (NI) **]
regarding risk of lysis with AAA leak and decision was made to
pursue tPA.  The patient then went into PEA arrest (duration ~
10 minutes), CPR initiated and pulse spontaneously returned
after epinephrine and atropine were administered.  Approximately
15 minutes later she re-entered PEA arrest (duration ~35
minutes).  100mg tPA was given during the code.  She was
intubated, not sedated, placed on levophed, phenylephrine and
epinephrine for pressor support, and transfered to the MICU.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, she was intubated, non-responsive,
not moving any extremities or withdrawing to pain, and pupils
were fixed and dilated bilaterally.  Vasopressin was started for
additional pressor support.  Lactate increased from 6 -> 13 ->
16.  Fluids were hung wide open.  She received one unit of PRBC
with appropriate increase in HCT from 28 -> 31 -> 35.  Bicarb
was persistently low 16 -> 15 -> 9 -> 7, therefore bolus of 2
amps of bicarb were given and she was started on a bicarb drip.
She developed wide-complex ventricular tachycardia (maintained
pulse throughout) and was given amiodarone 150mg IV x1 with
conversion to sinus rhythm.  Glucose was elevated ~ 600s, she
was therefore given insulin bolus followed by initiation of an
insulin drip.  PTT was persistently >150 and INR was elevated,
therefore arterial line was postponed.  Artic sun was placed
with temperature goal 33-34C.  Bedside ECHO showed RV strain
suggestive of pulmonary embolism.  TEE was then completed which
showed borderline RV function without clot seen within the main
pulmonary artery.  Her two grandsons were periodically updated
on her critical condition and voiced that wishes were for
patient to remain full code with aggressive resuscitative care.
