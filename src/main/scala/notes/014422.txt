[**2176-10-28**] CXR
An endotracheal tube has been placed with the distal tip
approximately 5.9 cm from the carina in satisfactory placement.
A nasogastric tube is also noted which extends off the inferior
edge of the radiograph projecting over the left upper quadrant.
Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles likely indicates small
effusions. No definite consolidation or superimposed edema is
noted.  There is aortic tortuosity. There is prominence of the
bilateral hila presumably due to enlarged pulmonary arteries.
The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable. No
pneumothorax is evident. There are no displaced fractures.
Fracture deformity of the anterior right fifth rib likely
reflects remote healed trauma.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. No definite acute pulmonary process
identified.  There is suggestion of small bilateral pleural
effusions. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.

[**2176-10-29**]  CTA HEAD NECK
CT HEAD: There is a large amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage
diffusely filling the basal cisterns, bilateral Sylvian
fissures, frontal, temporal and parietal sulci, and the anterior
interhemispheric fissure. A large amount of blood is also seen
in bilateral lateral ventricles, third and fourth ventricles.
There is no shift of midline structures. There is some degree of
cerebral edema. There is no definite large vascular territorial
infarction seen. There is mild mucosal thickening of the right
inferior maxillary sinus. Rest of the paranasal sinuses appear
unremarkable. There is no fracture identified on the
non-dedicated images provided. There is a moderate sized
8.0x1.5cm fat attenuation lesion in the left parietal scalp with
some subcutaneous thickening.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage involving both cerebral
hemispheres,
basal cisterns, and Sylvian fissures.
2. Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage involving all
ventricles.
3. Moderate-to-severe vasospasm involving bilateral MCA and ACA
branches and distal vertebral and Basilar arteries.
4. Prominent basilar tip may represent a patulous tip of the
basilar artery with branch vessels arising from it, possibility
of a basilar tip aneurysm can not be excluded.


[**2176-10-29**] CT HEAD
FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a ventriculostomy
shunt
through a burr hole in the right lateral aspect of the frontal
bone, coursing through the right lateral ventricle and
terminating in the inferior aspect of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of hemorrhage
surrounding the catheter.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of ventriculostomy catheter through the
right lateral aspect of the frontal bone and terminating in the
inferior portion of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle. Expected post-surgical changes.
2. Large subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the convexities of
both
hemispheres, interhemispheric fissure, Sylvian fissures, ambient
cisterns, and interpeduncular fossa. No shift of midline
structures. Increased layering of blood products in the
dependent portions of the lateral ventricles.
3. No significant change in ventricle size or configuration.


[**2176-10-31**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild fluid
overload. Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases. No evidence of
acute parenchymal opacities. The position of the nasogastric
tube is unchanged.


[**2176-10-31**]  DOPPLER RUE
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right
arm.

[**2176-11-4**] CTA HEad
1. 2 x 2 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm not visible
on prior CTA of the head on [**2176-10-28**].
2. Resorption of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar
cistern, sylvian cisterns, ambient cisterns and cerebral
convexities.
3. No new hemorrhage.
4. No hydrocephalus or shift of midline structures.
5. Patulous basilar artery tip, not indicative of aneurysm
formation.

PORTABLE HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST [**2176-11-6**]
1. No evidence of new hemorrhage or territorial infarction.
Evaluation of
acute infarction is limited due to streak artifact from aneurysm
coil using CT imaging modality. If there is continued concern
for acute ischemia, MRI with DWI (if feasible) is a more
sensitive test.
2. Evolution of subarachnoid and intraventricular blood.
3. Unchanged placement of ventriculostomy catheter, with no
evidence of
hydrocephalus

CT head [**2176-11-8**]
1. Stable ventricular sizes after clamping of EVD.
2. No new areas of hemorrhage. Continued evolution of blood
products in the interhemispheric fissure, cerebral convexities,
and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
3. No shift of midline structures

[**2176-11-9**] CXR
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lower lung
volumes.
Substantial right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.
Small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusion is presumed. There is no pneumothorax
and the
upper lungs are clear. Left subclavian line ends at the junction
of
brachiocephalic veins. Thoracic aorta is extremely tortuous and
generally
large but not focally aneurysmal. No pneumothorax

[**2176-11-9**] CTA head
1. Evolution of extensive subarachnoid blood products throughout
the
frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, with intraventricular
extension, in comparison to the [**2176-11-8**] examination.
2. Unchanged moderate ventriculomegaly.
3. No evidence of vasospasm.
4. Interval coiling of Acom A aneurysm

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2176-11-12**]
 Thrombosis of one right and one left posterior tibial vein

[**2176-11-12**] LENIS
IMPRESSION: Thrombosis of one right and one left posterior
tibial vein.

[**2176-11-14**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate ventriculomegaly with no evidence of
worsening
hydrocephalus since drainage catheter clamping.
2. Evolving bilateral frontal lobe infarcts, right greater than
left, in the A2 distribution of the anterior cerebral artery.
3. Evidence of chronic right maxillary sinusitis with a
superimposed acute
component or merely pooling of secretions due to patient
position.

[**2176-11-15**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate ventriculomegaly with no marked change in
hydrocephalus 48 hours after clamping the EVD.
2. Stable evolving bilateral ACA territory frontal lobe
infarcts, likely due to va
