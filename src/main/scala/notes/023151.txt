[**Age over 90 4448**] placement, hypertension, referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
evaluation for cardiac catheterization by his cardiologist when
he was found to have ECG changes and new global hypokinesis and
depressed ejection fraction on echocardiogram at his clinic
visit.  At the visit, the patient noted dyspnea on exertion over
the past one to two months when he exercises.  He walks three
times per week on the treadmill.  He also noted a 30 minute
episode of left substernal chest pressure that developed about
one week ago and resolved after three sublingual nitroglycerin

nausea, diaphoresis, and did not radiate.  He does not get chest
pressure when he exercises.  Over the past month he has
developed some shortness of breath with laying flat at night.

note this.  He denies fevers, chills, sweats, cough,
palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria or

Pertinent Results:

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo man with history of coronary artery disease, found to have
ST-depressions and echo with global hypokinesis and reduced EF
at cardiologist's office, admitted for cardiac cath, with
hospitalization complicated by bleeding hematoma necessitating
brief CCU stay.  During his hospitalization the following issues
were addressed:.
1. Coronary artery disease:  Patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization.  On admission he creatinine was elevated above
baseline and his INR was elevated on coumadin.  Coumadin was
held, and acute [**Age over 90 **] failure was treated with gentle hydration.
 He underwent cardiac cath with PCI DES to LAD on [**2198-7-27**].
After cath, coumadin was resumed heparin gtt continued for a
subtherapeutic INR in the setting of history of Afib and
recurrent SVT.  On [**2198-7-29**] he developed a large right groin
hematoma, and Hct dropped acutely from 27 to 19.  He was taken
to the CCU, a central line placed, and transfused 4units PRBC.
The hematoma stabilized with clamp pressure.  He was called out
of the CCU the following day, and required one subsequent unit
PRBC during his hospitalization to maintain a Hct greater than
30.  Heparin and coumadin was discontinued.  Coumadin will
likely be restarted as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when he is
stable.  He was continued on aspirin and Plavix for secondary
prevention.  He is not on a beta-blocker or ACE-I due to adverse
reactionsin past (wheezing to former, ARF to latter).  His
troponins did rise during the period of acute blood and
hypotension loss due to demand ischemia.  No further
interventions were done. He was started on imdur for BP control.
2.  CHF:  EF is reported at 35%. The patient remained euvolemic
throughout.  He was diuresed briefly after the blood
transfusions.
3.  Afib: Patient has a h/o Afib maintained on Rhythmol.  This
was changed to sotolol, which he tolerated well.
Anticoagulation will be restarted as an outpatient as discussed
above.
4.  Acute [**Last Name (STitle) **] failure on [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] insufficiency: Baseline
creatinine is 1.6.  The patient was admitted wit an elevated
creat 2.4 that corrected with hydration. It remained stable
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.  All
medications were renally dosed.
5. PVD with [**Last Name (STitle) **] ulcer.  He was evaluated by [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**] in
house and will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. Dressing
changes qd per VNA.
5.  Dispo:   Patient was discharged to home with services.  He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
