Rads:
[**5-25**]: CXR: Patient has had right upper thoracoplasty. Pleural
thickening and scarring is present in the apex of the post
resection right upper lung. Opacification in the infrahilar
right lower lung could be scarring but acute infection cannot be
excluded. There is no good evidence for pneumonia in the left
lung. Heart is normal size. Pleural calcification or linear
atelectasis is present at the right base, there also appears to
be a small amount of fibrosis, but no appreciable pleural
effusion is present nor is there evidence of pneumothorax
.
Recent data:
[**5-20**] C Cath
LMCA--no sign disease
LAD--Diffuse calcific disease, serial 50% lesion and mid vessel
80% lesion
LCX--TO distally with LPDA filling via RCA collaterals. Mid
vessel 80% lesion proximal vessel 60% lesion
RCA--Diffuse disease with serial 60% lesions (small vessel)
PCI--Overlapping stents in distal OM with normal flow, mild
thrombus, and no residual stenosis, absent collateral flow
.
[**5-22**] C Cath
Driver stents overlapping in D1
.
[**5-21**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement
with basal hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension suggestive of primary pulmonary process (pulmonary
embolism, COPD, etc.) though cannot exclude RV
ischemia/myopathy. Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo man recently discharged after stents placed in the OM1 and
D1 who presented with new onset Afib with RVR in setting of CP
and SOB.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Chest/back pain: His presentation was atypical and
longstanding.  At best, his chest pain was [**5-1**].  It worsened up
to [**8-1**] intermittently.  We evaluated his cardiac status as
below.  As it appeared to be noncardiac in origin we searched
for other causes.  He has a history of GERD as well as spinal
stenosis and atypical back pain.  We increased his prilosec to
treat for GERD.  We also increased his gabapentin to treat for
neuropathic pain.  He tolerated these interventions well.
Initially he required IV dilaudid for pain relief but with these
measures and intermittent oxycodone/APAP he had good control of
pain.
.
# SOB: This was concerning initially for cardiac ischemia.  It
was at the rehab in the setting of Afib with RVR.  Thereafter,
he only reported subjective complaints of SOB intermittently.
Evaluation with a bedside O2 monitor showed sats >91%.  We
treated with MDIs based on exam findings of wheezing and history
of smoking.  This improved his symptoms.
.
# Cards rhythm: pt received dilt gtt and amio gtt at OSH then
spontaneously converted to sinus prior to arrival in the CCU.
We discontinued these interventions.  We uptitrated his home
metoprolol and he was in sinus throughout his hospital stay.  We
also continued lovenox for anticoagulation.  TSH was normal.  We
did not suspect PE as the source of his afib as he had been
properly anticoagulated and this would not have changed our
management.
.
# Cards ischemic: no evidence of acute ischemia on these EKGs.
Recently revascularized in the OM1 and D1.  We cycled his
enzymes and he did have a troponin leak (neg CKs) which ruled
him in for an NSTEMI.  We believe this was demand ischemia from
his AFib with RVR and he was not having active ischemia once
this was corrected.  We continued his ASA, plavix, BB, and
statin.  His intermittent episodes of chest pain during his
hospitalization were not felt to be cardiac ischemia.
.
# Cards pump: recent echo with no evidence of failure.  No
evidence of failure on exam.
.
# CP/Back pain: atypical and longstanding.   He required IV
dilaudid prn initially.  We uptitrated his gabapentin and
treated with percocet with good control.
.
# C Diff: Patient had complaints of epigastric pain and loose
stools.  We checked C Diff toxin which was positive.  Flagyl was
started.  He has 12d left to complete a 14 day course.
.
# hx DVT/PE: lovenox as outpt regimen.
.
# Anemia: Hct was 26-30 per his known baseline.  He had no
episodes of melena or BRBPR.
.
# FC discussed on admit
.
# Dispo: to rehab.  He has intermittent episodes of chest pain
but serial EKGs did not suggest ischemia.  His pain is improved
with percocet and/or gabapent
