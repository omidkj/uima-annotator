HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old male
with past medical history of significant coronary artery
disease, admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**1-26**] with acute
onset of right subscapular pain and left posterior rib pain
and global weakness.  On transfer to our hospital he was
sleepy after receiving Morphine at the outside hospital so
history not entirely clear from records.  As far as we could
ascertain, patient had a right anterior chest pain and arm
pain which was positional, pleuritic in nature.  At [**Hospital6 3622**] chest x-ray showed question left lower lobe
infiltrate.  The patient was cultured.  Azithromycin was
started.  D-dimers were found to be up so CTA of the chest
was obtained which showed negative pulmonary embolus.
Lenne's were also obtained which were negative for DVT.  CKs
were cycled.  Because of his pain in the right shoulder and
some associated weakness, increased white blood cells but no
fever, concern for an epidural abscess after neurosurgical
consultation, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further work-up.  He was
initially transferred to the MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status
post CABG in [**2101**], LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1, SVG to OM1, SVG to
OM2.  Catheterization in [**2110**] showed an LV gram EF of 52%,
occluded proximal OM2, normal MV and AV.  2) Type 2 diabetes
times 8 years, recent A1C of 9.1 on insulin since [**2108**].
3) Hypercholesterolemia.  4) Peripheral vascular disease.
5) Status post cholecystectomy.  6) History of cervical
sebaceous cyst.

mg po bid, Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV q 8 hours, Flovent 2 puffs

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker, quit at 55
years old after 100 pack years, lives with his wife at home.
Usually uses a scooter for long distance walking, no alcohol,
retired investigator and police officer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 98.7, pulse
73, blood pressure 120/64, satting 100% on non rebreather,
breathing at 16.  In general he was in no apparent distress,
speaking full sentences.  HEENT unremarkable.  Lungs had
decreased breath sounds at the bases, no wheezes, crackles,
no egophony, reproducible pain, left costophrenic angle.
Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm, distant S1 and S2, no
appreciable murmur.  Abdominal exam was benign.  Back had no
CVA tenderness, no spinal tenderness.  Skin revealed a slight
rash on the back of the neck.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission were significant for white
count of 15.9, hematocrit 42, platelet count 208, Chem 7
which was remarkable only for glucose of 321.  Calcium,
magnesium and phosphorus within normal limits.  ALT, AST and
alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU.  He
was subsequently ruled out for an MI by serial enzymes.
Additionally, a CT angiogram was performed which ruled out a
PE.  There was concern for dissection since he had some back
pain but CT revealed no evidence of dissection.  Because of
his tenderness in his left rib, the CT was later reviewed by
the staff radiologist and it was noted that he had [**2-12**] left
rib fractures.  On further questioning, the patient and his
wife state he had been coughing vigorously on the days prior
to admission.  The suspicion of the team was that he coughed
so significantly he broke his ribs.  We had no other
explanation for the fracture since he denied a history of
trauma at all.  He was transferred out of the ICU and taken
to the floor where he required oxygen for supplementation.
We believe this was secondary to a possible pneumonia
although chest x-ray was not indicative of an infiltrate and
the pain from his rib fractures inhibiting his deep
inspiration.  Additionally it was noted that the patient had
a slight rash on the back of his neck.  Because of this, he
was covered with Dicloxacillin for possible cellulitis and
continued on Levaquin for possible pneumonia.  On [**1-31**] the
patient was noted to be hypotensive.  Review of his I's and
O's showed he had been negative approximately a liter each
day prior.  Chem 7 was checked which revealed an elevated BUN
and creatinine consistent with prerenal azotemia.  The
patient was bolused with several 500 cc normal saline boluses
and put on IV fluids overnight.  He subsequently began to
increase his urine output and his blood pressure returned to
[**Location 213**] which is approximately 110/80.  At the time of this
dictation the plan was to arrange for him to be transferred
back to the hospital from which he came under the care of his
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient and his wife would like
this as it is closer to their home.  Additionally, we think
this makes sense since his only remaining issues are
treatment of his infection.  He does have an elevated white
count of approximately 15 at the time of discharge and pain
control to improve his oxygen requirements.
