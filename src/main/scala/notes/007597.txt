History of Present Illness:
89 y.o male with DM, ?CHF/CAD, moderate MR, HLD reports that
since lifting a heavy item into a dumster last Wednedsay (2 days

.
[**Last Name (un) **] 1 min of arrival and 40 min of sxs, by report patient had a

debrillator placed and rhythm changed into afib with RVR without
intervention. Patient does not recall events but apparently had
1-3 minutes of chest compressions. Wife notes that there was a
lot of commotion and he was unconscious for a short perior of

(guess fo 60kg). Bolus heparin 4000 U. Plavix 600mg given in
cath lab here at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In cath lab, noted to have a totally occluded mid RCA,
thrombectomy with improved flow and BMS placed. Was given
diltiazem 1mg centrally after procedure when had a "wide complex
tachycardia" and AF broke. Right groin sheath was pulled. Pain
free now. Other coronaries with mild disease.  Did right heart
cath at end and PA pressure 30. PA diastolic <15, RA pressures
NL.

IMAGING/STUDIES:

C.Cath [**2173-10-29**]:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. ST elevation myocardial infarction with occlusion of the mid
RCA.
3. Successful export thrombectomy and PCI of the mid RCA with
BMS (see
PTCA comments).

CXR Portable [**2173-10-29**]:
FINDINGS: No rib fractures identified and there is no
pneumothorax. The
heart is mildly increased in size and there is volume loss at
both bases but there is no overt pulmonary edema. Compared to
the prior study from [**2170**] there is improved aeration in the left
lower lobe and the heart size is mildly increased.
.
TTE [**2173-10-30**]: LVEF: 30%
The left atrium is normal in size.. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. LV systolic function
appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to
extensive severe inferior posterior and lateral wall
hypokinesis/akinesis; the posterior wall is dyskinetic. The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is
