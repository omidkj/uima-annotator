Imaging:
CT OSH [**2193-5-5**]: large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, tracking
into ventricles, with leftward MLS 17mm and subfalcine
herniation; possible brain stem hemorrhage as well.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo man with PMH significant for HTN who presents with large
intracerebral hemorrhage with intraventricular extension
admitted with signs of herniation. His neurologic exam on
admission was notable for coma with loss of pupillary and
oculocephalic reflexes, with preserved corneal and gag reflexes.
Options were discussed with the family and it was determined (in
conjunction with the neurosurgery service) that surgical
intervention was not desired. He was admitted to the neurology
ICU. The patient's ICU course was complicated by probable
development of DI, with urine output of one liter over one hour.
He received treatment with DDAVP and fluid replacement. In the
meantime, deliberations continued among the family about goals
of care and whether to initiate comfort measures. Family
meetings involving the patient's wife, sons, as well as other
relatives and friends, took place involving the house staff,
social worker, and nurse.

On [**2193-5-7**] in the morning, Mr. [**Known lastname 73345**] was noted to have a
rapidly falling blood pressure. He was started on multiple
pressors but was not able to regain a viable blood pressure.
Within approximately 30 minutes, he had a cardiac arrest and
died. His son was at the bedside. The rest of the family was
called. His wife declined autopsy.
