Service:  [**Year (4 digits) **]'s Purple

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Barrett's esophagus.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 78 year old
male who initially complained of left upper quadrant pain
that was intermittent and continuous throughout the night and
day for about six months.  He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54237**] who
performed an endoscopy in [**2164-10-22**].  The results of
that study reveals Barrett's esophagus with high-grade
dysplasia and question of invasive adenocarcinoma by readings
of two expert pathologists.  This patient had not complained
of any weight loss but has an outstanding history of
gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms for about 20+ years.
He now presents for surgical management of his esophageal
cancer.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
4.  Echocardiogram in [**2164-9-22**] which showed ejection
fraction of 50% with normal myocardial function.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Proscar 5 mg q. day
2.  Synthroid 150 mcg q. day
3.  Norvasc 5 mg q. day.
4.  Aspirin
5.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day
6.  Zestril 40 mg q. day
7.  Toprol 50 mg q. day
8.  Protonix 40 mg q. day
9.  TUMS

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preoperatively the patient's vital
signs were as follows, blood pressure 151/51, heart rate 59,
saturation rate 93% on room air.
GENERAL:  In no acute distress.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Soft, nondistended, mildly tender left
upper quadrant.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient underwent an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
esophagogastrectomy on [**2165-1-29**].  The patient tolerated
the procedure well and there were no immediate postoperative
complications, please see the operative note for further
details.  Before closure of the operation, a chest tube was
placed in the right chest wall, and the jejunostomy tube was
also placed for feeding purposes.  The patient's pain was
well controlled with a Bupivacaine epidural.  A follow up
chest x-ray demonstrated that the chest tube was in the
correct position.  On postoperative day #1, the patient's
epidural was discontinued and the patient was successfully
pushed over to Dilaudid for pain control.  On postoperative
day #2, the patient's tube feedings were started at 20 cc/hr.
On postoperative day #2, the patient's nasogastric tube fell
out, and was replaced under fluoroscopy.  On postoperative
day #3, the patient's medications were switched over to p.o.
form.  The patient was also given some Lasix for diuresis.
On postoperative day #4, the patient's upper gastrointestinal
study was also obtained.  This study demonstrated some
retention of contrast after a series of imagings.  This was
believed to be consistent with possible obstruction.  On the
evening of postoperative day #4, it was noted that the
patient began having some mental status changes, pulling at
the patient's tubes.  A sitter was ordered and surgical
intern was also asked to evaluate this patient.  It is also
noted that the patient began having low oxygen saturations
and had been requiring increasing oxygen via facemask for
close to 24 hours.  The patient also began having shortness
of breath.  His tube feeds were discontinued and a stat
arterial blood gases, electrocardiogram and chest x-ray were
obtained.  Senior residents were called for further
assistance.  The arterial blood gas revealed 7.33 pH, pCO2
74, pO2 of 85.  It was evident that the patient was going
into respiratory failure and Anesthesia was also called for
intubation of this patient.  This was done successfully, and
the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
further care.  On postoperative day #6, the patient remained
bradycardiac and hypertensive.  Hydralazine was given for
blood pressure control.  The chest x-ray during this period
revealed left-sided effusion and consolidation, which was
consistent with either an aspiration pneumonia or hypercarbic
metabolic alkalosis respiratory failure.  Sputum culture
revealed gram negative diplococci and gram negative rods.  On
postoperative day #6, the patient was started on
Levofloxacin.  He was also given Diamox to attempt reversal
of his metabolic alkalosis.  On postoperative day #8, the
patient's pO2 remained low.  The patient was transfused 1
unit of packed red blood cells to help oxygenation.  His tube
feeds were also restarted.  On postoperative day #9, the
patient demonstrated slow improvement.  There was no
Staphylococcus aureus growing in the sputum.  He was slowly
weaned off of Propofol.  His tubes were increased and
advanced.  The patient was also started on Vancomycin to
cover the Staphylococcus aureus.  Throughout the patient's
Intensive Care Unit stay the patient demonstrated difficulty
weaning off intubation.  He was continued with chest physical
therapy and frequent suctioning.  He was also given Lasix for
diuresis.  The patient remained otherwise stable.  He
tolerated his tube feeds.

On postoperative day #15, the patient's antibiotics were
changed from Levofloxacin to Zosyn.  On postoperative day #6,
the patient's chest tube was removed.  After a prolonged
intubation, the patient was finally extubated on [**2165-2-16**] which was postoperative day #18.  Diuresis, pulmonary
toilet and chest physical therapy were all continued.  On
postoperative day #20, the patient's nasogastric tube was
discontinued.  The patient's metabolic alkalosis was
ultimately improved with a hydrochloride drip.  The patient
was finally transferred to the floor on [**2165-2-20**].  The
patient remained slow to wake up mentally.  The TSH level was
determined to be elevated.  The Synthroid dose was increased
from 150 mcg to 175 mcg.  On postoperative day #24, the
patient was discontinued on Zosyn.  A peripheral intravenous
line was placed and his central venous line was discontinued.
The patient had some loose stools and a Clostridium difficile
was drawn.  These returned negative for any Clostridium
difficile toxin. Due to his slow but gradual progress
mentally, a behavioral neurology consult was obtained.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] had recommended improving his wake/sleep cycles with
Trazodone 50 q.h.s. and Ritalin 5 mg q. AM.  This seemed to
improve the patient's wake/sleep cycle, and the patient made
again slow progress from a neurologic standpoint.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
had also suspected a possible hypoxic injury due to the
patient's respiratory failure during the hospitalization.  He
recommended an magnetic resonance imaging scan which was
ordered.  However, this magnetic resonance imaging scan was
not tolerated by the patient.  It was felt that the patient
would do best at a [**Hospital 13623**] Rehabilitation.

A physical therapy and occupational therapy consult were
obtained.  The patient's Zosyn antibiotic was discontinued
after 14 days.  At the time of this dictation, the patient
was planned for discharge to [**Hospital1 **].  Further addendum will
be necessary once discharge is finalized.
