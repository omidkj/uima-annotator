CTA

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 89 yo woman with PMH sig for CAD s/p MI and HTN as well
as partial colonic resection for polyp who presents as a Code
Stroke after being found aphasic by her family.  She was last
seen well ~2 pm (6 hours before arrival) and was without
complaint [**Last Name **] problem at the time.  She was then found by her
family sitting at home unable to speak.

On arrival, her FS was 168.  She was awake, nearly mute and
followed occasional simple commands.  She initially had mild
weakness of the right side, but this worsened between exams in
the ED.  Emergent head CT showed some loss of the left insular
ribbon.  She was outside of the 6 hour iaTpa window.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI
s/p partial colectomy for polyp(adenoma w/high grade dysplasia)
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
Osteoarthritis
Diverticulitis

Social History:
Pt lives in area. Her family is closely involved.

.
Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, aphasic, so semi-cooperative
with exam
Orientation: Unable
Pt could not repeat. No meaningful verbal output, she mumbled
garbled speech.  She could follow 1 step commands, but not two
step well.
Unable to further assessment MS as a result
.
Cranial Nerves:
I: not tested
II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 3 mm
bilaterally. BTT on right, but possible left homonymous
hemianopsia(difficult to tell based on exam)
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally without
nystagmus.
V, VII: Facial strength and sensation intact and symmetric,
except mild right NLF flattening.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
IX, X: + gag
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: Trapezius normal bilaterally.
XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations
.
Motor:
Normal bulk and tone bilaterally.  No tremor. Pt initially had
no drift and apparent full strength on the left (somewhat
limited by cooperation).  On the right, she was initially able
to hold up UE and LE for 10 seconds with some drift.  On re-eval
after CT, she had worsened, with inability to hold LE up and
significant drift of her UE.  Formal testing not possible given
her poor cooperation.
.
Sensation: Pt would not acknowledge LT throughout but did
grimace to nox stim in all exts.  Some w/d on right, but minimal
on left.
.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ankle
Right     1 1 t  1   0
Left      1 1 t  1   0
.
Toes were mute on left, up on right.
.
Coordination: Would not cooperate with any testing
.
Gait: Not tested

MRI:
1. Extremely limited study due to claustrophobia and motion.
2. No mass effect/hydrocephalus/midline shift.
3. Diffusion-weighted images not available to assess for acute
stroke.
.
CTA brain/neck : Large infarction in the distribution of the
left middle cerebral artery. No filling defects seen in the CTA
images of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
.
CT perfusion:     A large area of increased mean transit time
and decreased cerebral blood flow is present in the left frontal
and parietal lobes consistent with infarction in the
distribution of the superior and inferior divisions of the left
middle cerebral artery.
.
CTA Chest:
1.  Study is somewhat limited due to respiratory motion.
Allowing for this,
no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Multiple 2- to 3-mm nodules within the lung parenchyma.
Followup
dedicated CT scan within 1 year's time is recommended.
3.  Right adrenal myelolipoma.
4.  Low-density segment 2 left liver lobe lesion incompletely
characterized.
Correlation with ultrasound or MRI is recommended if clinically
indicated.
5.  Dense atherosclerosis.
.
EEG:
ABNORMALITY #1: Low voltage delta frequency slowing was seen
persistently in the left central and posterior temporal region.
ABNORMALITY #2: A slow and disorganized background reaching a
maximum frequency of 7 Hz was seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMALITY #3: Generalized delta frequency slowing with an
occasional bifrontal predominance was seen.
BACKGROUND: See abnormality #2.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to acute stroke.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: No normal transitions from wakefulness to sleep were
seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A regular rhythm with an average heart rate of
78 bpm was noted.
IMPRESSION: This was an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence
of focal slowing in the left centrotemporal region, indicative
of dysfunction of the subcortical structures in that region. The
slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized
slowing suggest a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
.
TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No right-to-left passage of
microbubbles is
identified at rest. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
 .
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic regurgitation with mild aortic valve
sclerosis. No
discrete vegetation or definite cardiac source of embolism
identified.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:  Pt. was found to have a large L MCA infarct on CT
perfusion (see results above).  She continued to have global
aphasia and R hemiparesis throughout admission. TTE was
performed and showed no evidence of cardiac source of thrombus.
Lipid panel was checked and Lescol was increased as lipids were
above goal.  She was evaluated by speech and swallow, who felt
that she would need a PEG for long term nutrition.  This was
discussed with her family, who felt that she would not want such
an invasive procedure and said that they would want her care to
focus on comfort.
.
Pulmonary:  Pt. was noted to have stridor on exam and was
tachypneic on the floor to the 40s.  She was transferred to the
ICU for close monitoring.  CTA Chest was performed and showed no
evidence of PE.  She was seen by Pulmonary, who felt that she
most likely had laryngeal edema causing her symptoms.  She was
evaluated by ENT who confirmed supraglottic edema, and she was
treated with racemic epinephrine and a Decadron pulse with
improvement in her respiratory status.
.
CV:  Pt. was noted to go into a HR of 140s-160s intermittently
on the floor.  She was controlled with Metoprolol.

Goals of Care:  Per the patient's previously stated wishes, her
family decided to pursue comfort care only.  She has been
comfortable with occasional doses of sublingual morphine for
respiratory effort/agitation. She will be discharged to
Lighthouse for continued hospice care.
