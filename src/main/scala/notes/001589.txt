History of Present Illness:
79 yo F with hx of DM2, HTN, Ao Stenosis s/p AVR and now has
bioprothetic AS and pacemaker (complete heart block w/100%

CXR [**2125-9-3**]:
FINDINGS: There is a left-sided pacemaker with leads ending at
the right
atrium and right ventricle. There are intact sternal wires.
There is mild
cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema without evidence of large
pleural
effusions. There is calcification of the aortic arch and the
mitral annulus
as well as of the trachea. There is no pneumothorax or focal
consolidation.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2125-9-4**]:
FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes. There is mild
cardiomegaly, stable. A  dual-lead pacemaker is unchanged. There
has been interval improvement in pulmonary edema with minimal
interstitial opacities and blunting of the
costophrenic angles. Severely calcified mitral annulus is noted.
No focal
consolidation or pneumothorax.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo F with hx of DM2, HTN, Aortic Stenosis s/p AVR and now has
bioprosthetic critical AS and pacemaker presenting on admission
from wards floor with acute respiratory distress and flash
pulmonary edema.
.
# Pulmonary Edema/diastolic CHF: Patient has a history of
multiple CHF exacerbation admissions in the past. On this
admission, patient reportedly missed PM medications (lasix) and
received some IVF when she was being admitted for episode of
hypoglycemia. She was found by nursing after transfer to the
wards floor to be in respiratory distress, and CXR showed BL
flash pulmonary edema, hypertensive to sBP200s, and ABG
7.30/55/63/28.  She was placed on BiPAP, morphine, Hydralizine
IVx1, Lasix IV40mg, and transferred to the CCU.  Troponins were
0.01->0.02->0.05. She was diuresed with IV lasix, then
transitioned to home Lasix, and her respiratory status improved
to baseline.  On discharge, the patient was oxygenating well on
room air.
.
# Hypertension: On transfer to the CCU, patient was found to
have sBP in 200s.  When remeasured, had L arm sBP 207 and R arm
sBP 106, however, history of BL subclavian stenosis (R-80%;
L-40%) therfore opted not to get CT to check for aortic
dissection; CXR did not show evidence of dissection/widened
mediastinum. She had received hydralizine 20mg IV prior to
transfer. Her home medications were reconciled with her
pharmacy, and she was placed on Valsartan 120mg [**Hospital1 **] and
Carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her home nifidipine and hydralizine were
held since her BP was well controlled with a range of
106-135/40-53, and concern for afterload reduction in critical
AS.
.
# Ao Stenosis: patient has hx of critical bioprosthetic AS s/p
AVR [**2118**].  According to TTE of [**3-22**] and [**1-23**]: patient has high
transvalvular gradient and valve area of 0.7. No further ECHOS
have been done, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as patient will not proceed
with any intervention anyway.  Discussed with patient and
family, and confirmed that she would not like to pursue surgical
correction. Therefore, no ECHO or pre-operative evaluation was
performed on this admission.
.
# Diabetes: patient originally presented with low blood sugars
to the 60s and LOC. Typically on Lantus 35U at home, and Lispro.
In the hospital, she was started on Lantus 20U and insulin
sliding scale to estimate her insulin requirements. Her final
Lantus dose at discharge was titrated at 23U in addition to ISS.
 She will be discharged on this regimen, in addition to Lispro
for extra mealtime coverage.

# CAD s/p CABG: Patient has known long-standing disease CAD.
CABG x 1 with SVG to PDA in [**2118**], PCI to LAD [**2119**]. Recent flash
pulmonary less concerning for possible ischemic event, CE normal
range and no associate CP.  She was continued
