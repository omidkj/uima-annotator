Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34384**] was admitted to the TICU under the care of the
Interventional Pulmonary Team on [**2119-4-19**].  He had a CT trachea
done which showed TBM, with the stent in place but with moderate
to severe malacia distal to the stent in the main bronchi.
Compared to his previous CT, the stent demonstrated decreased
amount of stenosis.  The next day he underwent bronchoscopy with
IP, and had some granulation tissue removed and sent to
pathology.  The stent was then removed and replaced with a
longer stent.  He had some mild post procedure bleeding, which
was evaluated with bronchoscopy that showed a clot behind the
stent.  This was managed conservatively with close observation
(Hct remained stable, no transfusions were required), and he had
no more episodes of bleeding.  He was rebronched on PPD#1 [**4-21**].
He continued to do well without any issues.  By PPD#2 and 3, he
was weaned to trach mask for most of the day, with no
respiratory issues.  On PPD#3, he is afebrile, AVSS, tolerating
tube feeds at goal, and he will be discharged to home with trach
mask during the day, ventilator at night, with f/u with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**7-2**] weeks.
