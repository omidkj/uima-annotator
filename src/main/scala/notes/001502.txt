Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo female with DM2, bipolar, schizopphrenia, found down on
floor at nursing home and transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. Here, found to be
obtunded, LP and exam consistent with meningoencephalitis.
.
1. Mental status changes- Pt with obtundation and evidence of
decordicate posturing and hypereflexia on initial exam. It was
also remarkable for clonus/myoclonus of lower/upper extremities
with upgoing Babinskis. She also had a right visual field gaze
preference and also questionable left sided neglect. DDx
initially included a seizure vs. a post-ictal state vs.
meningoencephalitis. LP done in the ED showed 19 WBC in tube 4
with normal protein and slightly elevated glucose. It was not
consistent with a bacterial picture except for the neutrophilic
predominance. Rather, a viral etiology was thought to be more
likely (early viral can have a neutrophilic predominance) or
listeria. Pt was empirically covered with Vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, bactrim (PCN allergy and wanted to cover for
listeria), and acyclovir and on precautions. EEG showed severe
encephalopathy and MRI showed meningeal enhancement meningeal
enhancement consistent with meningitis. Possibly some findings
in the occipital lobe suggesting encephalitis. No evidence of
focal mass or hemorrhage. As cultures for both bacteria and for
HSV came back negative the antibiotics were discontinued. WNV,
EEE virus cultures are still pending but a postive result would
not change treatment at this point, especially as the patient
has improved significantly. She has been competely afebrile,
alert + oriented X 3, and her WBCs have normalized.
.
2. Leukocytosis/Pleocytosis- Likely secondary to CNS infection
as above. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Pt continued
to have a leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance although
becoming more lymphocytic, consistent with an aseptic
meningitis. The leukocytosis resolved completely prior to
discharge.
.
3. Acid/Base- Initially with a mixed respiratory alkalosis/anion
gap acidosis with underlying alkalosis. This normalized while
the patient was still in the ICU (see below). Her acid base
status was normal thorughout the rest of her hospitalization,
and at discharge.
.
a). Respiratory alkalosis- This was attributable to
encephalitic/neurological process occuring, and resolved with
clearing of her mental status.
.
b). Anion gap acidosis- Initially with AGA likely ketoacidosis
from starvation vs. less likely DKA given pt type II. Gap
decreased to 13 with fluids and resolved.
.
c). Metabolic alkalosis-Likely secondary to volume depletion in
setting of HCTZ as well. We held her diuretics and gave her
fluids and this resolved. Given her hyponatremia and tendency to
hyperkalemia, we restarted her lsiinopril and started her on
lasix 10mg po QOD to keep her K down while not causing
hyponatremia. She is discharged without HCTZ.
.
4. Increased CK/Chronic Renal Failure- This was secondary to
being found down/trauma. CK peaked ~1000 and trended down. Pt
was given IVF which helped bring down her CK but worsened her
hyponatremia (see below). Patient's BUN/Cr actually lower than
her usual baseline. Ck has been normalizing throughout her stay,
and is down to 254 on discharge.
.
5. Hyponatremia & hyper kalemia: Pt has appeared to be euvolemic
since time of initial presentation. In the differential we
considered thyroid vs. polydipsia vs. SIADH. Serum and urine
osmolalities were 270 and 383 respectively, pointing more
towards an SIADH like picture. We did a trial of NS hydration to
see if pt was intravascularly dry, but sodium decreased from 125
to 121. Pt was then fluid restricted and medications
concentrated for likely SIADH [**12-28**] encephalopathic process. This
resolved as the patient's mental status resolved. Her sodium
stabilized at a normal value of 133, 134 for 4 days prior to
discharge. Given her low sodium, she is not on HCTZ at this
time. However her K began to rise. Therefore she has been
started on lasix 10mg po QOD to keep her K down without dropping
Na. She should ha
