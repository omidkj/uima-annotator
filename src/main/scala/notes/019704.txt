Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
Cholangitis -> transfer for ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2125**], CHF, AF on coumadin,
T2DM, obesity, ESRD on HD, who initially presented on [**8-18**] to
[**Hospital3 **] with N/V and fever/chills after HD and was found to
have cholangitis and cholelithiasis. The patient had been
experiencing intermiteent n/v for the last 2 mo following
dialysis, as well as after eating.  The pt reports decreased POs
during this time.  After HD on [**8-18**], the patient experienced
additional n/v with RUQ abd pain, and was taken to the OSH ED
for evaluation.
.
In the ED at OSH, his T 102.6 with BP 110/76 initially.  Labs
were notable for Tbili 5.7, AP 800, [**Doctor First Name **] 213 and INR 5.8 (given
vit K).  RUQ showed cholelithiasis with CBD 2.5cm.  Pt
subsequently became hypotensive to the 80s sytolic and was
started on dopamine, switched to levophed, as well as empiric
Vanco/Zosyn for presumed cholangitis.  He was transferred to the
ICU for further monitoring.  In the ICU, a LIJ and RSC line were
placed (under sterile conditions).  On [**8-19**] he underwent ERCP
showing a 10mm stone in the distal CBD.  Stent was successfully
placed (spincterotomy was deferred given oozing from site and
coagulopathy for which he received 3 units FFP).  Post ERCP he
developed pancreatitis (Lip >10K, [**Doctor First Name **] 2K).  His [**Doctor First Name **]/Lip
subsequently trended down, and his LFTs/Tbili remained unchaged
from admission.  His INR also trended down to 1.5.  He underwent
HD on [**2128-8-20**].  TTE showed EF 60% with dilated RA/RV with RV
systolic dysfxn.  However, given the need for further
intervention he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for sphicterotomy.  On
transfer, he was still on levophed at 2-3mcg/min, vanco/zosyn,
with negative cultures to date and stable VS.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, the patient reported feeling well.
He reported mild RUQ abd pain, but no CP, SOB, nausea.  He was
awake and alert.
.

Imaging:

1. Extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No calculi
visualized in the limited evaluation of the common bile duct.
2. Cholelithiasis, no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
3. Coarse liver echotexture.

Abd CT from OSH: dilated CBD at 2.5cm, cholelithiasis, adrena
adenoma, fatty infiltration of liver, small bowel diverticula
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  The estimated right atrial pressure is >20
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.

ERCP:
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: A plastic stent placed in the biliary duct was
found in the major papilla. The stent was in good position and
was draining bile.
Biliary Tree: A single 10mm stone that was causing partial
obstruction was seen at the upper third of the common bile duct.

Otherwise the common bile duct, common hepatic duct were
partially filled with contrast and appeared normal. Given
suspicion of cholangitis, fully opacification of the biliary
tree was not performed.
Procedures: A plastic stent was removed.
A 8cm by 10fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully
using a Oasis system stent introducer kit.
Impression: Stent in the major papilla - this was removed.
Stone in the bile duct, otherwise limited cholangiogram.
A biliary stent was inserted.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67 M with CAD s/p CABG, Afib, DM2, ESRD on HD, with
cholangitis/cholelithiasis with gallstone in CBD, pancreatitis,
hypotension, transferred from OSH for repeat ERCP and definitive
management.
.
1) Cholelithiasis/Cholangitis: The patient presented with
fevers/chills, RUQ pain, jaundice consistent with cholangitis.
Found to have gallstone in distal CBD.  He underwent stenting at
[**Hospital6 **] with good bile flow.  His fevers improved as
did his LFTs.  He was transferred here for repeat ERCP.  He
underwent ERCP on [**8-24**].  The original stent was replaced with
larger stent but a sphincterotomy was not performed because of
the patient's coagulopathy.  On presentation he was placed on
vancomycin and zosyn for empiric antibiotic coverage and prior
to leaving MICU his vancomycin was discontinued.  All blood
cultures here were negative.  His LFTs continued to trend down.
  He will undero repeat ERCP and elective sphincterotomy as an
outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 2568**] (in several weeks vs. with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] here once his inflammation has improved.  He
is scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] here for [**10-28**] at 8AM.  Will need
to be off coumadin at least 5 days in case of need of
sphincterotomy.  Got 7 days of zosyn and 4 days of cipro/flagyl,
should have 3 more days of c
