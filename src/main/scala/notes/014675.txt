History of Present Illness:
68 year old Cantonese speaking male with no known significant
past medical history who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2189-1-17**]
for acute stroke at 13:40.

Patient was last seen well at 12:30pm on [**2189-1-17**]. Per his wife,
he went outside to smoke a cigarette. When he did not return
after 10-15 minutes, she went out to look for him. Found him
slumped on ground. Per her report, he was awake but not
following commands and not verbally responsive. She did note him
to move all extremities. EMS notified. Patient brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
En route, EKG showed atrial fibrillation. ED notified of
possible stroke at 13:30, prior to patient's arrival. Code
Stroke called; neurology resident in room prior to the patient's
arrival.

Patient arrived to ED at 13:40. On NIHSS exam, not keenly alert,
but responsive to noxious stimuli. No verbal output. Not
following commands. Noted to have left gaze preference.
Flattening of left nasolabial fold. Not initially moving left
side, but later noted to move these against gravity. Triple
flexion response in right LE and extensor posturing in right UE.
Patient had shallow respirations in ED and so was intubated for
airway protection.

Went to CT scan at 13:55. No acute hemorrhage identified but
dense left MCA sign. CTA shortly thereafter with occlusion left
MCA, evolving hypodensity entire left MCA territory. Given tPA
after consent obtained from family at 14:40. Dose based on
estimated weight of 60 kg; given 53.2 total with 5.3 bolus dose.

Patient had no improvement in strength after t-PA.  His mental
status exam was clouded by sedative medications.  Additionally,
patient was given 20mg of IV labetolol for DBP 110 and
subsequently dropped SBP to 60's.  Was started on dopamine gtt
for blood pressure support via PIV (central line contraindicated
after t-PA).

Past Medical History:
None, patient did not attend regular medical appointments.  PCP
is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Location (un) 583**]. Last saw him a few months ago for flu
vaccine and had normal physical per family.

alcohol or drug use.

Mental status: No verbal output. Grimaced to noxious stimuli.
Would not respond to commands over telephone by Chinese
interpreter.

Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2 to
1 mm bilaterally. Patient will not keep eyes open, so unable to
assess visual fields. Unable to appreciate fundi. Eyes intially
left deviated at rest. +Doll's, crossed midline. Slight
flattening of right nasolabial fold. Hearing intact to finger
rub bilaterally. +Gag. Tongue midline without fasciculations.

Motor: Normal bulk and tone. Initially did not withdraw left
side to noxious stimuli, but later moved left arm and leg
spontaneously against gravity. Right lower extremity externally
rotated. Had triple flexion response of RLE to noxious. Extensor
posturing of RUE to noxious. No antigravity on right side. No
adventious movements, tremors.

Sensation: Triple flexion response of RLE to noxious. Extensor
posture of RUE to noxious. Left side did not initially withdraw,
but did so on reexamination.

Pertinent Results:

Na 141  K 5.5 (hemolyzed)  Cl 107  HCO3 27  BUN 16  Cr 1.3
Cardiac enzymes neg.  UA lg blood, RBC [**2-21**]

CTA brain [**2189-1-17**]:  Findings consistent with a thromboembolic
stroke involving the left middle cerebral artery. No evidence of
hemorrhage.

CXR: Cardiomegaly and prominence of the interstitial markings
suggests pulmonary vascular congestion. No effusion.

TTE: Mild global biventricular hypokinesis without regional
dysfunction. EF 45%. Trace aortic regurgitation. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a  trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. Recommend SBE prophylaxis.

Carotid US: Normal carotids and vertebrals.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU following IV administration of
t-PA 2 hours and 10 minutes after his stroke.  He sustained a
relatively large left MCA stroke, likely secondary to
thromboembolism as he was found to be in atrial fibrillation (a
new diagnosis).

Initially he had some bloody NGT output, but this cleared with
lavage and his HCT remained stable.  No complications from t-PA;
head CT the next day showed no gross hemorrhage. Initially he
required pressors (dopamine, then neosynephrine) in the ICU for
BP support as he was given labetolol in the ED. He was extubated
the day after admisison.

Exam off sedation:  awake, alert, not following commands in his
native tongue, no verbal output (globally aphasic), right face
droop, possibly has a right visual field defect, does blink
bilaterally, right hemiplegia but does withdraw right leg to
noxious stimuli.  Right arm continues to extensor posture with
pain. Tone increased on the right with hyperreflexia.

He failed swallow evaluation. Thus PEG tube was placed on
[**2189-1-20**].

For the atrial fibrillation he was started on metoprolol for
rate control. Heart rate still needs monitoring to ensure
adequate rate control at current metoprolol dosing; he may need
diltiazem added.  After PEG placed, he was started on coumadin
for secondary stroke prophylaxis, though he was not loaded with
coumadin given the large size of his stroke. Goal INR [**1-22**].  His
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Location (un) 583**], agreed to follow his INR upon
discharge from rehab.

LDL elevated at 110, thus statin therapy was initiated. Carotid
ultrasound normal.

HBA1c was elevated at 6.3.  Glucose was controlled during
admission with RISS.  He should have the possible diagnosis of
diabetes explored with PCP.

TTE showed biventricular hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  He
should be started on an ACEI when BP allows, and have an
outpatient stress test.  ** Needs endocarditis ppx prior to
dental procedures per TTE report. **

He developed a leukocytosis, but this resolved and CXR was
negative for infiltrates.

On discharge, he still had a global aphasia and dense right
hemiplegia with no spontaneous movement of right side.
