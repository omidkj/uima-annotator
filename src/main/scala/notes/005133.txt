History of Present Illness:
61M w/ hx of longstanding dementia and Parkinsonism as well
as a chronically incarcerated L inguinoscrotal hernia presents
today to NEBH after an episode of coffee-ground emesis that
resulted in subsequent desaturation and concern for aspiration
afterward. The patient is apparently nonverbal, holds his tongue

in continuous protrusion, and has had no further emesis. He
presented with a distended abdomen and plain films that were
concerning for a sbo with dilated, ladder-like loops of small
bowel. Based on this presentation a surgeon at the OSH prepared

to take this patient to the operating room, but anesthesia
concern for the patient's airway prompted txfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

DIAGNOSIS:
Small bowel, excision:
1.  Small intestinal segment with mucosal ischemic change,
submucosal edema, serosal adhesions, and transmural acute
inflammation.
2.  Margins of small intestinal segment with focal transmural
acute inflammation, mucosal ischemic change, and serosal
adhesion formation.

Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 89187**]  Small Bowel.
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Terminal ileum, resection (A-B):
Small intestinal segment with focal transmural necrosis and
diffuse mucosal ischemic change and serosal adhesions; margins
of resection demonstrate mucosal ischemia without transmural
involvement.
II.  Soft tissue, left inguinal region (C-D):
Fibroadipose tissue with hemorrhage and reactive mesothelial
lining consistent with hernial sac.

[**2193-5-20**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. High-grade, likely early small-bowel obstruction appears
secondary to a
bowel-containing left inguinal hernia, as detailed above. There
is also a
bowel-containing right inguinal hernia, which contains
decompressed distal
ileum, and does not appear to represent additional site of
obstruction at this time. There is no evidence of bowel
ischemia.
2. Renal cysts, with additional cortically based hypodensity
likely
representing additional cysts though too small to characterize
on the left.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2193-5-21**]**

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2193-5-21**]):
      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.

[**2193-5-29**] CXR :
The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip at
least in the
duodenum. The patient is in interstitial pulmonary edema that
appears to be increased since the prior study. There is also
worsening of the right basal consolidation as well as right
upper lung more rounded opacities that might represent
underlying infectious process. Bilateral pleural effusions are
present, their size is difficult to evaluate on this portable
study. Apices cannot be evaluated since patient's chin is
obscuring lung apices.

[**2193-5-30**] CXR :
1. Satisfactory placement of left upper extremity PICC.
2. Interval resolution of pneumonia and right lower lobe
atelectasis since
[**2193-5-29**].
3. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and moderately large
left pleural effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
On the day of admission the patient was taken promptly to the OR
for exlap. Frank stool seen throughout abdomen. There were
multiple areas of microperforation and leaking stool, SB was
resected and he was left in discontinuity with an open abdomen
as he became labile intraoperatively. The following day, he was
taken back to the OR for rising bladder pressures overnight.
Small bowel was resected and reanastamosed. The abdomen was left
open as there was a loss of domain. He tolerated surgery well.
On [**5-22**] he was volume overloaded with low urine outputs so he was
diuresed with good response. His pressor requirement was
decreasing. On [**5-23**] he was taken back to the OR for closure of
the abdominal wall with vicryl mesh and placement of a VAC over
the vicryl mesh. He did have oliguria and was given albumin and
lasix with good response. On [**5-24**], he was extubated. On [**5-25**], the
Parkinson's meds were restarted. Tube feeds were continued. On
[**5-26**], he was given free water flushes for hypernatremia. Also, he
was having persistent elevated tubefeed residuals. He was
manually disimpacted with good effect. On [**5-27**], the VAC was
changed at the bedside. He was transfered to the floor in stable
condition.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his nasogastric tube
was removed in preparation for a swallow evaluation.
Unfortunately he failed the study with minimal response to food
being placed in his mouth.  Subsequently he was taken to
Interventional Radiology for placement of a Dobbhoff feeding
tube. Two other attempts were made at swallow studies as became
more responsive and communicative but he failed all trials.  He
remains on full tube feedings with a post pyloric Dobbhoff
feeding tube.

He developed some shortness of breath and increased congestion
on [**2193-5-29**] and a subsequent Chest Xray revealed some CHF with
right upper and right lower lobe consolidations.  He improved
with diuresis but due to his Xray appearance he was also placed
on Vancomycin and Cefepime for pneumonia.  His Vancomycin trough
was 20 on [**2193-6-5**] which reflected 1 Gm daily.  Currently his
Vancomycin is being dosed at 1 Gm. every other day and he will
need a trough on [**2193-6-8**] prior to his dose. From a respiratory
standpoint his oxygen saturations are 95% on room air and his
congestion has resolved.  His WBC is 9K and he remains afebrile.
His antibiotics will continue thru [**2193-6-20**].

His abdominal wound is quite extensive but doing well with VAC
therapy.  White sponges cover the vicryl mesh followed by black
sponges.  The VAC was changed on [**2193-6-5**] and is changed every 3
days.  He sometimes requires mild pain medication prior to VAC
changes.

After a long protracted stay he was transferred to rehab on
[**2193-6
