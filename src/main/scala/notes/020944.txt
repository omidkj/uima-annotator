Service:  Medicine [**Hospital1 139**] Firm

Dicharge Date:  To be determined, this dictation summary is
from [**2160-3-5**] through [**2160-3-23**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
male with a history of COPD, asthma, cor pulmonale,
hypertension, congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 35%, coronary artery disease with a history of a
MI, and hepatitis C virus, who presented to an outside
hospital ([**Hospital1 1562**]) with increased shortness of breath,
expectoration of sputum, and wheezing.  Patient had a recent
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and was then sent to a
rehab facility for rehabilitation.

He returned to the hospital with increasing shortness of
breath.  He was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics to
include vancomycin and Zosyn at that time.  He then
experienced improvement in his oxygen saturation initially,
but was unable to obtain 100%.  He had a CAT scan performed,
which further delineated a left lower lobe density that had
been seen on chest x-ray.  This CAT scan of the chest
demonstrated stenosis of the trachea.  The patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further workup of his tracheal stenosis.

father has passed away.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.8, heart rate
105, blood pressure 135/76, and oxygen saturation 98% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  In general:  The patient is a
well-developed and well-nourished Caucasian male in no acute
distress.  Chest:  Lungs revealed decreased breath sounds
throughout, bilateral wheezes, particularly in the upper
airways.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops, positive S1, S2.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  3+ edema
bilaterally up to quarter way up the legs bilaterally.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 14.4,
hematocrit 33, platelets 137.  Sodium 135, potassium 4.7,
chloride 97, bicarb 27, BUN 34, creatinine 1.3, glucose 235,
AST 106, ALT 109, alkaline phosphatase 460, total bilirubin
11.8, albumin 3.0, digoxin level 1.1, PT 10.6, PTT 25, INR
0.9.

Sputum cultures from outside hospital were consistent with
pseudomonas and MRSA, sensitive to Tobramycin and vancomycin.
Blood cultures were all negative to date.

An abdominal ultrasound from the outside hospital on [**3-1**]
showed no dilation of the extrahepatic biliary tree, no
calculi.

A chest x-ray from [**2160-2-29**] revealed persistent
retrocardiac opacity.

An ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities from [**2160-2-25**]
revealed no DVT.

An EKG from [**2160-2-28**] revealed sinus tachycardia with PAC's
and Q waves in II, III, and aVF.  It also showed a left axis
deviation, right bundle branch block, but no ST-T wave
elevations.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple
medical problems, who presents with tracheomalacia seen on
chest CT.  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup of
his tracheomalacia, bronchoscopy, and stent placement.

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE FROM [**2160-3-5**] TO [**2160-3-23**]:  The
rest will be dictated at a later time.

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for a bronchoscopy to evaluate his
tracheomalacia.  He underwent an initial bronchoscopy on
[**2160-3-7**].  He underwent a repeat bronchoscopy with three
stents placed in the LMS, RBI, and distal trachea that
contains silicone on [**2160-3-11**].  Cultures from this
bronchoscopy were consistent with inflammation and not
malignancy.  He was placed on empiric antibiotics to include
vancomycin, inhaled tobramycin, and intravenous Flagyl for
pseudomonas and MRSA that were isolated from the outside
hospital.

Repeated ABGs were performed, which revealed compensated
chronic respiratory alkalosis consistent with the patient's
history of COPD and bronchiectasis.  The patient was weaned
as tolerated to what became his baseline of 97% on 3 liters
of oxygen.  The Interventional Pulmonology team followed the
patient closely.  Patient was started on a steroid taper, and
at the time of this dictation, his prednisone was 30 mg p.o.
q.d.  He was also maintained on his albuterol and ipratropium
bromide nebulizers with improvement of his symptoms.

2. FEN/GI:  The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound
at the outside hospital, which revealed no calculi and normal
biliary tree.  However, because his liver function tests
continued to trend up and his bilirubin reached a peak of 12,
a repeat ultrasound was obtained, which is again within
normal limits.

The patient underwent a MRCP, which showed a mass in the head
of the pancreas.  The ERCP team was consulted for further
evaluation.  At the time of this dictation, the patient is
planned for a potential ERCP if he is cleared by Anesthesia.
His AMA, [**Doctor First Name **], alpha-fetoprotein, and hepatitis panel were all
within normal limits except for a hepatitis C viral load of
greater than 700,000.  A SPEP and UPEP were within normal
limits with no evidence of [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein.  He did have
elevated calcium 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9
levels consistent with malignancy.

Patient initially presented with asterixis, which improved
when lactulose titrated up to [**1-24**] bowel movements a day.  He
was continued on nadolol for esophageal varices, ursodiol,
and Protonix.  The patient was started on a 2-gram sodium,
low fat, low cholesterol diet.  Nutrition consult was
obtained, and the patient was started on a multivitamin, zinc
supplementation, and vitamin C supplementation.  He did have
one day of peripheral nutrition.  However, since his caloric
count was within normal limits, this was discontinued.

3. Cardiovascular:  The patient had evidence of congestive
heart failure on admission.  He diuresed well and became
euvolemic at the time of this dictation with intravenous
Lasix.  The patient's daily weights were stable.  He was
continued on his digoxin as his level was within normal
limits.  He had an echocardiogram on [**3-21**], which revealed
left atrial and left ventricular wall thicknesses, mild
dilatation of left ventricle, ejection fraction of 25-30%,
and resting wall motion abnormalities of the septal,
inferolateral, and inferior akinesis with anterior
hypokinesis.  There was normal right ventricular chamber
size, severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis,
and moderate to 2+ mitral regurgitation.  There is also
moderate size pericardial effusion.  Patient was continued on
his home dose of metoprolol.

4. Infectious disease:  The patient has completed a 14-day
course of intravenous vancomycin for his
tracheomalacia/bronchiectasis, which was fo
