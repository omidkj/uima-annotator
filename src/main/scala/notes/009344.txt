170/100) with diffuse rhonchi/exp wheeze.  EMS unable to obtain
IV access with cont tachypnea in 36, 86% 10L NC -> 92% on 100%

failure.  Pt received IV lasix 80 mg, propofol started
hypotensed to SBP 80's.  Received 250 cc IVF bolus and started
on dopamine, titrated to 20 mcg/kg/min with SBP in 90's.
Initial CVP 6 subsequently received additional 1 L NS.  Initial
CXR c/w CHF.  Per family report, with exception of chronic LBP
with LLE sciatica, pt has no new issues including complaint of
CP, SOB, abd pain, papitation.  Pt recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Date range (1) 32136**] s/p fall with L ankle fracture and delirium.  At that
time, she underwent cardiac evaluation including TTE, ROMI, and
PMIBI without evidence of perfusion defect, ischemia, or new
wall motion abnormalities.  Howerever, newly noted mod-severe AS
(tricuspid sclerotic) with mean gradient of 35 mm Hg.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F with hx of CAD s/p PCI [**2138**], diastolic dysfunction with
mod-severe AS, PAF, presented with hypoxic respiratory failure.
Most likely flash pulmonary edema with etiology: rapid afib ->
flash vs. medical noncompliance -> CHF-> rapid a-fib. Unlikely
acute ischemia since CE's were negative on admission. However,
the echo during this admission showed worsening EF and recent
changes in wall motion with hypokiesis suggesting recent
ischemic event.  Pt had a recent admission with similar
presentation with CHF w/ rapid a-fib. CHF was managed with IV
lasix with goal CVP of <10.  On [**1-12**], pt went into rapid a-fib
on two occasion (11am, 6pm) with hypotension requiring DC
cardioversion & IV amiodarone bolus plus continuous drip.  Rapid
a-fib most likely in a setting of overdiuresis as the CVP was
low after diuresis with IV lasix. A-fib may be the trigger of
her frequent flash pulmonary edema as she has an outflow
obstruction and requires adequate atrial contraction during
diastole. She remained Dopamine dependent mostly since she had
to be heavily sedated for agitation.  On [**1-13**] pt was briefly
extubated and off Dopamine, but had to be re-intubated after
being severely agitated and desaturation.  While she was
extubated, she was extremely disoriented, agitated, minimally
responsive to Haldol.  She has underlying pain issue from spinal
stenosis which precipitated the dramatic changes in her BP while
she was awake.  Once re-intubated and pt became hypotensive and
Dopamine was re-started.  Then, pt went into another rapid a-fib
with hypotension requiring 200 J x1.  After long family meeting,
family decided to make her DNR but continue the current
management until her son from [**Name2 (NI) **] arrived.  When all of her sons
were at the scene, family decdied to make her CMO.  All of the
medications were removed except for fentanyl and versed drip,
and she was breathing on PS 5/0.  Pt expired on [**2140-1-15**] 5:01
am.
