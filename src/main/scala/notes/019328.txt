History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with prior hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, bilateral carotid
artery stenosis who was diagnosed with bilateral RAS by MRA 1
month prior to rising Cr. An MRA showed bilateral RAS with L>R.
The left-sided plaque is contiguous with an ulcerated plaque in
the aorta. Given the severity of her renal artery stenosis, the
patient was admitted for stenting. She has been feeling
increasing shortness of breath since stopping her diovan and
lasix and more severe SOB over the past 2 days. The patient also
reports no appetite and just eating to "stay alive." She also
has nearly no urine output. She denies any
constipation/diarrhea/abdominal pain, fevers, chills, cough.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 82 yo F with PVD and severe bilateral renal artery
stenosis, severe HTN secondary to RAS, and [**Doctor First Name 48**] who was admitted
for renal artery stenting secondary to recent admission for
poorly controlled hypertension and CHF. During her hospital
stay, she developed hypertensive emergency requiring transfer to
the CCU with SBP 260 and flash pulmonary edema. She was started
on a labetalol drip and diuresed with IV lasix. The renal team
agreed with managment. She underwent right renal artery stent x
1 as a salvage attempt for her renal failure. However, this
salvage attempt failed and she returned in cardiogenic shock and
was made CMO. Her code status was determined with the patient
and her PCP as the patient expressed that she would never want
hemodialysis. All of her lines were removed and she remained
unresponsive with 100% NRB and passed away peacefully on [**11-1**]
while on a morphine drip.
