IMAGING:
[**2-11**] CXR: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
Permanent pacemaker remains in satisfactory position. The lungs
are grossly clear except for a calcified granuloma at the left
apex. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus
laterally, most likely due to pleural thickening and less likely
due to pleural effusion.
.
[**2-10**] CXR: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with mild
cardiomegaly. The aorta is calcified. There is a single-lead
left-sided pacemaker in place with its tip in the right
ventricle, unchanged. The patient is post-median sternotomy and
aortic valve replacement. The lungs appear clear. Small pleural
effusion
seen on the prior study at the left costophrenic angle has since
resolved. There is minimal blunting, possibly due to pleural
thickening. Pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no
pneumothorax. Calcification is seen of the mitral annulus.
Several healed/healing left posterior rib fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: No CHF or pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Hyperglycemia - Mr. [**Known lastname 7435**] was started on an insulin drip to
help bring his elevated blood glucose under control. On hospital
day #2, the insulin drip was discontinued and he was able to be
maintained on a HISS. Once his insulin drip was discontinued, he
was also able to be transferred out of the ICU and to a medicine
floor. With his history of CRI, the team decided that glipizide
would be better than glyburide so he was started on glipizide
5mg PO BID and his glyburide was discontinued.  He received
volume resuscitation while in the ICU, but due to his h/o CHF
and an EF of 25%, his IVF were discontinued once he was taking
adequate POs on the floor. However, his Cr began to rise and his
electrolytes on hospital day #4 were consistent with
hypovolemia, possibly due to persistent hyperglycemia and
glucosuria, so he received 1L NS at 100/hr and had his
electrolytes rechecked. They were unchanged, so he was continued
on IVF overnight until the liter was completed. Electrolytes
were slightly better the following morning, but his Cr remained
elevated as did his glucose. Additional fluids were given and
repeat lytes showed a Na of 129, no change in his Cr (still
1.5), and his glucose remained elevated. His IVF were
discontinued. Repeat UA was checked and showed a glucose of 250
in his urine. He had been receiving approximately 16u of Humalog
daily for elevated fingersticks, so he was started on 20u of
Lantus at night on hospital day #5 to attempt to bring his
glucose under better control. His FS were improved on Lantus,
without any low values, so he was discharged on daily Lantus
with strict instructions to check his FS TID to monitor for low
levels.
.
## UTI - On admission, a urinalysis was done and a UTI was
identified. Mr. [**Known lastname 7435**] was started on a 7 day course of Bactrim
empirically. Urine culture was contaminated (mixed flora) so no
organism was able to be identified originally. Bactrim was
discontinued on [**2101-2-14**] and he was started on cipro instead as we
were concerned that Bactrim was responsible for his elevated Cr.
Repeat UA on [**2101-2-14**] was concerning for acute interstitial
nephritis and possibly persistent UTI. Urine eos were sent and
were positive. Repeat urine cx is pending on discharge.
.
## CHF - He was continued on Toprol XL and digoxin originally
and his diuretics were held as he was in need of volume
repletion. On hospital day #2, he developed rapid atrial
fibrillation and his Toprol XL was changed to metoprolol for [**Hospital1 **]
dosing and better rate control. He was well rate controlled on
this dose. He had no problems with SOB or edema during his
hospitalization. He tolerated his IVF infusions well, without
any evidence of CHF. On discharge, he was switched back to his
Toprol XL.
.
## CAD - He was continued on his statin, ASA and bblocker
(changed from Toprol XL to metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] as stated above during
his hospitalization). Per the patient and his daughter, he is no
longer taking the ASA (both were unclear why) so the patient
refused the ASA during his hospital stay. His cardiac enzymes
were cycled on admission and revealed a slight elevation in his
troponins (peak 0.09), CK-MB (peak 11), and CK (peak of 302).
They all trended down by hospital day #3. He denied any chest
pain, pressure or palpitations. It was felt to most likely be
some demand ischemia because of his rapid rate. EKGs were
unchanged fro
