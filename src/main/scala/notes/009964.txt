Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13129**]
Chief Complaint:
tachypnea, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR guided thoracentesis [**2124-5-30**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 665**] is an 89 yo F with a history of atrial fibrillation,
CKD, HTN, hypothyroidism who presents from her nursing home with
hypoxia and tachypnea. The patient mentions that she was in her
usual state of health, when last night at her nursing home she
was "unable to get comfortable". This morning she felt short of
breath. Denies any chest pain, but has had occasional
palpitations. Denies fevers, chills, cough, or sputum
production.
.
Her lasix 20mg daily was changed on [**2124-5-19**] to lasix 40mg po
daily. She was also started on Azithromycin 500mg on [**2124-5-19**]. On
the morning of admission, she was found to have a weight of
144lbs (baseline 139lbs). This morning at Rehab she was found to
be 86% on RA, and was placed on a NRB. HR 123, T 96.3. EMS was
called.
.
Notably, the patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 32718**] with
dyspnea on exertion and acute renal failure. She was diuresed,
and discharged on lasix 20mg po daily. She was not discharged on
a beta blocker as she had hypotension and 2 episodes of
vasovagal syncope during her admission. She was previously on
atenolol, which may have accumulated during her episode of acute
renal failure. Her Valsartan, Atenolol, and HCTZ were all
stopped on discharge. She was DNR/DNI during that admission.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.2 HR 122 BP 170/101 RR 20 75% on
RA --> 96% on NRB. CXR was concerning for vascular congestion
and bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was given 20mg IV lasix
x1, 10mg IV diltiazem. She was briefly started on a Nitro gtt,
but became hypotensive, so this was stopped. She was started on
BIPAP 10/4 FiO2 100% with improvement in tachypnea. The
EDstarted her on a diltiazem gtt for improved rate control, and
to empirically start Vancomycin 1g, Ceftriaxone 1g, and
Azithromycin 500mg IV x1 for pneumonia. Vitals prior to transfer
were BP 120s/60s HR 100-110 RR 18.
.
On the floor, the patient is breathing comfortably on 80% high
flow. She denies any chest pain, fevers, or cough.
.

MICRO:
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2124-5-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2124-5-28**]):    NO GROWTH.

ECG [**2124-5-22**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and probable
ventricular premature beat. Low limb lead QRS voltage. Delayed R
wave progression. Modest right precordial lead T wave changes
are suggested but unstable baseline in those leads makes
assessment difficult. Findings are non-specific. Since the
previous tracing of [**2124-5-2**] ventricular rate is faster.

Portable CXR [**2124-5-22**]:
FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
Layering
bilateral pleural effusions are present with pulmonary vascular
congestion and probable mild pulmonary edema. Heart size is
difficult to assess.
Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob noted. Bones
appear
grossly intact with degenerative changes in the upper lumbar
spine and mild scoliosis. There are consolidations/atelectasis
at both lung bases, likely atelectasis, though cannot exclude
underlying pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with congestive heart failure
with bilateral pleural effusions.

Portable CXR [**2124-5-30**]:
FINDINGS:
There is a moderate to large right pleural effusion. There is
associated volume loss on the right. Left small to moderate
effusion and basal atelectasis is also seen. Superimposed
consolidation is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.

Comparison to prior exam somewhat limited by different
projection with different dependent positioning of the bilateral
effusions compared to prior exam. There is likely to be minimal
change allowing for this.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo F with a history of atrial fibrillation, CKD, HTN,
hypothyroidism who presents from her nursing home with hypoxia
and tachypnea.

# CHF EXACERBATION:  She presented in acute hypoxic respiratory
distress from her nursing home with both desaturations on room
air and increased work of breathing.  Congestion and effusion
seen on CXR suggested diastolic heart failure decompensation as
a likely etiology.  Given her elevated filling pressures, she
likely cannot tolerate increased heart rates, and her RVR likely
precipitated the pulmonary congestion.  Her trops were mildly
elevated with flat MB fractions, suggesting a rate-induced
demand.  She was diuresed aggressively with furosemide 20mg IV
wityh good effect and transitioned to home
