Date of Birth:  [**2103-7-1**]        Sex:  F

Service:  TRA


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Motor vehicle accident.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Right acetabular fracture; status post closed reduction of
   right hip and status post open reduction/internal fixation
   of right acetabulum.
2. Pseudomonas pneumonia.
3. Yeast urinary tract infection.
4. Presumed Clostridium difficile colitis.
5. Hypertension.
6. Type 2 diabetic - now insulin requiring.
7. Left thumb ligament tear; status post splinting.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
woman who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after a motor
vehicle accident.  She was a restrained driver.  There was
airbag deployment and question of loss of consciousness.  The
patient initially complained of right hip pain and left wrist
pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Type 2 diabetes.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Cesarean section.
2. Cholecystectomy.
3. Bladder repair.
4. Total abdominal hysterectomy.
5. Breast biopsy.


MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.
2. Lipitor 10 mg daily.
3. Metformin 1000 mg b.i.d.
4. Atenolol 50 mg daily.
5. Glyburide 6 mg b.i.d.
6. Lisinopril 50 mg daily.
7. Avandia 8 mg daily.


RADIOLOGY:  As part of her trauma workup, the patient had a
head CT which was negative for a bleed or mass effect.

A CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a posterior right
acetabular wall fracture with a posterior dislocation of the
right femur.  There was a small 4.5-cm hematoma superior and
medial projecting into the pelvis.  Fragments of the
acetabular fracture were in the joint space.  There was also
a question of a pulmonary contusion in the lung windows of
the CT scan.

Cervical spine and thoracolumbosacral were negative.

Left wrist films demonstrated no fracture but change
consistent with a left thumb ligamentous injury.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was otherwise
hemodynamically stable without evidence of significant
intrathoracic or intraabdominal soft tissue injury.  The
patient was taken emergently to the Operating Room for a
closed reduction of her right hip.  This was done immediately
upon her admission.

The following morning, the patient was taken back to the
Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] for open reduction and
internal fixation of her right acetabulum.  This occurred
without event.

The patient's following hospital course was notable for
difficulty weaning from the mechanical ventilation.  The
patient was slowly weaned and diuresed appropriately.  Prior
to extubation, the patient developed a fever and an elevated
white count which prompted a fever workup.  The fever workup
revealed sputum positive for Pseudomonas in her sputum.  This
was treated with Zosyn and gentamicin for double coverage.
The patient subsequently weaned off of the ventilator and was
diuresed appropriately.

The remainder of her hospital course was fairly unremarkable.
She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit and on to
the floor.  On the floor, the patient worked with Physical
Therapy - although she was touchdown weightbearing to her
right lower extremity only.  The patient was also followed
closely by [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes in consultation for management of
her blood sugars.  They readjusted her hypoglycemic and
insulin regimen.

The patient did have some low-grade temperatures in the week
prior to discharge; although she had been afebrile for 72
hours prior to the date of discharge.  Her white count
fluctuated between the 12 and 16 range during this time.  She
complained symptomatically of some loose stools.  She was
placed on metronidazole empirically on the day prior to
discharge for a possible Clostridium difficile colitis.  The
patient was also placed on fluconazole for a 7-day course on
the day prior to discharge for a yeast urinary tract
infection which was documented.

On the day of discharge, the patient was tolerating a regular
diet with adequate pain control on by mouth medications and
stable for discharge.
