CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82 year old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2150**], inferior
myocardial infarction in [**2159**], status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty at [**Hospital 36653**] Clinic in [**2158**],
who is transferred from an outside hospital for chest pain,
left arm numbness and nausea.  The patient noted the night
before admission and the day of admission chest pain across
his chest associated with left arm numbness and nausea.  He
denied shortness of breath or diaphoresis.  His pain was
noted by daughter who had taken him home from the nursing
home for lunch and took him immediately back to the nursing
home when he told her that he had chest pain.  The patient is
unsure of how long the chest pain lasted the day before
admission but lasted one to two hours on the day of
admission.  The patient is an extremely poor historian
secondary to his parkinsonian's dementia.

Electrocardiogram on presentation showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations
in 3, AVF and downsloping ST depression in precordial leads
V4 through V6.  His initial CPK was 30 and troponin was
negative.  He was started on nitroglycerin GTT, heparin GTT,
Integrilin and Lopressor and was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for possible catheterization
at an outside hospital.

On presentation to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 1760**] he was chest pain free and
was maintained on the same GTT.  In the AM while still in the
Emergency Department the patient had more chest pains and
associated shortness of breath and was given intravenous
Lasix.  He was given steroids, Zantac and Benadryl for
shellfish allergy and was taken to the Catheterization
Laboratory.  Complicated catheterization required 300 cc of
dye in order to visualize the graft.  PCW 30, PA saturation
76%, V wave 35, right atrial pressure 12, right ventricular
pressure 64/8, left ventricular end diastolic pressure 35.
The patient had no significant left main disease but left
anterior descending was occluded at the origin and severe
proximal stenosis at the origin of obtuse marginal 1 was
noted.  Also mid left circumflex occlusion and proximal
occlusion of right coronary artery.  In terms of the
patient's graft, the saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
was patent with complex severe distal stenosis, the saphenous
vein graft to left anterior descending was patent was 90%
distal stenosis with thrombus and the saphenous vein graft to
right coronary artery has 90% proximal stenosis with
thrombus.  Transthoracic echocardiography was performed
demonstrating an ejection fraction of 20 to 30% with global
reduction of left ventricular systolic function. The inferior
wall was noted to be akinetic and trace aortic regurgitation
was mild 11+ mitral regurgitation was noted.  The patient was
transferred out of the catheterization laboratory to the
Coronary Care Unit for observation and consideration of
further options.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in nursing home.  By patient report,
quit tobacco 50 years ago.  No current alcohol or tobacco
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission from
the Emergency Room, temperature 90.6, pulse 79, blood
pressure 157/86, respiratory rate 16, 95% on 2 liters.  In
general this is a thin elderly male in no acute distress.
Oropharynx is benign.  Pupils are equally round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Pupils 2 mm.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm with S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops
noted.  Jugulovenous pressure at 4 cm.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended with good bowel sounds.  Extremities with 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Notable laboratory data on admission are
BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, white blood cells 6.1 with 61
neutrophils, 23 lymphocytes, hematocrit 43, platelets 214.
At an outside hospital CK is 30 and troponin is negative.
Bilirubin is slightly elevated at 1.1, but ALT 25, AST 13,
alkaline phosphatase 110, PT 11.4 with INR of 0.8.

Electrocardiogram demonstrates at outside hospital normal
sinus rhythm, axis and intervals within normal limits.  Q in
2, 3 and AVF, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in 3 and AVF, [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depressions in V2, V3 and downsloping ST depressions in V4
through V6 which at [**Hospital6 256**] was
similar.  Chest x-ray demonstrated unusual tracheal course
secondary to a possible thyroid mass and some emphysematous
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - A.  Ischemia, the
patient proceeded to rule in for myocardial infarction with
CKs of 192, 1122, 1362, 1131, and then proceeded to taper
down to 739, 127 on [**1-31**].  The patient underwent
catheterization with results as above and was transferred to
Coronary Care Unit without intervention.  Discussion ensued
with family and patient who decided that high risk PCI was
not desirable at this time and the patient should be
medically managed.  The patient was continued on Beta
blocker, ACE inhibitor and Aspirin therapy as well as Plavix
q. day.  Lipitor and Imdur were continued and the patient
underwent 48 hour course of Integrilin.  Lopressor and ACE
inhibitor were titrated up as an inpatient and will continue
to be titrated up as an outpatient as the patient tolerates.

B.  Pump, the patient was noted to have an ejection fraction
of 20% on transthoracic echocardiography and will continue
medical management.  Lasix was begun and the patient will
continue Captopril and Digoxin.

C.  Rhythm, the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with
occasional runs of premature ventricular contractions but no
more than 3 at a time were noted.  Telemetry was continued
during this hospitalization.

2.  Neurological - The patient with a history of Parkinson's
with associated symptoms of dementia.  Aricept and Ropinirole
were continued throughout this hospitalization with no
issues.

3.  Code Status - The patient is Do-Not-Resuscitate,
Do-Not-Intubate.  This status was temporarily suspended
during the patient's catheterization but was reinstated in
the post procedure period.

4.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition -  The patient was
maintained on cardiac diet during this admission with no
further issues.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation once his medical management is optimized and a
rehabilitation bed is available.

1.  Severe coronary artery disease
2.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm
