History of Present Illness:
62 year old man who underwent an endoscopic CABG [**2182-10-21**]. He
had done well but underwent a stress test in preparation for
vacation which was negative for chest pain but revealed ?EKG
changes. Therefore underwent an angiogram revealed patent
anastomosis with excellent filling of both proximal and distal
LAD and diagnol, however, the LIMA graft was seemed to take an
acute curve in the distal third with what looked like narrowing.
 The decision was then made to take the patient to the operating
room to undergo redo surgery to straighten graft.

Pertinent Results:
Intraop TEE [**2182-11-14**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with ,mild to moderate hypokinesis of the
anterior, anterolateral, anteroseptal and septal walls. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 83588**] admitted as a same day admission for a planned
minimally invasive revision of left internal mammary artery
graft.  However, the minimally invasive procedure was unable to
be performed and he was converted to a redo CABG x1 with LIMA to
the LAD via sternotomy.  Total bypass time was 72 minutes, cross
clamp time 50 minutes.  See operative note for full details.

The patient was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
NeoSynephrine and propofol.  NeoSynephrine was quickly weaned
off and he was started on nitroglycerin for blood pressure
control.  He was started on Amiodarone for ventricular ectopy on
his postoperative night.  However, this was discontinued
secondary to bradycardia on post operative day 1.  He was
eventually started on low dose beta blockers, which he tolerated
well.  He was extubated without incidence on postoperative
night.  He was weaned from the nitroglycerin on postoperative
day 1 and transferred to the step down unit in stable condition.

Once on the floor, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 83589**] continued to progress well.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol.  He was given Ultram and Motrin for pain control.  His
hematocrit was trending down to a nadir of 23.7 but he was
hemodynamically stable.  His repeat hematocrit at the time of
discharge was 26.9.  He was tolerating a full po diet,
ambulating in the [**Doctor Last Name **] with physical therapy and his incisions
were healing well.  It was felt that he was safe for discharge
home with VNA services on postoperative day # 5.
