recurrent fevers to 104, chills, and headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a healthy 26 year old woman who presented with a 3 week
history of fever, headache, and dysuria. She was in her USOH
until about 3 weeks ago when she developed dysuria, followed
over three days by fever to 105 degrees and headache. She went
to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] hospital and got blood cultures, UA which
was positive, and LP which was negative. She was discharged on
Augmentin for 10 days, and over the next few days felt much
better. A few days after stopping the augmentin, she has
developed recurrent fevers to 104, chills, and headache and came
to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-6-6**].
.
In the ED she was initially febrile to 103.1, tachycardic to
122, and hypotensive to 94/56. She initially received
approximately 5 liters of IVF for a bp of 76/50 and responded up
to the 100s-110s. Her UOP was excellent (approx 400 cc/hr),
lactate initially 1.4 and mental status appropriate. She was
given levofloxacin 500 mg po and admitted to medicine. Her bp
then dropped again to the 80s/50s and she was febrile to 103.8.
She was given 3 additional liters of fluid, given ceftriaxone,
and admitted to the MICU.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-6-6**] 11:51 PM
HISTORY: Fever, pyelonephritis and hypotension.

IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Heart size top normal. Lungs clear. No pleural effusion.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Pulmonary arteries enhance normally
without filling defect. Densely calcified right lung granuloma.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with trace medial
bibasilar consolidation, most consistent with atelectasis. There
is septal fluid at the bases, suggesting a component of volume
overload/congestive heart failure. Prominent thymic tissue in
this young patient. No abnormal lymph nodes are seen throughout
the chest. The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
otherwise unremarkable. Minimally prominent thymus, likely
within normal limits allowing for patient's age. Axial images
through the upper abdomen demonstrate no abnormalities. Bone
windows demonstrate no abnormalities.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
confirm the above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Small bilateral pleural effusions with probable mild volume
overload/congestive heart failure.
3) Medial bibasilar consolidation, most consistent with
atelectasis. However, correlate with clinical picture if there
is suspicion for pneumonia or aspiration.

CTU (ABD/PEL) W/&W/O CONTRAST  [**2145-6-7**] 2:16 AM

CTU (ABD/PEL) W/&W/O CONTRAST; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST

Reason: r/o stone, r/o abscess, r/o hydro
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
26 year old woman with likley recurrent pyelo and abdominal
pain. Would like to rule out both stone and abscess - please do
with and without contrast.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o stone, r/o abscess, r/o hydro
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 26-year-old woman with likely recurrent pyelo and
abdominal pain, would like to rule out stone and abscess.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging
of the abdomen and pelvis was reviewed.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear, and the
visualized heart is normal. The liver enhances homogeneously
without focal lesions. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, small
bowel loops, and adrenals are normal. Multiple wedge-shaped
perfusion abnormalities are present within the left kidney that
are consistent with pyelonephritis. The right kidney
demonstrates a normal perfusion pattern. There is no evidence
for nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis. There is no
hydronephrosis. No perinephric fluid collections are identified.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The distal ureters and bladder are
normal without evidence for obstruction. The uterus is normal,
no adnexal masses are identified. The rectum, and large bowel
are normal caliber. No pathologic adenopathy is present in the
abdomen and pelvis. There is no free fluid or free air in the
abdomen or pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: Bone island is present within the left ischium,
otherwise the osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Left pyelonephritis. No evidence for hydronephrosis,
stone, or perinephric abscess.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2145-6-8**] 1:42 PM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: FEVER

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
26 year old woman with fever and tachycardia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVT
DOPPLER ULTRASOUND STUDY OF BOTH LOWER LIMB VEINS

CLINICAL DETAILS: Evaluate for deep venous thrombosis.

FINDINGS: The right and left lower limb veins are patent and
compressible along their length. Phasic venous flow and
increased venous return with augmentation is demonstrated with
Doppler.

Incidental note is made of a small (8 mm x 7 mm x 1.9 cm
sagittal) cyst, directly adjacent to the lateral aspect of the
left knee joint, in the left fibular head. [**Month (only) 116**] represent a small
meniscal cyst for example.

CONCLUSION:

No right or left lower limb deep venous thrombosis.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2145-6-10**] 10:31 AM

INDICATION: 26-year-old woman with pyelonephritis, continuing to
spike fevers, also assess for pneumonia.

COMPARISONS: CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2145-6-7**] and CTA chest of
[**2145-6-7**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images through the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis with oral and 150 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast. No
reformats were perform
