Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Left MCA stroke; transferred from outside hospital following
TPA.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16008**] is a 59yo F with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, DM2, Left CEA,
and history of R MCA infarct who had acute onset of global
aphasia and right sided weakness at 9:15am on [**8-18**]. She was
doing well at home fixing eggs in her kitchen when she suddenly
dropped her spatula and was unable to speak. She understood
simple commands, and went to lay down in bed. Shortly thereafter
when EMS arrived she was unable to get out of bed. Taken to
[**Hospital 8641**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] and given IV TPA at 11:50am for
NIHSS of 22 (-2 questions, -2 aphasia, -6 motor left arm and
leg, -8 motor right arm and leg, -2 sensory on the right side,
-2 dysarthria). Arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **], monitored in the
Neuro ICU overnight and she is called out to the neurology
floor.

Prior to presentation the patient had a left MCA infarct in [**Month (only) 116**]
[**2181**] with similar presenting symptoms. She receieved speech and
physical therapy at home following the event. At baseline until
Sunday she has been ambulating without assistance with "normal"
speech- perhaps occasional word finding difficulty. She was not
on aspirin prior to her stroke in [**Month (only) 116**] due to history of GI
bleeding. She was started on aspirin in [**Month (only) 116**].

Upon evaluation on the neurology floor her strenth on the right
side had returned to [**Location 74587**]. She is able to answer "yes," and
understands simple commands, and becomes visibly frustrated by
her inability to communicate.

The patient was unable to offer a complete ROS, but denies pain
or discomfort.

Social History:

use. no current ETOH.


Family History:
unavailable

Physical Exam:
VS:  T  98.9    BP 140/47     RR 17    Sat  96% on 4L

PE:
HEENT 	AT/NC, MMM no lesions
Neck 	Supple, no bruits
Chest 	difficult to clearly auscultate breath sounds due to
obesity.
CVS 	RRR, no m/r/g (but again, obesity limits quality of this)
ABD 	obese; protruding umbilicus with palpable hernia which is
full but not painful.  there is no evidence of skin
discoloration.
EXT 	no C/C/E, some ecchymosis noted over the right flank.

NEUROLOGICAL
MS: 	
General: 	alert, appropriately interactive, normal affect;
patient gets visibly frustrated when asked questions by the
examiner, and she is unable to get the words out.
Orientation: 	unable to assess because the patient is aphasic
Attention:	tracks to the examiner during the exam, but unable to
fully assess because the patient is aphasic
Speech/[**Doctor Last Name **]: 	expressive aphasia; she is limited to saying "yep"
and "no".  she did make one attempt to say
"hydrochlorothiazide".
She follows 1 step command, but when she is faced with 2 steps,
she appears to be confused by the request.  she was unable to
understand the command "stick out your tongue" or "lift your
left
hand"

CN:
II,III: 	pupils 4-->2 mm bilaterally to light, optics discs
sharp
and flat
III,IV,V:	EOMI, no ptosis.
VII: 	there is a mild right sided facial droop with evidence of
flattening of the nasolabial fold on the right.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 	SCM/trapezeii could not be assessed well by the examiner
because she had difficulty understanding the task of shrugging
her shoulder.
XII: 	patient unable to understand the command of protruding her
tongue.

Motor:	Normal bulk and tone; no tremor, rigidity, or
bradykinesia.  Unable to sustain elevation of her right arm

Gait:    assessment deferred due to right hemiplegia and fall
risk due to TPA

DISCHARGE EXAMINATION


Pertinent Results:
TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial  appendage. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,  color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Overall left ventricular  systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta to 45cm. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-8-19**] 1:53 AM
FINDINGS: Diffusion and ADC map images show a large area of
acute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory,
mostly in the left temporal lobe, insula, and posterior left
frontal lobe. Two other separate foci of diffusion abnormality
are seen, one in the left parietal region, the other in the
right medial frontal lobe, adjacent to the cingulate gyrus.
These are confirmed by the ADC map to be acute; their
multiplicity and bilaterality also suggest an embolic
phenomenon.

MR angiography images demonstrate marked attenuation and lack of
flow in the distal left M1 segment, with lack of flow in several
portions of the M2, M3, and M4 segments. The right middle
cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, and vertebrobasilar
system appear patent, without aneurysm, significant stenosis, or
vascular malformation.

IMPRESSION: Acute infarction in both hemispheres, mostly in the
left MCA territory. Bilaterality and multiplicity suggests an
embolic phenomenon. Please note that this study is incomplete,
as the remainder of standard brain MRI images were not obtained
due to patient inability to tolerate the examination.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-8-19**] 1:31 PM
IMPRESSION: Developing hypodensity in the left MCA territory as
well as a left parietal wedge-shaped density are seen, without
findings to suggest hemorrhagic transformation. Incidentally
noted are several punctate calcifications distributed throughout
the hemispheres in a pattern suggesting pial artery
calcifications. Otherwise, there is no significant interval
change

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 16008**] is a 59 year old woman with DM2, HTN,
Hyperlipidemia, L CEA, prior MCA infarct who presented with new
onset global aphasia and right sided weakness. She was
administered TPA at an outside hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care. On arrival she had resolving right sided
weakness and persistent global aphasia. Etiology of her prior
infarctions is unclear aside from multiple vascular risk factors
of likely an embolic source based on multifocal appearance of
neuroimaging.

1) MCA infarct
Her presenting symptoms likely represent a total MCA occlusion,
that appears to have recanulized partially preserving motor
function. She was started on Aspirin therapy following her first
stroke in [**2182-4-23**] despite history of GI bleeding requiring
transfusions. This second stroke (two prior infarcts were
radiographic findings only) represents a failure of aspirin
therapy. During this admission she was started on aggrenox [**Hospital1 **]
in combination with aspirin 8
