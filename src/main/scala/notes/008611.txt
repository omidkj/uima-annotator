Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin,Porcine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
81-year-old male with history of CAD, systolic CHF (EF [**8-16**] of
35%)COPD, CRF (recent baseline 2.0), recent HIT [**8-16**] (off
anticoagulation), now p/w shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and
LE edema from [**Hospital3 2558**]. Per patient report, he had been
doing well - in fact had walked 18 stairs with PT just a little
over 24 hrs ago. Then last night woke up several times feeling
diaphoretic, SOB with ambulation. No chest pain (denies jaw or
arm pain), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. Some burning on
urination. He denies cough - though notes from the [**Hospital 7137**] report this for 3 days. He also reports recent increased
LE edema.

Of note, he was recently discharged ([**9-9**]). At that time he had
chest pain and what was felt to be some demand ischemia - likely
due to tachycardia from anemia and relative volume depletion. He
was thought to have a GIB, received one unit of pRBCs, and
anticoagulation for HIT was discontinued (though no endscopy at
that time). Hyponatremia and acute on chronic renal failure
improved with IVFs. Prior to this, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was discharged on
[**8-22**] during which time he was treated for decompensated heart
failure.

Imaging:
.
[**9-22**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion with
overlying atelectasis. Evidence of fluid overload.
Constellations of findings may be due to CHF.
.
[**9-23**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of the pulmonary
vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. Increase of
bilateral diffuse opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.
.
[**9-24**] CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**9-23**], there has
been some interval improvement of the diffuse bilateral
pulmonary opacifications, consistent with some improvement in
pulmonary vascular status. The possibility of multifocal
pneumonia must be seriously considered. Atelectatic changes and
layering pleural effusions are seen bilaterally.
.
EKGs:
.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2110-9-24**]  10:52:46 AM
Probable sinus tachycardia with borderline A-V conduction delay.
Left
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-9-22**]
the
ventricular premature beat is absent. Ventricular rate is
slower.
.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2110-9-24**]  5:10:22 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block with secondary
repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-9-24**]
multiple
abnormalities persist without major change
.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2110-9-22**]  5:41:10 PM
Regular tachycardia of uncertan mechanism but it is probably
sinus tachycardia with A-V conduction delay and ventricular
premature beat. Left bundle-branch block. Since the previous
tracing of [**2110-9-6**] tachycardic rate is faster.




Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course: 81yoM with h/o CAD, chronic systolic
heart failure (EF 35%) with recent exacerbation 1 month ago, CKD
baseline Cr 2.5, h/o HIT, COPD, who presents with worsening
dyspnea.
.
# Dyspnea: On presentation, the patient described PND, and a CXR
was consistent with flash pulmonary edema. His BNP elevated at
40K. He had no fever, cough, or leukocytosis to support a
diagnosis of PNA. He had LENIs two weeks ago which were
negative, making PE less likely. Our differential diagnosis for
his pulmonary edema included CHF exacerbation (he was not taking
lasix prior to admission vs possibly increased sodium intake) vs
ischemia/angina vs bilateral renal artery stenosis. There was no
wheezing on initial exam. His EKG was without ischemic changes,
trops mildly elevated (but within his recent baseline). He was
treated with BIPAP briefly in the ED, but was already on nasal
cannula by the time he arrived in the ICU and was treated with
IV lasix and symptomatically improved overnight. He was
transferred to the general floor less than 24 hours later. His
total diuresis was an average of 1L/day. We switched him from IV
lasix to 60mg po lasix on [**9-24**] and then to 40mg po lasix on
[**9-26**], which he tolerated well and can continue upon discharge.
His Chest X-ray showed increasing pulmonary edema on [**9-23**],
followed by resolving edema on [**9-24**]. Transient episodes of
dyspnea were also alleviated by his COPD nebulizers. No fevers
or cough to suggest infection.
-Given his recent admission less than 1 month ago for CHF
exacerbation, if he ret
