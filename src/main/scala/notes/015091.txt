HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2146-3-16**].
After admission the patient underwent cystoscopy to evaluate
his hematuria. Bladder biopsies and retrograde pyelogram were
performed.  The patient had an MRI, which more clearly showed a
lower pole renal mass.  The patient was taken to the
operating room on hospital day three for a left
nephroureterectomy.

On postoperative day one the patient was placed in the ICU
and the patient was extubated on postoperative day one.  The
patient had a chest tube and Foley catheter. After extubation
the patient was transferred onto the floor without any
incidents.  However the patient's course was somewhat
complicated.

On postoperative day two when during the day the patient
developed agitation and desaturation down to 77% after
pulling his chest tube. At that time EKG was obtained and
serial cardiac enzymes were cycled.  It appeared his cardiac
enzymes had elevated.  The patient appeared to have suffered
a non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction.  Cardiology was
consulted.  They recommended cardiac echo which done which is
showing the patient to have a ejection fraction of 30% and
some global hypokinesis.  Under Cardiology recommendations
Captopril was started and Norvasc and Lopressor were started
for patient's blood pressure control and heart rate control.

On postoperative day four due to patient's labile blood
pressure the patient was transferred into the ICU for another
additional day and on the following day the patient's
condition was stabilized and transferred back on to the
floor. Since then the patient has been stable.  Epidural was
discontinued.  The patient regained his previous mental
status.

On postoperative day four his cardiac enzymes level has begun
to trend down. Daily serial EKGs showed no change. The
patient began to pass gas and having bowel movements. The
patient was placed on a regular diet. A repeat chest x-ray
showed the left apical pneumothorax as getting smaller.
Chest tube was discontinued on postoperative day six.  A
chest x-ray following the chest tube discontinued showed
pneumothorax had resolved.  The patient was placed on a
regular diet. Foley catheter was discontinued on
postoperative day six however due to failure to void the
patient's Foley catheter was placed back on postoperative day
seven. At this point the patient is deemed ready for
discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

Prior to discharge the patient was afebrile. Vital signs are
stable. Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  The incision was clean, dry and
intact. Staples were in place.  The patient was tolerating a
regular diet and has been passing gas. The patient will be
discharged with a Foley catheter due to his difficulty to
void. The patient will be instructed to have Foley catheter
voiding trial again in a few days at the rehabilitation
facility.
