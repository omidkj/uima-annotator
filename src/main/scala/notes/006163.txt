Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for complete heart block

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary pacer wire placement under fluoroscopy ([**2103-2-24**])
.
Permanent pacemaker placement ([**2103-2-27**])


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 85 y/o F patient with PMHx of DM, CAD, HTN,
hypothyroidism who presents from OSH with acute pulmonary edema
in the setting of complete heart block.  Patient was transferred
from NH to OSH 1 day PTA for symptoms of weakness and was found
to be bradycardic 20s-40s.  EKG showed initially first degree
heart block with occasional complete heart block (by report).
Also at OSH patient was in acute renal failure and was given
fluids overnight.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
consideration of temp pacemaker.
.
When patient arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] her rhythm strip and 12 lead
confirmed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm in
the 30-40s.  Patient was short of breath on arrival with O2Sat
in the 80s.  She was given 40 IV lasix, started on nitro gtt and
put on non-invasive ventilation.  Decision made to place temp.
pacer wire.

ECG ([**2103-2-24**]): complete heart block with junctional escape
rhythm @ 30; nl axis
.
TTE ([**2103-2-27**]):
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a moderate (42mmHg peak) resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
mitral annular calcification leading to mild functional mitral
stenosis (area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is a very small inferolateral pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the CCU and found on
admission to be severely hypertensive (SBP>200), hypoxic (O2Sat
in mid-80%s on non-rebreather mask), and in complete heart block
with a junctional rhythm.  Her BP was controlled with a
nitroglycerin drip and she was given IV Lasix with good brisk
diuresis.  She was also put on BiPAP while diuresing and was
quickly weaned to 6L nasal cannula.  Due to her instability, EP
place temporary pacer wires under fluoroscopy shortly after
admission.  With the pacer wires in place, she remained stable
over the course of the weekend and had a permanent pacemaker
placed on [**2103-2-27**] and will follow up in device clinic one week
later.
.
Also of note, she was found to be in acute-on-chronic renal
failure upon admission, thought to be secondary to decreased
renal perfusion in the setting of her complete heart block.  Her
ACEi was intially held for this reason.  Once she was paced, her
creatinine improved back to its baseline (1.3-1.5) and her ACEi
was resumed and titrated up.
.
For the pacer placement, she was started intially on IV Ancef
which was then switched to vancomycin post-procedure.  This was
switched to Keflex and she completed a course of antibiotics
through [**2103-3-4**].  On chest x-ray, she was also noted to have a
possibility of a community acquired pneumonia and was started
empirically on PO levofloxacin on [**2103-2-27**]; she will complete a
10-day course of this (three more days).
.
She was evaluated by physical therapy who found her to be
deconditioned and unsteady/unsafe on her feet; however she was
not a candidate for acute rehab and will be discharged to
skilled nursing facility with physical therapy.
.
She was found on physical examination to have a cardiac murmur
which had not been documented on prior exams in our system.  She
had a TTE which showed mild MR and AS as well as outflow
obstruction from LV hypertrophy.  She will follow up in device
clinic one week after pacer placement and will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for further cardiology follow up next month.
.
Her blood pressure was noted to be high, she was controlled on
the following medications: amlodipine, Toprol XL, Hydralazine,
Lisinopril, Isosorbide Mononitrate, and Hydrochlorothiazide.

Discharge Condition:
stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a disturbance in the

block".  For this, you had a pacemaker implanted and you will
complete a 5 day course of prophylactic antibiotics (Keflex).
