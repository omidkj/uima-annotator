History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old male with PMH of multiple myeloma s/p 11
months of chemotherapy through [**7-/2177**], RCC s/p left nephrectomy,
CKI newly started on HD M/W/F as of 2 weeks ago, DM2 c/b
gastroparesis/peripheral neuropathy, HTN, and CAD being
transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] with altered mental
status, Afib with RVR, hypotension requiring neosynephrine drip,
and for IR embolization for what was thought to be a large fluid
collection in his abdomen representing an actively extravasating
hemorrhagic right renal cyst. His current medical issues all
seemed to start with several falls starting about a month ago
when one of his outpatient doctors started [**Name5 (PTitle) **] on a new diuretic
regimen which made him lose 40lbs in 2 weeks and threw off all
of his electroyltes. After one of these falls, he was most
hospitalized at [**Hospital6 5016**] from [**10-11**] to [**10-21**] for a
syncope work-up. He also was found to have epigastric pain with
coffee-ground vomiting at that time. Per OSH records, a CT
abdomen revealed a hemorrhagic cyst of the liver vs. a right
renal hemorrhagic cyst but no management of this fluid
collection was initiated at the time. The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] following transfusion of 3 units
of pRBCs, dialysis, and treatment with Epogen. This morning, he
began complaining of intensifying abdominal pain and the rehab
staff noted pallor on physical exam. He also developed altered
mental status and EMS was called. He was found to be hypotensive
to the 50s, diaphoretic, and pale; but was mentating according
to report. He was transported back to [**Hospital3 **] where his
hematocrit was found to be 24 and a CT abdomen/pelvis was
performed that showed marked interval enlargement of what was
read as an exophytic right renal cyst with concern for active
hemorrhage. He was also noted to be in Afib with RVR to the
120s-130s and a diltiazem drip was started. A neosynephrine drip
was also started for hypotension and he was given 3L of NS. He
was then sent in an ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**] on a neo drip and dropped
his SBP to the 80s transiently which responded to 110s systolic
after a 1L NS bolus.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T=97.4, HR=120, BP=116/64, RR=16,
POx=100% on NRB. He was noted to be in Afib with RVR in the 120s
despite a diltiazem drip started at OSH when he arrived with a
SBP in the 110s on a low dose of neosynephrine drip. On physical
exam he was noted to have a large, tender mass on the right side
of his abdomen. General surgery, urology, and IR were all
consulted. His OSH scans were reviewed and on preliminary read
it looked as though he had a chronic free standing fluid
collection with subacute blood in it, but no active
extravasation. It was unclear if the fluid collection was
originating from the pancreas or the gastroduodenal artery.
There was also a separate right renal/adrenal cyst noted. IR
decided to take the patient for an aortogram to see if there was
any active bleeding that could be embolized. He was also noted
on CXR to have a RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA and was given
a dose of vancomycin and ceftriaxone in the ED. The diltiazem
drip was also stopped and his HR remained in the 120s. The ED
also tried to shut off the neosynephrine drip, but his SBPs fell
to the 90s and it was turned back on prior to going to IR for
his procedure. He also got 2 units of pRBCs for a hematocrit of
26.6 with an unknown baseline. A left IJ triple lumen was also
placed for access in the ED and blood cultures were sent.
.
In the IR suite, the fluid collection was felt to be a
pancreatic pseudocyst. Arteriograms of the aorta, celiac, and
SMA systems revealed no active extravasation or bleeding. The
fluid from this collection was not sampled.
.
In the ICU, initial VS were Temp: 97.2, BP: 122/57, HR: 69 RR:
21, and O2sat: 98% on NC. The patient's main complaint was back
pain which he has chronically and was exacerbated from laying
still after his IR procedure. Besides the pain the patient was
feeling much better and was no longer confused. He mentions that
he was being treated for a PNA found on CXR at his rehab since
[**10-22**]. Otherwise, he denied any shortness of breath, cough,
fevers, chills, headache, or chest pain. He does report having
recent difficulty focusing his vision, new onset palpitations
earlier today which have since resolved, and constipation. He
also reports right sided abdominal pain which has become less
severe and increasing edema.
