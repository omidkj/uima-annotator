Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemetemesis, dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
42 year-old male with Type I diabetes, ESRD on HD, poorly
controlled HTN, diastolic CHF and multiple hospitalizations for
chronic left flank pain with negative work-up, recently admitted
for hypertensive crisis, now presents with hemetemesis, guaiac
positive stool and dyspnea.
.
Patient initially presented to the ED with his usual complaint
of left flank pain and also nausea/vomiting. Initial vital signs
were T 97.9 P 114 BP 230/122 R 20 O2sat 95% on RA. He was given
2 mg ativan, 4 mg morphine. He then started to have hemetemesis
about 20 cc and was noted to have guaiac positive stool. Patient
could not tolerate NG lavage. His O2 sat dropped to 85% on RA
and 92% on NRB with CXR showing pulmonary edema. Urgent dialysis
was planned. Central line was intially attempted on right groin
with no success. Left groin SCV was finally placed. Patient was
started on nitro gtt. Initial K was 5.3 without EKG changes.
.
MICU COURSE: The patient was dialyzed on [**1-15**] with 2L fluid
removed. The patient was dialyzed [**1-16**], UF 2L. The patient was
dialyzed [**1-17**], UF 2L. The patient had improvement in shortness
of breath. There were no further episodes of hematemesis. The
patient's groin site was noted to bleed but this resolved with
DDAVP [**1-16**].
.
Currently denies fevers, chills. Denies chest pain, shortness of
breath, cough. Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea. Denies melena, hematochezia.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year-old male with ESRD on HD, chronic left flank pain, Type
I diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension who presents with
hemetemesis, guaiac positive stool and hypoxia.
.
1. Hypoxia. Resolved soon after admission. CXR on admission
consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient's presentation was
likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema from hypertension and
fluid overload from dietary indiscretion. The patient's last
echocardiogram [**9-20**] showed mild diastoic dysfunction; mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF >55%). This was unlikely ischemic
with troponins trending down. The patient was dialyzed during
admission with removal of ~6 liters. The patient was maintained
on fluid restriction and low sodium diet. The patient was
continued on BB and ACEI.
.
2. Hematemesis/guaiac positive stool. The patient had no further
episodes of hematemesis during hospitalization. The patient's
hematocrit dropped slightly as above. The patient had grade III
esophagitis on EGD [**10-21**] likely secondary to vomiting from uremia
and diabetes. The patient underwent endoscopy prior to discharge
which showed diffuse patchy erosive gastritis. The patient's
guaiac positive stools were thought secondary to this upper GI
source. The patient was tolerating a regular diet prior to
discharge. The patient's protonix was changed from daily to
twice daily. The patient tolerated a regular diet prior to
discharge. The patient's aspirin was discontinued for now; the
patient will follow-up with his primary care doctor regarding
future use of aspirin.
.
3. Anemia/hematocrit drop. The patient's baseline hematocrit is
mid-30s; hematocrit was 40 on admission and was 30 at the time
of discharge. The drop was likely secondary to groin bleeds and
hemetemesis. The patient likely has a component of anemia from
chronic renal failure and iron studies in the past have been
consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
.
4. Groin bleed. The patient was status post multiple CVL
attempts in the ED. Hematocrit fell to 30 from baseline mid-30s.
Bleeding stopped status post DDAVP [**1-16**]. Bilateral US negative
for hematoma [**1-16**].
.
5. Diabetes, type I. Hemoglobin A1C 5.8 [**12-22**]. Complicated by
nephropathy, neuropathy. The patient's evening NPH was decreased
prior to discharge for hypoglycemia. The patient was continued
on reglan for nausea/vomiting thought secondary to diabetic
gastroparesis. The patient will follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] after
discharge.
.
6. ESRD secondary to diabetes. The patient was followed by renal
throughout admission. The patient's usual dialysis is T/Th/Sat.
The patient was dialyzed with removal ~6 liters. The patient was
continued on calcium acetate and lanthanum. The patient's
calcium acetate was increased prior to disc
