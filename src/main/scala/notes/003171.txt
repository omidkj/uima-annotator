Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital6 33**] for cord compression

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
XRT to spine

History of Present Illness:
69 year old man with past medical history significant for htn,
who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hosp on [**2167-12-19**] with
concern for thoracic cord compression. The pt originally
presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2167-12-15**] with a complaint of low
back pain and difficulty ambulating. He was sent for CT scan on
[**12-15**] and CT scan showed a large bulky soft tissue mass 13x12 cm
encasing the left kidney with extension into the pelvis,
partially encasing left common iliac artery. The pt returned
home on [**12-15**] with a prescription for Vicodin, but on [**12-16**] the pain
in the pt's back became too severe and on [**12-17**] he presented to
the [**Hospital3 **] ED. The pt reported that since [**Month (only) 1096**] he had
been experiencing anorexia, weight loss of 12 lbs, increasing
abdominal bloating and drenching night sweats.
.
At [**Hospital6 33**] the pt's VS were 97.8, P103, RR 18, BP
143/99, POx 94%on RA. On labs drawn in the ED the pt had a WBC
of 16.7, hct of 37.4, plts of 322, INR of 1.2, LDH of 3670, AST
of 126, Cr of 2.6, calcium of 13.5 and uric acid of 16. The pt
was admitted for management of acute renal failure, abdominal
mass concerning for lymphoma and hypercalcemia.
.
During his OSH hospitalization the pt was found to have low back
pain with difficulty ambulating and was evaluated by neurology
which recommended MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI of lumbar spine
showed marrow enhancement with evidence of cord compression from
L1 to T11. The pt was then transferred on [**2167-12-19**] for further
management of cord compression.
.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension

Social History:
The pt is an electrician. He lives with his wife and has 4 adult
children. He quit tobacco use 25 years ago.

Family History:
No family history of cancers, parents lived into 90's and died
of "old age."


Physical Exam:

GENERAL: Middle-aged man in NAD, laying in bed, falling asleep
occasionally during the interview.
HEENT: Oropharyngx clear, poor dentition, EOMI, PERRLA, no
cervical or clavicular LAD.
CARDIAC: RRR no m/g/r S1, S2 nl
LUNG: CTA anteriorly, no wheeze, rales or rhonchi
ABDOMEN: soft, NT/ND, no hepatosplenomegaly, bowel sounds
present
EXT: warm, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema
NEURO: A+O x3, CN II-XII intact
Motor: Symmetric strength in upper extremities, absent pronator
drift bilaterally, Diminished strength in bilateral lower
extremities, legs in frog-leg position, unable to lift legs off
bed, able to wiggle toes
[**Last Name (un) **]: Symmetric sensation bilateral upper and lower extremities.

DERM: Left forehead lesion with hypopigmentation and two nevi


Pertinent Results:
Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2167-12-19**]:
BONE MARROW EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED BY A HIGH-GRADE B CELL LYMPHOMA
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: a
Lambda restricted B cell lymphoma that co-expresses CD10.
Cytospin preparation of the FNA demonstrates a lymphoid
population that consists of large atypical cells with high N:C
ratio and some with cytoplasmic vacuoles.
.
MRI L spine [**2167-12-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Previously identified posterior, epidural lesion in the
region of
approximately T11 through L1 is not well evaluated on the
current study.
Repeat imaging at the T10 through L1 levels, with T1 and T2 pre-
and
post-gadolinium images is recommended.
2. Diffuse abnormal, heterogeneous signal seen throughout the
vertebral
bodies, most consistent with diffuse infiltration with lymphoma.
3. Low signal lesions consistent with previously seen lytic
metastases
identified within the iliac bones.
.
PE [**2167-1-13**] CT abdomen with contrast:
IMPRESSION
1. Acute-appearing right lower lobe lobar and segmental
pulmonary embolism.
Please note, this examination was not tailored to evaluate the
remainder of
the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
2. Distended gallbladder containing multiple gallstones and mild
pericholecystic fluid. These findings are suspicious for acute
cholecystitis. If clinical concern remains for acute
cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be of diagnostic benefit.
3. Left retroperitoneal mass encasing the left kidney and ureter
diagnosed by recent biopsy as B-cell lymphoma. Probably no
interval change in extent or appearance compared to CT of
[**2167-12-29**].
4. Delayed left renal nephrogram concerning for poor renal
function. Marked
hydroureteronephrosis suggesting an obstructive component to the
surrounding
mass, likely near the UVJ. Areas of ureteral wall irregularity
raise concern
for local invasion as described.
5. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
6. Possible bone lesion right iliac bone.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14966**] is a 70 year old man with past medical history
significant for hypertension, who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospitak on [**2167-12-19**] with concern for thoracic cord
compression who was found to have mantle cell lymphoma, blastic
variant.  He ultimately died in the ICU secondary to a GI bleed.
.
During this hospitalization the following issues were addressed:
.
#. GI bleed: The patient was transferred to the ICU three times
in the last week of his life.  The last two transfers were for
hematochezia/melena.  During the first of GI bleeds, the
decision was made for conservative management with platelets and
RBC transfusions per the wishes of the family.  Surgery and GI
were consulted during the first bleed and the family was aware
that EGD/colonoscopy were an option and the that IR would be an
option if he began to bleed briskly.  The family's goals at this
time were to stabilize the patient so that he could be well
enough to be discharged home to die. He was transferred back to
the floor and the following evening had a large bloody bowel
movement which prompted transfer back to the ICU.  He had a
brisk bleed and was transfused multiple units of RBCs,
platelets, and FFP.  He was then taken to IR for possible
embolization.  A family meeting took place and a decision was
made for the patient to become DNR/DNI and CMO.  He died later
that morning of respiratory arrest with his family at his
bedside.
.
# Mantle Cell Lymphoma, blastic variant: The pt had biopsy of
his retroperitoneal mass on admission, and the biopsy revealed a
high-grade lymphoma. Further pathology revealed likely Mantle
Cell Lymphoma, blastic variant. On [**2167-12-19**] the pt was started on
the [**Last Name (un) **] protocol, and on [**12-20**] the pt started radiation to
the spine.  Radiation to the spine concluded on [**2168-1-12**], pt. was
summarily started on [**Hospital1 **] treatment for DLBCL.  Developed
febrile neutropenia, CT torso demonstrated no areas of abscess,
pt. was started on neupogen, cefepime, vanc, and fluconazole.
Counts steadily increased and the patient underwent the
following regimen:
ICE: Tolerated without significant issue
Intrathecal Ara-C: After first round of intrathecal chemotherapy
patient experienced altered mental status which did improve
after one week.
.
# Tumor lysis syndrome:
The pt was initially in acute renal failure likely secondary to
tumor lysis syndrome. The pt received aggressive hydration and
rasburicase. Over the first few days of admission the pt's
electrolytes and uric acid returned to [**Location 213**] and the pt's renal
function returned to baseline.
.
# Pulmonary Embolus:
Pt. was complaining of pleuritic chest pain on [**2167-1-13**], localized
to the right upper quadrant.  Sent for Abdominal CT and
incidentally found RLL embolus, started on heparin prior to
cholecystecomy.  Heparin stopped and then restarted post
cholecystectomy and IVC filter on [**2168-1-16**].  Previous port site
with hematoma on [**2168-1-18**], heparin stopped.  Pt. developed hypoxia
to 84% on RA and
