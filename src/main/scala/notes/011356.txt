History of Present Illness:
44F with history of depression and EtOH abuse, presenting s/p
TCA overdose. Last seen by husband at midnight last night,
"passed out" in a chair, which he presumed was due to EtOH.
Snoring overnight, then when stopped snoring this AM he called
911 (also found suicide note. Uresponsive with EMS arrival.
Given narcan without effect. Intubated in the field. Had GTC en
route to OSH.
.
Patient arrived at OSH at 820am. First ECG with widened QRS of
~160. Initially hypotensive to 66/32. Further seizures there. At
some point a pill was found, which turned out to be doxepin.
Given IV bicarb. Initial venous pH 6.85 which trended up with
further bicarb. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.7 P114 BP98/52 R24 O2 sat 100%
on vent. Seized 8 times in ED. Femoral CVL placed. Regarding
ECGs, on arrival QRS 140, became as high as 160 and as low as
140. Patient was given more boluses IV bicarb - >20 amps, then
started on gtt. Also given 50 grams AC, 20% fat emulsion - 100ml
bolus x1 with later receiving 22.5 ml/min, diazepam 50 mg and
lorazepam 2mg. Also received 100 ml hypertonic saline. No
pressors. Before transfer up patient had WCT (QRS ~180) at HR
120s which looked more like VT; got lidocaine bolus - 100 mg and
second dose of intralipid.; QRS became more narrow.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient had two GTCs lasting < 1 minute

Brief Hospital Course:
44F with depression and EtOH abuse, s/p severe TCA overdose.
Multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
 Was admitted to the ICU then transferred to the Medicine floor.
 A brief description of her problems according to problem is
described below:
.
# TCA overdose.  Doxepin was found on scene.  Fit clinical
scenario with CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension
initially at OSH.  She received activated charcoal on transfer.
Toxicology was consulted immediately.  She received hypertonic
Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism,
intralipid infusion for improving volume of distribution.  She
was put on a Na bicarbonate drip to maintain pH > 7.45 and keep
QRS <130.  She was given 6 hours of interlipid.  She had regular
(initially q1hour) EKG's and ABG's and the NAHCO3 drip was
eventually weaned off.  Pt subsequently stablizied and EKGs
normalized.
.
# Respiratory failure.  Pt was intubated in field due to mental
status from med related CNS depression.  Later in the setting of
intensive vent requirements was found to have a MRSA pneumonia
as well, which was treated with IV vancomycin.  Was kept on vent
and weaned along with aggressive diuresis, finally being
extubated [**12-28**].  After extubation she had one day of marked
stridor that resolved with decadron and racemic epinephrin.  She
has since been breathing comfortably on room air.  Her sputum
cultures reflect MRSA colonization not infection as she is
without symptoms, fever or elevated WBC.
.
# Seizure: Most likely from TCA overdose and GABA receptor
antagonist activity.  No prior history of seizures known.  She
was started on propofol gtt and and TCA overdose was treated.
She was prescribed benzodiazepines for breakthrough seizures.
She had an EEG on HD1 that was interpreted as encephalopathy.
No seizures since.
.
# Suicidal Ideation: When patient awoke she immediately
expressed her wish to die.  She was evaluated by psychiatry who
felt she met section 12 criteria and required a 1:1.  At times
she showed symptoms of delirium without a clear organic cause.
She has subsequently improved in regards to her mood. Her affect
seems pleasant and she currently states that she does not have
suicidal ideation.
.
# Pancreatitis: Patient was found to have elevated lipase and
amylase [**12-27**] in the setting of low-grade fevers and
leukocytosis, most likely due to prolonged sedation with
propofol.  She was extubated the next day and taken off
propofol.  She improved clinically with no abdominal pain, was
advanced to regular diet with no problems.
.
# Hypo
