History of Present Illness:
71 year-old Female with h/o AFib (on coumadin), diastolic CHF,
HTN, DVT/PE, and stage III CKD who was recently admitted from
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2108-11-24**] for multifocal pneumonia, now transferred
back to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab with acutely worsening dyspnea
withdesaturation to 80's on room air and marked bilateral leg
swelling.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2109-11-24**] with dyspnea and found
to have multifocal healthcare-associated pneumonia. She was
treated with IV Vancomycin, and discharged on [**2109-12-2**] to rehab
to complete a 14-day course. She was also noted to have an acute
on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation which responded to gentle
diuresis, as well as an E. coli UTI which was treated with IV
cefipime (completed 10-day course). Per patient report and last
discharge summary, she was discharged from hospital off her
usual daily Lasix 20mg po daily prescription. At rehab on [**12-11**],
she was noted to be acutely dyspneic with desaturation to the
80s on room air, which improved to 100% on a non-rebreather. She
denied fevers, chills or chest pain. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS 97.0 (102 rectal) 70 168/73 20 100% NRB.
Patient was noted to be somnolent, and her CXR showed hazy
densities in the bilateral hila with moderate pulmonary edema
and small pleural effusions. She had some hypoglycemia after
receiving insulin in the ED and was placed on D50, and also
received a CT head which was unremarkable. She was started on
BiPAP because of acute hypoxic respiratory distress. She was
given Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL x 1 for afterload reduction. ABG
(on BiPAP) 7.42/39/219. She was subsequently admitted to the
MICU for respiratory distress.
.
On arrival in the MICU, pt was initially found to be somnolent
but arousable. Patient was given Lasix 20mg IV x 2 with some
response. Creatinine subsequently bumped from 1.9 to 2.1.  She
received 500 cc D10W for her hypoglycemia with good response to
blood sugars 200s.
.
On the floor, patient states that she is not currently dyspneic.
 She reports no fevers or chills.  There is no chest pain noted.
 She does note some increased swelling of her legs.  She does
report a dry [**Hospital1 **].
.
ROS: Denies headaches or vision changes. Denies chest pain,
dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations. No nausea or
vomiting, denies abdominal pain. No dysuria or hematuria. Denies
muscle weakness, myalgias or neurologic complaints.

STUDIES:
PA PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ([**2109-12-11**]): As similar to multiple prior
exams, there is a relative hazy density in the bilateral hilar
regions with pulmonary vascular indistinctness. The
hemidiaphragms are not well defined. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is markedly enlarged with widening superiorly and an
enlarged cardiac silhouette
inferiorly. The patient's chin overlies the lung apices,
limiting the
evaluation. No gross pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to body habitus. There are low
lung volumes which resul
