History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old female with no significant PMH who
presented to PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days of RUQ pain, nausea and
vomiting after meals.  She was admitted from the office and
underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**2193-10-22**] for
acute cholecystitis.  Intraoperative cholangiogram was not done.
The pt was discharged home on POD2 with an uncomplicated
hospital stay.  On POD8, the pt returned to the office with
repeat episodes of acute RUQ pain, elevated LFTs, amylase and
lipase; an abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a normal caliber
CBD. On [**2193-10-30**] an ERCP with sphincterotomy, stent placement,
stone extraction was done.  Again the pt was discharged home.
On [**2193-11-7**], however, she returned with acute onset epigastric
pain, radiating to the back.  The pt was again admitted and CT
demonstrated a new pancreatic pseudocyst.  She was started on
antibiotics.  A PICC was placed, and she was started on TPN.
This hospitalization was complicated by a pulmonary embolus on
[**11-13**], at which time a heparin drip was started.  Repeat CT
demonstrated multiple pancreatic pseudocysts.  Diagnostic tap on
[**11-13**] demonstrated budding yeast and the patient was started on
antifungals per ID.  The pt was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  At the time of transfer the pt was on TPN, heparin
drip, and vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2193-11-18**] 10:41 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary emboli as noted above within segment arteries of
the right lower lobe. Pleural effusions and pulmonary
parenchymal atelectasis and airspace disease as noted.
2. Multiple large pancreatic pseudocysts including left hepatic
subcapsular psuedocysts. The pancreatic parenchyma in the body
is replaced by the pseudocyst but the tail, head, and uninate
process enhance.
3. Thrombosis of the splenic vein with collaterals. No splenic
artery aneurysm.

with a new right upper lobe segmental artery thrombus, but
resolution of the previously described right lower lobe
thrombus.
3. Interval stable large left pleural effusion, with interval
resolution of the right pleural effusion.
