History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33667**] is a 79 year old male with past medical history of
recent aortic aneurysm repair, complicated by ischemic bowel and
sepsis, also with history of coronary artery disease who
presents from rehabilitation today with hypoxia. Per report from
the ED, patient was reported to be not feeling well and
intermittently confused over the weekend. Today an oxygen
saturation was checked and it was reported to be 70%, so EMS was
called. Of note, patient was started on Remeron recently, which
was felt to initially be the etiology of his symptoms.
.
In the ED, initially his blood pressure was 90/ . A chest x-ray
was completed that demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia. He
was given 750 mg of levofloxacin, and started on some
intravenous fluids.
.
On the floor ABG: 7.47/43/77, tachypnic, tachycardic, triggered.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.

[**2201-6-2**] CXR: Left basilar opacity which could represent
atelectasis or
pneumonia with a small to moderate-sized left pleural effusion,
increased in the interval.

[**2201-6-4**] CT chest:
1. No pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
2. Small right and moderate left nonhemorrhagic layering
bilateral pleural
effusion, increased since [**2201-5-15**]. Complete collapse of the
left lower
lobe, collapse of basilar segments of the right lower lobe, and
dependent
opacities in both upper lobes, likely atelectasis.
3. Signs of mild interstitial edema. Mild upper lobe predominant
emphysema.
4. Severe coronary artery calcifications. Prior CABG. Minimal
aortic valve
calcifications, of unknown hemodynamic significance.

[**2201-6-4**] CT head:
1. No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage,
edema, or mass. MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]-weighted imaging is most
sensitive for evaluation of acute infarction.
2. Right corona radiata hypodensities, most likely representing
chronic
lacunar infarcts.
3. Paranasal sinus disease as described above.

[**2201-6-4**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Increasing size of loculated fluid collection in the left
retroperitoneal space since [**2201-5-15**] without evidence of rim
enhancement to suggest abscess. This likely represents loculated
hematoma. There is no evidence of active extravasation.
2. Stable post colostomy bowel without evidence of obstruction.
3. No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm leak post repair.

[**2201-6-4**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= XX %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2201-3-23**], the left ventricular dysfunction seems
to be more global on the current study. No vegetations
identified. If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation
by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

[**2201-6-5**] UENI: No evidence of DVT involving the bilateral upper
extremities.
Somewhat limited evaluation of the right cephalic vein, which
compresses
normally.

[**2201-6-5**] LENI: Normal bilateral lower extremity ultrasound
examination. No
evidence of DVT.

[**2201-6-8**] Renal U/S:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Known mid to upper pole complex cystic lesion in the left
kidney, seen on prior CT, is not well seen and is incompletely
evaluated on this study.

[**2201-6-10**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Bilateral effusions and atelectasis. Mild ascites and
anasarca.
2. Decreased size of the previously described left
retroperitoneal fluid
collection, with residual phlegmonous inflammation extending to
the left
flank soft tissue defect. Given rapid decrease in size of this
collection,
spontaneous decompression and drainage via the left flank wound
is most
likely.
3. Unchanged size of complex left upper pole renal cyst likely
hemorrhagic/inflammatory change involving previously identified
simple renalcyst.
4. Unchanged appearance of the stomach, small bowel, and
residual ascending
and proximal transverse colon, which terminates in a right lower
quadrant end colostomy.
5. Unremarkable appearance of the rectal stump, with no pelvic
abscess
identified.
6. Bilateral fat- and fluid-containing inguinal hernias.

[**2201-6-12**] CXR:
Increased bilateral pleural effusions and likely relaxation
atelectasis. To evaluate possible pulmonary edema, recommend
conventional PAand lateral.


Brief Hospital Course:
79-year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]),
complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from
the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
