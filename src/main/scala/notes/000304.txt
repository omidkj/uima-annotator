Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4071**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with a stent placed in the left anterior
descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] is an 87 yo woman with h/o 3 vessel CAD s/p multiple
PCIs, complete heart block s/p pacer, who presents after an
episode of chest pain.  She has trouble sleeping usually, and
when she awoke at 4am, she noted substernal pressure in the
lower chest at about [**7-24**]. She took 1 nitroglycerin sublingual
tablet which did not help.  She denied shortness of breath and
nausea, but she did have 1 episode of vomiting.  She states that
she was experiencing diaphoresis prior to the pain, but she has
had night sweats for over a year regularly. The pain lasted
until about 10am, after which her son called EMS to bring her to
the ED.

In the ED, initial Vital Signs were T 98.1  BP 123/74  HR 62  RR
16   O2Sat 100%.   Troponin was positive at 1.05 with CK of 391
and MB of 42.  She was given plavix 300mg and started on a
heparin gtt and was guaiac Neg.

Upon arrival to the floor, patient denies chest pain, shortness
of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  She admits to decreased
appetite for many months and 25 lb loss (200lbs --> 175lbs) in
the last seven months, though stable weight for the last [**2-15**]
months.  She endorses nightsweats for over a year off and on.
She has a little cough for the last couple of years which has
been stable, but she reports no recent coughing; she has been
using cough syrup for the last couple of years. The cough
sometimes has phlegm. She has difficulty swallowing and has
difficulty chewing because of no teeth.

She endorses ankle edema, joint pain and body pain "all over"
chronicly.  She denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea.  She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies urinary symptoms and diarrhea but states that she
doesn't urinate much in general; she doesn't drink much fluid.

EKG:
In the ED:
Atrial pacing. Twave inversions in V2-V4, Twave flattening in
V5, V6, I, aVL. Prolonged QTc (471).

Compared to prior EKG from [**2170-5-11**]: A-V paced rhythm w left
axis, wide QRS.

Prior EKG from [**11-17**]: Ectopic atrial rhythm w normal axis; the
precordial Twave inversions and lateral flattening are not
present.

CXR [**2171-9-14**]: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

TTE [**2171-9-16**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of the distal
half of the anterior septum and anterior wall. The apex is
mildly dyskinetic. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 30-35 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2166-7-23**], new regional left ventricular systolic
function is now present c/w interim infarction/ischemia.

Cardiac cath [**2171-9-16**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
3 vessel CAD. The LMCA was large, ectatic, with mild disease.
The
proximal LAD was large, ectatic with mild disease. The mid LAD
was
heavily calcified and subtotally occluded, with serial 80-90%
stenosis
more distally. The distal LAD had a 50% stenosis and apical LAD
had an
80% stenosis. The D1 had a 50% origin stenosis. D2 had a 50%
origin
stenosis. THe LCX was a small caliber (2mm) diffusely diseased
vessel
with an 80% origin stenosis but supplied very little LV. The RCA
had an
upward takeoff with a mid-vessel 20% ISR and more diffuse
disease
distally. The RPDA had serial 50% stenoses.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with a 3.0 x 24mm
Driver
bare metal stent and POBA of the distal LAD with a 2.5 x 20 NC
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 108633**]. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the
stent, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow. (see PTCA

comments for details.)
3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial
hypertension
(153/65 mmHg), mild pulmonary arterial hypertension (38/19/26
mmHg),
and mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (mean
RAP
11mmHg, RVEDP 13 mmHg, mean PCWP 13 mmHg). Cardiac index was
severely
depressed (1.6 L/min/m2).
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
