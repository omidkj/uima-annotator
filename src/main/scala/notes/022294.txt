CXR: FINDINGS: Stent material is visualized in the course of the
right subclavian and brachiocephalic veins. There is no focal
consolidation or effusion. The mediastinal contours and
pulmonary vascular markings are normal. The heart size is normal
as well. Some previously seen atelectatic changes on the prior

course of cefepime. improved hypoxia. Pt developed podagra, and
was given a course of steroids. She developed leukocytosis with
5% bands. This was felt to be due to RUE ucler growing out coag
+staph- oxacillin sensitive/diptheroids at site of AV Graft. U/S
showed no abcess and pt received vanco per transplant surgery
recs. Upon further evaluation of wound by transplant surgery,
this was not felt to be an active issue.

With Renal failure, renal decided to restart hemodialysis (she
