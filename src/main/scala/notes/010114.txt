Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Mechanical Fall/R Hip Fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Fixation with short trochanteric fixation nail (TFN) and
cephalomedullary nail, 11 x 170 x 130.


History of Present Illness:
82 year old with COPD, non-small cell lung cancer s/p RUL
lobectomy, MI s/p stent placement, likely diastolic CHF and
prostate cancer admitted on [**7-3**] for right femoral neck fracture
after a mechanical fall. Patient originally presented to OSH and
was subsequently transferred here for further evaluation and
treatment of hip fracture.

Of note patient has severe COPD at baseline that has worsened
during this time, also. He generally walks without assistance,
hunched over and is unable to climb more than one flight of
stairs without significant SOB, able to walk across a room but
slowly. Patient and family states his limitation with exertion
is all pulmonary (dyspnea, weakness) and he has not had any
chest pain, sore throat, presyncope, syncope with any exertion.

In the ED initial VST 97.8, HR78, BP 152/77, RR12, O2Sat96% on
RA. Pelvis and Femur imaging confirmed right femur fracture.
Orthopedics Surgery evaluated the patient in the ED and
recommended admission to Medicine for comorbidity management,
pre-operative risk stratification.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y.o. man with a history of COPD, lung cancer s/p lobectomy,
MI s/p stenting, diastolic CHF who presented with R hip fracture
now POD7 s/p repair who was transferred several times to the
MICU for SOB/hypercarbic respiratory failure and eventually
developed a high-grade small bowel obstruction for which he was
eventually made comfort measures only and extubated.
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure / COPD:
He was known to have an FEV1 of 26% of expected in [**2145**]. On
POD1, he developed tachypnea, O2 desaturations into the 80s
which responded to mask ventilation, and an ABG showing pH 7.27
and pCO2 67 (baseline is in the 50s, reportedly). The original
differential for his respiratory failure was broad, including
PE, PNA, flash pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure, and
a-fib. PE and pneumonia were ruled-out with a CT-A Chest.
Cardiac etiology was possible given that he was intermittently
going into a-fib and has a history of CHF. He also did not
appear volume overloaded on exam. Atelectasis and lobectomy may
have contributed to SOB but does not explain symptoms alone. Pt
improved significantly on IV steroids, BIPAP, and nebs in the
MICU.  He was weaned off of his BIPAP down to 3L NC for O2
requirement by POD2. Solumedrol was transitioned to prednisone
40 mg PO the day following his hypercarbic respiratory failure
and he was transferred to the medical floor.

He was transferred again to the MICU on the night of [**7-8**] for
desaturations following working with the physical therapy team.
He was stabilized in the MICU without intervention and worked
with PT here. He was transferred back to the floor again.  He
was then transferred back to the MICU given worsening
respiratory distress likely [**2-11**] small bowel obstruction (see
below) for which he was intubated. On [**7-12**], g
