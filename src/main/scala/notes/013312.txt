seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) 282**] tube placement

History of Present Illness:
30 y/o F with complicated PMH of cerebral palsy, seizure
disorder, myoclonus, asthma and hypothyroidism who presents with
a new seizure and fever. She had a reported 10 generalized
tonic-clonic seizures, a fever to 104. In the ambulance, 2mg of
ativan broke her seizure activity. Unclear history as to whether
or not she was having diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, or any other complaints. She was intubated and
sedated at this time.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 104.3, BP 122/77, P 142, R 21
and 99% on RA. She received Fentanyl and midazolam for
intubation. She had a CXR that showed proper positioning of her
ET tube. She received vancomycin 1 gm x1, cefepime 1 gm x1 and
flagyl 500 mg x1. She was initially ordered for IV keppra, but
she did not receive it in the ED. She was started on a
norepinephrine drip for hypotension. She had a CT head which did
not show any intracranial pathology. She had a CT abdomen that
showed pan-colitis.
.
On the floor, she is intubated and sedated; she is unresponsive
to painful stimuli. We are decreasing her sedation. She is
ventilating well on AC.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU COURSE:

# Seizure:  Patient reported to have seizure.  Likely secondary
to the fever from the presumed colitis or other infectious
etiology, given the fever. Head CT was performed and did not
show any anatomical changes. LP was deferred in the ED. She has
an underlying seizure disorder (possibly from mitochrondrial
dysfunction per prior notes) which has not been well controlled.
Neuro saw her in the ED and recommended standing ativan after
extubation for seizure prophylaxis.  Her home seizure
medications were continued as patient was transferred to the
ICU.  EEG monitoring was also started.  A workup for possible
mitochondrial disorders explaining her seizure history was also
started.  According to recs by Neurology, CSF lactate
dehydrogenase and pyruvate were ordered.  A muscle biopsy by
Neurosurg was also planned.  Levels of Valproic Acid,
lamotrigine, and levitiracepam were also taken.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Patient thought to have
aspirated in the setting of her seizures.  She had depressed
mental status while post-ictal.  Intubation was performed for
airway protection.  There was evidence of aspiration on CXR.
She was started on continuous mechanical ventilation to await
better seizure control.  Antibiotic coverage for aspiration
pneumonia was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  Patient's
respiratory distress improved, and the ventilatory settings were
successfuly decreased.  The patient was ready for extubation by
the end of ICU stay, but the ventilator was kept on for imminent
muscle biopsy.
.
# Colitis:  There was unclear symptomatic history of
diarrhea/abd pain upon admission.  She has had frequent
hospitalizations and is at risk of c.diff, but the patient did
not have marked leukocytosis upon admission.  An initial CT of
the abdomen was read as having pancolitis.  The patient was
started PO vanc (avoiding cipro/flagyl because they  lower
seizure threshold).  Stool studies were sent off for C diff.
The final read of the CT, however, indicated likely
gastroenteritis rather than pancolitis.  PO vancomycin was
stopped before discharge from ICU.

# Hypotension:  The patient arrived to the unit with low blood
pressures.  This was thought to be secondary to septic shock
from colitis vs. hypovolemia from diarrhea.  Also possible were
insensible losses vs. medication induced hypotension from
fent/versed gtts.  The patient was started on levophed and
aggressive fluid resuscitation (CVP>10, UOP>30).  The patient
did not require pressure support by the second day in the ICU
and remained normotensive.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 11 Kathyanne was stable.  She became more
awake and alert as  time went on.  The decision was made that a
PEB tube would be the best for Kathyanne due to her progressive
problems swallowing.  Upon discussion with psychiatry it was
found that the patient was competant to make the decision to
have a [**Hospital Ward Name 282**] placed.  The procedure was also discussed with the
patients [**Doctor Last Name **] mother.  The patient decided that a [**Doctor Last Name 282**] would be
best. The patient was consented by GI.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] mother was
also noted to sign a health care proxy. The [**Name2 (NI) 282**] was placed on
[**2117-8-18**].  That evening the patient had low blood pressure that
responded to IV fluids. On [**2117-8-19**] the patient was noted to be
stable.  Her pain was well controlled. Feeds were started.
Medications switched to PO/NG.  At that point is was decided
that the patient would go home with a visiting nurse to care for
the [**Date Range 282**] tube. On the day of discharge the patient's guardian
received [**Name2 (NI) 282**] teaching.  [**Known firstname 59857**] was doing well and cleared to
go home.
