Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ASD repair
Impella placement

History of Present Illness:
48YOM incarcerated, with hx of recently diagnosed
hemochromatosis associated to with long standing DM2 and liver
cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, portal
hypertension and esophageal varices who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 620**] ED with presyncope and dyspnea; was found to be hypoxic
hypotensive with SBP 60s and started on levophed. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, given IVF and transferred to the
ICU. On admission, he endorsed stiff neck, sore throat,
headache, dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and pleuritic chest
pain. A CT was notable for a filling defect consistent with
chronic pulmonary embolism versus lymph node as well as signs of
colitis or pancreatitis. He was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics. His initial ECG was read as loss of R-wave
progression. He was maintained on levophed overnight but
switched to dobutamine this AM as concern for cardiogenic shock
increased. His hypoxia also progressed, necessitating intubation
this AM.
.
Cardiac review of symptoms are unobtainable as the patient is
intubated.
.
The current work up has revealed cardiogenic shock of unkown
ethiology, noted to have newly reduced LVEF ejection
fraction(down to 10-20% from 40%) with no evidence of
vegetations or severe valvulopathy, noted to have an ASD on
bubble study. There is no evidece of aotic disection on CTA, and
cardiac enzimes are in the indeterminate range. Infectious work
up has been negative so far and there is not a clear cause for
the hypoxia althought he Ct showed subsegmental chronic PE. S/P
ASD repair and Impala placement.

EKG: NSR @ 99; TWI in 1 & AVL. EKG from [**11-22**] w/ TWI in V3-V6.

ECHO [**2151-11-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal LV segments
and akinesis of the distal [**2-16**] of the LV. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
15-20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen,
but is probably underestimated. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction
with some regionality. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Elevated filling pressures. Among other etiologies, these
findings could be consistent with a global process (septic,
toxic, metabolic) or a variant of acute stress (Takotsubo)
cardiomyopathy. Multivessel coronary artery disease as the sole
etiology of these abnormalities is less likely.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2149-3-11**], biventricular systolic dysfunction and
tricuspid regurgitation are new.
.
ECHO with bubble study [**2151-11-24**]: A right-to-left shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest with prompt appearance of
contrast in the left heart after intravenous injection c/w an
atrial septal defect.
.
CTA 11/10/09IMPRESSION:
1. Peripheral filling defect in the posterior segment branch of
the lower lobe pulmonary artery may represent a chronic
pulmonary embolism versus lymph node.No other filling defects
are seen.
2. Severe liver cirrhosis with recanalization of the umbilical
vein and varices adjacent to the gastroesophageal junction and
moderate intra-abdominal ascites.
3. Apparent wall thickening of the ascending colon may be
related to liver disease and intra-abdominal ascites; however
colitis cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is recommended.
4. Peripancreatic fluid may be related to liver disease; however
pancreatitis is not entirely excluded and correlation with
amylase, lipase is recommended.
5. Bilateral small pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis
-
consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo male at baseline immunosupressed given DM and
hemochromatosis, presented with sudden onset of severe
cardiogenic shock of unknown etiology.  The likelihood of
multivessel disease is low given the acute change in his EF and
lack of signficant changes on ECG.  He had significant decreased
EF within the past couple of month is of unknown etiology.  This
could be due to an infectious vs. progression of hemachromatosis
with new diagnosed ASD vs metabolic vs toxic related
cardiomyopathy. In regard to ASD, this created a R->L shunt in
the setting of chronic PE, hemachromatosis, and pulmonary
hypertension.  Due to the shunting he had respiratory failure
that was initially unresponsive to oxygen.  Respiratory status
was improved after ASD closure, however, his hemodynamics were
still poor.  He had been spiking fevers without an obvious
source (Head/Neck CT has been negative and CSF has been
negative). He was placed on cipro/zosyn/vanc for generalized
bacterial infection, clindamycin for coverage of toxic shock and
doxycycline for atypical source.  Multiple serologies were sent.
 After ASD repair, he also had a Impella device placed.  This
has helped his cardiac output, but did not help overall his
cardiogenic/septic
