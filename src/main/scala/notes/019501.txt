CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral hip and calf claudication.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41 year old diabetic
with multiple risk factors and known coronary artery disease
referred for peripheral vascular angiography due to severe
bilateral leg claudication.  He complains that his calf and
thighs "ache 24 hours a day" over the past six months.  He
has had progression in his symptoms.  He describes bilateral
severe cramping behind both knees extending down to the feet.
This occurred after walking only 20 feet.  The patient does
not admit to rest pain.  The patient underwent PVRs which
demonstrated distal superficial femoral artery, proximal
popliteal disease with bilateral tibial disease.  The patient
is admitted for elective diagnostic angiography.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia,
diabetes, hypothyroidism, left shoulder bursitis and
peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2124**],
laser surgery on both eyes.

ALLERGIES:  Vancomycin.  Negative to shellfish and dye.

1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily
2.  Lipitor 80 mg daily
3.  Tricor 67 mg daily
4.  Toprol XL 250 mg daily
5.  Plavix 75 mg daily
6.  Levoxyl .15 mg daily
7.  Zestril 40 mg daily
8.  Norvasc 20 mg daily
9.  Prevacid 30 mg daily
10. Imdur 60 mg q.d.
11. Lente insulin 17 units q AM and 8 units at supper
12. Regular insulin sliding scale before meals
13. Mirapex .125 mg at h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is divorced, former smoker, 1.5 packs per
day times 28 years.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count revealed white count
8.2, hematocrit 38.7, platelets 227.  BUN 49, creatinine 2.1,
potassium 5.0, INR normal.  Electrocardiogram showed a sinus
rhythm with a normal axis with inferolateral ischemic
appearing ST segment depressions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is a 41 year old male in
no acute distress.  His vital signs are stable.  His head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is unremarkable
except for a right carotid bruit probably secondary to murmur
radiation.  There is no jugulovenous distension.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  There are no bruits.  Bowel sounds are
present.  Pulse examination as follows:  Femoral on the right
1+ with a bruit, left femoral 1+ with a bruit, dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial are dopplerable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
after undergoing an arteriogram which demonstrated mild
infrarenal abdominal aortic disease.  The renals were
bilaterally single with right stenosis of 60% and left
stenosis of 40%.  Right lower extremity showed mild ostial
disease in the right common iliac of 40 to 50%.  The right
superficial femoral artery had moderate segmental lesions of
50%.  The popliteal was patent.  Anterior tibial had mild
diffuse disease to the foot.  The TPT with moderate diffuse
disease.  The posterior tibial was occluded and reconstituted
from peroneal collaterals.  The left lower extremity showed
iliac artery was patent but the left common femoral was
normal.  The proximal left superficial femoral artery was 70%
stenosed the popliteal was patent, anterior tibial was
proximally occluded, the posterior tibial and peroneal were
patent to the foot.  The proximal vessels had moderate severe
diffuse disease.  After these findings Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] was
consulted.  The patient was cleared by his cardiologist and
did serial CKs and electrocardiograms postoperatively.
Endocrinology was consulted perioperatively for diabetic
management.  The patient underwent on [**10-28**], a left
femoral distal popliteal tibia with in situ saphenous vein
and venovenostomy.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit with a
dopplerable posterior tibial and faint dopplerable dorsalis
pedis.  He was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit for continued monitored care.  He required an additional
unit of packed red blood cells, infusion for his hematocrit
of 26.5.  He will receive 6 units of packed red blood cells
intraoperatively.  The patient required Neo for pressor
support.  Serial CKs, MBs and troponins were drawn.  His
initial troponin level was less than .3, the second level was
9.3 with a peak CK of 261 and MB of 6.  The patient's diet
was advanced as tolerated and he was transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and
care.  His creatinine bumped to 3.8 with oliguria.  He was
transfused for a hematocrit of 30.  Neo was weaned for
maintaining blood pressure greater than 160.  Cardiology was
requested to evaluate the patient with recommendations during
the perioperative management.  Recommendations were to
reinstitute his nitrates, Norvasc and beta blockers.  Most of
this increased creatinine was probably secondary to his
diload.  The patient was finally transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #2.  On postoperative day #3 the patient
continued to show improvement showing a temperature maximum
of 101.5.  Hematocrit was 27.1.  BUN was 27 and creatinine
2.4, down from a peak of 4.0.  The cardiac medications were
continued and Lopressor was increased and he required
diuresis.  The patient was pancultured of blood and urine.
He was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The patient
went into pulmonary edema and was re-intubated and
transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on
[**11-1**].  Tube feeds were begun on postoperative day #4
and the rate was advanced as the patient tolerated.  He
required two units of packed cells on postoperative day #5
for hematocrit of 24.  Cardiology continued to follow the
patient during this period of time.  Cultures on urine were
negative and sputum were negative.  Chest x-ray showed some
lateral infiltrates.  The patient's platelets continued to
remain low even post transfusion, platelets intraoperatively
and HIT was sent which was negative, so impression was that
it was related to a drug reaction.  Blood cultures remained
negative.  Central venous pressure tip catheter remained
negative but sputum did grow out gram positive cocci.  The
patient was continued on his Levofloxacin.  Tricor was
discontinued as considered a possible reason for the
thrombocytopenia.  Post transfusion hematocrit remained
stable at 30.3.  BUN and creatinine continued to show a
downward trend of 22 and 1.7.  Oxygen was finally weaned off
on [**10-26**], which was postoperative day #7 and the patient
was extubated.  The patient again was transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit.  The tube feels were
discontinued on [**11-5**] and he began p.o. intakes.  His
insulin regime was adjusted as necessary.  The patient
continued to see improvement and he was discharged from the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #9 in
stable condition.  Wounds were clean, dry and intact.  He had
dopplerable distal pulses.  The patient was discharged on one
five day course of Levofloxacin.  He should follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding anticoagulation.  He should follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] in two weeks.
