Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 5282**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
48 year old male with chronic hepatitis C complicated by
cirrhosis, gastric variceal bleed, TIPS placement, ascites,
peripheral edema and hepatic encephalopathy with 1 day ago
developed sudden, constant, bilateral, [**8-4**] sharp abdominal
pain. Wife notes that patient has had 2 week history of
increasing drowsiness, skin jaundice and 1 episode of transient
abdominal pain with nausea, emesis x1 of non-bloody fluid last
week, repeat episode nausea, emesis 1 day ago. He was able to go
grocery shopping with his wife 2 days ago. 1 day ago went to
primary care provider for what he thought to be a pulled left
groin/thigh muscle. After returning home, developed abdominal
pain and presented to [**Location (un) 8641**] ED. +flatus, last BM 1 day ago.

At [**Location (un) 8641**] ED, patient WBC elevated to 12.4 with left shift and
bandemia. RUQ ultrasound showed TIPS with some gallstones and
thickening of the gallbladder wall with a small amount of
pericholecystic fluid. His CBD was noted to be 5mm. CT scan of
the abdomen/pelvis showed TIPS in the liver as well as some
thickening of the gallbladder wall and the gallstones as
mentioned; no other source was noted for the abdominal
discomfort.

Patient was admitted to [**Location (un) 8641**] ICU for questionable
cholecystitis vs choledocholithiasis and underwent evaluation by
GI and surgery whom agreed with plan to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

STUDIES:

[**2160-12-30**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2159-10-19**] the rate has increased. Otherwise,
no diagnostic interim change.

[**2160-12-31**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. No definite
evidence of diastolic dysfunction found. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2160-1-3**], estimated pulmonary artery
pressure is now higher. No evidence of ASD is seen in either
study.

[**2160-12-31**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the
previous tracing there is no significant change.

[**2160-12-31**] CXR: Lungs are fully expanded and clear. No pleural
effusion. Heart size top normal. Vascular clips and stents
denote prior upper abdominal surgery, perhaps TIPS as well.

[**2160-12-31**] ABD ULTRASOUND with Doppler:
1. Small volume lumen of the gallbladder, which folds upon
itself and has
mobile stones within it. The appearance is unchanged from the
study obtained two days prior. Although, there is gallbladder
wall edema, given the lack of changes, lack of distention and
the mobility of the calculi, these findings are unlikely to
represent acute cholecystitis. In this patient's setting of
decreased albumin and elevated LFTs/bilirubin, the gallbladder
wall edema is more likely secondary to chronic hepatic disease.
2. Liver morphology consistent with cirrhosis.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. patent TIPS shunt.

[**2161-1-1**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. The tracing is within normal
limits and unchanged from tracing of [**2161-1-2**].

[**2161-1-2**] Right heart cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization demonstrated elevated right sided
filling pressures with mean RAP 14mmHg and RVEDP 24mmHg. There
was mild to moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (48/20mmHg,
mean 35mmHg). Mean PCWP was modestly elevated at 29mmHg.
Pulmonary vascular resistance was not elevated
