Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7729**]
Chief Complaint:
voice hoarseness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p tracheostomy & tracheostomy change (on POD7)


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with metastatic breast cancer,
s/p right modified radical mastectomy ([**2112**]) and chemo/XRT.  In
[**2120-5-7**] she had a contralateral axillary mass which was
removed and revealed metastatic breast cancer which was erp
positive. A left simple mastectomy was performed and no tumor
was identified. She took Tamoxifen from [**2120-5-7**] until it was
discontinued in [**2134-5-8**]. In [**2135-5-8**] she developed a
paralyzed vocal cord and a mediastinal mass was identified. This
was positive on biopsy and therapy with Arimidex was begun. The
tumor mass shrunk and her voice improved.

In [**2139-6-7**], patient began experiencing voice hoarseness and
symptoms which had been attributed to GERD. An EGD was suggested
but deferred until after her return. Unfortunately, she had
substantial progression of these symptoms. Her Protonix had been
increased to [**Hospital1 **] and her hoarseness had worsened. More worrisome
was her husband's report that when she sleeps on her back she is
making loud respiratory noises with each breath. This abates if
she
moves on her side. A PET scan done a few days ago shows FDG
avidity in the left axillae and in a large anterior cervical
node as well as in a mass which surrounds and compresses the
trachea. An urgent EGD was performed which showed only mild
gastritis. An ENT examination by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**]
revealed bilateral paralyzed vocal cords and substantial
tracheal narrowing due to external tumor progression.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to ENT surgery service on [**2139-7-9**] after
undergoing tracheostomy.  No concerning intraoperative events
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details.  She
was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and airway
management.  She was tolerating trach collar trials without
difficulty.  She had adequate pain control and was tolerating
sips on POD1 and was advanced to regular soft diet by POD0.  Her
incision was C/D/I, with no evidence of hematoma collection or
infection.

Patient was deemed stable for transfer to the floor on POD2 (but
remained in ICU for bed availability limitations until POD4).
She was evaluated by Speech Therapy and failed initial trials
with speaking (Passy-Muir) valve, but was able to speak with
finger occlusion.

Trach was changed on POD7 in the operating room to a Shiley #6
cuffless/fenestrated trach, which she tolerated well.  Speech
Therapy reevaluated the patient on POD8 and fitted the patient
with a Passy-Muir speaking valve.

The patient underwent her initial chemotherapy and radiation
therapy treatments during this admission, which she tolerated
well.  She was given explicit instructions for follow-up by the
appropriated services.

The remainder of the hospital course was relatively
unremarkable, and she was discharged in stable condition,
ambulating and voiding independently, and with adequate pain
control.  She was given explicit instructions to follow-up in
clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] in [**2-8**] weeks.  VNA services were
arranged for tracheostomy care, home teaching, and skilled
nursing for wound evaluation.
