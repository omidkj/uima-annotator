Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
Sore throat, coryza symptoms

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement
Bone Marrow Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
51 yo male presents with 1 week history of sore throat and URI
type symptoms.  He presented to an OSH where he was noted to
have leukocytosis (WBC >70K) and given concern for hematologic
malignancy, he was transferred here for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.2, 98, 138/67, 20, 94%.
Hematology evaluated the patient, and a peripheral smear was
consistent with likely AML.  Bone marrow biopsy was performed,
and the patient was then initiated on leukopheresis prior to
admission.  In the ED, he also received 3 gm hydroxyuria,
allopurinol, bicarb, as well as levofloxacin for ? PNA on his
CXR.
.
Currently, the patient feels better.  He reports brownish
productive sputum.  He saw his PCP on Wednesday, and since his
lungs were clear, he was told to continue on his OTC coricidin.
His symptoms continued to worsen which is why he presented to
the ED.  He states he's also had nightsweats for the last week.
.
On ROS, he denies fevers, chills, weight change, visual changes,
headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation,
BRBPR, melena, dysuria, hematuria, frequency, urgency, numbness,
weakness, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.  He does
report some increased dyspnea this past week as well as a few
episodes of diarrhea.

Imaging:
ECHO [**2175-8-21**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2175-8-21**]: IMPRESSIONS: Unchanged bibasilar opacities.
.
CT Chest [**2175-8-24**]
IMPRESSIONS:

1. Diffuse right pleural thickening with sparing of the medial
pleural
surface together with tiny right pleural effusion likely account
for the CXR appearance. Together with shift of the mediastinum
towards the right,
fibrothorax is a possibility, especially if the patient has had
prior pleural disease. Comparison with older imaging may be
helpful in establishing chronicity. Otherwise, follow up CT in 3
months may be helpful to ensure stability.

2. Diffuse ground-glass attenuation of the lungs with smooth
septal
thickening can be seen in hydrostatic edema, but also in
atypical infections such as viral or pneumocystis pneumonia.

3. Borderline enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes may be
reactive
but attention at follow up CT suggested.

4. Splenomegaly with splenic infarct.

5. Possible left renal hypodensity, which may represent either
renal lesion or renal infarct. This could be evaluated by renal
US if warranted clinically.
.
CT sinus [**2175-8-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mucosal thickening involving maxillary sinuses and sphenoid
sinus,
consistent with mucosal sinus disease.
2. No evidence of soft tissue infection or osseous erosion.
.
CXR [**2175-9-8**]
Cardiac size is normal. Bibasilar opacity is new on the left,
could be
atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be totally
excluded. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Right
central catheters remain in place.
.
CXR [**2175-9-10**]
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Aside from minimal
atelectasis in the right base, the lungs are clear. Opacity in
the left lower lobe is no longer visualized. There is no
evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
Moderate degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine. Two
right central catheters remain in place.
.
[**9-11**] SKIN BIOPSY PATHOLOGY REPORT:
Superficial dermal hemorrhage associated with small vessel
thrombi and superficial to mid dermal perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrate (see microscopic description and comment).
No herpes virus identified (routine and immunostains).
Microscopic description. Sections show intact epidermis with
occasional dyskeratotic cells. No vesiculation is identified in
the multiple tissue levels examined. There is an area of red
blood cell extravasation in the superficial dermis which is
associated with thrombi in small  vessels. No vasculitis is
seen. In addition, there is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**] superficial to mid
dermal perivascular and predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate,
with some admixed histiocytes. No herpes virus cytopathic effect
is seen on routine stains. No immunoreactivity for herpes
simplex or varicella zoster is seen on specific immunostains. No
bacterial or fungal organisms are identified on Gram or GMS
stains, respectively.
Comment.  No infectious agents are identified in this sample on
routine or infectious stains, and specifically, no herpes viral
cytopathic effect is seen. If there is continuing clinical
concern for herpes virus, culture may prove more sensitive than
tissue based stains. The combined findings of apparently
localized superficial dermal hemorrhage, small vessel thrombi
and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration are unusual and
are not specifically diagnostic in this biopsy. The histologic
differential diagnosis includes trauma, an adjacent lesion or
excoriation, a hypersensitivity reaction, and possibly an
occlusive vasculopathy. Clinical correlation is necessary
