History of Present Illness:
80 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p MI with stents in [**2164**], Htn, HL and
recent bout of pneumonia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH where
she was found to have a leukocytosis of 137K with 88%
lymphocytes. She had been in USOH after discharge on [**3-1**] from
recent admission for pneumonia at [**Hospital **] hospital, where she had
been treated with antibiotics and steroids. For the past [**1-20**]
days, she has been experiencing dizziness, lightheadedness,
nausea, cough, and diarrhea. She saw her PCP earlier today, who
found her to have orthostatic hypotension, and checked labs
revealing leukocytosis to 113K with 84% lymphocytes and many
atypical lymphs. She was referred to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where
repeat labs showed WBC of 137K, with 88% lymphocytes and
moderate smudge cells. Labs at [**Hospital1 **] were also notable for
BUN/creat of 30/1.2.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital from [**2-24**] for pneumonia, and was discharged on antibiotics (completed
course on [**3-5**]) and prednisone (last dose of 30 mg taken on
[**3-7**]).
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 97.3, 82, 128/66, 18, 98%RA.
Exam was notable for irregularly irregular heart rhythm. Labs
revealed leukocytosis of 96.3K with 88% lymphocytes and no
bands. Hct and Plts were normal. LDH was 332, and uric acid 7.8.
Lactate was 2.4. Troponin was negative. ECG showed atrial
fibrillation at ~80 bpm, LAD, TWI in I, aVL, V4-V6, and Q waves
in V1-V2. Patient was given 1L IVF, in addition to another liter
given at the OSH. She was also given ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for possible infiltrate (vs. resolving PNA) on CXR.

.
While on the floor this morning, the team noted that she was
hypotensive to 90s/60s and she was started on vancomycin and
cefepime for coverage of possible HCAP. Heme/onc also saw the
patient and reviewed her blood smear and saw that she had smudge
cells consistent with CLL but also some immature lymphocytes.
This in conjunction with a rapid rise in her WBC count over the
past year made cause for concern that she might have an immature
clone, and her blood was sent for flow cytometry.
.
This evening, the patient subsequently developed an extremely
rapid heart rate of 130s-140s while continuing to drop her
pressures, which nadired at 78 systolic on the floor and spiked
a temperature of 101.1. She also developed some respiratory
distress and wheezing and was given a duoneb. The patient
continued to mentate throughout, and complained of dizziness and
lightheadedness whenever she moved. She reported some mild
shortness of breath but no chest pain. She was bolused 1L on the
floor without improvement of her blood pressures and was
transferred to the ICU for further management.

DISCHARGE LABS:
................................................................
MICROBIOLOGY:
**All blood, urine, and sputum cultures negative**
................................................................
IMAGING:
................................................................
PATHOLOGY:
[**2171-3-8**] CXR: Right middle lobe opacity may represent atelectasis
or pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion.
.
[**2171-3-10**] B/l LE LENI: No DVT of the bilateral lower extremity.
.
[**2171-3-11**] TTE: The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed. There is a moderate
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with normal free wall contractility. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is
not well seen. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion
of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate LVH, small, hyperdynamic left ventricle
with consequent development of an LVOT gradient as the mitral
valve, chordae and papillary muscle contact the interventricular
septum during systole. The severity of the obstruction cannot be
determined but is probably moderate to severe. Diastolic
dysfunction probably present. The RV is not well seen but is
probably normal in size and function. There is calcific aortic
stenosis, again the severity cannot be determined on the basis
of this echo. There is at least mild mitral regurgitation.
.
[**2171-3-12**] TTE: Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Compared with the
prior study of [**2171-3-11**], left ventricular systolic function is
less dynamic and a resting LVOT gradient is no longer seen. The
heart rate is much slower and the severity of mitral
regurgitation has increased. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now identified.
.
[**2171-3-18**] TTE: The aortic valve is thickened. Severe aortic valve
stenosis is suggested with a peak velocity of 4m/s (64 mmHg).
.
[**2171-3-18**] Renal U/S: No hydronephrosis and no sto
