History of Present Illness:
66 year-old woman with history of asthma, COPD, DM,
hypothyroidism, with recent history significant for worsening
dyspnea over past three months, status post four courses of
antibiotics and steroids for presumed COPD exacerbation,
presenting to [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital on [**2111-6-3**] with acute
worsening dyspnea, intubated for respiratory distress, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  As noted above,
she has a history of worsening dyspnea over the past few months
that has been treated with antibiotics and steroids.  She
presented to OSH on [**2111-6-3**] with worsening dyspnea and had a
fever to 103F, and was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin
([**Date range (1) 83455**]) for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.  She developed
an increasing oxygen requirement, however, and initially
required nasal canula (94% on 1 L O2) but later required face
mask (86% on 15 L on [**6-7**]).  Her CXR, which initially was read
as negative for infiltrate, progressively worsening, with
increasingly prominent diffuse bilateral infiltrates, right
greater than left.  She also had a negative chest CTA.  With an
oxygen requirement that was rising and worsening dyspnea, she
was transitioned to vanc/zosyn/levo and then vanc/zosyn/ceftaz
([**Date range (1) 83456**]; ceftaz started [**6-8**]; levo on [**4-21**]) because of
an allergy to levofloxacin.  It is unclear why she received
double coverage for gram negatives.  She was also given
methylprednisolone ([**6-6**] dose 20 mg iv q8; then 80->60 mg iv q8
afterward).
.
On [**6-7**], she was admitted to the ICU and intubated electively
for hypoxia and SOB.  Sputum culture grew staph aureas that was
MRSA per report.  Influenza viral screen was negative.
Phenylephrine was started because of hypotension to SBPs in the
80s after being intubated and starting on propofol ([**Date range (1) 83456**]),
which had to be uptitrated for sedation.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-9**] based on her family's wishes.
.
On arrival, her ventilator settings were Vt 500cc, FiO2 100%,
PEEP 16.  She was on phenylephrine at 0.6 and rapidly weaned
off.  Her VS were 98.6 56 18 96%vent

[**2111-6-8**] BAL Flow Cytometry: There is an immuonphenotypically
abnormal CD138+/CD56+ cell population that most likely
represents the highly atypical plasmacytoid immunoblasts seen on

submitted bronchioalveolar lavage fluid. The significance of
this finding in the context of an acute viral illness is
unclear. Although a reactive process is favored, a
lymphoproliferative disorder can not be ruled out.  Repeat
sampling for cell block preparation and immunohistochemical
studies is recommended if clinically indicated.
