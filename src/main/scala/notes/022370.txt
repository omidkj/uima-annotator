Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 48 year old female recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] after prolonged hospitalization (early [**Month (only) 462**] until the
end of [**Month (only) 359**]) for chronic interstitial lung disease
complicated by pneumonia, hemoptysis, hypotension, atrial
fibrillation.  During that hospitalization the patient underwent
a bronchoscopy x2, BAL was PCP  negative, but grew out highly
resistant Klebsiella.  Cytology was initially negative for
malignancy, second sample showed atypical cells, likely
reactive.  The pt also had extensive w/u with [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA,
Anti-Gbm, mycoplasm, Legionella, and influenza labs- all of
which were negative.  Most recent CT scan of the chest showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism in the main pulmonary artery,
right pulmonary artery, and left pulmonary artery.  There was
slight improvement of the left apex and anterior aspect of the
right and left lower lobes in terms of ground-glass opacities,
but worsening/progression of opacities at the bases, extensive
mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy was unchanged.  The patient
was eventually trached on [**11-5**] and successfully weaned to trach
mask.  She was treated with two courses of Vanc and Meropenem, 8
days and 14 days respectively.  She was discharged to rehab
after being successfully weaned to a trach mask.
.
She returned to the ED this evening after experiencing desats to
the 60's and a fever to 100.1.  In addition, she reportedly
coughed up some reddish-brown sputum.  She was treated with
combivent nebs x3 and Solumedrol at rehab.  In the ED she was
tachycardic, temp of 99.0 and tachypneic w/ RR in 30's.  Initial
ABG showed 7.38/40/45/25, likely venous sample.  The patient
received 2 liters NS, nebs, and was ordered for a dose of
Meropenem.  A CXR was done, and the patient was admitted to the
ICU.
.
On arrival to the unit, the patient was lethargic but arousable.
 She denied chest pain or abdominal pain.  Further ROS unable to
be assessed.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2129-12-9**]) The tracheostomy, left side of central line, and
feeding tube are unchanged in position. There has been interval
increase in the pulmonary vascular markings consistent with
pulmonary edema. There are more confluent opacities seen within
the bases. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within
normal limits.
.
CTA ([**2129-12-9**])
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Stable enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. There has been interval increase in the ground-glass opacity
seen bilaterally, within the lower lobes predominantly but also
within the upper lobes. These are geographic in nature, and
appear in dependent positions. Given the interval increase,
diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema, alveolar
hemorrhage, infection or aspiration, superimposed upon the
patient's known underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48 yo female with respiratory failure requiring trach
secondary to chronic interstitial lung disease complicated by
pneumonia, also with a-fib, CAD, and HTN, recently discharged to
rehab who returns to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia and fevers.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient presented after being
observed to have desturations down to the 60s at her rehab
facility. A number of etiologies were considered for her
worsening respiratory status including infection, pulmonary
edema, mucous plugging, pulmonary embolism or exacerbation of
her underlying lung disease.  CT angiogram was negative for
pulmonary embolus but showed increased ground glass opacities
bilaterally in dependent regions consistent with either
pulmonary edema, infection or aspiration.  Given her severe
underlying lung disease and the potential for exacerbation she
was started on high dose steroids which were tapered quickly.
On presentation she was taking meropenem for a resistent
klebsiella pneumonia and vancomycin was added to broaden her
antibiotic coverage. The meropenem was discontinued on hospital
day two and she completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.  It was
ultimately thought a majority of her symptoms were secondary to
volume overload and she was aggressively diuresed with lasix.
Because of her worsening respiratory status it was necessary to
reinitiate mechanical ventilation.  From her previous
hospitalization it was known that the patient tends to require
high levels of PEEP to maintain her oxygenation. Throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization her PEEP was slowly weaned with
plans to continue to wean from the ventilator at a skilled
nursing facility upon discharge.
.
# Fevers - On presentation the patient was febrile to 100.1 with
hypoxia, tachycardia, tachypnea and increased sputum production.
 She also was found to have leukocytosis with a left shift.  At
no time was she hemodynamically unstable.  It was thought that
the source of her fevers was likely due to recurrent pulmonary
infection.  Other considerations inc
