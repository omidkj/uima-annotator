Brief Hospital Course:
Spinal Metastasis:  The patient was admitted to the floor s/p
tumor embolization, decompression, and fusion procedure. He was
admitted for pain contorl and medical monitoring.  He was taken
off of bedrest and allowed to ambulate with assist.  His pain
was contorlled initially with a dilaudid PCA with morphine prn
for breakthrough pain.  This provided good relief, allthough
movement was painfull.  Physical therapy was consulted and
assisted the patient with ambulation.  He was transitioned over
to oral pain management including MS Contin 30mg TID and oral
dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
.
One active issue was a decreased hematocrit and persistant
tachycardia.  Given recent surgery, and imobility, a CTA was
ordered which was negative for PE.  He was trnasfused a total of
two units with good effect.  He has anemia at baseline, likely
secondary to chronic disease from RCC, and we were comfortbale
with a Hct of ~30.  He was discharged with a Hct of 30.6.  His
tachycardia was helped both with fluid recusitation and with
adequate pain control.  On discharge his HR was in the 80s.
.
He was ambulating slowley but effectivly on his own.  He
tolerated pain well.  He moved his bowels and tolerated po
intake.  He was discharged to follow up both with Ooncology and
with Radiation Oncology.  Specifically he had an appointment on
[**7-13**] with the radiation oncologist.
