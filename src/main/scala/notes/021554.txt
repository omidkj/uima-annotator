Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial catheter

History of Present Illness:
85 yof with hx of Afib with new diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome
p/w AMS.
.
Patient recently admitted and discharged 5 days ago.
.
The pt went to [**Country 2045**] on [**2117-2-16**]. While there she noted increasing
chest heaviness and DOE, decreased appetite, decreased energy.
She felt increasing swelling of her extremities, and weight
gain. Due to her husband's concern the pt returned to [**Location 86**].
She then went into her PCP for evaluation and was sent to the ED
for concern re: new hypervolemia.
.
Her admission from [**Date range (3) 90853**], by Problem:
# Found to have Nephrotic Syndrome likely Secondary to Focal
Segmental
Glomerulosclerosis (anasarca, pr:cr ratio 15.3, Albumin of 1.9,
LDL 225, + oval fat body casts, and Cr of 5.0 up from her prior
normal baseline of 0.9). Full evaluation below. She was started
on 60mg of prednisone (Day 1 = [**3-23**]) which she tolerated well
with only mild improvement in her renal function over the first
2 week period (5.0 -> 4.2). She was also started on Vit D and
calcium supplements and continued on her PPI for steroid
prophylaxis. Repeat Prot/Cr ratio was down to 12.

# Positive Quantiferon Gold: She was tested with quantiferon
gold prior to initiation of steroids and had a positive result
which likely represents past exposure to TB. She was without
symptoms and had a negative CXR. ID was consulted and she was
started on INH 300mg daily with pyridoxine 50mg PO daily x 9
months

# RUE Chronic Arterial Thrombus S/P Thrombectomy: Patient
triggered twice for hypotension and found to have asymmetrical
blood pressures in in her arms and partiallly occlusive thrombus
in her right axillary/brachial artery and underwent arterial
thrombectomy which was complicated by right arm hematoma. Per
the surgical report and speaking with the surgeons, the thrombus
was quite large and felt to be chronic and atherosclerotic in
nature.  Discharged on coumadin with a goal INR of [**3-19**].
.
For the last two days at [**Hospital1 1501**] they were unable to draw labs. This
am, the pt was very sleepy. At 11 am on [**2117-4-9**], she was 129/91,
98, 20, 99%, 98.7 temp. Patient's family reports that her mental
status change in the last couple of days. She really doesn't
have any specific complaints.
.

.
In the MICU

ECHO [**2117-4-9**] Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate to
large sized circumferential pericardial effusion, measuring 1.0
cm overlying the right ventricle, 0.7 cm overlying the right
ventricular apex, 1.5 cm adjacent to the left ventricular apex,
and 2.4 cm adjacent to the basal left ventricle. Adjacent to the
right ventricle, the effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. Adjacent to the
left ventricle, the effusion is echolucent, with occasional
stranding is visualized within the pericardial space c/w
organization. Though there is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, there
is no sustained right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse. There is minimal invagination of the right ventricle
during diastole. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial
effusion (largely adjacent to left >> right ventricle) without
frank echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echodense effusion
adjacent to right ventricle suggests cellular organization.
Normal biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
CXR [**2117-4-9**] New left IJ line with tip in the proximal SVC. No
visualized
pneumothorax. Potential progression of the left greater than
right opacities suggestive of effusions with underlying airspace
disease not excluded.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2117-4-9**] No acute intracranial process.
