Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, elevated INR, transfer for concern for tamponade
.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89 yo female with history of diastolic CHF, a fib on coumadin,
hypertension, TIA and CVA in [**2192**], chronic kidney disease with
baseline creatinine of 1.3 who is transferred here from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with concern for tamponade.
.
Pt presented initially [**7-28**] to [**Hospital 197**] clinic and was found to
have an INR of 7.1. She reported increasing weakness,
intermittent substernal chest pressure in certain positions and
intermittent shortness of breath so was referred to the
hospital. She denied any associated diaphoresis, no radiation,
no palpitations and stated that only exacerbating factors were
moving in certain positions. She denies any recent fevers,
cough, N/V, no diarrhea or constipation, though she does state
that she has some blood in her stool yesterday. No dysuria or
recent hematuria, no recent falls.
.
At [**Name (NI) 620**], pt was noted to have elevated creatinine to 3.4 from
baseline 1.3. She also had trop increase to 0.048. She had an
elevated BNP to 4752 (though may be her baseline) and there was
concern that she symptoms of DOE were secondary to volume
overload so she was diuresed with lasix 40 mg IV, at least once,
despite BP 87/70. She also received her home dose of clonidine.
Her CXR showed possible worse cardiomegaly. Her creatinine
continued to rise with diuresis to 3.6. Renal and cardiology
were consulted who both felt that her continued increase in
creatinine was likely secondary to over diuresis.

Yesterday evening, pt developed worsening hypotension with SBP
80s for which she received 500 cc NS bolus x 2 with increase in
SBP to 100s transiently, then decreased. With fluid boluses also
came hypoxia requiring 3L oxgyen. She was started on norepi and
a pulsus checked then was reportedly 20 mmHg.  She was started
on vanc, ceftriaxone and zosyn as well. At that time, echo was
performed by the ED staff and showed a moderate pericardial
effusion. The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for
further management. She received vitamin K and FFP prior to
transfer.
.
In the CCU, pt reports chest pain when turning, asymptomatic at
rest, breathing comfortably. She is very tired. Initially she
was confused and thought she was in a parking garage. She
eventually cleared and was able to identify [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**].

Social history is significant for the absence of current or past
tobacco use, though her deceased husband was a heavy smoker.

works for the [**Name (NI) 2318**]. She used to work in quality control. Her
husband passed away 15 years ago.

Head CT:FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or infarction.  Prominent ventricles and sulci
suggest age-related atrophy.  Periventricular white matter
hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.  There is a small hypodensity in the left occipital
lobe consistent with encephalomalacia from an old infarct.  It
is stable from previous exam.  The basal cisterns appear patent
and there is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
No fracture is identified.  There is fluid in the left sphenoid
sinus.  The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air
cells and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are
unremarkable.
CONCLUSION:
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
C-Spine:
FINDINGS:  There is anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and
retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 with extensive degenerative changes
at both levels.  There is fusion of the left facet joint at
C3-4. These findings suggest that the subluxations are due to
degenerative disk disease. There is mild canal narrowing at C5.
There is no evidence of a fracture.  CT is not able to provide
intrathecal detail comparable to MRI, but visualized outline of
the thecal sac appears unremarkable.  No lymphadenopathy is
present by CT size criteria.  Vascular calcifications are noted
at the aortic arch and in the carotid bifurcations bilaterally.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left than
right.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of fracture. Subluxation involving C4 appears
chronic. No
other alignment abnormalities detected.
2.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusions.

TTE: [**2197-8-7**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion
which is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements [**Last Name (un) **] stranding c/w organization. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade or constriction.
.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion c/w organiziation/blood-inflammation as described
above.
