Brief Hospital Course:
# BRBPR: Upon admission, she was hemodynamically stable with no
evidence of tachycardia or hypotension with hct within baseline.
Etiology was initially suspected to be a lower GI source,
especially given her history of bleeding hemorrhoids and known
diverticuli.  She was on Plavix and ASA on admission for an
intra-vertebral artery stent placed in [**8-31**]. Initial treament
included placing 2 large bore PIVs and hemodynamic monitoring.
She was transfused 3u PRBC total for a falling Hct.  On [**2186-1-24**],
she was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.  Given
active bleeding, Plavix and ASA were held and Neurology was
consulted.  Neurology confirmed that she could remain off of the
Plavix indefinitely, but that she should restart ASA when
hemodynamically stable.  Per GI consult, she had a colonoscopy
on [**2186-1-25**] which revealed continued bleeding to the ileum without
an obvious lesion.  Thus an EGD was performed on [**2186-1-26**] which
did not reveal an upper GI source of bleeding.  A dudenal polyp
was found and was sent for biopsy.  She was restarted on diovan.
 On discharge, her hct remained stable.  She was continued on
ASA.
.
# s/p CVA: She is s/p CVA in [**8-31**] s/p intra-arterial TPA with
stent placed in R vertebral artery. She has residual R eyelid
ptosis and double vision with no new or worsened deficits.
Neurology was consulted on admission given need to hold
anti-platelt therapy.  They confirmed that Plavix could be
discontinued given the nature of her stent, but that aspirin
should be restarted once she was hemodynamically stable.  She
was restarted on ASA on discharge.
.
# HTN: Her outpt regimen of Diovan was restarted on discharge.
.
# Asthma: She was continued outpatient albuterol and advair.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: She was continued on her outpatient regimen of
atorvastatin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a low blood count.  You had a colonoscopy
and an EGD which showed that you had bleeding in your
gastrointestinal tract most likely from a diverticulosis.  You
also had multiple transfusions for this low blood count and your
blood count remained stable in the last 24 hours.  In addition,
your bloody stool resolved on discharge.

Please note that your plavix was discontinued.  Please do not
take this medication any longer.  We have also restarted your
aspirin along with your other medications.  Please continue to
take your aspirin daily given your recent stroke and stent.  You
may discontinue your aspirin only at the discretion of your
doctor.

If you have any other symptoms, please call the emergency room
