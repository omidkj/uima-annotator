Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for chest pain that was found to be
a PE on CT Angiogram in the ED.  Patient was hemodynamically
stable overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], though required morphine for pain
control.  She requires a coagulation workup as an outpatient and
will require 6 month- 1 year anticoagulation once discharged.

On the floor, pt. remained hemodynamically stable.  Her INR
remained low, so warfarin was titrated up.  On HD 5, her INR was
still 1.2, and she was asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable, and
with normal room air saturations - she was converted to
enoxaparin injections and outpatient follow up was arranged for
continued monitoring and titration of her warfarin through her
primary care doctor's office.

Case and plan including need for hypercoagulable workup was
discharge, and follow up was arranged for within 48 hours of
discharge.
