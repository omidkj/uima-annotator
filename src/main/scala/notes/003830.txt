Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Diagnostic paracentesis [**2121-12-1**]
2. Hemodialysis M/W/F during this admission
3. Cardiac catheterization [**2121-12-5**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 year old female with a history of ESLD [**12-23**] HCV
complicated by HRS and SBP in past, HTN, DM who presents with
one day of worsening mental status.  Per husband patient was in
usual state of health one day prior to admit.  Over course of
day her mental status decreased until she was answering one word
answers.  She has not been oriented to person, place or time and
has been having increasing agitation over the past 24 hours.
Per husband who spoke to renal fellow, no N/V/C/D, no F/C.  Last
HD was on Friday.  Of note patient recently admitted and D/Ced
for AMS, at that time no etiology could be found but patient
improved with lactulose.  Durring last admit patient started on
cefpodoxime for SBP proph.

In the ED initial vitals were: 98.0 78 117/101 20 100 on RA.
Labs were significant for a UA which appeared infected.  A CT
head was done, the prelim read was no acute process.  The
patient was given 2mg of ativan for agitation after which she
became minimally responsive. A diagnostic para was performed
which was negative for SBP, Cx pending.

On the floor, patient was somnolent and was not able to answer
questions.

Studies:

[**2121-12-1**] ECG - Sinus rhythm. Borderline Q-T interval
prolongation. Since the previous tracing of [**2121-11-22**] probably no
signifiant change.

[**2121-12-1**] CXR (port AP) - Low lung volumes, but no focal
consolidations.

[**2121-12-1**] NCHCT - Suboptimal exam due to patient motion. No
acute intracranial pathology seen.

[**2121-12-1**] CXR (port AP) - No pneumothorax is identified.
Allowing for low lung volumes, no definite lung infiltrate is
seen.

[**2121-12-2**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. The right ventricular cavity is borderline dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets are elongated. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Mild resting outflow tract [**Year (4 digits) **]. Minimal aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-7-2**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased while the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased. Right
ventricular size is smaller. Estimated pulmonary artery
pressures are higher. The heart rate is faster.

[**2121-12-2**] ECG - Normal sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-12-1**] there
is no diagnostic interim change.

[**2121-12-2**] RUQ U/S
1. Patent portal vein and hepatic veins.
2. The portal vein has normal hepatopetal flow; however, the
splenic vein demonstrates a hepatofugal flow. This appearance
suggest underlying spontaneous porto-systemic shunt, most likely
splenorenal.
3. Unchanged cholelithiasis with no signs of cholecystitis.
4. Findings compatible with cirrhosis. Increasing ascites.

[**2121-12-4**] CXR (port AP) - low lung volumes which is unchanged.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. A right central venous
catheter ends in the right atrium, unchanged from the previous
study. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
contours are unchanged.
