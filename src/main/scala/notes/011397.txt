Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
chronic abdominal pain and recurrent pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Staging laparoscopy.
2. Pylorus-preserving Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy.
3. Open cholecystectomy.
4. Open liver biopsy.


History of Present Illness:
This 51-year-old gentleman
presented to me within the last month with a 9-year history
of abdominal pain and recurrent bouts of pancreatitis. His
workup for this never took him to the extent of advanced
imaging nor an ERCP until recently. He was referred to Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an endoscopic ultrasound and that
examination showed gross cystic disease of the head of the
pancreas. A CT scan confirmed this with macroscopic cystic
disease in the head, inflammatory changes of the whole
pancreas and a dilated pancreatic duct distally as well with
lymphadenopathy. All these features put together were very
suggestive of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor.


Past Medical History:
pancreatic cystic dz., pancreatitis, GERD, multiple fractures,
cataracts. Sz associated with alcohol withdrawal.
PSH: rotator cuff rep air, R knee arthroscopy, EUS


Social History:
heavy ETOH abuse, smoking

Physical Exam:
NAD AOx3

DIAGNOSIS

1.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (A-B):

Chronic cholecystic.

Cholelithiasis, pigment-type.

One lymph node (0/1), no malignancy identified.

2.  Liver, wedge biopsy (C):

Prominent steatosis; micro- and macrovesicular, no intracellular
hyaline.



Portal fibrosis with periportal extension.  No cirrhosis
identified (trichrome stain).



Marked increase in iron deposition (3+/4+, chiefly in
hepatocytes with accentuation of deposition in acinar zone 1).



The findings are consistent with toxic/metabolic syndrome.  The
amount and distribution of iron deposition raises the
possibility of a genetic iron storage disease.

3.  Pancreatic neck margin (D):

Chronic pancreatitis with marked fibrosis and no malignancy
identified.

4.  Pancreas and duodenum, Whipple resection (E-X, AB-AH):

Chronic pancreatitis with severe fibrosis and multiple dilated
pancreatic ducts.  The ductal linings show inflammation and
focal erosions, as well as reactive epithelial changes.  No
neoplasia is identified.



Nine lymph nodes with no malignancy identified.

5.  "Pancreatic body, final margin" (Y-AA):

Chronic pancreatitis with no malignancy identified.



One lymph node with no malignancy identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the OR for a pylorus preserving Whipple
procedure and diagnostic laparoscopy which went well. Patient
was kept intubated and brought to the ICU in anticipation of
acute alcohol withdrawal. Patient was thus kept intubated and
sedated for a week and treated with benzodiazepines for alcohol
withdrawal. He was slowly weaned and was successfully extubated
on POD7. He continued to do well. Patient developed
post-operative fever. Sputum cultures ([**2124-3-5**]) grew out
MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS, STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE and HAEMOPHILUS
INFLUENZAE and was thought to be ventilator associated
pneumonia. He was started on antibiotics. Patient's respiratory
symptoms resolved and he continued to do well. He was
transferred to the floor.  His diet was advanced without
complication.
Throughout his stay, the benefits and importance of abstinence
from alcohol were continually stressed by multiple members of
the team, including residents, case and social workers, and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  It was our hope that Mr. [**Known lastname 12262**] would go to an alcohol
rehab facility after the surgery to help him recover and
continue to stay alcohol free.  He adamantly insisted that he
needed to go home first to take care of personal matters. He was
given strict instructions for follow up and instructions for
admission to rehab facilities. It is hoped that Mr. [**Known lastname 12262**] will
continue to stay abstinent from alcohol and will seek assistance
dealing with his alcohol abuse.
He was discharged home on [**2124-3-15**] in good condition.
