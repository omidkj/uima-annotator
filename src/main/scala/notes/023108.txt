Admission Date:  [**2174-1-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2174-2-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2111-9-4**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
male who had developed some shortness of breath and dyspnea
on exertion over the past week to months prior to admission
who went into cardiac arrest.  He was found to be in
ventricular tachycardia in the field by Emergency Medical
Service.  He had shocks times three and 1 mg of epinephrine.
En route to outside hospital, the patient went into
ventricular fibrillation and had additional shocks time three
as well as epinephrine.  The patient went into ventricular
tachycardia.

The patient was brought to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital Emergency
Department.  An arterial blood gas at that time showed
7.11/31/66 with multiple rhythms on telemetry and
electrocardiogram including ventricular tachycardia,
ventricular fibrillation, sinus tachycardia with variable
atrioventricular conduction.  The patient received
procainamide 900 intravenously and was shocked multiple
times.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] where a temporary wire was placed at the right
internal jugular.

The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory.  The
patient had a total of greater than 20 shocks.  Pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 45, right atrial pressure was
40, and there was a 30% occlusion of the left main coronary
artery, a 50% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending
artery, and a total occlusion of the left circumflex, and
total occlusion of the right carotid artery.

The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2170**] with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery and radial to the obtuse marginal.  The
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery was patent, and the radial to the obtuse marginal was
patent.  There was a 70% left subclavian stenosis and a 70%
to 80% first obtuse marginal stenosis.  Arterial and
ventricular temporary pacing wires were placed.  The patient
was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump.  The patient
arrived to the floor with intravenous amiodarone and
nitroglycerin drips.

On the floor, the patient became hypotensive.  Nitroglycerin
was stopped.  Pulmonary artery diastolics were 18.  Numbers
revealed a cardiac index of 1.4 with the intra-aortic balloon
pump in place.  The patient was started on fluids.
Dobutamine was started.

A STAT bedside echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of
20% and an old inferior scar.  No valvular abnormalities.

The patient was seen by the Electrophysiology Service who
changed him from ventricular pacing to atrial pacing and
ventricularly sensed.  His blood pressure dramatically
improved with this change.  The patient was observed in the
Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post 2-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2170**].
2.  Peripheral vascular disease.
3.  Aortic aneurysm repair in [**2171**].
4.  Status post aortobifemoral in [**2171**].
5.  Status post left carotid endarterectomy.
6.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his brother and is
fully functional at baseline.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:
The patient had patent grafts and diffuse disease.  He was
continued on aspirin and Lipitor.  His beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor were added back and titrated to maximal effect as
tolerated by the patient's blood pressure.

(b)  Pump:  An initial showed an ejection fraction of 20%,
old inferior wall hypokinesis, and akinesis.  Initially, the
patient's cardiac index was noted to be 1.4 while on the
intra-aortic balloon pump.  The index went up to 2.1 with
dobutamine and atrioventricular pacing.

A repeat echocardiogram performed on [**2174-2-2**] showed
left ventricular cavity moderately dilated, overall left
ventricular function systolic function was severely
depressed, with an ejection fraction of 30%.  Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities including basilar inferior
akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis, mild
anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis, and mid to distal anterior
hypokinesis.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion were normal.  The aortic valve leaflets were normal.
The mitral valve was mildly thickened.  There was trivial
mitral regurgitation was seen.  The left ventricular systolic
function was improved from the initial echocardiogram on
[**2174-1-28**].

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient is status post ventricular
fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia prolonged arrest
with prolonged resuscitation efforts, likely from old scar
formation.  The patient had improved acidemia and was
followed by the Electrophysiology Service throughout his
hospital course.

On [**1-29**], the patient had one episode of ventricular
tachycardia.  He was shocked with resolution and was placed
on amiodarone.

On [**2-1**], the patient went for electrophysiology
mapping.  They were unable to induce ventricular tachycardia
at that time.

The patient went for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
placement on [**2-3**] with no complications.

The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone was checked as he
was started on amiodarone.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone was
notable at 38.  The patient should have this followed by his
primary care physician as an outpatient considering
amiodarone use.

His aspartate aminotransferase was 91.  His
alanine-aminotransferase was 58.  The patient had pulmonary
function tests performed prior to discharge for a baseline
pulmonary status on amiodarone.  Forced vital capacity was
1.64 (41% of predicted), FEV1 was 1.34 (48% of predicted),
and FEV1: FVC ratio was 82 (115% of predicted).

2.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient has a history of diabetes.
He had high fingerstick blood glucose levels with ketones.
The patient was initially placed on an insulin drip which was
weaned off, and he was transitioned back to his regular
diabetes medications and insulin sliding-scale.

3.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was extubated on [**1-31**] without complications.

4.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was initially noted to be in
acute renal failure with creatinine levels as high as 2.3 on
[**2174-1-29**].  Over the course of his hospital stay, the
patient's creatinine trended down to his baseline of 1.6
prior to discharge.
