Imaging:
FINDINGS: A small right pleural effusion is seen which has
decreased in size since the prior study. Patchy opacities at the
right lung base are likely atelectasis, although infection
cannot be excluded. Linear density near the left lung base is
likely atelectasis. No other areas of focal consolidation are
noted. There is no pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is difficult to assess due to severe scoliosis;
however, cardiomegaly is stable and the mediastinal silhouette
is unchanged. There is calcification of the aorta. Visualized
osseous structures appear intact.

IMPRESSION: Decrease in size of small right pleural effusion.
Most likely
atelectasis in the right lower lobe, although infection cannot
be excluded. Stable cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of COPD on home O2, Diastolic CHF who
presents with sob and hypoxia likely due to copd exacerbation
unable to wean from bipap.
The big picture is that she has multifactorial severe resp
failure including:

- Severe COPD
- Chronic diastolic heart failure, PH from that as well as cor
pulmonale, afib
- Restrictive ventilatory defect from severe kyphoscoliosis,
large hiatal hernia, pleural effusions, which also contributes
to atelectasis

She has not had a robust response to medical therapy. I am
concerned that though she is critically ill with high oxygen
requirement, this is probably her baseline and she may not
improve to the point of requiring less supplemental O2.

.
# Hypoxia:  likely secondary to COPD exaccerbation with or
without an underlying pneumonia.  Treated for COPD exaccerbation
with steroids and azithromycin.  Also started on ceftriaxone for
? CAP and vanco for ? HAP considering she was a nursing home
resident.  The first two days of her hospitalization she
required intermittent bipap treatment to maintain O2 sats with
goal btw 88-92.  Then she started to maintain good O2
saturations in the above mentioned goal on 60% face mask, which
is the amount of oxygen she was wearing in rehab before
readmission.  She was mentating well and not complaining of SOB
with this mask.  She was switched to levofloxacin after the
first doses of antibiotics mentioned above, and treated with a
course of this which was stopped on [**12-29**].  She completed a course
of azithromycin.  Initially for steroids she was on IV 125 mg
solumedrol, then switched to 40 mg IV bid dosing and then
transitioned to PO 40 steroids.  And we recommend 3 more days of
prednisone 40 mg daily, then 2 days of 20 mg daily, then 2 days
of 10 mg daily, then 2 days of 5 mg daily, then stopping.
.
# Diastolic Heart Failure:  continued toprol at home dose
initially.  Diuresed over the course of her hospitalization and
then started to appear clinically dry and develop a contraction
alkalosis.  We are continuing to hold her lasix and
acetazolamide.  It should be restarted based on her clinical
fluid status and resolution of her alkalosis.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: was rate controlled and anticoagulated
with coumadin.  Went into afib with RVR during hospitalization
on [**12-27**].  Control with PO and IV metoprolol failed and Dilt gtt
was started.  She was weaned off the diltiazem gtt on [**12-29**] and
transitioned to PO diltiazem of 30 mg qid.  Her dose was
increased to 60 mg qid with good control and rates in the
80s-90s.  We did not restart her metoprolol.  It could be
restarted as needed for rate control.
.
# ARF: had increase in her creatinine to 1.4, likey due to
dehydration from over diuresis.  With holding of her diuretics,
it returned to her baseline around 1.0 or 0.9.  She made
appropriate urine throughout her hospitalization.
