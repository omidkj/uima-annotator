Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
Ureteral stricture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**9-15**] Exploratory laparotomy with intraoperative ultrasound of
transplanted kidney and ureteropyelostomy of left ureter to
transplanted kidney
[**10-8**] Kidney Needle Bx


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 year old Hispanic male with end-stage renal
disease who underwent a transplant several months ago that has
been complicated by a
persistent ureteral stricture. Despite multiple attempts at
dilation, this has been unsalvageable and recently access across
the stricture was lost during manipulation. He presents for
definitive repair.

[**9-16**] Renal US - New blunting of the arterial waveforms without
diastolic flow demonstrated. Persistently elevated resistive
indices ranging from 0.87 to 0.91 (previously 0.86 to 1.0). 2.
Moderate hydronephrosis, probably mildly increased in the
interval, with questionable residual echogenic clot in the
collecting system.

[**9-17**] Nephrostomy Catheter Drainage exam - Patency of
ureteroureteral anastomotic site demonstrated, with free passage
of contrast and no leakage. 2. Exchange of existing nephrostomy
for a nephroureterostomy tube (40 cm 8-French biliary tube )

[**9-17**] ECHO - LVEF >55%

[**9-21**] Renal US - Persistent moderate hydronephrosis with some
debris in the collecting system. We question whether the
drainage catheter is functioning. 2. Minimal diastolic arterial
flow to the transplant, with resistive indices near 1.0

[**9-24**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] without Contrast - No recent infarct is identified.

[**10-3**] Renal US - Persistent moderate hydronephrosis with clot
again visualized within the collecting system. 2. Minimal
diastolic arterial flow to the transplant, unchanged from
[**2150-9-21**].

11/12,18,25 CT Head - No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage. Please note that MRI with diffusion weighting is
more sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia.

[**10-6**] CT Abd - There is a transplanted kidney within the right
lower quadrant. This appears to be enlarged in size, and there
is marked hydronephrosis, with a small amount of high density
material within the lumen of the renal pelvis, consistent with
focal hemorrhage. This is likely not new in comparison to recent
renal ultrasounds. Additionally, there is adjacent inflammatory
stranding, with a focal confluence which contains several foci
of gas, consistent with early, nonorganized, inflammatory
change. There is associated compression of the distal right
native ureter, with right hydroureter and hydronephrosis of the
right native kidney. 2. Cholelithiasis. 3. There is mild
thickening of the descending colon and of the rectum. These
loops are not fluid filled, and these may represent early
colitis - clinical correlation is recommended.

[**10-8**] Kidney Needle Bx - There is no evidence of acute cellular
rejection in this sample.  There is no evidence of fungal
involvement (neutrophilic infiltrate/granulomas).  The findings
are consistent with chronic allograft nephropathy.  No overt
diabetic changes are seen

[**10-4**] EEG - Abnormal EEG due to an overall generally low voltage
record
with marked slowing, somewhat accentuated over the right
hemisphere at
times. This would indicate a diffuse mild to moderate
encephalopathy
with the possibility of intermittent vascular insufficiency
involving
rightsided structures. No discharging features were seen

[**10-12**] Nephrostomy catheter drainage - No evidence of transplant
kidney hydronephrosis or ureteric stenosis. Free flow of
contrast was seen from the renal transplant collecting system to
the bladder. A collection of contrast is seen just inferior to
the renal transplant kidney.
Although this may be related to the right ureteric remnant, a
contrast leak cannot be entirely excluded. Note that a leakage
site was not definitely identified

[**10-21**] R Upper Ext US - No DVT
