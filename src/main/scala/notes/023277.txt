male with longstanding, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, requiring home oxygen and with a recent exacerbation
in [**2180-2-19**] requiring [**Hospital6 2018**]-Medicine Intensive Care Unit admission, intubation and
antibiotics who presents two days after discharge to
rehabilitation, with shortness of breath.  The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] on [**2180-3-2**] with shortness of breath requiring intubation and a
Medicine Intensive Care Unit stay, with a course complicated
by a non-Q wave myocardial infarction.  The patient was
treated for ................. pneumonia and discharged to

then discharged to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34620**] House on [**2180-3-24**].  The
patient was discharged from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on a
medicine regimen that differed from his previously which had
included chronic Prednisone 20 mg q.d.  The patient at this
time of discharge from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation was not on any
chronic Prednisone dosage.  Over the next two days, the
patient noted that he had increased shortness of breath, a
productive cough with sputum change to a yellow color,
increased watery eyes, and increased nasal discharge.  On the
morning of [**2180-3-26**], the patient noted that he was in
extreme shortness of breath and "couldn't do this anymore."
The patient called 9-1-1 and was taken to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department.  The
patient denies recent fevers, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, change in stools, diarrhea, constipation,
dysuria, or joint pain.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has a questionable allergy to Bactrim

motion hypokinesis, normal left and right atria, left
ventricular wall thickness but no wall motion abnormalities.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's physical examination
upon presentation included vital signs of 95.8, heartrate
104, blood pressure 164/136, respiratory rate 40, oxygen
saturation 98% on nonrebreather.
Constitutional-severe respiratory distress, alert,
cooperative.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat-Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light, extraocular movements intact.
Neck-Positive use of accessory respiratory muscles.
Chest-Poor air entry bilaterally, no wheezes noted.
Cardiovascular-Tachycardiac, regular rhythm, S1 and S2
present.
Genitourinary-No costovertebral angle tenderness bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal-Bowel sounds present, soft, nontender,
nondistended belly.
Skin-No rashes, capillary refill less than 2 seconds.
Neurologic-Cranial nerves II through XII intact, strength and

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data included a white
blood cell count of 8.7, hematocrit 37.4, platelets 297, MCV
73, differential for white blood cell count 47.7 polys, 33.1
lymphocytes, 12.1 monocytes, 6.5 eosinophils, 0.6 basophils.
The patient's arterial blood gases included PH 7.18, pCO2
109, pO2 92.  The patient's bicarbonate at the time was 34.
Chest x-ray was notable for emphysema, no evidence of
pneumonia or heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient
was noted to be in extreme shortness of breath with accessory
respiratory muscle use, inability to speak a full sentence,
occasional hypertension to the 190s/120s and arterial blood
gas of 7.18, 109, 92.  The patient refused intubation.  The
patient was given multiple Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers
and started on intravenous steroids.  The patient's shortness
of breath improved with the nebulizers and his blood pressure
normalized.  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit.

Upon arrival in the Medicine Intensive Care Unit, the patient
was started on biPAP and an empiric course of Levofloxacin
for presumed respiratory infection.  The patient ruled out
for an myocardial infarction.  The patient was able to be
weaned off of biPAP and onto oxygen nasal cannula on the
morning of hospital day #2.  As the patient had minimal
shortness of breath and required nebulizers only every 4
hours he was deemed in condition for floor transfer.  The
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital 139**] Medical Service.

Over the next four days, the patient was given a two day
course of high dose Methylprednisolone and then restarted on
Prednisone 40 mg q.d.  The patient was also weaned off of 4
liters nasal cannula oxygen to oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula
which is the patient's home dose.  The patient's respiratory
status returned to baseline within the next few days of
hospitalization.

Occupational therapy was consulted to visit the patient.
Occupational therapy noted the patient had decreased
mobility, decreased cognition of safety and general
deconditioning.  They recommended either longterm placement
or increased services in his current home.  Physical therapy
saw the patient and noted he had impaired gait and locomotion
when ambulating.  They worked with him for two days at the
hospitalization at the end of which he was at his baseline.
Physical therapy recommended either longterm placement or
increased services at his current location.  Due to concerns
over the patient's ability to take his home medicine regimen,
Neuropsychiatry was consulted.  Upon their te
