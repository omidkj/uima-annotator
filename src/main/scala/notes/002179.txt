Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2499**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough and Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
70 yo female with a hx of small cell lung CA s/p RUL resection
recently started on taxotere, COPD, bronchitis admitted for
cough and hypoxia in clinic. Pt began experiencing cough and
sputum production on [**9-7**] although d/c summary from previous
hospitalization reported 2-3wk hx of weakness and SOB. Pt
reported cough intially productive of green sputum. She denied
any fever or chills, recent sick contacts. Pt went to clinic 1
and appeared tachypneic and was sent to the ED. Pt was admitted
initially for brochitis vs PNA and started on MDI's and
levofloxacin. Chest CT revealed no infiltrate suggestive of PNA
and she was easily weaned off of oxygen overnight so antibiotics
were stopped. Interventional pulmonary team was consulted since
the mass impinging on the rt main stem bronchus appeared larger,
but no intervention made since it was lesss that 80% obstructed
and unlikely the cause of hypoxia. Pt was dischaged on [**9-9**]
without antibiotics and off of o2. Pt continued to be short of
breath at home and continued cough productive of brown sputum.
No fevers or chills were present, but reported diarrhea prior to
and throughout her hospitalization w/o melena or hematochezia.
Pt denied PND, but had orthopnea and reported new LE edema,
although pt has no hx of CHF and echo from [**9-18**] was normal. Pt
presented to clinic on [**9-11**] for taxotere tx but med was held
due to poor PO intake, diarrhea, and weakness and instead was
given 1L IVF. She came back to clinic for 2U PRBC transfusion
for low Hct and found to have temp to 100.2 O2 Sats of 90% [**Female First Name (un) **]
which only improved to 94% on 2 L so she was given 125mg of
solumedrol for COPD flare vs PNA.


Past Medical History:
1. SCLCA (stage IIIA) hx-found to have lung mass on CXR after
syncopal episode in [**2-17**], trqnsbronchial bx revealed SCLCA and
she started taxol/carboplatin induction with rad tx in [**3-18**]
followed by gemcitibine with RUL resection in [**7-20**]. CA found to
recur in [**6-19**] and pt started on Iressa. Mass not responding well
to Iressa so she was changed to toxotere on [**8-28**]
2. hypothyroidism
3. TAH
4. ?RML stenting
5. COPD/Bronchitis
6. T4 compression fx and chronic back pain

Brief Hospital Course:
1. PNA-CXR on admission showed RLL PNA and she continued to have
productive cough and wheeze with elevated WBC. WBC thought to be
falsely elevated due to steroid use. All culture data except for
initial sputum cx was negative. Initial sputum gram stain with
GPC in pairs suggestive of staph or strep and culture showing
oral flora with sparse Pseudomonas. Pt initially on
Ceftazadime/azithromycin/flagyl then weaned to Levoflox/flagy
for partial pseudomonas coverage on, and postobstructive PNA and
completed 14 day regimen although flagyl dced on day 5 for
possiblity of lowering the seizure threshold and clindamycin
added on day #8. Pt wheeze continued on PE although she has a hx
of obstructive pulmonary disease so was treated with stress dose
IV solumedrol 60mg intially which was titrated up to 6mg
dexamethasone IV q6 hours per neuro after bleeding brain
metastasis found. Pt has partially obstructing lesion of rt main
stem bronchus which appeared larger on repeat chest CT and may
be cause of wheeze, although held on interventional pulomary at
this time. Pt had video swallow to rule out aspiration which was
negative, but S and S recommeded having meds in applesauce and
swallowing twice with all food consistencies. She was continued
on standing MDI's of fluticasone and combivent with albuterol
nebulizer treatments prn.
2. NSCLCA-Held taxotere therapy since pt was acutely ill. Hct
remained stable so we discontinued her outpatient procrit.
Bleeding in brain initially thought to be embolic although MRI
was more suggestive of bleeding metastasis. Kept all options
open so Neuro/Onc consulted and made plan for stereotactic
radioablation and have pt seen in tumor clinic. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**].
Fusion MRI obtained per Neuro/Onc.
3. Change in mental status- Nature of course of mental status
change felt to be due to seizure per neuro and not hemmorhagic
stroke. Pt has no focal neurologic exam findings except for mild
left eye and mouth droop at rest and cont hyprereflexic patellar
and achilles on left, but no loss of strength. Pt initially on
Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis which had been switched [**9-24**]
to Keppra now titraed up to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **].
4. Thrombocytopenia-Initial fall in platelets thought to be due
to platelet clumping and repeat sample in citrate tube suggests
pseudothrombocytopenia. HIT ab sent and held on all heparin use.
Continued to do platelet checks in citrate tube wtih stable
levels.
4. HTN-BP stable and pt started on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for unclear reason so changed back her outpatient Zestril 5mg qd
when transferred back to floor. Pt remains hypertensive with
stable creatinine so titrated up Zestril to 10mg qd.
5. Back pain-Pt with known t4 compression fracture which
coincides with her area of pain. Fracture not thought to be
malignant. Hydrocodone changed to standing oxycontin now
titrated up to 20mg q12 and oxycodone prn for breakthrough.
6. Depression-Pt mood improved and continued on outpatient
Celexa dose.
7. Hypothyroidism-Cont on outpatient dose levothyroxine
 8.Oral thrush-due to high dose steroids. Cont to treat with
nystatin swish and swallow initially but changed to oral
fluconazole.
9. FEN-House diet, cont megace to improve appetite, replete
lytes
10. Px- Pneumoboots, PPI, on agressive bowel regimen
12. Code-DNR/DNI
