.
R tib/fib film ([**10-17**]):
Bimalleolar fracture of the ankle, with severe widening of the
ankle mortise and lateral displacement of the talar dome with
respect to the tibial plafond.  Evaluation of the ankle fracture
is severely limited due to an overlying splint. Right total knee
replacement without evidence of hardware-related complication.
Status post ORIF of a right femoral neck fracture with
persistent deformity of the right femoral head/neck junction.
.
Trauma CXR/pelvis x-ray ([**10-17**]):
12 mm nodule that projects in the right mid lung.  Deformity of
the left 10th rib laterally consistent with a fracture, age
indeterminant.
.
Head CT ([**10-17**]):
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Multiple vague
hypodense foci in the cerebral white matter, consistent with
sequela of chronic small vessel infarction.
.
CT C-cpine ([**10-17**]):
Grade 2 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6, that is probably
degenerative in nature; however, this cannot be unequivocally
distinguished from a traumatic etiology without prior studies
for comparison. Multilevel degenerative changes as well. No
fracture identified.
.
[**10-31**] pMIBI:
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is good.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a predominantly fixed
moderately severe distal anterior and apical perfusion defect
and a predominantly fixed mild septal defect.
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 54%.
No comparison studies.
IMPRESSION: On pharmacologic stress imaging, there is a
predominantly fixed
moderatel distal anterior wall and apical perfusion defect and a
predominantly fixed mild septal defect. There is normal left
ventricular wall motion with an LVEF of 54%.
.
[**10-31**] Pharmacologic Stress Test:
INTERPRETATION: This 83 yo female was referred to the lab for
new
onset atrial fibrillation & CHF. The patient was infused with
0.142
mg/kg/min of IV Persantine over 4 minutes. The patient denied
any arm,
neck, back or chest discomfort throughout the study. There were
no
significant ST segment changes noted beyond baseline. The rhythm
was
atrial fibrillation with rare VPB's. There was an appropriate
hemodynamic response. Persantine was reversed with 125 mg of IV
Aminophylline.
IMPRESSION: No ischemic EKG changes noted beyond baseline. No
anginal
symptoms. Nuclear report sent separately.


Brief Hospital Course:
83F with rate-controlled a-fib, diastolic CHF, COPD, spinal
stenosis, PMR on chronic steroids here with compound R ankle
fracture s/p ORIF.  Her hospital course is as follows:
.
Compound R ankle fracture: Patient was taken to the OR for ORIF.
 Team had trouble closing her wound given her friable skin, and
vac was placed with a plan to close the wound at a later date.
She also had difficulty and had a short stay in the ICU.  The
patient was put on a dilaudid PCA briefly for pain control,
which was stopped after an episode of over sedation and
hypotension after receiving ambien concurrently.  The patient
was taken back to the OR for a wash out on
