Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from CRSU after initial OSH transfer for severe MR and
large mitral valve vegetation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
26F with no significant PMH who was transferred from OSH for 4+
MR and large vegetation on mitral valve seen on echo, now
transferred from the CSRU with endocarditis.
.
The pt was in her usual state of good health until 2 months ago,
when the pt reported "anxiety attacks" with SOB and DOE,
especially in the morning when waking up.  The attacks included
nervousness, shaking, diaphoresis, and mild to moderate dyspnea.
At that time anxiolytics were prescribed by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] new
heart murmur was noted.
.
Over the past 2 weeks, the patient has experienced R-sided
back/hip pain and distal R foot and leg pains with low grade
temperature and diaphoresis. The pain was a sharp, stabbing in
her lower back on the right side, worsening with change of
position and walking; standing up was excrutiating. No
anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness, or stool or urine
incontinence.  She saw her PCP again who prescribed diazepam,
motrin and after a second visit, because of no significant
improvement, percocet with some relief.
.
Since Sunday [**5-17**], the patient has noted LE edema R>L, improving
when elevating the leg, worse on the evening. The swelling was
accompanied by SOB and a localized intermittent R sided chest
pain, orthopnea, no PND, no nocturia. Additionally, she
described her right ankle as painful, walking and weight bearing
possible.
.
In the past week the pt had worsening 'anxiety attacks' with
tachycardia, diaphoresis, and SOB occurring more frequently and
worse than before. On Thursday [**5-19**], she saw her PCP who advised
her to get an outpt echo; echo showed mitral regurgiation 4+ and
large vegetation on the mitral valve. She was transferred to
[**Hospital6 33**] initially.  Blood cultures were drawn and
the patient was then transferred to the CSRU at [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical evaluation for consideration of MVR.  Ctx's grew GPC in
chains. She was started on Vancomycin and Gentamycin IV on [**5-19**].
.
Since that time, blood cultures have been positive for Viridans
strep, and abx coverage switched to PCN and Gentamycin IV.  Echo
showed
.
She denies any skin infection, recent dental work, sexual
activity, PNA, other recent procedures, bleeding, pedicures,
palpitations, CP.  She does admit some prior L mandibular molar
pain which she attributed to wisdom tooth eruption.

Past Medical History:
none

Social History:
The patient moved out from her parents home 6 months ago but
came back after she started having the "anxiety attacks". She

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12226**] was admitted to the general medical service as a
transfer from CRSU on [**2135-5-21**].

A/P: 26F with subacute bacterial endocarditis, with large
vegetation seen on mitral valve and severe mitral regurgitation.
.
# SBE - Pt presented with new cardiac murmur, vegetations on the
mitral valve, no obvious risk factors. She did mention possible
eruption of new molar with some tooth pain recently. ESR and CRP
very high. On exam she had signs of CHF and a new murmur,
without splinter hemorrhages, Osler or [**Last Name (un) 1003**] nodes, or
mucousal bleeding. Strep viridans grew on OSH and [**Hospital1 18**] blood
cultures, sensitive to clindamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin,
and PCN. HIV negative. HBs-AB pos, HBc-AB neg, HCV-AB neg. Pt
was started on IV PCN and Gentamycin until sensitivities
returned, then kept on PCN alone. Prior to discharge, d/c'd IV
PCN, switched to IV ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h for ease of dosing.
The pt went home on IV CFTX, to follow up in clinic with ID and
CT surgery, with plan to return for MVR. PICC in place, right
arm. Weekly CBC, LFTs should be faxed to [**Hospital **] clinic on d/c
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**]. Outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic in 2-3wks after discharge.
.
# Hemodynamics - Pt wit mild CHF physiology on admission due to
MR 4+ resulting from infection-induced valvular damage. Evidence
of mild fluid overload on CT. Previously with mild bibasilar
crackles, largely absent within 1-2days on the medical floor.
Lasix and Lisinopril d/c'd due to symptomatic hypotension
afternoon of [**5-22**], with lightheadedness and BP of 68/41. Good
response to IVF boluses 500cc NS x 4 that night, SBPs in 90s,
seems to be her baseline. No symptoms of lightheadedness after
that one experience, no orthostasis. Followed EKG's for possible
heart block. Plan for MVR in 4-6wks depending on stability.
Repeatedly enforced idea that outpatient hydration is crucial,
and no real exercise next 1 month.
.
# Anemia - Pt with known microcytic anemia, on Fe at home as of
recently. Iron studies c/w ACD. Retic elevated/appropriate, B12
WNL. Pt was typed + screened for potential future transfusion of
PRBCs
.
# Right back, ankle pain. Pt presented with 5 days of new right
back pain/achiness in costovertebral region and right ankle
pain. Back pain was concerning for septic emboli to joint or
possibly to kidney. Small wedge-shaped kidney infarct seen on
CT. MRI with fluid in the sacroiliac joint, surrounding edema,
incidental femur endochondroma. MRI right ankle showing no
evidence of osteomyelitis, small tibiotalar joint effusion,
lateral malleolus edema. No cellulitis on ankle exam. Mild
tenderness to deep palpation right back/CVA. Pain was r
