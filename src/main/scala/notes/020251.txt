Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Substernal chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart chateterization
Coronary angiography
Drug eluting stent, 1st v/LAD.
Anterolateral MI, Initial care (ICD 410.01)

History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with questionable history of borderline HTN and
hypercholesterolemia untreated, developed SSCP on the day of
admission while shoveling snow.  Pt. describes initial sx as a
"rawness" in his chest, progressing to a [**5-26**] band-like pain
across his chest, radiating to neck and shoulders bilaterally,
with diaphoresis and nausea/vomiting.  He took 2 ASA.  His pain
persisted for 15-20 minutes, so he went to [**Hospital6 33**].
 Initial EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in II, III, as well as [**Street Address(2) 13234**] elevations in V1-V2, and 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in V5-V6.
His initial CEs were negative.  He had VF x 10 episodes,
shocked, and reverted to NSR.  He was placed on amiodarone,
intubated for airway protection, and given streptokinase with
decreased ST elevations, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.

Here he was placed on NTG, heparin, and amiodarone was
continued.  He had recurrent VF x [**3-21**], was defibrillated.  He
became hemodynamically stable and was extubated with plans for
cath in a.m.  However, he continued to have episodes of VF, with
a repeat EKG showing [**Street Address(2) 7565**] elevations in the precordial
leads, therefore he was taken emergently to cath where he was
found to have a mid-LAD lesion with some perfusion.  He was
stented and transferred to the CCU for observation.

Past Medical History:
Borderline hypercholesterolemia and HTN a year ago, however
hadn't seen a physician in over 10 years prior to this.

Social History:
Smoked 1 PPD x 30 years, quit 5 years ago.  Smoked a pipe x 40
years.  In the past drank 4 drinks/day for years, now 1
drink/month.

Family History:
Brother 2 years older alive and well.  Mother with CHF, Father
deceased from MI at age 58.

Physical Exam:
VS: 97.2, 65, 111/72, RR 18, 100% 5L NC.
Gen:  Well-built caucasian male appearing comfortable, resting
in bed.
Neck: No JVD.
Lungs:  CTA b/l from anterior chest.
CVS: RR, normal rate, no murmurs/rubs/gallops.
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND.
Extr: No c/c/e.  R groin without bruits or masses. DP/PT

CXR [**3-10**]:  The lung volumes are low. Allowing for this factor,
the heart is upper limits of normal in size. The mediastinum is
slightly prominent, also likely due to accentuation by low lung
volumes as well as portable technique. There is hazy increased
opacity at the lung bases, which may be due to superimposition
of soft tissues of the chest wall. It is difficult to fully
exclude focal parenchymal opacity at the right base. No pleural
effusions or pneumothoraces are identified.
IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes limiting assessment. Repeat radiograph with
improved inspiratory effort would be helpful for more complete
evaluation of the cardiomediastinal contours as well as the lung
bases.

COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system with
1 vessel CAD. The LMCA was angiographically without significant
disease.
The proximal LAD did not show flow limiting stenoses. There was
a
thrombus in the mid LAD causing a 40% stenosis. The distal LAD
was free
of flow limiting stenoses angiographically. There was a
significant
Ramus intermedius without significant disease. The LCX and the
RCA did
not have flow limiting stenoses angiographically.
  2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed mild pulmonary
hypertension (PA
mean 27 mmHg). The right and left sided filling pressures were
mildly
elevated (RA mean 13 mmHg, RVEDP 17 mmHg, PCW mean 17 mmHg).
  3. Successful stenting of the LAD with two 3.0 mm Cypher
drug-eluting
stents. Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no
dissection and
normal flow (see PTCA comments).
  4. The right femoral arterotomy was closed using a sealant
device
(Angioseal).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful stenting of the LAD.

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. LV
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Distal anterioseptal and
apical
hypokineisis is present.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old male without significant PMHx, presented with
anterior ST elevation MI, status post thrombolytics at outside
hospital, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] status post multiple episodes of
VT/VF, for cardiac catheterization.

1) CAD: The patient was transferred to the catheterization lab
from the ED after further episodes of VF, with increased size of
ST elevations (as described in HPI).  In the cath lab he was
found to have an acute thrombus in his LAD, which was stented
with a ciphe
