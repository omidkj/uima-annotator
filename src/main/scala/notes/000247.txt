Service:

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a history of critical AS, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, tachy-brady syndrome, who
presented to the Emergency Room with chest pain.  In the ED,
the blood pressure was noted to be elevated at 230-270
systolic.  The patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin,
hydralazine, and subsequently her blood pressure decreased
into the 80s.  The patient was then noted to have ST segments
in V4 through V6 and substernal chest pain started after
eating.  The patient reports that the chest pain was [**10-13**],
squeezing sensation.  .................... The patient
reports an episode of similar pain months ago.  The patient
denied any dyspnea on exertion, however, she does report
lightheadedness.  In the ED, the patient was subsequently
started on Neo-Synephrine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  SVT, tachy-brady syndrome.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  AS with valve area 0.7 cm squared.
5.  Arthritis.
6.  TR 2+.
7.  MR 2+.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zantac 150 b.i.d.
2.  Lisinopril 10.
3.  Aspirin 325.
4.  Betoptic.
5.  .................... eyedrops.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her sister on a
[**Location (un) 1773**] apartment.  She denied any smoking, tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.8, blood pressure 130/50s, heart rate 80s, respiratory
rate 20, saturating 100% on nonrebreather face mask.
General:  The patient is an elderly female.  HEENT:  Moist
mucous membranes.  Her neck was supple.  There was slow
upstroke and positive murmur bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular
rate with a harsh 3/4 systolic ejection murmur at the right
upper and lower sternal border.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds
with a transmitted murmur.  Extremities:  No clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chem-7 with a sodium of 134,
potassium 4.9, chloride 97, bicarbonate 24, BUN 30,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 121.  White blood cell count 11.6,
hematocrit 31.2, platelets 264,000, 92.8% neutrophils, no
bands.

On admission, her CK MB was 4.  Her troponin was 1.01.

A chest x-ray, AP portable, revealed questionable focal
infiltrate.

The EKG at admission was bradycardiac in the 40s, normal
axis, biphasic T waves in V2, otherwise unchanged.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was with critical AS,
hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, presenting with
substernal chest pain.  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service for further evaluation and management.

The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service and the cardiac
enzymes were cycled and were negative.  The [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course has been complicated, while awaiting cardiac
catheterization to evaluate valve for possible coronary
artery disease, by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation
and hypotension.  During the same time, the patient also
developed a fever and an elevated white count and it was felt
that this episode was due to urosepsis.  Given persistent
supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension, the patient was
transferred to the CCU.

The patient was started on IV Amiodarone and broad spectrum
antibiotic therapy.  The patient's heart rate was improved
and the patient converted back to sinus rhythm.  She was
transitioned to p.o. Amiodarone and transferred back to the
floor during this admission.  Her urinary cultures
subsequently grew out E. coli and her antibiotics were
adjusted.

The patient did convert back into atrial fibrillation and did
have some pauses noted on telemetry.  Electrophysiology
service was recommended.   Discontinue Amiodarone.  They will
determine the need for a pacemaker in the long run once the
patient resolves her current medical issues.  Furthermore, it
was determined not to perform cardiac catheterization during
admission.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Critical aortic stenosis.
2.  Urosepsis.
3.  Tachy-brady syndrome.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Please refer to page one.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Cardiology per
page one.
