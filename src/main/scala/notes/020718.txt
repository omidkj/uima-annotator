Chief Complaint:
Fever and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunneled line removal

History of Present Illness:
60 year old male with h/o seizure disorder, ESRD on HD with
persistent tunneled line infection (changed over wire in [**11-2**]),
nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF30-35%), remote h/o MI and CVA,
and hepatitis B who presented to the ED from HD after fever to
103F. Per records patient had persistent purulent drainage from
his
tunnel site unresponsive to antibiotic treatment, but without
systemic signs of infection or bacteremia. In [**11-2**] the catheter
was changed over a wire. Subsequently he developed a contact
dermatitis at the line site treated with clobetasol per
dermatology recs.
 He was in his USOH until this morning when he arrived at HD and
had a fever to 103F. He was given Vanc/Gent at HD after cultures
were drawn. he was also hypotensive prior to HD but he completed
treatment at HD with 4.3kg removed. After HD was hypotensive to
the 60s and thus transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].
 On arrival to the ED VS: T:98.6 HR:110 BP:93/61 RR:18.  Also
had EJ placed and then right CVL placed in groin. Per renal ok
to use HD line in groin for pressors. Currently on levophed for
BPs 85/46 prior to coming to floor. Otherwise mentating well,
afebrile while in the ED.
.
On arrival to the floor: patient has no complaints except he is
hungry and tired.
.
Review of systems: Denies any recent shortness of breath,
dizziness, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE [**Date range (3) 20489**]

# Septic Shock: Patient is usually hypertensive and on last
admission to MICU he had BP 120s/70s so definitely not at his
baseline on admission. He was presumed initially to have septic
shock given the fevers at HD. He was started on levophed in the
ED and Vancomycin + gent. He remained hypotensive and febrile
and on [**1-5**] his tunneled HD line was removed. After this his
blood pressures were better and he was able to be weaned off
levophed. Blood cultures from the HD line grew staph aureus,
that was ultimately found to be oxacillin resistant. He was
continued on Vanco dosed by levels and gentamycin was
discontinued per renal recommendations. A TTE was done which did
not reveal any vegetations but did have AR so patient was
ordered for a TEE to be done after transfer to the floor. Pt was
transferred to the floor for further management.  His femoral
line was pulled on [**2119-1-8**] to give the patient a true line
holiday until [**2119-1-10**].  Daily vancomcyin troughs were drawn and
he was given small boluses of vancomycin 750mg PRN to keep
Vancomycin trough close to 20.  The patient remained afebrile
and his serial cultures continued to be negative.  ID was
consulted and they recommended Continuing IV vancomycin to be
dosed by HD protocol.  Lab results would be faxed to [**Hospital **] clinic
and they will be adjusted as needed.
.
# ESRD on HD: Last had HD on day of admission and while in the
ICU had no acute need for HD, electrolytes currently within
normal limits. Dialysis fellow was aware of admission and
followed patient while in the ICU. After the HD line was pulled
pt had a line holiday until [**2119-1-10**] when a temporary line was
placed.  Daily labs and volume status were closely monitored,
but the patient did not require urgent dialysis during his line
holiday.  On [**2119-1-11**] a permanent tunnelled line was placed and
the patient was ready for discharge with scheduled dialysis as
before.

# cardiomyopathy and h/o MI: Patient's TTE (done to assess for
vegetations) shows slightly worsening ejection fraction and
regional wall motion abnormality than prior. Although was
hypotensive is HD dependent for fluid balance so did not bolus
fluids given would not be able to dialyze off with line holiday.
ACE inhibitor was held. Zocor 20mg po daily was restarted when
eating.

# History of seizure disorder: Continued oxcarbazepine and
levtiricetam.  This was not an active issue during the course of
his admission.
