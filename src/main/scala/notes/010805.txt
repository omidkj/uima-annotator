Date of Birth:   [**2078-11-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Medicine
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52 year old
male with a history of idiopathic glomerulonephritis, status
post renal transplant times two, most recent in [**2128**], seizure
disorder (on Depakote), status post subtotal
parathyroidectomy, and hypertension (on Norvasc, labetalol) who
was admitted for decreased urine output.  This spring, he had had
several episodes of acute renal failure and his creatinine had
been drifting up. He had also developed profound hypocalcemia
which suggested worsened renal function.  For this reason, a
renal biopsy was performed electively 5 days prior to
admission.  The biopsy was done under ultrasound guidance and
was uncomplicated.  He felt well and returned to work with
strict instructions on heavy lifting restrictions for two
weeks.  On the first of [**Month (only) **], he called his nephrologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], for a dramatic decrease in urine output over the course
of that day with pain over the graft.  He was sent urgently to
the ER for evaluation and renal transplant ultrasound.   The
patient called his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] referred
him to the Emergency Room. In the Emergency Room,
the patient was given morphine sulfate for pain and had
increased potassium and was given D50, insulin, Kayexalate
and calcium gluconate.  For decreased urine output, the
patient underwent straight catheterization with no urine
output.  The patient also had a renal ultrasound which showed a
perinephric hematoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Idiopathic glomerulonephritis,
status post renal transplant times two, most recent in [**2128**].
2.  Seizure disorder, diagnosed at age ten with both [**Doctor Last Name 11332**]
mal and grand mal seizures.  3.  Subtotal parathyroidectomy.
4.  Hypertension.  5.  Lactose intolerance.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no family history of renal disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not use alcohol.  He smoked
three to four packs per day times years but not currently.  The
patient is a
retired broadcaster.  He is divorced with two children.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin (rash), Tegretol and intravenous
contrast.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient's weight was ([**2131-8-5**]) was 168 pounds,
blood pressure 175/79, oxygen saturation 100% in room air.
General:  Patient appeared somnolent but easily arousable.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck:  Carotid bruits,
right greater than left, positive jugular venous distention 6
to 7 cm.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally but poor
effort.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, positive
II/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen:  Pain on palpation,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Genitourinary:  Foley catheter in, no urine output
noted.  Neurologic examination:  Somnolent but alert and
oriented times three, grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at
60 beats per minute, left axis, left ventricular hypertrophy,
T wave slightly peaked in V3 through V6, slight ST
depressions in V5 and V6, I and AVL which are less than 0.5,
noted in the past.

White blood cell count was 7.3 with 67% neutrophils, 20%
lymphocytes, 13% monocytes and 0.3% eosinophils, hematocrit
29.2, platelet count 159,000, MCV 91, prothrombin time 13.1,
partial thromboplastin time 31.5, INR 1.1, sodium 137,
potassium 6, chloride 103, bicarbonate 18, BUN 73, creatinine
4.2, baseline 1.5 to 2.6, glucose 104, anion gap equals 16,
calcium 7.5, albumin 4.1, corrected calcium 7.5, phosphorous
6.5 and magnesium 1.8.  Renal ultrasound on [**2131-8-7**]
after biopsy:  No hydronephrosis, no stones, positive cysts,
no fluid collections, no abnormal resistive index.  Results
of biopsy on [**2131-8-7**]:  No globally sclerotic glomeruli,
mild mesangial prominence and proliferation, mild
glomerulitis, positive patchy interstitial fibrosis, positive
tubular atrophy, positive chronic inflammation, positive
intimal fibroplasia in arterioles, positive single focus of
epitheliitis; impression, consistent with chronic transplant
nephropathy but endothelitis  s is concerning for cellular
rejection.

A renal ultrasound from [**2131-8-12**]:  Impression (1)
perinephric hematoma with mass effect
on the transplant kidney; (2) elevated arterial velocities
with reversal of diastolic flow, no venous flow identified,
findings consistent with renal vein occlusion, likely
secondary to tamponade caused by hematoma, rather than
primary thrombosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 52 year old
male with a history of idiopathic glomerulonephritis, status
post renal transplant in [**2122**] and in [**2128**], complicated by
recent acute renal insufficiency felt secondary to diuretic
use and diarrhea but with continued renal function decline
since [**2131-5-13**], status post renal biopsy [**2131-8-7**]
consistent with chronic cellular rejection and complicated by
hematoma.  Increased abdominal pain was noted on [**2131-8-12**]
and patient became anuric.  The patient required admission on
[**2131-8-13**] for further workup and treatment.

After hospitalization, the patient remained anuric and
required urgent hemodialysis for an increased potassium.  The
patient required dialysis daily during the first week of
admission.  Ultimately, the patient underwent partial evacuation
of
the hematoma on [**2131-8-14**], which was complicated by a
change in mental status, felt secondary to narcotics.  The
day after surgery, the patient experienced a respiratory
acidosis, requiring admission to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.

Given a decreased blood pressure of 85/40 and a white blood
cell count of 28, there was also concern for a postoperative
sepsis, but blood cultures have remained negative to date.
In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was treated
with Narcan and BIPAP.  It was felt that the patient had
improved mental status and arterial blood gases.  His course
was complicated by a decreased calcium, requiring several
ampules of calcium gluconate supplement, and by a gradually
falling hematocrit.

The patient was placed on Levaquin and clindamycin times two
days but was these were discontinued when blood cultures
remained negative.  He had no urine output despite a Lasix
challenge, except for 0.5 cc, which did not reveal white
blood cell casts on examination.

On [**2131-8-19**], the patient was afebrile and was
hemodynamically stable.  The patient was deemed stable for
transfer back to the medicine team.  On arrival to the floor,
the patient seemed somewhat lethargic although arousable.  He
was oriented times three and complained of mild abdominal
pain, but denied chest pain, shortness of breath or fever.

Since [**2131-8-19**], the patient has remained hemodynamically
stable but has had no change in mental status since arriving
from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient had
symptoms of delirium and, as reported by his son, has been
seen talking to nonexistent people and experienced other
hallucinations.  The patient has been noted to have periods
of being lucid but, otherwise, is not oriented to time or
place or person.

At this time, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head
with gadolinium was attempted but the patient was combative
during the examination and was sent back to the floor.  It
was felt that sedation at this point would be unwise, as the
patient has been lethargic since admission.  It was felt that
the risks of putting the patient in respiratory acidosis
again would outweigh the benefits of the magnetic resonance
imaging scan at this time.

A CT scan was done to rule out any mass lesions or effect and
it was noncontributory.  A lumbar puncture was deferred at
