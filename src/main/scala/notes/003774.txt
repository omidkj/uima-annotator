Chief Complaint:
Shortess of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath [**2137-12-24**]

History of Present Illness:
72 yo F who presented to OSH [**2137-12-22**] after having an episode of
shortness of breath which woke her from sleep.  Stress test
[**2137-12-23**] demonstrated inferior infarct, post-lat ischemia, EF
40%.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath which demonstrated complete
occlusion  of the RCA, LM (50%, 70% distal)  LAD 70% ostial, D1
50%, LCx small totally occluded, 80% ramus.  At this time the
patient denies CP, palpitations, N/V.  She reports SOB,
orthopnea and PND.  The patient is pleasant but a poor historian
due to her dementia and mental retardation.

Cath-
  1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system
with three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 50%
ostial
lesion with 70% distal disease and catheter dampening upon
engagement.
The LAD had a 70% ostial stenosis with a mid vessel 70% lesion
and a 50%
diagonal stenosis. The small occluded LCX system had an 80%
ostial ramus
lesion with serial stenoses up to 80%.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right
sided,
pulmonary, and left sided pressures (LVEDP 21 mmHg, mean PCWP 21
mmHg)
with no gradient upon movement of the catheter from the
ventricle to the
aorta. The cardiac index was normal (2.6 l/min/m2).
  3. Left ventriculography showed mild posterobasal hypokinesis
(EF 45
to 50%) with no mitral regurgitation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Need to evaluate if dementia is multi infarct dementia.

HEAD CT: There is no acute intra- or extraaxial hemorrhage.
Calcifications are present within the basal ganglia. The
ventricles, cisterns, and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation are
unremarkable. The cerebellum is atrophic. There is no mass
effect and no shift of normally midline structures. The osseous
structures, mastoid air cells, and visualized paranasal sinuses
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION

1. No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. No areas of old infarction identified.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE
FINDINGS:

Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
There is mild to moderate plaque noted bilaterally in the
proximal ICA.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 105, 84, and 170 cm
per second in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA
end-diastolic velocity is 30 cm per second. The ICA to CCA ratio
is 1.3. This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 183, 105, and 359 cm
per second in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA
end-diastolic velocity is 43 cm per second. The ICA to CCA ratio
is 1.2. This is consistent with 60-69% stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery. The left
vertebral was not visualized.

IMPRESSION:

Less than 40% right ICA stenosis, 60-69% left ICA stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F with severe CAD  and diabetes, found to have severe 3
vessel disease on Cath.

1) CV
--Ischemia -Patient was found to have 3 Vessel disease on
cardiac cath. She was referred to the Cardiothoracic surgeons
for evaluation and was subsequently accepted. Psychiatry was
consulted and deemed the patient to have capacity to consent for
CABG. Neuro was consulted and they recommended a head CT to
evaluate for multi infarct dementia which was unrevealing for
any pathology and a carotid ultrasound series which showed less
than 40% right ICA stenosis, 60-69% left ICA stenosis. She was
then transferred to the Cardiothoracic team for further
management of her disease.
--Pump: known EF of 40%.
--Rhythm: NSR, on tele
She was continued on lopressor, lisinopril, and lipitor
throughout stay.

2) Diabetes -give [**1-25**] of home insulin dose because not eating
her regular diet.
           -cover with humalog SS
3) Psych -continued on outpatient medications.
4) Glaucoma - cont cosopt and alphagan
5) FEN - Cardiac/Diabetic Diet
6) PPx - Heparin SC, bowel regimen, lansoprazole.
7) Transferred to Cardiothoracic surgery. Rest of hospital
course to be dictated by surgery.
