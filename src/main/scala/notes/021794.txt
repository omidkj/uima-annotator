Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 711**] is an 84 M with h/o MI, CABG, CHF presents with 4
days of worsening mildly productive cough. On the night before
admission, his cough worsened and he felt warm with a fever to
101. He tried his wife's albuterol which did not help. He denies
SOB, sore throat, congestion, chest pain, lightheadedness,
headache, dysuria/frequency, abdominal pain,
diarrhea/constipation. Over the past month, he has reduced his
salt intake and lost 25 lbs after being in congestive heart
failure. He no longer has any lower extremity edema. He recently
had shingles over his right eye.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 100 94 117/46 18 95/ 2LNC. Exam
bilateral rales, R>L crackles. ED staff initially felt he had a
possible LLL opacity and gave him azithro 500mg and ceftriaxone
1gm, but his final read felt there was no focal infiltrate, just
some mild vascular engorgement. His SBP was in the 120s for the
first couple of hours, and he was initially signed out to the
general medical floor, but prior to transfer, his SBP dipped to
the 80s so he was given 1 L NS plus another 500cc. His SBP
remained in the 85-95 range with sats in the mid 90s on 2-3L.
His BNP is 5805, at his baseline. His lactate was 2.9 and his Cr
3.0 (baseline around 2.5-2.8). EKG afib 78, old inf Qs,
unchanged. A UA was negative. He has 2 PIVs. He will get the
rest of his second liter on transport to the MICU.
.
On the floor, he appears well and endorses the above HPI, though
his SBP is in the 80s. He has 150cc of urine in the foley that
was placed in the ED. He is mentating well and satting in the
mid 90s on 2L.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied
shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

[**2108-5-9**] MRSA screen: negative
[**2108-5-9**] 11:18 am Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture
   Source: Nasopharyngeal swab.
   Respiratory Viral Culture: PARAINFLUENZA VIRUS TYPE 3.
CONFIRMED BY MONOCLONAL FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY.
   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen: Positive for Respiratory
viral antigens. Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1,
2, 3, Influenza A, B, and RSV by immunofluorescence. Refer to
Respiratory Virus Identification for further information.
   Respiratory Virus Identification: POSITIVE FOR PARAINFLUENZA
VIRUS. Viral antigen identified by immunofluorescence. Unable to
serotype parainfluenza due to insufficient cellular content of
sample. Refer to respiratory viral culture for further
information.
[**2108-5-9**]: Legionella urinary antigen: negative
[**2108-5-11**]: Blood cultures x 2: no growth
.
EKG [**2108-5-9**]: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Prior inferior myocardial infarction. Low limb lead
voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2108-4-26**] no
diagnostic interim change.
.
Imaging:
.
CXR PA and lateral [**2108-5-9**]: Heart is enlarged. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
are compatible with history of CABG. There is no evidence of
pneumonia. Reticular opacities at the lung bases likely
represent chronic lung disease, grossly unchanged since prior
exam. Hyperinflated lungs are compatible with known COPD. Study
is limited as both costophrenic angles are not included in the
image. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with no pulmonary edema or
pneumonia.
.
CXR PA and lateral [**2108-5-16**]: Since most recent prior radiograph,
there has been interval improvement of interstitial pulmonary
edema to baseline subtle mild interstitial prominence. No focal
parenchymal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Interval
development of small bilateral pleural effusions is noted. There
is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
stable demonstrating mild cardiomegaly and post-CABG and
sternotomy changes. IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of
interstitial pulmonary edema. Interval development of small
bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise, no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:

fever, and low blood pressure without clear radiographic
evidence of pneumonia.
