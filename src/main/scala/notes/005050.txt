Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, mechanical fall, cardiopulmonary arrest.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Endotracheal intubation.
2) GJ tube placement


History of Present Illness:
85 yo M with h/o Parkinson's, hypercholesterolemia, HTN, now
admitted to CCU s/p arrest. Per wife, pt woke her up on morning
of admission stating that he had been having chest pain, had
already taken 6 NTG tablets, but the pain was still present. She
states he was also c/o SOB. She called EMS and the pt was given
162mg aspirin and transported to the ED and was CP free on
arrival. CXR showed pulmonary edema and he was given 40mg IV
lasix. ECG showed ST depressions in V4-V6 but old ECG read from
[**5-1**] had called the same (actual ECG not able to be obtained).
Wife gave history that he had sustained several falls recently,
the last being 2 days PTA when he had tripped over a wire. He
was unable to get up and his wife called EMS who helped him
stand up but he stated he did not want to go to the hospital at
that time. She states he had been feeling well since then,
eating well with no complaints.
.
In the ED he was sent for a head CT and before this study was
performed he was found unresponsive. Pacer pads were placed and
he was agonal with a HR of 36. Was given 1mg IV epinephrine and
rate increased to 164. He was intubated and a R femoral central
line was placed. A foley was placed and revealed 50cc urine. He
was given 10mg IV Lopressor, 25mg po lopressor, and another 80mg
IV lasix. Another ECG was checked and showed resolution of ST
depressions in V4-6 and cardiology was called. He was then
started on a heparin gtt and given plavix 600mg and Sinemet
25/100 via NGT. He was given 2mg ativan IV for sedation and
transferred to the CCU.

____________________________________
Imaging:
EKG: at code NSR, ST depressions in I AVL, V2-V6, elevation in
V1.
after code ST depressions appear to resolve, as does the
elevation in V1
.
CXR:
1. Endotracheal tube in a standard position.
2. Continued moderate congestive heart failure.
3. Bibasilar opacities, which could represent asymmetric
pulmonary edema,
atelectasis, or possible aspiration.
.
[**2188-7-7**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the apex and hypokinesis of the disal half of
the inferolateral wall. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated
(>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There
is focal hypokinesis of the mid-apical free wall. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild 1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a small-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion most
prominent anterior to the right ventricle (1.3cm) without
evidence for hemodynamic compromise. Echocardiographic signs of
tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures.
.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild-moderate pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2188-7-7**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
three vessel disease. The LMCA was without flow limiting
stenoses
angiographically. The LAD was diffusely diseased and had a 60%
stenosis at D1. D1 had an ostial 80% stenosis. The LCX was
diffusely diseased with a proximal 70-80% stenosis. OM1 had a
70% stenosis. The RCA was the dominant vessel, diffusely
diseased witha proximal 70-80% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed mild pulmonary
hypertension (PA mean 27 mmHg). The right and left sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP 17 mmHg, RVEDP 12 mmHg).
The cardiac output was preserved (CO 6.6 l/min, CI 3.4
l/min/m2). There was a peak-to-peak gradient of 7 mmHg across
the aortic valve upon pull back of the
catheter from the left ventricle into the aorta.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

PERC G/J TUBE CHECK Study Date of [**2188-7-21**] 7:33 AM RELIMINARY
REPORT:  14 French  gastrojejunostomy catheter was placed with
tip in the jejunum.  Feedings can commence in 24 hours which
would be at approximately 6 p.m. on [**2188-7-22**].

The NG tube should be kept in situ until noon on [**2188-7-22**],
and should be placed to suction.

The patient has a hiatus hernia with gastroesophageal reflux and
therefore a gastrojejunostomy catheter was placed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 85 year-old man with history significant for
P.D., HTN who presented on [**7-6**] with chest pain.

Per CCU, patient was taken to the ED where CXR showed pulmonary
edema. He was given lasix. ECG showed lateral ST depressions. He
had also had several falls recently, so in ED taken for head CT.
In the rads suite, found unresponsive and bradycardic. He was
given epi (HR>>160s) and intubated. He was also started on
heparin gtt and loaded with plavix for concern of ACS.
Subsequently, he was taken for cath which showed 3 vd. No
intervention was performed and pt was deemed a poor surgical
candidate for CABG, so decision was to medically manage his CAD.
His arrest for felt secondary to hypoxia from CHF +/- aspiration
pneumonia. He was started on levo/flagyl (vanco for brief
period) and diuresed. Extubated on [**7-8**]. He has had several
episodes of acute pulmonary edema since then that have responded
to lasix, and several episodes of angina that respond to
nitrates. His current issue is dysphagia after extubation. He
failed swallow studies and had a NGT for feeding and meds.
While he was awaiting for his PEG placement he was off plavix
for one week.
.
The following issues were addressed after transfer to floor:

1) RECENT CHEST PAIN. Patient with cardiac catheterization
showing 3 vessal coronary artery disease, not CABG candidate,
being medically managed. Patient was maintained on Aspirin,
Zocor, ACE, and BB, and later while waiting for his PEG he was
on IV Metoprolol.  Plavix was held while patien
