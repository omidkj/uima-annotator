History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 89-year-old male who presented on [**2154-6-8**] with
blood per rectum, which prompted a colonoscopy. A
circumferential tumor was found 10 cm from the anal verge and a
biopsy showed invasive adenocarcinoma, which was moderately
differentiated. The plan was for resection, but it was postponed
as the patient was anemic and had an episode of CHF. The patient

his CHF, and was discharged 3 days later. The patient underwent
radiation therapy as well as neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now
presents for definitive treatment for his rectal cancer.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2154-10-14**] and was
evaluated by cardiology prior to procedure. He was prepared the
night before with a bowel prep and hibiclens scrub to his
abdomen, as well as IV flagyl and cefazolin for prophylaxis. The
patient was taken to the operating room that day, where he
underwent a low anterior resection. The patient required 1 unit
of PRBC's intraoperatively. During the case, metastases to the
liver were noted. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain as well as a feeding
J-tube were place. The post-operative course was complicated by
acute episodes of confusion and by episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation and hypertension. On POD#1, tube feedings were
started via the patient's J-tube. On post-operative day #2, the
patient experienced bouts of rapid atrial fibrillation, which
required IV metoprolol to control. On post-operative day #3, the
patient received IV lasix for diuresis, which he responded to
well. He also began working with the physical therapists and was
able to sit up to chair. On post-operative day #4, the patient
was started on zestril for hypertension. On the night of
post-operative day #4, the patient became acutely confused and
removed his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain. Later that night, the patient's
telemetry alarm went off secondary to tachycardia to 160 BPM.
The patient was found breathing rapidly and was unresponsive to
stimuli. He was found to have an oxygen saturation of 60% on
2LNC, which improved to greater than 90% on a non-rebreathing
face mask. The patient became more responsive, and was
immediately transferred to the ICU for a CHF exacerbation. Chest
x-ray at the time demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, and
lasix was given. A right internal jugular central venous line
was placed and a right thoracentesis was performed, at which
time 1.5 liters of pleral fluid were drained. The patient was
agressively diuresed in the ICU, where his cardiac status was
closely monitored. On POD#8, the patient had an unwitnessed fall
from his bed. Though he was uninjured, he was monitored closely
and a sitter was placed at bedside. The patient was medically
stable the following day, and was sent to the floor. He was
evaluated by the hepatic surgery team as well as the medical
oncology team, though no consensus was reached during his
hospital stay as far as what treatment, if any, will be
necessary for his metastatic disease to his liver. Following
transfer to the floor, attention was turned to agressivley
rehabilitating and feeding the patient. The patient worked with
the physical therapists, ate regular meals and tolerated tube
feeds at night without any incidents or episodes of confusion.
On post-operative day #12, the patient is now stable for
discharge to an extended care facility.
