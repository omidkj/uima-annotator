Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8263**]
Chief Complaint:
paraparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
fusion Laminectomy Lumbar T9-S1 with instrumentation and
allograft

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with a PMH significant for polio (residual
right lower extremity weakness and atropy), DMII (not on
medications), HTN, diastolic HF with a preserved EF, CAD
(described on CT) with angina symptoms relieved by SL nitro, who
presented for evaluation for paraparesis since [**Month (only) **] of this
year. He was found to have severe central stenosis from T9-S1
and extensive spondylosis on recent MRI. He underwent fusion
Laminectomy Lumbar T9-S1 with instrumentation and allograft and
was admitted to TSIUC for post operative care.  He was
successfully extubated without issue on [**10-26**], but developed a
new O2 requirement of 4L NC which he does not have at home. He
was tachycardic and hypertensive with SBPs to the 160s systolic,
and HR ranging 90s-110s.
.
He has also had 2 episodes of CP with negative enzymes, relieved
by SL nitro and no changes in his EKG. To his recollection he
has never had a heart attack, he has never had a stent placed,
and never had a cardiac catheterization.
.
Currently patients complains of productive cough.  He is a
chonic smoker and at baseline coughs every day however his cough
has become more productive with clear/yellow sputum which he
attributes to having stopped smoking since admission.  He
reports having chest pain only during coughing.  Denies any
pleuritic chest pain.  Denies any significant shortness of
breath.  Reports sleeping on two pillows at home but denies any
PND.  He has had one episode CHF many years ago.  He was
recently started on lasix for worsening peripheral edema.
.
On review of systems he reports feeling very bloated. He's
passing gas, and has had 1BM since admission, but is very
uncomfortable.  Reports pain is somewhat controlled on IV
dilauded.  He has not noticed any changes in his lower extremity
weakness of numbness since surgery.


Past Medical History:
Diastolic Heart Failure with preserved EF - recently started on
Lasix by his PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**10-16**] with LVH and preserved EF.
Hypertension c/b LVH
CAD c/b angina, unknown history of MI, caths

Social History:
He's from [**Hospital1 189**]. He has residual weakness on the right side
from Polio and has been unable to ambulate on the left secondary
to pain and spinal disease for which he was operated on this
admission. He is a 1ppd smoker since age 12.  He drinks 6-8
drinks per week.  He denies any IVDU.   He drinks socially,
denies any drug use.

CXR: [**2197-10-25**]
FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The patient
has been
extubated with removal of OG tube.  Right IJ sheath terminates
in the proximal SVC.  Cervical fusion devices and thoracolumbar
fusion device is incompletely imaged.  Heart size and
cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Widespread bilateral
heterogeneous opacities are compatible with mild pulmonary
edema.  Right upper lobe atelectasis is improved.  Left lung
atelectasis is stable.  No pneumothorax.
.
IMPRESSION:  Interval extubation.  Mild pulmonary edema, similar
to prior.  Improved right upper lobe atelectasis and stable left
atelectasis.
.
CXR: [**2197-10-29**]
Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are
essentially
unchanged since [**10-27**] but there is greater opacification
in the left lower chest including more consolidation in the left
lower lobe either atelectasis or pneumonia and increasing
small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.

T- and L-Spine Film [**2197-10-31**]
1. Status post anterior and posterior cervical fusion. Surgical
hardware
appears intact.
2. Multilevel degenerative disc disease throughout the
thoracolumbar spine,
status post posterior spinal fusion of the lower thoracolumbar
spine.
Surgical hardware appears intact.
3. Diffuse bone demineralization with no evidence for
compression fracture.
4. Mild degenerative joint disease of the hips.

Spine CT [**2197-11-1**]
1. No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
2. Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes as described above.

3. Breached screw through the superior endplate above the
intervertebral disc of T9.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male history of polio, DMII, HTN, diastolic  CHF,
CAD (described on CT) with angina symptoms, who underwent T9-S1
decompression and fusion transfered to medicine for evalaution
of chest pain, tachycardia and new O2 requirement.
.
ACUTE:
# Hypoxemia: This episode requiring persistent O2 requirement in
the post-surgical period was felt to be multifactorial.  Patient
has extensive history of smoking and CT chest prior to admission
showed interstitial and empysematous changes suggesting possible
COPD.  CXR, in combination with new cough, was consistent with
pneumonia.  DDx also included acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure exacerbation given elaveted JVP, peripheral edema, few
crackles on lung exam and finding of interstial edema on CXR.
