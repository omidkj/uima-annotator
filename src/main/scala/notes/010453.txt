Ct head:IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.

Cxr: [**10-27**]:Stable lingular opacity compared with one year ago,
though new from [**2174**]. Given the nonresolution of this opacity
compared with multiple prior radiographs, CT is recommended to
further evaluate. This followup recommendation was made via the
critical results communication dashboard on [**2177-10-28**].
No evidence of pneumonia or CHF. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
EKG [**10-27**]:
Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block. Downsloping ST
segment
depressions in leads V3-V6 with primary T wave changes in leads
V2-V3.
Cannot exclude ischemia. Compared to tracing of [**2176-10-17**] the ST
segment
depressions are slightly less pronounced.
.
CXR:IMPRESSION: [**10-29**]:New right mid and lower zone opacities
consistent with aspiration/pneumonia. Findings communicated to
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by telephone at the time of review.
.
EGD-normal
colonoscopy-grade 1 hemorrhoids, diverticulosis of the whole
colon


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 y/o man with hx of duodenal ulcer, h pylori [**10-14**], CAD,
Afib, p/w CP and found to have melanotic stools, hct 21, INR
5.0. s/p FFP, vitamin K, PRBC's. EGD normal, colonoscopy shows
diverticulosis without active bleeding.
.
# GIB: Pt was given FFP, vitamin K, PRBCs for goal HCT >30 given
demand ischemia. Pt's anticoagulation was stopped. He had PIV's
placed. Serial HCT's and INR were followed and remained stable.
GI was consulted and performed and EGD which was normal.
Colonoscopy showed grade 1 hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. PT
was placed on a PPI. Pt underwent a capsule endoscopy for which
the results will be followed up as an outpatient. Additionally,
pt was found to have +h.pylori in [**2175**] for which he was not
treated secondary to elevated creatinine. Spoke to GI regarding
this matter who feels that after patient's clinical condition
improves, pneumonia resolves, and is off current antibiotics,
can consider H.pylori treatment as EGD was normal.
.
# Chest pain: Likely demand ischemia in the setting of known CAD
and anemia. Currently chest pain-free. EKG showed changes c/w
prior GIB when he had demand ischemia. No current pain. Aspirin
and coumadin initially held [**1-10**] GIB. ASA eventually restarted.
Repeated sets of cardiac enzymes were flat. Serial EKG's
unchanged. Pt was continued on his home dose statin and Imdur.
However, lasix and ACEI were held [**1-10**] bleed and transiently
elevated creatinine. Small dose lisinopril was restarted. Goal
HCT was >30 and he was transfused accordingly.
.
# Cards rhythm: afib on coumadin. He received FFP and Vitamin K
in the ED. Coumadin and ASA were held [**1-10**] bleed. Scope results
as above. ASA restarted. PT placed on telemetry for monitoring.
.
# CHF: hx of mild systolic CHF thought [**1-10**] CAD (Given his stress
report). Pt appeared clinically euvolemic and transiently
hypovolemic given hypernatremia and elevated creatinine. IVF
were given. Diuretics and ACEI originally held given bleed. Low
dose ACEI restarted. Can consider to increase ACEI to 5mg Qam
and 10mg Qpm and lasix 40mg daily after discharge upon
discussion with the PCP.
.
# SOB: [**10-30**] am, required 5L O2, Pt given Lasix and diuresed.
Placed on O2. Repeat CXR showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia
for which pt was placed on levoflox and flagyl. Sputum culture
was consistent with oropharyngeal flora. PT will be treated with
antibiotics for a total of 10 days. Last dose on [**11-
