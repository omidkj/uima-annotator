History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10594**] is a 55 year-old female who presented in early
[**Month (only) 404**] to [**Hospital3 68**] with sudden onset of midback pain
radiating to the front.  She was diagnosed with a Type B aortic
dissection, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], and at that time was managed
non-operatively with strict blood pressure control and
discharged home on Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg [**Hospital1 **], Losartan 50mg
[**Hospital1 **], and Toprol 100mg daily.

She reports that she has otherwise been in her usual state of
health until the evening prior to presentation (~3AM) when she
had sudden onset of sharp midback pain radiating to the front
similar in nature and character to her last attack in early
[**Month (only) 404**].  The pain had remained constant and she experienced
nausea and vomited once that morning (bilious, nonbloody).  She
further reports that she had been more tired with
shortness-of-breath with exertion since her initial presentation
as well as her legs feeling more tired/weak.  She denied fevers,
chills, headache, dizziness, chest pain, or changes in bowel
habits.  A VNA nurse had been monitoring her blood pressure and
that morning found her systolic blood pressure to be in the
190s.  She has not been able to follow-up with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 32366**], whom she was suppose to see on [**2-27**] but has
re-secheduled to [**3-9**].  She was also re-scheduled to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-10**] with a repeat CT scan.
 A CTA was obtained which showed extention of the dissection and
she was admitted to the vascular surgery service.

[**2147-3-6**] CTA Torso:  IMPRESSION:
1. Contained aortic rupture at the proximal descending thoracic
aorta with small periaortic mediastinal hematoma. Aneurysmal
descending thoracic aorta up to 4.4 cm.
2. Interval progression of type B aortic dissection detailed
above with compromised perfusion of the right kidney.
3. Bilateral pulmonary granulomas and sub-4-mm nodules.

Brief Hospital Course:
Given the findings of the CTA showing extention of the aortic
dissection and recurrence of her pain, Ms. [**Known lastname 10594**] was admitted
to the CVICU and an aline was placed for strict blood pressure
monitoring. She was initially kept NPO and her blood pressure
was controlled with an IV nitroglyercin drip.  As she was pain
free her home medications were restarted.  Despite this, she
remained hypertensive in the 160s and therefore her metoprolol
and losartan were both uptitrated.  Given the continued
hypertension, Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] cardiology service was consulted
as they had previously seen her on her last admission.  Per
their recommendations, the metoprolol, hctz, and losartan were
discontinued and she was started on labetalol and lisinopril
with excellent control.  On HD 3 as she remained pain free she
was started on a clear liquid diet.  However, on HD 4 ([**3-9**]) she
developed recurrent abdominal pain after eating lunch.  She was
therefore made NPO and a repeat CTA was obtained which showed no
change since the CT scan from [**3-6**].  The pain later resolved
after she had a bowel movement. Her diet was subsequently
advanced without difficulty.  At the time of discharge on [**3-12**]
her blood pressure had been well controlled for 2 days without
requiring adjusting of her medications, she was tolerating a
regular diet without pain, and she was ambulating without
difficulty.
