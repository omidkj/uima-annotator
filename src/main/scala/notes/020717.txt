Chief Complaint:
Fungating facial mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Embolization of distal internal maxillary arteries


History of Present Illness:
57 yo man, hx of squamous cell cancer of face, with large
fungating mass, transferred from OSH for second opinion.
.
Admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] [**2-26**] with Hgb/Hct 1.9/6.1 due to
bleeding from mass.  He received 7 units of blood. He also had
an initial leukocytosis of 69 thouusand.  He was evaluated by
oncology who recommended palliative radiation, but he was unable
to tolerate it due to claustrophobia.  He intermittently refused
treatment and was evaluated by psychiatry and thought to be
overall competent.  He was treated with ancef and vancomycin
givne MRSA colonization, as well as acinetobacter and
polymicrobial infection.  He requested discharge AMA on [**3-9**],
but per the records, he subsequently requested transfer to a
tertiary care facility for possible surgical treatment.
.
On review, per the patient, he first noticed the mass in [**1-24**],
and sought medical treatment, but he was refused as he did not
have health insurance.  He did receive some treatment at [**Hospital1 3278**],
where he was initially seen, but he refused the offered surgery
with eye resection and radiation.  He states that the mass grew
to its current size approximately 1 year ago and has been
constant since then.  He tends to pick at it, and cut off pieces
of it.  It has been bleeding slowly for several months.

.
More recently, he went to [**State 792**]Hospital and had a biopsy
which showed squamous cell cancer.  It is unclear what
subseqquently happened.
.
While I was evaluating him, I noticed bleeding from the medial
portion of the mass.  Subseqently, the bleeding accelerated.
Attempt was made to reveal the location of bleeding.  Due to
inability to stop the bleeding, multiple teams were called for
evaluation and treatment, and he was transferred to the ICU.

Past Medical History:

Gen- NAD, cachectic, comfortable in bed but occassionally
picking at face and wound dressing
Skin- erythema and swelling around right eye

face with serosanguinous drainage.
CV- RRR, nl S1, S2 no m/r/g

Abd- + BS, soft, NTND
Ext- no pedal edema, 2+ DP bilat
Neuro- AA+Ox3. Conversational. Has persistent delusions re:
being a miracle and at times states that he thinks his prognosis
is good. However, at other times, acknowledges that he "doesn't
have much time left" and appears to comprehend risks of, for
instance, eating despite failing speech and swallow. Of note, in
the evenings, pt frequently becomes delerious and oriented only
x1.

Pertinent Results:
OSH labs prior to transfer:
Hct 31, WBC 46
Cr 0.7.

Head CT [**3-3**] at OSH:
Large right facial mass with involvement of right orbit, right
maxillary sinus, right mandibular condyle.

Facial bones CT [**3-3**] at OSH:
1.  14 cm mass involving the right side of face with destruction
of much of the right maxillary sinus, involvement or right
orbit, right mandible, and surrounding musculature and
superficial right parotid
2.  2.5 cm cystic area anterior to the right maxiallary antrum
adjacent to the lateral aspect of the right side of the nose,
possibly hematoma, necrosis, or infection
3.  Asymmetry of the soft tissues along lateral posterior aspect
of the right side of the tongue, possibly with local tonsillar
enlargement or soft tissue mass.
4.  Bilateral submandibular and upper julular region adenopathy.

Imaging:
[**2198-3-14**] CT Head and Neck: IMPRESSION: Large fungating/necrotic
right facial mass which, although extensive, does not appear to
have intradural involvement despite bony erosion.
.
[**2198-3-20**] CXR: Imaged left lung widespread opacities are unchanged,
except increasing left retrocardiac opacity, could be
atelectasis. There is no right pleural effusion. The right lung
remains clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are normal.
.
[**2198-3-22**] Video oropharyngeal swallow test: IMPRESSION: There is
gross aspiration of both puree and nectar thick liquid boluses.
Limited evaluation due to the patient's cooperation and physical
status. The swallowing pattern correlate to a Dysphasia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 1, unable to safely tolerate
p.o.




Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57M with squamous carcinoma involvement of right face
and hostory of facial bleeding, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
active facial bleeding.
.
#.Facial Mass: From large fungating growth of squamous cell
carcinoma, requiring 6 units pRBCs in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was intubated
and transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] MICU where he underwent
successful embolization of bilateral sphenopalatine artery.  He
required two more unit of pRBCs after embolization for drifting
HCT associated with oozing from his mass.  Medical Oncology was
consulted and felt there to be no indication for systemic
therapy.  Radiation Oncology was consulted for palliative
radiation; however, this was not pursued as patient was
previously unable to tolerate radiation treatment.  He was
subsequently transferred to the Medicine service where his
hematocrit remained stable until the evening of [**3-24**] when he
again developed a brisk bleed from his facial mass.  He was
transfused 4 units PRBC's, and a tamponade dressing was placed.
Repeat embolization procedure was discussed with Neuro IR, but
the decision was made not to proceed with the procedure as the
patient would again have to be electively intubated for the
procedure and the bleeding had subsided with conservative
measures.  A meeting was held involving the ICU team, Ethics,
Social Work and Palliative Care where it was decided that there
would not be any more interventions for this mass and that it
was within the province of the physicians treating the patient
to decide not to intervene in this situation. Dressing changes
were continued per wound care recommendations
.
#. Respiratory Status: Patient underwent nasotracheal intubation
in preparation for elective embolization by Neuro IR.  The
placement of his nasotracheal tube was never ideal and was not
able to be passed further because it was already hubbed to his
nose.  Following embolization, patient became hypoxic and
self-extubated.  He was emergently taken to the OR for
reintubation.  This time he was able to be intubated orally.
Subsequently, he was found to have total collapse of his left
lung, likely secondary to the interval development of copious
secretions and a presume VAP.   He underwent bronchoscopy for
reexpansion of the left lung.  He was treated with an 8-day
course of Vancomycin and Zosyn for a ventilator-associated
pneumonia.  Secretions gradually improved, and he was extubated
on [**2198-3-20**] successfully.  His code status was subsequently
revised to include a Do Not Intubate order.
.
#. Wound: Cultured with acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and
MSSA. He was initially covered with cefazolin and ciprofloxacin
with clindamycin for oral sec
