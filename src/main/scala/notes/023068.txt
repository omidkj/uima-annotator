Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
 ST-elevations on EKG, concern for STEMI at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization


History of Present Illness:
77 y/o woman with a PMhx of metastatic lung cancer with mets to
bone & h/o malignant pleural effusion, who is transferred from
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for cardiac catheterization after she
was found to have ST-elevations in V2-6, I and aVL.
.
The patient initially presented to LMH on [**2127-5-3**] with right hip
pain. She was found to have an intertrochanteric fracture of the
R hip, which was thought to be pathologic in nature. She
underwent total hip replacement and ORIF on [**2127-5-3**], and
tolerated the procedure well. Post-op, her WBC rose to 17. She
was found to have pansensitive Ecoli UTI. Her Hct also dropped
from low 30s to 26, for which she reportedly received PRBCs (per
dtr). She was getting ready for DC to rehab, when she was noted
to be tachycardic. EKG showed new ST elevations ~2mm in V2-6, I
and aVL. She had no chest pain and no new SOB. She was sent for
a CTA, which was negative PE, though study was slightly limited
by motion. (CTA did, however, show large R pleural effusion,
which is old and has been malignant on prior taps. Also seen was
masslike consolidation of RUL & RML w/ adenopathy). CK was 96,
MB 13, Trop 0.45, INR 1.1, Hct 31. Discussion w/ cardiology at
OSH was had & decision made to transfer pt for cardiac cath b/c
of concern for STEMI. Pt & family agreed to this intervention.
.
In the cardiac cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**], there were no significant
coronary lesions on angio. Notably, her LV-gram showed severe
anterolateral, apical, and inferoapical hypokinesis w/ LVEF 20%.
She had markedly depressed cardiac index (1.8), elevated wedge
(34), and moderate pulm HTN. She was given presumptive dx of
Takotsubo CMP. During the cath, the patient became confused and
agitated. She was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.

Pertinent Results:
OSH CXR: large right pleural effusion and atelectasis, mass

.
CT scan of chest [**5-7**]: large right side pleural effusion, mass
like consolidation in right upper lobe and portion of right mid

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-5-9**] 8:56 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Please eval for SDH or e/o mets.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman with known stage IV lung CA s/p cardiac cath.
Mental status changes.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for SDH or e/o mets.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: contrast w/ cath already
today

HISTORY: 77-year-old female with known stage IV lung cancer
status post cardiac catheterization, now with altered mental
status.

COMPARISON: No prior exam is available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial imaging was performed through the
brain without administration of IV contrast.

CT HEAD: Hypodensity involving right posterior frontal
subcortical white matter along the superior convexity is noted;
while this may represent old ischemic change, no prior imaging
is available to establish stability and this may represent edema
surrounding a metastatic lesion in this patient with known stage
IV lung cancer. Note is made of mild atrophic appearance, which
would be more consistent with old infarct. There may also be a
smaller region of hypodensity along the posterior left frontal
region as well, along the superior convexity.

Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, effacement of
the basal cisterns, or infarction. Punctate, likely extra-axial
densities may represent sequelae from prior myelography versus
vascular calcifications. Mild prominence of the ventricles and
extra- axial CSF spaces is consistent with age-related
involutional change. Vascular calcifications are noted along the
cavernous carotid arteries. Patient is noted to have right lens
replacement. The soft tissues appear unremarkable. No region of
bony destruction is seen in the visualized calvarium. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain well
aerated.

IMPRESSION: Region of hypodensity along the posterior right
frontal lobe along the superior convexity may represent old
infarct, however edema due to underlying mass may also have this
appearance. If no prior study is available to establish
stability, MR would be recommended for further evaluation. Note
is also made of a smaller region of hypodensity along the left
superior convexity. No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:

.
#. Cardiomyopathy: 77yo woman with progressive stage IV NSCLC,
h/o CVA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recent R hip fx s/p
replacement & ORIF who was noted to be in sinus tach at OSH, EKG
showed STE, and cardiac cath was done on arrival which was
notable for absence of significant CAD and presence of
hypokinesis of anterolat/apex/inferoapex with severely depressed
cardiac index, concerning for Takotsubo CMP.  Her EF was found
to be ~20%. There is a broad hypokinesis of broad territory w/o
corresponding CAD with question of Takostubo CMP. Possible
triggers may have been recent hip fx vs. stress of being in
hospital. However unclear if true stress reaction vs possibly
thromboembolic event to coronaries. Pt was started on
Metoprolol, hydralazine and isordil.   She was also placed on
simvastatin 10mg daily and aspirin 325mg.  ACEi were not given
secondary to a history of medication intolerance.  Her
medications were titrated as her BP and HR tolerated for
optimzal management of her cardiomyopathy.  An ECHO was not done
during her hospitilization as her EF was assessed at cath and
her general goals of care were addressed given her late stage
Lung Cancer. In addition anti-coagulation therapy with warfarin
was not started given her known metastatic disease.  A
cardiology appointment will be scheduled for her at [**Hospital1 18**].  If
she does not hear from the cardiology dept by Wed [**6-13**] please
be sure to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9832**] and have one scheduled.

#. CAD: pt does have 50% LMCA lesion on cath.  She was placed on
aspirin 325, simv
