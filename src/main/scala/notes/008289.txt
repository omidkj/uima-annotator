Admission Date:  [**2178-1-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-1-23**]


Service:  CCU

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
man with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.  He
lives alone.  Over the 4-6 weeks prior to admission, the
family noticed the patient was more unsteady on his feet with
frequent falls.  They also noted that he had poor p.o.
intake.  At baseline, patient is wheezy and become short of
breath with exertion.  However, he denies angina or
orthopnea.

On the day of admission, the patient's son found the patient
on the ground.  The family voiced the patient had been there
for approximately 24 hours.  The patient does not recall the
events leading up to his fall.  Upon presentation to the
Emergency Room, the patient was groggy, but responsive.  Of
note, the son noted coffee grounds on his father's clothes.
He also noted slurred speech, but no facial droop.  In the
Emergency Department, the patient denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, or chills.  He denies any new
weakness or numbness.  He does complain of pain in his right
leg.  He denies bright red blood per rectum or melena.

In the Emergency Department, apparently underwent nasogastric
lavage.  This was negative.  Patient was also seen by the GI
service.  He was given 40 mg of Protonix IV as well as 5 mg
of IV Lopressor for his rapid atrial fibrillation.  Central
line placement was attempted in the Emergency Department, but
this was unsuccessful.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. History of falls.
2. Atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion two years
ago.
3. COPD.
4. Status post right knee replacement five years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Percocet.
2. Lasix.
3. Coumadin.
4. Allopurinol.
5. Zestril.
6. Advil.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  He walks with a
cane.  He smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for 35 years,
but quit 25 years ago.  He rarely drinks alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of early coronary artery disease
or stroke in his family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 96.6,
heart rate 99, and blood pressure 154/103, respiratory rate
20, and saturating 95% on 2 liters.  Patient is audibly
wheezy.  His mucous membranes are dry.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  He is anicteric.
There is no jugular venous distention.  There are no carotid
bruits.  Lungs have diffuse expiratory wheezes.  There are no
crackles.  The heart rate is irregular.  There are no
murmurs.  The abdomen is soft and nondistended.  There is
mild epigastric tenderness.  Extremities have evidence of
chronic venous stasis changes.  There is trace bilateral
edema.  The dorsalis pedis pulses are 2+ bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The white count is 11.4 with 87%
neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, hematocrit 46,
platelets 157.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 100,
bicarb 28, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, and glucose of 103, INR
1.5, PT 14.8, PTT 29.3.  CK 3,129, MB 35, troponin 0.05, MB
index 1.1.

EKG shows atrial fibrillation with a rate of 100.  There is
left axis deviation.  There is a right bundle branch block.
There is a question of [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in leads V2-3.
There are no T-wave inversions.

Chest x-ray shows some volume overload.  There is a question
of a left lower lobe opacity.

A CT of the head shows no intracranial hemorrhage.  It shows
chronic sinus disease.

COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL:  Patient was admitted to the Medicine
service.  During his stay on the medicine floor, the patient
had a head laceration sutured.  He also ruled out for
myocardial infarction.  His atrial fibrillation was
controlled on beta blocker.  His Coumadin was held as he was
found to have coffee-ground emesis.  There was no further
evidence of gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was noted to
have intermittent dyspnea, and was started on Solu-Medrol for
possible COPD flare.  He is also placed on levofloxacin and
Flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia.

He occasionally received Lasix for diuresis during his first
few days in hospital.  His creatinine was noted to bump at
this time from 1.1 to 2.4.  Eventually digoxin was added for
rate control of his atrial fibrillation.

On [**2178-1-22**], the patient was noted to have mental
status changes.  His telemetry at that time showed atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in
the 120s to 160s.  The patient was also noted to have
increased respiratory distress with a respiratory rate in the
40s.  His oxygen saturation was 90% on a nonrebreather.
Patient was given diltiazem 10 mg IV 3x with little
improvement.  He was also given Lasix to treat potential CHF
causes of his respiratory distress.

An urgent family meeting was held with the patient's
children.  At this time, the family confirmed that the
patient was DNR/DNI.  However, the family did agree to
transfer the patient to the CCU for possible CPAP as well as
diltiazem drip to control his rate.  At the time of transfer,
the patient's arterial blood gas was 7.43/43/63 on 100%
nonrebreather.

The patient was transferred to the CCU, and was initially
started on CPAP.  Several hours later, he was noted to spike
a temperature and to drop his blood pressure to 80/50.  An
arterial blood gas at that time showed 7.09/113/142 on
positive pressure ventilation.  The family was consulted.
They again iterated that they did not want the patient to be
intubated or shocked for cardioversion.  They stated that
they wished their father's care to center around his comfort.

At that time, CPAP was discontinued.  Patient received
Morphine for comfort.  Patient passed away at 1 p.m. on
[**2178-1-23**].  The patient's family was at his bedside.

DIAGNOSES:
1. Rapid atrial fibrillation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed.
4. Fall.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Congestive heart failure.
7. Probable sepsis.
8. Status post ruled out myocardial infarction.
