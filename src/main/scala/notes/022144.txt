Service:  CT Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male with a history of depression, bursitis and
hypercholesterolemia, who began noticing exertional dyspnea
approximately three months ago.  At that time, he had had an
echocardiogram that showed a flail posterior segment of the
mitral valve as well as severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient had a preoperative evaluation that included a
cardiac catheterization showing normal coronary arteries.  He
had a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately
50%, a wedge pressure of 26 and a pulmonary artery pressure
of 53/31.  Given the patient's symptoms and severity of the
flail segment, he was therefore slated a quadrangular
resection of the posterior leaflet valve and repair with
annuloplasty.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative laboratory values were notable
for a white blood cell count of 7, hematocrit 43, BUN and
creatinine 20 and 0.9 and normal liver function tests.  A
chest x-ray was negative for any acute cardiopulmonary
process.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2166-10-20**], where he underwent elective repair of
his valve.  Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] repaired the valve using a
quadrangular resection and a #28 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] ring was
utilized for the annuloplasty.  The patient was noted to have
good biventricular function postoperatively by transthoracic
echocardiogram as well as only a small trace of mitral
regurgitation with the new valve.

The patient was transferred to the CSRU, where he was quickly
extubated on the night of surgery.  He was maintained on
pressors until the following day of surgery, at which time
they are weaned.  His cardiovascular status quickly
stabilized.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
number one on a beta blocker, aspirin and antihyperlipidemic
[**Doctor Last Name 360**].  He was started with physical therapy and a normal
diet was instituted.  He was out of bed ambulating and, by
day number two, he was level three out of five.

By postoperative day number four, the patient was noted to be
ambulating freely without assistance.  His pain was well
controlled.  He was tolerating his diet.  He had already had
a bowel movement.  Chest tubes and Foley catheter had already
been removed on postoperative days one and two respectively.
A chest x-ray status post discontinuation of chest tubes
showed no evidence of pneumothorax, well expanded lungs, some
basilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.

Laboratory data on discharge were notable for a white blood
cell count of 9, hematocrit 22, platelet count 115,000,
potassium 4.6, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9, calcium 8.1, magnesium
2 and phosphorous 2.7.

The patient was started on a low dose ACE inhibitor
postoperatively as well, on postoperative day number two.
This was held for persistently labile blood pressure.  He was
weaned off the epicardial pacing leads and, by postoperative
day number four, he continued to do well.

On [**2166-10-24**], the patient was deemed appropriate for
discharge and was sent home.  On discharge physical
examination, he was in no acute distress.  He was afebrile
with a maximum temperature of 98.5, blood pressure 117/60,
pulse 80s to 90s, he was atrially paced at that time, and
fingerstick was 132.  His wound sites were clean, dry and
intact without erythema or exudate.  He had a stable sternum
with staples in place.  His lungs were clear except for
decreased sounds at the left base, no crackles.  Abdomen was
benign.  Lower extremities were warm and well perfused with
palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses
bilaterally.  The patient was ambulating with a cane.
Physical therapy stated he was appropriate for discharge.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]P:  The patient will have follow-up in the [**Hospital 409**]
Clinic at [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in
one week from the time of discharge.  The patient will follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in one month.  He will see his
cardiologist in two to four weeks.
