HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft and myocardial infarction in
[**2114**] with a negative stress echocardiogram in [**2126-5-9**], with an ejection fraction of 31%, who presented to
[**Location (un) **] [**Hospital6 2910**] on [**5-2**] with increasing
shortness of breath and found to be in congestive heart
failure with BNP of 3700.  Also, his dig level was 2.3.  The
patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  CKs were
negative times three.  The patient had diagnostic
catheterization planned.

A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed with a PA pressure of 92/40,
cardiac output of 2.0, [**Female First Name (un) **] of 2800.

The patient had a cardiac catheterization performed on [**5-3**]
which showed severe native three vessel disease, saphenous
vein graft to left circumflex was occluded, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal 1 was occluded, saphenous vein graft
to PDA with distal 95% stenosis; severe plus four mitral
regurgitation, ejection fraction of 15 to 20%.

The patient was started on Dobutamine and Natrecor, heparin
drip and intravenous Lasix with good diuresis.  Creatinine
improved from 1.8 to 1.4.  His digoxin was held and the
patient had occasional complete heart block which resolved at
the time of transfer.  His last PA numbers were 60/30,
cardiac output of 2.3, [**Female First Name (un) **] of 2200.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization with
pre-cath hydration and Mucomyst.

He is currently comfortable with no shortness of breath, no
chest pain, no right groin pain.

about 6 cm and 45 degrees.  No lymphadenopathy.  Chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac is S1, S2, II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the apex.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities with right
groin with femoral line.  Distal pulses were Doppler-able but
depressed.  Extremities were warm.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 13.2,
hematocrit 39.4, platelets 154.  Sodium 135, potassium 3.8,
chloride 95, bicarbonate 32, BUN 30, creatinine 1.5, glucose

EKG is normal sinus rhythm, PR of greater than 240, left axis
deviation with QRS of 120; left bundle branch block.  J-point
in V1 through V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 76 year old gentleman with
ischemia cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction of 10 to 15%,
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2114**], admitted to
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**5-2**] with congestive
heart failure, Swan-Ganz catheter with cardiogenic shock
treated with dobutamine, nesiritide and Lasix.

Catheterization revealed two out of three grafts occluded and
was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
intervention.

1.  ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY:  The patient initially was
admitted for a cardiac catheterization and stent which he
underwent the following morning.  He tolerated the procedure
well and had stents placed.  He was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, statin and eventually was weaned off the heparin and
Nitroglycerin drip and tolerated this well.  Ejection
fraction of 10 to 15%. Admitted in heart failure.

Attempted diuresis was eventually weaned off of the
Dobutamine and Natrecor while at cardiac catheterization and
this was discontinued at that time. The patient was otherwise
euvolemic.  The next day, his Swan-Ganz catheter was pulled
later that afternoon.  The patient was transferred to the
floor.  Eventually the next morning, he was restarted on his
home regimen of 80 Lasix q. day and Aldactone was added.

The patient was started on Carvedilol and an ACE inhibitor
upon transfer.  Eventually, the patient had an episode of
hypotension and bradycardia and was temporarily on Dopamine
and pressors which were weaned off and the patient's blood
pressure was supported with hydration.  Etiology of the
patient's hypotension was unclear, whether secondary to over
anti-hypertensives or over diuresis.  The patient was given
an intravenous fluid bolus and started on low dose dopamine.
The patient had a STAT chest x-ray and KUB done which were
otherwise normal.

The patient's blood pressure came up on dopamine and so did
his heart rate eventually.  He was weaned off the Dopamine
and his blood pressure was supported with hydration.  The
patient's blood pressure remained relatively stable with
p.r.n. fluid boluses.  The patient did not have any further
episodes of bradycardia after the episode on the 31st in the
evening.

2.  ELEVATED LIVER FUNCTION TESTS AND INR:  The patient
likely had shock liver after his hypotensive episode and had
rising liver function tests and INR secondary to
hypo-perfusion of his liver.  The patient's liver function
tests and INR coagulopathy was followed closely but the
patient was not improving and did have slight right upper
quadrant tenderness.  Discussed plans with family and as they
would not prefer further intervention, ultrasound was not
indicated and antibiotics were discontinued.

3.  ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's creatinine
was rising during the course of the day, likely prerenal and
dehydrated per his FeNa and also may have had symptoms of ATN
from his episode of hypotension.  The patient's creatinine
was rising and plateaued around 2.6.  The patient was
hyperkalemic without EKG changes and the patient and family
refused Kayexalate dosing which was not pushed secondary to
lack of EKG changes.

4.  PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE:  The patient on cardiac
catheterization was found to have claudication of his right
superficial femoral artery.  The patient had diminished but
Doppler-able posterior tibial pulses on the right and
palpable pulses on the left.  Otherwise, was stable from this
and the patient did not have further episodes of leg pain
except during his cardiac catheterization.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was continued on sliding
scale insulin.  His Glyburide was held for his
catheterization.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Fair.  The patient and family wants
to take patient home to be comfortable.  The patient's goal
at this point is comfort and refusing further invasive tests
and monitoring.  The plan is to send the patient home with
Hospice care which is being arranged at present.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Cardiogenic shock.
3.  Hypotension.
4.  Shock liver.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Acute on chronic renal failure.
8.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Morphine sulfate 10 mg p.o. p.r.n.
2.  Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. p.r.n.

The rest of the medications are per Hospice.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Discharge follow-up is per Hospice.
