History of Present Illness:
84 male with heavy EtOH consumption, hypothyroidism and dementia
was admitted to an OSH on [**2152-4-27**] with 2-3 days of generalized
weakness and epigastric discomfort. In their ED, he had melena
and hematocrit of 21.4. His was markedly hypovolemic with Cr of
1.8, BUN 88, SBP 95, HR:80. He never had gross bleeding but his
Hct failed to improve with transfusion. During his admission
there, he was transfused 12U PRBC and 4U FFP. He underwent an
EGD twice, both times revealing large duodenal ulcer with
overlying clot; intervention was not possible as the endoscopist
found it difficult to keep the scope in the duodenum. On
admission, [**4-27**], he was noted to be in NSR but ECG dated [**4-28**]
shows him in atrial fibrillation. On the AM of transfer, he was
noted to be mottled and cold, clammy with HR in the 150s, BPs
160/110, tachypnic and with sats in the 70s. There was concern
for volume overload due to multiple transfusions vs. aspiration
pneumonia. He was intubated and given propofol for sedation; his
BP dropped perhaps due to positive pressure ventilation vs.
propofol. He was given neosynephrine for hypotension. He spiked
a fever to 103.3. Tanish secretions were noted coming from ETT.
He was placed on Zosyn but when PCN allergy was detected, he was
changed to levofloxacin. An OG tube was placed with drainage of
400 cc of greenish-brown material. His left AC IV was noted to
be erythematous (?reaction to levaquin). He was given benadryl
and the levaquin was discontinued. There was a long discussion
with the patient's wife (his healthcare proxy) about his goal of
care. She "wanted to do everything possible to save his life."
His friends, who came to visit, however, stated that "Mr.
[**Name14 (STitle) 66617**] did not wish to have heroics done or any invasive
procedures." It was their impression that the patient's wife was
somewhat demented. The team decided to respect the wife's
statements as the patient's goals given that she is his proxy.
As his neo was being infused through a peripheral IV, a right IJ
was placed by the surgical service under sterile conditions. He
was transferred to the MICU on [**2152-5-2**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for management of
GI Bleed and shock.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, the right IJ was removed (based on the new
[**Hospital1 18**] line policy that requires all lines placed at outside
hospitals to be removed), and a left subclavian line was placed.
He was extubated as his oxygenation and ventilation were normal.
His neo was weaned off. GI was consulted to evaluate him. It was
their impression that since his Hct was stable and he was known
not to have varices that they would not perform another EGD
here. They recommended [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI and vitamin K to reverse his
Vitamin K deficiency (likely nutritional). The patient's WBC
count on admission was 21 with 14% bands. He was placed on
ceftriaxone, vanco and flagyl empirically. The bandemia rose to
24% on [**2152-5-3**]. He remained hemodynamically stable
post-extubation, afebrile with lactate of 1.6. Cortisol level of
20. All blood cultures were negative, with the exception of a
sputum culture from [**5-2**] which grew gram negative rods. A TTE was
performed on [**5-3**] given the patient's afib, low voltage and
transient hypotension. The LVEF was 55%, 1+MR/1+AR, LA was
dilated. Trivial effusion. His Hct remained stable for 24 hours
and was 28 on the day of transfer ([**5-5**]).


FLOOR COURSE [**5-5**] -> TODAY
Upon transfer, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29286**] from social work was consulted
regarding confusion with code status. It was determined that the
patient's wife was stated that his wanted all measures because
she was "terrified that her husband would not come home to take
care of her." Patient also confirmed that he wished to remain
full code and have cardioversion and be reintubated if need
arose as he would always look forward to seeing his wife again.
Upon arrival to the floor patient has no specific complaints and
is very stoic. He is unclear of why he is in the hospital but he
does know he is in [**Hospital3 **]. Alert to place, month and name.
Remmembers family phone members, no long term memory deficits.
.
ROS: he DENIED any fever, chills, no n/v, no dysphagia, sore
throat, no chest discomfort, dyspnea, no cough, he even equates
his breathing close to his baseline, no ABD pain, no dysuria, no
myalgias/arthralgias
