Lower Extremity Weakness

History of Present Illness:
This is a 23 year old female transgender to male, mild CP,
neurogenic bladder, in a wheelchair at times at baseline, with
HIV (CD4-308) and HCV with recent GBS bacteremia admitted
[**2197-4-20**] presents to the ED with headache.  Patient had been
treated with IV ceftriaxone, which was dicontinued on the 4th of
this month (course was supossed to be finished [**5-13**]).  Patient
had L-side PICC with erythema and pain in site and therefore was
pulled.  Patient had return of N/V/D, headache, and weakness two
days after stopping IV antibiotics.  The patient had a fever to
100.5 at home, nausea, diarrhea and new back pain.  The patient
reports the lower back pain started the morning of admission.
He also reports new worsening of lower extremity weakness as
well as worsening dysethesia of the right lower extremity.
.
In the ED, initial vs were 98.6 104 136/70 20 99.  Exam with
supra-spinal tenderness in L2-L3, normal sphincter tone, normal
straight-leg-raise. No papilledema. CN 2-12 intact, normal
sensation to touch in chest abdomen and lower extremities.  Labs
in the ED were unremarkable including lactate of 1.2.  Blood
cultures x2 were sent, however not pending.  An MRI of the T and
L spine without DWI images revealed no evidence of epidural
abscess.  The patient was given ceftriaxone to empirically treat
his prior bacteremia.  The patient was called out to the
medicine floor, then had episode of SVT to 160s, got agitated,
thought was going to require intubation.  The team attempted
vagal maneuver, BP down to 70s.  Blood pressure returned to
baseline without intervention.  Received dilaudid, lorazepam and
versed for pain and agitation, as well as 1L IV fluids.  The
patient got a CTA to evaluate for PE, which was negative, but
showed evidence of new infiltrate.  On transfer VS were 98.2 120
-145 132/55 16 99% on RA, dropped to 92% on RA.  Prior to
transfer the patient's temp increased to 101.7 in the ED.
.
In the MICU, the patient continues to complain of headache and
back pain.  He is intermittently somnolent, but reports did not
sleep well overnight.  The patient reports decreased sensation
of his right leg and weakness of bilateral lower extremities.
The patient does have a history of CP and requires a wheelchair
at times, but reports this is worse than baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
23 year old female to male transgendered patient with a history
of HIV, Hepatitis C, and recent admission for GBS bacteremia
incompletely treated presents with HA, NVD, back pain and
worsening lower extremity weakness.
.
MICU Course- Patient admitted to the MICU after becoming
tachycardic to 160 and transiently dropping BP to the 70s.
Pressure normalized without intervention but he remained
tachycardic to 120s on admission to the floor.  While here, he
received 4.5 L of IV fluids (NS and D5-1/2NS) and did well.
Tachycardia resolved overnight and he remained hemodynamically
stable the next day.  Regarding his weakness, it seemed to be
related to his CP and not to an CNS infection as imaging was
negative for any acute infectious process.  Given the low
likelihood for meningitis, an LP was deferred.  He was treated
empirically with vancomycin/cefepime/azithromycin.  ID team
followed.  Given that he was stable, he was called out to the
floor on [**2197-5-15**].
.
.# Fever:  Likely related to UTI and new LLL infiltrate (suspect
CAP).  No signs of intraabdominal or pelvic process. The patient
was maintained on vanc/cefepime/azithro for several days then
switched to augmentin and azithromycin for a 7 day total course
per ID recomendatoins.  His fevers resolved as soon as he hit
the floor.  CTA did show new LLL infiltrate compared to films
from [**2197-4-1**].
.
# Back Pain/lower extremity weakness:  Improved throughout his
stay.  MRI did not show any acute process.  Serum RPR was
non-reactive.  LP showed no sign of transverse myelitis.
Neurology felt that this would be an exacerbation of his
underlying CP in the setting of acute illness. He was discharged
to rehab, to help regain his lower extermity strength.
.
.
# Headache:  The patient has migraines at baseline, but this
headache is different from baseline.  The patient has had recent
workup for similar symptoms with head CT and LP in [**4-10**] which
did not reveal etiology.  This resolved with the treatment of
his PNA.

# Tachycardia:  Resolved with IV fluids.  Now in sinus rhythm
with a rate of 81.  BP also within normal limits.  Most likely
secondary to fever, pain, infection and dehydration.  Improving
with IV fluids.  Pt denies chest pain, palpitations, shortness
of breath.  Will monitor on t
