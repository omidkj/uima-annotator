Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2123-7-22**] AVR(21 [**Doctor Last Name **] Pericardial)/Septal myomectomy


History of Present Illness:
62 year old female with known bicuspid aortic valve and
aortic stenosis. She has a history of a coarctation of the aorta
repair by way of an end to end anastomosis at the age of 12.
Over
the past couple years, she has been followed by serial
echocardiograms which have shown progression of her aortic
stenosis. Over the last 6 months, she has noted mild dyspnea on
exertion. She denies chest pain, syncope, pre-syncope,
orthopnea,
PND and pedal edema. Given her most recent echocardiogram
findings, she has been referred for cardiac surgical evaluation.

Final Report:  In comparison with the study of [**7-24**], there is
continued
opacification in the retrocardiac region and obscuring the
costophrenic sulcus on the left.  Again, this is consistent with
pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the left lower
lobe.  A small apical pneumothorax on the right is again seen.
IMPRESSION:  Little overall change.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary veins not identified.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD or PFO
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity
size. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.
AORTIC VALVE: Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB:
1. Preserved biventricular systolci function
2. Bioproshtetic valve in aortic position. Well seated and good
leaflet excursion.
3. No AI, Peak Gradient = 30 mm Hg,
4. Intact aorta and no other change

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted one day prior to scheduled surgery for
cardiac catheterization. the catheterization revealed: no
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
She was brought to the operating room on [**7-22**] for planned heart
suregry, please see operative report for details in summary she
had: Aortic Valve Replacement with 21 [**Doctor Last Name **] Pericardial and
Septal myomectomy. Her bypass time was 63 minutes with a
crossclamp time of 49 minutes. She tolerated the operation well
and post operatively was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU
in stable condition. She remained stable in the immedicate
post-op period and within hours of leaving the OR woke
neurologically intact was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated. She weaned off all pressors over the next 12 hours
and on POD1 was
