Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Patient to undergo elective right and left heart
catheterization; admitted to neurology after suffering stroke.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left heart catheterization, through cordis, femoral, right groin
Intubation
Cerebral angiography
MERCI procedure with administration of intraarterial TPA

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10733**] is a 75-year-old man with CAD, s/p MI ([**2163**]) x 2, s/p
CABG ([**2163**], 4v), s/p PCI ([**2167**]), now with recurrent angina,
borderline stress test, who presented for elective right and
left
heart catheterization today. In the cath. lab he developed
right-sided weakness, dysathria then aphasia.

***

Patient speaks and ambulates at baseline, came for elective
cath.
today and was in lab at 8:30 a.m. Patient given 4000 U heparins,
600 mg Plavix, 150 mcg fentanyl and 0.5 of Versed. procedure was
going well and 80 % LAD, long stenosis found. Patient reported
[**4-7**] pain at 10:35, but when asked again at 10:40, was aphasic.
Code stroke was called and we arrived at 10:43. Patient was
hypotensive at appearance of symptoms on nitro drip, which was
stopped when dysarthria was noted. Upon initially evaluation he
was deeply dysarthric and rapidly developed global aphasia with
right sided weakness of leg and arm, leading to NIHSS of 19. Leg
movement reappeared. The patient was transferred to the cerebral
angio. lab for intervention by agreement of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **].

The patient was intubated, induced with propofol. Cerebral
angiography revealed M1 occlusion, MERCI was performed followed
by intraarterial TPA into M2 superior and inferior segments.
After this, right arm movement was present. The patient was
admitted to the TSICU.

Recent notable medical history includes worsening angina, even
in
the presence of Imdur. Bumex was also recently started. Failure
of medical management led to his agreement with cardiac cath.

It the TSICU, the patient was again noted to have flaccid
paralysis of his right arm.

Review of systems was not possible at admission to TSICU.

[**2179-10-8**] Imaging:
BRAIN MRI:

Acute infarct is identified in the left middle cerebral artery
territory as
well as in the left medial frontal lobe in the anterior cerebral
artery
territory. Several small foci of restricted diffusion are also
seen in the
left posterior temporal and occipital regions. On susceptibility
images, a
focus of susceptibility is seen in the left sylvian region which
could be due
to a clot within the middle cerebral artery. However, this is
not apparent on
the MRA examination. Several small foci of chronic
microhemorrhages are seen
in the left frontal lobe and right parietal lobe. There is no
midline shift
or hydrocephalus. There is moderate brain atrophy seen. There
are soft
tissue changes in the right maxillary sinus.

MRA HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates flow signal in the left middle
cerebral artery which
is considerably improved since the CTA examination. There is a
slight
protuberance in the region of left anterior communicating artery
near its
junction with the left A2 segment which could be due to a small
aneurysm but
correlation with conventional angiographic findings recommended.
Otherwise,
no abnormalities on MRA of the head.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarcts in the distribution of left middle cerebral
artery and left
anterior cerebral artery with some foci in the left posterior
temporal region
in the watershed distribution with left MCA and PCA.
2. Small focus of susceptibility in the left sylvian fissure
region could be
due to partial thrombus within the left middle cerebral artery,
but flow
signal is continuously visualized on the MRA, however.
3. Several small foci of chronic microhemorrhages in other parts
of the brain
as described above.
4. MRA shows flow signal in the left middle cerebral artery
which has
improved since the conventional angiography of [**2179-10-8**].
5. Subtle protuberance in the region of anterior communicating
artery could
be due to a small aneurysm or tortuous vascular structure.
Correlation with
conventional angiographic findings recommended.

[**2179-10-18**]: NCHCT:
IMPRESSION: Since the previous study, there has been no
significant interval
change. No evidence of change in edema or new hemorrhage
identified at the
site of infarct in the left frontal lobe as well as continued
evolution of the
subarachnoid hemorrhage.



Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course

Intubation, Sedation
Patient came to TSICU intubated and required some propofol for
imaging studies (MRI in particular).

Myocardial Injury and Cardiomyopathy
Troponin leak post-catheterization as expected with ST elevation
on telemetry without dramatic correlate on formal EKG. Last LVEF
was 40 %. Patient is on ACE, BB at home. Doses reduced to
maintain blood pressure at goal of 100 to 140 systolic.

Neurologic Injury
Patient sustained partial MCA territory after likely clot
breakup following MERC
