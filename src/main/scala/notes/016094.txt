History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] is a 72-year-old gentleman with h/o renal transplant
in [**2104**] with a 90 pack-year smoking history recently diagnosed
with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung (by
resection of PET positive left upper lobe nodule with no
evidence of disease dissemination) who was discharged on [**1-24**]
after being admitted for a bronchoscopy, left video thoracoscopy
with biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes, and video-assisted wedge
resection of an upper lobe nodule which he tolerated well. He
has been feeling nauseated art home since discharge and has also
experienced anorexia, lethergy, lightheadedness. Of note, he has
not taken insulin at home x 2 days. At time of discharge on
[**1-24**], he had a rising WBC at 12.5.
.
This gentleman has significant comorbidities including
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, increased
serum cholesterol, coronary artery disease status post prior
myocardial infarction and severe peripheral vascular disease
with bilateral lower extremity revascularizations. He recently
underwent a revision of this right femoral posterior tibial
graft when this lesion was detected. The patient has a
90-pack-year smoking history, having quit in [**2083**]. He has no new
pulmonary symptoms. He also has crippling arthritis that has
left him wheelchair bound. A preoperative evaluation showed no
critical coronary disease and preserved ventricular function.
.
In the ED, he was found to be in DKA with a gap of 18. In
addition, he had a UTI with 21-50 WBCs, Many bacteria, Mod
Leuks, 15 Ketones, 1000 glucose, 0-2 EPIs. His WBCs were 20 on
CBC with a HCT of 30 (last HCT 33 on [**1-20**]). CXR was unchanged
from prior on [**1-20**]. He received 400mg Cipro IV, 1g Vancomycin
and Insulin gtt with Calcium Gluconate. A renal ultrasound was
done and showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. Renal transplant
and CT [**Doctor First Name **] saw the pt in the ED. He received a total of 1L of
fluids. Prior to coming up, the patient had respiratory
compromise requiring Bipap thought secondary to acute pulmonary
edema.

Imaging:
[**2112-2-1**] - Ultrasound of renal transplant.

INDICATION: Difficulty voiding.
FINDINGS: The transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant is
visualized and measures 11.6 cm in maximum length. There is
normal renal cortical thickness. The resistive index measures
approximately 0.8. No evidence of any perinephric collections.
The bladder measures 7.9 cm in transverse x 7.5 cm in AP x 9 cm,
pre-voiding and is relatively unchanged post-voiding and
measures approximately 9 x 7 x 8.6 cm, representing a bladder
volume post-micturition of 334 mL.

IMPRESSION: Transplant kidney in left lower quadrant relatively
unremarkable with significant post-micturition residual volume
of 334 mL.

[**2112-1-27**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated athe sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-12-15**],
no change.


Brief Hospital Course:
72yo man with multiple medical problems including renal
transplant, DM, severe PVD, CAD, recent dx of lung CA who p/w
DKA & klebsiella. Now, stable.
.
#Klebsiella Urosepsis: on admission, pt found to have
pan-sensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (2/4 bottles).  His UA
was also positive, though urine culture was negative.  He
receieved ciprofloxacin for the infection.  It was felt his
urine was the source of the bacteremia.  Surveillance blood
cultures cleared following initiation of anti-biotics.
.
# DKA: Pt was admitted to the MICU, where he was started on an
insulin drip and fluids for DKA.  The trigger for his DKA was
thought to be his infection along with his non-compliance with
insulin during the days prior to admission.  Once his gap
closed, he was transferred to the medicine [**Hospital1 **].  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted. They recommended changing his lantus to NPH and
tightening his sliding scale.  His blood sugars came under
better control with this regimen.
.
# ARF: Pt had acute renal failure on admission that was thought
to be due to pre-renal etiology in setting of DKA.  There was no
evidence of pyelonephritis, nor hydronephrosis.  Creatinine
peaked at 3.2 and improved with fluid
