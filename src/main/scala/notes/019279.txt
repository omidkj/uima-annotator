Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from Neurosurgery service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for management
of right basal ganglia hemorrhage with intraventricular
extension, s/p EVD placement


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2171-8-15**]: R EVD placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 yo F with h/o poorly-controlled HTN, HLD,
ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG x4 who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] ED with headache, vomiting, altered mental status and
elevated BPs at home (300mmHg systolic per records). She was
taken to her nephrologist's office where she was found to be
hypertensive. Nitropaste was applied to her chest and she was
given clonidine (of note, has h/o lethargy with clonidine). She
was then transferred by car to [**Hospital3 **] where she was
found to have SBP >190 (for which she received 20 mg IV
Labetolol), lethargic and difficult to arouse. CT head showed
right likely caudate hemorrhage with IVH to right lateral
ventricle as well as extending into 3rd and 4th ventricles. She
was subsequently intubated and received 25g Mannitol. Right
femoral line was placed. Right IJ was attempted but was
misplaced in subclavian vein, also resulted in apical
pneumothorax. She was noted to have old, chronic abdominal
distension (baseline per family). She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.

Her initial exam here (on Propofol)revealed PERRLA 2mm and
moving right leg. She received another 50g of Mannitol, was
started on nicardipine drip for blood pressure control, as well
as transfused 1 unit platelet. She had right EVD placed in the
ED, and transferred to T-SICU.

General ROS (obtained from notes): Last HD yesterday. Prior to
intubation, patient states she was compliant with all her
medications. Right IJ placement was attempted but ended in
subclavian vein. It was subsequently removed with apical
pneumothorax on OSH CXR. A right femoral central line was
placed.
She has abdominal distension that is old, and chronic
constipation.

Studies:

EEG ([**8-16**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of focal slowing with increased amplitude and
accentuation of faster frequencies over the left central region,
consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction and breach artifact.
There is mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm. These findings are indicative of mild to moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific. No electrographic seizures are present.

EEG ([**8-17**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of focal slowing with increased amplitude and
accentuation of faster frequencies over the left central region,
consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction and breach artifact.
There is mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm. These findings are indicative of mild to moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific. No electrographic seizures are present. Compared to
the prior day's study, there is no significant change.

NCHCT ([**8-17**]):  No significant change since prior study, stable
right caudate and intraventricular bleed.

CXR ([**8-16**]): There is no evident pneumothorax. Moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube tip is in the right main stem
bronchus.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There
is mild vascular congestion. Sternal wires are aligned.

NCHCT ([**8-16**]):
1. Slight increase of the right intraparenchymal hemorrhage at
the right
caudate head with overlying edema, with possible redistribution
in the
subarachnoid region at the right frontoparietal area.  No
evidence of
worsening mass effect or central herniation.  No evidence of
acute infarction or new hemorrhage.
2. No change in ventricular size suggestive of obstructive
hydrocephalus.

NCHCT ([**8-18**]): No interval change in right intraparenchymal
caudate hemorrhage. Continued evolution of blood products in the
lateral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces. No new area of
hemorrhage.

NCHCT ([**8-22**]):
1. Stable right caudate parenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Stable position of right frontal approach EVD without
hydrocephalus.
Resolved pneumocephalus.

NCHCT ([**8-25**]): No significant change in right caudate
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. No new hemorrhage or mass effect. Interval removal
of right
frontal approach EVD.

ARTERIAL DUPLEX UPPER EXTREMITY

FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both subclavian
arteries.  The waveforms and velocities are normal.  There is no
evidence of pseudoaneurysm or aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal duplex of the subclavian arteries.  Of note,
the whole subclavian artery cannot be evaluated via ultrasound
but in the area of concern, there were no abnormal findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F with h/o HTN, CAD, ESRD on HD who presented on [**8-15**] to
OSH ED with HA, N/V and found to have right caudate hemorrhage
with intraventricular extension, likely hypertensive in
etiology.

# NEURO: Patient was intubated at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
Neurosurgery service for further management. In the TSICU she
received 75g IV mannitol. Her BP was controlled with Labetalol
and started on Nicardepime gtt. Right EVD was placed for
drainage of IVH. A CT was performed in the AM [**8-16**] which was
stable. On [**8-16**] her care was transferred to the Neurology
service. She was noted to have rhythymic twitching of her right
hand on initial evaluation so she was started on Keppra for
seizure prophylaxis (risk given EVD placement). Serial EEGs
showed no electrographic seizures.
