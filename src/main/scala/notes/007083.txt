Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21193**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 37430**] is an 80-year-old man with a meningioma, presenting
with seizure in [**Month (only) 116**], undergoing recent resection, presenting
with
delirium and probable seizure.

The patient is delirious (see below) and mostly only answers yes
or no. History was obtained from his daughter, [**Name (NI) **].

In [**Month (only) **] last year, Mr. [**Known lastname 37430**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] on the floor, amnestic
to antecedent events. He went to an ED where NCHCT showed a left
frontal meningioma. He then left AMA without antiepileptic
drugs.

On [**2119-4-27**], he had another seizure and presented to an outside
hospital before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. While undergoing MRI at
[**Hospital1 18**],
the patient had another seizure (see NSurg note - further
details
not now available). He was also noted to have a new right facial
droop and aphasia. This was attributed to his meningioma and led
to resected on [**2119-5-5**]. Dilantin and Keppra were started.
Surgery
went well and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation.

For the last two days at Rehab. he has been more confused than
baseline. It appears that delirium has been present throughout,
but worsened, perhaps due to numerous room changes - five his
daughter says. [**Name2 (NI) **] has been "walking the halls at night". He has
been refusing medications while there, and even his daughter was
not able to get him to take any of his medications for the last
two days. This included Keppra, Dilantin, Coumadin, then
Pradaxa.
Pradaxa was started on the morning of [**2119-5-24**] and Coumadin
stopped. He has been on SC heparin throughout.

Last night he seemed "altered", more confused, along with having
a "low-grade temperature". He was taken to an OSH and Dilantin
level was found to be very low. CXR, head CT, UA were found to
be
normal, per his daughter. After reloading Dilantin, he was
returned to rehab.

This morning he was found to be unresponsive. When his daughter
arrived at rehab., he was also on a stretcher being prepared to
be returned to [**Hospital1 18**]. He did not make eye contact or respond,
despite open eyes. She thought that his right facial droop is
worse. She did not obtain a description of events earlier that
morning, so it is unclear if he had a convulsive seizure. On
arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], he received IV Ativan 2 mg after which time he
became more interactive, answering yes or no appropriately. The
ED staff were concerned for non-convulsive status and consulted
neurology. He was given Dilantin 1g in the ED. Given suspicion
of
a AAA, CT abdomen was performed without aneurysm noted.

He had been previously independent until the events of [**Month (only) 116**]. He
was still working as a plummer, did daily exercises, watched his
weight and diet and took vitamins, his daughter says. [**Name2 (NI) **]
independent of all ADL's. At baseline he is willful.


Past Medical History:
atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma

Social History:
The patient is widowed and lives alone. He is retired. He has
two healthy
children. He had seven siblings, three of them died at ages
73,75, and 79. He never smoked.  Prior plumber, worked until one
month ago. Prior heavy smoking,
stopped in [**2077**]'s. No alcohol or drugs.


Family History:
No known family history of meningioma, nor seizure. HTN and
prostate cancer in family. Daughter with ruptured cerebral
aneurysm and another that is being followed, no other family
history of this or renal disease, but daughter has been told
that
this is likely hereditary.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neurology:  Mr. [**Known lastname 37430**] was admitted initially to the ICU
initially because of concern for altered mental status.  He
initially was responsive to sternal rub, but later became
febrile and unresponsive with Cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.  He was
started on IV antibiotics and acyclovir and underwent an LP,
which showed a white blood count of 26, red blood cells 2,
lymphocytes 97%, protein 42, and glucose 86.  His cultures have
been negative.  It is likely that the leukocytosis demonstrated
in his CSF was likely secondary to his lumbar puncture.

He underwent a head CT that showed decrease in his left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  He had a CT of his abdomen to r/o
AAA because of concern for abdominal pain that was negative.

During his admission, his Keppra dose was initially doubled to
1000mg [**Hospital1 **] because of concern for ongoing seizure activity.
However, after it was clear that his EEG showed no ongoing
seizure activity, it was weaned to 500mg [**Hospital1 **] again.  Over the
next day, he was transferred back to the neurology floor.
Because he appeared to be more alert with the decreased dose of
keppra, it was thought that it was contributing to his
somnolence.  Therefore, it was eventually weaned off.  His
phenytoin was increased during this time to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  His
corrected phenytoin levels wer
