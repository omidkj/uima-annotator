Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IP stent placement [**2101-11-28**] distal trachea and L mainstem
IP stent placement [**2101-11-30**] R mainstem

History of Present Illness:
68F with PMH of small-cell lung CA diagnosed 3yrs ago s/p chemo
and XRT, also with COPD, who presents s/p scheduled IP
procedure.  Initial symptoms were worsening shortness of breath.
CT showed large mediastinal mass with compression and left upper
and lower lobe occlusion; patient taken to IP for attempted
stenting. The procedure long and complicated due to extensive
tumor burden and narrowing of distal trachea with occlusion of
both main-stems.  IP was unable to place a Y-stent but placed a
metal stent in the distal trachea and a 12mm stent in the left
mainstem with subsequent visualization of the left lower
airways.

VS in the PACU prior to transfer: 97.7 113/49 94 18 96% on 3L.

On the floor, she feels short of breath and wheezy, worse
compared to prior to the procedure.  She has a new cough with
brown sputum production.  She has no other complaints.

[**2101-11-28**] CXR:
A radiopaque stent is visible in the lower trachea and the left
main bronchus. There is subtotal collapse of the left lung with
complete
opacification of the left hemithorax. At the right lung base,
mild-to-moderate parenchymal opacities suggesting chronic
aspiration are seen. These findings were also depicted on the CT
examination from [**2101-11-9**].

[**2101-11-29**] CT Trachea:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of tracheal left bronchus stents. The
stents are
patent.
2. Increased narrowing of the trachea inferior to the tracheal
stent to 5mm in AP dimension, which further narrows to 1.5 mm in
AP dimension with
expiration.
3. Patent left bronchus stent. However, at the carina, the
airway has
narrowed in AP dimension, now measuring 2 mm on inspiration and
1 mm with
expiration.
4. Improved aeration of the left lung with persistent opacities
consistent with infection and/or radiation change.
5. New right basilar opacities consistent with infection and/or
aspiration.
6. Fluid in the esophagus, placing the patient at risk for
aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo female with a history of COPD and small cell lung cancer
s/p chemo and XRT who was admitted on [**11-28**] for a scheduled
placement of a tracheal stent complicated by migration of the
tracheal stent and repeat IP procedure with creation of a
piece-meal Y stent now stable and being called out of the MICU.

# Small cell lung cancer:  The patient had a CT on [**11-24**] showing
compression of the distal trachea and was admitted for
monitoring after her initial bronchoscopy where she had tracheal
and left mainstem stents placed.  The initial proecedure was
complicated by migration of the tracheal stent and repeat IP
procedure (rigid bronchoscopy) with creation of a piecemeal Y
stent.  She had hypoxia after the procedure which has stabilized
with diuresis and with her sedation wearing off.   She was
watched overnight in the MICU and remained stable. She did not
desaturate and was breathing comfortably. The next day on [**12-1**]
she was called back out to the floor.  Since her inital
procedure she was given acetylcysteine 20% nebs [**Hospital1 **] and
guafenesin 1200 mg po bid to keep her secretions mobile.  She
will follow up with IP in approximately 4 weeks.

# Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to underlying COPD and lung
collapse from compression of her trachea.  Patient was found to
desat to the 80's with ambulation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was maintained
on [**1-13**] L NC of continuous oxygen and home oxgyen was set up for
her upon discharge.

# COPD: She was continued on her home regimen of spiriva 1 CAP
daily and advair 500/50 1 INH [**Hospital1 **].

# Depression/Anxiety: She was continued on her home regimen of
citalopram and lorazepam prn.

# Hx of back injury:  Her pain was well controlled on her home
regimen of oxycodone 5-10 mg PO/NG Q4H:PRN.

# Goals of care DNR/DNI.  Patient plans to transition to hospice
care and will discuss with her VNA.
