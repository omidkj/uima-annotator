HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 10211**] is a 45-year-old man
with a history of HIV and hepatitis C who was a pedestrian
hit by debris from a nearby car accident on the street.  He
did not come to the hospital immediately but presented late
at night on the day of the accident.  On arrival he
complained of abdominal pain, nausea, and left rib and flank
pain.  He received an abdominal CT scan which showed a
shattered spleen and a massive amount of hemorrhage
throughout the abdomen.  There was also a fracture of the
left tenth rib.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
AIDS, peptic ulcer disease, schizophrenia with auditory
hallucinations, hepatitis C, intravenous drug abuse, ethanol
abuse.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies..

MEDICATIONS:  Prilosec 10 once daily, ? Celexa 10 once daily,
? Zyprexa 20 q.h.s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival the patient was an alert
and oriented man with a temperature of 95, pulse 105, blood
pressure 105/60, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 92% on
two liters.  Heart was regular with tachycardia.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was distended
without tympany, and diffusely tender especially in the left
upper quadrant.  Rectal examination showed normal tone,
guaiac positive, but there was blood at the rectal site from
line placement.  Extremities were warm.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  On arrival the patient had a white count
of 10.8, hematocrit of 21.6, platelet count 264.  On
discharge the white count was 12.4, hematocrit 33.2, platelet
count 495.  Electrolytes:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.0,
chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, BUN 5, creatinine 0.4, glucose
of 72.

Abdominal CT scan shows grade 5 rupture of spleen with blood
around the liver and blood in the pelvis.  There is no active
extravasation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 10211**] was watched very closely on his
arrival to the emergency room, once he received an abdominal
CT scan which showed a ruptured spleen.  He received
intravenous access and was resuscitated with blood products.
He was transferred to the intensive care unit where his
resuscitation was continued.  During this, however, his
status went from being comfortable, alert and oriented, to
being in acute respiratory distress.  He was therefore being
intubated and emergently taken to the operating room for a
splenectomy.

In the operating room on [**2123-4-3**], he received an uneventful
splenectomy and he was transferred back to the intensive care
unit.  One hour post his transfer back he began acutely
dropping his blood pressure and he received additional blood
products to maintain his hemodynamic normalcy.  He was rushed
back to the operating room and he was found to have a large
amount of blood in his abdomen which, on exploration, was due
to arterial bleed in the splenic bed.  This was repaired.
The abdomen was closed again, and Mr. [**Known lastname 10211**] was brought back
to the intensive care unit intubated.

The patient's recover after this was fairly unremarkable
except for waking up slowly.  He was extubated on hospital
day three.  He remained sleepy for another day or two and
then after withdrawal of all of his sedating medications
including Ativan, he woke up appropriately.

On discharge he is alert, oriented, and recalls most of his
events.  He is tolerating a regular diet and is ambulating.
His incision is clean, dry, and intact with staples.
