History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84yo man with h/o DM, HTN, pacemaker, GERD and
esophagitis who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital today after
having rigors and with back pain after a fall last week. He was
found to be febrile to 101, tachy to HR 120s, with ? of
irregular heart beat, with BP initially 100/70s -->80s/60s, and
WBC 1.0. He was diagnosed with sepsis of unclear source and was
treated with 2 L NS, a LIJ was placed, Neo was started for
hypotension, and he was given Ceftazidime, Vancomycin,
Metronidazole for broad coverage given fear of neutropenia.
Cardiac Enzymes were drawn and were negative. EKG was
unremarkable. troponin I was 0.6. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for likely ICU admission.
.
On arrival here his temp was 99.0 degrees, CVP 18. He was
switched to levophed for blood pressure control with systolics
ranging in the 90s-100s. He had no back or abdominal tenderness.
EKG showed a new Q in II as well as biphasic T waves and a
troponin of 0.27. The patient was discussed with cardiology who
found this unlikely to be primary ACS and recommended serial
cardiac enzymes, but not want to start a heparin drip. He
received a total of 3L of fluid to maintain his blood pressures,
was later weaned from pressors and transferred to the general
medicine floor for further management.

Imaging:
[**2138-11-20**]: RUQ U/S: Mild gallbladder wall edema with multiple
gallstones. The gallbladder wall edema is a nonspecific finding
that may be seen in the presence of cholecystitis, third
spacing, or liver disease such as hepatitis, or pancreatitis
among others. If there is continued clinical concern for acute
cholecystitis, further evaluation with a HIDA scan is
recommended.
.
[**2138-11-21**]: HIDA: Partial gallbladder filling, which is not
consistent with acute cholecystitis.
.
Admission EKG: Sinus rhythm with possible ventricular pacing
fusion complexes
Borderline first degree A-V delay
Left atrial abnormality
Inferior infarct, age indeterminate
Consider anterior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate
ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot exclude in part ischemia
Clinical correlation is suggested
No previous tracing available for comparison
.
[**2138-11-21**]: ECHO: Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic
function appears
depressed. Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be
reliably
assessed.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
.
Admission CXR: left lower lobe atelectasis
.
[**2138-11-22**]: EKG: Atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular
paced beats. Non-specific
T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2138-11-21**]
ventriciular rate
is slower, intermitent ventricular paced beats are present and
further
T wave abnormalities are seen.
.
[**2138-11-25**]: CXR: Improvement of previously described mostly
unilateral pulmonary edema but bilateral pleural effusions
remaining. No new areas of parenchymal densities have developed

Brief Hospital Course:
By problem:
.
# Gram negative rod septicemia:
Patient initially presented with leukocytosis and bandemia and
later was found to have e. coli bacteremia in [**4-8**] blood cultures
from the OSH.  While in the MICU the patient was treated with
vancomycin, metronidazole and levofloxacin initially.  Once
speciation of the bacteria was known antibiotics were changed to
meropenem. Source of this infection is unclear, but likely
either a UTI or GI source.  Initial ultrasound and LFTs seemed
consistent with a biliary tree infection, though HIDA scan
showed no signs of cholecystitis.  Given that the patient has a
history of UTI's, it seems more likely that the patient had a
urinary source.  The patient initially presented with
hypotension requiring pressors, but was quickly weaned off.
Then on [**11-22**] the patient was then again hypotensive and
required pressors briefly (5-6 hours).  They were quickly
weaned.  The day prior to the floor, he was transitioned to
meropenem and vanco.  His sensitivities from OSH were obtained
and grew E. Coli pan-sensitive.  He was stable and transferred
to the floor on [**11-24**].  His abx were changed to cipro po.  He
spiked a temperature to 103 the first night on the floor and
changed briefly back to meropenem.  He also was hypotensive to
85 systolic.  He responded to 250cc bolus and his cardiac
enzymes and EKG were normal.  Thereafter, he remained stable and
we aim to treat with cipro for 14days of total of ciprofloxacin.
.
# Cards Vascular: Initially he had EKG changes (as above) and
elevated troponin in face of flat CKs: Unable to compare
troponin here to at OSH given different lab values. He was
evaluated by cards who recognized that the LBBB was a paced
rhythm and that his labs were not consistent with ACS.  We
cycled his enzymes again while on the floor (after episode of
hypotension) and they remained low.
- Echo was done to evaluate cardiac function and showed
depressed cardiac function, but no signs of wall motion
abnormality.
.
# Lower Extremity [**Name (NI) 70101**]
Pt reports chronic [**Location (un) **] likely secondary to venous insufficiency.
Pt also received fluids during his hospitalization to support
his blood pressures. In time the pt will will mobilize this
fluid and he was actively diuresed prior to discharge and his
potassium was repleted. He should be further diuresed as an
facility.
.
# Thrombocytopenia- Patient had rapid drop in platelets. Given
this it was concerning that the patient may have had a TTP/HUS
like syndrome.  However, smear was negative for schistocytes.
Additionally a HIT antibody was checked and negative.  Platelets
have recovered without treatment making the likely cause sepsis.
 Upon discharge his platelets were above 100 and we restarted
ranitidine.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline appears to be 1.6 and
patient returned to baseline quickly.  He remained at or near
1.6 throughout his stay.
.
# Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia and we
continued his home regimen.
