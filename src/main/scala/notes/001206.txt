Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Claudication-->re-look LE angiography.



Claudication-->Elective PERIPHERAL VASCULAR angiography

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P PTA of L SFA & CFA, athrectomy of R CFA, PTA/Stent (3) of R
SFA
& PTA of R TPT


History of Present Illness:
This 67 year old man has a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse,  CAD s/p CABG and known PVD, s/p
many prior LE interventions.  Mr [**Known lastname 30301**] presents for  a relook
LE angiography.  The patient's daughter reports that about three
weeks ago her father began to have recurrent leg claudication,
occurring with walking about half a block.  She is unclear on
which leg may be bothersome.  After his last revascularization,
for a brief period, he had some improvement of his claudiation,
which has returned since.
.
In terms of cardiac symptoms, he has no chest discomfort. He
does
have dyspnea with activity such climbing up one flight of
stairs. It is worse with the recent increase in humidity. He is
on oxygen 2l via nasal cannula at
night while sleeping.

Peripheral vasc. history includes:
[**2175-4-3**] ABI: 0.51 right, 0.59 left
[**2175-7-10**] Lower extremity angiogram: Right- Internal iliac artery
occluded. External iliac artery occluded at the exit to the CFA.
The CFA had a short occlusion to the SFA/PFA bifurcation with
the PDA filling the distal SFA. Left- Common iliac artery was
normal.  External iliac artery was occluded at the bifurcation
with the internal iliac artery. Common femoral artery occluded.
SFA patent below the occlusion. S/P successful Right CFA and
[**Month/Day/Year 30302**] intervention with cryoplasty to the SFA.
[**2175-8-2**]: successful recanalization of the [**Female First Name (un) 7195**] followed by
atherectomy and stenting
[**2176-2-14**] LE angio: (right brachial artery access):
RLE: diffuse disease in the CIA. IIA with an 80% stenosis. CFA
totally occluded.
LLE: moderate diffuse disease of the CIA. Prior EIA stent with
an 80% lesion and no flow down the external iliac artery. SFA
totally occluded proximally. Attempt at revascularization of the
left EIA unsuccessful.
[**2176-2-15**]: (access via left brachial artery):PTA of the origin of
the left internal iliac artery with a 5.0 mm balloon. Successful
PTA of the totally occluded RCFA and SFA with a 4.0 balloon.
[**2176-2-16**] LLE angiography: prior stent and CFA patent with a
distal dissection noted  in the CFA with ulceration. SFA flush
occluded at the origin, PFA patent with collateralization of the
distal SFA.  Successful recanalization of the Left SFA with PTA
using a 5.0 mm balloon. Successful cryoplasty of the [**Doctor First Name **], LCFA
into the [**Doctor First Name 30303**].
[**2176-4-23**]:MRI of LE:  Mild atherosclerotic disease in the iliac
arteries and LE's. No hemodynamically significant stenosis
present.

[**2176-6-7**] MRI/MRA of abdomen (limited examination): Moderate focal
stenosis of the origin of the celiac artery. Diffuse narrowing
of the left common iliac artery with approximately a 7 mm long
segment of moderate to severe stenosis in the proximal left
common iliac artery, about 5mm from its origin. Possible severe
stenosis at the origins of the internal iliac arteries. Several
areas of mild stenosis in the right external iliac artery. No
definite flow seen in the right SFA consistent with occlusion.
LLE: (limited due to opacification)-Appearance of flow in the
left SFA although evaluation is limited. Flow in the popliteal
appears less than compared to the right. Flow in the left AT to
the level of the ankle noted with poor appearing flow in the
distal left anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.

Pertinent Results:

*** Not Signed Out ***
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Diffuse and critical bilateral CFA, SFA disease.
2. successful PTA of the LCFA
3. succesful PTA of the [**Month/Day/Year 30303**]
4. Successful PTA and stenting of the [**Month/Day/Year 30302**]

ART DUP EXT UP UNI LMTD RIGHT  [**2176-6-14**]
FINDINGS: No pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula involving the right
brachial access site. A focal area of velocity elevation in the
brachial artery just above the antecubital fossa is identified,
reaching 486 cm/sec. This indicates a high-grade stenosis in
this area.

Angiography & PTA -- [**2176-6-14**]
*** Not Signed Out ***
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Occluded RBA treated with PTA
2. Occluded RCFA treated with stenting and thrombectomy


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 30301**] presents for  a relook LE angiography. He
has a ho multiple LLE interventions in the past. He also has a
background of CABG, current smoking and COPD.
.
He underwent angiography & PTA of LCFA & [**Name (NI) 30303**], PTA and stenting
of the [**Name (NI) 30302**], PTA of the popliteal perforation, PTA of the RCFA.
Following the procedure, the pt underwent duplex scan of his
right arm, which suggested a significant
obstruction in his R brachial artery.  The pt was taken back to
the cath lab for further evaluation with angiography.  During
catheterization, the pt was found to have occluded RBA treated
with PTA.  He was also found to have occluded RCFA treated with
stenting and thrombectomy.
.
The pt recovered well from the procedures.  However, his HCT
dropped and he was transfused 2uPRBCs.  The drop was thought to
be due to blood loss & fluids given peri-procedure.  His Hct
repsonded appropriately to the transfusion.  He was discharged
following transfusion.
