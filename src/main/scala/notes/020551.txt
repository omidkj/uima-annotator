History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who
was recently found to have a murmer. He underwent an
echocardiogram which revealed severe
aortic stenosis. He reports chronic dyspnea on exertion while
walking his dog. The dyspnea is stable and probably
multifactorial, including COPD. He also underwent a cardiac cath
which again revealed severe aortic stenosis along with two
vessel coronary artery disease. Presents today for surgical
evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2116-3-5**] - ECHO
PREBYPASS:
Preserved LV systolic function with LVEF = 55%. The left atrium
is mildly dilated. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter with minimal atherosclerotic plaque . The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Normal TV and PV. There is no pericardial effusion. Normal
coronary sinus. No clot seen in LAA. Intact IAS.

POSTBYPASS:
Normally functioning AV prosthesis with no sig AI or AS. Normal
systolic funciton. Otherwise unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-3-5**] for surgical
management of his heart disease. he was taken directly to the
operating room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement
using a mechanical valve and coronary artery bypass grafting to
two vessels. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. A bronchoscopy was performed given his poor
oxygenation. His left main bronchus was noted to be collapsed
which was opened. He remained intubated. Gram positive rods were
noted in his sputum and he was placed on vancomycin and zosyn.
He required and second bronchoscopy for secretions. Pressors
were slowly weaned over a couple days. He was slow to wake from
sedation. Scant bloody drainage was noted from his sternotomy.
Coumadin was started for his mechanical valve with a heparin
bridge. Diuresis was initiated given his volume overload. Low
dose precedex was started as his propfol was weaned off. On
postoperative day 4, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Zyprexa was given for some postoperative delerium
with good effect. He required inhalers for his COPD. On
postoperative day eight, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. Zosyn and vancomycin were stopped and keflex
wascontinued  for his sternal drainage. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to
make steady progress and was discharged [**Hospital 6595**]
Rehabilitation in [**Location (un) 1456**] on [**2116-3-16**]. Expected length of stay is
