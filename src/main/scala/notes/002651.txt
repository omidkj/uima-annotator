History of Present Illness:
46M s/p liver transplant [**2143-7-26**] presents to the ED from
[**Hospital **] Rehab after having [**5-16**] bloody bowel movements overnight
accompanied with hallucinations.  He bright red blood per rectum
mixed with stool/on the toilet paper/in the toilet bowl
intermittently over the past week though it wasn't obvious or
severe until last night when he had [**5-16**] bloody bowel movements,
initially "almost entirely" clot with some solid material in it
and transitioning to mostly brown liquid stool with some blood
in
it.  He reports that he has otherwise been having [**2-12**] normal,
formed bowel movements daily, no diarrhea or constipation.

He also reports hallucinations last night, confirmed by his RN
who accompanies him from [**Hospital1 **].  He reports that he felt as
though his cat was following him and that there was someone
speaking to him in a low voice.  He readily acknowledges that he
was aware the entire time as he is now that these were, in fact,
hallucinations and not real.  He denies hallucinations currently
but does feel slightly "foggy...like it's hard to pay
attention".

Of note, his post-operative course was significant for
persistent
hyperkalemia for which he was started on fludricortisone with
good results.  This was discontinued in clinic followup.

ROS: As per HPI, otherwise denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
46M s/p liver transplant [**2143-7-26**] presents to the ED from [**Hospital **]
Rehab with bloody stools and hallucinations. On admission, hct
was 27.1. He was transferred to the SICU where a colonoscopy was
performed. This demonstrated a small polyp in the distal colon
that was not removed. There was an irregular, bumpy, friable
mucosa in the rectum that was biopsied. Large non-bleeding
hemorrhoids were seen. Otherwise, normal colonoscopy to cecum.
He was transfused with 3 units of PRBC with hct increase to 29.
Hct remained stable. Rectal mucosal biopsies demonstrated
colonic mucosa with surface hyperplastic change; otherwise,
within normal limits. He was started on iron. EGD was not done
at that time, but will be arranged as an outpatient.

Liver duplex was unremarkable. LFTs were stable.
Immunosuppression continued with daily adjustment to Prograf
based on trough levels.

He developed SVT/afib which was treated with Lopressor and
diltiazem. He continued to have intermittent brief episodes of
tachycardia with rates up to 200. Lopressor and Diltiazem doses
were adjusted. He was ruled out for MI. Once stable, he was
transferred out of SICU. However, he went back to the SICU on
[**9-1**] for non-sustained Vtach which responded to diltiazem doses
and lopressor adjustment. Once stable again, he was transferred
back to Med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit again.

On [**9-4**], he complained of SOB. Breath sounds were diminished [**2-11**]
way up on right lung. CXR showed a small pleural effusion. This
was also noted on liver duplex. A repeat CXR was done on [**9-5**],
showing stable RLL and possibly RML collapse. IP was consulted
and a 1400ml thoracentesis was performed. Post thoracentesis CXR
revealed significantly improved right pleural effusion, to near
resolution and no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion was
unremarkable. Culture was negative. Follow up CXR on [**9-6**]
demonstrated small re accumulation of right pleural effusion.

His mental status was notable for confusion and a delirium.
Oxycodone, Wellbutrin,and Lidocaine patch were stopped.
Prednisone was decreased to 10mg daily. Mental status became
more alert/oriented and improved, however, he continues to be
slow to answer and disorganized in his thought process/answers.
Blood sugars were well controlled.

Abdominal incision wound VAC continued to be changed every 3
days. Output/drainage was minimal.

PT evaluated and recommended rehab. He feels weak during
ambulation and has decreased endurance. SBP runs on the low side
and fall precautions were implemented. SBP ranged between
99-114/73 with HR in 80s. O2 was mid 90s to 100 on room air.

[**Hospital **] Rehab was approved and he will transfer there today.
