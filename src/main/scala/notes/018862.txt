Admission Date:  [**2142-11-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-11-16**]


Service: Neurosurgery

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Subdural hematoma.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  History of falling down.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old white
female with a history of hypertension, transient ischemic
attacks, multiple falls, and a history of idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura; who according to her son had fallen
at least three times in the last two weeks prior to
admission.

On the morning of admission, a [**Hospital6 407**]
nurse found the patient on the ground, called 911, and the
patient was sent to the [**Hospital6 2561**].  The patient
seemed to have slurred speech at that time and therefore
received CT scan and found to have a subdural hematoma and
was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history includes)
1.  History of transient ischemic attack.
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Multi-infarct dementia.
5.  History of abdominal aortic aneurysm 6 cm in size.
6.  History of diverticulitis.
7.  History of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
8.  History of several falls and a fracture of the left femur
and right ankle in the past, and a hip repair to the left in
the past.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications include aspirin,
Norvasc, Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure
of 141/68, heart rate 81, respiratory rate 25, and oxygen
saturation of 99% on 3 liters nasal cannula.  She was awake
and oriented to hospital but thought it was [**2101-11-3**].
Her speech was slurred but somewhat fluent, and she followed
commands.  The pupils were 3 mm bilaterally and reactive to
2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular movements showed a question of
an upward gaze limitation.  Visual fields were grossly intact
to confrontation.  Face was symmetric.  Palate and tongue
were midline, and shoulder shrug was symmetric.  Motor
examination showed a slight right-sided drift, and reflexes
were hyperreflexic on the right with the right toe going up.
The remainder of the physical examination including the ears,
nose, throat, heart, lungs, and abdomen was essentially
unremarkable.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Admission
laboratories showed a white blood cell count of 9, hematocrit
of 29.1, platelet count of 499.  Chem-7 revealed sodium
of 134, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 27.3, blood
urea nitrogen 9, creatinine 0.5, and blood glucose was 89.
Coagulations revealed PT was 13.4, PTT was 23.7, and INR
of 1.1.  Creatine kinase and troponin were negative on
admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Due to the clinical findings, the patient
was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**] as the attending who felt the patient would
require evacuation of the subdural hematoma.

The patient was therefore taken to the operating room on
[**2142-11-6**] where under general endotracheal anesthesia
the patient underwent a front bur-hole irrigation of subdural
space with evacuation of hematoma and insertion of red rubber
catheter for drainage.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and returned to the Neurologic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.

Postoperatively, was noted to be awake and alert but
inattentive and not following commands.  There was no speech
output and she was globally aphasic.  She was moving all
extremities strongly.  A repeat CT scan showed some
improvement in the subdural hematoma, but the catheter was
deep within the hematoma and was therefore pulled back
approximately 1.5 cm, and review of the CT scan by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**] indicated residual subdural collection, and
therefore electively the patient was taken back to the
operating room due to the clinical examination findings of
aphasia, and she underwent a revision of bur holes in the
frontal and parietal area with evacuation of subdural
hematoma and reinsertion of a subdural drain.  The patient
tolerated this procedure well and was again returned to the
Neurologic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  Again,
she was awake and alert but somewhat inattentive following
the procedure.  She was noted to be moving all extremities,
left greater than right and had a mild right hemiparesis and
also continued to be aphasic.  Furthermore, the patient was
noted to not be following any commands after the second
surgery.

A subsequent repeat CT scan showed adequate drainage of the
subdural hematoma and the subdural drain was removed.  The
patient was seen in consultation by the Physiotherapy
Service, and Occupational Therapy Service, and the Nutrition
Service.  She was also subsequently transferred from the
Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit to the neurosurgery
hospital floor, and her condition remained stable until
[**11-16**] when early in the morning she was found to be
pulseless and in cardiopulmonary arrest.

A code was called.  The patient was reintubated.  A advanced
cardiac life support algorithm for asystole was applied by
the code team, but the patient showed no response, and all
efforts were ceased, and the patient was declared deceased at
7:10 a.m. on [**2142-11-16**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Deceased.
