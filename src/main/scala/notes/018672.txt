Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a
68-year-old male with cirrhosis presumed due to alcohol use,
diabetes type 2, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal
insufficiency who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on
[**2114-3-28**] due to worsening renal failure and increased weight
gain.  The patient's laboratory data is currently remarkable
for a creatinine of 4.3 from a baseline of 2.

The patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-4-6**] for
evaluation of acute renal failure and for consideration of
TIPS.  Paracentesis was performed to rule out spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis.

Since admission, the patient was started on Levofloxacin for
pneumonia.  He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells.  He underwent thoracentesis of right hemithorax fluid
consistent with a transudate.  He was treated with albumin
and was started on midodrine and Octreotide.

With the administration of albumin, packed red blood cells,
and IV fluids, the patient became volume overloaded and
experienced worsening respiratory distress.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU for further monitoring.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the MICU, the patient continued to be
treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin and was noted to have
worsening bilateral alveolar infiltrates and bilateral
effusions, all consistent with pulmonary edema.  His
oxygenation remained adequate on 100% nonrebreather.  Since
aggressive diuresis would further worsen the patient's renal
function, he was placed on noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation.

The patient had worsening delirium and worsening acidosis.  A
family meeting was held to determine the plan of care.  The
family decided to pursue comfort measures.  The patient was
started on a morphine drip and was transferred to the Medical
Service.

The patient passed away on the night of [**2114-4-11**].

DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic renal insufficiency with concomitant hepatorenal
syndrome.
2.  Cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus with retinopathy.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Spinal stenosis, status post laminectomy.
8.  Pancreatitis.
9.  History of myocardial infarction.
10. Cholelithiasis, status post cholecystectomy.

As noted above, the patient was transferred to the Medical
Service for comfort measures and was maintained on a morphine
drip.
