HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 40-year-old gentleman
who was an unrestrained driver involved in a roll-over motor
vehicle crash who was ejected from the car.  The [**Known firstname **] was
found unresponsive at the scene with a GCS of 8 and was taken
to an outside hospital where he was intubated for airway
control.  The [**Known firstname **] was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation and
management.  While in the trauma bay the [**Known firstname **] was
intubated and was not moving extremities.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant only for hypertension and
alcohol abuse.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the trauma bay, the [**Known firstname 228**]
temperature was 96 degrees with a blood pressure of 176/103,
heart rate 124.  As previously mentioned, the [**Known firstname **] was
intubated.  His head examination was notable for reactive
pupils.  He did have blood in his nares.  There was no
obvious mid face instability.  His chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally with equal breath sounds.  His
trachea was midline.  Cardiovascular was regular but
tachycardic.  His abdomen was soft and non-distended.
Extremities:  Notable for a right forearm open large
laceration with brisk what appeared to be arterial bleeding,
a palpable radial pulse, however.  His lower extremities were
notable for a left leg deformity, however, he had palpable
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
His back had no step-offs and no obvious contusions.  Rectal
examination was significant for lax tone and it was guaiac
negative.

The [**Known firstname **] had a FAST examination in the trauma bay which
was negative for free fluid.

LABORATORY:  On arrival, white count 14.3, hematocrit 32,
platelet count 209,000.  His coagulation studies were PT
13.9, PTT 27.3 with INR 1.3.  His chemistries were
essentially normal.  He had a lactate of 2.9 and an EToH
level of 306.

RADIOLOGY:  The [**Known firstname 228**] chest x-ray taken in the trauma bay
was notable for a small pneumothorax in the left base as well
as likely pulmonary contusions involving the left mid to
lower lung zones.  Plain film of the pelvis was negative for
obvious fracture or dislocation.  The [**Known firstname **] had multiple
imaging studies in his workup including CT of the head, chest
and abdomen.  CT of his chest showed a moderate-sized left
hemothorax with a small anterior pneumothorax.  There
fractures of the first and third through tenth as well as
12th ribs on the left side with associated atelectasis and
contusion in the left mid lung zones.  There were no obvious
right-sided fractures or right-sided pleural effusions.  CT
of the abdomen was negative for solid organ injury.  There
was no free fluid.  CT of the head showed moderate amount of
acute intracranial hemorrhage extending on the right frontal
lobe inferiorly into the middle cranial fossa.  There was
also a moderate sized hematoma within the anterior aspect of
the right temporal lobe.  Additionally, there was noted a
small focus of acute hemorrhage within the right cerebral
hemisphere with associated edema within the right frontal and
right temporal lobes.  There was slight mass effect in the
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle without shift of
the midline structures.  There was no hydrocephalus.  Bone
windows demonstrated a skull base fracture centered over the
left occipital bone to the level of the foramen magnum.  A
second fracture line extended laterally to the left external
ear canal extending superior into the squamosa portion.
There was some fluid noted in the left middle ear.  There was
trace pneumocephalus in the posterior fossa and adjacent to
the left temporal bone fracture.  There was noted to be acute
hemorrhage lying over the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally.  The
[**Known firstname **] also underwent CT scan of his entire spine including
cervical, thoracic and lumbar.  This revealed nondisplaced
fracture of the posterior elements of C6 as well as a chip
fracture of the left transverse process of T1 and a left
first rib fracture.  CT scan of the lumbar spine was negative
for any acute fractures.

The [**Known firstname **] had a left-sided chest tube for his left
hemothorax and pneumothorax secondary to his multiple rib
fractures.  The [**Known firstname **] was resuscitated with crystalloid and
taken to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring and resuscitation.  A Neurosurgery consult was
obtained to evaluate his head injury.  The [**Known firstname **] had an
intraventricular drain placed by the Neurosurgery team to
monitor his intracranial pressures.  He was placed on
mannitol to control his intracranial pressures which were
initially high.  Much more central IV access was obtained for
resuscitation as well as monitoring purposes.  The large
laceration on the [**Known firstname 228**] right arm was sutured once the
bleeding had been controlled.  There was no major arterial or
vascular injury associated with that laceration.  The [**Known firstname **]
did receive tetanus toxoid booster.  There was noted to be
blood draining from the ear canals.  Because of that an ENT
consult was obtained.  They evaluated the [**Known firstname **] and thought
no intervention was needed as related to his skull fractures.
[**Known firstname **] was treated with ciprofloxacin otic drops for
prophylaxis against infection.  The [**Known firstname **] continued to be
monitored in the Intensive Care Unit and was noted to have
worsening intracranial pressures.  The [**Known firstname **] also started
to develop intense seizure activity for which he was loaded
with Dilantin and ultimately was required to be put in a
pentobarbital coma to control his severe seizures.  Because
of his worsening seizure activity as well as his increasing
intracranial pressures, the Neurosurgical team decided to
take him to the Operating Room where he underwent craniotomy
on the right side.  A right temporal craniotomy with
evacuation of hematoma and a right temporal lobectomy was
performed on [**2151-7-7**].  The [**Known firstname **] prior to this had
undergone an angiogram of the cerebral vessels which did not
show any acute dissection of the carotid arteries or
vertebral arteries.  The [**Known firstname 228**] mental status remained
extremely poor.  The [**Known firstname **] was weaned off of the
pentobarbital coma and was maintained on seizure prophylaxis
with Dilantin and Depakote and his seizure activity ceased to
be a problem.  The [**Known firstname **] remained in a hard C-collar
throughout his hospital stay because of his posterior C6
fracture.  He did not have cord compromise from this fracture
and the plan per Neurosurgery was to just treat him with a
hard collar at this time.  The [**Known firstname **] remained on
ventilatory support throughout this stage of his hospital
course.  Over the next several weeks he was weaned off of his
ventilatory support.  His left-sided chest tube was removed
and he eventually was maintained on a trach collar with
satisfactory blood gases.  His neurologic status slowly
improved.  He became more awake and alert, was moving all of
his extremities although his left extremities were weaker and
he did not move those as much as the right but there was
noted improvement throughout the end of his hospital stay.
His ventriculostomy drain was ultimately clamped and his
ICP's remained acceptable for 48 hours and, because of this,
the ventriculostomy drain was removed.  The [**Known firstname **] continued
to make slow improvement neurologically.  Because of his poor
mental status and likely need for long term neuro rehab, he
underwent tracheostomy placement as well as PEG placement
during his hospital stay.  These procedures were performed
without difficulty.  Not previously mentioned is the fact
that the [**Known firstname 228**] left foot was imaged with plain films to
evaluate what appeared to be a deformity.  He was found to
