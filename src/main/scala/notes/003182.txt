Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
44yo F w/ PMHx significant for EtOH abuse, pancreatitis, known
cholethiasis presented to the ED with 3 days of RUQ pain. This
RUQ pain was not relieved with tylenol and motrin. The pain
starts in the RUQ and radiates to the midaxillary line or to her
back. The pain has been so severe that she has not had an
appetite and has not been able to sleep well. When she does eat,
she has noticed that there are times when her abdominal pain is
worse. She reports nausea and vomitting. She also reports
weakness and chills, but denies fevers. She reports diarrhea
over the past couple of days as well as dark stools but not
melena. She denies hematochezia. She reports defuse itching that
started today.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.0 P 98 BP 94/58 R 15 O2 sat
100% RA. The patient was started on Unasyn 3mg IV times 1 and
given morphine 2mg IV x3, and zofran 4mg IV. Surgery also saw
the patient while she was in the ED recommended that the patient
have urgent ERCP to relieve CBD obstruction and to have a
cholecystectomy once her cholangitis resolves during this
hospitalization. Because of persisently low BPs, the patient was
bolused for a total of 5L of NS. Despite volume resuscitation,
the patient's SBP remained in the 80s. A LIJ was placed in the
ED and placement confirmed with CXR. The patient was
subsequently started on Levophed at 0.03mcg/kg/min. Of note,
vancomycin was also started in the ED and prior to transfer she
recieved 1mg IV Dilaudid.
.
When the patient arrived to the unit, VS were: T 96.5 HR 119 BP
99/65 RR 19 O2 Sat 97% RA. The patient is conversant and able to
provide her history. Levophed was set at 0.3mcg/kg/hr.

[**2100-7-14**] CTA Abd W and W/o contrast:
IMPRESSION: Decompressed biliary tree following placement of
plastic stent.
Persistent pancreatic duct dilatation. Ill-defined hypoenhancing
area in the
pancreatic head is nonspecific and may relate to an area of
focal
pancreatitis; however, a focal mass lesion cannot be excluded.
There are a
number of peripancreatic lymph nodes which are enlarged as
described above.

Normal appearance of the kidneys and adrenal glands.

Correlation with outside imaging would be of benefit to evaluate
for interval
change. A low-attenuation predominantly cystic lesion in the
pancreatic tail
likely represents a small pseudocyst. The lesion appears to
indent the
stomach.

[**2100-7-16**]: US ABD: IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous liver parenchyma in keeping with fatty
infiltration.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
3. Satisfactory position of the CBD stent with air in the CBD
and left-sided
biliary duct system.
4. There is persitent irregular eccentric gall bladder wall
thickening
measuring 1.4 cm maximally.
5. Pancreatic duct dilatation as described.

[**7-16**] CXR: mild lower lobe atelectasis.

ERCP Impression:
A stricture was seen at the distal common bile duct.
A sphincterotomy was performed.
Balloon sweep was peformed without extraction of stones or
sludge.
A 7cm by 10FR Plastic stent biliary stent was placed
successfully.
A single  2 cm stricture was seen in the distal pancreatic duct
CBD and PD stricture most likely secondary to pancreatic mass
vs. chronic pancreatitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:44yo F w/ PMHx significant for EtOH abuse,
pancreatitis, known cholethiasis presented to the ED with 3 days
of RUQ pain and hypotension.

#Hypotension: Pressures unresponsive to saline boluses in ED.
She had a central line placed in the ED and was started on
Levophed in the ED with normotensive pressures in the unit. The
patient's hypotension was thought to be multifactorial in
etiology in part due to sepsis with her biliary tree being a
likely source of infection and poor oral intake in the days
prior to admission. On admission, patient had a lactate of 2.
She was weaned from pressors as tolerated, with a goal of
keeping MAPs >65 and bolusing with NS PRN to maintain CVPs
between 8 and 12. Antibiotics were started in the ED and
continued through the patient's in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Since being off
pressors, the patient's BPs were maintained without fluid
boluses.
.
#RUQ Pain: RUQ U/S showing dilated pancreatic duct and a
heterogeneous pancreas as well as cholelithasis and elevated
LFTs were suggestive of an obstructing process. The differential
for the patient's RUQ pain upon admission included Pancreatits
versus cholecystitis versus ascending cholangitis. She was seen
by surgery in the ED who recommended ERCP and cholecystectomy
later during the hospitalization. ERCP was performed and showed
pancreatic/CBD strictures c/w malignancy vs chronic
pancreatitis. The patient also had a biliary stent placed. Given
the concern for malignancy, the patient had an abdominal CT
done, which showed 2.4x2.0 cm (3a:38) cystic structure arising
from the panc tail could reflect pancreatic pseudocyst (given
h/o EtOH pancreatitis) vs. cystic pancreatic neoplasm. No
definite pancreatic head mass though artifact from CBD stent
limits assessment. Panc duct is dilated as on recent ERCP.
Irregularity also seen in pancreatic tail (3a:46) of uncertain
significance. Fatty liver. Heterogeneous perfusion in the liver
is noted with multiple, non mass like sites of early arterial
enhancement. Enlarged celiac and portocaval nodes. Gastrosplenic
varicies noted. Gen
