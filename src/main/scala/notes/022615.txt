Service:  VASC [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was an
84 year old gentleman with multiple past medical problems
including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, history of sinus
node dysfunction status post dual chamber pacemaker placement
in [**2108-8-22**], history of long term hypertension, well
known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm which was
documented that had grown from 5.5 centimeters in [**2109-8-22**] to 7.2 mg on [**2110-9-17**].  The patient at that time
had previously declined elective surgery and when he was
noticed to have this increasing size in his abdominal aortic
aneurysm, he continued to decline elective abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair.

He also had a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a
compromised ejection fraction of 40%.  He had a history of a
left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, history of
gastroesophageal reflux disease, history of degenerative
joint disease.  The patient is status post left hip
arthroplasty, history of left ventricular hypertrophy,
history of mild aortic regurgitation with moderate mitral
regurgitation and finally a history of hemorrhoidectomy in
the distant past.

With his multiple medical problems, he presented to his
primary care physician on the evening of [**10-10**] for
weakness and general malaise.  He was found to have a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s and also a complaint of
having episodes of melana.  He was transferred emergently to
the Emergency Department where upon arrival he was found to
be hypertensive and tachycardic.  Due his known history of
the 7.2 centimeters abdominal aortic aneurysm, an emergent
ultrasound was obtained and it documented an intact aneurysm.
Upon obtaining good intravenous access and resuscitating him
with intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells, a CT scan
was obtained and demonstrated a primary aortic enteric
fistula.  While in the Emergency Room, the patient began
bleeding red blood from nose, mouth as well as continued to
have episodes of massive melena.  He was intubated for airway
protection and the seriousness and acuity of his condition
was discussed with the distant relatives present at that time
Prior to his intubation, Mr. [**Known lastname 98538**] discussed going to
surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  At that point, he wanted surgical
intervention.

An emergent Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained and
the family was explained about the great risk and high
mortality of this kind of procedure, but despite this, they
knew that the patient wished to have surgery on those
conditions and he was scheduled to undergo an emergent
surgical repair.

On [**2110-10-10**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room where he underwent a resection of the 7.2 centimeter
infrarenal aortic aneurysm that required a temporary
supra-celiac cross clamp of about 30 minutes and a 40 minute
infrarenal aortic cross clamp as well as a replacement of the
aorta with a 20 millimeter Dacron tube graft.  Subsequently
the sac of the aneurysm was debrided and an omental pedicle
coverage of the graft was performed.  An intraoperative
consultation was obtained with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] from the
Blue Surgical Team who performed a duodenal fistula
resection, duodenotomy closure with an omental flap
placement. Due to the aggressive resuscitation and the
patient's instability, the abdomen was left open but covered
with a sterile drape with drains as well as a pack.  The
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
continued monitoring and full support.

He was started on broad empiric antibiotic coverage.  Two
days later, the patient improved moderately from a
hemodynamic standpoint and it was decided that it was a
reasonable time to attempt a primary closure.  The plan was
also to remove the pack within the abdominal cavity and the
patient was taken back to the Operating Room with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] from the Blue Team a second time.

He tolerated the procedure well.  It was impossible to close
him primarily and subsequently he was transferred once again
to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and
support.

His postoperative course was long and complicated.  He
eventually grew Enterococcus klebsiella, Bacteroides fragilis
as well as other organisms from the intraoperative cultures. He
was started on Levofloxacin, AmBisome, Zosyn as well as
Vancomycin with the guidance and input of Infectious Disease.
All along this time, he was supported with intravenous fluids
and vasopressors and he was started on total parenteral
nutrition.

Over the course of the next couple of weeks, he became
progressively icteric and he was noted to have an elevated
bilirubin.  It was thought at that time that he might have
had cholestasis since multiple ultrasounds did not reveal any
signs
of cholecystitis.  He was scheduled to undergo an endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography at the beginning of
[**Month (only) 359**] and this study did not reveal any potential blockage
or obstruction.  He was found to have a moderate diffuse
dilation of the common bile duct with some sludge, measuring
about 12
millimeters and this is why he had a stent placed
successfully in the common bile duct.  Subsequently this
stent was removed but in spite of this his bilirubin never
returned to [**Location 213**] values and remained elevated.

His Intensive Care Unit course was subsequently complicated
by prolonged intubation, ultimately requiring a tracheostomy
that was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] from Interventional
Pulmonology on [**2110-11-12**].  The patient tolerated this
procedure well and this tracheostomy allowed the surgical
Intensive Care Unit staff to perform much better pulmonary
toilet.

By the beginning of [**Month (only) **], he was tolerating trials of
trach mask with on and off episodes of hypotension.  He was
intermittently on and off pressors to treat this hypotension
during this time . He was started on enteral tube feeding as well
as kept on total parenteral nutrition, closing monitoring
transferrin levels as well as liver function tests.

During the entire month of [**Month (only) **], the patient appeared to
wax and wane but ultimately became progressively sicker and
deteriorated.  His liver function tests never improved and
progressively his renal function worsened.  He developed
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and he was growing
Pseudomonas from his sputum.

The family was approached and informed repeated times about
the seriousness of his condition and the likely poor
prognosis of his postoperative course.  Despite this, the
patient's family wished to continue full support and keep him
in the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

He continued to decline and progressively became sicker and
more pressor dependent to keep adequate hemodynamics.  Upon
meeting with the Surgical Intensive Care Unit staff and in
agreement with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the vascular attending on
record, it was decided that cardiopulmonary resuscitation
would not be indicated on this patient, but he will be kept
on the pressor support as well as ventilatory support as the
patient's family wished.

By the evening of [**2110-12-11**], he was more acidotic and
minimally responsive with low blood pressure requiring a full
ventilatory support to barely keep his saturations above the
90s.  By the next day, on [**2110-12-12**], in the morning,
he was hypotensive, hypothermic, despite our support with
Dopamine, Levophed, and full ventilatory support.

By mid afternoon, the patient's monitor alarm went off and he
was noted to be asystolic.  The Primary Team was called to
evaluate the patient and upon confirming the absence of
corneal reflexes, tracheal reflex as well as a lack of
spontaneous breathing or heart rate, nor any response to
painful stimuli he was pronounced dead at 03:35 pm on
[**2110-12-12**].

The patient's family was notified as well as the covering
staff p
