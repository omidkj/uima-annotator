STUDIES
CTA chest [**2117-10-22**]
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Coronary artery
calcifications are
noted. Otherwise, the heart and pericardium are unremarkable
without
pericardial effusion. There is no evidence for pulmonary
embolism. There are enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, with right
paratracheal lymph nodes measuring up to 17 mm in short axis.
Aortopulmonary window lymph nodes
measure up to 10 mm in short axis. There is a small right
pleural effusion associated with bibasilar atelectasis. There
are scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules. For example, in the
right upper lobe (3:3), a nodule measures 4 mm. Also within the
right upper lobe (3:26), a nodule measures 5 mm. Within the
right middle lobe (3:34), a nodule measures 5 mm. Within the
right lower lobe are several peripherally located nodules, the
largest measuring up to 5 mm. The largest nodule in the left
upper lobe (3:14) measures up to 7 mm. There is diffuse
interlobular septal thickening, suggestive of mild pulmonary
edema. Perihilar ground-glass opacities also likely reflect
volume overload. Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal
bilateral renal cysts, with a right renal cyst measuring up to
2.8 cm and a left renal cyst measuring up to 2.5 cm. Colonic
diverticulosis is partially imaged.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout
the thoracic spine with large anterior osteophytes.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffuse interlobular septal thickening with perihilar
ground-glass
opacities, likely reflective of volume overload. Associated tiny
right
pleural effusion.
3. Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules. A close interval
follow-up Chest CT in 3 months is recommended given a history of
prostate cancer, as these
nodules may reflect metastases.
.
TEE [**10-23**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is moderately depressed left ventricular
function (LVEF = 30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Emergency study by fellow.
Moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function. Please
see same day full study for details
.
TEE/cardioversion [**10-25**]
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The right atrial appendage ejection velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. LV systolic function appears depressed. with
borderline normal right ventricular free wall function. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets
