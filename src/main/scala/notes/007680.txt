Per EGD report pt was incidentally found to have a follicular
lymphoma in the 2nd part of the duodenum adjacent to, but not
directly involving, the ampulla during an EGD [**2163-2-8**]. Pt had
initially presented w/unresolving symptoms of reflux Work-up for
metastatic disease was negative (CT, PET, bone marrow bx). Pt
underwent last EGD with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64304**] [**2163-3-11**]-he re-biopsied an
area of white granular mucosal nodularity, which was negative
for lymphoma, as were biopsies of 3rd portion of duodenum beyond
the lymphoma.
.
On the transfer, initial vs were: T 95 P 90 BP 161/83 R 21 O2
sat 96% and pt intubated. When arrived, pt had cuff leak and was
able to be extubated. Throat feels scratchy but otherwise

HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,

Pertinent Results:
EGD
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Localized discontinuous white, granular, nodularity in
a patchy distribution was noted in the area of the papilla.
Three endoclips were successfully applied to the papilla major
for the purpose of radiation therapy mapping. An small patch of
white, granular tissue was noted in the mid-jejunum. Cold
forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the
mid-jejunum.
Impression: Granularity, nodularity, and white patchy in the
area of the papilla consistent with previous biospy results that
indicated lymphoma.
 A very tiny, 1mm, white, granular patch in the mid-jejunum;
biopsy of this area was performed.
Three [**Company 2267**] resolution clips were placed around the
area of nodularity at the level of the entrum.  One clip was
place proximal, one distal and another in between to triangulate
the area.
Otherwise normal enteroscopy to third part of the duodenum.

Recommendations: Follow up with your [**Company 5564**] and radiation
[**Company 5564**] for planned therapy.
Plan discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64304**] prior to procedure. He will
notify radiation [**Last Name (STitle) 5564**] that clipping has been performed.

to PACU for observation and later extubation.  Husband was
called an informed of the need to intubate for the exam and the
above findings were explained to him.

Estimated blood loss = zero. Specimens were taken for pathology
as listed above.
