Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
68F with a history of CAD, s/p stents, who has chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-8-22**] - CABGx4(LIMA->LAD, SVG->Ramus, RCA, PLV)/MV repair(24mm
CE physio annuloplasty band)
[**2187-8-15**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
This 68F was admitted on [**2187-8-14**] with 3 days of chest pain.  The
pain occurred with rest and exertion and was exacerbated by
smoking.  It was not relieved with SL NTG and she presented to
the ER at [**Hospital3 **].  She did not have EKG
changes, but had troponin of 1.08 and was started on a heparin
drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
The EKG in the ER here, showed ST depressions in V3-V4 and an
old q wave in V3.  She was started on Integrillin and admitted
to the floor. A cardiac catheterization was performed which
revealed severe coronary artery disease and the cardiac surgery
service was consulted for surgical management.

Past Medical History:
CAD- s/p MI in [**2182**], s/p stent placed in the ramus in [**2181**] and 2
stents to the RCA in [**2182**]. Ramus stent was occluded at that
time.

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2187-8-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolution of small left-sided pneumothorax.
2. New small bilateral pleural effusions and increased left
lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Removal of right IJ catheter sheath.

[**2187-8-22**] ECHO
Pt with h/o nissen fundoplication. Probe placed easily and used
only in upper and mid esophagus. No transgastric views obtained.
Wall motion assesment incomplete and relied only on mid
esophageal views.

Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is
elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left
ventricle is not well seen. Based only on mid esophageal veiws,
there appears to be severe inferior and posterior hypokinesis
akinesis, lateral mild hypokinesis . Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed, LVEF 30-40%. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. Epiaortic scan reveals no significant plaque visible
in the area of the planned cross clamp or cannulation.

Post bypass: Patient is on infusions of epinepherine,
nitroglycerin, and
phenylepherine. Pt was initally av paced, then sinus for later
images. Overall LV function remains 30-40% with unchanged wall
motion. There is a mitral annuloplasty ring insitu. There is no
residual mitral regurgitation. Mitral gradients are 6-8 mm Hg
peak, 2-3 mm Hg mean. Aortic contours remain intact. All other
findings are unchanged. All findings were discussed with the
surgeons at the time of the exam.

[**2187-8-15**] Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had 40% proximal and 50% mid vessel
stenoses.
There was a large D2 (twin LAD) that had a 80% stenosis at its
origin.
The LCx had a 100% mid vessel lesion.  The RI had a long 99% in
stent
restenosis. The RCA had a complex 95% mid-vessel in-stent
restenosis and
an occluded PDA which filled via left to right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics elevated left-sided pressures
with an
LVEDP of 26 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed 3+ mitral regurgitation.  The
LVEF was
calculated to be 40% with inferior wall akinesis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11519**] was admitted and was loaded with 600mg of Plavix
and started on Integrilin and heparin. She underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2187-8-15**] which revealed: an 80% LAD lesion at
the origin of the second diagonal, 100% LCX stenosis, a 99%
ramus in-stent restenosis, a 95% RCA mid in-stent restenosis,
and occluded PDA lesion. She also had 3+ MR and an LVEF of 40%.
Given the severity of her disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was consulted for
surgical evaluation. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner and scheduled surgery however needed to wait several days
for her plavix load to washed out. On [**2187-8-22**], Ms. [**Known lastname 11519**] was
taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to four vessel and a mitral valve repair
utilizing a 24mm CE Physio annuloplasty ring. Please see
operative note for details. She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 11519**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin, beta blockade
and a statin were resumed. Plavix was started for poor targets.
On postoperative day two, Ms. [**Known lastname 11519**] was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. Her drains and pacing wires were removed per protocol
without complication. Ms. [**Known lastname 11519**] developed a sinus headache
and Nasonex, Flovent and azithromycin were started with good
effect. Ms. [**Known lastname 11519**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day eight. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], her cardiologist and her primary care
physician as an outpatient. An ace inhibitor should be resumed
as an outpatient when her blood pressure can tolerate.
