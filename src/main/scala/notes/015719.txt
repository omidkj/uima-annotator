History of Present Illness:
86 yo female with med hx of DMII, HTN, CRI who presented to OSH
with tonic clonic seizures in the setting of glucose of 500 and
markedly positive UA then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Pt lives alone
in [**Location (un) **] and was found down by her neighbor.  EMS found pt
propped up in chair incotinent of urine and stool and brought
her to OSH. At OSH pt had witnessed tonic clonic seizure which
resolve with 2mg Ativan and was intubated for severe metabolic
and respiratory acidoses.  ABG at OSH was 6.8/68/436 and wet
read on head Head CT was neg. ECG revealed lateral TWI with
first set of CE neg. In ED here her ABG was 7.42/26/486 with VSS
and she was continued on IV levofloxacin and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was intubated and sedated.
She has since been extubated, and is satting well on O2 via NC.
During her ICU course, the patient had a CT of the head showing
a mass vs. infarction and the neurology service has been
following.  An MRI of the brain was done today, and is pending.
An EEG has also been ordered to look for a seizure focus.  In
addition, the patient has begun to rule in for an MI with
+troponin, although EKG is unchanged.
.
On admission, the patient was A&O x 3.  She denied CP/SOB, N/V,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, HA, dizziness, or F/C.

Pertinent Results:
MICRO DATA -
Sputum ([**4-23**]): GPC, GPR
Blood cx: pndg
CSF cx: negative
Urine cx: negative
.
RADIOLOGY -
CT CHEST ([**4-23**])
1.  8 mm calcified nodule in the posterior segment of right
upper lobe, which probably representing calcified granuloma as
noted in the prior chest x-ray.
2.  3 mm noncalcified granuloma in the right upper lobe.  Please
follow up in 1 year if this patient has no history of
malignancy.
3.  Small bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis and linear
scarring.
4.  Coronary artery calcifications.
5.  Cystic lesions in the liver, measuring 8 hounsfield units,
probably representing liver cysts.
6. 10 mm pretracheal lymphadenopathy.
.
CT HEAD ([**4-22**])
Ill-defined abnormal attenuation involving the right insula and
frontal lobe with mild associated mass effect and loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.  This appearance could be consistent
with infarction with mild hemorrhage, or a neoplasm,
particularly lymphoma, which may appear hyperdense. The
differential includes other neoplastic or infectious processes.
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo female with a past medical history of DMII, HTN, CRI who
presented to an OSH with tonic clonic seizures in the setting of
glucose of 500 and markedly positive UA, then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further managment.  She has since stabilized and
is being transferred to the floor.
.
1) SEIZURE - The patient had tonic clonic seizures on
presentation to the OSH.  It was felt unikely for this 86 y/o pt
to have new onset epilepsy at this age, so imaging and an LP
were performed; the LP did not show an infectious process, yet
an MRI showed a questionable acute or sub-acute infarct.  An EEG
demonstrated an epileptogenic focus in the same area as this
questionable infarct.  Neurology was consulted and felt that she
did not require anti-epileptics and that anticoagulation (for
her atrial fibrillation, as described below) should be held in
the acute setting and would be re-evaluated after a repeat head
CT.  The patient had no subsequent seizures throughout the
remainder of the admission, but after initial concern for
hypoglycemia and hyponatremia lowering her threshold, decision
was made to start Keppra, which she is tolerating well.
2) NSTEMI - Cardiac enzymes were checked at admission and were
elevated (CK 522, MB 8, Tn .16); her ECG showed anterolateral ST
depressions.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 410**] [**Name (STitle) 59297**] for MI, and her CK peaked at
1060 on the third day of admission and subsequently declined.
Her troponin reached 1.86 at the time and also declined, though
bumped again in the setting of rapid afib (see below) to 3.64
and then declined; this exaggerated bump and slow decline was
felt to be secondary to her renal insufficiency.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 410**]
and her family decided she did not want to undergo cardiac
catheterization, so her medical management was maximized; there
was a debate as to how this should be managed in light of the
question of CVA on MRI, but it was felt that acute
anticoagulation for the NSTEMI was of greater importance.
Initially, she was on a heparin drip, but this was stopped as
her enzyme levels declined.  In addition to the heparin, she was
kept on an aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol (with
a goal heart rate of 55-60), and lisinopril.  She denied chest
pain throughout the admission.  ECG's were followed and showed
some resolution of the ST depression by then end of the
admission.  An echo was checked that demonstrated an EF of
35-40%; ant
