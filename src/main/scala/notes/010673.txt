Shortness of breath, productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
65 yoF with history of AF not on coumadin due to h/o GI bleed,
dCHF, AS (area 1-1.2cm2), pulmonary HTN & OSA, morbid obesity,
drug resistant PNAs, asthma/COPD s/p multiple intubations on 2L
home O2, who presented [**2197-12-24**] with 2-3 days of worsening SOB,
productive cough and 1 day of AMS, was intubated and admitted to
the ICU in hypercarbic respiratory failure due to PNA &
decompensated dCHF, was extubated [**2197-12-27**], and is now being
transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management of dCHF
decompensation.
.
She was discharged from rehab about 2 weeks prior to
presentation and according to the patient she was doing well.
After discharge from rehab, her baseline was being able to walk
from her bed to the kitchen without being significantly short of
breath - about 150ft. She noticed a marked decline in her
physical capacity 2-3 days prior to admission - about 10-15ft to
the bathroom made her SOB.
.
She endorses sick contacts - her brother came to visit about a
week prior to presentation and subsequently developed URI
symptoms. Otherwise, she notes no medicine non-adherence or
dietary indiscretion, but say that she occasionally eats canned
vegetables, but this has not changed as of late. She denies any
recent history of chest pain or palpitations.
.
IN THE ED, vital signs were 96.6   110   122/86   24   94 on 4L
NC, with ABG 7.24/90/72/41 with CXR showing bilateral
infiltrates and pulmonary edema. Respiratory distress worsened
and repeat ABG was 7.18/107/89/42 at which point she was
intubated and transferred to the ICU.
.
IN THE ICU, her respiratory status improved in the ICU. Was
diuresed on a lasix gtt + metolazone from an admission weight of
141.7kg to 133.7kg ([**Location 10226**]13.8L)on transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**]. For her PNA
she received vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin; vancomycin
& azithromycin stopped because cultures grew out GNRs;
transferred on meropenem to end [**12-28**]. She was also started on a
steroid pulse - methylprednisolone 125 mg IV q8h tapered to 80
IV q8h over 3 days; transitioned to Prednisone 40 mg daily with
taper planned to 10 mg [**12-29**]. Noted to have leukopenia, ID
consulted, and presume it to be related to antibiotics.
.
IN THE ICU prior to transfer, vital signs were 98   92 (Afib)
107/66   20   100 3L NC. Last ABG at 0400 was 7.49/74/113/58.
