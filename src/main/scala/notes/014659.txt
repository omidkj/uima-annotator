CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85 year-old gentleman
who was initially hospitalized here on [**2176-6-23**] to [**2176-6-24**] for
a diagnostic CT angiogram determination of aortic aneurysm
repair. Patient has a known abdominal aortic aneurysm for 4
years. It is difficult to assess by interview and follow-up.
Although the most recent ultrasound showed an aneurysm of 5
to 7 cm. Patient is asymptomatic. Because of his renal
insufficiency, he was admitted for rehydration and
arteriogram. Completed the study without difficulty and was
discharged to home to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]. He had an
elective surgical date for aortic repair on [**2176-7-8**]. In the
interim, the patient was hospitalized at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 36688**] Hospital
for complete heart block which required a pacemaker
implantation and a gastrointestinal bleed requiring
transfusion. The patient required intubation during this
period of time. He was extubated on [**2176-7-6**] and transferred to
our institution for anticipated repair. Since the interval
being seen, he denies any chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, back pain, melena, hematemesis or weakness.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovastatin 10 mg daily.  Plavix 75 mg daily.
Tamsulosin .4 mg capsules daily. Cortisone .1 mg daily.
Ipromium bromide inhalations daily.  Disopyramide 150 mg
sustained tablets q. 12 hours. Paroxetine 12.5 mg sustained
released.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg q. 24 hours for 3 doses for
urinary tract infection.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Coreg 3.125 mg daily.  Cleocin 600
mg IV q. 8 hours.  Rocephin 1 gram q. 24 hours. Norpace.

complete heart block in [**7-7**] requiring a permanent pacemaker.
Coronary artery stenting in [**2174**] x3. Previous coronary artery
bypass grafting x3 in [**2165**].  History of cardiac arrhythmias
on Norpace.  History of colon cancer, status post AP
resection with colostomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired, 72, is the former
vice president of a company. He lives with his wife
and ambulates independently.  Habit wise, he is a former
smoker and has not smoked for 20 years.  Prior to that, it
was a pack per day. He started at the age of 16. He admits to
occasional beer, maybe 6 a year.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 96.6; 76, 22, blood
pressure 149/66.  Oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 liters.
General appearance: Alert and oriented x3 in no acute
distress.  Skin exam was without rashes, ecchymosis or
jaundice. HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Carotids are palpable
without bruit. The lungs are diminished at the bases. There
was no adventitial sounds. Excursion is equal. Heart is
regular rate and rhythm without rub. Abdomen:  Soft,
reducible ventral hernia. No abdominal bruits. No palpable
masses.  Colostomy stoma is pink.  There is a right groin
mass which is mobile.  Pulse exam shows carotids are palpable
bilaterally 1+, radials are palpable 2+, femorals are
palpable 2+, popliteals are palpable 2+.  DP and PT are
palpable and 1+.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU.
Gastric lavage was negative. He was continued on the
Protonix. EP was requested to see the patient and interrogate
the pacemaker.  Nasogastric was placed to suction. He was
given maintenance fluids.  He remained in the VICU.  On
hospital day number 2, there were no overnight events. His
admitting hematocrit was 30.3; BUN 29; creatinine 1.8;
albumin 3.0; coags INR of 1.7.  The nasogastric tube was
discontinued. He was continued on his Protonix and
subcutaneous heparin was started.  Patient's urine culture
was negative and attempt for a sputum culture was of no
avail. Culture sent was consistent with upper respiratory
secretions.

Chest x-ray after IJ placement showed moderate cardiomegaly
which is chronic mild pulmonary vasculature engorgement which
is stable. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
The nasogastric tube ended in the upper stomach and the tip
of the right subclavicular central venous line projected over
the right atrium.  The right ventricular transvenous pacer
lines and new left pectoral pacemaker projects over the
cavity of the right ventricle rather than the floor. There is
no pneumothorax or appreciable pleura.

The gastrointestinal service was consulted because of the
hematemesis and anemia to determine whether there may be a
gastrointestinal source of bleeding or AV fistulization from
his aneurysm. The patient underwent an upper endoscopy on
[**2176-7-7**].  A small hiatal hernia was noted. There was partially
digested food in the body and fundus of the stomach. There
was diffuse continuous erythema. The mucosa was not bleeding
in the whole stomach, greater in the antrum.  Findings were
compatible with mild gastritis.  Duodenum had continuous
erythematous mucosa with no bleeding noted in the duodenal
bulb, compatible with duodenitis. Second portion of the
duodenum was clean without evidence of fresh or old blood. No
obvious source was identified for the patient's reported
hematemesis although this may have been due to his
esophagitis and gastritis.

Recommendations were to continue a PPI twice daily for a
total of 30 days and there were no contraindications for
anticoagulation if indicated at surgery. The patient
underwent on [**2176-7-8**], an open abdominal aortic repair with an
aorta bifemoral graft, a ventral hernia repair and lysis of
abdominal adhesions. The patient tolerated the procedure
well. He was transferred to the PACU in stable condition,
intubated. He received 4 units of packed red blood cells
intraoperatively and 1000 cc of red blood cells from the cell
[**Doctor Last Name 10105**]. He also received 4.5 liters of ringers lactate.
Postoperatively, hematocrit remained stable with 30.7, BUN
24; creatinine 1.2.  CE was negative. His blood gas was 7.33,
46, 170, 25. Patient could not be extubated, therefore, he
was transferred to the ICU for respiratory support. He was
seen by EP who interrogated his pacemaker and found it be
working appropriately.  Postoperative day number 2, he
continued to be n.p.o. Nasogastric tube remained in place
until the patient's respiratory status improved and he was
extubated. His hematocrit remained stable. Postoperative day
three, there were no overnight events. The patient was
extubated. He remained n.p.o. and continued with respiratory
pulmonary toiletry. He was stable on Carvedilol and he had
good response to the Lasix. Aldactone 25 mg daily was
instituted.  His hematocrit remained stable. He was
considered for transfer to the VICU or floor on postoperative
day number 3. He was evaluated by physical therapy.
Recommended that the patient be discharged to rehab to
address impairment and progress patient's mobility.
Postoperative day number 5, the patient received a unit of
packed cells for a hematocrit of 27.6.  A KUB was obtained
and that was negative for any obstructive pattern and sips
were instituted.  Ambulation to chair was begun. The patient
remained in the VICU. The patient was transferred to the
regular nursing floor on postoperative day number #[**Serial Number **].
Physical therapy continued to work with him. The patient
still had intermittent episodes of confusion, mostly at night
but did not require a sitter. Diet was advanced as tolerated.
Patient was known to have candidiasis of the perineal area
and his urinalysis showed a yeast infection. Fluconazole was
instituted for 3 days.  Patient had a right groin lymphocele
drainage and a colostomy bag was placed over that to collect
the fluid.
