Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedics was consulted
given his injuries; managed initially in traction until
hemodynamically stable. He was taken to the operating room
several days later for repair of his acetabular fracture; there
were no intraoperative complications. He did experience pain
control issues; initially refusing to take narcotics. He also
refused to work with Physical therapy because of his pain. After
many discussions  he did eventually agree to take narcotics;
started out with short acting narcotics and eventually added
long acting narcotics with better control. He was able to then
work better with Physical and Occupational therapy. Wound care
nurse was also consulted for wound on his foot; Accuzyme was
recommended. He will follow up with Orthopedics in 2 weeks for
removal of staples and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his foot
ulcer in 2 weeks.
