Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
"occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
right [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] field cut"


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 12067**] is a 70 year old right-handed female with a
history of coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, asthma and
right occipital hemorrhage ([**2149**]) from amyloid angiopathy who
now
presents with headache and vision loss.  Yesterday ([**2-8**])
afternoon while doing some strenuous yardwork (cutting/hauling
branches) she developed a bilateral dull headache with the left
side being more intense sharp pain than the right side.  She
then
noticed that her left eye seemed to be "frozen."  Thereafter,
she
says that she lost vision in her left eye and began bumping into
furniture.  She did not want to go to the hospital yesterday.
Headache persisted this morning and she took aspirin 81mg
without
relief.  She also developed some nausea but no weakness, no
sensory changes or confusion.

She eventually agreed to be taken to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital
today where head CT showed a left occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage without any midline shift or herniation.  She was
given IV dilaudid and reglan and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further care.  In the ED, initial blood pressure was 121/72 and
she was given IV zofran, morphine and tylenol.  Neurology was
consulted for further management.

On neuro ROS, the pt endorses dull bilateral headache, loss of
vision in her left eye, no blurred vision, no diplopia, no
dysarthria, no dysphagia.  No vertigo, no tinnitus or hearing
difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending
speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness or parasthesiae. No
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.  No unsteadiness
with
ambulation but is bumping into walls/furniture.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. No cough
or shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  No nausea or vomiting.  No diarrhea,
constipation.
No abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

-right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage (biopsy confirmed
amyloid angiopathy)-brought on by vigorous snow shoveling.

Social History:
Lives with daughter, granddaughter, grandson.  Used to
work in a factory.  Smoked 1ppd her entire life until yesterday

ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities most noticably in
the
anterolateral leads. Cannot rule out underlying myocardial
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2149-2-18**]
anterolateral ST-T wave changes persist. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

[**2153-2-8**] NCHCT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension
into the
extra-axial space. Mild-to-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema
and sulcal and left lateral ventricle effacement. Slight
effacement of the left ambient cistern is noted but with overall
relatively little mass effect.
2. New but chronic-appeearing focus of encephalomalacia in the
left anterior frontal lobe.

EEG:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Occasional bursts of right posterior quadrant
[**2-23**] Hz
delta frequency activity were seen.
ABNORMALITY #2: In the most electrographically awake-appearing
portions
of this tracing, a symmetric 7-7.5 Hz theta frequency background
was
seen.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as the patient was
unable to
cooperate.
