Center on [**2185-6-29**] and taken to the operating room with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for an AVR with#21 CE tissue valve.  Please see operative
note for full details.  She was transferred to the ICU in stable
condition and was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation her first post operative day.  She was transferred
from the ICU to the regular floor on POD#1.  She developed
atrial fibrillation on POD#2 and was started on amiodarone.
With the amiodarone and Lopressor she developed bradycardia and
the Lopressor was discontinued.  On POD#4 she was noted to have
an elevated creatinine to 2.4 and was given PRBC and IV fluids
and her Lasix was held. On POD#5 she was again noted to have
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and an
electrophysiology consult was obtained.  It was recommended that
the amiodarone be discontinued, patient start on anticoagulation
and the heart rate be controlled with Lopressor.  She converted
to sinus rhythm on POD#6, however her INR had risen rapidly to
4.2 with 2 doses of Coumadin.  Her Coumadin was discontinued per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her aspirin was increased to 325 mg.  Her
