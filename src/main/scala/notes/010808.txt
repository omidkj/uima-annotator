Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 49 year old F with multiple medical complications
including a urostomy, recurrent UTI, and chronic abodminal pain
with multiple abdominal surgeries who presents w/ 4 days of
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain and 3 days of diarrhea.
In the ED, patient described her pain as most severe in
epigastrum, radiating to LUQ and RUQ. The pain is similar to
prior episodes of abdominal pain, but more severe this episode.
Her last reported BM was this morning, non-bloody and loose. She
denied f/c and is not sexually active. Pt was admitted 2+ months
ago s/p ERCP for choledocholithasis and last month for UTI,
presented with similar complaints. Notably, due to multiple
severe allergies to antibiotics, she required 5 days of
aztreonam for her last UTI.
Initial vs were 97.7, 60, 107/87, 16, 99%RA. Initial labs were
remarkable for plt of 60K and grossly positive UA. She received
morphine and reglan for pain and nausea, and aztreonam for her
UTI. Due to persistent pain, she underwent unremarkable
abdominal CT scan. She was admitted to medicine for further
management.
On arrival to the floor, patient appears acutely ill and is
groaning in pain. She is a very difficult historian, and reports
'all over' abdominal pain. She reports feeling feverish, but
denies SOB or cough. She notes signficant nausea and emesis, and
inability to take po for several days. She is unable to provide
additional ROS.

Imaging:
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2179-9-28**] (no oral or IV contrast)
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:
Included views of the lung bases demonstrate mild dependent
atelectasis.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.  The heart is
mildly enlarged.

Focal hepatic steatosis lies adjacent to the falciform ligament
(2:21).
Remainder of the liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen,
adrenal glands, stomach and intra-abdominal small bowel are
normal. Intramuralfat deposition is seen within the right and
transverse colon, but theremainder of the colon appears
unremarkable.  Common bile duct dilatation to 11 mm is
unchanged, and no intra-hepatic biliary dilatation is grossly
noted.

The patient is post ileal conduit diversion via a right lower
quadrant stoma,with no evidence of obstruction.  There is
expected mild bilateral ureteraldistension and renal
pelviectasis, but no hydronephosis is present.  Corticalthinning
along the posterior right kidney (2:26) is unchanged since the
[**Month (only) 205**] [**Numeric Identifier 109842**] examination, likely noting prior infectious or
vascular insult.

CT OF THE PELVIS:
The rectum, sigmoid colon, and intrapelvic small large bowel are
unremarkable.Fibroid uterus is redemonstrated.  Fecalized
material within the left pelvis(2: 73) is unchanged from prior
examinations.  There is no intrapelvic freefluid or
lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:
Dysmorphic pelvic, spina bifida, and a sacral meningiocele are
again seen
(2:50). There are no bony lesions concerning for malignancy or
infection.
Cerclage wires surround the proximal femurs bilaterally (2: 80).


IMPRESSION: No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.

Abdominal Ultrasound [**2179-9-29**]
FINDINGS:  Liver is homogeneous in echotexture without discrete
masses or
lesions.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation withthe common bile duct measuring 4 mm.  A large
shadowing stone is identified inthe gallbladder neck.  The
patient was unable to participate in positionchanges to allow
assessment for gallstone mobility.  No evidence ofcholecystitis
present; specifically, there is no gallbladder
distention,gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid.  The
midline including thepancreas and proximal aorta are obscured by
gas.  The demonstrated portions ofthe right kidn
