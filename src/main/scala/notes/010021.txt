Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for evaluation of b/l carotid stenoses (s/p L
ICA stent) for CEA vs. angioplasty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] is a 72 yo RH woman with history of CHF (EF 30%), afib
on coumadin, ESRD on HD (now daily), DM II, HL, HTN, COPD who
initially presented to BIDN where she was found to have a L ACA
infarct and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of b/l
carotid stenoses (s/p L ICA stent) for CEA vs. angioplasty.
Patient initially presented to BIDN on [**8-9**] with right leg
weakness.  Pt states that she spent the morning shopping for
clothing with her daughter.  When they came home, she sat down
in the bed.  On attempt to stand up, she could not move her
legs. She does not recall weakness in arms, difficulty with
speech, loss of sensation, difficulty swallowing, headache.  At
BIDN, patient ws seen by neurology.  NIHSS was 6.  She had right
hemeparesis, leg > arm. Her mental status was intact.  She was
found to have L ACA infarct, most likely cardioembolic in
setting of afib and subtherapeutic INR.  She also had small
hemorrhage on CT.  So, aspirin was decreased from 325 to 81, and
her coumadin was held. Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] has known 80-99% stenosis of
the Right ICA as well as bilateral ECA stenoses. Now, on the
Left, she has multiple near-occlusive placques in the distal,
extracranial ICA (per carotid U/S and MRA from BIN
7/19-22/[**2204**]),distal to her stent.  Given her multiple medical
problems, including ESRD and complicated cardiac history, she is
quite high risk for operative intervention.  She was transferred
here for further evaluation.

Patient's admission at BIDN was quite complicated medically.
She had an acute CHF exacerbation in setting of dietary
indiscretion as well as noncompliance with dialysis.  Pt was
transiently in the ICU on bipap.  She was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4135**] in
house, who is her primary cardiologist.  Lasix was increased
from 40mg PO qd to 80mg PO qd.  Dialysis was initiated.  During
admission, pt also had chest pain with ST depressions in II, II,
aVF.  Trops peaked at 0.1.  Deferred heparin drip given large
territory ACA stroke.

Renal whise, pt has ESRD and was on HD 3x/week.  However, the
patient
refused HD in the past 2 weeks. The patient is also noncompliant
with her diet.  She was dialyzed in BIDN.  She was seen by
neprhology, recommended Epogen.  Of note, she has fired
physicians in the past.

Pt was found to have Urinary tract infection with Escherichia
coli sensitive to ceftriaxone.  Day #1 was [**8-13**].

Today, pt feels somewhat better.  Her husband is present.  Feels
that her speech is "not as clear as usual."  Apparently, earlier
in the day, she was able to move her right leg but now cannot.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia,lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent denies chest
pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.   No dysuria.

*****************

Imaging:
Studies at OSH:
-Chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema.
Head CT revealed no evidence of acute infarction; however,
clinical
indication with MRI was recommended.

-Brain MRI with MRA revealed acute infarction in the left
anterior
cerebral artery territory with a small discontinuous focus of
infarction in the left posterior body at all lobes with
associated blood products indicating focal hemorrhagic
transformation.
Motion limited head MRA with probable atherosclerosis involving
the right middle cerebral artery distal branches.
Neck MRA was a motion limited study with questionable filling
defects in the proximal right and left internal carotid
arteries.
