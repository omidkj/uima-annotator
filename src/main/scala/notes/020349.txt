Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, chest burning

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75 yo F with PMH of DM2, HTN, distant CVA now presenting with
SOB and chest burning x 1 day. She presented to [**Hospital **] hospital
today after waking up with SOB and some chest burning primarily
across the anterior left part of her chest. Rated sensation as
[**5-29**]. Per pt she has never had this before.
.
She states she's noticed increased lower extremity swelling over
the last week. Additionally, her daughters note that she has
been occasionally disoriented over the last several weeks which
is not her baseline. Patient states that she felt like her
thinking has been 'fuzzy' over the last 2 days.
.
After experiencing the chest burning, her daughter noticed that
she was gurgling as she talked and EMS was called. They noted on
arrival that her sats were mid- 70s. She was placed on NRB, and
improved to the mid-90s. Burning was releived with SL nitro in
the field, down to 0/10. At OSH ED, she received a 600cc fluid
bolus, but then received ? 40 + 20 mg of IV lasix after deciding
she was in CHF. Also recieved 162mg ASA, sL nitro and 0.5" inch
of nitropaste. Noted to be in ARF with K of 6.1, for which she
received kayexylate. Foley was placed and put out 300cc. ABG was
7.37/32/90/18 on 100% FiO2. Patient placed on CPAP with good
effect. The BiPAP was titrated off at 1:30PM but sats dropped to
92% so re-started. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 99.5 91 143/78 18 94-95% on. She
was noted to have rales but trace peripheral edema on exam. Labs
revealed elevated WBC ct to 12.4 but no bandemia. Was noted to
have ARF to 3.4 and pro BNP elevated to 10,238. A CXR was
performed which was revealing for interval development of
bilateral pleural effusions, also new hilar prom c/w CHF,
possible retrocardiac density seen. EKG showed NSR, no peaked T
waves, but ? <1mm in V3-V5, I, II. First set of CE's revealed
flat CKs with elevated trop to 0.05 in the setting of ARF.
Lactate and U/A were normal. Spiked a temp of 100.8 in ED. Blood
and urine cultures were sent, she received vanc 1g, CTX 1g,
levoquin 750mg, tylenol, and morphine. She was placed on BiPAP
and a nitro gtt and was admitted to the CCU for presumed CHF
exacerbation +/- PNA. Foley had put out an additional 700cc
prior to transfer, when most recent VS were temp 100.8 (not
rechecked since tmax) HR 99 BP 150/49 22 99% on CPAP.
.
On review of systems, she reports a prior history of stroke over
10 years ago, denies deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She does report recent
chills though she states she is ofte cold. Denies recent fevers,
or rigors. She endorses exertional buttock or calf pain and
reports a prior hx of PVD. Additionally, she reports
intermittent diarrhea which has been life long. Finally, she
reports pain in her lower back ad thing where she fell 2 days
ago. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac
review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
She does endorse a fall yesterday for which she had a head
laceration sutured (2 stitches). A CT head at that time was
negative per family report.

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2171-5-12**]):  Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality
although is nondiagnostic. Nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Since
previous tracing of [**2162-3-1**], sinus tachycardia rate slower.

CXR 1V ([**2171-5-12**]):  Findings compatible with congestive heart
failure. Left retrocardiac density also noted and pneumonia is
therefore considered. Recommend correlation with lateral view to
further assess.

CXR 2V ([**2171-5-13**]):  Small right and moderate left pleural
effusion are unchanged allowing the differences in positioning
of the patient. Increased retrocardiac opacities likely
atelectasis. No other interval change.

TTE ([**2171-5-14**]):  The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Impaired left ventricular relaxation. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Minimal aortic stenosis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2166-7-16**], there is minimal aortic stenosis.
Borderline elevated pulmonary artery pressures are slightly
higher.
