Chief Complaint:
Anuria, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AV pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 yo female with h/o solitary kidney with
renal artery stenosis with CRI (baseline cr 3.8) who has not
seen MD since [**9-15**].  Patient was in her usual state of health
until the last few days before admission, when she began having
severe diarrhea.  She reports several days of watery diarrhea,
and attributes this to eating a "bad egg."  She denies any
melena/BRBPR.  The patient also noticed decreased urine output
and anuria for last 2 days prior to admission.  She also felt
increasingly fatigued and had loss of apptite prior to
admission.  She reports some weight loss as well.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] also
reports an episode of chest pain at rest the night before
admission.  This pain resolved spontaneously.  She could not
characterize it as sharp or dull, but does report that she felt
like her heart was racing during the episode of pain.

CXR ([**2158-8-5**]):
PORTABLE AP CHEST: No prior studies are available for
comparison. The heart
size is within normal limits given the AP technique and
rotation. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is increased
prominence of the
pulmonary vasculature with [**Last Name (un) 16765**]-B lines, indicative of
congestive heart
failure. The aorta is calcified. Linear areas of atelectasis or
scarring are
seen in the left mid-lung laterally, and in the left lower lobe.
Osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with fluid overload/CHF. No
evidence of
pneumonia.
***
CXR ([**2158-8-6**]):
IMPRESSION: No significant changes in the degree of bilateral
pulmonary
vascular congestion is noted. The left pleural effusion is
slightly larger at
this time.
***
RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**2158-8-6**]):
No prior studies are available for comparison. The patient
states she has had a nonfunctioning left kidney for multiple
years.
The right kidney measures 8.4 cm, and the left measures 6.7 cm.
Both kidneys
are markedly echogenic consistent with chronic medical renal
disease. There is
no hydronephrosis. Within the left kidney are two small cysts,
the larger of
which is located in the lower pole, measuring 13 mm in greatest
dimension.
Incidentally noted are multiple gallstones within the
gallbladder, which is
nondistended, and does not demonstrate wall thickening or
pericholelcystic
fluid collection. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary duct
dilatation,
with the common bile duct measuring 3 mm.
IMPRESSION: Echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal
disease. No
evidence of renal obstruction.
***
ECHO/TTE ([**2158-8-7**]):
The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Venous Duplex Mapping
CONCLUSION: Preoperative evaluation before creation of an
arteriovenous dialysis fistula:
1. patency of the single bilateral brachial arteries at the
level of the arms, and of the left subclavian artery;
2. presence of the dialysis catheter in the right subclavian
vein;
3. presence of clot in the right basilic and left cephalic
veins. The widest available vein is the left basilic vein. The
right cephalic vein is patent as well, although smaller
(especially in the right arm).


Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL SERVICE COURSE: Pt was admitted to the MICU for
treatment of Progression to ESRD requiring HD and atrial
fibrillation.  She was transfered to the general medical floor
on hospital day 5.

1)Renal Failure: On admission it was found that Ms. [**Known lastname 95053**]
chronic renal failure had progressed to end stage renal failure
requiring hemodialysis.  Tunneled line placed for hemodialysis
access.  Pt required blood product support initially but none
during last 2 weeks of hospitalization.  Epoetin required during
HD.
*
2) Atrial Fibrillation - Pt found to have new diagnosis of
atrial fibrillation while in the MICU. Pt had runs up to the
130's with associated ST elevations while in th MICU.  She was
not anticoagulated initially secondary to bleeding at HD line
site. In attempting rate control, pt was treated with Amiodorone
load.  She did not respond adequately to Amiodorone alone, and
required additional medication for rate control. Pt continued to
be tachycardic on beta blocker.  Though rate was controlled on
Diltiazem, pt had multiple pauses of greater than 3 seconds
while on this therapy.  After extensive discussion with
Electrophysiology, patient and family, and primary team, with
continuous review of telemetry, it
