History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old male with known coronary artery

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-4-15**] INTRAOP TEE:
Prebypass: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. 2.There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 25%). with mild global RV free wall
hypokinesis. 3.There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. 4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**2-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Post Bypass: 1. Patient is being AV paced and receiving an
infusion of phenylephrine and epinephrine. 2. LV systolic
function is slightly improved. LVEF 30%. 3. Mild mitral
regurgitation present. 4. Aorta intact post decannulation.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2188-4-22**] 4:10 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.

INDICATION: Status post bypass surgery. Evaluate for effusion.

FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in
upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a
preceding chest examination of [**2188-4-17**]. Moderate cardiac
enlargement, status post bypass surgery, permanent pacer with
dual electrodes and wide-bore double-lumen catheter terminating
overlying the right atrium are unchanged. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature unaltered, thus no evidence
of interstitial or alveolar edema. There exists some mild
blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses confirmed by some
blunting of the posterior pleural sinuses as seen on the lateral
view. On the preceding study, the lateral pleural sinuses were
free (single view chest x-ray examination). In comparison with
the preoperative chest examination of [**4-10**] (PA and lateral
view), the pleural sinuses are free.

IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions noted
postoperatively after bypass surgery. No evidence of CHF or
acute parenchymal infiltrates. Further followup is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. He weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
Aspirin and Plavix were resumed, and he continued on his routine
dialysis schedule. He otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics
and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day two.

His platelet count dropped as low as 66K but by discharge, his
platelet count normalized. A postop HIT assay was negative. He
was intermittently transfused with PRBC to maintain hematocrit
near 30%.

He did experience some urinary retention which did require foley
re-insertion on postoperative day four. By discharge, he
continued to have difficulty voiding, his foley was reinserted
again, and he was started on flomax. He should have urology
follow up at rehab.

He continued dialysis without complication and was followed
closely by the renal service. At discharge, there were no new
recommendations.

Throughout his hospital stay, he had several episodes of atrial
fibrillation. He was started on an amiodarone load and coumadin.
Plavix was dc'd.

All incisions were healing well without evidence of infection.
Sternal staples should be removed on postoperative day 21.

He intermittently complained of difficulty hearing and should
also have ENT follow up.

Due to steady clinical improvements, he was eventually cleared
for discharge to rehab on postoperative day 8.
