Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF

History of Present Illness:
.
HPI:
83M with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG in [**2169**], MVR in [**2178**],
CHF, and COPD, presents to the ED after experiencing R hip pain
following a fall. He states that he was bending over, and became
dizzy with blurred visual after standing up abruptly. He fell on
his side. He denies LOC or head trauma. Films taken at his rehab
([**Hospital3 **]) demonstrated R femoral neck fracture, and he
was sent to [**Hospital1 **] ED. Of note, CXR at rehab on [**2183-10-10**] suggested
evidence of RLL and LUL infiltrate, and was started on
Levofloxacin 500mg PO qD x 10 days.
.
In the ED, initial VS were BP 134/69, HR 71, RR 18, SaO2 95% 2L
NC. Hip films confirmed R femoral neck fracture. Initial labs
significant for INR 5.4, on coumadin. CT head showed no evidence
of hemorrhage. He was seen by orthopedic surgery, who
recommended admission to medicine service for medical
optimization prior to likely ORIF surgery [**10-16**]. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
also complained of mild flank pain. A UA was ordered once he
reached the floor.

Pertinent Results:

ECG [**2183-10-15**]: V-paced at 84bpm
[**2183-10-18**]: Atrial fibrillation. Right axis deviation. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2183-10-15**] there is deep T wave inversion
in leads II, III, aVF and V3-V6 consistent with active ischemic
process. Rule out infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.


.
Imaging:
CXR [**2183-10-15**]:
Cardiomegaly, s/p CABG and MVR, dual-lead PPM. Elevation of
right hemidiaphragm with volume loss and interstitial opacities
c/w CHF. Also focal opactiy over R lung zone and fluid in
fissure, could be c/w PNA. Small effusions, no PTX.
.
Head CT [**2183-10-15**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage. The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are mildly
prominent, consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Multiple patchy areas of hypodensity in the white matter
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease, and
include hypodensity which is more prominent, but unchanged
within the left subinsular cortex. A bony protuberance about the
ossicle may represent an osteoma which is unchanged or merely a
congenital variant.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Evidence of age related involutional changes and white matter
disease, unchanged.
.
Hip films: There is a comminuted right femoral neck fracture.
Subtle angulation is present. No other fracture is identified.
IMPRESSION: Right femur fracture.
.
[**3-9**] PFTs:
FVC 1.98L (51% predicted)
FEV1 1.25L (51% predicted)
FEV1/FVC: 63% (100% predicted)
.
[**1-2**] TTE:
EF 40%. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
secondary to severe inferior and posterior hypokinesis and mild
hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle; the ejection
fraction is approximately 40 percent. There is moderate global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no significant aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty
ring is present. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**7-3**] Cath: (prior to MVR)
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel CAD. The left main coronary artery had a 40% distal
stenosis. The LAD had an 80% mid-vessel stenosis, and there was
competitive flow from the LIMA in the distal LAD. The ramus
intermedius branch had a 40% proximal stenosis. The left
circumflex artery was totally occluded proximally. The RCA had a
diffusely diseased proximal segment and was totally occluded
after the first acute marginal branch.
2. Graft arteriography revealed a patent LIMA to the LAD. The
SVG to the rPDA was widely patent, and the rPDA distal to the
anastamosis had a 70% stenosis. The SVG to the obtuse marginal
branch was ectatic but without significant stenosis and the
marginal branch distal to the anastamosis supplied collaterals
to the right postero-lateral branch.
3. Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed severe pulmonary
hypertension witha PA systolic pressure of 92 mmHg. There was
increased right and left sided filling pressures with a mean RA
pressure of 16 mmHg, a mean PCWP of 28 mmHg and an LVEDP of 22
mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2.
4. Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with
posterobasal wall akinesis and moderate-to-severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation. The calculated LVEF was 45%.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA and SVGs.
3. Moderate-to-severe (3+) mitral regurgitation.
4. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
5. Severe pulmonary hypertension
