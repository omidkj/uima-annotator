Lopressor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
77 year old white female with chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac catheterization without any intervention
CABG x 4 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM2, OM3, PDA)/MV repair with 28mm
annuloplasty band.


History of Present Illness:
76 yo female with PMH HTN, hyperlipidemia, presumed CHF/CAD now
being evaluated for acute respiratory distress and renal
dysfunction while in cath lab holding area for evaluation of
acute coronary syndrome. Apparently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] in
[**5-23**] at which pt was intubated for ?CHF/aspiration pneumonia.
Apparently treated with antibiotics. Labs were notable for
troponin 3.8, CPK 326 with MB 61. Creatinine ranged from 1.5 to
peak 2.3. No echo or cath was performed during that
hospitalization. Since [**5-18**], pt had episodes of intermittent
substernal chest pain with associated shortness of breath
sometimes waking her up from sleep and self-limited. No use of
nitro. Pt denies significant extremity swelling or PND.
+orthopnea. Pt states she has unexplained weight loss. Denies
fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, cough, abdominal pain,
urinary/bowel symptoms.
.
In PCP office today, pt presented with an episode of CP this
morning. EKG performed at PCP's office reportedly showed
inferolateral ST depressions. She was sent to OSH ED where she
was reportedly found to have K of 7.4, creatinine 3.0, bicarb of
12. She arrived in [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab holding area after evaluation
at OSH where she was chest pain free but loaded with Plavix,
ASA, heparin, and integrillin drip.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], found to have hyperkalemia of 7.1 and was
given amp of bicarb, calcium chloride, followed by additional
1.5 amp of bicar, 10U IV insulin, and 40mg IV lasix. Noted to
have significantly decreased urine output. Developed increased
SOB and hypertensive to 170's, requiring 97% non-rebreather. She
was given Lasix 100mg IV, morphine 2mg, nitro drip. Transferred
to CCU for further evaluation.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC  [**2156-11-30**] 4:34 PM

PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC

Reason: please assess Lt adenxal mass

INDICATIONS: A 6-cm left ovarian cyst seen on MRI. Please assess
left adnexal mass.

COMPARISON: Reference is made to the pelvic MRI from [**2156-11-25**].

PELVIC ULTRASOUND: Transabdominal examination was performed. The
uterus measures 6.5 x 5.9 x 4.2 cm. There are 2 fibroids
visualized transabdominally, the largest of which measures 2.2 x
1.7 cm. Within the left adnexa is a 6.0 x 6.7 x 4.4 cm cyst,
which contains layering internal debris. This cystic structure
is completely avascular. The right ovary was not visualized.

IMPRESSION:
6-cm avascular cystic structure in the left adnexa with internal
debris with a fluid debris level. This could be ovarian in
origin, but could also represent a paraovarian cyst with
internal hemorrhage. Fibroid uterus.
Followup imaging in 3 months is recommended to assure stability
of the cyst.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-12-7**] 2:35 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o PTX

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman s/p cabg/MV repair with right OJ line change.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PTX
CLINICAL HISTORY: Status-post CABG and MV repair, IJ line
change, evaluate for pneumothorax.

CHEST: Swan Ganz catheter has been withdrawn and a new IJ line
placed with the tip in the right atrium. No evidence of a
pnuemothorax is seen.

Since previous chest x-ray, the nasogastric tube test and
mediastinal tubes have all been removed. No failure is seen.
Atelectasis of the left base is present.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax, atelectasis left base.





Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt was admitted with an NSTEMI for urgent cardiac cath.
However, she was unable to have a cath performed immediately
given her acute on chronic renal failure and respiratory
distress secondary to flash pulmonary edema. She was chest pain
free on admission. Pt was initially medically managed on
aspirin, statin, and IV heparin. ACE was held secondary to renal
failure. Beta-blocker and integrillin were started on HD2.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and pt had a peak CK of 335. Pt was
medically managed until renal function improved enough to under
cardiac catheterization. Pt has cardiac cath performed on [**11-22**]
with showed severe diffuse 3 vessel disease (see results section
for details). No intervention was performed. She was given IVF,
bicarb, and mucomyst peri-procedure for renal protection. CT
surgery was consulted who felt that pt was operative candidate.
Pre-op studies were initiated. Ultrasound of the carotids
revealed right ICA with 80-99% occlusion and L ICA with 40%
occlusion. Pt was evaluated by neurology stroke service who
recommended MRI/MRA of brain to look for intracranial artery
stenosis and subclinical right hemisphere watershed stroke. They
also recommed checked homocysteine level and empiric Vit B
complex/folic acid. Pt was started on folic acid. MRI/MRA of
brain found no acute stroke and occlused left vertebral artery;
all other intracranial vessels were open. Neuro stated that
cardotid stenting could be performed either before or after CABG
and left it up to the discretion of the CT surgeon. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28946**]
requested carotid stenting prior to CABG. Carotid stenting was
performed on [**11-30**] without complications. Pt remained chest pain
free and hemodynamically stable throughout the hospitalization.
Pt went for CABG on [**12-2**].
.
2. Renal failure: Pt presented with acute on chronic renal
failure. (Cr from [**Month (only) 116**] was between 1.5-2.2.). Etiology of chronic
renal failure likely poorly controlled hypertension. On arrival
to the CCU, K still elevated at 6.8. Pt was given D50/insulin,
lasix, and kayexalate with improvement in potassium to 6.0. EKG
initially showed junctional rhythm with peaked T waves. ACE was
held. Pt appeared to be clinically volume overloaded with
decreased urine output. IV Lasix was given for diuresis; had
good UO initially, which tapered off. Nitro drip was
discontinued and natrecor drip was started for afterload
reduction and diuresis. By HD2, K was 5.6, EKG changes were
resolved, and pt appeared less volume overloaded with resolution
of respiratory distress. On HD2, pt was started on
Lasix/zaroxlyn for additional diuresis. Pt was seen by renal who
suggested 1 amp of bicarb q6 x 24h to treat bicarb of 16; these
was given with improvement in bicarb to 22. Epo was started at
the suggestion of renal. On HD3, pt was noted to be euvolemic
with normalized lytes. Diuresis was changed to prn basis. Over
the next several days, creatinine slo
