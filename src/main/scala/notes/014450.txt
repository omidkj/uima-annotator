[**2130-9-18**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: Upper zone redistribution. Prominence
of hila, which may relate to underlying pulmonary hypertension.
Peribronchial cuffing, unchanged. No definite infiltrate.
.
[**9-16**]: Blood Cultures: positive for GPC in pairs and chains in
[**1-20**] bottles

.
[**2130-9-22**]: TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There are filamentous strands on the
aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant) as well as a focal calcification on  the left coronary
cusp - no definite vegitation seen. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically
suggested.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-19**]:
Pulmonary edema has largely cleared. A mild degree of residual
edema or atelectasis persists at the lung bases and there may be
a small right pleural effusion. The heart is top normal size and
unchanged. Slight rightward displacement of the trachea at the
thoracic inlet is longstanding, most likely due to an enlarged
left lobe of the thyroid gland
.
[**2130-9-16**]:
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of midline structures is
demonstrated. Differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter is
preserved. The sulci, ventricles, and basal cisterns are all
within normal limits. Polypoid mucosal thickening versus a
retention cyst is seen within the left maxillary sinus.
Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear. Calcification of the internal carotid arteries and
vertebral arteries bilaterally are again noted.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain parenchyma without
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 F with multiple medical problems, including CAD, CHF, PVD,
DM2, who presented with a near syncopal episode, fever, elevated
WBC, some nausea today with poor PO intake who was found to have
GPC bacteremia and NSTEMI on [**9-17**].
.
#Fever:
Unclear source. Elevated WBC  with left shift suggesting
infection. viral infection possible (?influenza, although veyr
atypical story without myalgias); CAP (dry, no doesnt show on
CXR), occult bacteremia. Viral Cx (including influenza)
negative.
-UA and LP were negative in ED
-[**12-21**] postive for GPC in pairs and clusters - IDd as Coag
negative Staphlococcus -> started on Vancomycin 1g q 24 -
renally dosed -> then switched to Levofloxacin to one d
