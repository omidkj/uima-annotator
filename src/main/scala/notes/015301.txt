Chief Complaint:
hip fracture s/p mechanical fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF of right hip
Cardiac catheterization
Transesophageal echocardiogram
Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21160**] is an 87 [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident with a history of
coronary disease, s/p MI [**2167**], type II diabetes on oral therapy,
dementia, atrial fibrillation on warfarin who fell at his NH
this am and heard a "crack" in his hip - transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED where he is found to have a externally rotated and
foreshortened Rt LE and a comminuted right intertrochanteric
femur fracture. He was also noted to have a rt foot cellulitis.
He was afebrile on presentation, with a bp of 116/70, but was
soon noted to have a pressure drop to the 70's systolic and Hct
drop 27 to 22. He was guaiac neg. His INR was 2.6. He was given
2 U blood, 4 Units NS, 4 units FFP. His pressure responded well,
but he developed basilar crackles and mild dyspnea. He was noted
to have infero-lateral ST depressions during this episode with
relative tachycardia in the 120's (afib/rvr) - initial Trop T
0.03. Cardiology and Orthopedics were consulted.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2169-9-11**]: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response; Indeterminate axis. Possible inferior infarct - age
undetermined. Cannot rule out anteroseptal infarct - age
undetermined . Lateral ST-T changes may be due to ischemia. No
previous tracing available for comparison

EKG [**2169-9-19**]: Probable atrial flutter.  Indeterminate axis.
Possible prior inferior infarct. Consider prior anterior
myocardial infarction. Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities. Consider
also in part chronic pulmonary disease or right ventricular
overload.

IMAGING
HIP  [**2169-9-11**] Comminuted right intertrochanteric femur fracture.

Echo [**2169-9-11**]
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The  right atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular  cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal  (LVEF>55%). Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include mild distal  anteroseptal and
apical hypokinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic  function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet  excursion.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is  not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is
severe mitral  annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
8.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
9.There is no pericardial effusion.

Cardiac Cath [**2169-9-12**]
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated
severe 3 vessel and left main coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had a mid-segment 70% stenosis.  The LAD was calcific and
diffusely diseased in the mid-segment with 70% stenosis.  The
LCx was heavily calcified with an origin OM1 60% stenosis,
patent OM2, and totally occluded OM3 that filled via
collaterals.  There was distal occlusion of the AV groove LCx
after the takeoff of the OM2.  The RCA was severely calcified
with diffuse disease throughout the entire vessel.  There was
origin 90% stenosis and serial 70-80% stenoses in the mid
segment.  The RCA also had a total occlusion in the distal
segment.  The RPL filled briskly via collaterals from the LAD.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial pressures (114/63 mm Hg).

[**2169-9-15**]
Interval placement of dynamic femoral hip rod with improvement
of alignment of right intertrochanteric femoral fracture.

TEE [**2169-9-20**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left  atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial  appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in
the right atrium or right atrial  appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are   three aortic
valve leaflets. Mild (1+) eccentric aortic regurgitation is
seen.   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen with Significant
pulmonic regurgitation   is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation
appears eccentric and is probably moderate   but is not fully
visualized.

CXR PA/Lat [**2169-9-21**]: The heart is enlarged. Bilateral upper zone
redistribution with effusions is present consistent with known
failure.
There has been little change since the prior chest x-ray of
[**9-17**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21160**] is an 87 year old man with a history of coronary
disease, h/o reported AF on coumadin, type II DM, admitted [**9-11**]
with R intertrochanteric hip fracture.

1) Hip fracture:
Pt was admitted and found to have a R hip fracture.  He
developed an acute anemia thought to be secondary to hematoma.
He was admitted to the MICU for fluid overload and tachycardia.
His INR was reversed with FFP and he was given PRBC transfusion.
 After being cleared by medicine and cardiology, he was brought
to the OR on [**2169-9-15**] for an uncomplicated ORIF.

2) Cardiac:
a) Ischemia:
The patient experienced tachycardia and was noted to have
inferolateral ST changes.  He also had slightly positive cardiac
enzymes.  Cardiology was consulted given the possibility of
active ischemia.  An echo demonstrated apical WMA.  Ultimately,
for preoperative clearence, cardiology referred the patient for
cardiac cath.  Cath demonstrated severe 3-VD and it was
recommended that he only be medically optimized as he is not a
good candidate for percutaneous intervention or bypass surgery.

b) Rhythm: The patient has a reported history of atrial
fibrillation.  He is maintained on coumadin and was therapeutic
on admission.  Given his possible hematoma, his INR was
reversed.  Unfortunately, he developed a difficult to control
tachycardia and required escalat
