HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38472**] is a 58 year old
male transferred to the Medical Service from the Neurosurgery
Service on [**2170-12-31**].  The patient was initially
admitted on [**12-26**], for elective laminectomy which was
uncomplicated except for a 2.5 units estimated blood loss and
administration of two units of packed red blood cells and 9
liters of Crystalloid in the Operating Room.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be hypoxic and
hypotensive requiring Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure
support, and then nine hours postoperatively, CT scan
angiogram found to have large flow obstructing right
pulmonary artery embolus and a smaller left lower lobe and
lingular emboli.  The patient's pulmonary emboli was lysed
with tissue plasminogen activator and removed by suction
thrombectomy with good affect.

Echocardiogram following the procedure showed some mild right
ventricular dilatation and free wall hypokinesis and a normal
left ventricle.  An inferior vena cava filter was also
placed.  He was intubated for approximately 48 hours with
successful intubation and normal low O2 requirements since
then.  He was heparinized postoperatively, requiring
inordinately high doses of heparin up to 2500 units per hour
to maintain therapeutic PTT in the 60 to 80 range.  Coumadin
was started on [**2170-12-31**], and he was transferred from
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine Floor.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Heparin drip.
2.  Zantac 75 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
4.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. per day.
5.  Oxy-Contin 20 mg p.o. three times a day.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. six hours p.r.n.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Senna, one to two tablets p.o. q. h.s. p.r.n.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cervical spondylosis, worse at the C4, C5 and C5-C6
levels with T1-T2 disc herniation.
2.  Preoperative cardiac work-up was negative.
3.  Peripheral neuropathy.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Depression.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Zoloft.
3.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:   He has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Occasional ethanol.  No tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer, his vital signs were
temperature 98.4 F.; blood pressure 114/52; heart rate 79;
respiratory rate 27, saturating 96% on two liters.  He was
alert and oriented times three, pleasant, cooperative, neck
collar in place.  Oropharynx clear with moist mucous
membranes.  Neck with large cervical collar with large
posterior dressing; no jugular venous distention.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Heart was beating with a
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  He had
mild left upper extremity swelling with good pulses.  Lower
extremities sans edema.

LABORATORY:  His laboratories upon transfer were
unremarkable.  Hematocrit of 28.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In general, this is a 58 year old man,
status post laminectomy complicated by pulmonary embolism.
He was continued on heparin and Coumadin from [**12-31**]
until [**1-2**], when his INR reached 2.5 and heparin was
discontinued.  The patient will need to remain on life-long
Coumadin because of the presence of his [**Location (un) 260**] filter.

For his spinal surgery, he was followed by the Orthopedic
Service and continued in a C-collar.  He was evaluated by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and was deemed to
need acute rehabilitation upon discharge.

Pain control was with Oxy-Contin to be titrated over the two
weeks following discharge with Percocet p.r.n.  He was also
started on Topamax 50 mg twice a day for peripheral
neuropathy.  The patient's white count and laboratory
remained stable during the hospitalization and he was
transferred to rehabilitation hospital on [**1-3**], in
good condition.
