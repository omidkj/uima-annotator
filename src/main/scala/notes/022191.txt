HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old man with a
history of compression fractures, chronic back pain and
atrial fibrillation who presents this admission to the
Neurology Service on [**2113-8-20**] with new
Patient had reported a fall two days ago where legs gave way
without warning and he did not injure himself.  His wife was
there to support him and he had no alternation in
consciousness, no vertigo, no lightheadedness, shortness of
breath, acute weakness.  Then, he had shortly thereafter, had
worsening of his back pain, as per his primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] his wife.  The patient himself denied
Yesterday, he was able to use his walker as usual and apart
from the back pain felt in his usual state of health.  When
he awoke the day later (morning of admission) it was found that
he was unable to move his legs. No urinary frequency or urgency,
incontinence, no bowel movements on the day of admission which
patient reported was unusual.  Denies weakness in his arms, neck
pain, numbness and tingling, no fever, night sweats, headache.
Patient and his wife denies any progression of  his weakness
beyond the
a.m.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Depakote, Coumadin, digoxin,
Restoril, Synthroid, hydrocodone, Zantac and OxyContin.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 130/77.  Heart
rate 96.  Temperature 98.  Respiratory rate 16, 02 saturation
98%.  Appearance, emaciated elderly lying uncomfortably on
his right side, unwilling to cooperate full, disinterested,
was fed and irritated.  The patient has severe cervical
rigidity and kyphosis.  Range of motion of the neck is
severely decreased.  The neck is nontender to palpation.
Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac:  Normal S1, S2.
Abdomen:  Soft, tender, no organomegaly, +2 brachial pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologic exam:  He is awake, alert, oriented
to all modalities except he believes that it is [**8-27**].
Aware of all the recent current events.  Speech fluent,
spontaneous, no paraphasic errors.  There is no right-left
confusion, neglect.  Release testing reveals left greater
that right palmomental reflex, normal jaw jerk, no rooting,
slight grasp bilaterally. On cranial nerve exam:  Ocular
discs are sharp.  Visual fields full, [**1-1**] round and reactive.
There is no relative afferent defect.  Extraocular movements
are full, no nystagmus.  Facial sensation intact to light
touch.  Face is symmetric and movements are intact.
Sternocleidomastoid strength of [**4-1**].  Tongue movements are
intact and palatal elevation is symmetric.  On motor exam,
there is generally  decreased bulk and tone, decreased
symmetrically, there is generalized wasting, especially of
the intrinsic muscles of the hands, quads, gastrocnemius
bilaterally.  No drift.  Motor strength testing reveals
generally 4+/5 in the upper extremities and anywhere from 0-3
in the lower extremities. He was able to exert some proximal
movements, but no distal. Reflexes are brachial 3+
bilaterally and 1+ bilaterally otherwise with downgoing toes
bilaterally and no clonus.  On sensory exam, light touch is
decreased in the feet bilaterally. It is difficult to determine
whether or not there is a sensory level. Repeated testing does
not show any clear finding. Pinprick and temperature
is decreased in the feet symmetrically.  Position sense was
impaired in the toes, but not impaired in the ankles. Mildly
impaired position sense in the fingers bilaterally. Coordination
testing, finger to nose is without ataxia. Stance and gait could
not be tested.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram [**2107**]:  Atrial
fibrillation, nonspecific ST changes.  Laboratories from
[**8-9**]:  CBC:  White blood cell count 13.9, hematocrit
34 and CB 115, platelets 110.  INR 2.4, CK 171.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above, 76-year-old man admitted
initially to the Neurology Service on [**2113-8-20**],
ultimately transferred to the Medical Service on [**2113-8-30**].  He was admitted with severe paraparesis, status post fall
without loss of consciousness or head trauma and worsening
back pain.  CT of the thoracolumbar spine done on [**8-21**] showed T12, L1, L4-L5 compression fractures with
retrolisthesis of L3 and L4 and L4 on L5 and a calcified mass
on the tail of the pancreas.  CT of abdomen [**8-22**] with
contrast showed a 4 x 8 x 5. cm mass in the tail of the
pancreas and several tiny nodules in lung bases, left greater
with right with patchy linear opacities in right base.  Bone
scan on [**8-23**] showed increased foci in the lower
lumbar spine and right iliac ring suspicious for metastatic
disease. MRI of lumbar spine showed mass in the lumbo-sacral
region. A myelogram was ordered initially, but could not be done
because the patient refused the myelogram on the first day and
subsequently had abnormally high INR. On the day that the
myelogram was scheduled for, he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit after a respiratory arrest on [**8-25**]
and intubated.  Bronchoscopy at that time showed significant
aspirated material.  Differential diagnoses include:
Secondary to his narcotic pain medications versus aspiration
pneumonia.  His pCO2 at that time was noted to be 89.  He was
started on levofloxacin and clindamycin and Counseling
service while he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He
was initially started on dexamethasone for presumed cord
compression on [**8-25**] and family ultimately declined
transfer to [**Hospital6 1708**] for CT myelogram.
It should be noted that the patient was unable to tolerate an
MRI secondary to his scoliosis.  Transiently on dopamine for
hypotension and transfused one unit of packed red blood
cells.  Ultimately, patient did receive a CT myelogram which
showed obstruction to flow of contrast from below at T8 and
T9 level.  It was an overall limited study.  Also a sacral
mass at the epidural extension.  Question of a T spine
epidural mass and ultimately his Decadron was discontinued on
[**8-29**], because of no improvement.  He received
Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology consults.  The patient
was extubated on [**2113-8-29**] with a plan for a sacral
mass biopsy.  CT guided biopsy which was done on [**2113-8-29**].
Patient was transiently transferred to the Medical Service
from [**8-29**] through [**8-31**] but had another respiratory
arrest while on the floor with gradually worsening
hypercapnia and acidosis. He was found unresponsive, without
respirations and reintubated and transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Overall impression at this time on
[**8-31**] was that patient likely had metastatic pancreatic
disease, left pancreatic cancer.  He had a mildly elevated
PSA but this was not thought to be related to his current
process.  Ultimately, his biopsy of his sacral lesions was
consistent with malignancy, likely adenocarcinoma.
Respiratory support was continued with suspected patient more
than likely had a mucus plugging event. In discussion between the
family, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
the Team, it was felt that the patient clearly had another
source of adenocarcinoma.  His overall prognosis is extremely
grave and the patient's dopamine was weaned.  The patient was
extubated and accepted by [**Hospital **] Hospice and was transferred
there on [**2113-9-2**].  Patient had requested that his
body be don
