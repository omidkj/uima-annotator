Imaging:
CXR PA&LAT ([**2155-6-16**]): Cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary vascular
congestion. Small right effusion.
.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2155-6-19**]): No acute hemorrhage. No acute
intracranial process. Stable ventriculomegaly since 4/[**2153**].
.
ECHO ([**2155-6-20**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-12-24**], the pulmonary artery systolic pressure is markedly further
increased, and the right ventricle is now dilated and
hypocontractile; pericardial effusion appears similar in size.
.
CXR PA&LAT ([**6-24**]): Improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema
with only mild pulmonary venous distension on the current
radiograph.





Brief Hospital Course:
89 y.o with dCHF presentes with dyspnea [**1-7**] to CHF exacerbation.
Treated with increased lasix. Course complicated by AMS,
requiring ICU admission. AMS thought secondary to respiradone,
MS improved with discontinuation.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: BNP was 8948. Unclear what the
etiology for most recent exacerbation is, diastolic dysfunction
likely [**1-7**] HTN and AS. Echo on [**6-20**] showed pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is markedly further increased, and the right
ventricle is now dilated and hypocontractile; pericardial
effusion appears similar in size to echo done in [**Month (only) 404**]. ASA,
statin and isosorbide mononitrate were continued. Treated
briefly with lasix drip in MICU. On the floor Lasix was
increased to 80mg PO BID, however the bicarb and sodium have
been trending up. Today bicarb is 38 and sodium is 143.
Creatinine has been stable at 1.9 (the patient's baseline.)
Repeat CXR showed improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema
with only mild pulmonary venous distension. Pt is now euvolemic
on exam with improvement in SOB and O2 sats 99% on 2L (the
patient's baseline.)
- Continue furosemide 80mg PO BID
- Recheck electrolytes and Cr on [**6-27**]
.
# AMS. Devoloped somulance on the floor CO2 peak of 77.
Transfered to the MICU was BIPAP was briefly used. Thought
secondary to medication (resperidone) combined with mild
hypercarbia [**1-7**] CHF and underlying lung disease. Mentation
improved with discontinuation of risperidone, BIPAP, and Lasix
drip. After transfer to the floor MS remained at baseline,
confirmed by her son.

.
# Aortic stenosis: Moderate AS valve area 1-1.2, unchanged on
echo [**6-20**]
.
# Afib: Usually rate controlled, currently in sinus, HR in 80s.
INR subtherapeutic on admission (1.8), and home dosing was
unclear. We believe that her home dose was 2mg Sun/Mon/Tues/Wed
+ 3mg Thurs/Sat. We increased her dose to Warfarin 3 mg
Thurs/Sat + 4mg Sun/Mon/Tues/Wed. Her INR was therapeutic until
this morning when it was found to be high (3.6).
- Hold warfarin tomorrow ([**2155-6-26**]) and check INR on Friday and
then resume at 2mg daily; this may need to be further titrated.
.
# Chronic abdominal pain: Not active during hospitalization.
.
# CKD: Creatinine at baseline (1.9), remained stable with
diuresis.
.
# HTN: BP well controlled. Pt with RAS and R nephrectomy.
Amlodipine was continued.
.
# Gout: No active symptoms. We continued home doses of
allopurinol, tylenol PRN.
.
# Glaucoma: Stable
- Continue Dorzolamide/timolol (cosopt 2-0.5% opthalmic)
.
# Psych:
- Holding risperdal for somnolence
- Sertraline decreased to 50mg PO daily
.
# Code Status: DNR/DNI
