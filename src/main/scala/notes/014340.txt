History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year-old man with coronary artery disease s/p
4 vessel CABG [**2158**]  (LIMA to the LAD, SVG to PDA, SVG to D1, SVG
to OM1 with jump to OM2 & Om3) c/b aortic dissection and
bioprosthetic [**Last Name (LF) 1291**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 35% ([**8-2**]) s/p BiV pacemaker, AF on
amiodarone, failed endovascular repair of AAA, R->L fem-fem
bypass graft ([**2169**]) following resulting in R iliac dissection,
AAA repair [**2172**], with recent admissions for diuresis that now
presents to the CCU with AMS.
.
The pt was at [**Hospital6 33**] (discharged [**2178-8-5**])
following admission for worsening dyspnea and bilateral lower
extremity edema. At that time the pts symptoms had been
progressive over the prior 2 months. The pt had experienced
worsening of his edema, preventing him from ambulating even with
his walker, mild DOE, and nausea and vomitting for days prior to
her admission to [**Hospital3 **].
.
The pt was then admitted  to [**Hospital1 18**]([**Date range (3) 95453**]) during
which he was on lasix drip with aggressive diuresis. SBP
somewhat low that admission and was ~85-95 when discharged.
.
The patient then re-presented on [**2178-8-13**] with generalized
malaise, ankle pain, and intermittent lethargy. Over the past 8
days the pt has been lethargic and intermittently delirius.  He
was found to have a coag negative staph UTI which is being
treated with vancomycine (day 1=[**8-18**]).  Because of his altered
mental status and transient abdominal pain he had a CT head and
abdomen, both of which were negative for any acute process.  He
has appeared total body overloaded, but mostly with normal O2
Sat on RA. Lasix has been held in the setting of borderline BP.
He has triggered 5 times for his altered mental status and
hypotension, which has been attributed to a combination of
delirium from UTI and oxycodone, which he has been getting
because of ankle pain of unclear etiology.  Creatinine has also
been rising from baseline 2.0 up to 3.5 today.
.
Because he remained with tenuous blood pressures and apparent
volume overload, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was planning on being electively
transferred to the CCU for ionotropic support and further
diuresis.
.
Immediately prior to transfer, he noted on telemetry to have
slow VT at a rate of ~110.  Patient was found lethargic but
arousable, then briefly rolled his eyes back and became briefly
unresponsive for seconds.  Monitor showed VT that returned to
NSR, and patient returned to responsiveness before any drugs or
shocks could be delivered.  ABG showed 7.42/46/39.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient difficult to arouse but following
commands and A&O x 1.  Shortly after arrival to the CCU, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] had several further episodes of self-terminating VT with
? decreased responsiveness and BP falling to 60s.  Episodes
resolved within 30 seconds without intervention, with BP
returning to the 80s systolic.
.
On arrival to the CCU, review of systems was positive for
shortness of breath.  The patient denies chest pain.  Other
review of systems was negative.

[**8-15**]- CT Abd/Pelvis w/o contrast-
1. B/L small-to-moderate pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.
2. Increased attenuation of the liver, compatible with history
of amiodarone therapy. There are no focal liver lesions and no
biliary dilatation. However, the liver does appear somewhat
nodular, and correlation with liver function tests is
recommended.
3. Small perihepatic and perisplenic ascites, with diffuse
anasarca of the
mesentery and superficial soft tissues, likely reflecting third
spacing.
4. Marked atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta, renal
arteries, celiac axis, and SMA.
5. Status post endovascular aneurysm repair of infrarenal
abdominal aortic
aneurysm, with decreased size of the aneurysm sac compared to
[**2173-2-22**].
6. Diverticulosis without convincing evidence of diverticulitis.

7. Marked degenerative change of the lumbar spine.

[**8-14**]- CT head w/o contrast-
1. No hemorrhage or edema.
2. Parenchymal involutional change.
3. Severe white matter ischemic change.
