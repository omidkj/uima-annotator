Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8684**]
Chief Complaint:
AV fistula thrombus, GNR bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right AV thrombectomy
removal of hemodialysis line


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 y.o. female with h/o HTN, CHF (diastolic, EF
of 55% and LVH on echo [**11-17**]), hyperlipidemia, gout, sarcoid,
ESRD on HD who was admitted for thrombectomy of left AV graft.
Had low-grade temp at admission to 100.0F. Tunneled HD line
placed one month ago for temporary HD. Thrombectomy successful,
graft patent.  One day s/p thrombectomy, spiked a temp
post-procedure. She has had persistent fevers and Tmax of 103.4.
Pt was empirically started on vancomycin and flagyl overnight on
[**2-24**], and had bcx drawn. Dialyzed [**2-24**] through tunneled R IJ
line without complication. On [**2-25**], bcx grew 3/4 bottles of
GNRs. Zosyn added, and one dose gentamicin 80mg IV given. Pt
appeared more somnolent and tachycardic, so was transferred to
the MICU.
Pt denies CP, SOB, diarrhea, abd pain, chills or confusion.

[**2159-2-24**] CXR: No pulmonary edema or pneumonia or pneumothorax.
.
[**2159-2-27**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-12-4**],
findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo female with ESRD on hemodialysis, gout, hypertension, CHF,
s/p thrombectomy of AVF whom postoperatively was found to have
fever, tachycardia, somnolence, GNR bacteremia (proteus
mirabilis), treated with Cipro with resolution of signs and
symptoms.
.
#Fever: Fever was in the setting of Proteus mirabilis
bacteremia.  The patient's right tunnelled IJ catheter tip was
also culture positive for Proteus, and this was thought to be
the source.  The bacteria was pan-sensitive, and she was treated
with Cipro beginning [**2159-2-25**].  She had been on Zosyn for one day
until the culture came back pan-sensitive.  Urinalysis was
negative.  Surveillance cultures were negative after [**2159-2-25**].
Plan to continue on Cipro for a total course of 14 days
([**2159-3-12**]).  TTE was negative for vegetations, although could not
be definitively ruled out.  It was decided to defer TEE as the
patient was clinically much improved and suspicion for
endocarditis was low. Some surveillance cultures were not yet
finalized on the day of discharge, and the results will be
followed up as an outpatient.
.
#  Mental status change:  the patient was somnolent on initial
presentation.  This was felt to be due to the acute infection,
and mental status improved with treatment of her bacteremia.
She was at baseline mental status, appropriately answering
questions, and oriented to person, place, and year prior to
transfer to the floor.  During the remainder of her stay, there
were no other mental status changes.
.
# ESRD  :  She was followed by Nephrology and underwent dialysis
under usually weekly schedule (T/Th/Sat).  Transplant surgery
evaluated and cleared the right AV fistula for use through which
she was dialyzed on [**2159-2-27**].  She also continues on sevelamer.
.
#  Gout:  Not active.  Continued allopurinol.
.
#  HTN/CAD:  no acute issues.  Intially when the patient
presented to the MICU, febrile, her home medications were held.
Prior to transfer to floor her home po antihypertensives were
resumed.  She continues on amlodipine and labetalol, titrate
labetalol as needed (outpatient).
.
#  CHF: ECHO performed during this admission (to rule out
vegetations) showed no changes from previous, EF > 55% but with
LVH.  no acute decompensation.  Continued Irbesartan and
Amlodipine for afterload reduction.
.
#  Dispo:  Full code.  Daughter [**Name (NI) 19267**] is her health care proxy
should one be needed.  Physical therapy evaluated the patient
and determined that she would need rehad inpatient PT/OT.
