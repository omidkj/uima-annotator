                            **FINAL REPORT [**2162-10-17**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2162-10-17**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.

Skin Biopsy: Prelim result consistent with [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **]
Syndrome. Final read pending.

HSV and VZV swab of oral lesions: pending.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rash:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87785**] presented with a rash and mucositis consistent with
[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome after receiving amoxicillin and
Diflucan. She was initially admitted to the ICU for
fluid-responsive hypotension and then transferred to the floor.
Dermatology was consulted (contact, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) and a
biopsy was performed. The preliminary results were consistent
with SJS. The dermatology team recommended
clobetasol to closed skin lesions to prevent pruritus (avoiding
face and inguinal region) and mupirocin to open skin lesions.
She will follow-up with the dermatology team within 1 week
(clinic phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1971**]). She also used viscous Lidocaine for
symptom relief of her oral lesions.

The differential for her skin lesions also included erythema
multiforme. Her oral lesions were swabbed for HSV, VZV and she
was treated with 2 doses of Valtrex. The HSV and VZV studies
were pending at discharge.

2. Yeast infection:
The examination of her vulva and groin was also consistent with
a preceding fungal infection. Given the possible reaction to
oral Diflucan she was recommended to receive 7 days of topical
nystatin powder.

3. UTI:
 - her admission urinalysis was consistent with a UTI and she
was briefly treated with ciprofloxacin until her culture
returned with <10,000 CFUs. Ms. [**Known lastname 87785**] had no urinary symptoms
or fevers at discharge.

4. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia
 - evaluation was consistent with B12 and Iron deficiency. She
also has a history of vitamin D deficiency and had a borderline
low calcium on admission. For this, she should be evaluated for
sprue as an outpatient. She was started on replacement B12,
Vitamin D, and iron (she also has a history of
menometrorrhagia).

No other changes were made to her regimen for her COPD or
depression.
