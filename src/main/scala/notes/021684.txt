Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo F with a history of COPD presents with two days of facial
and tongue swelling accompanied by shortness of breath and a
rash. Pt was monitored briefly in MICU given concern for airway
compromise. Lisinopril and colchicine were stopped and she was
started on prednisone, benadryl and pepcid with improvement of
her symptoms.

# Angioedema/allergic reaction: Unknown trigger, but thought to
be due to her lisinopril. Patient had been taking it for years,
and then it was stopped, and restarted 2 months ago.
ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema can occur years after starting
treatment with the medication, so it is still possible.
Lisinopril was stopped in the hospital and patient was started
on steroids, benadryl and pepcid with good effect. C1 esterase,
C3/C4 and tryptase were drawn during this admission but are
pending. Her symptoms improved and patient did not experience
any airway compromise. Patient is being discharged on steroid
taper.

# COPD: pt has known COPD, the most recent PFTs of which show:
FEV1 68%, FVC 99% predicted, and FEV1/FVC ratio of 49. She was
continued on home O2 and medications and did well.

# CAD: stable s/p stent. denied chest pain throughout hospital
stay. She was continued on ASA.

# Diabetes Mellitus: she was continued on home glipizide. She
was also started on insulin SS and QACHS fingersticks given
increased dose of steroids, but her sugars remained in
relatively good control. She was not discharged on insulin given
the quick taper of steroids.

# Hypertension: per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] on lisinopril not for BP
management but more for her diabetes. Her lisinopril was held
and she was not started on any regimen. She may need some
antihypertensive [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the future.

# Gout: Pt with recent gout flare, followed by rheumatology
here. She was started on steroids with slow taper, and then
started on  allopurinol and colchicine as well. Colchicine was
held on admission given that patient is not having an acute
flare of gout and also because it could cause hypersensitivity
reaction. This can be restarted more carefully in the future if
patient needs it for gout flares. She was continued on
allopurinol.

# Rash: much improved by the time she was on the floor. Given
the fungal infection appearance of rash under her breast on
exam, patient was started on miconazole powder.

# PMR: history of PMR in [**2172**] with flare in [**2174**], treated with
steroids by rheumatology. Has not really had recent symptoms
from PMR.

# hypothyroidism: patient was continued on home synthroid

Transitional Issues:
[ ] C1 esterase and tryptase still pending from this
hospitalization
[ ] patient instructed to do a quick taper by 10 mg each day
(from 50 mg on discharge), and then to continue 10 mg daily
until instructed by rheumatology otherwise
[ ] patient was referred to an allergy specialist given her
presentation with rash and angioedema
[ ] patient still has rash under her breast, being treated with
miconazole powder at the time of discharge - may need to be
followed
[ ] patient had PT evaluation in the hospital given her
complaint that she feels "weak." she was cleared by PT, but is
going home with home PT to further help with ambulation.
