Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1945**]
Chief Complaint:
fall, hip fracture, humerus fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.
Arterial line placement.
Surgical fixation of left intertrochanteric hip fracture using
trochanteric femoral nail.
Packed Red Blood Cell Transfusion (2 units)


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 yo woman with h/o COPD, HTN, AFib on
Coumadin, who presented from home today after a mechanical fall.
Per the patient, she was walking to get her 3 PM medications and
tripped. She fell to the ground and hit a magazine rack. She did
not hit her head, and she did not lose consciousness. She called
for her husband, who immediately called EMS, and she was brought
to [**Hospital6 5016**] for further evaluation. XRays at [**Hospital 28941**] showed a left hip fracture and left humerus fracture. She
was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopedic evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient's initial VS were T 97.7, P 78, BP
126/84, R 18, O2 97% on 2L. She was given 1 L of NS and Dilaudid
2 mg IV. Ortho saw the patient in the ED, at which time she
desaturated to 90% on 2L. She had a CT Chest performed in the
ED, which did not show evidence of PE, and she had pelvic and
humerus XRays, which showed the fractures mentioned above. Her
VS at the time of transfer were T 97.6, P 85, BP 103/49, O2 93%
on 2L.
.
On the floor, the patient states that she feels dyspneic and
continues to have significant pain in her left arm and left hip.
On further questioning, she states that she is able to walk up
1.5 flights of stairs without stopping from shortness of breath.
She denies any recent history of chest pain and she states that
her activity is limited by osteoarthritis in her knees. She is
able to walk approximately 10 minutes on a flat surface.

IMAGING:
Left Humerus XRAY:
Patient positioning is suboptimal, with persistent
internal shoulder rotation and elbow flexion. No overt
glenohuymeral
dislocation. There is a comminuted fracture of the proximal
humeral diaphysis, with valgus angulation and anteromedial
displacement of the distal fracture fragment by approximately
one-half shaft width. Two intervening butterfly fragments are
rotated and laterally displaced by approximately 4 cm. Diffuse
overlying soft tissue swelling. No radiopaque foreign bodies are
identified.  Visualized left lung normal. Markedly comminuted
and displaced fracture proximal humeral shaft.

Ab/Pelvic CT:
1. Mildly displaced comminuted intertrochanteric left femoral
fracture with surrounding hematoma and small left
femoroacetabular joint effusion.
2. Findings suspicious for nondisplaced sacral fracture.
Recommend
assessment with dedicated pelvic CT with attention to the
sacrum.
3. Free pelvic fluid.

CTA chest:
1. No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly.
3. Small ground glass nodule in the left upper lobe. If there
are risk
factors for malignancy such as smoking or a known prior history
of malignancy, the follow-up chest CT surveillance could be
considered in one year. Otherwise, follow-up is probably
unnecessary according to the [**Last Name (un) 8773**] society guidelines.

Intraoperative: 30 intraoperative radiographs of the left hip
were
obtained without radiologist present. A proximal gamma nail and
distal
interlocking screw are visualized.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73 yo woman with h/o COPD, AFib, HTN, who
presented s/p mechanical fall with left hip and humerus
fracture, her brief hospital course is as follows:
.
# PELVIC AND HUMERAL FRACTURES: The patient had a mechanical
fall and sustained left-sided humeral and left comminuted
inter-and sub-trochanteric fractures. She was seen by orthopedic
surgery in the ED, who recommend surgery the following morning
for her femur, non-operative management of the arm. Per the
Revised [**Doctor Last Name **] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the patient had one
independent predictor of perioperative cardiac complications
(history of heart failure), so her risk of cardiac death,
nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest was
approximately 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent). Based on
AHA/ACC guidelines, patient can tolerate > 4 METS of activity.
For intermediate risk surgery, she did not need further cardiac
testing prior to surgery and could proceed with orthopedic
surgery. Her pain was controlled prior to the surgery with
Tylenol RTC and Dilaudid 0.5 mg q3h prn. She had surgery on
[**2126-2-21**] for a fixation of left intertrochanteric hip fracture
using trochanteric femoral nail. She was placed in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8688**]
brace for her humerus fracture. Post surgically her pain was
controlled with standing tylenol, oxycodone and a lidoderm
patch.  PT was consulted and saw the patient on the morning of
[**2-21**].  She was started on lovenox for post-surgical DVT ppx as
well as on her coumadin (her INR was reversed for the
procedure).  Plan was for lovenox until she becomes therpeutic
on coumadin. She was also placed on calcium and vitamin D.
.
# HYPOXIA: Episodes of hypoxia were likely multi-factorial. In
the ED she appeared fluid overloaded on physical exam with 1+
edema bilaterally, orthopnea, hypoxia, and elevated JVD. She has
a history of mitral regurgitation and was given at least 1L of
NS in the ED. She currently takes Lasix 20 mg daily at home and
per report gets yearly TTEs by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was given lasix for
diuresis and supplemental oxygen and her hypoxia resolved
overnight. The following morning she was evaluated by our team,
anesthia and orthopedics. She was felt to be safe to go to the
OR on [**2126-2-21**]. The patient was transferred to the MICU from the
PACU after her ORIF due to difficulty weaning from the
ventilator.  She was extubated shortly after she arrived in the
MICU was placed on NC.  It was thought her difficulty with
ext
