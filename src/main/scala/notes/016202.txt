Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old male with anoxic brain injury s/p likely vfib
arrest, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis three times a
week (monday, wednesday, friday), hypertension, and type two
presenting from rehab with shortness of breath and chest pain.

# Chest Pain: Intial chest xray shows bilateral multiple
inflitrates concerning for fluid overload from flash pulmonary
edema. While acute coronary syndrome was a concern, troponins
were initially around baseline without evidence of EKG changes.
While in the MICU he was treated with a nitroprusside drip given
his hypertension to 220's systolic and underwent hemodialysis
with the removal of 3.3 liters. His chest pain and shortness of
breath resolved. Repeat EKG's and cardiac markers were
unconcerning for a cardiac etiology.

# Respiratory distress: Pt likely volume overloaded from renal
failure and superimposed congestive heart failure exacerbation
given elevated BNP, appearance of CXR, hypertension and history
of similar episodes. His respiratory status improved with
hemodialysis and nebulizers of albuterol and ipratropium. On day
of discharge, he was dialyzed and 1.8L were removed. It appears
that this is a recurrent process which may be related to
inability to fully ultrafiltrate patient because BPs tend to
fall. ****It is important that patient receive antihypertensives
after dialysis sessions.**** [**Hospital1 **] Dialysis team will communicate
with outpatient nephrologist.

# End Stage Renal Disease: On hemodialysis monday, wednesday,
and friday. While in the MICU we renally dosed his medication
and treated him with Nephrocaps, calcium acetate, Vitamin D. On
day of discharge, 1.9L were dialyzed off. For further comments
see above.

# Hypertension: Pt was hypertensive to systolic blood pressure
of 220s on admission. Initially he was started on a
nitroglycerin drip to drop pre-load and underwent dialysis for
volume removal as above. He was continued on his home
amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol. His pulse pressure
remained high, likely secondary to his fistula.

# Coronary Artery Disease and Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:
No evidence of acute coronary syndrome on EKG. Tropnin leak
likely secondary to demand ischemia. He was constinued on his
[**Last Name (un) **] medications one dialysis was complete. His BNP was elevated
suggesting a acute CHF exacerbation. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 116**] be
dietary indiscrestion or underlaying infection or inadequate
fluid removal during dialysis.

#Diabetes Mellitus: Chronic issue. Placed on insulin sliding
scale.

#Glaucoma: Chronic issue. Continued outpatient eyedrops.

Transitional Issues:
1) Please check CBC on Wednseday [**9-6**] to follow up on mild
leukopenia.
2) Please be sure to give antihypertensives after diaylsis
sessions per renal recommendations.
