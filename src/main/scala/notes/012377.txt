Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86y/o F with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG  86F with
CAD s/p CABG [**10/2189**] (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD), AS s/p valvuloplasty
[**11-3**], diastolic CHF, AF on coumadin, s/p R colectomy [**12-6**]
admitted with generalized tonic clonic seizure. Her recent past
medical history inculdes an admission [**11-3**] for a history of
worsening DOE with AS with valve area of 0.56cm2. She underwent
valvuloplasty with subsequent diameter of 0.98cm2. Her course
was complicated by LGI bleed and on colonoscopy a precancerous
2cm cecal polyp was found. She was then admitted from 1/11-20/10
for right hemicolectomy. Low-grade T2N0M0 well or moderately
differentiatedadenocarcinoma. Her hospital course ([**2195-12-7**]-
[**2195-12-16**]) was complicated by hypercarbia requiring intubation and
fluid overload requiring diuresis. Subsequent to this she
developed C. difficile colitis, for which she has been on PO
vancomycin since; she continued to complain of abdominal pain,
with fevers post op and had a CT in [**2195-12-28**], that revealed
slight increased fat stranding in the region of the sigmoid
colon at sites of diverticula, representing a mild case of
uncomplicated diverticulitis.

The patient was admitted on [**1-26**] to Neurology service after tonic
clonic seizure activity which resolved spontaneously. Her
daughter and husband were visiting her and they noticed a
self-limitted 5 minutes seizure, described as acute onset of
LOC, followed by whole body stiffens and later shaking. She was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and during her observation in the ED
she another 30 seconds GTC seizure. To stop the cluster she
received Ativan IV and later she was loaded with 1000mg of IV
Keppra. No further seizures in the ED. She was admitted to the
Neuro ICU for further management. She was initially treated with
broad spectrum abx including vancomycin/cipro/bactrim and
acyclovir for concern for meningitis/encephalitis. These were
stopped after approx 24 hours. LP was not pursued given elevated
INR on coumadin. CTA negative for CVA. She had no further
seizure activity. [**Hospital1 4338**] head demonstrated a focal area with high
signal intensity in the right superior parietal lobule.

On evening of [**1-28**] the patient triggered for altered mental
status and lethargy following head [**Date Range 4338**]. O2 sat found to be 84%
and HR 130s, SBPs in 80s. Lasix 10mg IV given with no
improvement. ABG 7.32/65/89/35. MICU consult was called and an
additional 30mg IV lasix given with metoprolol 5mg IV. AMS felt
most likely secondary to ativan given for head [**Date Range 4338**]. Repeat ABG
this am 7.35/63/72/36. Given continued tachypnea and hypoxia
requiring 4-5L NC, the patient was transferred to the CCU for
further managment. Temp spiked to 101 and cultures sent.

Imaging:

CT head [**1-26**] - FINDINGS: There is no acute hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or infarct. The ventricles and sulci are again
prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy. Note is made of
extensive [**Month/Day (2) 1106**] calcifications in the bilateral cavernous
carotid, vertebral, and leptomeningeal arteries. The paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There are no
fractures. The orbits and soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CTA head and neck ([**2196-1-26**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No acute infarction or hemorrhage.
2. Severe atherosclerotic narrowing of the distal right
vertebral artery and moderate-to-severe narrowing of both
cavernous internal carotid arteries. Small focus of
calcification in the Basilar A. close to ithe tip. Given the
extent of disease in the dominant right vertebral artery,
associated vertebrobasilar insufficiency cannot be excluded.
Further evlauation with MRA Neck with Gado can be considered for
temporal info regarding the direction of flow, if there is no
contra-indication to [**Month/Day/Year 4338**].
3. Moderate microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease

CXR [**1-26**] - IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. Opacity in the left
lower lobe may represent atelectasis or infection.

ECHO [**1-27**] - The left atrium is dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
