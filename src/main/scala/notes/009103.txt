Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-9-3**] Aortic valve replacement utilizing 21 millimeter
[**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine heart valve and three vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting(left internal mammary to left anterior
descending, vein graft to obtuse marginal, vein graft to
posterior descending artery).


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year old Chinese male with a one month history of
shortness of breath and orthopnea. In early [**2108-8-3**], he
experienced new onset congestive heart failure. He was admitted
to [**Hospital1 336**] and underwent further evaluation. Echocardiogram was
notable for an LVEF of 15% with 2-3+ aortic insufficiency. SPECT
study found a severe inferior defect consistent with no
significant viability. There was also a moderate-severe
anteroapical defect that had some viability. Subsequent cardiac
catheterization revealed severe three vessel coronary artery
disease with severely depressed left ventricular function.
Coronary angiography showed total occlusion of the left anterior
descending and right coronary arteries while the circumflex had
a 60% lesion. Ventriculogram revealed an LVEF of 20% with 2+
mitral regurgitation. Based on the above results, he was
referred for cardiac surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:
Congestive heart failure, Ischemic cardiomyopathy, Hypertension,
Mitral regurgitation, History of cholelithiasis - s/p
cholecystectomy

Quit tobacco over 30 years ago. Denies ETOH. Lives with wife and
son. [**Name (NI) 1403**] at a chinese restaurant.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was admitted and underwent an aortic valve replacement
utilizing 21 millimeter [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine heart valve and
three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting(left internal
mammary to left anterior descending, vein graft to obtuse
marginal, vein graft to posterior descending artery). Postop
transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no aortic insufficiency;
there was [**2-5**]+ mitral regurgitation and his jection fraction
continued to be 15%-20% after bypass. Cardiac output, however,
had increased to 3.7 liters per minute whereas it was 2.4 liters
per minute preoperatively. The operation was otherwise
uneventful and he transferred to the CSRU. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He weaned from
intravenous therapy without complication. He was then
transferred to the floor in stable condition and continued to
progress.  He was restarted on an ACE and Coreg and was d/c'd to
home on POD#5.
