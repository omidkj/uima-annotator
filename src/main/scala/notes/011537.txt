Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Heart Failure Exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 year old male with a complicated past
medical history, including bioprosthetic mitral valve ([**2170**]),
coronary artery
disease (s/p LAD CABG [**2170**]), congestive heart failure with
preserved LV function, severe pulmonary artery hypertension,
permanent atrial fibrillation, chronic right diaphragm
paralysis, s/p left pleural effusion and peel with VATS
decortication [**2173**] who presents with decompensated heart
failure.
.
The patient was hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2175-4-25**] through
[**2175-4-30**] with shortness of breath. This is felt to be secondary
to his pulmonary hypertension as well as decompensated diastolic
heart failure. The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**], and
pulmonary was consulted during that hospitalization. He was
continued on his home sildenafil, with the hope that adequate
diuresis and attention optimizing renal function and keeping his
Sat's at or over mid 90's he can get to and remain at his
basseline functional level. The patient was aggressively
diuresed in the hospital. The patient does have atrial
fibrillation for which he has been treated with Coumadin and
digoxin. The digoxin was discontinued as he was digoxin toxic.
The patient was having diarrhea during his hospitalization and
found to be positive for Clostridium difficile, and was treated
with a 14d course of flagyl. In subsequent follow up, the
patient had improved dyspnea, but still remained modestly fluid
overloaded. His diuretic regimen has underone continued
titration.
.
It is interesting to note that 3 weeks prior to presentation, he
was started by his pulmonology provider in [**Name9 (PRE) 108**] on
ambrisentan. Over the last 2 weeks, he has noted increasing
lower extremity edema. His weight continued to rise on his home
scale, with a dry weight of around 157 lbs now up to 167. It
seems metolazone had been added to his diurectic regimen, but he
continued to have worsening edema. He also reports mild increase
in fatigue and dyspnea. He has stable orthopnea. He denies any
fevers, chest pain, palipitations, and only stable
lightheadedness when rising to a standing position. With these
symptoms, the patient decided to return early from [**State 108**] for
medical evaluation.
.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, inital vitals were 97.4, 140/70, 80,
24, 96% on 2L. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
ED course. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for further
manegment.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
ECG Study Date of [**2175-6-18**]
Atrial fibrillation. Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Prior
anterolateral myocardial infarction. Consider also possible
right ventricular overload or possible left posterior fascicular
block. Modest inferior lead T wave changes are non-specific.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of
[**2175-4-26**] ventricular rate is faster. Otherwise, there is probably
no significant change.

1. Mild volume overload.
2. Confluent left lower lobe consolidation could reflect a
combination of
atelectasis, edema and effusion; however, superimposed pneumonia
is not
excluded.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2175-6-19**]
The left and right atria are markedly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic arch
and descending thoracic aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A well seated
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present with mobile
leaflets and normal gradient. No mitral regurgitation Moderate
[2] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-4-26**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly
lower. The other findings are similar.
