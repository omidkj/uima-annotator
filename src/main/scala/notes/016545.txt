History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 72-year-old female with PMHx afib on
coumadin, COPD on 2L NC, DM and dCHF presenting with shortness
of breath. She was in her usual state of health until the
afternoon of admission when she began to feel fatigued and out
of breath while going to bathroom. Symptoms worsened throughout
the afternoon; she tried increasing her oxygen to 6L to no
relief. She called her PCP who recommended that she come to ED.
Otherwise, denies fevers/chills, chest pain. Did have worsening
pedal edema at home.
.
In the ED, she was placed on bipap, initially 10/5/50% which was
weaned to 30% prior to transfer to the MICU. She received nebs,
125mg iv solumedrol. CXR was unremarkable. BNP was not elevated.
She received 20mg iv lasix (takes 20mg po lasix at home) with
450cc UOP at ED and then another 500cc on arrival to floor. In
the ED, BPs were elevated to systolic 200s. She had not taken
any of her medications today, including her BP meds. She was
given SL nitro x 2 with SBP decreasing to 140s. SBP then arose
to 170s and she was placed on nitro gtt. She was admitted to the
MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, was net negative 1L. She rapidly
improved and was called out to the floor.
.
On the floor, initial VS were:
T 98 BP 173/78 HR 68 RR 23 O2 Sat 98% 3L NC
She stated that her breathing felt back at her baseline. No
other complaints.

CXR
FINDINGS: Single AP portable view of the chest is compared to
previous exam from [**2197-3-22**]. Again seen is eventration of
the right hemidiaphragm.  Instinct pulmonary vascular markings
suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion. Blunting of the left
lateral costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissues
and technique. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable
compared to prior. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unchanged, noting degenerative changes at the left glenohumeral
joint. IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular
congestion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission: 72-year-old female with afib on
coumadin, COPD on 2L NC, DM, diastolic CHF presenting with
shortness of breath.
.
# Hypoxia: Most likely due to flash pulmonary edema given HTN
and rapid improvement with afterload reduction and BiPAP. HTN
crisis thought to be secondary to medication non-compliance. In
the MICU she was treated with Nitro gtt, Prednisone 60mg PO x1,
standing Albuterol/Ipratroprium and Lasix 20mg IV. Her O2
requirement returned to her home dose (2L NC) and she was called
out to the floor. Nitro gtt was stopped. On the floor, steroids
were d/c'ed and Lasix was held. She was likely not volume
overloaded, as her Cr increased with only 1L of diruesis in the
MICU. Rather, her presenation was more likely due to an acute
change in LV compliance due to high afterload, causing flash
pulm edema. Because of rising creatinine, her lasix was held at
time of discharge, and should be restarted soon. She has PCP f/u
in a few days after d/c. She has a history of dCHF, but no
cardiologist. We arranged cards f/u given this admission and her
HTN issues.
.
# Hypertension: Hypertensive to systolic 200s on admission. She
was placed on a Nitro gtt with marked improvement in her BP. Her
Lasix and Digoxin were held for [**Last Name (un) **]. Her home Amlodipine was
continued, with labetolol used for breakthrough HTN. This was
switched to metoprolol succinate at discharge. HCTZ and ACEi
were held at time of discharge, [**2-15**] [**Last Name (un) **]. She will have very
close PCP f/u, who can do lab check and restart these meds when
safe.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely pre-renal related to diuresis. Cr 2.2 on
discharge. Previously had been 1.5-1.7, however, there is a
suggestion from Cr trend that 2.0 may be closer to her new
baseline. , though this is unclear. We held ACEi, digoxin, and
HCTZ for now, and arranged very close PCP f/u to check her renal
function and consider restarting these medications soon.
.
# DM: Her Lantus was continued. She was placed on ISS in house.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Her Dig level on admission was 1.8, which
is above goal for her. Her Digoxin was stopped [**2-15**] [**Last Name (un) **], and also
unclear indication given dCHF. Metoprolol succinate was started
for HTn control and rate control in place of dig. Her Coumadin
was continued at a recently increased dose of 7mg daily, though
she became supratherapeutic so coumadin was held for a day, then
INR dropped to 1.5. We discharged her on 6mg coumadin daily, w/
close PCP f/u and plan for INR check on Friday.
