Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status
38 M with alcoholic hepatitis, recently admitted for altered
mental status and PNA, found to have a new cardiomyopathy felt
to be related to EtOH, although viral idiopathic cardiomyopathy
also possible, with LVEF=15% and also bilateral PE with RV
strain, now on coumadin, who presents to the ED with AMS in
setting of diarrhea and dehydration. Most of the history is
obtained from the patient's wife given his mental status. She
reports that since his discharge on [**7-19**], he has had soft BMs
which have since become explosive diarrhea for the last [**3-21**]
days, associated with decreased PO intake. Wife reports that he
has been less mentally sharp for last 6 weeks (cannot remember
ATM password etc) and has never returned to baseline of being
very functional.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.6 86 82/53 18 96% 4L NC. He was
triggered for hypotension (SBP in 70s) and AMS. Physical exam
was notable for asterixis, no ascites, FOBT negative. Bedside
ultrasound showed no evidence of pericardial effusion. INR was
noted to be 19.2 (2.1 on [**7-28**]), WBC=19.3 with left shift,
Cr=5.8, BUN 91. CXR showed no new pneumonia and RUQ U/S showed
no ascites and patent portal vein. EKG without ischemic changes.
He was given vancomycin and zosyn, protonix bolus, lactulose
40g. He also received 6L IVF, reportedly with no variation in
the IVC on ultrasound, suggesting adequate volume resuscitation.
His SBPs remained in the 80s-90s, however, and peripheral
dopamine was started and changed to norepinephrine (0.09
mcg/min) in the setting of tachycardia. No CVL was placed given
elevated INR and he received 10mg IV Vitamin K and 2 units FFP.
He also received one dose of stress dose hydrocortisone given
concern for adrenal insufficiency. UOP was 200cc in ED. VS at
time of transfer: 97.0 93 85/59 12 100% 2L NC.
.
In the ICU, the patient is confused but mentating. He has no
specific complaints.
.
Review of systems:  Unobtainable.
