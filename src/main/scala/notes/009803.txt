Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is an 84F with emphysema, CAD, cardiomyopathy who
presents with 3-4 days subacute dyspnea, mildly productive
cough, and low grade fever.  She felt otherwise well until two
days prior to admission when she developed cough, worsening SOB,
and wheezing over the course of the day.  Her cough was
productive of yellow phlegm.  She uses 2L 02 at home at night,
but had to increase it to 3L.  She also admitted to increased
fatigue, being unable to ambulate as well with her walker.
Additionally, she described low grade fever as well but never
took her temp.  She denied sinus congestion, CP,
nausea/vomitting, abd pain, leg pain or swelling, orthopnea,
travel or sick contacts.  At baseline, patient lives alone and
is able to carry out ADLs and IALDs.  She denies anginal pain or
lightheadedness with exertion.  She denies symptoms of chronic
bronchitis but says that she has been admitted to the hospital
with pneumonia 3 times in the last six months.
.
In the ED, T 99.9, HR 96, BP 117/53, RR 26, 92% 3L.  BP ranged
from 90-105 systolic, given 2L NS.  HR improved to 80s.  Pt
given Levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 as well as nebulizers.  High
lactate eventually normalized after 2L fluids.  EKG unchanged
from prior.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt immediately triggered for BP 82/palp
bilat, HR 80s, RR 26.  Pt asymtpomatic, denying dizziness, CP,
worsened SOB or bleeding from anywhere.  Brief exam was notable
for dry MM, relatively clear lungs with prolonged exp phase,
cough.  With 500ml NS, BP improved to 96/40.  Labs/EKG redrawn.

Brief Hospital Course:
# HYPOXIA/COPD EXACERBATION AND MRSA ASPIRATION PNA:
Patient was admitted for worsening SOB, fevers, and productive
cough. CXR showed an infiltrate at RLL. She was started on
Levaquin for presumed community aquired pneumonia. There was
also concern that she may have aspirated given her recent speech
and swallow evaluation. Based on physical exam and CXR, she did
not seem significantly fluid overloaded although her EF is ~40%.
She denied any chest pain and cardiac enzymes were negative and
her EKG was unchanged so this was unlikely an acute cardiac
event. Pulmonary embolism was also on the differential but low
on the differential since the patient was ambulatory at home and
had no other risk factors.  Although d-dimer was elevated in the
MICU, LE dopplers were negative for DVT.
.
She was started on vancomycin for MRSA in sputum in addition to
the levaquin she was receiving for empiric treatment of CAP.
She received albuterol and ipratropium nebs at standing order
doses, and was also written for acetylcysteine and guaifenesin.
During the hospital course, her oxygen requirements increased
and she was transferred to the MICU briefly for BiPAP.  At time
of transfer back to the floors, she was satting in mid 90s on 6L
nasal cannula.  She was gradually weaned off of 02 until time of
discharge, at which time her O2 sats were stable on 3L NC O2
with sats of 92-94%. Given her history of emphysema, the goal
for her would be to keep her O2 sat between 90-92%, and not
higher as she would be at risk for CO2 retaining. Her home
baseline NC O2 prior to hospitalization was 2L NC O2 at night.
.
During her time in the MICU, patient was started on IV
solumedrol for treatment of possible COPD exacerbation.  It was
also during this time that her abx regimen was broadened to
include vancomycin in addition to levoquin.  She finished her 7
day course of vancomycin/levaquin by discharge and was
discharged on a slow prednisone taper of 8 days duration.  The
patient should recieve:
40mg x 2 days
30mg x 2 days
20mg x 2 days
10mg x 2 days.
.
# Oral Thrush: The patient reported a slight sore throat and had
some evidence of oral [**Female First Name (un) **], she was started on lidocaine and
nystatin swish and spit. The nystatin can be discontinued in [**4-8**]
days or as symptoms resolve.
.
# BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL:
On admission, patient was hypotensive with SBP 100s. Her BP
improved with IVF boluses. Baseline BP per OMR records is
120-130s/80. She likely had early sepsis physiology and met SIRS
criteria on admission. She never required pressors during time
in the MICU.  At time of transfer back to floors her SBP is
100-120s with hypotension resolved.  Her antihypertensives were
held in the ICU but as her BP normalized, she was restarted on
lisinopril which was slowly titrated up to 10mg PO daily at
discharge.
.
# AF WITH RVR:
While in the MICU, patient had brief period of atrial
fibrillation that resolved with electrical cardioversion and
digoxin loading. The likely cause was critical illness, unlikely
to be permanent (PAF) but her ECHO was repeated showing systolic
ventricular function of 40%. The patient was started on digoxin
after a load to improve her cardiac function. She would also
likely benefit from anticoagulation treatment with coumadin,
which the patient is amenable to. The patient was started on
coumadin 5mg PO daily and should be continued on this with INR
monitoring with follow up with an [**Hospital3 **]/PCP for
coumadin adjusting.
.
# CAD:
Continued home ASA.
.
# DEPRESSION:
Continued home Celexa,
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
Continued simvastatin at home dose.
.
# ACCESS:
Midline was placed in the MICU.  PICC was placed when placed for
anticipated IV antibiotics. However, as patient finished her
antibiotic course in the hospital, PICC line was discontinued at
discharge.
.
#. CODE STATUS: The patient was initially admitted with wishes
to be DNR/DNI per discussion on the floor with the patient.
After the patient had her episode of respiratory distress
leading to transfer to the ICU, a family discussion was held
including the patient and her sons, which led to her code status
to be reversed to full code. The patient was never intubated in
the ICU. After transfer back to the floor, code status and goals
of care were readdressed and the patient wishes to continue as
full code at this time. FULL CODE.
