Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Arterial line

History of Present Illness:
72 yo M w/ hx COPD on home O2, CAD, dementia was noted to have
increasing dyspnea at NSH w/ hypoxia to 84% on 2L NC improved on
NRB w/ CXR read as b/l infiltrates. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital 4068**]
Hospital. Pt received levo/flagyl/vanco, KCl and IV NS and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.  Pt
has a PEG and is allowed to have nectar liquid shake under
supervision w/ family or staff. He has been NPO for the past few
days, however unclear whether pt's family has been feeding him
as well.
Pt reports increasing SOB over a week, no cough or fevers, no
dysuria. He also reports diarrhea x 1 week, now improving. He
reports no PO intake in the last week. He reports his breathing
was difficult, but slightly easier now compared w/ earlier.

Patient was admitted to the MICU, intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure, found to have pneumonia (asp?), COPD flare,
anemia, renal insufficiency. Was extubated easily and on
transfer to the medical floor was breathing well on 3L NC.

Reports:
[**2122-5-16**] Cardiology ECG
Sinus rhythm; Low limb leads voltage; Modest nonspecific low
amplitude lateral T waves; Since previous tracing of [**2122-5-7**],
probably no significant change

[**2122-5-15**] Radiology CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS
1) No intussusception. The Foley catheter now terminates in the
body of the stomach.
2) Large right common iliac artery aneurysm.
3) Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4) Large cystic spaces at the right lung bases.
5) Atelectasis or consolidation at the left lung base.

[**2122-5-14**] Radiology CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS
1) Likely transient intussusception of proximal jejunum caused
by an inflated Foley balloon used as a gastrostomy tube which
has migrated distally. These findings were immediately conveyed
to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**].
2) Large 6 cm right common iliac artery aneurysm. 3cm supra- and
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.
3) Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
4) Two tiny low attenuation lesions at the head of the pancreas
as above. These most likely represent benign cysts. However,
IPMT cannot be excluded. Follow-up CT or MRI in 1 year is
recommended to ensure stability.

[**2122-5-13**] Radiology PORTABLE ABDOMEN
2 mm calcific density in the right mid abdomen, which may
represent a kidney stone.

[**2122-5-12**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
1. Worsening interstitial pattern in the mid and lower lung
zones, which may represent pulmonary edema in this patient with
history of volume overload clinically.
2. Persistent left retrocardiac process, which may relate to
either atelectasis or pneumonia. Infection is within the
differential diagnosis.
3. Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema.

[**2122-5-11**] Radiology CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
1) Persistent left lower lobe process, which may reflect
combination of infectious consolidation and atelectasis. There
is slight interval improvement along the periphery, allowing for
differences in technique.
2) Diffuse emphysematous changes.
3) Nonspecific 4 mm right lower lobe noncalcified nodule. In the
absence of prior studies, follow up CT scan is recommended in
one year to ensure stability.
4) Focal aneurysmal dilation of the descending aorta measuring
3.5 cm in diameter.

[**2122-5-7**] Cardiology ECG [**2122-5-8**]
Sinus rhythm. Borderline low voltages of QRS and T waves. These
findings are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2122-5-7**] sinus tachycardia and
atrial ectopy are absent and ST-T wave abnormalities have
decreased.

[**2122-5-7**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Pulmonary edema/CHF with probable superimposed consolidation of
the left lower lobe.

[**2122-5-7**] Radiology PORTABLE ABDOMEN
1) Moderate gastric distention, without evidence of bowel
obstruction or significant bowel ileus.
2) Left lung base atelectasis/consolidation.

[**2122-5-6**] Cardiology ECG
Sinus tachycardia; Supraventricular extrasystoles; Short PR
interval;
Poor R wave progression - probable normal variant; Nonspecific
ST-T wave changes

[**2122-5-6**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
1) Probable left lower lobe pneumonia. A PA and lateral view
will be helpful for further assessment once the patient's
condition permits.
2) Bleb at the right medial lung.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Assessment of the
lungs demonstrates diffuse severe emphysematous changes with
both paraseptal and centrilobular distribution. Marked bullous
changes are also demonstrated at the apices. Consistent with the
prior chest x-rays, there is a consolidation in the medial
aspect of the left lower lobe with air bronchograms as well as
volume loss. Allowing for differences in technique, there is
suggestion of gradual improvement along the peripheral aspect of
this consolidation. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion
and trace right- sided effusion. An endotracheal tube is noted
in satisfactory position. A small calcified right upper lobe
granuloma is noted. A 4 mm noncalcified nodule is also noted in
the right lower lobe abutting the pleura on series 2, image 22.

There are no pathologically enlarged areas of adenopathy. A
calcified right paratracheal and right hilar lymph node are
noted, also consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Note
is made of coronary artery calcifications. The visualized great
vessels are remarkable for a focal aneurysmal dilatation of the
descending aorta at the
