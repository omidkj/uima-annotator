Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 82 year old female with history of  diastolic CHF, HTN,
DM2, HL, hypothyroid who was recently admitted for CHF
exacerbation and UTI now readmitted for SOB.
.
# Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Pt had a recent ECHO
performed at [**Hospital1 18**] which showed grade [**2-13**] diastolic congestive
heart failure.  It is likely that pt's current presentation was
c/w CHF secondary to HTN/LVH. Patient had an episode of SOB on
[**7-23**] and was given 20mg PO Lasix, to which her SOB resolved.
Patient's CXR at this time was also consistent with increased
pulmonary edema, and the CXR improved after her dose of Lasix.
Patient's Labetalol was changed to Metoprolol HCL 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **],
and this was then changed to Toprol XL 25 mg daily.  She was
also started on Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, and her Lasix was
increased to 40 mg daily.  Patient tolerated these medications
changes well and did not have any episodes of orthostatic
hypotension or further episodes of shortness of breath.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease/Ischemia: Pt does not have any known
CAD or history of  MI. However, pt with extensive history of
PVD including stent to R.ICA, right renal artery stenosis and
various stenosis of abdominal vessels. Pt was without symptoms
of CP on this admission, but her troponins and CK were slightly
elevated, which was thought to be secondary to her acute on
chronic renal failure.  Patient had an ECG performed, which was
normal.  Her troponins decreased during this admission, and she
was continued on her home doses of aspirin, Plavix, and
atorvastatin.  She remained chest pain free throughout the
duration of this hospital stay.

# HTN: Pt has a history of hypertension.  Per neurology,
patient's optimal systolic blood pressure is 120-140.  Patient
was on nifedipine, labetalol, and Lasix at home.  Patient was
started on Metoprolol XL 25 mg daily, Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily,
and Lasix 40 mg daily during this hospital course, and she
tolerated these medication changes well.  She did not have any
acute events during this hospital stay.
.
# ARF. Patient's Cr was 1.2 on her last admission, and had
increased to 2.1 upon discharge.  Patient was found to have
right-sided renal artery stenosis.  Patient was admitted with a
Cr of 2.6, which was likely secondary to R. RAS in the setting
of Lasix and Bactrim therapy (for UTI).  Patient was seen by
nephrology and vascular surgery, who advised against
intervention on her renal artery stenosis, due to the fact that
her right kidney had already significantly atrophied.  Patient
was diuresed with Lasix, and her Cr. decreased to 1.9.  Patient
remained stable during this hospital course, and did not have
any acute events.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Pt's TSH was found to be elevated on her last
admission. her Synthroid dose was increased.  She did not have
any acute events relating to her hypothyroidism during this
admission, and she will be seen by her PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 702**]..
.
# Type 2 Diabetes:  Patient has a history of type 2 Diabetes.
She was maintained on a sliding scale insulin during this
admission, and did not have any acute events while in the
hospital.
.
# Code:  full. Discussed with pt's husband and family.
