Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers/chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62-year-old male with elevated PSA s/p prostate biopsy [**2142-6-20**]
presenting with urosepsis. Pt had elevated prostate that went
from 1.8 in [**2141-2-11**] to 4.7 in [**2142-2-11**] and underwent prostate
biopsy on [**2142-6-20**] at urologist's office. He took ciprofloxacin
prior to the procedure, on day of procedure, and the following
day as instructed. Procedure was uncomplicated; pt had minimal
pain at base of penis afterwards. He awoke the next morning with
fevers/chills and rigors as well as dysuria and hematuria.
States that urine was frankly bloody that has cleared more with
IVFs. He presented to PCP's office where he was noted to be
febrile with leukocytosis (WBC 14) and was sent to ED for
further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 128 118/75 18 98%RA. He was
febrile to 102.3 and was sinus tachycardic to 140s. He received
a total of 4L normal saline as well as 1g IV vancomycin, 1g IV
ceftriaxone, and 1mg PO acetaminophen. He was admitted to the
MICU. Urology saw him in the MICU and recommended empiric
vanc/cefepime and to follow his urine and blood Cx.

Overnight in the MICU he had blood pressures in 80s. A RIJ
central line was attempted but was unsuccessful. Blood Cx grew
GNR in [**5-16**] bottles. He was dyspneic overnight and felt better on
BiPAP. He was weaned to 3L NC and transferred to the medical
floor.

Imaging:
CXR [**2142-6-27**]:
Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  As compared to
prior radiograph, there is new right lower and right mid lobe
opacities, that might reflect interval development of multifocal
infectious process.  There are otherwise unchanged clear lungs.
There is small amount of pleural effusion.  There is no
pneumothorax.  Although the findings might reflect improved
aspiration/pulmonary edema, the current focal nature is highly
concerning for infectious process and should be further
monitored.

Renal ultrasound [**2142-6-27**]:
No hydronephrosis and no renal collection identified.  Tiny
caliceal
diverticulum with crystal incidentally noted in the right
kidney.

CXR [**2142-6-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Since [**2140-6-14**], mild pulmonary edema has further
improved, and persisting right infrahilar and left lower lung
opacities, either represents residual edema and/or infection.
Further clinical correlation is need and should be appropriately
followed up on radiograph to monitor resolution. Paradoxic to
improved pulmonary edema, bilateral, small, pleural effusions
are new.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal,
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.

RUQ U/S [**2142-6-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No gallstones.
2.  Focal adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder fundus.
3.  Mild splenomegaly.

Prostate U/S [**2142-6-25**]:
IMPRESSION:  No focal abnormalities identified on the endorectal
ultrasound exam within the prostate gland.  The CT abnormality
may thus represent a focal area of inflammation or even hematoma
from a recent biopsy.

CT abdomen [**2142-6-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Periprostatic inflammation and focal hypodensity in the
right aspect of the gland, which could represent post-biopsy
changes, but developing abscess cannot be excluded.  Consider
endorectal ultrasound or MR prostate for further evaluation.
2.  Nonspecific lingular opacity and small pleural effusions.

CXR [**2142-6-23**]:
FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement persists, but previously
demonstrated pulmonary edema has substantially improved with
residual asymmetrical hazy perihilar opacities, worse on the
right than the left as well as a few scattered bilateral septal
lines.  Small pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o man with elevated PSA s/p prostate biopsy [**2142-6-20**] who
presented to the MICU in urosepsis, transferred to the floor
with blood and urine cultures growing ESBL E.coli.

1. ESBL E.Coli septicemia [**3-15**] UTI: In the MICU the patient met
SIRS criteria for urosepsis after undergoing a prostate biopsy
on [**2142-6-20**]. Most likely he had acute bacterial prostatitis as
complication of the prostate biopsy. U/A was grossly positive
with WBCs and RBCs and urine Cx grew E. coli. He was started on
IV Vanc/Cefepime for empiric coverage, and was transferred to
the floor on [**6-22**]. Vancomycin was discontinued. Sensitivities
from his blood culture performed on [**6-21**] returned on [**6-23**] and
noted ESBL E. coli that was sensitive to meropenem. ID was
consulted and his antibiotics were switched from cefepime to
meropenem on [**6-23**]. One blood culture from [**6-24**] grew gram
negative rods, but all subsequent surveillance blood cultures
were negative. The patient did have one isolated fever to 101.1
on [**6-26**], which may partly have been due to development of a
hospital-acquir
