##
CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] [**2181-2-12**]:
1. Large left perinephric and subcapsular hematoma which
displaces and compresses the left kidney medially. Multiple foci
of active extravasation are demonstrated within the left
perinephric space. The hematoma extends to the retroperitoneum
bilaterally.
2. The left renal vein at the left hilum is not well visualized,
and this may be due to compression of the vein by the left
perinephric hematoma or formation of thrombus within this
region.
3. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically. Bilateral renal cysts and
renal calculi are demonstrated without evidence of
hydronephrosis.
4. Small amount of hemoperitoneum noted within the perihepatic
space likely related to the large retroperitonal hematoma.
5. Bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.
##
Angio [**2181-2-12**]:
1. Selective left renal arteriography revealed active contrast
extravasation from two areas arising from the cortical surface
of the lower half of the left kidney.
2. Successful superselective gelfoam embolization of three left
renal artery branches where the extravasation was identified,
with good immediate angiographic results.
3. Selective left L1, L2, and L3 lumbar arteriography without
evidence of extravasation or vascular abnormality.
4. Left iliac arteriography was performed and showed no evidence
of extravasation or vascular abnormality from the branches of
the hypogastric, external iliac, or common femoral arteries.
##
CXR [**2181-2-28**]:
Decrease of bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar
atelectasis. Left lower lobe opacity, probably representing
atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be totally excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the TSICU after undergoing an
angiogram with embolization for his left kidney fracture. He was
placed on a CIWA scale, ativan as needed and dilaudid for the
pain. The patient developed delirium tremens with severe
tremors, agitation and was tachycardic to 140s on HD#2
refractory to ativan, metoprolol, IVF boluses. The patient was
sedated and intubated until HD#13. Once extubated, the patient
was placed on oral pain medications with good results.
##
RENAL: The patient's angiogram revealed bleeding cortical
vessels. This was embolized with gelfoam. Repeat hematocrit
levels showed moderate drops corrected with a series of blood
transfusions. A repeat angiogram did not reveal further
bleeding. An IVC filter was placed for his history of DVT.
##
CV: The patient was placed on metoprolol with good control on
his hypertension. An echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection
fraction. He was also placed in lasix for diureses as his fluid
balance remained positive in the initial phase of his
hospitalization. A clonidine patch was also added to his
regimen. A lower extremity ultrasound did not reveal any DVT.
##
PULM: The patient developed atelectasis and consolidation in the
left lower lobe during his ICU stay requiring a course of
antibiotics. He was weaned off the ventilator on HD#13 with no
complications after failed prior attempts at extubation due to
episodes of hypoxemia and tachypnea.
##
ID: The patient grew Gram positive cocci from his arterial line
after her spiked a fever at 101.7 on HD#3. He was started on
vancomycin and later on levofloxacin due to a possible
infiltrate of the left lower lobe and staph coagulase negative
growth in the urine. The vancomycin was discontinued on HD#8 and
replaced by clindamycin. Levofloxacin was discontinued on HD#10
and oxacillin was started once sputum culture sensitivities
returned. On HD#9, the patient developed herpetic lesions on his
lips and was started on acyclovir. All antibiotics were
discontinued on HD#11. On [**2-27**], the patient developed a fever of
101.2. His right subclavian line was removed and sent for
culture. Urine and blood cultures remained negative. He
developed a flare of his gout prior to discharge and treated
with colchicine.
##
ORTHO: The patient's forehead laceration was sutured in the
emergency department and his sutures were removed on HD#6. No
other issues were uncovered.
##
EtOH: The patient was under prophylaxis with ativan and, despite
that, developed DTs in the ICU requiring intubation and
sedation. This resolved after the initial few days of ICU care.
He remained stable in that aspect throughout his hospital stay
thereafter. The patient discussed his drinking problem with
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 54184**], our social worker, and agreed to seek for help
to overcome this problem.
##
DISPO: The patient was discharged in stable condition to a
rehabilitation facility.
