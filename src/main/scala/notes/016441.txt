HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male
who presents with bright red blood per rectum and drop in
hematocrit.  The patient has multiple medical problems at
baseline including hypertension, monoclonal gammopathy, and
he has multiple medical admissions over the past year for
E. coli bacteremia, epidural abscess with diskitis and
osteomyelitis, requiring diskectomy and long-term IV
antibiotics.  Then, he had gram-negative rod infection of his
left hip prosthesis requiring hardware removal in [**2144-10-5**].  More recently, the patient was hospitalized from
[**11-28**] to [**12-4**] for shortness of breath and
non-Q-wave MI with echocardiographic evidence of decreased
left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction of
approximately 23% and cardiac catheterization showing no sign
of flow-limited lesion; 30% stenosis of LAD).  The patient
had been discharged to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital on
Captopril, Digoxin, Aldactone, beta blocker, diuretics,
aspirin, and Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.  The patient had
been doing well at [**Location **] until one day prior to admission
when it was noted by the [**Hospital **] medical doctor to be in mild
pulmonary edema.  He was given Lasix, but the shortness of
breath persisted.  On the morning of admission, the patient
was found to have anterior ST depressions on EKG, drop in
hematocrit from 31, ten days prior, to 20.  He had also had
history of bright red blood per rectum several times over the
past week.  He had grossly guaiac-positive stool in the
emergency room.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was, otherwise, notable
only for four days of upper respiratory symptoms and a cough
productive of green sputum.

[**Last Name (Titles) 33150**]; lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 8**].  There are two grown
daughters, one of whom is an medical doctor.

FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.7; blood pressure 101/51; pulse
95; respiration 12; oxygen saturation 100% on rebreather.
GENERAL:  In general, the patient is a cachectic, white male,
who appeared diaphoretic and anxious in respiratory distress
with cool extremities.  Neck was supple.  External jugular
vein was full and it was difficult to assess his jugular
venous distention, since the patient was supine.  Heart was
regular with normal S1 and S2 and an S3 was audible.  Lungs
had rales audible at the bases bilaterally.  He had bronchial
breath sounds in the mid-lung field on the left.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel sounds;
no masses appreciable.  Skin was cool and diaphoretic.
Extremities were cool and mottled.  He had weak pedal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
White count 8.0, hematocrit 20.6, platelet count 180; sodium
132; potassium 4.5; chloride 97; bicarbonate 25, BUN 65;
creatinine 0.9; glucose 143, PT 9.6; INR 2.5, PTT 43.6.
Initial CK was 190 with MB fraction of 28 for an index of
14.7, initial troponin 22.9.  Chest x-ray revealed tortuous
aorta, cardiomegaly, hilar prominence on the right with fluid
in the right fissure.  The interstitium appeared congested
with no large pleural effusions.

The EKG revealed the following:  Normal sinus rhythm at 98
beats per minute with normal axis; intraventricular
conduction delay; and ST elevations of 1-mm in leads V1 to
V2, and ST depressions in V4 through V6 of 3-mm.  Compared
with the previous EKG, there was no much change, but in the
previous EKG, the patient had a troponin level of more than
20.  When compared to the EKG from [**Month (only) **], the patient then had
no intraventricular conduction delay and no ST elevations or
depressions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the emergency room, the patient's blood
pressure declined to 69/37 and the oxygen saturation also
worsened.  He was started on a dopamine drip and in this
setting he became increasingly diaphoretic, agitated and
confused.  He was, therefore, intubated for airway protection
and hypoxia.  He was given Ativan and Haldol for sedation.  A
central venous catheter was placed in his right  internal
jugular vein, which was later changed to a Cordis for
placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter.  The patient was given
packed red blood cells quickly and he was transfused a total
of four units on his first night as he was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and revealed initial readings
which showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 24, PA
pressure of 46/27, central venous pressure of 11, cardiac
output of 3.6, cardiac index of 1.8, and systemic vascular
resistance of 1326.  These values were on 9 mcg per minute of
dopamine.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course by system is
as follows:

#1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was felt to be in
cardiogenic shock secondary to a non-Q-wave MI in the setting
of demand ischemia from his fallen hematocrit.  His pulmonary
function was supported with dobutamine, which improved his
cardiac output by Swan-Ganz catheter.  As the dobutamine was
weaned off, however, the patient experienced worsening
congestive heart failure and worsening renal perfusion.
Therefore, the dobutamine was restarted and Hydralazine was
added in an effort to afterload reduce his obviously failing
heart.  The patient's blood pressure remained relatively low
due to his poor cardiac output and Digoxin was started in an
effort to improved his cardiac output.

At discharge, the patient's dopamine had been weaned off, but
he was still requiring dobutamine for inotropic support.  As
far as his heart rhythm, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation, which was new for him while on dobutamine.  He
did not respond to IV Diltiazem.  DC cardioversion was also
attempted without success.  He was then loaded on Amiodarone
with the hopes of another attempt at cardioversion; however,
he spontaneously reverted to a sinus rhythm.  Unfortunately,
as the dobutamine was restarted, the patient again went into
atrial fibrillation, but again, spontaneously converted after
less than 48 hours.

By previous cardiac catheterization it was known that the
patient had only 30% stenosis in his LAD.  Cardiology was
consulted and felt that the catheterization was not warranted
in this patient.  His cardiac enzymes, CK peaked at a level
of 422; with an peak index of 13.0.  Troponin peaked at 37.

#2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially treated for a
possibility pneumonia with Vancomycin.  However, it was
quickly felt that the patient did not have an infectious
pneumonia.  The patient did, however, go into worsening
pulmonary edema, and he was initially intubated for hypoxic
failure.  The patient was extubated on hospital day #3, and
did fairly well with a blow-by face mask.  On physical
examination he was found to have bilateral pleural effusions.
He also continued to have crackles at the bases.  However, he
could not tolerate diuresis given his tenuous blood pressure.

#3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was presumed to have a
hematocrit drop from a GI bleed, howev
