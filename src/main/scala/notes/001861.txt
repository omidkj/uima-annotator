Brief Hospital Course:
After the first angiogram, the patient became short of breath
and  complained of throat pain. He became progressively
hypotensive and PEA arrested. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was
initiated and a 9F 40cc IABP was promply placed in the right
common femoral artery. Following successful intubation, Cardiac
surgery was called and the patient was placed on ECMO with
optimal flow rates ([**3-19**] Lt/min) within 25
minutes of the initial event. Of note, the patient's  rhythm
degenerated into VF and he was shocked twice with 200 joules and
reverted to sinus rhythm. He was stabilized, sedated and
transferred to the cardiothoracic ICU for further management
including potential CABG depending on the patient's neurological
status. Over the next 24 hours, patients clinical status
steadily deteriorated. Patient was taken off ECMO, became
asystolic and expired with his family present.
