Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 14680**] service at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2195-10-18**] for evaluation of a known tracheoesophageal (TE)
fistula first diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**].  Two days later, she underwent
flexible and rigid bronchoscopic evaluation which elucidated a
3cm defect in the posterior membranous wall located 3cm above
the carina most likely compatible with a tracheoesophageal
fistula, and diffuse moderate tracheal bronchomalacia.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought back to the
SICU following the procedure.  For more details of the
procedure, see operative dictation.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] remained on ventilatory support and was doing well.
An endocrinology consult was obtained after an elevated TSH was
found in the setting of hypothyroidism s/p partial thyroidectomy
and radiation for thyroid carcinoma in [**2146**].  Endocrinology felt
that the fluctuating TSH was likely due to absorption of her
levothyroxine concomitant with her tube feeding schedule.  The
team recommended continuing her regular levothyroxine dosage
through her J-tube and holding her tube feeds 1 hour before and
after administering her levothyroxine, witholding other
medication administration at the same time as the levothyroxine
is dosed and to recheck a TSH and free T4 in 4 weeks.  No
follow-up with Endocrinology is necessary.

On [**2195-10-26**], the patient was taken to the OR for flexible
bronchoscopy, fiberoptic intubation, tracheal Y-stent placement
and tracheostomy tube change for management of her TE fistula.
The stent was successfully placed over the fistula and the
patient tolerated this procedure well and was taken back to the
SICU following the procedure.  For details of the procedure, see
operative dictation.  An esophageal stent was attempted by GI,
but due to her esophageal edema, the procedure was aborted.  She
is to follow-up with GI in [**12-26**] weeks for another attempt.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was doing well and on [**2195-10-29**], she was deemed stable
enough to return home in the care of her daughter, an [**Name (NI) **]
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is to take a 10 day course of linezolid for MRSA
in her sputum ([**2195-10-19**]) and VRE+ surveillance swab.  She is to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-26**] weeks and GI at the same time.
