Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness, difficulty speaking.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography and administration of intracerebral intraarterial
tPA.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 61 year old right-handed male with no significant
past medical history or known vascular risk factors who
presented on [**2116-9-7**] as transfer from outside hospital with
acute onset left sided weakness and slurred speech.

Patient was in his usual state of health until sometime around 2
pm on day of admission. He was last seen well by his wife
~1:30pm, when he dropped off something at her office. He reports
that around 2pm, he arose from chair and fell onto his left
side, landing on his shoulder. Prior to that, he reports a dull
right frontal and orbital headache. Denies visual changes, head
injury, loss of consciousness, paresthesias, chest pain,
palpitations, vertigo,
lightheadedness, shortness of breath. His wife returned home
from work at 4pm and found him slumped on the floor and noted
his speech disturbed. She notified emergency medical services
and he was transported to [**Hospital3 7362**]. On transport to [**Hospital1 3597**],
he was noted to have blood glucose of 61 and given ampule of
dextrose.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 3597**], vitals showed BP 133/68, HR 57, RR 16, T
97.7. He was noted to complain of headache. Noted to have right
gaze preference, left upper and lower extremity weakness, and
left sided neglect. CT scan there read as right MCA "dense"
sign. He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], NIH stroke scale was 19. He was immediately
taken to the angiography suite and underwent administration of
20 mg intra- arterial tPA for right M1 MCA proximal occlusion.
Post-tPA NIH stroke scale of 17. Post-tPA, he complained of
worsened headache. He was taken to CT scan where a small area of
right basal ganglia hemorrhage was noted. After arrival to the
ICU, he was able to move left lower extremity against gravity.

CT head [**9-7**] post tPA: Motion limited study. Right basal ganglia
hyperdensity consistent with acute hemorrhage without
significant associated mass effect.

MRI [**9-8**]: There is abnormal signal in the right basal ganglia
consistent with the CT findings of acute basal ganglionic
hemorrhage. There is abnormal signal in the posterior frontal
lobe involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter on diffusion and T2W sequences
consistent with subacute infarction. There is no evidence of a
focal extra-axial lesion or fluid collections. There is some
deformity of the right lateral ventricle.

MRA [**9-8**]: There is no evidence of aneurysm or definite flow
abnormality. Perhaps slight irregularity of the inferior
division of the right middle cerebral artery but this is
indefinite.

Surface echocardiogram [**9-8**]:
1. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
2D, color  Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Transesophageal echocardiogram [**9-9**]: No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. LAA ejection velocity was good (> 40 cm/s). No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Carotid dopplers: Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the
level of the cervical portions of the bilateral carotid and
vertebral arteries.No plaque was found on either side. The
waveforms and velocities in the bilateral internal, common and
external carotid arteries and in the bilateral vertebral
arteries were normal, with antegrade flow.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 61 year old right-handed male with no significant
past medical history who presented on [**2116-9-7**] with acute onset
slurred speech, left sided weakness. Neurological exam on
presentation was remarkable for a left field cut, left facial,
left hemiparesis, left neglect and dysarthria. This was
consistent with a right MCA infarct. CT scan at [**Hospital3 **]
showed a dense right MCA. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was taken
immediately to angiography. Angiography confirmed a right MCA
infarct
with occlusion at the proximal M1 segment, likely secondary
either to artery-artery or cardiogenic embolus. Patient was
treated with 20 mg of intra-arterial tPA. Status post
intra-arterial tPA he had improvement in left lower extremity
movement and was able to hold his leg against gravity. NIH
stroke scale improved from 19 to 9. However, post-tPA he
complained of worsened headache; CT scan demonstrated right
basal ganglia hemorrhage.

He was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit overnight. Repeat
