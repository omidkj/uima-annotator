Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
recurrent V-tach

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation including cold tip
cardiac catherization
Pericardial window with placement of intrapericardial catheter
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
75 yo man with h/o 2V CAD (occluded RCA and LCx), CHF (EF 20%)
and an ICD placed in [**2157**] for inducible VT, HTn, high
cholesterol, COPD who presented with recurrent V-tach.  Pt was
admitted to [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital on [**2164-9-10**] for an episiode of ICD
firing and subsequently transfered to CMC on [**2164-9-12**] where his
ICD was upgraded to a biventricular device and PT underwent a VT
ablation.  Unfortunately VT ablation was unsuccesful.
Furthermore Pt's LV required revision on [**2164-9-17**] secondary to
central line placement.  Pt continued to have runs of slow
V-tach and multiple ICD firings after unsuccessful ATP.  Pt
experienced all of this even while on lidocaine, amiodarone and
quinidine.  Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU after failed VT ablation
for closer monitoring.  Upon presentation Pt with some shortness
of breath contributable to mild CHF, otherwise hemodynamically
stable.

[**9-22**] SUPINE AP PORTABLE CHEST: The tip of the right internal
jugular line ends just below the level of the right clavicular
head. A 3-lead pacemaker is present. The heart is enlarged, and
the aorta is tortuous. There is increased pulmonary vascularity
with indistinctness of the vascular margins and peribronchial
cuffing, compatible with congestive heart failure. No pleural
effusion is detected. The lateral portions of the right lung,
including the right lateral costophrenic angle, are excluded
from examination.

IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure.

[**9-24**] Echo Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is no pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
circulation with two vessel coronary artery disease.  LMCA had
no
angiographically apparent CAD.  LAD had mild diffuse
irregularites. LCX
was totally occluded after small OM1. Large OM2 filled via left
to left
collaterals. RCA was known to be occluded and therefore not
selectly
engaged. Distal RCA filled via left to right collateralls.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed normal blood pressure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe two vessel coronary artery disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo male w/ 2VD (occluded RCA, LCx), severely depressed EF,
s/p ICD placement for VT in 98' admitted to an OSH for frequent
ICD firing for VT and transferred after failed VT ablation.

1) V-Tach:  Pt with a complicated history with an ICD placed in
[**2157**] for inducible V-tach who originally presented to OSH for
ICD firing; course there significant for upgrading his ICD to a
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular device, an unsuccessful VT ablation and courses
of lidoncaine, amiodarone and quinidine.  Pt transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further EP evaluation.  Initial study significant for
probable scar in posterobaslal region of LV, initiation of VT
after spontaneous VPDs and after failed attempt of pace
termination the VT degenerated into VF requiring DCCV, lastly an
ablation was undertook through the posterobasal scar.  Pt with
continued runs of V-tach after ablation.  Pt maintained on
lidocaine drip for antiarrthymic therapy.  Pt continued to
suffer from persistent runs of VT (many of the slow variety) of
different morphology with ATP mostly ineffective; a few of which
resulting in ICD firing.  Mexelitine increased and lidocaine
weaned to off and plan for epicardial ablation.  Unfortunately,
Pt with increased slow VT and a episode of sustained monomorphic
VT with ICD firing requiring lidocaine gtt to be restarted and
mexilitine held. Pt underwent epicardial ablation without
difficulty, yet once again was unsuccessful as Pt continued to
suffer from episodes of ventricular ectopy most likely secondary
to an intramural VT.  Pacer parameters were changed to DDI 90
with AV delay of 250 with hopes that the increased rate would
suppress VT.  Lidocaine was continued and mexilitine held.  Yet
again Pt with continued episodes of VTach.  Hospital course then
