Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
numbness and weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- cervical laminectomy and fusion, C3-C7
- insertion of IVC filter
- colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old Jehovah's Witness with history of
cervical spinal stenosis who presents after falling the morning
of admission, after which he felt numbness of his chest from the
nipples down and weakness of all four extremities. He decribes
the fall as a loss of balance. He describes hitting his head
with no more than a second of loss of consciousnesss and
difficulty speaking. He called for help and was taken to
[**Hospital 26380**] Hospital where he was given decadron. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], at which point he began to have some
resolution of the numbnesss in his chest, and left leg, but was
left with weakness of the right and left hands, and numbness and
weakness of the right leg.
.
On the floor, he reported spasms of pain moving up and down his
whole spine. He denies fevers, chills, bowel or bladder
incontinence, or a history of IV drug use. He denies IV drug
use. He has had decreased perianal and penile sensation over the
last year, as well as chronic constipation. He reports many
falls and poor balance over the last several years, described as
loss of balance and falling to the right because of inability to
lift his right leg while walking.  He has had three years of
progressive right lower extremity numbness and 6-9 months of
right lower extremity weakness making getting in and out of cars
difficult, but he was still able to climb stairs and drive. In
addition, he has had numbness and weakness of the last two
fingers of the right hand and recently has progressed to left
lower extremity numbness.

Past Medical History:
- Polio, as child
- Spinal stenosis, sees a chiropractor


Social History:
The patient lives with his wife and is a former smoker. He quit
drinking 3 months prior to admission, but had consumed [**1-6**]

abuse and is sexually active only with his wife.

STUDIES
.
[**8-19**] T/L spine MRI
No post-traumatic abnormality seen in the thoracic or lumbar
spine.
Moderate-to-severe canal stenosis from L2 through L5,
multifactorial related to DJD and epidural lipomatosis.
.
[**8-20**] C spine MRI
On the sagittal images, there is no malalignment or loss of
vertebral body height.
No suspect marrow lesions are seen.
There is moderately severe spinal stenosis and cord compression
extending from approximately C4 down to C6 with abnormal cord
signal at C6 likely representing myelomalacia from cord
compression. There are large disc osteophyte complexes from C4
through C6, also with probable ossification of the posterior
longitudinal ligament.
There is no evidence for ligamentous injury on the STIR images.
Axial images at C2-C3 demonstrate mild disc bulge without
significant central or foraminal stenosis.
At C3-C4, there is a disc osteophyte complex with mild bilateral
foraminal narrowing. There is mild central stenosis.
At C4-C5, there is a large disc osteophyte complex causing
moderate cord compression and canal stenosis. There is mild
bilateral foraminal narrowing from uncovertebral hypertrophy.
At C5-C6, there is a large disc osteophyte complex causing
severe cord compression and canal stenosis. There is also
moderately severe bilateral foraminal narrowing from
uncovertebral hypertrophy.
At C6-C7, there is a disc osteophyte complex with a central disc
protrusion. There is moderate central stenosis. There is severe
right and moderate left foraminal narrowing from uncovertebral
hypertrophy. Abnormal cord signal is also noted at this level
reflecting myelomalacia from cord compression.
At C7-T1, no significant abnormality is seen except for mild
bilateral foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION:
Significant cervical degenerative disease with moderately severe
canal stenosis and cord compression with abnormal cord signal
from C4-C5 through C6- C7.
.
[**8-31**] LENIS
IMPRESSION: Left common femoral vein to proximal superficial
femoral vein occlusive thrombus.
.
[**8-31**] CTA chest
FINDINGS: There are extensive filling defects within bilateral
pulmonary arteries and extending into all branches. The aorta
maintains a normal contour without evidence of dissection. The
heart and pericardium are normal. The lungs demonstrate
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
effusions. A wedge shaped opacity is seen in the peripheral
right lung base, which may be related to infarction given large
pulmonay emboli. No hilar, axillary or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is
detected. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic
spine with DISH.
IMPRESSION: Extensive filling defects within bilateral bilateral
pulmonary arteries extening into all segments of the lungs,
consistent with pulmonary embolus. Wedge shaped opacity in the
right lower lobe, which may be related to pulmonary infarction.
.
[**9-2**] IVC filter placement
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of the G2 IVC filter within the
infrarenal IVC.
.
[**9-2**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symm
