Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
vomiting, hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
fluoro-guided PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo G6P2 woman, with recent history of endometrial cancer
diagnosed on exploratory laparotomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy on [**5-13**] and discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] on
[**5-23**], presents with vomiting undigested food, hematemesis vs
hemoptysis, and confusion. The patient had been doing well at
rehab until yesterday per notes and her report. She tells me
that she vomited yesterday; per records sent with her, it
appears as though the patient vomited undigested food and then
had episodes of "spitting up blood-tinged sputum." She had one
episode of coughing up bright red blood. Per report, her initial
blood pressure was in the 60s systolic. The patient's mental
status had been improving since her discharge, but today she was
noted to be more confused and less oriented.
.
In the ER, the patient had abdominal imaging which showed ileus
without obstruction. She was evaluated by both the General
Surgery and the Gyn-Onc teams. She had an NG lavage with small
amounts of pink fluid which cleared; she was guaiac positive on
rectal exam per ER exam but remained hemodynamically stable
throughout her ED course. She was transfused with 2 U PRBCs as
well as 2 U FFP for INR 3.4. Repeat Hgb at 0100 was 32.6 from
25.8. She also received 1 L NS. Head CT was without bleed or
mass effect. She was also evaluated by the GI team.
.
In the ED, she was also found to have a right middle lobe
pneumonia in conjunction with WBC count of 13.8 (92%
neutrophils). She was treated with one dose of levofloxacin.
Blood cultures were sent and are pending.
.
At the present time, the patient denies abdominal pain. She
cannot remember exactly why she was brought to the hospital; she
does remember that she vomited "yesterday" and that she has been
feeling poorly since that time though she cannot elaborate. She
denies cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, and shortness of
breath. She cannot tell me whether or not she has been having
bowel movements or whether her abdomen is distended.


Past Medical History:
PMHx:
* Endometrial carcinoma with torsion - s/p exploratory
lapartomy, bilateral salpino-oophorectomy, and bowel
disimpaction on [**5-13**] complicated by postoperative delirium
* Partial SBO (admission [**5-7**]) thought due to mechanical
obstruction from ovarian mass (now s/p removal)
* Catheter-associated DVT (R IJ)
* Coronary artery disease, status post MI in [**2070**].
* Hypertension.
* Breast cancer [**2061**], status post right radical mastectomy.
* Iron deficiency anemia, baseline HCT 36-39
* Diverticulosis.
* Carpal tunnel syndrome.
* Osteoarthritis.
* Chronic Renal Insufficiency (baseline 1.5-1.7 --> GFR
30cc/min)
.
PSH:
1. Appendectomy
2. Right radical mastectomy
3. Cone biopsy
4. [**2107-5-13**] ex lap/BSO/bowel disimpaction for endometrial Ca

Social History:
She is widowed and previously lived alone. Prior to recent
admission was able to take care of self overall: was ambulating,
toileting, dress. No history of alcohol use. She has smoked two
packs per week for over sixty years. >120 pkyr hx. Has several
children, all except one lives in state. Recently was discharged
to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**5-23**].

Family History:
Mother lived to age [**Age over 90 **]. Otherwise unknown.

Physical Exam:
PE: T 99.6 BP 146/78 HR 98 RR 14 O2Sat 100% RA
Gen: Patient awake and cooperative
Heent: OP clear, MMM
Neck: no palpable lymphadenopathy
Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 grade III/VI SEM heard throughout precordium

Lungs: slight crackles in right midlung/base, otherwise clear to
auscultation
Abd: surgical scar at midline below umbilicus well-healed,
distended abdomen but soft and nontender to palpation.
Normoactive bowel sounds.
Ext: Right UE larger in size than left UE. Anasarcatous.
Neuro: Awake, pleasant. Oriented to self, year, location
(building). Not oriented to month, name of hospital.


Pertinent Results:
[**2107-6-2**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1. Findings consistent with ileus. No
evidence of small bowel obstruction.
2. Ascites, small pleural effusions, and anasarca. These
findings are likely related to the patient's recent operation,
and volume-related hemodilution could contribute to the
apparently "decreased hematocrit."
.
[**2107-6-2**] CT HEAD: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
.
[**2107-6-2**] CXR: Right middle lobe pneumonia. Small bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
[**2107-6-2**] KUB: Prominent loops of small bowel may be related to
ileus, early or partial small bowel obstruction cannot be
excluded.
.
[**2107-6-2**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Borderline low limb lead voltage.
Leftward axis. Lead V2 is technically difficult. Since the
previous tracing of [**2107-5-13**] the Q-T interval is shorter.
.
[**2107-6-3**] CXR: 1. Re-identification of patchy right middle lobe
pneumonia.
2. Increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Resolving small bilateral pleural effusions with probable
mild interstitial remaining edema.
.
[**2107-6-4**] CT CHEST: 1. Left upper lobe cavitary lesion concerning
for primary lung cancer or metastatic disease. An infectious
process is less likely.
2. Redemonstration of right middle and upper lobe pneumonia.
3. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
.
[**2107-6-7**] CXR: There is now a small right pleural effusion. The
patient's CHF has essentially cleared. There is some patchy
linear atelectasis at the right base.
