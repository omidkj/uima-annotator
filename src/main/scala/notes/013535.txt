fever and cough. She states that she recently went on a trip to

speech therapist at the time commented that she should try avoid
using her voice and only write. She states that she had no pain
with speaking but did have nasal congestion and felt as if she
had "terrible laryngitis". She returned from [**Country 6171**] after an 8
hour plane ride and felt as if her nasal congestion worsened
afterwards. She also began having a cough productive of yellow
green sputum since two days prior to admission. She reports
occasional blood tinged sputum, which occurs when she has
epistaxis. She has [**Country **] dyspnea on exertion, which she feels
has been getting slightly worse with the progression of her
other symptoms. She also started to have low grade fevers last
night which worsened this AM to 102.3. Her PCP encouraged her to
present to the ED.
.
In the ED, a CXR was negative for cardiopulmonary disease and a
CTA was negative for PE. She was initially admitted to medicine,
but while waiting for a bed had a BP of 75/37 which improved to
SBP of 95-100 after 3-4 liters of saline. She was also given
Vancomycin 1 gram IV for hypotension and h/o MRSA.
.

several days, intermittent, no associated diaphoresis/N/V, not
specifically related to exertion.
