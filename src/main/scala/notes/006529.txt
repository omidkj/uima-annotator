Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, abdominal distention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
paracentesis x 2

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 43 y.o male with h.o anoxic brain injury (non-verbal)
s/p cardiac arrest [**9-10**] (EF 20%), chronic trach (requires
frequent suctioning), who was found to have abdominal
distention, fluid retention and pitting edema in his upper and
lower extremities, fever, ARF, abnormal LFTs at [**Hospital 671**] rehab. He
is on Vanco ([**1-1**]), levaquin (+ucx [**1-1**]). He was noted to have a
leukocytosis. [**12-6**] bcx bottles growing staph aureus.
.
Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 96035**] with concerns of bleeding from
a trach, formerly admitted for tongue laceration ([**Date range (1) 58377**]).
During that course pt had all of his teeth removed and was
clonazepam. He was noted to have a high grade MRSA bacteremia
and started on 4 wk course of Vanco (last day [**12-19**]). Pt also has
ground glass opacities on the CT scan that were thought to
represent aspiration of blood, bronch negative for hemorrhage.
TEE negative. He also completed a 7 day course of Cefepime and
Cipro for VAP. LUE US showed developed thrombus and pt was
discharged on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] (day 1 [**11-30**])-however given repeat u/s
showing no clot-lovenox was dc'd.
.
In the ED, initial VS:
14:44 0 97 97 124/76 16 100
o2 100% on 6L, HR 99, BP 101/69, RR 18, no temp.
Chest x-ray, CT performed (showing large amount of ascites),
flagyl given. Para performed. Tube feeds found to have large
residuals in the ED.
.
Unable to assess ROS.


Past Medical History:
Diabetes
Dyslipidemia
Hypertension
Systolic CHF: EF 20%
S/p STEMI [**6-/2193**], w/ large thrombus in the proximal LAD
complicated by cardiogenic shock w/ DES to prox LAD
[**11/2193**]: [**Month/Year (2) 3941**] placement for Low EF, runs of NSVT.
H/o alcohol and substance abuse
H/o deep vein thrombosis partially treated with Coumadin
Positive hepatitis B serologies in the past
S/p PEA arrest in [**9-/2202**] with resulting anoxic brain injury
during VT ablation in EP lab. At baseline, the pt is responsive

only to deep painful stim (such as deep suctioning), although he
does appear alert and open his eyes (no tracking). He is
completely dependent for all ADLs.

Social History:
He had been on disability for 10 years since his first heart
attack. Prior to that he was a manager at [**Company **]'s. He
reported smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes per week.
He also reported history of ETOH but denied any IVDA. Now
unresponsive to all but deep painful stim, and completely
dependent for all ADLs. Baseline GCS of 9.


Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Vitals - T. 97.8, HR 104, BP 107/66, RR 20, sat 96% on 6L
GENERAL: trached, lying in bed, tongue writing
HEENT:nc/at, would not keep eyes open for exam, no icterus.
CARDIAC: s1s2 RRR 3/6 LLSB systolic murmur, no r/g
LUNG: b/l AE +transmitted upper airway noses, lower rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: +bs, distended with ascites, NT (no grimace), no
guarding.
EXT: moves R.arm and legs slightly. no c/c/e 2+pulses
NEURO:AAOx0, unable to assess cranial nerves. no tremor, does
not follow any commands. Eyes occasionally open and look around.

DERM: no apparent rashes


Pertinent Results:
CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tense ascites significantly larger than the prior study. No
other acute
intra-abdominal processes identified. However the study is
limited due to
non-contrast setting and streak artifacts from folded arms.
2. A small pericardial effusion, larger than the prior study.
3. LLL opacity configuration favors atelectasis, can not exclude
infection.

US:
1. Normal flow and waveforms within the hepatic vasculature.
2. Gallbladder wall thickening and sludge within the
gallbladder.
Gallbladder wall thickening is likely due to third spacing in
the setting of hepatitis.
3. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. CBD measures 5 mm.
4. Abdominal ascites.


ECHO: unchanged from prior EF 20%, TEE without vegetations or
appararent infection of pacer/[**Company 3941**] wires

US of [**Company 3941**] pocket negative for fluid collection

ASCITES:
cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
