History of Present Illness:
82F with recently diagnosed MDS, presenting with fever, malaise,
and pain over L SCM and right lateral neck.

Recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 56873**] with fevers (after
OSH admission starting [**2124-9-1**]); found to have MDS (RAEB-2) by
bone marrow biopsy (at OSH, and then again at [**Hospital1 18**]).
Significant hypoxemia at time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], initially in
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Abnormal chest CT, had intubated bronch, micro
unremarkable but significant blood seen.  Had L IJ placement at
OSH, removed on [**2124-9-13**] at [**Hospital1 18**].  Of note her bone marrow
biopsy also showed granulomatous inflammation; Quantiferon was
indeterminate, urine histo antigen was weakly positive.
Received steroids briefly at OSH; here vanco/cefepime then
zosyn/azithro/ambisome then vori; discharged on vori plus few
more days levofloxacin.  Has had ID and hemeonc followup as an
outpatient.
.
At home fevers the day before admission, also noted L SCM area
neck pain around that time.  The right lateral neck pain has
been going on [**1-6**] days.  No sweats or rigors (though having
here).  No pains elsewhere.  No dyspnea, chest pain, cough,
hemoptysis, sputum, abdominal pain, weight changes, edema, rash.
 Overall reports eating and ambulating normally until yesterday.
.
In the ED fever as high 101.7.  Exam of neck concerning for
abscess.  WBCs 1.7 with 37N and 21B.  Remainder of CBC at
baseline.  CT neck done - small anterior abscess (9mm), likely
at prior CVL site.  Lung apices also with bilateral infiltrate.
I&D done and culture sent.  Given vanco/cefepime.  Feels
significantly improved since incision done.
.
On the morning of the transfer to ICU, she was noted to be
mildly wheezy on morning rounds and afebrile.  The patient
states she got up to go to the bathroom, she reports she was
straining, and became acutely tachypneic, tachycardic to the
130s, and reportedly hypoxic to 66% on RA with sats
progressively reaching 100%.  The patient was immediately
evaluated by the BMT attending and fellow, who felt she was
"very wheezy," she was given nebulizers.  She was noted to be
febrile to 101.3.  By the time of ICU transfer heart rate had
decreased to the low 100's.  Oxygen saturation was 100% on NRB
and she was not tachypneic.  Her JVP at 90 degrees was noted to
be at the angle of the mandible. She was never hypotensive.  On
arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient continued to look well, and was
rapidly transitioned to nasal canula, and room air on which she
was noted to be 100% and non-tachypneic.
.
Her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay was largely uncomplicated.  She experienced
tachypnea with moderate hypertension and tachycardia but was
never hypoxic and never required more than supplemental oxygen.
These episodes occured when she had fevers and resolved with
Tylenol, Motrin, Ativan 0.5, and coaching to take deep breaths.
She was given intravenous lasix (20mg on more than one occasion)
since she was 1.6 liters positive on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]; on
transfer out she was net negative.  She was transferred to the
floor on [**10-18**] and at that time stated that she feels well
without any difficulty breathing.
