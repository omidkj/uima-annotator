Reason: f/o pneumomediastinum

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
31 year old man with s/p avr mvr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
f/o pneumomediastinum
PROCEDURE: Chest PA and lateral on [**2188-2-12**].

COMPARISON: [**2188-2-10**].

HISTORY: Followup pneumomediastinum.

FINDINGS: The air-fluid level seen in the right upper quadrant
has decreased on today's examination. There is persistent
pneumoperitoneum persistent in both right and left upper
quadrants of the abdomen. Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular
engorgement has improved, although the heart remains enlarged.
There is small bilateral right more than left pleural effusion.
Pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum are no longer visualized
on today's examination. The moderately severe bibasilar
atelectasis are unchanged. No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum are no longer
visualized.
2. Persistent pneumoperitoneum with a decrease in the air-fluid
level seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen underneath
the right hemidiaphragm.
3. Small bilateral right more than left pleural effusion.
4. Small pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement.
5. Persistent severe bibasilar atelectasis.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2188-2-7**]  7:00:04 PM


Sinus rhythm. Borderline left ventricular hypertrophy. Prolonged

Q-T interval. Intraventricular conduction delay. Compared to the
previous
tracing diffuse ST-T wave changes are slightly more prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Once admitted to the medical floor he underwent an
echocardiogram which showed mitral and aortic valve vegetations,
suggestive of endocarditis. He was started Vancomycin with plan
for TEE and cardiac surgery evaluation. found to have MSSE
bacteremia (cxs on [**1-24**]), believed source is HD cath. TEE which
again showed MV involvement w/ severe MR, and AV involvement w/
severe AI. HD line was resited. He also underwent a CT scan of
abdomen, which showed splenic infarction vs. septic emboli, also
pulmonary nodules suggesting possible septic emboli. He became
hypoxic as well as had episode of hemoptysis and tachycardia and
was transferred to the MICU. EKG showed sinus tach with inverted
t waves in lateral leads.
CXR at the time demonstrated primarily R sided consolidation vs
volume overload.  Emergent repeat TTE at time of event showed no
change in MR. The likely explanation for the hemmoptysis was
felt to be acute pulmonary HTN combined with pulmonary edema and
bacteremia leading alveolar hemorrhage. Pt was stabilized on NRB
face mask, nitorprusside drip, hydralazine, and metoprolol
following transfer to the MICU. Pt had no subsequent respiratory
distress and was transferred to the medical floor while awaiting
MVR/AVR, hydralazine and metoprolol were continued on the
medical floor. Pt received HD while in-house with continued EPO
as dosed by the HD protocol for chronic anemia in the setting of
ESRD/HIV. Pt's HD frequency was adjusted/increased given acute
volume overload in the setting of valvular insufficiency-related
heart failure.  He continued on methadone.
He continued with preoperative workup including dental
clearance, CT head and TEE. He was electively intubated and then
extubated after TEE. His blood cultures remained negative and he
was taken to the operating room on [**2-7**] where he underwent an
AVR/MVR. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition. He was extubated the morning of POD #1. He was
transferred to the floor later on POD #1. He did well
postoperatively. His AV fistula failed, and he was taken for a
fistulogram which showed Severe stenosis of the draining vein of
the b
