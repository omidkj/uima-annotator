Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Liver failure due to acetaminophen
overdose.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 19-year-old
male with history of polysubstance abuse/dependence, who
presented to outside hospital with nausea and vomiting
secondary to intentional Tylenol and Motrin overdose.
Patient is being transferred back to General Medicine floor
after a second short MICU stay.

On [**2172-3-19**], the patient was in a motor vehicle accident,
which totalled uncle's girlfriend's car.  Uncle is quite
upset and chastised him.  In addition to this, the patient
had been feeling more depressed over the past few weeks due
to legal problems.  On [**2172-3-20**], the patient impulsively took
50-100 tablets of Tylenol as well as Motrin.

From [**3-20**] until [**3-23**], the patient felt sick and went to
outside hospital Emergency Department 2-3x before admitting
to his acetaminophen overdose when a tox screen returned
positive for Tylenol.  Tylenol level on admission to outside
hospital Emergency Department was 44.75 with ALT of 14,064,
AST of 7,042.  The patient was also found to have acute renal
failure, possibly due to Motrin overdose.  That same day, the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] MICU, and given Mucomyst x15
doses.

While in the MICU, the patient was evaluated by Transplant,
Liver Service, Toxicology, and Psychiatry.  According
psychiatric consult, the patient now regrets the OD and does
not want to die.  Seemed relieved when told there was a
chance of survival.  In the MICU, his LFTs trended down, no
acidosis or encephalopathy, lactate 3.2, creatinine 2.3, INR
of 5.7.  Thus, the patient is determined not to be a
candidate for an urgent transplant, and on [**2172-3-25**], he was
transferred to General Medicine floor.

The patient's liver enzymes continued to trend downward and
ARF improved with hydration.  The patient was then
transferred back to the MICU overnight for closer
observation.  Overnight, his condition continued to improve.
Today he developed cellulitis in the left hand from IV and
was started on Keflex 500 mg IV q8h.  The patient was seen by
Liver Service, which recommended switching to oral Mucomyst.
This evening he was transferred back to the General Medicine
floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mild asthma.  The patient is on no
medications for this.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 19-year-old man with a history of
polysubstance abuse/dependence, who presented to outside
hospital with nausea and vomiting secondary to intentional
acetaminophen and Motrin overdose.  The patient is
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with
liver failure and acute renal failure.

1. Gastrointestinal:  On admission to outside hospital,
acetaminophen level of 44.75 with ALT of 14,064 and AST of
7,042.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital3 **] MICU on [**2172-3-24**]
with liver failure and INR of 5.7.  The patient was placed on
IV Mucomyst and IVF.  The patient responded well to IV
Mucomyst with LFTs trending down and was subsequently
transferred to the medicine floor on [**2172-3-25**].

Liver consult felt that patient was not an urgent candidate
for transplant and Toxicology recommended use of Mucomyst
until the patient's INR was less than 2.  On the floor, the
patient's LFTs continued to trend down but the patient
determined to need closer monitoring, and was transferred
back to the MICU that same day.  The patient was transferred
back to the Medicine floor on [**2172-3-26**], and placed on po
Mucomyst, bowel regimen, and continued IVF.

From [**Date range (1) **], the patient's LFTs continued trending down,
and on [**3-29**], the patient's INR was less than 2.0.  The
patient's T bilirubin fluctuated from 12 to 14 during this
time, and he experienced occasional bouts of nausea mostly
related to Mucomyst ingestion.  In addition to this, the
patient had no abdominal pains and all stools were guaiac
negative.  Mucomyst was discontinued on [**3-29**].  On [**3-30**], the
patient was discharged to home with followup with PCP.

2. Renal:  Patient transferred to [**Hospital3 **] MICU on
[**2172-3-24**] with acute renal failure and creatinine of 2.3.
Acute renal failure likely secondary to nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories overdose.  The patient was treated
supportive with IVF from [**3-24**] to [**3-28**].  IVF was
discontinued on [**3-28**].  During this time, the patient's renal
function gradually improved from a creatinine of 2.3 to 1.6,
and continued to remain around 1.6 on discharge.  Patient
will have follow up with primary care physician regarding
renal function.

3. (ID):  During second MICU stay, the patient developed left
hand cellulitis, possibly from his IV.  The patient was
placed on renally dosed cephalexin 500 mg po q6h on [**2172-3-26**]
x7 days.  From [**Date range (1) 47979**] resolved without complications.
On [**3-30**], only slight swelling visible in left hand.  The
patient will continue with antibiotics for three more days
outpatient.

4. (Psych):  Patient is seen by Psychiatry on admission and
setup with one-to-one sitter.  Psychiatry determined that the
patient regretted the overdose and did not want to die.  The
patient was relieved when told of chance of survival.  Sitter
was discontinued on [**3-28**] per second recommendatio
