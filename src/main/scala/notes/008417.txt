Brief Hospital Course:
52yo M brought to [**Hospital1 18**] by ambulance as a trauma basic.
Evaluation in trauma bay demonstrated persistent hypotension
which mildly improved with IVF resuscitation and 3u PRBC
transfusion, despite a negative FAST examination.  A DPL was
attempted and was not confirmatory for the absence of
hemoperitoneum.  Accordingly, he was brought to the operating
room for exploratory laparotomy which did not reveal an
intraabdominal injury, as well as washout/debridement of his BL
UE injuries by orthopedics; please see each operative report for
further details.  Post-operatively he was brought to the TSICU,
intubated and sedated, and hemodynamically stable.  The
remainder of his hospital course will be summarized by system:
.
Neuro: Sedation and analgesia provided by drips during
intubation, weaned after tracheotomy.  Currently off drips and
managed with intermittent ativan and oxycodone.
.
CV: Pressors were weaned off quickly after initial operation. He
was hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay.  On lopressor, norvasc, and imdur for HTN, with
intermittent hydralazine.
.
Resp:  The vent settings were progressively weaned, slowed by
volume overload from his perioperative resuscitation which was
limited due to his acute-on-chronic renal failure.  He was
extubated on HD 10 but required reintubation that same day.  He
was trach'd on HD 13 because of failure to wean/extubate.  Vent
was progressively weaned, currently on CPAP/PS 35%, PS between 5
and 10, and PEEP 5.  He tolerates trach collar intermittently.
He did have an enterobacter PNA on HD 15, resistant to
Zosyn/cephalosporins, which was treated with a 7-day course of
Cipro IV and Tobramycin inhaled.
.
GI:  No intraabdominal injuries identified at laparotomy.  The
port for the gastric band was exposed by the abdominal
laceration and removed on HD 2 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The remainder of
the gastric band was removed at the time of surgical g-tube
placement on HD 13.  Tube feeds were begun the following day.
Has been on a bowel regimen with regular stools.
.
GU/Renal:  Pt has chronic renal insufficiency, which flared to
acute renal failure after attempted diuresis.  Initially
creatinine 2.1, peaked at 5.1, and settled at 2.7.  Renal
consulted; presumably ATN.  Vascular surgery consulted for
possible renal artery stenosis -- considered angiogram with
carbon dioxide contrast but deferred as renal function began to
improve.  Hypernatremia of 155 treated with extensive FW
administration, resistant to improvement by both G-tube and IV,
now resolved and beginning to reduce the FW administration.  One
additional attempt at diuresis on HD 25 caused sl increase in
creatinine and further attempts have been put on hold.
.
Heme:  Pt was transfused in the trauma bay and OR.  He remained
anemic with Hct in the low 20's over the next few days despite
continued transfusions, presumably from chronic renal failure.
Because he was hemodynamically stable, further transfusions were
not given.  Ultimately he received 19 units of PRBC, 4u of Plts,
and 7u of FFP over the course of his hospitalization.
.
ID:  Cellulitis of RUE surgical site treated with Kefzol for ~1
week.  Enterobacter PNA on HD 15, resistant to
Zosyn/cephalosporins, which was treated with a 7-day course of
Cipro IV and Tobramycin inhaled.
.
Endo:  Glycemic control managed by [**Last Name (un) **] consult, initially for
hyperglycemia and lately for hypoglycemia.  Insulin gtt
initially required, now controlled with SQ by sliding scale and
long-term doses.
.
MSK:  BL open Monteggia fractures washed out on HD 1, R fixed
with ORIF on HD 2, L fixed with ORIF on HD 3.  Cellulitis of R
treated with Kefzol.  R groin laceration washed out on HD 1 by
GenSurg, WTD dsg applied, and re-washed out on HD 2 with
placement of VAC.  Currently receiving WTD to R groin.  R knee
degloving injury was washed out by ortho on HD 1, wrapped, and
stitched eventually removed.  Currently scabbed.  C-spine and
TLS-spine were cleared radiographically.  Nasal laceration at L
alar was repaired by plastics, with sutures removed prior to
discharge.
.
Proph: Hep SQ TID. GI prophylaxis ceased upon tolerance of TF.
