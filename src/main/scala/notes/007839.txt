Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 F with a dyemyelinating NM syndrome, restrictive lung
disease and Asthma who is at risk for aspiration presenting with
respiratory distress.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:
# Hypercapnic/hypoxic respiratory distress: This was thought
likely [**1-17**] to a copd flare/asthma exacerbation.  Aspiration was
also a possibility given her risk factors.  Treated with IV
solumedrol and transitioned to prednisone for flare of reactive
airway disease.  Kept on standing nebs.  O2 sats between 91-93%.
 ABG (7.26/53/78) c/w resp. acidosis likely chronic from
decreased ventilatory drive vs. chronic disease.  Discharged on
antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. ABX started later on during
course.
.
# Anxiety:  Continued outpatient medications
.
# Hypothyroidism:  Continued synthroid as per outpt regimen
.
# HL: Continued pravachol at outpt dose
