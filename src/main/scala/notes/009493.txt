Service:  CCU Medicine

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 76-year-old male
with increasing shortness of breath and PND for a week, who
was in outside hospital until a month ago, where he noted
increasing shortness of breath.  Patient also noted some
irregular heartbeat.  The patient reports increasing PND over
the past week, increasing shortness of breath and increasing
pedal edema without any chest pain.

Patient was seen by his PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was
admitted from home for Heparin, transesophageal
echocardiogram, and cardioversion on Monday.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. New onset afib.
2. Hypertension.
3. CAD status post CABG in '[**18**].
4. CRI.
5. CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%.
6. Gout.
7. AICD with [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing.
8. Hypercholesterolemia.
9. Status post left CEA, status post left renal stent.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Terazosin 4 a day.
2. Cozaar 50 a day.
3. Coreg 12.5 b.i.d.
4. Allopurinol 100 a day.
5. Aspirin 81 q.d.
6. Lasix 80 b.i.d.
7. Lipitor 40 q.d.
8. Isosorbide 60 a.m. and 30 p.m.
9. Senna 6 q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient 25 year two packs per day smoking
history, occasional alcohol, and no IV drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  110/80, 66, 20, and 95%
on room air.  General:  Obese male sitting in bed in no
apparent distress.  Neck:  12 cm JVD at 90 degrees.  Heart:
irregularly, irregular, no murmurs or gallops.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rales.  Abdomen:
Obese, positive bowel sounds, distended.  Extremities:  2+
pedal edema bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Echocardiogram on [**12-30**] showed left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, 2+ MR, which maybe
underestimated with a [**Hospital1 **]-V pacemaker.  EKG and chest x-ray
are pending.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  Coronary wise, the patient has coronary
artery disease status post CABG in '[**18**] with occluded SVG and
RCA.  Patient was continued on aspirin and Lipitor.  Patient
initially was hypotensive and his beta blocker was held until
his blood pressure continued to rise.  The patient was ruled
out for MI with three negative cardiac enzymes, and was on a
Heparin drip at that time.

2. Pump:  CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
15% with MR and left bundle branch block.  [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer with
ICD was placed.  For the decompensated CHF, the patient was
kept on dopamine and dobutamine, and all other blood pressure
medications were held, and patient was diuresed effectively
with the combination of dopamine and dobutamine, and Lasix.
Patient was fully weaned off the dopamine and dobutamine on
[**8-23**], which the patient was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].

Patient continued to diurese with decreasing O2 requirements.
However, patient was transferred back to the CCU on [**2127-8-31**]
at which point, patient creatinine had rise from 2.5 to 3.2,
and patient also had mental status changes with increasing
shortness of breath.  Patient was again started on a dopamine
and dobutamine combination with Lasix.  Patient then fell
into cardiogenic shock, and in addition, the patient went
into septic shock.

Additionally to this regimen, digoxin was added.  Patient,
however, was not able to tolerate his ongoing cardiogenic
shock and septic shock and passed away on [**2127-9-2**] which
patient had no spontaneous respirations.  Cause of death is
cardiogenic and combined septic shock.

2. Renal:  Patient had chronic renal insufficiency with
bilateral renal artery stenosis.  His creatinine had risen
from 2.5 to 3.5.  Again, Renal was consulted at this time,
however, due to cardiac issues, patient had further renal
insult with the Lasix, dopamine, and dobutamine combination,
patient however, passed away before his renal issues
resolved.

3. ID:  Patient went into septic shock with WBCs increasing
to 45 and temperature up to 102 when transferred back to the
CCU.  Patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for
aspiration community acquired pneumonia.  Patient, however,
passed away secondary to cardiogenic and septic shock before
this issue resolved.

4. GI:  Patient while on the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service had colonic
pseudo-obstruction, which was resolving.  A rectal tube was
placed temporarily to help the colonic pseudo-obstruction.
However, patient remained pseudo-obstructed when the patient
passed away.

5. Pulmonary:  Please see cardiac note.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient again passed away and no autopsy
was done.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Likely cardiogenic and septic shock.
