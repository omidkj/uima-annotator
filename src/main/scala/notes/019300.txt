similar symptoms in past few weeks but the clinical presentation
worsened since a routine bronchoscopy and pulmonary toilet about

noted that he was at time agitated and hallucinating before

began in the feet prior to extending to both arms and legs. In

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the surgical ICU on [**2136-12-30**]. Initial
investigations include a neurologic (EEG, head CT, blood test
for vit. B12 and folic acid), an ID (urine, blood and sputum
cultures) and a pulmonary (bronchoscopy, BAL and cultures) work
up. Patient received CPAP + PS via his trache and was started on
IV fluids, Vancomycin, Meropenem and Fluconazole. All narcotic
medication were halted as opiate overdose was identified as a
potential etiology to his neurologic deterioration. A Tegretol
weaning procedure was also initiated. On hospitalization day
(HD) 2, tube feeds were resumed via the J-tube. Patient was
slightly more arousable. On HD 3, he underwent a bronchoscopy
for evaluation of a chronic R lower lobe
atelectasis/consolidation as a potential septic source. BAL
cultures were initiated. A head CT and EEG were normal. On HD 4
and 5, patient progressed clinically as he was increasingly
awake and abnormal movements diminished progressively. Tube
feeds were advanced towards a goal rate of 100 ml/hr. On HD6,
cultures from BAL revealed Pseudomonas sensitive only to
Tobramycin. The patient was started on IV Tobramycin as
Meropenem and Vancomycin were halted. The Gram stain had also
showed 4+ budding yeast but no growth was observed on the
cultures. The L axillary PICC line was occluded. Interventionnal
radiology attempted to place a new line over the wire but
remained unsuccesful as the L axillary vein was thrombosed. A
[**Last Name (un) **] PICC line was placed ([**2137-1-4**]) in the L brachial vein
and Coumadin anticoagulation initiated upon his return to the
SICU. The J-tube's sutures broke; the was reinserted and sutured
in place with 5-0 steel sutures. On HD 7 and 8, patient was
stable, improving clinically; he was discharged to the [**Hospital1 12004**] facility on [**2137-1-7**] (HD9) in good condition,
breathing on his trache w/ CPAP and PS, alert and oriented, w/o
neurological impairment, able to eat pureed solids (under
supervision) and tolerating tube feeds.

Important follow up instructions include:
1.  Continue Tegretol with last dose of 100 mg on Wednesday
[**2137-1-9**], then stop the medication. This was weaned during
hospitalization based on neurology recommendatons.
2.  Continue Tobramycin at least 2 weeks, 160mg/kg q24hr dosing,
check peak (goal 8-10mcg/ml), trough (< 2mcg/ml):  pseudomonas +
BAL culture from [**1-1**] sensitive to Tobramycin; will need follow
up BAL!
3.  Continue Fluconazole:  BAL w/ 4+ budding yeast, culture w/
negative growth to date.
4.  Continue impact with fiber tube feeds to goal of [**3-15**]
strength @ 110cc/hr.
5.  Continue normal saline 100cc/hr through [**1-8**]. His BUN has
trended up and he is slightly intravascularly volume depleted
due to recent infection and ileostomy output.
6.  Please do not use tincture of opium.
7.  Continue to adjust coumadin dosing for a goal INR of [**3-15**] for
6 months for newly diagnosed L axillary DVT
8.  [**Month (only) 116**] offer pureed solids under direct supervision
