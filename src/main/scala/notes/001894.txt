History of Present Illness:
70 year old male with history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma,
s/p 4 cycles of R-CHOP, 4 cycles of ESHAP and one cycle of [**Hospital1 **]
and Zevalin, discharged recently (2 days PTA) after elective
admission for mini-MUDS. He is now day 27 status post a
nonablative allogeneic transplant with Campath conditioning. His
recent admission was c/b febrile neutropenia (no source
identified, treated empirically with vanc, cefepime, flagyl and
caspo, then subsequently weaned off of these agents), anorexia
requiring TPN, diarrhea (c. diff negative x6) and transiently
elevated LFTs of unknown etiology (negative ultrasounds). By the
time of discharge he was tolerating po's well, had been afebrile
for >1week, was constipated and was ambulating. Today he
presented to clinic and was noted to have shaking chills and
temp to 100.6. He says yesteday he had loose stools (had been
given stool softeners on day of admission due to constipation)
and his wife feels his line "looks worse". Peripheral and line
cultures were drawn in clinic. He was given 1 gram of Vancomycin
IV and 2grams of Cefipime and a liter of normal saline with 2
grams of Magnesium Sulfate while in clinic. He was admitted for
evaluation of low grade fever.
.
The patient reports that his overall energy level and endurance
has been improving. Denies any drenching nightsweats. He denies
any fevers. He is without any pain. He denies any new or
worsening lymphadenopathy. Notes that he feels as though his
left submandibular node as well as left inguinal node has gotten
smaller. Also feels as though his splenomegaly may have improved
somewhat. He denies any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
palpitations, or any other cardiac or respiratory difficulties.
Denies any pain anywhere, denies any shortness of breath upon
exertion.  Denies any vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  Does
continue with a little bit of nausea. He says that he has had
intermittent R and L LQ abdominal pain with bloating that is
relieved with BMs. He is starting to feel some now and would
like a stool softener. Denies any numbness or tingling in the
fingers or toes.


Past Medical History:
1. Diffuse large cell lymphoma
- Initially presented with splenomegaly [**7-2**], found to have
bulky disease above and below diaphram
- S/p 4 cycles of R-CHOP and then switched to ESHAP due to
disease progression. Had persistent pelvic nodes and new
inguinal node after second cycle of ESHAP. Autologous transplant
planned so underwent stem cell mobilization but had poor cell
collection. Restaging PET scans revealed progressive disease
both above and below diaphram. He was therefore treated with
gemzar/navelbine/prednisone with only partial response.
- S/P 3rd cycle of ESHAP [**1-12**] discharged [**1-17**].
- S/P 4th Cycle of ESHAP ([**2168-2-3**])
- S/P [**Hospital1 **] + Zevalin ([**2168-3-22**])
- s/p CAMPATH and mini-MUDS ([**2168-5-3**])
2. s/p cataract surgery
3. left inguinal hernia
4. Right UPJ Stone

IMAGING:
[**2168-5-30**] PORTABLE CXR- In comparison with the study of [**5-18**], there
is no interval change. Minimal streak of atelectasis at the left
base above the slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm. No evidence
of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. Central catheter

.
CT TORSO W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-5-31**] 2:27 PM
CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple mediastinal
lymph nodes have slightly increased in size and number.
Bilateral axillary lymph nodes have also increased in size.
Largest left axillary lymph node measures 12 mm, compared to 8
mm in short axis diameter previously.
Central airways are patent to the segmental levels bilaterally.
Lung windows continue to demonstrate biapical scarring. Numerous
pulmonary nodules are again noted. Right upper lobe pulmonary
nodule, series 2, image 18, has slightly increased in size. Left
upper lobe pulmonary nodule, series 2, image 21, remains stable
in size. Peripheral right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, series 2,
image 24, has slightly increased in size, measuring 3 mm
compared to 1.5 mm previously. Left upper lobe pulmonary nodule,
series 2, image 33, measures 5 mm, compared to 3 mm previously.
Multiple other nodules are stable in size.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Numerous hypodense
splenic lesions have increased in size and number. Multiple
hypodense lesions in the hepatic parenchyma also appear more
prominent on today's study. Right adrenal nodule is stable.
Extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy has
significantly increased in extent when compared to the prior
study. There is no free air and no free fluid in the abdomen.
The pancreas, abdominal loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The 7-mm calculus at the right
ureterovesical junction is unchanged in size and appearance.
Marked lymphadenopathy is present in the pelvis along the
internal and external iliac chains.

BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no definite evidence of suspicious
lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval significant worsening of mediastinal, axillary,
retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, as well as
slight increase in size of pulmonary nodules and splenic
lesions, concerning for disease progression.
2. More prominent appearance of the hepatic lesions.

SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:
DIAGNOSIS: Hypocellular bone marrow with erythroid and
megakaryocytic dysplasia. See note.
Histiocytes with ingested hematopoietic cells. See note.
No diagnostic morphologic features of involvement by lymphoma
seen.
Note 1: The dyspoiesis may be related to recent chemotherapy.
Note 2:  Several histiocytes with ingested hematopoietic
precursors were noted. Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Correlation with clinical findings as well as
other laboratory findings is needed to exclude the possibility
of an evolving hemophagocytic process.
