CXR [**9-24**]:IMPRESSION:  More extensive parenchymal infiltrate in
right mid lung field exceeding the previously described hilar
prominence and densities related to patient's lung cancer shown
by CT.  The now present parenchymal infiltrates may represent
the clinically suspected infection and followup chest
examinations after treatment is recommended

CXR [**9-25**]: FINDINGS: Compared with the study of [**9-24**], there has
been further interval consolidation of the right mid lung
infiltrate.

LENIs:FINDINGS: Bilateral [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**]
of the lower extremities including the common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. Normal
flow, augmentation and waveforms were demonstrated. Mid portion
of the left superficial femoral was poorly compressible, but
intraluminal thrombus was not identified.

IMPRESSION: No acute DVT.
