Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84yo male with a history of congestive heart failure and
multiple recent admissions was admitted from home with increased
light-headedness and found to have acute renal failure.
.
He reports feeling light-headed with exertion with an episode
the morning of admission of presyncope where he lowered himself
to the ground hurting his back. He reports no LOC or hitting his
head. He reports sensation of knees buckling. He had a second
episode today when he walked in to get his blood drawn at
clinic. He was asymptomatic at rest. According to his daughter,
his systolic blood pressure was in the 60-70s over the previous
few days and was in the 80s on the day of admission. Also of
note, weight up from 201-205 over 2 days.
.
Review of systems.

The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, new exertional
dyspnea, orthopnea, PND or leg edema, palpitations,
claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or
transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit
or urinary symptoms. No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias,
myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of systems
negative.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 104757**]/09
for dyspnea and CHF exacerbation. He was initially requiring
noninvasive ventilation in the ED. His [**Date range (1) 113**] on admission
demonstrated worsening MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was diuresed initially with a
lasix gtt and was then transitioned to torsemide 80mg [**Hospital1 **] and
metolazone. Given a rise in his creatinine on the 48 hours prior
to discharge, he was ultimately discharged on a regimen of
torsemide 60mg [**Hospital1 **] without metolazone. His weight on admission
was 106kg and on the day of discharge was 92kg. Regarding his
MR, he was continued with medical management given that he was
not interested in surgical repair.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, vital signs were 97.6, HR 55, BP 75/44,
and 100% on 2L. His exam was notable for clear lungs, no
peripheral edema. His labs were notable for mild hyponatremia at
130, acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.3. He was given
ibuprofen 600mg PO x 1. He received 1L NS with some improvement
in his blood pressure. 62 / 78/47 / 20 / 98% on 2L.

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo male with a history of diastolic CHF, hypertension, and
severe mitral regurgitation was admitted with acute on chronic
diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic renal insufficiency,
and hyponatremia.
.
1. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury-Etiology of his acute kidney
injury is likely related to pre-renal causes such as aggressive
diuresis, starting an ACEI, and a fluid restricted PO intake.
Patient received 1L normal saline in the ED and received another
1.5L in CCU. Additional possibilities include allergic
interstitial nephritis secondary to metolazone as this was a new
medication for him during his previous admission. Post-renal
causes are also possible given his BPH, although he has been
draining urine without problem. [**Name (NI) **] consistent with prerenal
azotemia.  Creatinine improved to baseline with conservative
care and holding diureses and AceI.
.
2. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure-Patient
has had very difficult to manage heart failure in the past,
resulting in multiple frequent admissions and aggressive
diuresis. Patient's discharge regimen was torsemide 60mg [**Hospital1 **]
which was a marked increase from his previous regimen of
furosemide 80mg daily. Dry weight is ~97kg. Held torsemide on
admission bc of ARF but restarted 20mg PO BID upon discharge
when renal function returned to baseline. Resumed ACEI in the
setting of acute renal failure. Held off on resuming BB because
of borderline low BP.
.
3. Hypotension- He was asymptomatic at rest and mentating well.
Patient's discharge SBP was in the 80s so low baseline to start.
That coupled with reinstiution of antihypertensives for needed
for CHF and volume depletion in the setting of overdiuresis were
likely. Received 2L fluids and BP improved along with UO.
.
4. Mitral Regurgitation- Patient had a history of mitral
regurgitation and on a recent [**Hospital1 113**], this was noted to be
worsened over the last 2-3 months. Patient has been undergoing
medical therapy as he does not want surgery.  Restarted
torsemide 20mg PO bid and lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily to keep
patient I/O even.
.
5. h/o DVTs-Patient was supratherapeutic upon discharge and INR
therapeutic now. Continue coumadin 4mg daily if within INR [**2-20**].

.
6. Multiple Myeloma-Patient is followed at [**Company 2860**] and has been
maintained on dexamethasone.  Continue to hold dexamethasone
secondary to fluid overload.
.
7. BPH -Patient has a history of BPH and bladder spasms. Held
finasteride for hypotension but consider restarting as
outpatient.
.
8. Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Patient has known sleep apnea,
although he does not use CPAP at home. Will continue oxygen at
night for comfort.

# Back PAin -Patient felt like his fall prior to admission
exacerbated old back injury. No neurologic deficits nor TTP.
Improved with standing tylenol and monitor for improvement
.
# General Care cardiac - low sodium diet; replete electrolytes
prn, Access: 2 PIVs, CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed on admission, PPx:
DVT ppx - anticoagulated on coumadin; Bowel regimen - senna and
docusate, Disp: to rehab
