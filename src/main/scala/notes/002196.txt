Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall, with a left facial droop, neglect the left hemispace, and
right gaze deviation

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is an 89 RHF with complex PMH including PVD, CAD,
HTN, DMII, hypercholesterolemia, and afib on coumadin who fell
at home at 2:45.  She was feeling well and was on the telephone
prior to the fall.  She bent down to write something that was
being told to her on the phone.  She fell out of her chair and
found herself unable to get up.  She was able to call for help
from the front desk at her [**Hospital3 **] facility.  She was
brought in by EMS.  Initial finger stick was 123. On arrival
here the patient was noted to have a left facial droop, neglect
the left hemispace, and have right gaze deviation.
Code stroke called at 3:26. Her initial NIHSS was deferred for
head imaging given the patient's anticoagulation and suspected
hemorrhage. NIHSS:Total score 10.

Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2147-8-25**]  3:20:54 PM
Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V block. Borderline left axis
deviation with
probable left anterior fascicular block. Lateral ST-T wave
changes. Cannot
rule out myocardial ischemia.

CXR [**2147-8-26**]
Ill-defined opacities worse in the bases and more so in the left

side are worrisome for aspiration given the provided clinical
history,
although there are no prior studies available for comparison to
assess its
chronicity. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
There is
mild cardiomegaly.

Pelvis AP X-Ray [**2147-8-26**]
There are no fractures. Mild degenerative changes are in the
right hip joint. Moderate degenerative changes are in the lower
lumbar spine. Right femoral catheter is in place. Surgical clips
are in the left pelvis. Contrast material is in the bladder and
partially obscures the sacrum.

Left Wrist X-ray [**2147-8-28**]
Three radiographs of the left wrist demonstrate diffuse
demineralization.
There is moderate-to-severe subchondral sclerosis, joint space
narrowing, and marginal osteophyte formation about the first CMC
joint. Chondrocalcinosis about the radiocarpal and intercarpal
joint spaces is present. No discrete fracture is identified. The
regional soft tissues are unremarkable.

CThead/CTA/CT perfusion  [**2147-8-25**]
1. Acute distal M1 occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery
with large at risk region of ischemic penumbra.
2. Calcified atherosclerotic plaque involving the carotid
arteries
bilaterally with 50% stenosis at the origin of the left internal
carotid
artery and 20% at the right. Heavy calcified atherosclerotic
plaques are
present within bilateral carotid siphons.
3. Atheromatous ulcerations within the aortic arch only
partially evaluated on this study.
4. Diffuse interstitial abnormality within the lung apices .
Dedicated CT of the chest may be warranted as clinically
indicated.

MRI of the head [**2147-8-26**]
Areas of small infarcts in the distribution of right middle
cerebral artery without evidence of mass effect, midline shift,
hydrocephalus
or signs of hemorrhage.

MRA of the head [**2147-8-26**]
Motion limited study demonstrating flow signal in both middle
cerebral arteries without evidence of occlusion.

ECHO (TTE) [**2147-8-29**]
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic
function. Mild right ventricular dilation with preserved
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

[**2147-8-28**]  VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW
The study was performed in collaboration with the speech and
swallow service. In brief, the oral phase was unremarkable with
the exception of mild pre-spillage of thin liquids. Pharyngeal
phase was notable for episodes of flash penetration with sips of
thin liquid that
cleared with swallowing. No episodes of aspiration were seen.
  IMPRESSION: Pre-spillage and flash penetration with thin
liquids. No episodes of aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] was admitted on the [**8-25**], she had a right
MCA syndrome that was confirmed by a CT brain perfusion study.
Her initial NIHSS was 10.  Her INR precluded IV TPA.  She
therefore received intra-arterial 5 mg TPA. She was intubated
for the procedure and successfully extubated. Her neurological
examination significantly improved prior to discharge: language
was normal, and she had a very mild right sided hemiparesis, and
was able to walk with a walker.

Hospital course is reviewed by the following problem list:
