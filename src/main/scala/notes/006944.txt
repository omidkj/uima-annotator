Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old female with small bowel AVMs, aortic stenosis, CHF,
admitted with weakness and acute decrease in Hct due to a GI
Bleed.

#. GI Bleed: She most likely had a GI bleed causing acute blood
loss and her presenting symptoms of lightheadedness and
dizziness.  She had an enteroscopy that showed an angioectasia
of the stomach and the duodenum that was the most likely source
and both sites were cauterized.  She was also recently started
aspirin which was held during this hospitalization and she was
instructed to discuss with her outpatient PCP whether or not to
restart it.  She may need an outpatient colonoscopy in the
future given her history of questionable GI tract plasmacytoma
and her ongoing anemia.  After the enteroscopy, her hematocrit
remained stable and her dizziness had resolved.  She was
discharged on a po PPI [**Hospital1 **].

#. Congestive heart failure: She had a BNP below previous
numbers in the system and she appeared generally hypovolemic.
Her Lasix and beta blocker were held initially but restarted
prior to discharge.

#. Hyperglycemia: She was managed on an insulin sliding scale
and should have PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] regarding hyperglycemia.

#. Code Status: Full code, confirmed
