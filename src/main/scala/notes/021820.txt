Date of Birth:  [**2151-12-23**]             Sex:   M

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Magnesium Citrate / Penicillins / Gabapentin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10682**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache, hypoxia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Midline placement
Mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
48 yo male with h/o multiple medical comorbidities, severe OSA
s/p tracheostomy in [**2198**], triplegia secondary to electruciation,
chronic pain syndrome s/p intrathecal [**Year (4 digits) **] with Bupivacaine
pump implantation transferred from OSH for continued management
of acute on chronic respiratory failure.

Per patient had been in USOH when noted gradual onset of
inability to properly use left hand, myoclonic jerking and
confusion. He presented to OSH on [**1-15**] where he was noted to
have increasing O2 requirement (at baseline FiO2: 35-40%) on
arrival necessitating 100%.

Regarding respiratory failure. Patient with a history of
multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to severe OSA, COPD
and neuromuscular weakness that culminated in tracheostomy 6mths
prior. For the last 4mths he was required 24 ventilation with
assist control. No documented hypoxia in OSH hospital only
documentation of vent settings at 100% FiO2. Hypoxia work-up
included upper and lower extremity ultrasounds: negative for
DVT; TTE without intracardiac shunt. Patient was found to have
increased secretions and questionable infiltrate on CXR. A
bronchscopy was performed which demonstrated
trachiobronchimalacia. Bronchial washings and sputum cultures
were obtained which later grew out psuedomonas. Patient was
initially treated with Levofloxacin and tigacylin, which was
later transitioned to inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivites.
Prior to transfer FiO2 had been weaned from 100% -> 70% with
stable sats.

Regarding altered mental status and myoclonic jerking. Patient
with increasing confusion and myoclonus prior. Neurology
consulted. CT head negative. EEG negative. Myoclonic jerking was
attributed to [**Month/Year (2) **] toxicity as jerking resolved with initial
[**Month/Year (2) **] dose reduction. AMS change was attributed to [**Month/Year (2) **]
toxicity with contribution from hypoxia and UTI (urine cx +
pseudomonas). Prior to transfer mental status returned to
baseline.

At time of transfer patient was oxygenating well on Assist
Control: VT: 600 RR: 12 PEEP: 7.5 FiO2: 70%. VS: Tm 99.2  BP:
100-120s/50s-70s  HR: 70s-80s

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], VSS. Patient reports mental status is
back to baseline though reports persistent headache with
associated left hand parathesias. Denies SOB though reports
persistent chest heaviness and green secretions - though states
he feels secretion amount has lessened since Abx initiation.

ROS
+ sweats/chills, dysuria, + left hand numbness/tingling
- nausea, vomiting, diarrhea - last BM 2 days prior

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2200-1-22**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there may be
slight decrease in the persistent opacification at the right
base. Left basilar opacification persists. Again, the appearance
is consistent with pneumonia, though there may be some element
of atelectasis. Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
