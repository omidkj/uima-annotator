Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old female
patient with dilated cardiomyopathy who had previously been
referred to the Heart Failure Service, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], here at
[**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation for heart
transplant and refractory heart failure.

As part of her work-up, she underwent a right heart
catheterization, as well as an echocardiogram which revealed
severe mitral regurgitation with moderate mitral stenosis.
She also was found to have an atrial septal aneurysm.  She
has been accepted as a transplant candidate; however, due to
increasing symptomatology, she was referred to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service here for a mitral valve
replacement and ASD repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.  2.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  3.  The patient is
status post biventricular pacemaker with an ICD.  4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Amaril 2 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 20
mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Zyrtec 10 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Digoxin
0.125 mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Cozaar 50 mg
p.o. q.d., Asthmacort 2 puffs b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denied alcohol or tobacco use.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon admission to the hospital laboratory
values were unremarkable with the exception of a creatinine
of 1.6.

Her echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of less than 20%, with an atrial septal defect and
3+ mitral regurgitation.

Cardiac catheterization on [**2-19**] revealed normal coronary
arteries.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was subsequently taken to the
Operating Room on [**2189-3-11**], where she underwent mitral
valve replacement with a 27 mm mosaic tissue valve.  She also
had a resection of a septal aneurysm, as well as repair of an
atrial septal defect using a Dacron patch.

Postoperatively the patient was placed on Milrinone and
Levophed IV drip and transported from the Operating Room to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in satisfactory condition.

She remained in the Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative
day #1, she was weaned from the ventilator and successfully
extubated.  She had some episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia for which the Electrophysiology Service was
consulted.  They recommended initially, on postoperative day
#2, was to start Lidocaine IV drip and to try to wean the
patient off the Milrinone which had been progressing slowly.

The patient remained weaned from Milrinone over the next few
days with acceptable hemodynamic parameters.  She remained on
Lidocaine infusion.  She continued to be ventricularly paced
via her permanent pacemaker which was placed preoperatively.
She had occasional premature ventricular contractions at that
time, but no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia once
she was placed on Lidocaine.

The patient's chest tubes had been discontinued on
postoperative day #3.  The patient's epicardial wires were
discontinued shortly thereafter without event.  Gentle
diuresis was begun on postoperative day #4, and Coumadin was
started for anticoagulation due to her low ejection fraction
and ventricular arrhythmia.

On postoperative day #6, the patient's pacemaker/ICD was
interrogated and found to be functioning appropriately with
all parameters acceptable.  It was also the recommendation of
the Electrophysiology Service to transition the patient from
IV Lidocaine to oral Mexiletine at 150 mg b.i.d. due to the
postoperative ventricular arrhythmia.

The patient was also started on Losartan.  She has documented
previous intolerance to ACE inhibitors, as evidenced by
severe cough.  She was then placed on Losartan and was on
Mexiletine and was continuing the Milrinone wean on
postoperative day #8.  She was also initiated on TB drugs,
Isoniazid 300 mg p.o. q.d. and Pyridoxine.  Both of these are
to be continued for nine months, and they were initiated due
to a positive skin test by PPD with no evidence of TB by her
chest x-ray.

Over the next few days, the patient continued to wean very
slowly off of her Milrinone.  She remained to have some
issues with anxiety which were treated with low-dose Ativan,
and she responded very well to this.

On postoperative day #8, the patient was resumed on her
Carvedilol.  She was successfully off of her Milrinone.  She
was beginning to progress with Physical Therapy.  The patient
was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry
Floor on postoperative day #9, where she continued to
progress with Physical Therapy and Cardiac Rehabilitation.

Her diuresis was increased.  She had no further episodes of
ventricular tachycardia, although she has had isolated
premature ventricular contractions on the Mexiletine.  It was
the recommendation of the Electrophysiology Service to only
add a Class III antiarrhythmic if she had further episodes of
ventricular tachycardia.  It was their recommendation to use
Amiodarone unless the patient is to be listed for cardiac
transplant; in that case, they recommended use of Dofetilide.
We have not initiated either of those since she has had no
further ventricular tachycardia.

The patient has been followed here during her postoperative
course by the Heart Failure Service and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  We
have increased her Carvedilol to 6.25 mg twice a day.  We
have increased her Losartan to 50 mg, and the patient has
hemodynamically tolerated those well.

Today, [**2189-3-24**], the patient remains hemodynamically
stable; however, not able to fully ambulate great distances
without tiring, and it was felt best that the patient be
transferred to a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation facility to
increase physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation.

Most recent laboratory values are from today, [**3-24**], which
include a white blood cell count of 9000, hematocrit 33.7,
platelet count 371; sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 106,
CO2 26, BUN 18, creatinine 1.0, glucose 65; PT 13.8, INR 1.3.

The patient has been slow to progress with becoming
therapeutic on her Coumadin with an INR that has ranged from
1.1-1.3.  Her dose was increased yesterday, [**3-23**], to 5 mg
a day from previously getting 3 mg.  Her target INR is
2.0-2.5, and she is being anticoagulated for her decreased
left ventricular ejection fraction, as well as some
postoperative arrhythmias, and she should continue to have
her Coumadin increased as necessary to achieve a target INR
of 2.0-2.5.

Most recent chest x-ray from [**3-21**] showed a resolving left
pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.

Vitals signs today are a temperature of 98??????, pulse 100,
respirations 18, blood pressure 94/52, oxygen saturation 96%
on room air.  Weight today is 71 kg.  Her preoperative weight
is 72.3.  Her fingerstick blood sugars have ranged from
70-140 on her oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
