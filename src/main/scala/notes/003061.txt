for scheduled surgical resection of a biopsied confirmed
carcinoma of the esophagus, T2 lesion without evidence of
positive lymph nodes.

Submandibular gland excision

Social History:
Married, works as a dentist; seven drinks per week, non-smoker

Family History:

Pertinent Results:
Operative report [**1-27**]:
Carcinoma of the esophagus. .

PROCEDURES:  Minimally invasive total esophagectomy with
laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy.

Chest x-ray [**1-28**]:
There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusions. Right
chest tubes in position. NG tube tip in unchanged position. Left
lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis is peristent. Improved right
lower lobe and left mid zone atelectasis. There has been no
change in the cardiomediastinal contour in the postoperative
period.

Barrium esophageal swallow [**2-1**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of anastomotic leak on barium
esophagram.

Chest x-ray [**2-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening asymmetrical alveolar and interstitial opacities in
the right lung, which may be due to asymmetrical pulmonary
edema, but superimposed aspiration in the perihilar region is
also possible given the clinical suspicion.
2. Interval placement of nasogastric tube with decreased
distention of pull-up.

Abdominal x-ray [**2-4**]:
FINDINGS: Supine and upright films of the abdomen were obtained.
There is persistent left retrocardiac opacity and a left-sided
effusion. A right-sided chest tube is present as well as
partially visualized right lower lung opacities. There has been
progression of contrast through the colon which is now seen
extending to the rectum. Gas distended loops of predominantly
large bowel may be slightly decreased compared to prior study.
There is no evidence for free intraperitoneal air. A linear area
of contrast noted in the right lower quadrant, which likely
represents a normally filled appendix. The osseous structures
are unchanged.

Chest x-ray [**2-5**]:
Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung, particularly the
axillary subsegments is improving, suggesting resolution of
aspiration. The neoesophagus remains severely distended with
fluid. Left lung is clear and the heart is normal size. No
pneumothorax noted. Small right pleural effusion is new since
[**2-3**], small left pleural effusion unchanged

ENT evaluation [**2-6**]:
IMPRESSION/PLAN:
71yM s/p lap esophagogastrectomy now with mild hoarseness and
aspiration. His laryngoscopy is essentially normal with normal
vocal cord function and no evidence that he is unable to
tolerate
his secretions. Recommend [**Hospital1 **] PPI therapy and humidification if
possible. I would expect improvement in his voice an, depending
on what his video swallow shows, eventual improvement in his
swallow coordination.
We will follow up on his video swallow and are available for any
additional questions or concerns.

Speech and swallow therapy [**2-8**]:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet texture of pureed solids and nectar thick liquids.
Po
medications can be given crushed in puree or via J-tube.
2. Aspiration precautions, as follows:
 a. Take small bites/sip.
 b. Swallow 3 times for each bite & sip.
 c. Alternate each bite with a sip.
3. Outside of meals, the pt may be allowed small amounts of thin
liquids (without any other solids) using a chin tuck maneuver.
4.
Repeat video swallow study in the next 10-14 days to monitor for
any further resolution of unilateral pharyngeal paresis in hopes
that the pt's po diet may be upgraded.

Video swallow [**2-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pharyngeal residue due to decreased
laryngeal valve/airway closure and bolus propulsion. This leads
to mild-to-moderate aspiration with thin liquids.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104432**] had no intra-operative complications,
post-operatively he was NPO with intravenous hydration, Dilaudid
PCA, and intravenous beta-blockade for optimal heart rate and
blood pressure; he had a neck [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] drain, right chest
tube, [**Doctor Last Name **] drain, j-tube, nasogastric tube, and foley catheter;
he was transferred to the SICU for close monitoring.

POD 1: Chest tube removed, Toradol added for optimal pain
control.
POD 2: Tube feeds started, nasogastric tube removed, aggressive
pulmonary toileting, transferred to in-patient nursing unit
POD 4: Desaturation with emesis, improved with oxygen therapy,
transferred back to SICU for aspiration, nasogastric tube
replaced, broad spectrum antibiotics started, temperature with
leukocytosis of 12k.
POD 6: Oxygenating well with nasal cannula, productive cough,
afebrile, antibiotics discontinued, barium esophageal swallow
negative for an anastomotic leak, chest x-ray with opacities in
right lung, transferred back to in-patient nursing unit, all
medications given through jejunostomy tube including oral
beta-blockade and proton pump inhibitor, tube feeds continued,
pain well controlled with Oxycodone elixir and Morphine as
needed; aggressive physical and chest therapy for ambulation,
coughing, and deep breathing continued, ambulating with
assistance.
POD 7: Nasogastric tube and foley catheter removed; foley
replaced secondary to urinary retention, diet advanced,
oxygenating well on room air.
POD 8: Abdominal distention with +flatus, tube feeds held,
abdominal x-ray demonstrated ileus, NPO with intravenous
hydration resumed, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **] drain removed.
POD 9: Speech and swallow therapy evaluation with aspiration of
thin liquids and hoarse voice, abdomen soft, +flatus and bowel
movement.
POD 11: ENT consult with laryngoscopy revealed normal vocal
cords function. Foley catheter removed with patient voiding
without difficulty, tolerating tube feeds.
POD 12: Video swallow confirmed right side unilateral pharyngeal
weakness; diet advanced to regular pureed solids and nectar
thick liquids. He tolerated minimal amount of diet, all
medications either crushed in puree or given through J tube.
Tolerating tube feeds of replete with fiber 2/3 strength to
reach goal of 120mL. Pain well controlled with Roxicet,
oxygenating well on room air, ambulating with assistance, and
chest physical therapy continued with good mobilization of
secretions.

Discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] rehabilitation center in stable
condition on [**2-9**]. He was to have a repeat video swallow in
