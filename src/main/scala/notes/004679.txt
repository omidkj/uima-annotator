Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Flexiseal
Foley Catheter
Central Line


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86 yoM w/ a h/o afib (on coumadin) sent in
from home to [**Hospital3 4107**] as his VNA was unable to pass a
foley.  He was found to be in afib w/ a rate of 140s and
shortness of breath.  While in the [**Hospital3 4107**] ER the
patient was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  He was given 20mg
IV diltiazem and his BP had dropped- given this a IJ CVL was
placed and the patient was started on neo.  He was given 500cc
IVF in [**Hospital3 **].  He was guaiac negative, INR was 2.6 and
he was given 1 dose of protonix given a history his family had
provided of 2 episodes of dark emesis earlier in the day.

The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER- in the
ambulance he was given 40mg IV lasix.

In the ED, initial VS: T 103.9 (improved to 101.6 w/ tylenol),
HR 110, BP 102/60.  Prior to transport VS were T 101.6 HR 84, BP
112/72, 100% on AC 500 x 16, PEEP 5 and FiO2 50%.  He was given
nearly 2 liters of fliud.  He was also given 4.5g IV zosyn. The
patient was intubated for tachypnea,

Currently, the patient is intubated, sedated and unable to
answer history questions.

.
[**2147-12-26**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Left
anterior fascicular block. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
[**2147-12-26**] CXR: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Low inspiratory lung
volumes and slight patient rotation somewhat limit assessment.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is
tortuous. Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip
terminates at the confluence of brachiocephalic veins. There are
increased interstitial markings diffusely, findings suggestive
of mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Blunting of the right
costophrenic sulcus also suggest an element of pleural effusion
on the right. There is no pneumothorax. Subtle right inferior
anterior rib deformities suggest prior fractures in these
regions. Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are
noted.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. Small right
pleural
effusion.
.
[**2147-12-26**] Scrotal US: IMPRESSION: Large heterogeneous collection
seen with associated rim calcification within the right scrotum,
measuring up to 10.6 cm, with no definitive right testis
identified. This may be post-traumatic in etiology and represent
a chronic hematoma. Normal left testicle. Extensive scrotal
edema.
.
[**2147-12-26**] CT abd/pel: 1. Large 6.0 x 6.6 cm rim-calcified cystic
lesion within the right scrotal sac thought to be likely
post-traumatic in nature with associated compression of the
right testis. No subcutaneous air to suggest necrotizing
fasciitis. 2. Bladder collapsed about the Foley catheter with
suggestion of possible bladder wall thickening, and mild
bilateral hydroureter with mild thickening and enhancement of
the urothelium. Findings are compatible with the patient's
history of known urosepsis. Multiple small subcentimeter
hypodensities scattered throughout both kidneys, too small to
accurately characterize and may represent simple cysts, however,
abscesses are not excluded, particularly a small ill-defined
hypodensity within the interpolar region of the left kidney. No
associated striated nephrogram to suggest pyelonephritis. 8mm
right sided renal calculus. 4. Distended gallbladder with
associated pericholecystic fluid. Recommend ultrasound for
further evaluation to exclude cholecystitis. 5. Infrarenal
abdominal aorta aneurysm measuring up to 3.3 cm, and aneurysmal
dilatation of the bilateral common iliac arteries. 6.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
[**2147-12-26**] RUQ US: IMPRESSION: Gallbladder wall distention with
sludge but no stones. Mild wall edema and trace pericholecystic
fluid. Findings could be consistent with cholecystitis in the
appropriate clinical setting.
.
[**2147-12-27**] ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. The ascending aorta may be dilated
but is not well visualized. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
