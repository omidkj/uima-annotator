Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest Pain
REASON FOR MICU ADMISSION: Hypotension, need for dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVVH

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17839**] is a 53 y/oM with h/o of ESRD on HD h/o MI and
CABG, DM presents with chest pain. Over the last several weeks
he has been noticed increased swelling, abdominal girth, and
slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and has developed
orthopnea. He has also developed chest pain that is similar to
prior angina; initially this occured with exertion only but
awoke him from sleep at 2am. He had associated dyspnea and
diaphoresis, but no nausea. He took a sl ntg tablet which
relieved the pain, but the pain later occured at rest in the
morning that did not respond and he called EMS and presented to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. He did take his 81mg asa
this morning.

He is on warfarin for h/o stroke, but was subtherapeutic at 1.6.


In the ED, initial VS:  HR 84 BP 80/p. He was hypoxic to the mid
80s on room air. He was given IVF for hypotension, but only
about 600-700cc given his EF of 25%. There was difficulty in
obtaining IJ access initially, but eventually catheter placement
was successful, but probably terminates in the subclavian.

His troponin was elevated to 0.72 above his baseline of 0.4, and
ECG showed widened QRS and PR prolongation felt to be c/w
hyperkalemia. He also had slight worsening of ST depressions
laterally. He was given calcium, insulin, and glucose, and
admitted to the MICU for CVVH.

In the unit, he c/o [**2-3**] chest discomfort, with BP ranging from
80-90/40s initially. Cardiology consultation was obtained.

================================================================
PORTABLE CXR [**8-24**]
FINDINGS: Single AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph is
obtained. A
dialysis catheter is again noted with a right IJ approach with
its tip in the expected location of the right atrium. Midline
sternotomy wires are again noted. The heart remains moderately
enlarged. Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted which is mild.
There is a stable small right pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac
linear opacity is improved and likely represent residual
atelectasis. Upper lungs are well aerated. Mediastinal contour
is grossly unremarkable. Bones appear grossly intact. The clip
projects over the left lung base medially. Atherosclerotic
calcification along the course of the descending aorta is noted.

IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly, mild congestion, small right pleural effusion.
Improved left
lower lobe atelectasis.
.
.
CTA [**8-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal evaluation of posterior branch pulmonary arteries
due to
pleural effusions and overlying ateletctasis/consolidation as
well as patient respiratory motion. Given this, no evidence of
pulmonary embolus.
2. No aortic dissection. Cardiomegaly.
3. Large right and moderate left pleural effusions with
overlying
atelectasis/consolidation.
.
.
TTE [**8-25**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe biventricular global hypokinesis.
Biventricular cavity dilation. Severe diastolic dysfunction with
elevated filling pressures. Moderate mitral and tricuspid valve
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-3-4**],
left ventricular function has declined. Severe diastolic
dysfunction with elevated cardiac filling pressures is now
apparent. Estimated pulmonary artery pressures are higher. The
severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly decreased.
.
.
Cardiac Cath [**8-27**]:
1. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated patent grafts
(LIMA-LAD,
SVG-diagonal, SVG-PDA). The LAD had a 90% lesion just beyond the

touchdown of the graft and was diffusely diseased. The RCA was
diffusely
diseased up to 90% in the PL branch. The native coronary
arteries were
not engaged.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mild to moderately elevated
right
and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 19 mm Hg, PCWP mean 21
mm Hg).
The pulmonary arterial blood pressure was moderately elevated
(PASP 51
mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was low (SBP 72 mm
Hg, MAP
57 mm Hg). The cardiac index was low at 1.9 l/min/m2.
