Social History:
Her husband died in [**Name (NI) 404**], which was very hard on her. She now
lives alone but goes to Russian "Second Home" adult day care.
She worked as a nurse for 50 years in [**Country 532**]. No tobacco for 40

is in the hospital. Has a great grandson in [**Name (NI) 531**] who is a
doctor. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 802**] was a part-time interpreter at [**Hospital1 18**] and now
works at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital. Children want her to move to [**Location (un) 5426**] soon, but she wants to stay here.


Family History:
Her parents were both killed at Baba Yar in [**Location (un) 3156**] at a young
age, so she is not aware of any health problems they may have

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Aorta - Annulus:  2.7 cm  <= 3.0 cm
Aorta - Sinus Level:  *3.8 cm  <= 3.6 cm
Aorta - Sinotubular Ridge:  *3.1 cm  <= 3.0 cm
Aorta - Ascending:  *4.2 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Arch:  *3.5 cm  <= 3.0 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  *3.9 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch. Moderately dilated descending
aorta Ascending aortic intimal flap/dissection.. Aortic arch
intimal flap/dissection. Descending aorta intimal flap/aortic
dissection. Thickened aortic wall c/w intramural hematoma.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-bypass: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. A mobile density is seen
in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile
density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an
intimal flap/aortic dissection. The aortic wall is thickened
consistent with an intramural hematoma. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass: The patient is receiving no inotropic support
post-CPB. There is an ascending aorta tube graft seen distal to
the sinotubular junction without any changes to the aortic
valve. Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all
other findings are consistent with pre-CPB findings. All
findings were communicated to the surgeon intraoperatively.
