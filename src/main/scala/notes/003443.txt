HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old
female admitted on [**2188-5-30**] status post a mechanical fall
while out shopping and found to have a left femoral neck
fracture.  In the Emergency Department the patient was noted
to have a blood pressure of 60/palpable for several hours
without intervention.  The patient was given aggressive
intravenous fluids, approximately 6 liters.  The patient was
also in atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with INR of 3.8,
heartrate 110.  Blood pressure increased to the 80s systolic
with wide open intravenous fluids.  Right femoral line was
placed in the Emergency Department which was complicated by
several arterial sticks.  Chest x-ray was suggestive of
congestive heart failure.  Following 6 liters of intravenous
fluid the patient was started on Dopamine drip to maintain
systolic blood pressure of 90 which was later changed to
Dobutamine.  A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen
and pelvis showed a right pleural effusion, distended
gallbladder with a small amount of ascites with mesenteric
draining but no evidence of abdominal or retroperitoneal
bleed.  The patient's electrocardiogram was notable for ST
elevation and right-sided V4 leads consistent with
intravenous involving infarct.  Troponin was elevated at 22.
The patient was initially admitted to the Coronary Care Unit
with presumed cardiogenic shock secondary to right
ventricular infarct.

SUMMARY OF MEDICINE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY:  The patient
was maintained on a Dobutamine drip to maintain blood
pressure.  The patient's elevated INR was partially reversed
with Vitamin K.  A bedside echocardiogram showed intravenous
hypokinesis and septal flattening and no evidence of
pericardial effusion or tamponade.  The patient with prerenal
           less than 1 and decreased urine output which was
supported with intravenous fluid boluses.  On [**6-2**] the
patient was febrile to 101.4.  On [**6-3**] the patient was
weaned off of the Dobutamine.  Urinalysis was positive for
enterococcus urinary tract infection and she was started on
Vancomycin and was later switched to Levaquin once
sensitivities returned.  The patient was also started on
Lovenox and Coumadin for anticoagulation for her atrial
fibrillation with her hip fracture.  The patient was also
noted to have increased in lethargy secondary to narcotics
she received for pain control as well as Ativan.  With
minimization of narcotics            the patient's mental
status started to clear.  The patient is still somnolent.
The patient started taking p.o. on [**6-4**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has gastrointestinal intolerance and
mental status changes to Morphine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband who is a
trustee of [**Hospital6 256**], no alcohol
or tobacco history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for sister who died of breast
cancer at age 76, mother who died at age 45 of a
postoperative pulmonary embolus, status post axillary no
dissection.  Father who died at 87 years of valvular heart
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.1, pulse 99, blood
pressure 121/95, respirations 15, oxygen saturation 95% on 2
liters.  In general the patient is somnolent, arousable,
oriented to time of day only, responds to simple commands.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, slightly dry oral mucosa,
no oral lesions, no erythema.  Cardiovascular, tachycardiac,
regular, III/VI systolic murmur in the left upper sternal
border.  The lungs are clear bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft.
Mild right upper quadrant tenderness to palpation with no
rebound or guarding.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities,
no edema.  2+ peripheral pulses.  Right groin, small
ecchymoses, no bruit, no hematoma.  Neurological examination,
moving all four extremities, strength 5/5 throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13.7, hematocrit 33.5,
platelets 205.  Chem-7 sodium 135, potassium 4.7, chloride
115, bicarbonate 21, BUN 70, creatinine 1.2, glucose 125,
magnesium 3.1.  Liver function tests within normal limits.
CK peaked at 222, troponin peaked at 22.7.  Laboratory data
revealed blood cultures negative, urine cultures with
enterococcus sensitive to Levaquin.  Right internal jugular
wound culture, two different Staphylococcus species greater
than 15 colonies, sensitive to Levaquin.  Electrocardiogram,
right ventricular atrial fibrillation, 114, right axis, 1 to
[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1 through V3.  T wave inversions in 2,
3 and AVF.  Prior echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of
greater than 55%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, normal
right ventricle size, no wall motion abnormalities.  Evidence
of right ventricular pressure overload, 2+ mitral
regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  Continuous shunting, arteriovenous shunt.
Heart magnetic resonance imaging scan showed shunt from the
right coronary artery, aneurysm to the right atrium.  Chest
x-ray showed cardiomegaly with no congestive heart failure.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen, no
retroperitoneal or thigh hematoma, positive ascites, distant
gallbladder, moderate right pleural effusions, mild
mesenteric        .  X-ray of the left hip, no pelvic
fracture, left femoral neck fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - The patient had
cardiogenic shock secondary to evolving right ventricular
infarct.  The patient was on Dobutamine drip for four days to
maintain her blood pressure, and was successively weaned off.
The patient was continued on Aspirin but was not given a beta
blocker nor ACE inhibitor since her heart is very preload
dependent in the setting of her right ventricular
dysfunction.  The patient did not have any further cardiac
workup prior to going to the Operating Room for her left hip
fracture.  Intraoperatively Esmolol was used to control her
heartrate and blood pressure.  Postoperatively the patient's
CKs remained flat, electrocardiogram unchanged.  Repeat
echocardiogram showed a preserved ejection fraction greater
than 55%, moderate left atrial and right atrial enlargement,
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right
ventricular dilation and      septal motion consistent with
right ventricular overload, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 2+
tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension,
moderate pericardial effusions.

2.  Atrial fibrillation - The patient was anticoagulated with
Lovenox before her operation and then started on Coumadin
postoperatively.

3.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia - The patient had a
run of 4 to 5 beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
as late as hospital day #10 and 11.  The patient's potassium
and magnesium were kept well repleted.  If the patient
continues to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia she
will be started on a low dose beta blocker.  One is hesitant
to start a beta blocker given the patient's history of second
degree heartblock in addition to right bundle branch block.

4.  Pulmonary - The patient has a history of chronic right
pleural effusions.  The patient's oxygen saturation remained
stable throughout her hospitalization.  She will eventually
need thoracentesis +/- pleurodes
