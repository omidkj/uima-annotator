18K. He was also started on Vanco/Cefepime. Blood, urine and
sputum cultures were sent. His blood pressure has ranged between
70/45-90/56 over the last 12 hours with a normal baseline SBP in
the 100's. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further

Abdominal CT [**2125-1-2**]:
1. Mild wall thickening of the descending colon through rectum
and likely the
more proximal colon, most compatible with colitis. Mild
dilatation of the
transverse colon up to 5.5 cm, most compatible with colitis.
Etiologies are
more likely infectious than inflammatory. No definite evidence
of toxic
megacolon.
2. Left small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
3. New large amount of intra-abdominal fluid, which is likely
free flowing
however, underlying abscess formation cannot be entirely
excluded in the
setting of no IV contrast. Large amount of fluid within the
scrotum and
subcutaneous edema likely represents anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT [**2121**] complicated
by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis
obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence,
presented from [**Hospital **] Rehab with hypotension and diarrhea for a
few days. He was found to be in septic shock, requiring pressors
and broad spectrum antibiotics. Stool studies were positive for
Clostrodium difficile and imaging studies were consistent with
colitis. Patient required ventilatory support. Despite
aggressive fluid resuscitatioin, pressors, and antibiotics,
patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated with
multi-organ failure. After discussion among his family,
outpatient providers, and ICU team, the decision was made for
comfort measure only, and patient died on [**2125-1-8**].
