Pertinent Results:
========
GI
========
Colonoscopy Impression: Diverticulosis of the descending colon
and splenic flexure One of the diverticulum had evidence of clot
present. This one was located near the splenic flexure.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

EGD Impression: Erythema at the GE junction, question of
Barrett's esophagus. Erosions in the antrum and stomach body No
source of GI bleed found Otherwise normal EGD to second part of
the duodenum

========
RADIOLOGY
========
Bleeding Scan INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of
autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow
images and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were
obtained. A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show physiologic distribution of blood flow.
Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of gastrointenstinal
system bleed.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of GI bleed.
.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of infarction,
hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. The density values of the brain parenchyma are
within normal limits. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. The soft tissues and surrounding osseous structures
are not remarkable.
IMPRESSION: Normal study.

========
ECG
========

Atrial fibrillation with mean rate of 96. Compared to the
previous tracing
ST segment changes are less pronounced.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) GIB: Pt was admitted for BRPR. He has had a significant drop
in his hct from a baseline of 48 to 27.3  The pt had one more
bright red stool in the ED. NG lavage was negative. Pt receieved
7 U PRBC, 6 U FFP and Vitamin K. He was placed on an IV PPI.
Coumadin and Aspirin were held in the stting of a GIB.
Colonoscopy was significant for extensive diverticulosis with
the presence of clot. EGD was negative for bleeding, but
suspicious for Barrett's esophagus. The patient's Hct remained
stable in the low 30s and he was transferred to the medicine
floor. He had a normal stool before d/c and did not have any
further BRBPR.
.
2) Afib: Pt rate controlled at home on verapamil. This was
stopped in the setting of  GIB. Pt required some prn Lopressor
in the MICU for rate control. Once pt was hemodynamically stable
his Verapamil was restarted. The pt triggered soon after he was
sent to the Medicine floor for HR >140. ECG demonstrated A fib.
Pt required Lopressor IV 5 mg x 1. His verapamil was titrated up
to his home dose and he remained rate controlled, but he did not
remain rate controlled. His dose was increased to 180 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
he was rate controlled thereafter. In the setting of a GIB, the
patient's coumadin and aspirin were stopped. He was given an
appointment with his cardiologist to deci
