Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bedside debridement of ulcerations by plastic surgery team


History of Present Illness:
68M with h/o t4 paraplegia x 2yrs, felt [**3-13**] "inflammatory spinal
disease", with a chronic indwelling foley, sacral decubitus
ulcers, presents to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab after RN noted 1d of fever
(tmax 101.8).  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN caring for pt at rehab, pt noted some mild
abdominal discomfort (chronic), but otherwise denied any recent
symptoms of cough, n/v, constipation, rash.  Pt has been having
chronic diarrhea (x3/day, x2-3/night) for past 1yr, etiology
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 227**] persistent fevers x24hrs, pt was brought to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN BP prior to leaving rehab was 100/72.
.
Per pt, he notes chronic abdominal pain, "always there",
diffuse, sharp, sometimes awakening him from sleep, no relation
to food or BMs.  somewhat worse over the preceding 4 months, but
actually improving over the past few days.  At present, he
states his pain has completely resolved.   ROS otherwise
significant for +orthopnea, pt also notes nonproductive cough x
3 weeks, no flu sx (body aches, congestion, sore throat).  Pt
denies flut shot or pneumovax.  +sick contacts (lives in [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab).
.
Upon arrival in ED VS=100.4  100  87/51  12  95%RA.  UA was c/w
UTI, pt was started on vanco and zosyn, UCx and BCx sent.
sacral ulcers felt to be stage 4, no evidence of superinfection.
 BP initially responded to 3L IVF (99/53), however after 3rd
litre, BP down to 85/40, pt therefore received RIJ TLC, and
possibly an additional 1L IVF bolus, afterwhich BP improved to
115/70.  Pt was asymptomatic, mentating throughout without
specific complaints.
.
Pt also noted moderate abdominal tenderness.  CT ABD done which
showed no acute processes.  CXR unremarkable, EKG unremarkable
(old Q in III, ?mild ST changes V1).
.
Pt admitted to ICU for further monitoring given hypotension.
.

Past Medical History:
1. Inflammatory disease of the spinal cord of uncertain
etiology.  MRA [**10-16**] negative for vascular malformation.  Initial
CSF analysis showed elevated protein (82) without oligoclonal

neuromyelitis IgG negative, ESR 70, CRP 66.8.  Ultimately
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids (two
weeks of Solu-Medrol followed by a prednisone taper), and 5 days
of mannitol without improvement.  He is followed by neurology
for a dense paraplegia (T4) with neuropathic pain, restrictive
shoulder arthropathy, and a neurogenic bladder requiring a
chronic indwelling foley.

dressing

6. Two-vessel coronary artery disease s/p CABG 4-5 years ago
7. Systolic CHF (EF 25-30% on [**2-15**] TTE)
8. Repaired liver laceration
9. Chronic back pain
10. Vitiligo
11. Feeding tube
12. Depression
13. MRSA from sacral swab and sputum
14. Prior transient episodes of leg paralysis
15. Right frontal lobe brain lesion biopsied [**11-15**] and c/w
gliosis; resolved on repeat imaging
16. Abnormal visual evoked potentials

Social History:

countries) in the [**2068**].  He is retired from a job in the
maritime industry.  Divorced 24 years ago.  Three children.

CT ABD/Pelv [**2106-4-6**]:
1. Severe sacral and right ischial tuberosity decubitus ulcers.
2. No acute intra-abdominal inflammatory process.
3. Cholelithiasis.

CXR [**4-6**] Bedside frontal chest radiograph is compared to
[**2106-1-2**] and demonstrate clear lungs, normal pulmonary
vasculature, and no evidence for pleural effusions. The heart
and mediastinal contours, remarkable for tortuous aorta, are
stable. This patient is status post median sternotomy.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

EKGs: NSR, essentially unchanged from prior tracings

WBC scan;

IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged appearance of residual sacrum with
adjacent posterior
focal radiotracer uptake, again apparently within adjacent soft
tissues.
However, given the proximity of the uptake, bony involvement
with infection
cannot be excluded.
2. Similar sclerotic appearance of right lower ischium and
adjacent soft
tissue thickening. Although the CT appearance suggests chronic
osteomyelitis,
immediately adjacent radiotracer activity has resolved and the
bony abnormality
appears unchanged.
3. New cellulitis along the right lower buttock, at the
interface with the
thigh and inferior to the prior site of infection.
4. More extensive radiotracer uptake in the left lower buttock,
with fat
stranding on CT suggesting cellulitis. Although the soft tissue
abnormality
extends to the ischial tuberosity, there is no CT evidence of
bone destruction
or abnormal bony radiotracer uptake in this area.

[**2106-4-6**] 6:38 pm SWAB      Source: left ischial tuberosity.

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2106-4-10**]):
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered
from the
      site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococcus
      aureus and beta streptococcus).
      Susceptibility will be performed on P. aeruginosa and S.
aureus if
      sparse growth or greater.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
         Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**8-/2404**])
immediately if
         sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this
