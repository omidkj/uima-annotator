History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 year old portugese speaking male with recent L
MCA CVA 2 weeks ago (d/c to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2180-1-25**]), PNA (treated
with Unasyn/Zosyn last 2 days), hip fracture, osteomyelitis of
left hip, delerium, aphasia who was vomiting x 2 days,
shivering, depressed MS, hypoxic to 65, and he was transferred
to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 8**] vitals were
103.2, 148, 85/41 (all subsequent ones demonstrated HTN), 42,
83% - placed on nonrebreather with little improvement and was
found to be tachypneic with labored breathing and was intubated
(received versed, lidocaine, rocuronium).  Also received cipro
400 mg IV x 1, Vanc 1 g IV x 1, cefepime 2g IV x 1, 2L NS.
Noted to have facial movement and with history of left MCA
infarct 2 weeks prior patient had CT head which showed
hemorrhagic conversion of left MCA infarct.  No neurosurgery on
call at [**Hospital1 8**] and was therefore transferred for further
management.

Right IJ sepsis line placed, 3L NS administered, and ativan 1mg
given.  Transferred to ICU for further management.  Patient
intubated and unresponsive, unable to obtain further history
upon arrival.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2180-2-4**] OSH: RBBB, tachcardia, LAD, ST changes opposite
major deflection.
.
EKG [**2180-2-5**]: Sinus tachy, RBBB, nml axis
.
Radiology:
Head CT OSH [**2180-2-4**]: Acute to subacute infarct L temporal lobe
with interval development of parenchymal hemorrhage.
.
Head CT [**2180-2-5**]: Large left MCA ?fusiform? aneurysm without
definite evidence of rupture. Large left MCA territory subacute
infarction.
Overread:  Agree. MRI/MRA has been recommended to confirm that
the lesion is aneurysm and not other pathology such as mass or
unusual bleed CTA may also be helpful.
.
CXR at OSH [**2180-2-4**]: Bilobar PNA
.
CXR [**2180-2-5**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities, R>L (right middle
and lower, left lower), with vascular redistribution, deep
sulcus sign and hyperlucency in RUL
.
CT HEAD [**2180-2-10**]:
1.  No significant change in the appearance of the left MCA
territory subacute infarction with an 18 x 11 mm hyperdense
focus medially within the temporal lobe consistent with
hemorrhagic infarction.
2.  No evidence for midline shift or herniation.
.
EEG [**2180-2-11**]:
This is an abnormal EEG due to the frequent spike and wave
discharges, primarily from the left frontal region with spread
to the
left and right hemispheres independently. These discharges
suggest a
left frontal region of cortical irritability. The second
abnormality
suggests diffuse encephalopathy, which may be seen with
infections,
toxic metabolic abnormalities, medications and ischemia.
.
MRI/MRA [**2180-2-11**]:
1.  There are confluent areas of abnormal signal consistent with
the history of herpes encephalitis.  There is involvement of the
medial and lateral aspect of the left temporal lobe, the left
gyrus rectus, the left hippocampus, and both cingulate gyri.
2.  There is a stable nearly 2 cm hemorrhage at the anteromedial
aspect of left temporal lobe near the MCA and there is a stable
small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
3. There is good flow in the distal internal carotid arteries,
the distal vertebral arteries, and the basilar artery.  There is
mild distal asymmetry of the PCAs, which is commonly seen.
There is probably slight elevation of the left MCA by the
hemorrhage but no stenosis of it is seen. IMPRESSION:  There is
no significant stenosis of the left MCA from the adjacent
hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**2180-2-20**]: Worsening left lower two foci of consolidation
which might represent worsening infection or aspiration, with
otherwise unchanged appearance of the lungs.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old male who was transferred from an
outside hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
# Pneumonia and sepsis: the patient likely experienced an
aspiration event resulting in either aspiration pneumonia or
chemical pneumonitis and hypoxia. Upon transfer, the patient was
admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU. A CXR showed evidence of CHF
(iatrogenic due to fluid resuscitation) and possible PNA.  An
EKG showed RBBB and no concordant ST changes.  Cardiac enzymes
were negative for MI. He was intubated on the day of admission
and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. Mr. [**Known lastname **] qualified for
the sepsis protocol and was treated as such with mixed venous O2
monitoring, maintaining MAP > 65 (pressors), CVP 10-12 (fluids),
following UOP and high-dose steroids.
.
His MICU course was complicated by development of pansensitive
Klebsiella pneumonia that was treated with
Meropenem/Vancomycin/Flagyl. The patient's family decided that
they wanted the patient to be extubated despite RISB > 100. He
was subsequently transferred to the floor and oxygen requirement
weaned. The patient is being converted to oral antibiotic
coverage upon discharge with levofloxacin and will require 2
more days of treatment.
.
# Altered mental status: the patient had a recent history of
hemorrhagic stroke and HSV encephalitis. The patient was
continued on Acyclovir for HSV encephalitis for 21 day course
total.  The patient's SBPs were maintained between 100-140 in
setting of possible intracranial bleed.  Aspirin was held.  An
MRI was performed which showed similar findings to the previous
MRI.  Neuro recommended an additional month of Dilantin after
discharge and after a repeat EEG.
.
# Seizure history: the patient had a known history of seizures
during his last hospital admission, and he was maintained on
dilantin.  His target therapeutic range is 15-20 as per
Neurology recommendations. The patient showed no evidence of
seizure activity during this hospitalization.
.
# Thrombocytosis: the patient's platelet count reached 1100
during this admission and it was thought to be related to
