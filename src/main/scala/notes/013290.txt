Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
arterial line

History of Present Illness:
87 y/o Cantonese M with PMHx of CHF, Atrial Fib, Metastatic
Prostate Ca with recent PNA who was discharged to NH from [**Hospital 3278**]
medical after a CHF exacerbation ([**Date range (1) 25250**])and now being
brought in by EMS with worsening shortness of breath. Pt was
felt to be in CHF by EMS providers and was given SL nitro and IV
lasix en route.
.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was in respiratory distress on a NRB
with sats of 83%. He was immediately placed on CPAP the next set
of vitals: P 80 BP 137/49 RR 34 O2 99% sat on CPAP of [**4-6**] with
100%. EKG did not show any acute ST-T wave changes and CXR
showed at LLL infiltrate with possible effusion. Pt was given
Levofloxacin 750mg IV, Ceftriaxone 1gram and Azithromycin 500mg
IV. Pt was given IVF at 250cc/hr with a total of approx 500cc.
Notes from [**Location (un) **] Health documenting clear DNR/DNI status.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was on CPAP and after transition to
high flow mask, he was notably more tachypneic.


Past Medical History:
-Rapidly progressive, treatment resistance prostate cancer
(started on Lupron '[**83**], Casodex added [**11-7**]
-Diastolic Heart Failure with EF of 55%
-h/o Urinary Retention (now s/p foley)
-Atrial Fibrillation
-Recent hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 30801**]/10) with Sepsis thought due to
PNA, managed with pressors but remained DNR/DNI. Pt was
re-admitted 10 days later with presumed CHF exacerbation,
diuresed and discharged to NH on [**5-18**].


Social History:
Pt was discharged from [**Hospital 3278**] Medical to [**Location (un) **] health NH on
[**5-18**]. Pt has a 60 pack year history of smoking. No ETOH or drug
use.

Pertinent Results:
TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>65%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation with
normal valve morphology.

CXR
There is opacity in the left mid and lower lung concerning for
aspiration or pneumonia with associated pleural effusion.
Blunting of the
right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small pleural
effusion. No
pneumothorax is seen. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o M with PMHx of CHF, AF, Metastatic Prostate Ca and recent
OSH admission with PNA/sepsis/CHF who presents with respiratory
distress, LLL infiltrate and acute renal failure.
.
#. Respiratory Distress: Pt with recent admission with
sepsis/PNA followed by an admission for CHF who p/w tachypnea,
hypoxia and dense LLL infiltrate. Pt placed on BiPAP with
improvement in sats and decreased distress. After long
discussion with family/patient, DNR/DNI status confirmed.
Family/patient understand gravity of situation and additional
family being notified. Patient with hypoxia and tachypnea in the
setting of metabolic acidosis.  Was treated broadly with
