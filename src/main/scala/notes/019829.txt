Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck discomfort.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Fiberoptic endoscopy [**2138-6-5**].


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62275**] is a 48 year-old male with PMH significant for
GERD and asthma, status post left shoulder AC joint
reconstruction by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62276**] on the day of admission. He was
discharged from the PACU after an uncomplicated surgery.

Per discussion with anesthesia, intubation was not complicated
but placement of the OG tube required force. At home, Mr.
[**Known lastname 62275**] reported that he felt sinus congestion and fullness in
his in right ear. He then pinched his nose and did a valsalva
maneuver to clear the congestion. Seconds later, he found that
his right neck, cheek and periauricular area puffed out with
air. He subsequently presented to the pre-op holding area, where
a STAT CXR and neck X-ray showed pneumomediastinum and SQ
empyshema in neck, no pleural effusion.

ENT was consulted. A fiberoptic scope did not demonstrate
air/damage in upper pharynx. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
closer monitoring. Of note, he says the swelling is actually
getting better.

Past Medical History:
Exercise-induced asthma
Status post left shoulder reconstruction for AC separation
Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Social History:
He denies tobacco or EtOH intake.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

LACTATE-3.7*

Relevant imaging data:
[**2138-6-5**] CXR: Lucency along the left cardiac silhouette and
along the left trachea represents mediastinal air. There is no
evidence for PTX, though the upper most apices are not imaged.
The left costophrenic angle is not imaged. The lungs are clear
given these limitations, the pleurae are normal. The heart is
top normal. The mediastinal contours are normal besides presence
of mediastinal emphysema.

[**2138-6-5**] NECK X-RAY: Moderate subcutaneous emphysema is seen
tracking within the soft tissues of the neck. Lung apices are
unremarkable.

[**2138-6-5**] CT NECK: There is extensive pneumomediastinum extending
into the
parapharyngeal spaces as well as subcutaneous soft tissues of
the neck.  There is no definite evidence of disruption of the
trachea or esophagus.  Oral contrast is noted in the esophagus
and there is no extravasation of oral contrast into the
mediastinum.  On lung windows, there is minimal atelectasis in
the LLL.

[**2138-6-6**] CXR: There is persistent mediastinal emphysema
extending into the soft tissues of the neck bilaterally. No
definite pneumothorax. The lungs remain clear and there are no
definite pleural effusions in this single view.

[**2138-6-7**] CXR: Single portable radiograph of the chest again
demonstrates air within the superior mediastinum and soft
tissues of the neck.  The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.
The hila are unremarkable. The lungs are clear. Trachea is
midline.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year-old male with a history of asthma, status post
uncomplicated left AC joint reconstruction, presenting with
subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum following a
Valsalva maneuver. His brief hospital course will be reviewed by
problems.

1) Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum: As noted above,
a CXR and neck X-ray were remarkable for subcutaneous emphysema
and pneumomediastinum. A CT neck was subsequently obtained which
confirmed the above findings. No definite evidence for tracheal
injury was found (although not fully excluded by CT), and there
was no evidence of contrast extravasation from the esophagus. As
noted above, ENT was consulted, and a fiberoptic endoscopy
showed a normal pharynx/larynx. Thoracic surgery was consulted,
with recommendation to manage conservatively. Serial CXRs showed
stable findings, and Mr. [**Known lastname 62275**] remained clinically stable.
He was placed on empiric antibiotic coverage with Clindamycin,
initially IV then oral. A mouth care regimen was also initiated
with chlorhexidine and nystatin, and he was placed on stool
softeners to prevent straining.

Given radiographic stability and clinical improvement, he was
discharged home directly from the ICU on hospital day #3. He
will complete a 7-day course of Clindamycin as an out-patient
(last doses on [**2138-6-12**]). He was instructed to use his mouthcare
regimen, and stool softeners, and emphasis was placed on
avoidance of lifting or straining. He will contact Dr.[**Name2 (NI) 1816**]
office on Monday [**6-9**] and schedule a follow-up appointment to
be seen in [**6-23**] days.

2) Status post left shoulder AC reconstruction: He was followed
by the Orthopedics service while in the hospital. His left arm
was kept in a sling, non weight bearing. Pain control was
achieved with Percocet as needed. He has a scheduled follow-up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2719**] on [**2138-6-18**].
