Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 88 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2121**],
CHF (EF: 25%), DM2, HTN, HL, a-fib who presents with dyspnea.
.
The patient was in his normal state of health until today when
he complaned of SOB. He was at rehab and was given a neb, but
continued to have worsening dyspnea. He denied any fevers,
chills, cough, sputum, or abdominal pain, EMS was called to take
the patient to the ED and O2 sats were in the high 80's per EMS.
In the ED he was placed on NRB with initial vital signs 97.1
HR:64 BP:142/81 RR:36 O2:99%. He was then placed on BiPAP and
vitals signs improved to HR:63 BP:120/64 RR:20 O2:100%. Labs
were significant for a BNP: [**Numeric Identifier 8068**], trop:0.04, CK:36, WBC: 15.5,
lactate 2.4 creatinine 1.4. The CXR showed mild vascular
congestion, large left pleural effusion and ?opacity in the left
base, likely atelectasis. He was given Vanco/levoflox/CTX for
presumed pneumonia and albuterol/ipratropium nebs. He only
received 150ml IVF and no lasix.
.
In the ICU the patient was continued on bipap and comfortable.
He denied any fevers, chills, cough. He did report improved SOB.

.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

ECHO ([**2135-1-20**])
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive severe inferior
and posterior wall hypokinesis/akinesis, apical dyskinesis, and
hypokinesis of all other segments with relatively preserved
function of the basal segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2135-1-21**])
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Worsened, now
large left
pleural effusion and left basilar opacification with component
of atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.
Read in conjunction with CT examination from [**2128**] which
demonstrated concern possible left lower lobe lung mass, current
radiograph is insensitive for confirmation, and correlation with
interval imaging or a repeat CT examination can be performed as
appropriate.

[**2135-1-22**] CXR: FINDINGS As compared to the previous radiograph,
the pre-existing basal opacity has completely cleared. The left
basal opacity, however, is more dense than on the previous
examination. There seems to be an element of volume loss,
leading to slight displacement of the heart towards the left.
The presence of a left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The
cardiac silhouette is of unchanged size. Unchanged position of
sternal wires and pacemaker leads.


Brief Hospital Course:
Please see attending d/c letter for further details: below is
summary by resident:
.
.
This is a 88 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2121**],
CHF (EF: 25%), DM2, HTN, HL, a-fib who presents with dyspnea.
.
#. ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE / DYSPNES: Pt with extensive
cardiac history and last EF 25% likely secondary to ischemia.
The patient has a markedly elevated BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8068**] (prior value
~5000). Given his extensive cardiac history most likely etiology
is CHF exacerbation, and during admission able to elucidate
recent discontinuation of metolazone and drastic dose reductions
in home furosemide, carvedilol and ACE-I. CXR showed large left
pleural effusion and atelectasis vs consolidation in the left
base. He does have leukcytosis and elevated lactate and received
vanco/levo/CTX while more data was obtained, however all
cultures remained negative and urine legionella antigen was
negative; no leukocytosis or fever was observed. Patient was
given BIPAP initially and diuresed gently to avoid acute kidney
injury. Able to transition to supplemental oxygen without
difficulty in MICU and patient was transferred to the floor for
further management of his CHF exacerbation. Antibiotics were
discontinued with exception of azithromycin (5 day course).  He
did well on the floor, tolerated physical therapy.  He was
continually diuresed and improved in O2 requirement.  He was
discharged i
