Brief Hospital Course:
After the patient was stabilized a CT scan was obtained which
showedno signs of ischemic bowel a distended GB with no signs of
cholecytitis. Vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl were given and due to
the amount of abdominal tenderness, elevated lactate, and spetic
physiology it was decided to take the patient to the operating
room.  An exploratory laparotomy was performed and a large
amount of pus in the abdomen was found.  There was no
perforation or ischemia or any bowel.  The abdomen was left
open.

The remainder of the hosptial course is listed below by systems.
1. Neuro- Initially propofol and fentanyl gtts were used for
sedation.  As she began to wake up, she required minimal amounts
of morphine for pain control
2.CV-Initially a Swan-Ganz catheter was in place and levophed
was used to blood pressure support.  Gradually the pressor was
weaned and the Swan was removed. Patient was started on
Lopressor when she was able to tolerate it.
3.Pulm-Initially lung protective ventilation was used.  Vent was
weaned  to CPAP.  Trach collar trials were done for
approximately 4 hours a day the week prior to discharge.
4.GI-promote with fiber tube feeds (full strength) were advanced
to a goal of 70 cc/hr.
5.GU-The initial acidosis and renal failure responded to volume
resuscitation.  The patient was up in weight by about 15
kilograms and aggressive diuresis was used to help return the
patient to her dry weight.
6.Heme-Occasional transfusion of PRBC were given, however a
hematocrit of around 25 was tolerated.  A HIT antibody test was
negative.
7.ID-Patient was on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  The OR culture grew
VRE, therefore she was treated for 2 weeks with Linazolid.
Zosyn was continued for Pseudomonas in her sputum.  She also
received a course of acyclovir for severe herpes of her lips.
The open abdomen was closed in the OR on [**2131-10-22**].  Her temp and
WBC were elevated for 2 days, however these improved upon
evacation of a wound hematoma.  A vac dressing was placed on the
wound.
8.Prophylaxis-prevacid, sc heparin
9.PICC line in place.
