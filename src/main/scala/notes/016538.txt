History of Present Illness:
(HPI per admitting surgery service)

OSH transfer from LGH. No d/c summary sent with patient.

51 yo male with DM, HTN, gastric cancer, stage 3C colorectal ca
dx [**2105**] with extensive serosal and nodal disease at
presentation. He underwent resection with colostomy. He
underwent chemo + XRT with completion of all treatments 1 year
ago. He then had reversal of the colostomy and at that point was
considered to be free of his disease but with significant risk
given the the amount of disease when he presented. He had a
recurrance this past year with mets to peritoneum. He presented
to an OSH on [**2107-12-18**] with constipation an nausea amd
constipation, emesis. He also had persistent LH which began
after hernia repair in [**2107**] and at this time it was found that
his cancer had recurred. With standing/exercise/and using the BR
he is light headed and feels week. + SOB. No CP.+ Subjective
chills but no fevers.

He was admitted to the OSH from [**2107-12-7**] to [**2107-12-14**] for a ?
of SBO which did not require surgical intervention. He was
treated conservatively with IVF, laxatives and eventually
improved. He was discharged to home. He continues to take
narcotics with fentanyl, percocet, and did not keep taking the
laxative. His abdominal CT on presentation demonstrated a slight
increase in ascites, persistent small bowel dilatation and
transition to decompressed bowel near the prior ventral incision
area. Possible peritoneal implant seen. This was similar to his
chest CT a few weeks prior. His oncologist thought that his sx
were secondary to constipation and not frank mechanical
obstruction. He was treated with an NGT -> suction, IVF, NPO
with plans to start chemotherapy and an agressive bowel regimen.


Thoracentesis performed on L lung on [**12-25**]. Last thoracentesis
[**2108-1-1**]. CT chest negative for PE. P/w N/V, looking
obstructive, seen by [**Doctor First Name **], thought ileus. Non-operative.
Somewhat stable, cycles of N/V, constipation.  Somewhat tenuous.
 Not stable for chemo.  Pleural effusion, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 576**] x 2 with
reaccumulation within days. Feels SOB at rest. NGT last removed
2 weeks ago with failed attempts to advance his diet despite
relief of constipation. In addition to abdominal pain he also
feels pressure as though 10 people are standing on his stomach.
Last episode of emesis was 2 days ago, green brown and smelly.
No blood.

Family requesting transfer, and they request second opionion
about CA treatment.  Talked about Pleurex with [**Name (NI) 16814**],
unclear if will do it.  Family wants second opinion about CA
treatment. He has not eaten for 18 days. Every time he eats he
has abdominal pain and he is afraid to eat.
