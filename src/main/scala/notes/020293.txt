Admission Date:  [**2192-11-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-11-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2120-6-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old
Chinese-only speaking male with a past medical history of
hypertension who had had chest pain/burning for one week.  He
saw his primary care physician three days prior to admission
and was given a prescription for Cardura and Amoxicillin
(also had a cough at that time).  The chest pain did not go
away, and early on the day of admission the patient was seen
in Dr.[**Name (NI) 21923**] office where EKG revealed ST segment
changes.

Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital6 649**], where his EKG showed anterior Q-waves with
residual ST elevations in V1 through V3.  He was taken
directly to Cardiac Catheterization which revealed severe
three-vessel disease including total occlusion of the middle
left anterior descending.  Cardiac Surgery was consulted, and
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cardura recently started by his primary care physician.
2.  Zestril recently started by his primary care physician.
3.  Procardia recently started by his primary care physician.
4.  Protonix recently started by his primary care physician.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Distant tobacco use; quit four to five years
ago; was smoking one pack per day times 40 years.  No
alcohol.  No drug use.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, blood pressure
144/82, pulse 86, 100% on room air.  General:  Thin male; in
no acute distress.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
Elevated JVP.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Abdomen is benign; no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Good
dorsalis pedis pulses; no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.8, hematocrit
28.7, platelets 349, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0, CK 201, ALT 18,
AST 53, total bilirubin 1.2, albumin 3.5.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly; no acute cardiopulmonary
process.

Cardiac catheterization hemodynamics:  Pulmonary artery of
33/10/17, wedge of [**9-13**]/8, SVR 1168, cardiac output 6.3/3.6,
ejection fraction 51%.  There was 70% discrete stenosis of
the posterior descending artery, 60% stenosis of the left
main, 99% mid left anterior descending, 70% distal
circumflex.

EKG:  ST elevations in V1 through V3, rate at 70.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Patient with three-vessel disease seen
by catheterization was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass
graft however was delayed due to a fever.  Patient's CKs
peaked at 497, but his MBs remained flat.

Patient had recurrent chest pain despite being on the
intra-aortic balloon pump.  He was started on a nitro drip in
addition to beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor, aspirin, Heparin drip, and statin.  It was felt
patient needed to be revascularized and, due to his fever
Cardiothoracic Surgery was hesitant to take him for a CABG.
Patient was therefore taken back to the Catheterization Lab,
where he received a stent to the left anterior descending to
the left circumflex.  Patient tolerated procedure well.

On hospital day four the intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed.  Patient remained chest pain free.  Patient was
maintained on a medical regimen of aspirin, Lipitor, Plavix,
Lopressor, and Lisinopril.  He was to follow up with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12167**].  Patient's ejection fraction was
preserved at around 50%.

2.  Fever:  Patient was febrile throughout his hospital stay.
There was no clear source for this fever.  He was treated
with five-day course of Levaquin for a possible urinary tract
infection and was placed on droplet precautions for concern
over possible flu.  By the time of discharge there was no
clear source for patient's fever, but all culture data was
negative and was felt to be either a urinary tract infection
or a viral syndrome.  Patient was afebrile at time of
discharge.

3.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  On hospital day number three
patient had episode of melena.  He received one unit of
packed red blood cells.  This occurred in the setting or
Integrilin.  Integrilin was stopped, and patient was
transfused with a goal greater than 30.  Gastroenterology was
consulted.  They recommended an outpatient endoscopy.
Patient was continued on Protonix and had no further episodes
of melena off the Integrilin, and his hematocrit remained
stable.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged with plans for Gastroenterology
follow up.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Anterior acute myocardial infarction.
2.  Fever of unknown source.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Follow up with his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12167**].
2.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Gastroenterology for an
endoscopy within six weeks.

MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Cardiac
catheterization.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 once a day.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg once a day.
3.  Plavix 75 mg once a day.
4.  Lopressor 50 mg twice a day.
5.  Lisinopril 10 mg once a day.
6.  Levaquin 500 mg once a day times two days.
7.  Protonix 40 mg once a day.
