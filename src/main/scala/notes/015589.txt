Chief Complaint:
fatigue/melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
66 male with h/o hemochromatosis with cirrhosis no h/o varices,
pulmonary fibrosis on chronic steroids and intermittent home
oxygen transfered from OSH with melena and anemia. Pt noted
feeling dizzy and weak for several days, + black stool/diarrhea
for several days. Notes that for the past two days he was using
his 02 more, usually only uses 4L NC at night. Had been using
during the day to the point where he was unable to walk to
bathroom without becoming SOB. Very fatigued and weak. Presented
to OSH, had guaiac + stool. BP 80s (pt and family insist that
pt's BPs are normally in 80s-90s), got 2 U prbcs there and 2
units PRBCs in ED, getting 2 units FFP as well. Hct in ED 18
after 2U PRBCs at OSH, per report hct at [**Hospital1 **] 19. Baseline Hct
27 from our records. Seen by liver fellow in ED. NG lavage
revealed coffee grounds without BRB, cleared with ~200-300 cc
NS. Pt comfortable and mentating with BP still in 80s. Got
octreotide bolus now on gtt, got PPI. Per liver fellow, as
doesn't look like he is actively bleeding with plan to scope in
am.

VS in ED at time of transfer:86/37 86 100% 2L, had gotten 1.4L
NS in addition to blood. Had 2PIVs placed. Noted to have 800cc
of UOP during ED stay. Had blood cultures drawn as was noted to
be rigoring, although rectal temp 98.

On ROS, endorsed fatigue, SOB, weakness and "black water"
diarrhea x 2 days. Denied fevers, + chills in ed, no nausea or
vomiting. No CP or abdominal pain. Has chronic ascites but has
not noted any increased abdominal girth.

CXR [**2163-9-24**]
Again seen is slight prominence to interstitial markings in left
perihilar region, but these are unchanged. There is no focal
consolidation or effusion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
unchanged. The mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Stable chest x-ray with no evidence for acute cardiopulmonary
disease.
--------------
EKG [**2163-9-25**]
Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature complexes
First degree A-V delay
Left atrial abnormality
Left anterior fascicular block
Low precordial lead QRS voltages
Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities
Findings are nonspecific
Since previous tracing of [**2163-9-24**], sinus tachycardia present,
ventricular
ectopy seen and ST-T wave changes increased

Abdominal ultrasound
IMPRESSION:

1. Heterogeneous predominantly hyperechoic liver parenchyma that
may relate to underlying hemachromatosis. More severe forms of
liver disease including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be
excluded by ultrasound. Patent vasculature. Trace free fluid.

2. Nonobstructing left renal calculi. Probable upper pole left
renal cyst.

3. Splenomegaly.
----------------

The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). Left
