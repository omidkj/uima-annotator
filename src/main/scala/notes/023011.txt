IMAGING:
NCHCT [**3-26**] - FINDINGS:  High-density material is seen tracking
along the left hemisphere consistent with acute subdural
hematoma.  High-density material also seen tracking along the
falx and left tentorium, also consistent with subdural hematoma.
 Hematoma measures approximately 1 cm in greatest width and
demonstrates mass effect, with subfalcine herniation, with
rightward shift of approximately 6 mm.  Mass effect is seen on
the left lateral ventricle.  The posterior aspect of the left
lateral ventricle is not well visualized.  Left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is
also not well seen.  Evidence of previous right MCA territory
infarct again seen.  Dentate nucleus calcifications also again
noted. Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
IMPRESSION:  Left-sided subdural hematoma, with subfalcine
herniation with
rightward shift of approximately 6 mm.  Mass effect also seen on
the left
lateral ventricle.
.
CT C spine [**3-26**] - 1.  No evidence of acute fracture or
dislocation.
2.  Stable appearance to extensive degenerative disease and
vertebral body/ right facet fusion from C5-C7.
3.  Reidentification of extensive subdural hematoma.  Please
consult CT
examination report from same date for further details.
.
Shoulder x-ray [**3-26**] - No evidence of acute fracture or
dislocation.
.
NCHCT [**3-27**] - Large left-sided acute subdural hemorrhage which
appears to be unaltered in extent compared to the prior study of
[**3-26**]
.
CXR [**3-28**] - 1.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity is concerning for
ongoing pneumonia. 2.  Superior mediastinal prominence is
consistent with goiter seen on prior chest CT.
.
NCHCT [**3-29**] - Little change seen from prior study.  Again seen is
large left subdural hematoma.  There is no significant change
seen in the mass effect, or right temporal hyperdensity.
Calcifications are again noted in the folia of the cerebellar
hemispheres.  No new hemorrhage identified.
.
CTA chest [**3-29**] - 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus or
thoracic aortic dissection.
2.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities, concerning for pneumonia.
Small right
pleural effusion.
3.  Mild CHF.
4.  Stable mediastinal mass, likely representing goiter.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Name13 (STitle) **] was admitted to the ICU for frequent neurological
examinations and blood pressure control.  She had repeat head
CTs which showed no evidence of new hemorrhage. She was ruled
out for an MI.  On [**3-28**] she was transferred to the surgical
floor her Dilantin level was low and she was rebolused with
Dilantin and became quite lethargic. A repeat CT showed no
change or evidence of new stroke, however she was noticed to
have some expressive aphasia which continued into [**3-28**],
otherwise her exam was fairly intact. An MRI was ordered to eval
for new stroke but on transport, patient became hypotensive and
was returned to the floor and evaluated by MICU team for
transfer.
.
S/p MICU transfer:
# Respiratory distress: Thought to be secondary pneumonia seen
on CT. Given fever, tachypnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, was treated
for pneumonia. [**Month (only) 116**] be community-acquired (as had been going on
since prior to admission) vs aspiration (with altered mental
status) vs hospital acquired. Was treated as aspiration
pneumonia with levofloxacin and flagyl. No evidence of CHF on
exam or xray, and had actually been getting double her usual
lasix dose on the medical floor and appeared dry on exam. CTA
chest negative for pulmonary embolus. Upon transfer back to the
medical floor, the pt's oxygen requirement was weaned down to 2L
NC and she was sating in the upper 90s by the time of discharge.
She was discharged to complete a 10 day course of antibiotics at
rehab.
.
# SDH: Was maintained on dilantin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her dilantin level
was stable in the 10-15 range s/p her repeat dilantin load in
the SICU. Coumadin was held throughout hospital course. Per
neurosurgery, she will need to finish a 7 day course of dilantin
for seizure prophylaxis. Neurosurgery also cleared the pt to
restart coumadin in 4 weeks time with a NCHCT to be performed
once her INR is therapeutic again. Her PCP will decide as an
outpatient whether or not to resume her coumadin.
.
# Altered mental status: Etiology unclear. Possibilities
included medication effect (dilantin) vs. sepsis and pneumonia,
vs expanding SDH. Head CT unchanged.  Dilantin held. Treated
pneumonia as above. Culture data negative. Per neurosurgery,
restarted dilantin [**3-29**] at decreased frequency (100 [**Hospital1 **]). Upon
transfer to the floor, the pt was alert and oriented X 3 without
any deficits noted on neuro exam, including aphasia and
dysarthria. She remained AAO X 3 during her remaining hospital
course.
.
# AFib: Well rate controlled on atenolol prior to transfer to
MICU.  Home atenolol continued. Held coumadin given SDH.
.
# HTN: Continued atenolol as above.
.
# Neuropathic pain: Continued home regimen of neurontin.
