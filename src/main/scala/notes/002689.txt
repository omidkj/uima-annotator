Admission Date:  [**2153-12-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-12-21**]


Service:  A-Cove

IDENTIFICATION:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman who was
admitted to the A-Cove Internal Medicine Service after being
transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service.
The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2152-12-12**];
admitted to the A-Cove Service on [**2152-12-17**].  The
patient has a healthcare proxy named [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 31**]
(telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37695**]).  The attending physician
on the [**Name9 (PRE) 37696**] Service was Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   She came to us in the Internal
Medicine Service with atrial fibrillation and a lung mass.
This [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a history of cholelithiasis was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2153-12-12**], for endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography to remove a common bile duct stone.

The case was complicated by atrial fibrillation to the 160s.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit where she was rate controlled with intravenous Lopressor
and loaded with intravenous amiodarone.

On [**2153-12-14**], she was successfully cardioverted with
300 joules but subsequently went back into paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  On [**2153-12-15**], a chest x-ray was done to
rule out congestive heart failure as a cause, and a right
hilar mass was found.  Chest CT showed a large bihilar mass
invading into the right lung parenchyma and bilateral pleural
effusions which were very concerning small-cell lung cancer.
A long discussion was had with the patient and her family and
revealed that the patient was not interested in a treatment
of the lung cancer; and, therefore, she was not interested in
any further workup and converted to do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   (Past medical history is significant
for)
1.  Coronary artery disease with angina.
2.  Cholelithiasis.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  She has had an ovarian cyst excision.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications when transferred to our
unit were amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., levothyroxine 500 mcg p.o. q.d., and
lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.

CODE STATUS:  The patient is do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone on [**Hospital3 **].  She has a
niece and a son-in-law who are involved in her care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her physical
examination on admission revealed vital signs with
temperature of 98, heart rate 80 to 100 and irregular, blood
pressure 150 to 180/80 to 90, respiratory rate of 18, 94% on
4 liters.  The woman was overall a well-developed/poorly
nourished white female in no apparent distress, and she was
not responding to questions at the time of examination, being
very drowsy having just been given Ativan for agitation.  She
was anicteric.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  The
oropharynx was clear and moist.  She had no jugular venous
distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  Heart had a regular rate
and rhythm, first heart sound and second heart sound.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Distant heart sounds.  The chest
showed diffuse wet crackles bilaterally.  The abdomen was
nondistended, bowel sounds were positive, soft, and
nontender.  Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Her laboratory
values showed a white blood cell count of 8.4,
hematocrit 28.5, platelets 190, mean cell volume 89.  Her
SMA-7 revealed a sodium of 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.5,
glucose of 94.  Calcium 8.2, phosphorous 2.2, magnesium 1.7.
PT/INR was 1.1 with a PTT of 65.  The patient was transferred
to us on heparin which was discontinued.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on [**2153-12-17**],
revealed sinus tachycardia at 100, normal axis, normal
intervals, T wave flattening in I and F.  No V3 tracing.
Unchanged from [**2153-12-12**].

Chest x-ray on [**2153-12-15**], showed interstitial edema,
small bilateral effusions.

Chest CT on [**2153-12-15**], showed no filling defects;
however, right greater than left pleural effusion with
atelectasis, soft tissue mass bilateral hilar with subcarinal
extending into the right lung parenchyma obliterating the
bronchus intermedius, mild narrowing of right and left main
stem bronchi concerning for small-cell lung cancer.


HOSPITAL COURSE:   As mentioned, it was determined by the
patient and her family that the large lung mass would not be
worked up, and so the patient was no longer a followed for
this; a bronchoscopy which had originally been planned to be
done was done.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had new onset atrial
fibrillation.  She was loaded with amiodarone, and she was
eventually converted to sinus rhythm.  She was maintained on
amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., and she was on
metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. for rate control.

It was determined that anticoagulation would not be
beneficial because the lung cancer represented a bleeding
risk, so no further anticoagulation was done.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  From a congestive heart
failure perspective, the patient was volume overloaded in
congestive heart failure, which may have resulted in her
being in atrial fibrillation because atrial fibrillation
stopped on the medications and with the diuresis that was
achieved.  In fact, she was diuresed to the extent that her
blood pressure began to go down.  She was gradually given
hydration without recurrence of her atrial fibrillation.

After two days her telemetry was discontinued because the
patient was do not resuscitate/do not intubate, and no
intervention would necessarily have been done in any case
based on her current medication regimen.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was status post endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography for a 2-cm common bile
duct stone.  She was doing well.  Liver function tests were
beginning to normalize.  She was maintained on levofloxacin
for a 14-day course.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  From a hematologic perspective, she was
heparin and then this was discontinued, and her hematocrit
did not go below 25 so she was not transfused.

5.  PROPHYLAXIS:  For prophylaxis because of her
gastroesophageal reflux disease, she was given lansoprazole.

6.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Again, she was do not
resuscitate/do not intubate and it was determined that the
patient would be suitable for being transferred to the Bay
Point [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation facility at [**Hospital1 1474**] (which
will be done on Friday, planned for 1 p.m.), and she would
then hopefully be able to go back to her home and with some
degree of services depending on what was needed after her
rehabilitation stay.


MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. (through [**2153-12-26**]).
2.  Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.r. q.8h. p.r.n.

5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Senna 2 tablets p.o. q.h.s.
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. (and a taper will
eventually be needed, but not at this point, so she will be
maintained on 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.  She will have to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] who is her outpatient provider.  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1312**]

discontinued on metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cholelithiasis.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Coronary artery disease with stable angina.
