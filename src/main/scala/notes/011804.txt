Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Questionable graft infection.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old white
male with a known history of abdominal aortic repair,
cerebrovascular accident, dementia, alcohol excess who was
hospitalized [**2150-2-21**] at Cape Code Hospital for mental status
changes, anorexia and weakness (he had been seen in the
Emergency Room at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on the 13th for urinary
frequency and was treated for urinary tract infection).  His
cultures grew staph coag negative, 50,000 to 100,000, which
was sensitive to Nitrofurantoin and Vancomycin.  It was
resistant to Levofloxacin and Oxacillin.  CT of the abdomen
and pelvis were obtained at the same time.  Head CT was done,
which showed bilateral lacunar infarcts.  The patient's major
complaint is abdominal pain with diminishing appetite and
weight loss.  This has gone on for over one year.  His
appetite has significantly decreased since [**Holiday 1451**]
"thought of food makes me sick" the patient told his
daughter.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for fevers or chills,
claudication, deep venous thrombosis, chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath.  He does have a history of
cerebrovascular accident with residual left upper and lower
extremity weakness.  He denies any recurrent symptoms.  He
has had no bowel changes, melena, liver disease or bloody
stools recently.

He is now admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

2.  Status post tubulovillous adenoma of the colon.
3.  Status post adenocarcinoma of the colon with rectal

4.  Status post abdominal aortic repair in [**2144**].
5.  Status post left hip surgery in [**2144**].
6.  Status post left inguinal hernia repair.
7.  Colonoscopy in [**2149-3-29**] excisions of multiple
polyps.
8.  Left heart catheterization in [**2144**], which showed an
ejection fraction of 40 to 45% with inferior wall
hypokinesis.  The right coronary is still obstructed.  Left
main trunk showed 20%, left anterior descending coronary
artery showed 20%, circumflex system was not defined.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 98.5.  HEENT examination
was no lymphadenopathy, JVD or carotid bruits.  Lungs clear
to auscultation.  Heart was respiratory rate with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination was unremarkable, but
for diminished breath sounds.  Rectal examination showed good
tone, no masses and guaiac negative stool.  Peripheral
vascular examination shows feet warm without ulceration.
There were no femoral bruits.  The examination pulse carotids
were 2+ bilaterally, radial arteries were 2+ bilaterally,
femorals were 2+ bilaterally, popliteals were absent.  The
right dorsalis pedis was dopplerable signal.  The right
posterior tibial was absent.  The left dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial were sent both by palpation on doppler
signal.  Neurological examination oriented times three,
grossly intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular
Service.  He was placed on triple antibiotics.  Pan cultures
were obtained.  Noninvasives of the left leg were obtained,
which demonstrated superficial femoral artery tibial disease
and a patent aortobifemoral bypass graft.  Infectious disease
was consulted regarding current antibiotic management.
Gastrointestinal was consulted and considered upper endoscopy
for identification of any disease.  The CTA was done, which
showed a aortoenteric fistula at the third portion of the
jejunum.  General Surgery was consulted (Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**]
[**Name (STitle) 4869**]).  Total parenteral nutrition was instituted.  A PICC
line was placed.  Nutrition calculated his caloric needs to
1750 to 2050 calories, protein 70 to 90 grams protein per 24
hours.  The patient underwent on [**2150-3-2**] an axillary bifemoral
bypass.  He was transferred to the VICU for continued care.
On [**3-3**] the patient returned to surgery with excision of
aortic graft and a left femoral axillary exploration and
thrombectomy and a left profunda femoris thrombectomy.  The
patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit.  Intravenous
heparin was begun.  Serial enzymes were obtained, because the
patient's significant cardiac history, which demonstrated
troponin level initially 0.13.  Echocardiogram was done,
which showed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.  It was
difficult to determine whether any new wall motion
abnormalities.  Cardiology recommended aspirin, Lopressor,
beta-blockade for a goal 60 pulse and a map less then 80, ace
inhibitors.

The patient required continued ventilatory support and was
transferred to the CICU for continued care.  The patient had
an episodes of hypoxia on postoperative day two and one
requiring reintubation.  The chest x-ray showed right lower
lobe changes.  His J tubes were instituted on [**2150-3-5**].  The
patient had a prolonged extended course in the CICU.  The
patient was extubated on [**2150-3-11**].  He has had several
episodes of ventricular tachycardia one with seven beat and
one with a 17 beat.  On [**3-12**] gastrointestinal was consulted,
because of gastrointestinal bloody drainage from his tube.
He was transfused a unit of packed red blood cells.
Endoscopy showed a small hiatal hernia, normal
esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the third portion of the
duodenum with some blood in the stomach.  Intravenous heparin
drip was held.  On [**3-14**] the patient was finally extubated and
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
He underwent an upper gastrointestinal series via the G
tube, which demonstrated no leaks.  Physical therapy began to
work with the patient.  His diet was advanced as tolerated.
On [**2150-3-17**] EPS was requested to see the patient regarding his
recurrent ventricular tachycardia.  They felt that he would
require an AICD.  The pacemaker was functioning correctly
that the AICD could be done on an elective basis after the
patient has recovered from his current medical situation.

On [**2150-3-18**] the PICC line required tissue plasminogen
activator to maintain patency.  Case management was requested
to see the patient and began screening for rehab.  At the
time of discharge the patient was in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.

8.  Coumadin 5 mg q.d.

DIET:  The patient's diet was advanced to a regular diet on
[**3-17**].  The tube feedings were continued with Impact with

then 100.  Flush the tube with water 30 cc q 8 hours.
