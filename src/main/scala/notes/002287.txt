HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
interstitial lung disease (on home oxygen), end-stage renal
disease (on hemodialysis), and critical aortic stenosis who
came to the Emergency Department on [**8-28**] complaining
of increased shortness of breath for the past two weeks.

She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] and discharged home on [**8-14**] with similar
complaints.  At that time, she was diagnosed with fluid
overload and a questionable pneumonia.  She was treated with
three days of levofloxacin which was discontinued prematurely
secondary to the side effects of diarrhea.

Since her discharge, the patient continued with hemodialysis
three times per week at [**Hospital1 1474**] where she had been complaint
with hemodialysis sessions.  Her last hemodialysis was two
days prior to arrival when she had a hypertensive episode
during the [**Hospital1 2286**] (her blood pressure at that time was
unknown and the amount of fluid taken off was also unknown).

The daughter reports that the patient has had a history of
hypertension during hemodialysis in the past; more than six
months ago.  She has a history of poor compliance with fluid
restriction.  In addition to her shortness of breath, she
also complained of lightheadedness when changing position.

On the morning of admission, she sat up on the edge of her
bed and fell onto a soft carpet hitting her face.  She denied
loss of consciousness.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was positive for
dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
an occasional productive cough of yellow sputum, and
lightheadedness.  Review of systems was negative for chest
pain, diaphoresis, neck or arm pain, or dysuria (she has
oliguria).  Review of systems was also negative for fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, or weight loss.

In the Emergency Department, on [**8-28**], the patient was
seen by the Renal Service in consultation who felt she should
be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for two
liters of ultrafiltration.  It was thought she needed
Intensive Care Unit observation secondary to her history of
hypertension during hemodialysis.

In the Emergency Department, the team tried to get a head
computed tomography but the patient was unable to lay flat
secondary to her fluid overload.  However, the patient did
not show any neurologic changes at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday).
 2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 3.  Interstitial lung disease (on home oxygen with 2 liters
nasal cannula).
 4.  Compression fracture.
 5.  Aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2 and
a peak velocity of 70 mmHg.
 6.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 7.  History of pericardial effusion.
 8.  Depression.
 9.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm in [**2159**].
10.  Pulmonary artery hypertension; moderate.
11.  Echocardiogram on [**8-11**] revealed an ejection
fraction of 60%, 1+ aortic regurgitation, 2+ mitral
regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Renagel 800 mg by mouth three times per day
 2.  Prozac 20 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Fosamax 70 mg by mouth every Monday.
 4.  Serax 15 mg by mouth q.h.s.
 5.  Calcium carbonate 1500 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Albuterol as needed.
 8.  Calcitonin.
 9.  Atrovent.
10.  Dilaudid 2 mg to 4 mg by mouth q.4-6h. as needed.
11.  Prednisone taper from her last admission which was
discontinued on [**8-23**].

ALLERGIES:  CODEINE (leads to pruritus) and PERCOCET (leads
to nausea).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed her temperature was 97.8 degrees
Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 89, her blood pressure was
147/67, respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation
was 97% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  Generally, the patient
was an elderly woman in mild respiratory distress with the
head of the bed at 30 degrees, using accessory muscles.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear.  The mucous
membranes were dry.  On neck examination, the patient had
jugular venous distention up to her ears.  Lung examination
revealed she had rales bilaterally up to the her apices with
intermittent wheezes at the left upper lobe.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed the patient had a [**2-25**] harsh systolic
ejection murmur throughout her precordium which was heard
best at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the
neck.  A regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed she had 3+ lower extremity
edema up to the thighs.  Some pedal petechiae.  An
arteriovenous fistula in her left arm used for hemodialysis.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert and
oriented times three.  She moved all extremities.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed her white blood cell count was 7.3, her
hematocrit was 36.1, and her platelets were 152.  Her sodium
was 132, potassium was 5, chloride was 89, bicarbonate was
32, blood urea nitrogen was 31, creatinine was 4.3, and her
blood glucose was 116.  Initial creatine kinase was 14.
Troponin was 0.15.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was negative for
consolidations or effusions.  There was mild edema and
chronic idiopathic fibrotic changes.

Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm, right axis
deviation, normal intervals, with an old right bundle-branch
block pattern.  There were old T wave inversions in V1
through V3, and leads III and aVF.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring during ultrafiltration.

On [**8-28**], she had 2.3 liters taken off and she
symptomatically improved in terms of her shortness of breath.
Her lower extremity edema also resolved as well.  The
following day she had her regular hemodialysis; at which time
they took off 3 liters, and she continued to feel even better
than her baseline in terms of her breathing.

Her sodium did drop during her admission from 132 to 128.
She was kept on a 1-liter fluid restriction, and the plan was
to undergo one final hemodialysis prior to discharge this
afternoon; and hopefully her hyponatremia will correct.

2.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient has a long history of
interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  She was on 2 liters of oxygen at home, and she
remained on this regimen while in house, and her oxygen
saturations remained between 94% and 100%.  She felt
symptomatically improved following each hemodialysis session
and reported her breathing was better than her baseline.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient has a long history of
aortic stenosis and was seen by the Cardiology approximately
one year ago; at which time no intervention was felt to be
needed.

However, on a more recent echocardiogram this past [**Month (only) 216**] it
was found that she had severe aortic stenosis with an aortic
valve area of 0.6 cm2.

The Cardiology Service was consulted during this admission to
discuss possible treatment of her aortic stenosis, and it was
felt that due to her comorbidities any operative risks (in
terms of an aortic valve replacement) would be extremely high
and was not an option at this time.  They also discussed the
option of a valvuloplasty, which they felt would not be
beneficial in this case.

During this admission, she remained in a normal sinus rhythm.
After her initial hemodialysis, she showed no signs of heart
failure.  She did have a recent echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 216**]
which showed an ejection fraction of 60%.

She initially came in on atenolol 25 mg by mouth on
