all recollection of events preceeding ingestion; says last thing
she remembers is having one beer, watching family [**Male First Name (un) **], and
taking
excess medication.  She will not reveal precipitant for
ingestion.  She initially states "I wanted to fu***** die," said
she always wants to die, so she took unknown quantity of

did not want to die, she just wanted to sleep; cannot say if she
believed she was taking a lethal dose.  Notes now "I made a huge
mistake."  Endorses anger, shame, and guilt.  Says that her
outpt
treaters are not helping her and her mother caused her to be
bipolar b/c mo is bipolar.  Continued to be hostile using

Brief Hospital Course:
  The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit
after being medically cleared on the medical floor. [**Hospital 35972**]
medical floor she did require a short period of intubation for
respiratory distress related to her suicide attempt.
  The patient was initially noted to be hostile and
uncooperative while being seen by the consult service while on
the medical floor. When ready for transfer to psychiatry she was
noted to be calmer and signed in voluntarily.
  While on the floor the patient stated her life had turned
around and she was glad to be alive. She was especially glad
that all of her social support (father, boyfriend, and mother)
were coming together to help her. On questioning she stated that
this attempt on her life was an effort to draw her support
together rather than a true desire to die. It was repeatedly
emphasized that in her miguided attempt to reach out, she nearly
died. Throughout this stay however she continued to minimize,
repeating that "everything is totally different" and that she
would never make an attempt on her life again. We attempted to
temper the patients extreme and abrupt turnaround and were met
with a low frustration tolerance and irritability. The patients
insight is certainly impaired.
   Also during this stay, the patient made several statements
concerning for Axis II traits including idealizations of her
parents getting together and boyfriend moving back from the west
coast as a result of her suicide attempt. It should also be
noted that after 1 or 2 meetings she idealized her relationship
with the consulting psychiatry resident and was asking to
transfer her outpatient psychiatric care to him. She stated to
the team, "I feel empty all the time."
   In general her presentation was concerning for Axis II traits
on top of a major depression rather than a bipolar illness. Our
concern with her impulsivity and alcohol use was discussed with
the patient.
   On the second hospital day the patient was strongly in favor
of discharge, and the team felt that she was safe to return home
with close outpatient follow-up as she was not at imminent risk
for another attempt on her life. When presented with the option
of discharge plus a partial program vs. staying on the unit the
patient was angry and irritable as she felt a partial was not
necessary, but agreed to the partial program. On the day of
discharge a family meeting was held with the patient, her
father, her boyfriend, and the social worker. It was there
agreed that it would be safe for the patient to return home,
especially as her boyfriend would be staying with her and her
father remaining in [**Name (NI) 86**] for the short-term. Prior to
discharge appotiments were made for the patient with her PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 35973**], the [**Hospital1 1680**] Partial Program. In addition the
patient expressed interest in obtaining a therapist, and she
will be assigned one at her visit with her psychiatrist.
