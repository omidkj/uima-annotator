None


History of Present Illness:
56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
immunosuppression presented with 3 days of worsening dry cough
associated with shortness of breath and post-tussive N/V.  Last
night she missed some of her dialysis because of weakness and
SOB.  Today she presented to the ED for headache.  Of note, had
2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma this past week, seen by
pulmonologist who put her on symbicort. 3 days ago developed HA,
migraine with N/V. No CP but cough nonproductive.
.
In the ED, initial VS: VS 99.4 76 247/116 20 98% on 2L.CXR with
volume overload, pulm edema, LLL consolidation. Given
evo/vanc/ceftriaxone. Did not draw BCx. BP 200/100s. Started on
nitroprusside drip. Labetolol 20x2 dropped HR 60s. Renal will do
peritoneal dialysis tonight. On cellcept and prednisone. Put on
nitroprusside at 0.6mcg/hr. Given dilaudid for headache and it
has improved. EKG NSR 76 TWI in V1 old and TWF in lead III. CT
head negative. Dialysis fluid cultures pending. VS prior to
leaving ED 99 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 17151**]%2L. Renal was consulted for
urgent/emergent dialysis.
.
Currently, patient endorsed dyspnea that improved with an
albuterol inhaler. She reported that her labetolol was recently

Pertinent Results:
MICROBIOLOGY:
[**8-28**] Dialysis gram stain and cultures: negative
[**8-29**] Blood, urine, legionella cultures: negative
.
STUDIES:
[**8-3**] Echo The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**11-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2115-11-7**], the degree of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] appreciated
have slightly increased.

[**8-28**] CT head:  PFI negative
.
EKG: NSR at 80, NA, NI, no acute STTW changes, slight peaked Ts
in V2-V5
.
CXR: edema, L effusion vs infiltrate

Brief Hospital Course:
56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive
emergency.
.
# Hypertensive emergency: Manifested initially as pulmonary
edema.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Patient recently endorsed
lowering of labetalol dose after being diagnosed with asthma.
Also missed peritoneal dialysis due to dyspnea as well as
missing po anti-hypertensives due to nausea. In the ED,
labetalol was given by mouth.  In the ICU, pt was on
nitroprusside gtt and labetalol gtt.  The patient had difficult
to control blood pressurs and needed both IV drips to maintain
goal SBP in 150-160s.  Her nausea improved with better blood
pressure control, and her home oral anti-hypertensives were
re-introduced while labetalol and nitroprusside were weaned off.
 However, overnight on [**8-30**], her BPs increased again to SBP
180-200s and would need labetalol gtt with bolus IV labetalol
and hydralazine.  This was weaned off by the next morning with
increase of po medications. She was also started on lasix,
lisinopril, and her clonidine patch was increased.  Her
labetalol was also increased to TID dosing but could not be
increased further due to heart rate.  The patient was also
maintained on peritoneal dialysis while in the ICU.  Nephrology
also followed that patient during ICU stay. Cardiac enzymes were
cycled and ruled out for MI. The patient was transferred to the
floor, for further blood pressure managment. Her blood pressure
remained labile, so her daily furosemide and clonidine [**Month/Day (1) 4319**]
were increased, and aliskerin was added to her anti-hypertensive
regimen.

# Dyspnea: This was likely due to worsening pulmonary edema and
heart failure as CXR consistent with volume overload.  She did
miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] of her home lasix due to nausea to home and also
missed a PD se
