History of Present Illness:
72 year-old male with diastolic heart failure, AVR, AF on
coumadin, CAD, pulmonary hypertension, CHB s/p PPM, and severe
COPD admitted with weight gain, urinary retention, and fever.
Son at bedside provides majority of history. Famiy noted weight
up to be up by approximately 5lb yesterday morning (baseline
~148) - discussed with patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] recommended metolazone
2.5mg IV x1 with Lasix. Also, difficulty with Lasix
administration time - receiving 2 doses 5 hours apart rather
than every 12 hours over past 1 week. Patient with no salt diet,
and strict fluid restriction to 1.75 liter per day.
.
Over past day had increasing difficulty with urination.
Yesterday took [**7-16**] attempts at a time before he was able to
urinate, and then only small amounts. Also with fever to 100.8
this morning. Decreased PO intake today. Patient presented to ED
for further evaluation.
.
Of note, inpatient [**Date range (1) 43020**] with COPD exacerbation and acute
on chronic diastolic heart failure. Received
steroids/antibiotics; Lasix 120mg IV BID (continued at
discharge). Medication changes included adding prednisone taper,
azithromycin, and ipratropium.
.
In the ED, 100.7 63 99/44 16 97% 2L NC. Physical examination
notable for midline site without erythema; well-appearing male.
Sons at bedside. Laboratory data significant for creatinine 1.9,
hematocrit 36.4, WBC 7.9 with left shift, lactate 2.6; UA within
normal limits. Urine culture, blood culture x2 sent. CXR 2V with
with fluid overload, ?RLL pneumonia. EKG with v-paced, similar
to prior. Discussed with cardiology; troponin elevation likely
related urinary retention; recommend no intervention at this
time. Foley placed with 600cc 0> 1L output. Received Lasix 120mg
IV per home regimen, vancomycin IV, and levofloxacin IV. On
transfer to medicine service, 102.3, 117/66, 74, 20, 100% 2L.

.
[**11-4**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type
of prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**11-20**] Left shoulder and elbow X-ray:
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Limited shoulder motion after extubation
FINDINGS:
Four total images are obtained including the humerus and elbow.
There are
mild degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint and
glenohumeral
joint. No fracture is identified in the humerus. Within the
elbow, there are mild degenerative changes without fracture
noted.
.
[**11-21**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-20**],
there is again a tiny right apical pneumothorax. The overall
appearance of heart and lungs is essentially unchanged. The
nasogastric tube has been removed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Medical Floor Course [**Date range (1) 43021**]:

#. MRSA bacteremia:
Mr. [**Known lastname 43019**] was started on vancomycin and cefepime on arrival to
the floor [**10-24**]. Infectious source was considered [**Last Name (un) **] PNA vs.
sacral and LE ulcers.  He was found to have high grade MRSA
bacteremia with 6/6 positive blood cultures from the ED ([**10-23**],
19/18, and [**10-25**]).  ID was consulted and the midline was pulled
on hospital day 2 ([**10-25**]).  Daily blood cultures were drawn for
evidence of clearing of infection.  Bacteremia was thought to be
due to a transietn bacteremia likely from his sacral stage IV
decubitus ulcer or other cutaneous entry point, with the midline
serving as a nidus for rapid replication.  Pneumonia was
considered to be another, less likely source of bacteremia.  On
the evening of [**10-25**] cefepime was stopped due to low suspicion
for pneumonia and he was started on gentamycin at 0.5mg/kg ([**1-8**]
normal dose due to chronic kidney disease) for empiric
endocarditis treatment.  TEE was performed on [**10-27**] to look for
valvular vegetations and showed no vegetations, and left atrial
appendage thrombus could not be ruled out.  CT chest was
performed to look for evidence of pneumonia.  Given back and hip
pain, plain XRay of his hip was performed on admission and
showed no obvious fracture, though could not rule out fracture
of greater trochanter.  CT back and hip were performed [**10-26**] to
look for evidence of osteomyelitis or spinal cord compression
given urinary retention and bac
