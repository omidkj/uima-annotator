History of Present Illness:
 68 year old man with severe COPD (2L NC O2 dependent), ischemic
cardiomyopathy, LVEF 40%, CAD s/p unprotected LM stenting in
[**2168**] with DES (not surgical candidate), PVD s/p femoral bypass,
diabetes type 2 with diabetic neuropathy, s/p multiple
hospital/nursing home admissions over the past several months
for COPD exacerbations, CHF, pneumonia, NSTEMI and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cath.
.
Per patient and OSH records, he had worsening SOB for 5 weeks
ago with decreased activity tolerance and worsening dyspnea on
exertion.  At his local hospital in early [**Month (only) **], he was treat
for PNA and was noted to be in AFib.  He was started on coumadin
and then discharged to a nursing home for rehab.  From rehab, he
was readmitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23925**] Hospital in early [**Month (only) **] with
a COPD exacerbation. There his course was complicated by an
NSTEMI and was briefly intubated.  He survived the episode was
treated with Cipro for a presumed PNA and was sent to [**Hospital1 **]
again.
.
At [**Last Name (un) 8612**], he developed recurrent AFib and tachycardia for
which he was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2171-3-22**].  There
he was treated with sotalol and digoxin but had persistent
tachycardia so was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further
management.  He was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital3 **] and
placed on a cardizem gtt.  They considered amio but given the
COPD were hesitant to do this given the risk of amio pulmonary
toxicity.  He was given sotalol and then converted to sinus
rhythm.  A TTE revealed EF 45%.  Per cardiology consult his
sotalol was increased to 80mg [**Hospital1 **].  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac catheterization.  Coumadin was held in anticipation
of cardiac cath.
.
For his COPD and possible PNA he was started on rocephin and
azithromax on the day of transfer. He was started also on
prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation with plan to taper to
20mg on [**2171-3-27**].
.
Here at [**Hospital1 18**], he did well overnight. He was taken to cath lab
for diagnostic cath. Cath showed progressive LCx (ostial 80%
lesion involve origin of AV branch) and RCA (80% proximal
instent restenosis, 70% mid lesion, 70% distal lesion) disease.
PCI to RCA with DESx3. Post cath groin angio showed a small
perforation of fem-fem graft.  This was compressed with Femstop.
 He was transferred to CCU with Femstop in place for 3 hr till
bivalirudin worn off.  Femoral sheath left in place overnight.
Plan for holding heparin gtt for now, but continue ASA 325 mg
daily, plavix 75 mg daily x12mths.
.
When seen in ccu, he was in mild distress with pain at fem-stop,
he had dopplerable pulses throughout.

Cath report:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a
widely
patent stent with minimal proximal in-stent narrowing.  The LAD
had <50%
stenosis at mid-vessel.  The LCx had an 80% ostial stneosis
involving
the origin of a very small AV branch.  The RCA had 80% proximal
in-stent
restenosis with a 70% mid-vessel lesion and a 70% distal lesion.

2.  Femoral angiography demonstrated a very small perforation of
the
fem-fem bypass graft.
3.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic
systolic
arterial hypertension.
4. Successful PCI to RCA with DES.
5. Monitoring in CCU as above. Femoral sheath left in place
overnight.
6. Aspirin 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily for a minimum of 12
months.
.
Echo
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
