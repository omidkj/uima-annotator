History of Present Illness:
85yoW with h/o asthma, HTN, PVD, COPD, and MAT, recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**Date range (1) 96595**]/06 for sepsis in the setting
of pneumonia and UTI, and was also treated for decompensated
diastolic CHF, referred from [**Hospital **] Rehab for concern of
acute renal failure. She had been discharged on vancomycin and
meropenem, with course due to complete on [**2169-11-12**]. Today at
rehab her labs returned with a creatinine of 6.7 and [K+] 6.6.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS T 99.9 HR 107 BP 130/92 RR 16
97%on 2Lnc. In the ED patient's creatinine was at baseline 1.5,
however, she became acutely hypotensive with SBP in the 90s,
going as low as 80/37. She was also noted to have a T of 100.8R
and FS of 23 with lethargy. She was treated with 2 amps D50, 1L
NS iv fluids, and admitted. Lactate was not elevated. She was
also given levofloxacin 500mg iv x1. On presentation now she
denies having headache, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea,
diarrhea, or dysuria. She continues to have a non-productive
cough, which she has had since her illness developed. She does
not take anything by mouth and has had a PEG for 3-4months for
feeding and medication administration.

CXR PA and Lat [**2169-11-10**] Admission:
IMPRESSION: Partial interval clearing of known left lower lung
lobe consolidation.
.
LENIs [**2169-11-15**]: No evidence of DVT.
.
CXR [**11-13**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-12**]:
Mild pulmonary edema which is new. There is also recurrence of
consolidation at both lung bases which could be atelectasis or
increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusion, but raises
concern for pneumonia. Heart is partially obscured by elevated
left hemidiaphragm but does not appear grossly enlarged. Tip of
left PIC catheter projects over the junction of the
brachiocephalic veins. Rightward displacement of the trachea at
the level of the aortic arch is due to tortuous head and neck
vessels as demonstrated by the CT of the chest on [**10-30**].
.
Chest CT [**2169-11-16**]:
1. As previously mentioned there is limited assessment for hilar
mass due to absence of intravenous contrast. If there is a
contraindication to iodinated contrast, the MRI of the chest
should be considered or a gadolinium injection in conjunction
with chest CT.
2. Worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis and development of
new scattered nodules and small areas of consolidation is highly
suspicious for recurrent aspirations. Infectious etiology is
superimposed on the recurrent aspirations cannot be excluded.
3. Small amount of ascites, unchanged.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 85yoW with h/o COPD/Asthma, recurrent aspiration PNAs (s/p
g-tube placement), MAT, HTN, PVD, with recent admit for sepsis
in the setting of LLL pneumonia (MRSA by BAL) and UTI (resistant
pseudomonas), returned to hospital with hypoglycemia,
transferred to the ICU for recurrent episodes of hypoxemia,
likely secondary to mucous plugging/aspiration.
.
# Hypoxia: On the floor prior to MICU transfer, patient had 4
episodes over 72 hours of acute desaturation to 70-80's. During
these episodes she has become tachycardic to 120's and SBP has
dropped to 90's (diastolic CHF). She generally improves fairly
quickly to mid to upper 90's with supplemental oxygen (NC, face
mask, NRB). Triggers have included ?blood transfusion
(determined not to have been transfusion reaction) and pulmonary
toilet. These have occurred in the setting of intermittent low
grade fevers (99-101). EKGs are unchanged and LENIs negative
making ischemic or pulmonary embolis less likely.  Acute event
precipitating [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer likely [**12-29**] mucus plugging and/or
aspiration, on top of poor lung function at baseline from
aspiration PNA and LLL collapse. Sputum from [**11-20**] grew
Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn and MRSA and vanco, cipro, flagyl
changed to zosyn, vanco. Likely contribution of underlying
pneumonia.  She was stable on 40% high flow O2 for most of her
MICU stay with persistent intermittent desaturations to high 80s
with subjective SOB.  O2 sats improve with suctioning,
aggressive chest PT, nebulizers, and increase in FiO2. Following
improvement, she was quickly able to return to 40% O2. She was
quite deconditioned and was unable to clear her secretions which
was believed to have a significant contribution to
desaturations. Also possible contribution of volume overload and
was treated with diuresis. She was otherwise managed with
Advair, tiotropium, around the clock albuterol/atrovent nebs, as
well as prn albuterol nebs. She completed a 14 day course of
vancomycin on [**2169-11-30**].  Repeat sputum cultures showed rare GNRs.
She was continued on Zosyn to complete a 14 day course. She was
evaluated by Interventional Pulmonology for possible mini-trach
to aid in suctioning which the patient declined. However, her
oxygen requirement and secretions improved substantially. At the
time of discharge she had been stable on nasal cannula, had not
required deep suctioning in 3 days, and had no increased work of
breathing.
.
# Fever: Patient had low grade fevers since admission, without
leukocytosis or left shift. DDx was infection, atelectasis, and
much less likely malignancy. Possible sources of infection
included ?pna, candidal infection (oral thrush, groin
candidiasis and urinary yeast infection), PICC line infection,
