Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (status
post inferoposterolateral myocardial infarction in [**2179**]),
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus who was transferred from [**Hospital3 15175**] to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2183-6-6**] for a cardiac catheterization.

In [**2179**], the patient's cardiac catheterization revealed an
occluded right coronary artery and circumflex with
moderate-to-diffuse disease along the left anterior
descending artery.

The patient currently has presented with increasing shortness
of breath which awoke him from sleep; at which time the
patient presented to [**Hospital3 15174**] on [**2183-6-3**].  During the presentation, the patient's BNT was
elevated to 459, and the patient's Persantine thallium showed
an inferolateral defect; at which time the patient was
referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 188**] showed 60% to 70% ostial left main, left anterior
descending artery with 80% and 70% mid, left circumflex to
mid, right coronary artery to mid, both collateralized from
left.  Ejection fraction was in the high 40s.  There was the
presence of mild mitral regurgitation and inferobasal and
posterior akinesis.  Wedge was estimated to be approximately
17 mmHg.  No evidence of chest pain, and shortness of breath
was substantially better after treatment with Bumex.

At this time, the patient was evaluated by Cardiothoracic
Surgery Service for a coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction and
known 3-vessel disease in [**2179**].
2.  Ventricular tachycardia; status post implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator.
3.  Mitral regurgitation.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Status post a right carotid endarterectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications at home included)
1.  Wellbutrin 100 mg p.o. twice per day.
2.  Mavik 4 mg p.o. every day.
3.  Pravachol 40 mg p.o. once per day.
4.  Labetalol 200 mg p.o. twice per day.
5.  Reminyl 8 mg p.o. twice per day.
6.  Sotalol 160 mg p.o. twice per day.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (to which the patient develops hives).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a longstanding history of
pipe smoking and social alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
at the time of discharge revealed vital signs with a
temperature of 97.3, heart rate was 63 (sinus), blood
pressure was 177/90, respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen
saturation was 99% on room air.  The patient was a
well-developed and well-nourished male in no apparent
distress at the time of discharge.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
Mucous membranes were moist.  No evidence of oral ulcers.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No cervical
lymphadenopathy noted.  The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The staples were intact along the sternotomy
incision site, and no evidence of erythema or serosanguineous
drainage were noted.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  No clicks.  Abdominal
examination revealed positive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  No evidence of hernia noted, and no
inguinal lymphadenopathy noted.  There was no presence of
hepatosplenomegaly.  Lower extremity examination revealed
there was no evidence of edema noted in the lower
extremities, and the graft site showed no evidence of
erythema or serosanguineous drainage.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  Pertinent
laboratories on [**2183-6-17**] revealed white blood cell count
was 18.3, hematocrit was 26.7, and platelets were 424.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 4.8, chloride was 99,
bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 14, and
creatinine was 0.7.  Magnesium was 2.1 and calcium was 9.4.
Prothrombin time was 15.3, partial thromboplastin time was
57.2, and INR was 1.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a
59-year-old male status post inferoposterolateral myocardial
infarction in [**2179**] who, upon catheterization at that time,
revealed 100% right coronary artery, 100% mid left
circumflex, and mild-to-moderate diffuse left anterior
descending artery disease.

Subsequently, the patient was treated and medically managed.
However, the patient developed acute shortness of breath,
elevated BNT, and Persantine thallium demonstrated mixed
inferolateral defect with corresponding cardiac
catheterization revealing 60% to 70% left main disease, left
anterior descending artery with 80% disease, with an ejection
fraction in the high 40% range.

Given these findings, the patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service, and the patient was
successfully screened for coronary artery bypass graft.

On [**2183-6-9**], the patient underwent an uncomplicated
coronary artery bypass graft times five (with left internal
mammary artery to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to right
coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to second obtuse
marginal, saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal to
left anterior descending artery).

Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Recovery Unit for close monitoring and was promptly
extubated without difficulty.  The patient maintained good
oxygen saturations on 3 liters nasal cannula and maintained
good urine output after weaning off of pressors.

By postoperative day one, the patient was initiated on a
cardiac diet.  Electrophysiology was consulted for a check of
the permanent pacemaker.  Electrophysiology consultation
revealed that the parameters were in the acceptable range
with evidence of full energy charge in the implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator.

By postoperative day two, the patient again required a
moderate amount of Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support,
and the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation to which
the patient was initiated on an amiodarone drip.  At this
time, beta blockers were also increased, and the chest tube
was also removed.

By postoperative day four, the patient was completely weaned
off of pressors.  As the patient maintained good oxygen
saturations along with good pressures without further
support.  The decision was made to transfer the patient to
the floor.  At this time, the patient's amiodarone was
discontinued as the patient maintained a sinus rhythm, and
sotalol was re-initiated.

Given the history of the patient's intermittent atrial
fibrillation, the patient was initiated on heparin for
anticoagulation, and Coumadin was also administered.

By postoperative day seven, heparin anticoagulation was
therapeutic and the dosing of labetalol and sotalol were
staggered to reduce any provocation of orthostasis.
Immediately prior to initiating the full dosing of Lopressor,
the patient developed lightheadedness and alerted the staff
of feeling weak.  This event was evaluated and was determined
to be probable to the administration of both sotalol and
labetalol.  After consulting with Electrophysiology, the
decision was made to decrease the sotalol dosage to 120 mg
from 160 mg p.o. twice per day, and the staggering regimen of
Lopressor was maintained.  At this time, no further episodes
of lightheadedness were noted by the patient and the patient
achieved level V physical therapy status without difficulty.

Given the fact that the patient was doing so well, the
patient was discharged on [**2183-6-17**] with instructions to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Cardiology.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft (with left internal mammary artery to diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, saphenous vein
graft to second obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to
first obtuse marginal to left anterior descending artery).
