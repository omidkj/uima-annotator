RUQ U/S:Study Date of [**2106-7-16**]
IMPRESSION: 1.  Gallbladder sludge without evidence of
cholecystitis.
2.  Splenomegaly. 3.  Hyperechoic area in the left lobe of the
liver is also seen on the CT from the same day. Differential
includes old lymphomatous infiltration, area of greater fatty
infiltration, or possibly an unusual appearance of a benign
lesion such as an atypical hemangioma could be considered.
There has been no definite recent change although the lesion is
easier to visualize on this study.  If further characterization
is desired, then MR imaging may be useful.

CXR Chest: Study Date of [**2106-7-16**]
IMPRESSION:
Patchy new left mid and lower lung opacities, typical in
morphology for
atelectasis, although an infectious etiology is difficult to
completely
exclude based on the imaging.

CT Chest and Abdomen Study Date of [**2106-7-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Chronic pulmonary embolism with no evidence of new acute
pulmonary
embolism.
2.  Geographical distribution of a hypodense area in the left
lobe of the
kidney, also seen on the ultrasound of the same day.  While the
relative
degree of hypoenhancement is more striking on today's exam, the
etiology is uncertain.  This was not avid on recent PET scan.
Differential includes old lymphomatous infiltration with marked
atrophy involving the left lobe or atrophy of other etiology;
there may be relative fatty infiltration at the site and an
unusual benign lesion such as a hemangioma could also be
involved.
3.  Overall, extensive mediastinal, retroperitoneal, celiac and
pelvic
lymphadenopathy appears to be stable to slightly decreased in
size since the PET-CT from [**2106-3-28**].
4.  Splenomegaly.
5.  No acute intra-abdominal or intrathoracic process to explain
the patient's pain.
[**2106-7-22**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)
FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph there are now small
bilateral pleural effusions.  Left retrocardiac opacity likely
represents lower lobe pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar in appearance to the
prior radiograph.  Bony structures are intact.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions.
2.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents left lower lobe
pneumonia.

[**2106-7-23**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs are obtained.  Heart
is normal size and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Lungs do not demonstrate significant changes compared to the
prior radiograph.  Opacification of the left base represents
atelectasis or consolidation.  Persistent small right pleural
effusion with increased small left pleural effusion.  No
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Persistent small pleural effusions bilaterally.
2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation.

MICRO:
[**2106-7-19**] 4:19 pm Direct Antigen Test for Herpes Simplex Virus
Types 1 & 2
Negative for Herpes simplex by immunofluorescence.
[**2106-7-19**] 4:19 pm DIRECT ANTIGEN TEST FOR VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS
 DIRECT ANTIGEN TEST FOR VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS (Final
[**2106-7-20**]): POSITIVE FOR VARICELLA ZOSTER.
