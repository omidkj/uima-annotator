Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
66 year-old gentleman who initially presented on [**2174-5-22**] from an
outside hospital with a 3 day history of abdominal pain and one
day history of fever. The pt. was found to have acute hepatitis
and pancreatitis at the OSH. He quickly became hypotensive on
the floor with systolic blood pressures in the 60s. He was
started on pressors, as well as Unasyn and Flagyl for presumed
sepsis. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On
arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], he was started on levofloxacin and cefepime.
He was intubated and sedated on HD 1 for worsening mental status
and acidosis. He was found to be bacteremic with Klebsiella
pnuemoniae ([**5-24**]).

Past Medical History:
-HTN
-alcohol abuse
-pulmonic stenosis s/p bovine valve replacement in [**2127**]
-colon polyps s/p open excision

Social History:
Pt is retired and has a very large and supportive family.  His
daughter works on the board at [**Hospital1 18**].  He has a heavy etoh abuse
history but did not smoke.

Family History:
His sister has CAD, mother had breast cancer.

Physical Exam:
97.5 HR 108 BP 100/54 RR 26 %Sat 92 on 2L
Gen: Tired, jaundiced, slightly labored breathing
HEENT: Mild icterus bilateral, O/P dry
Neck: Supple, no cervical LAD, RIJ in place, could not assess
JVP due to RIJ dressing
Chest: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally
Cor: Tachy no rubs/m/g
Abd: Soft, Distended, tender to deep palpation, no rebound and
no guarding
Ext: cool, trace edema bilaterally, DP/PT pulses dopplerable
Neuro: A+O x 3, grossly non-focal. Garbled voice. No tremor.


Pertinent Results:
RUQ U/S:
1) Distended gallbladder, with pericholecystic edema and sludge.
Common bile duct is not dilated; there is no biliary ductal
dilatation. Findings may be consistent with acute cholecystitis,
in the appropriate clinical setting.
2) Incidental note of adenomyomatosis.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
1) Lack of appropriate contrast in spleen, concerning for
splenic infarction or low flow state .
2) Stenotic but patent celiac axis and superior mesenteric
artery.
3) Changes of chronic liver disease, with left lobe hypertrophy,
chronic portal vein thrombosis, extensive vascular
collateralization, and small- moderate amount of ascites.
4) Dilated gallbladder, with gallbladder wall edema, as seen on
ultrasound of [**2174-5-22**]. Gallbladder wall edema may be due to
ascites or third spacing of fluid.

Repeat RUQ U/S:
Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The
gallbladder is decompressed with cholecystostomy tube fitted in
the gallbladder fossa. The common duct is not dilated and
measures five millimeters.

Repeat Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT:
1) Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Nonspecific nodules
within bilateral lung bases, as described above.
2) Pigtail cholecytstostomy catheter in place, with tip in
gallbladder fossa. 4 mm stone remains in gallbladder neck.
3) Intraabdominal ascites, with no loculated, or drainable fluid
collections. No evidence of abscess formation. 2.9 x 1.4 cm
hypodense lesion within the interpolar right kidney with mild
enhancement possibly a hyperdense cyst, but not clearly
characterized on this study. Ultrasound may be helpful for
further evaluation.
4) Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5) Anasarca.

EEG:
This is a normal portable EEG. No lateralizing or
epileptiform abnormalities were seen.



Brief Hospital Course:
66y/o male with htn, etoh abuse, admitted with klebsiella
cholecystitis/sepsis, complicated by a altered mental status,
difficult vent wean, pancreatitis, ARF, and DIC.
Mr. [**Known lastname 61944**] came into the hospital with Klebsiella sepsis and
cholecystitis.  The initial management included starting at
first empiric antibiotics (then changed to meropenem once
sensitivities came back), intubation for hypoxic respiratory
failure, and a percutaneous gallbladder drain.  His initial ICU
course was marked by multiple problems, including persistent
hypotension requiring pressors, difficult vent wean, acute renal
failure from acute tubular necrosis, hepatitis, pancreatitis,
and DIC.  However, his hemodynamics improved to the point where
he maintained an adequate blood pressure off pressors and he
eventually self-extubated himself and did well.  He remained in
nearly anuric renal failure, dependent on hemodialysis, in DIC,
and had delirium.
Just prior to being called out to the general medicine floor,
blood cultures (drawn for a low grade temperature elevation)
came back with 4/4 bottles positive for gram positive cocci in
pairs and clusters.  His central and arterial lines were all
pulled, and he was empirically started and vancomycin.  He
remained hemodynamically stable and did not require pressors.
An surface and esophogeal echocardiograms failed to demonstrate
vegetations.  He did well for approximatelt 72 hours on the
floor when he had a blood bowel movement, became hypotensive,
and returned to the ICU.
There his hemodynamics were initially stable.  Concern for an
active GI bleed seemed incorrect as following stools were guaiac
negative and his hematocrit remained stable.  However, his
hemodynamic status began to decline and he was started on first
norepinephrine and then vasopressin drips to support his blood
pressure.  Follow-up blood cultures were negative, he had no
fever and but an increased WBC, ECG showed no changes.  As there
as concern for cholangitis/[**Last Name (LF) 61945**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MRCP was performed
that showed a non-distended GB and was otherwise fairly
unremarkable.  A U/S was performed to look for ascited and a
place to tap; the imaging showed moderate ascites, and a tap was
performed that was grossly bloody.  With concern for a possible
perforation, an abdominal CT was performed that showed extensive
bowel ischemia and splenic infarcts.
At this point, the patient's hemodynamic status continued to
decline and he was reintubated.  Discussions were held with the
family, who said that this course of treatment would not have
been consistent with the patient's wishes and that they wanted
to stop treatment and make him comfortable.  This was done and
the patient died soon thereafter.
