EGD

History of Present Illness:
52 yo male with PMH significant for alcoholism and hyperglycemia
presents from home via EMS for collapse. He has been binge
drinking for the last 2 weeks and felt nauseated and vomited
blood over the last 4 days. On arrival, EMS found him to be
naked on the floor. His initial blood pressure was 74/42 and he

ED course: Patient received 9 liters IVF and 2 units PRBCs.  One

return, unable to clear.  GI consulted, pt underwent EGD which
revealed, blood in the antrum and body, grade IV severe
esophagitis in the whole esophagus, congestion, erythema and
erosions in the whole stomach compatible with erosive gastritis.
Blood clot in the gastroesophageal junction, bleeding likely
secondary to esophagitis and M-W tear.  Patient also found to be

7.11.  Insulin drip was started, and fluids continued. He was
transferred to the MICU.

Currently the patient still has some nausea. He complains of
falls over the last few days. He also has had nausea and
vomiting with blood. He reports some nonproductive cough over
the last few days. He has abdominal pain. He complains of a

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-12**]: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Knee XR [**5-12**]: Normal alignment.  No fractures or joint effusion.
The joint spaces are preserved on this nonstanding view.
.
TTE [**5-20**]: 1. The LA is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. LV wall thicknesses are normal. The LV cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall LV
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging
demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal LV filling pressure.
 3. RV chamber size is normal. RV systolic function is normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.  No
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.  6.The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal.  7.There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
CDiff [**5-20**]: neg
urine cx [**5-21**]: neg
.
Abd US [**5-20**]: 1. No ascites.   2. Echogenic coarse hepatic
echotexture suggestive of intrinsic liver disease; however, the
portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow.  3. 2.8
x 2.7 x 1.7 cm cystic focus in the pancreatic head.  This could
represent a pseudocyst or cystic pancreatic neoplasm.  Further
evaluation with
contrast-enhanced MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is recommended.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**5-21**]: 1. Cystic lesion measuring 3.5 x 2.6 x 3.0
cm in the pancreatic head, confirming the finding on the recent
ultrasound and which has developed compared to the more remote
CT scan.  Note is made of _____ worrisome features identified.
The differential diagnosis could again include a pancreatic
pseudocyst, particularly given the background of chronic
pancreatitis, or a cystic pancreatic neoplasm.  If further
evaluation with EUS or MRI is not contemplated then followup
evaluation in three to six months would be recommended.
2. Small amount of nonspecific free fluid in the pelvis.
3. Changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis with development
of mild dilatation of the main pancreatic duct.
.
CXR [**5-21**]: Early left lower lobe pneumonia and effusion since
[**2191-5-12**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was scoped in the ED, found to have grade IV
esophagitis, possible [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI and
Sucralfate per GI recs.  His hematocrit was monitored for q 6
hours while he was initially kept NPO.  His diet was then
advanced to a regular diabetic diet, with his hct remaining
stable and no further evidence of bleeding.
.
He was continued on an insulin drip and IVF per DKA protocol in
the ICU.  Once his gap closed, he was transitioned to SC
insulin.  However, his gap redeveloped and he was placed back on
the insulin drip and IVF.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, thought that
his diabetes was most likely a combination of impaired
pancreatic function from ETOH abuse as well as a significant
component of an insulin resistance given the high amounts he was
requiring.  He was started on Lantus and Humalog sliding scale
once he gap closed for a second time.  On the floor his insulin
sliding scale was titrated by [**Last Name (un) **] consultants daily.  The
nurses dedicated much time to diabetes instruction.  The patient
had a difficult time grasping fingerstick monitoring and drawing
up his own insulin. He was hypoglycemic on the floor and was
changed over to pranding tid and this regmine worked well for
him.

For his ETOH abuse, he was closely monitored on a CIWA scale and
treated with Valium as needed.  Social work and addiction nurse
consults were placed to help provide the patient with resources
for treatment, as he was indicating that he would like to seek
rehab/detox.  Physical Therapy worked with him daily.  He is
being discharged to long term detox.

Given the significant amount of knee pain and his history of
falls, x-rays were obtained to rule out fractures.  The films
were negative, and he was given MS contin for pain relief.  His
elevated CK was thought to be secondary to his falls, and
trended down.  The morphine was stopped and the patient
tolerated this well.

Pancreatic mass - noted to have a small mass on abdominal
ultrasound and confirmed by CT scan.  GI service was reconsulted
and recommended repeat CT scan in [**7-14**] weeks.  Patient will also
follow up with GI after discharge.
