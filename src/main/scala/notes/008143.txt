HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male
status post Foley placement on [**5-9**] tolerating it well
initially, but was started on Cipro for prophylaxis for
urinary tract infection.  He developed pelvic pain and spasm

po intake.  He describes chills and increased confusion the
last day prior to admission.  He then developed hematuria.

A three-way Foley was placed and demonstrated blood clots,
and the bladder was irrigated.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a World War II concentration camp
survivor with a 100 pack year history.  He is a retired
dentist.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.4, blood pressure
160/61, heart rate 78, respiratory rate 19, and 100% on 2
liters.  Generally, he is in no acute distress.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Sclerae were anicteric. Mucous membranes
are dry.  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Had
decreased breath sounds bibasilarly, no wheezes.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended abdomen.  Extremities showed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  He had [**2-9**]+ bilateral lower
extremity, no rash or no lesions.  His cranial nerves II
through XII are intact.  Strength 4/5 in the lower
extremities bilateral, [**6-12**] upper bilateral.

LABORATORIES:  White count of 25.4 with 80% neutrophils, 2
bands, 5 lymphocytes.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.4, chloride
104, bicarb 24, BUN 39, creatinine 2.5, glucose 153.  PT
26.7, PTT 29, INR 4.7.

Electrocardiogram showed V-paced at 86 beats per minute.

Chest x-ray showed a right IJ in place with a ...............
cardiac silhouette.  Stable bilateral pleural effusions.

His urinalysis was cloudy with large leukocytes, positive
nitrates, large blood, greater than 50 red blood cells, 0
white blood cells, and few bacteria.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Service for
workup of confusion and hypotension.  After fluid
resuscitation in the Emergency Room, he appeared to be
mentating well, and he was hemodynamically stable.  However,
he was observed overnight in the Intensive Care Unit.  MICU
course was complicated by 1) a drop in hematocrit from 47 to
33.  This is thought to be secondary to hemodilution and
hematuria.  His hematocrit remains stable, only slowly dipped
from downward during his hospitalization.  Upon discharge it
was around his baseline of 31.

2. Elevated INR.  This was thought to be secondary to
ciprofloxacin and Coumadin.  His Coumadin was held and his
INR reversed.

3. Acute renal failure.  He presented with a creatinine well
above baseline at 2.5.  This resolved with IV fluids and was
thought to be secondary to dehydration in the setting of
fever and diarrhea.  This improved with hydration.  However,
later in his hospital course when patient's mental status was
not alert enough for him to maintain adequate po, his acute
renal failure recurred.  This was thought to be
multifactorial secondary to obstruction which was relieved by
the placement of the Foley catheter as well as dehydration.
He was aggressively hydrated, and his creatinine began to
return to normal.

A Renal consult was obtained and the urine was not consistent
with a glomerulonephritis and suggested starting Flomax which
was begun.

4. Infectious Disease:  The patient presented with fever and
mental status changes.  Initially, this was thought to be
urinary tract infection, however, several blood cultures came
back positive for MRSA bacteremia.  It was unclear as to the
source of this.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was attained
and revealed no vegetations, however, a followup
transesophageal echocardiogram was then performed and
additionally no vegetations were found, thus making
endocarditis less likely.

CT scan of the abdomen was attained, which did not
demonstrate any focal finding of infection, but only
hydroureter and distention of the bladder when the Foley was
not in place.  He was started on Vancomycin; in a few days
his fevers resolved.  His blood cultures cleared.  A PICC
line was placed.  Although no definite source was found, this
was thought to be in the vascular source to have such high
grade bacteremia.  He was continued on Vancomycin for six
weeks.

Infectious Disease was consulted throughout hospitalization,
and additional recommendations were given, however, still no
clear source was found.  There was concern for a possible
prostatitis or abscess.  However, per the Genitourinary team,
his rectal examination was nontender making prostatitis less
likely, therefore this is not pursued.

5. Genitourinary:  He had extensive hematuria during his
hospital stay likely secondary to his transitional cell
carcinoma and subsequent treatment with BCG and interferon.
Urology followed him throughout his hospitalization.

The patient tried a voiding trial.  The Foley was removed,
although he did have urine output, it dropped off, and his
renal failure increased.  It was noted by the Renal team that
his creatinine began to rise upon discontinuation of the
Foley.  It was therefore replaced, and dehydration
normalized.  CT was performed in-house, although lacked,
Infectious Disease focus did demonstrate a mildly tortuous
hydroureter and mild hydronephrosis that was present on
retrograde pyelogram three months prior, therefore this is
not a new finding.  This was discussed with the Renal team,
however, they felt that in the set with such an improved
creatinine with replacement, it would be best to leave the
Foley in x2 weeks to allow total decompression at that point
to give a voiding trial.

The patient's mental status cleared.  He became more alert
and began to maintain adequate po, and ask questions
appropriately which was much closer to his baseline mental
status.  It was thought at this time that he would be
suitable for discharge.  He was screened and accepted at
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation to complete a total six week course of
Vancomycin for the high grade bacteremia.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Warfarin 10 mg po q hs.
2. Carvedilol 6.25 mg po bid.
3. Vancomycin .......... 4.5 weeks.
4. Senna one tablet po bid.
5. Docusate sodium 100 mg po bid.
6. Wellbutrin 150 mg po bid.
7. Levothyroxine 75 mcg po q day.
8. Finasteride 5 mg po q day.
9. Pantoprazole 40 mg po q24h.
10. Multivitamins one cap po q day.
11. Atorvastatin 20 mg po q hs.
12. Celexa 40 mg po q day.
13. Donepezil 10 mg po q hs.

Initially, it was suggested that Flomax be started, however,
patient had allergy to Lasix, which has a crossology with
Flomax, therefore it was begun.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  He had followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 101824**].
