Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 11306**] Urology service after undergoing
bilateral stent change.  The patient was scheduled for day
surgery, but became hypotensive, tachycardic in the day surgery
PACU, requiring pressors.  The patient was transferred from the
PACU to the ICU.  ICU course was significant for:

# SEPSIS
Mr. [**Known lastname 53270**] was admitted to the ICU in septic shock after
bilateral ureteral stent change.  He had an elevated lactate,
rising white blood cell count, fevers and hypotension not
responsive to fluids. He has a history of chronic infection in
the GU tract, in addition to VRE colonization.  He has been
admitted for severe sepsis after GU procedures on multiple
occasions since his neobladder surgery in [**Month (only) 956**]. On admission
to the ICU, the patient was requiring multiple pressors and was
started on treatment with linezolid and zosyn.   He was slowly
weaned off pressors and transferred back to the urology service
when hemodynamically stable.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
The patient presented to the ICU from the PACU with heart rates
in the 130s-150s, which appeared consistent with prior post-op
course and contributing to his hypotension. Triggers, likely
multifactorial, likely included post-op stress, hypovolemia, and
infection. He was started on an amiodarone drip, which
controlled his rhythm. Prior to transfer back to the urology
service, he was started on low-dose beta-blocker, which is to be
increased back to his home dose of metoprolol prior to discharge
from the hospital.

An Echo showed that his left atrium is mildly dilated, and there
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. He has some mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis.

# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Mr. [**Known lastname 53270**] was in rapidly worsening acute renal failure
post-operatively with oliguria and hyperkalemia, most likely
from Acute Tubular Necrosis secondary to hypotension.  A renal
ultrasound showed no concern for obstructive post-renal
etiology.  Lasix boluses were used to increase his urine output
and keep his potassium in check.  Prior to transfer from the
ICU, the patient started autodiuresing, and his kidney function
began to slowly improve.

# DIARRHEA
The patient presented with stool incontinence.  Due to history
of severe C. difficile infection, he was treated empirically
with metronidazole and per oral vancomycin.  His stool was
negative for C difficile during this hospitalization.

On POD 7, the patient was transferred to the floor in stable
condition.  On POD 8, the foley catheter was removed and the
patient continued to be incontinent as he was prior to
admission.  He was discharged in stable condition on POD 10,
creatinie trending down, WBC normal, with a PICC line in place
for 13 more doses of Zosyn and oral Vancomycin to be taken for
two days following Zosyn.  VNA services were arranged for the
administration of antibiotics and subsequent removal of PICC
line and in home physical therapy. He was instructed to follow
up with Renal on [**2127-11-11**] and provided a lab order slip (per
renal recs) for a Chem 10 to be drawn on [**2127-11-7**] at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**]
Clinical Center. He was instructed to contact Dr.[**Name (NI) 11306**]
office upon discharge to arrange/confirm follow up appointment.
