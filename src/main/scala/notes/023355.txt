Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Non-invasive ventilation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 yo M with a history of past MI, [**First Name3 (LF) 7921**] with EF 15%,
afib on coumadin, s/p pacer placement, who was transferred from
[**Hospital1 1501**] today after being diagnosed there with RLL pna on CXR after
lung exam was suspicious for consolidative process. Per
patient's daughter, he was coughing for 3 weeks and was
intermittently having altered mental status. Multiple CXR's up
until today did not show any evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
process. He was satting 87% on room air prior to transfer. With
3L O2 by NC, sats came up to 95%. Vitals prior to transfer
96.2ax 72 118/78 24.
.
On arrival to our ED, he was started on bipap after his DNR/DNI
status was confirmed with patient and HCP. His [**Name2 (NI) **] were notable
for a leukocytosis and ARF (no priors for comparison). Once
Bipap was initiated, his sats responded well, however, he became
hypotensive (100/50 -> 80 with starting bipap). He was given 2L
NS, then levophed was started through peripheral line in lieu of
IVF given unknown EF. He was also given aspirin, vanco, CTX and
levofloxacin for his pneumonia. Blood cultures were drawn. On
transfer, his pulse 70, BP 99/70, RR 20, satting 100% on bipap.

.
He is transferred to the MICU for further management. Currently,
the patient is comfortable on bipap, moving extremities, but not
quite alert.

AP UPRIGHT CHEST: The right costophrenic angle is not imaged.
Well definied right lower lobe opacity and ill defined left
lower lobe opacities likely represents pneumonia. There is
moderate cardiomegaly. A single- lead pacemaker overlies the
left ventricle. The imaged osseous structures are unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75 yo M with [**Last Name (LF) 7921**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 15%, afib on coumadin, s/p pacer
placement, admitted from [**Hospital1 1501**] with RLL pna and respiratory
distress.
.
#. Respiratory distress: felt most consistent with HCAP, with
leukocytosis to 20, for which he was initially treated with
vanc/ceftriaxone/levaquin and BiPaP starting [**5-25**].  He was
quickly weaned down to nasal canula by 12PM on [**5-26**], and
switched to vancomycin (dosed by level, 12 on [**5-26**]), and zosyn
for HCAP starting [**5-27**].  His WBC came down to 10.  He was gently
diuresed with lasix drip on [**5-26**], and repeat CXR appeared
euvolemic, thus he was switched back to his oral regimen of
lasix on [**5-27**].  He is being discharged back to rehab with plan
to complete a 7 day course of antibiotics, and resume his home
regimen of diuretics.
.
#. Hypotension: pt was transiently noted to be hypotensive at
the same time bipap was placed which was felt most likely [**1-4**]
reduced venous return with peep.  He improved modestly with
500cc IVF bolus, but transiently required levophed for ~3 hrs,
which was discontinued at 4AM on [**5-26**].  He maintained SBP 100s
off pressors since that time, and was restarted on his home
lopressor at the time of discharge.  He should have the
remainder of his home antihypertensives restarted at rehab
(diovan, spirionlactone) given his significant heart failure at
baseline.  He has 2 sets of blood cultures, [**5-25**] and [**5-26**] which
are still pending at the time of discharge and will need to be
followed by after her arrival to rehab (by calling our
microbiology lab, [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]).
.
#. Cardiology - pt had a mild troponin elevation, with negative
CK, and MB, consistent with his mild renal failure.  From a
volume standpoint, he was initially felt to be slightly volume
overloaded, and he was treated with a lasix drip given his
transient hypotension, and transitioned back to his usual home
regimen of lasix on [**5-27**].  His diovan and spirinolactone were
held [**1-4**] initial hypotension, but should be restarted as his
blood pressure stabilizes.  His aspirin and metoprolol were
restarted prior to his discharge.
.
Regarding his rythym , he remained paced, and was continued on
amio.  Digoxin was held initially pending his level, and
restarted once his level returned normal.  He was on coumadin
previously, but had been getting this held at [**Hospital1 1501**].  His INR was
supratherapeutic during this hospitalization (4.4) on [**5-27**], so
this continued to be held, but should be restarted once his INR
< 3.0.
.
# HTN - as above, his anti-hypertensives were held given initial
hypotension.  his metoprolol was restarted prior to discharge.
He should have his spironolactone and diovan started if his
blood pressure is stable at rehab.
.
# ARF - baseline unknown, but per [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] records, his
creatinine was 2.0 in [**2109**] [**1-4**] CHF exacerbation.  Upon arrival,
CRE 1.8, and trended down to 1.5 with lasix drip.  His diovan
and spironolactone were held, but should be restarted at rehab.
He was discharged home on his home regimen of lasix orally.
.
# DM2 - he was continued on insulin sliding scale.
.
# PSYCH - he was continued on cymbalta and risperdal.
.
# Code: code status was discussed, and the pt is DNR/DNI
confirmed with patient in ED and HCP's here in MICU.
