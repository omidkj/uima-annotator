CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2120-2-2**] 3:21
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive pulmonary embolus, which is greater on the right.

2. Expected postoperative changes of aortic aneurysm repair with
no evidence of leak. Mediastinal hematoma, most likely
post-surgical.

3. New elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. No evidence of
herniation of the stomach into the thorax. However, the entire
left hemidiaphragm is not included on this study and the upper
abdomen should be included on the followup examination.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2120-1-29**]

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-23**]:
Opacification at the base of the left hemithorax and leftward
mediastinal shift are stable since [**1-23**]. Most of this is
due to persistent moderate left pleural effusion, and although I
don't think there is collapse of the left lower lobe, there must
be appreciable atelectasis in order to produce left rather than
right mediastinal shift. Right lung is clear. Post-operative
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable and unchanged.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.

DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2120-1-17**] IMPRESSION: Normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] scale and
doppler evaluation of the kidneys.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2120-1-16**] IMPRESSION:
Large thoracoabdominal aneurysm measuring 6.9 x 6.6 cm at the
widest point at the level of the left ventricle. Aneurysmal
dilatation is markedly ectatic particularly within the lower
thorax. There is no CT evidence of acute rupture.

[**2120-1-29**] 6:50 PM

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)

THREE VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: Just right of the midline, in the
mid abdomen, a dilated loop of small bowel is again identified.
However, the number and degree of dilated small bowel loops is
decreased since the radiograph obtained two days prior. Air is
identified distally in the rectum. No abnormal air- fluid levels
are identified.

The lung bases demonstrate a left pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis. The left heart border is obscured,
likely by a left lower lobe consolidation. Surgical clips in the
thorax and upper abdomen are indicative of prior surgery.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in ileus.

2. Left pleural effusion and consolidation, likely atelectasis
alone, but superimposed infection is possible.


Brief Hospital Course:
CTA showing a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm measuring 6.9 x
6.6 cm at the widest point at the level of the left ventricle.
Aneurysmal dilatation is markedly ectatic particularly within
the lower thorax. There is no CT evidence of acute rupture.

Admitted to Vascular Surgery / Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further
management.

[**2120-1-17**] patient was taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
resection and repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysm with 32-mm
Dacron graft with visceral reimplantation.

[**Date range (1) 76861**]/08

Post-operatively patient was in the ICU. Patient recieved
routine ICU care, blood gases, electrolytes and other lab works
were monitored. Electrolytes repleted as needed. Patient was
transfused with red blood cells for low HCT. Patient remained
intubated and sedated, successfully extubated on [**2120-1-21**]. Patient
had a chest tube from the OR that was dicontinued without
incident on POD 7, CXR taken post chest tube pull was neg.
Patient's BP and HR were monitored per ICU routine. Patient had
problems of hypertension and tachycardia. He was treated with
Hydralazine, Metoprolol and Labetalol IV, eventually switched to
oral form. Pain managed with PCA Morphine. Patient had no
neurological

[**2120-1-24**]

patient was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 VICU status/telemetry with and
NGT, PCA Morphine, started on sips.

[**2120-1-25**]

PCA Morphine d/c'd, switched over to Hydromorphone IV prn, then
switched over to Oxycodone. NGT d/c'd.

[**2120-1-26**]

patient started physcial  after evaluation, continued physical
therapy,  currently cleared for home d/c. Central line d/c'd,
PIV placed.

[**2120-1-27**]

patient had problems with abdominal distention, NGT replaced.
KUB showing-Mild dilatation of small bowel loops, consistent
with ileus, better on [**1-29**] KUB.     Patient kept NPO except
meds.

[**2120-1-31**]

Foley was d/c'd. No urinary problems after.

[**2120-2-2**]

started sips, tolerated well, NGT d/c'd the following day.

[**2120-2-2**]

Patient had some episodes of desturation and tachycardia during
ambulation, no SOB at rest. CTA showed-Extensive pulmonary
embolus, which is greater on the right, treated with Heparin
drip, placed on Lovenox bridge / Coumadin, will be dicharged on
Coumadin and will follow outpatient with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] further
episodes, currently stable on no oxygen support. Resumed
telemetry.

[**2120-2-4**]

Patient had tachycardia with activity again- EKG no acute
changes, self limiting, pt r/o for MI

[**2-5**] - [**2-7**]

Awaiting DC planning / pt with no PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to set patient up
with PCP to [**Name9 (PRE) **] INR.
