Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin / Oxycodone / Lorazepam

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, tachycardia, mouth sores

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31205**] is an 89 year old male with history of COPD and
tracheo-bronchial malacia (recently stented) who is presenting
from rehab with tachycardia, worsening oral ulcers and
difficulty breathing.  Patient reports onset 10 days ago with
progressive worsening of breathing difficulty, especially worse
at night.  No CP, no cough, no ABP/N/V/F/C, no lower extremity
swelling, no increased orthopnea (3 pillows).  He reports that
he currently feels exactly the same as prior admissions for
COPD, and he always gets better with prednisone.  He finished
his prednisone taper about 1 week ago from a prior COPD
exacerbation.
.
He was placed on CPAP in the ED and his VS were 120 102/57 22
100.   Upon arrival to the ICU team, respiratory therapy was at
the bedside and recommended that non-rebreather may be a more
comfortable option for him given his extensive oral ulcers which
were bleeding.  He was started on this and his O2 saturations
remained > 95% on NRB.  He reported that he felt much more
comfortable.  He is asking for ice chips and very clearly wants
to be DNR/DNI.
.
Of note he was recently admitted for T-tube/Y stent placement
which was done [**2172-10-19**] (failure to decannulate at rehab). On
[**2172-10-20**], he had more hoarsness and went for a revision of the T
tube with IP. Additionally, sputum grew out GPC and GNR and he
was placed empirically on vanc and levo (history of
Stenotrophomonas, E. coli, and MRSA in bronchial washings from
[**2172-10-7**]).  After discussion with ID fellow, the primary team
started cefepime given the resistance of E. coli from culture on
[**2172-10-7**], which was sensitive only to zosyn, meropenem, and
gentamicin.
.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood and urine cultures - no growth to date

IMAGING:

CXR (on admission):
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.
Midline
sternotomy wires are again noted. There has been interval
placement of a
right arm PICC line with its tip located in the expected
location of the
superior vena cava. Lung volumes are markedly low which limits
the
[**Month/Day/Year 2742**]. Additionally, the left CP angle is excluded.
Allowing for these limitations, there is no focal consolidation,
effusion, pneumothorax. Heart size could not be assessed.
Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable though when compared
with prior CT from [**2172-10-2**] mediastinal widening likely reflects
ectatic vasculature. Bony structures appear intact.

IMPRESSION: Limited, negative. PA and lateral view with more
optimized
inspiratory effort may be performed to confirm.

CXR ([**2173-10-28**]):

FINDINGS: A right-approach PICC tip terminates within the mid
SVC. Clips
overlie the right upper quadrant. The patient is status post
median
sternotomy. There are persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar
scattered
atelectasis. There are no new focal opacities concerning for
pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable
with a tortuous somewhat dilated thoracic aorta. Pulmonary
vascularity is not increased.

IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2173-10-27**] with no
evidence of
pneumonia. (re-read by ICU team and felt to be a RLL infiltrate

EKG: Baseline artifact. Wide complex rhythm. Probable
supraventricular tachycardia, rate 150. Consider atrial flutter
but not typical. Indeterminate axis. Right bundle-branch block.
Since the previous tracing of [**2173-9-27**] the rate is faster.
Otherwise, findings are unchanged. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
