Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with COPD on home O2 (2-3L) and frequent PNA
who presented yesterday to the ER from his nursing home with
fever, hypoxia and altered mental status. Sats were in the 50s
and came up to 90s with NRB by EMS. In the ED his rectal temp
was 102. A CXR demonstrated a LLL PNA. Labs notable for acute on
chronic kidney injury and hyperkalemia. He also had a positive
UA.

Of note, he was recently admitted for hematuria and had bladder
fulgeration on [**2139-1-28**]. Has also been getting PO vanc for C.
Difficile infection.

In the ER he was given vanc, zosyn, flagyl. EKG without ischemic
changes or peaked T-waves, no QRS widening. He received
insulin/glucose, calcium and kayexelate. His saturation was up
to 92% on 4L, however he was admitted to the ICU given the high
oxygen requirement.

ROS positive for cough productive of green phlegm, and chronic
chest pain, abdominal (suprapubic), and rectal pain, which are
all unchanged. Has burning sensation when he urinates.
Constipated. Otherwise negative.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS [**2139-2-3**]: Patient's condition required
examination in sitting semi-upright position using frontal AP
and left lateral projection. Comparison is made with the next
previous chest single AP chest view examination of [**2139-1-24**] as well as a more recent single chest view of [**2139-2-2**]. Moderate cardiac enlargement and elongation of generally
widened thoracic aorta as before. Unchanged position of
previously described left-sided permanent pacer with dual
intracavitary electrode system. Already on examination of
[**1-24**], the patient had bilateral plate atelectasis but no
conclusive evidence for pleural effusions. On [**2-2**], the
portable single view examination demonstrated an increased
density on the left base obscuring the diaphragmatic contour and
suggesting the presence of an increased atelectasis. Today's AP
and lateral chest views again demonstrate the presence of a
diffuse density in the left base, most likely representing
atelectasis or pneumonic infiltrate. On the lateral view, one
can identify an increased density along a major fissure
supporting the assumption that pleural effusion has developed.
The patient's respiratory effort appears limited as the
diaphragmatic contours are relatively high and the basal lung
vasculature is markedly crowded. Most likely diagnosis is
increasing CHF probably with superimposed left basal atelectasis
or infection. No pneumothorax is present.

Renal ultrasound [**2139-2-2**]
IMPRESSION: Mild right pelvicaliectasis and extrarenal pelvis
similar to the CT from [**2139-1-25**], but slightly more prominent
compared to the US from [**2139-1-2**].

[**2139-2-3**] VIDEO SWALLOW EXAMINATION:
TECHNIQUE: Oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was
performed in
conjunction with the speech and swallow division. Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered.
FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and
esophagus without evidence of obstruction. There is trace
penetration of thin liquids, but no gross aspiration. For full
details, please refer to speech and swallow division note in the
OMR.
IMPRESSION: Trace penetration of thin liquids with no evidence
of aspiration.
