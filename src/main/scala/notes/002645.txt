[**2117-3-27**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75yo M with a recent history of a VATS right lower
lobectomy performed on [**2117-3-17**] with a postoperative course
requiring bronchoscopy due to persistent hypoxia and inability
to
clear secretions.  He subsequently continued to recover and was
discharged home with VNA, home physical therapy, and home O2 on
[**2117-3-23**].  Yesterday the patient was reportedly lethargic at home
with a low grade temperature.  Today the patient's daughter
called to report that he had a temperature of 102.1 and hence
the
patient was directed to come to the emergency room for
evaluation.
Upon evaluation, the patient reports that he has had some
lethargy for the past day.  He also reports some continuing SOB,
and does get short of breath with exertion. His cough is
productive of sputum, some of it rust tinged.

[**2117-3-25**] Chest CT :
1. Overall growth and progressive gaseous contents of a large
right infrahilar phlegmon, probably an abscess, and larger air
and fluid loculations in the dependent right pleural space, are
indirect but strong indications of active connections between
the lungs or airway and the pleurae, even though a discrete
connection from the lower lobe bronchial stump is not visible.
The findings of peripheral alveolitis in the left lung conform
to 'spillover' pneumonitis seen in such circumstances. Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7343**] was paged to discuss these findings, at the time
of dictation.
2. Right middle lobe bronchus is still obliterated.
3. Severe coronary artery calcification and possible aortic
valvular
stenosis.
.
[**2117-3-27**] CT guided drainage :
CT-guided placement of 10 French pigtail catheter into the right
complex
pleural air/fluid collection. Requested laboratory analysis
pending
.
[**2117-3-30**] Cardiac echo :
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF
55-65%). The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2117-4-14**] Fluoro for HD catheter:
Successful placement of a tunneled hemodialysis access catheter
through the left internal jugular vein approach. The distal tip
is located in the right atrium and the proximal lumen at the
SVC/right atrial junction. The catheter is ready for use.
.
[**2117-4-15**] CXR:
: Compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received
a new
hemodialysis catheter over a left-sided approach. The course of
the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects
over the right atrium.  Otherwise, there is no relevant change.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged mild fluid
overload. Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with a
mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion. Focal parenchymal
opacities have newly occurred.
.
[**2117-4-19**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Monitoring and supporting devices are in standard
position.
Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusions
associated with adjacent lung atelectasis and bilateral
pulmonary vascular congestions is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. No new interval changes in the lung.
.
[**2117-4-19**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION:
No right or left lower extremity DVT.
