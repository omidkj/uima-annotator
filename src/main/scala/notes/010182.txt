HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Cervical spondylotic
myelopathy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a very pleasant 59-year-old female
with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, who underwent C4 to C7,
who underwent C4, C5 and C6 corpectomy and C3 to C7 fusion
using a fibular allograft.  Postoperatively, the patient was
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight
observation.

On postoperative day #1, [**2189-11-12**], the patient was
extubated and had [**Last Name **] problem or difficulty.  However, he had
a sore throat and he was able to tolerate a clear liquid
diet.  On postoperative day #1, [**2189-11-12**] the patient was
noticed to have a weakness of her left deltoid.  The patient
received physical therapy throughout the hospital stay for
left arm weakness, which gradually improved throughout this
hospital stay.  On postoperative day #1, which was on
[**2189-11-12**], the CT scan of the cervical spine was obtained,
which showed the hardware to be malpositioned.

On hospital day #2 the hematocrit went down to 26.9, for
which she received two units of packed red blood cells.  On
postoperative day #3, which was [**2189-11-14**], the hematocrit
was 34.  Due to the fact that the cervical spinal plate was
malpositioned, the patient was taken back to the operating
room on [**2189-11-6**] for removal of the screw and the adjustment
of the anterior cervical plate.  Postoperatively, from this
operation, the patient had gradual improvement of the left
arm strength.

On hospital day #5, the patient was tolerating a clear liquid
diet, however, he had difficulty tolerating solid food.

On hospital day #5, the patient had decreased saturation on
room air to about 88 and 89 and the patient was placed on
face mask.  At this time x-ray showed elevated hemidiaphragm
on the left side.  The patient had fluoroscopic examination
on hospital day #8, which showed normal movement of the
diaphragm.  Upon request of the Medicine consultation, x-ray
taken on [**2189-11-17**] showed question consolidation of the left
lower lobe.  The patient was placed on Levaquin for the
diagnosis of pneumonia.  The patient continued the
antibiotics throughout the hospital course.  On postoperative
day #8, the patient was advancing to a regular diet with
slight nausea, which improved, after discontinuation of the
narcotic pain medications.  The patient was tolerating the
pain with a combination of Tylenol and Ultram.  The patient
continued physical therapy.  The patient was able to walk
independently on [**2189-11-20**].  CT scan with sagittal
reconstruction was taken on [**2189-11-16**] showing hardware to be
in correct position and fibular graft, even though not
optimal, in acceptable position.  Throughout this hospital
stay, the patient was in a cervical collar and instructed to
continue wearing the cervical collar for the next three
months.  Throughout this hospital stay, the patient gradually
improved his oxygen supplementation and on [**2189-11-20**] the
oxygen supplementation in the form of face mask was
discontinued.  At that time, the room saturation was at 96 to
97.  The patient was able to tolerate solid food on
[**2189-11-19**].  The patient was ambulating well, tolerating
solid food, good pain control.  The patient was not nauseated
on [**2189-11-21**].  The patient was discharged home on [**2189-11-23**]
in good condition.

X-ray studies, taken throughout this hospital course showed
fullness on the right hilum of the right lung.  It was
discussed with the patient to followup with the primary care
physician to rule out any pathology of the right lung.  The
patient understood and the primary care physician was
[**Name (NI) 653**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  The patient was tolerating
solid food and had good pain control on [**2189-11-22**].

Upon discharge, the left arm weakness was improving slowly.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Cervical spondylotic myelopathy status post
fusion from C3 to C7 and C4, C5, and C6 corpectomy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin for antibiotics.  The
patient was instructed to take this ten days after discharge.

Upon discharge, the patient had no neck pain.  The patient
was feeling comfortable.  We will see this patient back in
the Orthopedic Surgery Clinic within three weeks.  We will
obtained EMGs of the left arm, prior to this visit.
