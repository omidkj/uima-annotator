Radiology
[**5-7**] Abd/pelvic CT: Interim development of mildly dilated small
bowel loops and air fluid levels, with air and stool seen
throughout the colon. No clear transition point is identified.
The findings are suggestive of partial small-bowel obstruction.
Ascites fluid may be slightly increased from the prior study.
Unchanged partially cystic and solid pelvic mass concerning for
an ovarian neoplasm.  Patchy opacities of the left lung base may
reflect pneumonia versus atelectasis. This finding is new from
the prior exam. Atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and
branches. The mesenteric vessels are not well evaluated without
IV contrast.

[**5-14**] Renal scan: The tracer was administered intravenously. Flow
was obtained and dynamic images were then obtained for 40
minutes. The images demonstrate delayed concentration in both
kidneys. The right kidney is malrotated and there may be pooling
in the right renal pelvis, or this could be related to kidney
position. There is filling of the bladder. No tracer
extravasation is seen. No evidence of ureteral leak. Findings
consistent with renal parenchymal abnormality such as acute
tubular necrosis.

[**5-14**] Renal U/S: The right and left kidneys measure 8.7 and 9.5 cm
respectively without hydronephrosis nor focal lesions. There are
bilateral pleural effusions and ascites.

[**5-16**] CT Head: No intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift
of normal midline structures, major or minor vascular
territorial infarct is apparent. The density values of brain
parenchyma within normal limits. Surrounding osseous and soft
tissue structures are unremarkable.

[**5-17**] KUB: Residual contrast material, presumably from the CT
study of [**2107-5-7**] is seen at the hepatic flexure, the splenic
flexure, and the distal sigmoid/rectum. Multiple staples project
over the left lower quadrant. No air-fluid levels or distended
loops of bowel are present. There are marked degenerative
changes of the lower lumbar spine. There is moderate-severe
joint space narrowing at the right hip.

[**5-19**] right arm ultrasound: Nonocclusive right internal jugular
vein thrombus. Probable right axillary lymphocele

[**5-21**] CXR: One portable view. Comparison with the previous study
done [**2107-5-16**]. There is interval improvement in pulmonary
vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. The
heart appears large and the aorta is tortuous and calcified as
before. Degenerative arthritic changes are again noted in the
right shoulder joint.

Pathology
[**5-13**]:
Left ovary and fallopian tube (A-D): Ovary with serous cyst
adenofibroma, 0.5cm, and endosalpingiosis. Fallopian tube, no
diagnostic abnormalities recognized (additional levels were
examined).

Right ovary and fallopian tube (E-R): Endometrial
adenocarcinoma, grade I, arising in a serous cystadenofibroma
Histologic Type:  Endometrioid, carcinoma, G1: well
differentiated. Washings/cytology:  Negative.
Primary Tumor TNM (FIGO):  pT1a (IA):  Tumor limited to 1 ovary;
capsule intact, no tumor on ovarian surface.  No malignant cells
in ascites or peritoneal washings.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pNX:  Cannot be assessed.
Lymph Nodes:  None submitted.
Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.
Venous/lymphatic vessel invasion (V/L):  Absent.
Comments:  Thrombus of hilar vessels and hemorrhagic infarction
of tumor consistent with torsion.
vessels are not well evaluated without IV contrast.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, Ms [**Known lastname 65453**] was [**Age over 90 **] yo G6P2 woman, with hx of CAD s/p
IMI, breast CA s/p mastectomy, and known right adnexal mass who
presented to the ED on [**2107-5-7**] with RLQ abd pain. Initially
there was concern for partial SBO possibly from ovarian mass.

1) Ovarian Mass/small bowel obstruction While patient was on
medicine team there was a discussion with team and pallative
care to undergo surgery to treat possible bowel obstruction. The
patient and family initially did not want surgery given high
surgical risk, however later changed their decision after felt
removal of ovarian mass would improve pain symptoms. Patient
underwent ex-lap on [**2107-5-13**] and was found to have R ovarian mass
with torsion. Both her ovaries and tubes were removed.
Intra-operatively, there was no clear evidence of bowel
obstruction; it was felt that her ovary, which was now removed,
may have been causing a physical obstruction. Her diet was
advanced and she did not have further evidence of bowel
obstruction. The surgical pathology was consistent with Grade I
endometrial carcinoma.  No malignant cells in ascites or
peritoneal washings. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] 3 weeks
following discharge to discuss further management/treatment.

2) Renal failure: Post-operatively, her creatinine rose to 1.6.
Renal scan was not consistent with ureteral leak and renal
ultrasound was without evidence of obstruction. It was felt that
she likely had ATN related to surgery. Her creatinine on
discharge was 1.4; this should be closely monitored as an
outpatient to ensure downward trend.

3) Postoperative Delerium: This was likely related to
anesthesia/hospital-indiced delirium. She gradually improved
with zyprexa qhs and prn. There was no evidence of concurrent
infection.

4) Catheter Associated DVT:  The patient developed RUE swelling;
U/S showed clot in RIJ from RIJ line (subsequently removed). She
was continued on anticoagulation.

5) HTN: The patient was restarted on beta-blocker, nifedipine
(titrated up), valsartan, and Nitropatch with good control

6) Atrial fibrillation: She was continued on metoprolol as
above. Her INR will need to be closely monitored as an
outpatient and
