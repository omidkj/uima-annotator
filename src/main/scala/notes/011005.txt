History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 86 yo man with PMH of CAD, s/p CABG x 3, CHF with EF
35%, Afib/flutter, CLL, mitral valve replacement in [**2165**] who
initially presented on [**2177-10-24**] with c/o R shoulder pain.  In

RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
[**2177-10-28**] CT CHEST: Interval improvement of multifocal pneumonia
including decreased size of RUL and RLL consolidations. No new
foci of consolidations. Interval development of large right and
moderate-sized left pleural effusions with subsegmental
atelectasis of the lower lung lobes.
*
[**10-28**] TEE: No vegetation.
[**2177-10-27**] TTE: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5660**] dilated. Mild symmetric LVH.
Regional WMA include near akinesis of the inferior and IL walls.
The remaining walls are mildly hypokinetic. No masses or
thrombi. RV mildly dilated with free wall HK. Severe aortic
stenosis is not suggested. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal disc motion
and
transvalvular gradients. Moderate PA systolic HTN. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. No
vegetation.
*
[**2177-10-24**] P-MIBI: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG
changes.
Ventricular ectopy. Nuclear images with mild, partially
reversible perfusion defect in the distal anterior wall. Severe
global HK with depressed LVEF of 33%.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) MRSA bacteremia and septic arthritis: Seen by orthopedics who
tapped joint, cultures significant for septic joint with MRSA in
synovial culture. Blood cultures on admission also significant
fo 8/8 bottles with MRSA. Placed on Vancomycin and CTX. While on
medical floor, had atrial fibrillation with RBR with respiratory
distress and septic picture and was transferred to MICU. In ICU,
cosyntropin stimulation test was appropriate. Vancomycin was
continued and Gentamycin added for synergy on [**10-26**]. Also given
single dose of Rifampin on [**10-26**] per ID suggestions. TTE on
[**10-27**] remarkable for EF 30%, negative for vegetation and TEE the
following day also negative for vegetation. The pt was weaned
down from NRB to NC from a respiratory standpoint. Serial
imaging studies were consistent with CHF, slowing improving with
diruesis. HR controlled by BBlocker that was titrated up.
Transferred back to floor where all surveillance cultures remain
negative (since [**10-25**]). Vancomycin dosing was adjusted to 750 mg
IV bid for high troughs. Per ortho, as pt was clinically
improving, there was no need for operative washout of R shoulder
joint. Will need 6 week course total (day 1 [**10-24**]) of IV
vancomycin with troughs, CBC, Cr checked q weekly and faxed to
ID office ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**]).
*
2) Ischemic heart disease: P-MIBI during admission with a mild
partially reversible anterior wall defect. Medical management
was optimized with asa, b-blocker, statin, ACE-I.
*
3) CHF: EF on echo around 30%, serial imaging studies in ICU
consistent with left-sided heart failure. Given diuresis with
i/o goal of negative daily with subsequent improvement of b/l
pleural effusions. ACE-I started.
*
4) Legionella pneumonia: Resolving multifocal pneumonia on CT.
s/p 14-day course of Levofloxacin in 09/[**2177**]. Urinary legionella
antigen negative.
*
5) CRI: Creatinine at baseline (1.2-1.5). Unlear about the
etiology of his underlying renal insufficiency.
*
6) CLL: Elevated WBC at baseline, likely further exacerbated by
infection though his current differential is consistent with
CLL. His chronic anemia and transfusion dependence likely [**2-6**]
his hematologic malignancy +/- contribution from renal failure.
On Aranesp as an out-patient. He received 5 units of PRBCs since
admission.  Per heme-onc, no role for epogen in this pt who is
on aranesp at outpatient.
*
7) AF: Rate controlled with b-blocker.
*
8) Status post MVR: On heparin gtt during hospital course as
coumadin was originally held while possbility of operative
management of R shoulder was considered by orthopedics. Coumadin
restarted on [**10-29**] once ortho decided for non-surgical
management of pt given clinical improvement. INR subtherapeutic
on discharge at 1.3. Switched to LMWH for bridge while coumadin
becomes therapeutic on discharge.
*
9) PPx: LMWH, bowel regimen prn.

10) Code: DNR/DNI.

The pt was discharged to a rehab facility for IV abx (6 week
course), PT, OT, and anti-coagulation.
