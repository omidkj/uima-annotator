Service:  VSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
female who was admitted last week for a symptomatic abdominal
aortic aneurysm.  Her surgery was delayed due to multiple
comorbidities, which has since been evaluated.  She has a
cardiac history which has been evaluated and cleared.  Her
low-grade lymphoma and T3 retropulsion have been cleared.
She is now admitted for operative repair tomorrow.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right bundle branch block.

Atrial fibrillation.

Hypertension.

Coronary artery disease.

Myocardial infarction.

Lymphoma.

T3 retropulsion.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  PTCA and stenting.

Cholecystectomy.

C-section.

Transabdominal hysterectomy.

CEA.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 50 mg by mouth every day.
2. Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth every day.
3. Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg by mouth every day.
4. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth every day.
5. Toprol 50 mg by mouth every day.
6. Prednisone 5 mg by mouth every day.
7. Protonix 40 mg by mouth every day.
8. Albuterol inhalers and Advair inhalers.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.
Alert and oriented times three.  Heart is regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen has some mild tenderness
to palpation, but only trace.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused.  Neurologically:  The patient is grossly intact.

PERTINENT STUDIES:  The patient has a white count of 5.9,
hematocrit of 37.  Normal electrolytes.  EKG is normal sinus
rhythm, but with a right bundle branch block, no ischemia.
Chest x-ray is normal.  Urinalysis is negative.

The patient has a pulse exam with right and left popliteals,
femorals, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries all
palpable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2201-1-27**] at which time a repair of a juxtarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm with a 16 Dacron graft was performed, also an
aorta to right common iliac artery bypass graft with an 8-mm
Dacron graft was performed for a right leg ischemia.  The
operation was significant for 10.5 liter crystalloid input, 2
units of packed cells, and 2 liters of Cell [**Doctor Last Name **].

Postoperatively, the patient required a dobutamine drip and
remained intubated.  She was transferred to the Surgical ICU
for further postoperative care.  She received perioperative
Kefzol.  She also received Heparin subcutaneous for DVT
prophylaxis.

Over the first 24 hours in the ICU, the patient was
concerning for high bladder pressures and there was a fear
that the patient may require operative intervention to
prevent abdominal compartment syndrome.  However, with some
diuresis, her bladder pressures improved.  Also, the
patient's platelet count began to drop postoperatively.

She was screened for HIT, which was negative, but her Heparin
was changed to fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis.  Once the
patient showed that she was going to start mobilizing fluids,
she was diuresed using Lasix and had a good effect.  After
adequate amount of fluid was taken off and the patient's
respiratory function seemed okay, she was considered for
extubation.  However, before planned extubation, the patient
self extubated.  But tolerated being extubated.  She was
restarted on her home medications after a day challenge
breathing on her own.  The patient was restarted on a diet,
which she easily tolerated.

Shortly thereafter, the patient was transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit, where diuresis was continued.
She was continued on her home medications.  She did
experience considerable amount of confusion and received as
needed Zyprexa.  She has an unusual reaction to Ativan as per
her family.  She was also worked up for other causes
including electrolyte abnormalities, hypercapnia, infectious
causes, and none were found.  Apparently, all neurological-
affecting medications including pain medications were all
discontinued.

Patient developed a metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to
Lasix administration and high-output diuresis.  She was given
a day's worth of Diamox, which continued to aid her diuresis
as well as help to correct her metabolic alkalosis.  The
patient has been seen by physical therapy.  Throughout her
stay, it was indicated that rehab stay would benefit the
patient.  It is now [**2201-2-5**], and the patient is tolerating a
regular diet.  She is ambulating decently on her own with a
walker, diuresing independently without any medisonal
assistance and is ready to go to rehab.

She continues to have some confusion, however, she is
delightfully confused without any need for sitters or
restraints, and only occasionally required some mild
redirection.  She has good insight into the fact that she
sundowns.  This is felt to be due to deprivation of a normal
circadian lifestyle while in the hospital as medical causes
have been ruled out.  She will be discharged today if a bed
is available to rehab, where she will continue to regain her
strength.  She may observe a regular diet.  She is to
followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in approximately two weeks.
