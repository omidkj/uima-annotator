History of Present Illness:
75 yo woman with history of obesity, severe AS, CKD (baseline Cr
2.5)PVD, recently admited for decompensated heart failure and
evaluatation for AVR ([**Date range (1) 22379**]). During that hospitalization
she was diuresed with IV lasix, then transitioned to torsemide
10mg daily.  As the patient developed acute renal failure during
her hospitalization, the workup for AVR was postponed,
specifically cardiac catheterization.  The patient was
discharged on oral diuretics in an attempt to regain renal
function prior to restarting evaluation for AVR.
.
The patient was at [**Hospital **] rehab for three days before
representing.  Over the course of those three days, the patient
developed chest pain and worsening dyspnea, concerning for flash
pulm edema.  The family reports that her chest pain was left
sided, radiated to her back and left flank.  She reported that
the chest pain was persistent in nature.  In the AM, the patient
was given 40mg of IV lasix and placed on CPAP, however did not
tolerate well.   Cardiac enzymes were sent which showed Trop I
of 0.68, CKMB of 1.3, then increased to Trop I 1.07, and CKMB
2.3 the following morning.  During that time, the patient's EKGs
were unchanged with baseline RBBB.  The patient was started on a
heparin drip, given ASA, BBlocker, statin.  She was then placed
on BiPAP by EMS and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and treatment.
.
In the ED, her vital signs were HR 81 BP 122/39 93% on 2L n/c RR
16.  In the ED she was placed on CPAP, with an increase in her
O2 sat to  98%.  The patient had persistent 8/10 chest pain
during her stay in the ED, requiring multiple doses of morphine
2mg and 1mg of dilaudid.  The patient was found to have a Hct
drop to 26.7 and was guaiac positive.  Other labs showed Trop of
0.41 and worsening renal function at 2.7.
.
On transfer to the CCU, the patient was somnolent.  She was
found to have a decreased respiratory rate and an O2 sat in the
80s on 4L NC.  The patient was placed on a non-rebreather and an
ABG was sent which showed respiratory acidosis.  Her respiratory
rate and 02 sat initially improved, however then decreased
again.  The patient was given 4mg of narcan in an attempt to
reverse the effects of the narcotics.  Her respiratory status
was unstable and the patient was started on CPAP non invasive
ventilation and narcan drip.

.
Portable chest ([**4-5**]): The heart is enlarged. There are bibasal
effusions present. There is prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature consistent with moderate CHF. In addition, there is
an infiltrate at the right lung base which may represent
superimposed infection. CONCLUSION: Background moderate CHF with
possible infiltrate at the right lung base.  Please ensure
followup to clearance.
.
ECHO ([**4-7**]): The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricle is not well seen. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2138-3-28**], global LV systolic function
appears mildly hypokinetic on the current study. The degrees of
mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension have increased.
The degree of aortic stenosis is similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo woman with severe
aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity who presents with
dyspnea. Her respiratory distress is likely multifactorial with
contributing factors including respiratory supression from
overuse of narcotics in the ED, pulmonary edema secondary to
critical aortic stenosis and myocardial demand/ischemia, and
underlying OSA. Her respiratory status improved with narcan as
did her mental status. She was continued on non-invasive
ventilation with CPAP and gently diuresed on a lasix drip. She
was kept NPO initally with thought that aspiration may have
contributed, but eventually had speech and swallow which showed
no evidence of this. Etiology of her respiratory failure most
likely CHF from severe AS. Ultimate treatment would be
valvuloplasty vs. AVR, however the patient is not a candidate
for AVR. Given her poor peripheral access, it would also be
difficult to pursue valvulopasty. Her respiratory status
improved slightly but continued to have oxygen requirement and
was unable to lie flat therefore she would have required
intubation for this procedure. She had worsening renal function
likely secondary to poor forward flow and required high doses of
diuretics to maintain adequate urine output. Patient understood
her poor overall prognosis given severity of her aortic stenosis
with heart failure. She expressed a desire to discontinue all
aggressive measures in favor of comfort care. After multiple
discussion with the medical team, patient and family about all
possible options, she was made comfort care only. She was
transitioned to hospice care, continued on morphine as needed
for comfort and expired in the hospital several days later with
her family by her side.
