Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on Exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Alcohol septal ablation
DDI pacer placement

History of Present Illness:
76yoF with h/o HOCM, HTN, and severe MR but otherwise healthy
who was having DOE for 1 wk, no chest pain. She was diagnosed
with HOCM by a doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and as taking Atenolol daily for
this, no previous interventions. She was very active until about
a week ago at which point she notes worsening fatigue and DOE
with walking, generalized weakness, chest pressure immediately
upon lying down (relieved with sitting up) but denies any
exertional CP or other anginal symptoms.
.
About 2 wks ago she saw her PCP who referred her to a
Cardiologist 2d ago, who sent her to the ED. There, she had a
CXR showing pleural effusions and pulmonary edema with a BNP of
8141, negative Troponins, and EKG with NSR and unchanged
non-specific TW changes. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service where
they diuresed her and gave her beta blockers. Echo showed severe
sLVH with small LV cavity, EF >75%, severe resting LVOT gradient
in the 130's, [**Male First Name (un) **] of mitral leaflets and 3+ MR, all consistent
with HOCM of the elderly (and not due to abnormal myofibrils).
On [**2116-8-14**] she went to cath which showed clean coronaries and
elevated R heart pressures and had an alcohol septal branch
today which was tolerated well. She did however had some
widening of her QRS during the procedure and new appearance of
RBBB for which a temporary pacer wire was placed. She is
admitted to CCU for further monitoring.
.
Cardiac ROS as above: she was very active working 5d a week and
getting on the treadmill until the past week. She has been
generally weak, fatiguable on exertion and DOE even at minimal
walking distances. She reports chest pressure substernally
immediately when lying down but not with exertion and nothing
reminiscent of an MI. She's had minimal pitting edema around her
ankles. She felt palpitations with minimal exertion.
.
ROS otherwise states she was nauseous with food, but otherwise
her ROS is negative all other systems.

BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD, 2 cultures pending.
.
[**8-12**] CXR: Interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary
edema and
small bilateral pleural effusions. Unchanged opacity projecting
over the
right posterior hemidiaphragm, which again may represent a
Bochdalek hernia.
.
[**8-13**] ECHO: Severe symmetric LVH with small LV cavity size and
hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Consequently the mitral
leaflets and chordae are pulled towards the hypertrophied upper
septum during systole and a severe resting LVOT gradient
develops. Findings are more consistent with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy of the elderly than hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
due to abnormal myofibrils. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Unable to determine pulmonary artery systolic
pressures.
.
[**8-15**] CXR:
The tip of the temporary pacemaker lies in the first part of the
right
ventricle.

The heart is not enlarged. A left pleural effusion is present.
Small right
effusion is also seen. The lung fields appear clear. There is no
evidence of failure, atelectasis at the left base is noted.
.
[**8-19**] CXR: Cardiomegaly is stable. Left transvenous pacemaker
leads are in standard position in the right atrium and right
ventricle. There has been improvement of now mild vascular
congestion. Mild left greater than right pleural effusions
associated with atelectasis are grossly stable allowing the
difference in positioning of the patient.
