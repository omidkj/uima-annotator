hypotension

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o F w/MMP who was at rehab [**5-24**], noted to have decreased
responsiveness and fingerstick was 25. Given glucagon and oral
glucose, FS improved only to 30 so was sent to [**Location (un) **]. In ED,
was ? hypoxic and had afib with slow ventricular response, so
was admitted. Later that day, she was being transferred from the
bed to commode and her legs buckled, she slid to the ground, and
landed with her legs beneath her. She heard a "snap" and had
immediate pain, and xray showed a R intratrochanteric hip fx.
She was seen by [**Location (un) 1957**] there, and the plan (after discussion
between [**Location (un) 1957**] and her primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] was to
proceed with surgery although it is high risk given her
extensive coronary disease.) However, today she was hypotensive
in the 80s/40s with a K of 5.8, so her operation was cancelled
and she was sent to their ICU. She had a central line placed to
monitor CVP, which was 11. She was placed on dopamine with
improvement in her bp to 100s-110s. She was then transferred
here for further evaluation.
.
Her hospital course at [**Location (un) **] was also complicated by
respiratory depression which occurred after receiving 2 mg IV
dilaudid; this responded well to narcan. She also had a UTI
being treated with levofloxacin, persistent diarrhea being
treated as presumed C diff (although c diff negative), and acute
renal failure (creat 1.4 on admission, increased to 2.5 by day
of d/c).

acute renal failure [**4-6**], was staying at rehab since then

# Paroxysmal afib, on coumadin
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 40%

Social History:
Lived by herself prior to hospitalization in [**Month (only) 547**]. Never smoked
or drank. Was a housewife. Has 3 children from whom she is
estranged, but is close to her 2 grandsons.

Family History:
father died of MI at age 86, mother died at age 51 related to
complications from DM

IMAGING:
[**5-26**] AP CXR:
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2148-5-26**] at 18:28. No
prior films are available for comparison. The heart is likely
top normal in size. There is calcification and tortuosity of the
aorta and there are median sternotomy wires present. A
right-sided IJ line is present and it has its tip projected over
the expected location of the SVC. Linear atelectasis or scarring
is seen at the left base. There is no evidence of acute
consolidation or frank failure. There is deformity of the distal
clavicle likely secondary to prior trauma. IMPRESSION: Linear
atelectasis or scarring at the left base. Right-sided IJ line in
satisfactory position.
.
[**5-28**] Hip 2 views: There is an intramedullary rod and a gamma
nail.
.
[**5-30**] Port abd: 1)Limited study which is focused around the
pelvis rather than abdomen. However, no abnormal looking bowel
loop is demonstrated. No obstruction is noted. No
pneumoperitoneum is detected. 2) Status post fracture of the
right femoral neck with dynamic hip screw placement. Fracture
line is still well visualized.
.
[**2148-6-4**] Colonoscopy: Impression: External hemorrhoids, Internal
hemorrhoids; Erythema, friability, congestion and ulceration in
the rectum, compatible with possible inflammation from rectal
tube trauma; Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
Recommendations: The rectal inflammation was likely due to
rectal tube trauma. If rectal bleeding persists, a follow-up
flexible sigmoidoscopy should be performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9035**] is a 80 year old woman with CAD, CHF, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, who was admitted with hypotension and a hip
fracture. Her brief hospital course, by problem:
.
# Hypotension: Initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension
briefly requiring dopamine but resolved. Her CVP of 11 not
suggestive of either sepsis, volume depletion, or cardiogenic
shock.  Her leukocytosis is concerning, although may be due to
stress from her hip fracture. Her blood pressure remained stable
on the medicine floor and at the time of discharge, she had been
restarted on her antihypertensive medications.
.
# Bloody bowel movement. Had bloody BM x 2 on [**5-30**], with stable
hematocrit. She went for colonoscopy on [**6-4**], which showed
internal and external hemorrhoids as well as friable/inflammed
rectal mucosa (which was thought likely secondary to rectal
tube). If she continues to have rectal bleeding or pain, she
should have a flexible sigmoidoscopy in 4 weeks.
.
# Hip fracture. Underwent ORIF on [**5-28**], without complications.
She should continue Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for a total of 4 weeks, daily
dressing changes, and physical therapy. Pain control with
Tylenol and oxycodone.
.
# CAD. Given beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, and statin.
.
# ARF: Renal function continued to improve with fluids, thought
pre-renal etiology secondary to third-spacing from the hip
fracture. A foley was in place given a coccygeal ulcer, but this
should be removed when the patient is able to ambulate.
.
# UTI: Urinalysis positive on admission. Treated with
ciprofloxacin x 3 days.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Continued amiodarone.
.
# Diarrhea: Treated empirically at [**Location (un) **] (OSH) for C. diff,
but both C. diff A and B toxins were not detected in assays
here. Flagyl and vancomycin were discontinued. All other
infectious sources were ruled out.
.
# Diabetes: Covered with Humalog sliding scale, restarted Lantus
on [**2148-5-31**] at half home dose (15 units per AM) She was low FS so
this was decreased to 13 units.  Once she restarts on a normal
diet, lantus should be retitrated up.
