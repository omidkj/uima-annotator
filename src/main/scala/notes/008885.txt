Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, inferolateral STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography w/ angiojet clearance of thrombus
Drug eluting stent placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 34-yo male smoker with no past medical history
who came in to the ED today with a complaint of chest pain. His
chest pain started around 8am this morning and slowly progressed
over the course of the morning until he came in to the ED around
noon. It was [**10-10**] and mid-sternal, with radiation to the back
and the stomach. He had severe SOB and was unable to lie down
flat. He also had associated nausea, cold sweats, and dizziness.
On presentation to the ED, initial VS: Temp 98.5F, BP 144/91, HR
69, R 17, SaO2 100% RA. ECG showed infero-lateral ST elevations,
so CODE STEMI was activated. He received ASA 325mg and Plavix
600mg, and was started on heparin and integrillin gtts. He was
transferred to the cardiac cath lab, where he was found to have
an occluded LCx with thrombus. Angiojet was used to clear the
artery of thrombus, and a DES was placed to the region of the
thrombus in the mid-LCx. He did not have any other
angiographically significant disease. He is admitted to the CCU
for further care.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or
red stools. He notes rare hemoptysis. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is now notable for absence of chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

HEMODYNAMICS: PCWP 23
.
ECHO (TTE)
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the
inferior, inferolateral and lateral segments. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Trace aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
34-yo male smoker w/o PMH p/w chest pain and STEMI, s/p DES to
LCx.  Hospital course by problem:
.
#. ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Patient had angiojet
thrombus removal and drug eluding stent placement in the mid
left circumflex artery.  He was then started on daily Aspirin,
Plavix and high-dose statin.  Integrillin drip was continued for
18 hours. Repeat ECGs showed decreased, but persistent
ST-elevations.  CPK peaked at 4844, CK-MB at 233, and Trop-T at
5.84 before all three trended down.  Once his blood pressure had
stabilized he was started on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  Given the
large dye load of catheterization he was kept well hydrated.
Patient was chest pain-free during admission. He was discharged
on high dose statin, metoprolol, aspirin and Plavix.
.
# Acute Systolic Dysfunction, EF 40%: Patient had high pulmonary
capillary wedge pressures on right heart cath, but appeared
euvolemic on exam.  He was kept euvolemic.  Echocardiogram
showed mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior,
inferolateral and lateral segments, though the remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40%). Congestive heart
failure monitoring was reviewed with the pt at discharge. ACE
inhibitor was held for now because of low blood pressures and
the patient will be reassessed at his cardiology follow-up.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient had some episodes of accelerated
idioventricular rhythm following reperfusion.  These resolved
spontaneously and the patient remained in sinus rhythm for the
remainder of his stay.
.
# SOCIAL: Patient is an undocumented worker in the USA, making
him ineligible for Plavix Vouchers via [**Location (un) 16221**] [**Doctor Last Name 13469**] Squibb.
Social work was involved w/ patient discharge planning to ensure
he continues on Plavix upon leaving the hospital. Pt will have
appointment w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2172-8-14**] for close follow up care.  Pt
also referred to [**Hospital3 33953**] Health Center to establish primary
care at a free [**Hospital3 **]. He qualifies for free medicines
as well and should continue to get them from his primary care
doctor.
