from home with 2 days of BRBPR and abdominal pain.  She was
recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 106598**] with abdominal pain felt to be

## Imaging / other studies
.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy:
Ulceration at the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Biopsies taken and non-diagnostic
Immunohistochemistry is negative for cytomegalovirus, controls
are adequate.
.
CXR ([**2115-1-17**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**1-16**], there is increased
opacity at the left base consistent with volume loss and
possible supervening pneumonia.  Increased blunting is seen of
the left costophrenic angle, consistent with a small adjacent
effusion. Streaks of a right basilar atelectasis are also seen.
No evidence of vascular congestion. Central catheter tip is in
the lower portion of the SVC.
.
Abdominal/Pelvis CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Evidence of proctitis with rectal bowel wall thickening and
inflammation of the perirectal fossa.
2. Thrombosis of the right aortofemoral bypass graft which
appears chronic, given the clinical history. Left aortofemoral
graft and femoral-femoral bypass graft appear patent.
3. Left common femoral bifur
