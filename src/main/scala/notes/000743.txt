Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10488**]
Chief Complaint:
Found unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement
-[**2183-11-5**]
Intubated prior to admission

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60yo M with history of CHF, COPD, DM who was
brought to an outside hospital after bieng found down and was
transferred here for management of shock and respiratory
failure.
.
He was found unresponsive at home by his wife. She reported that
he had increasing lethargy over the several weeks prior and
seemed normal his morning but wa unresponsive around 3pm. At
that time blood glucose was 41. He was given 1 amp D50 by EMS.
After an additional amp of D50 and blood glucose 195, his mental
status was still poor. He was also hypothermic with temperative
93 and he was taken to [**Hospital3 2783**]. His initial vitals
there were T 92.2 BP 105/60, HR 56, RR 12, O2 90. A head CT was
negative. A CXR there was concernign for fluid overload. An echo
showed EF 10-15%. He was intubated for concern for mental
status. The initial impression was that he was in cardiogenic
shock and he was started on a heparin gtt and given PR ASA
before transfer here.
.
On arrival here, his CXR was felt to be consistent with
pneumonia and heparin was stopped and he was given cefepime and
levofloxacin. Glucose was still low at 56 and he was given 1amp
D50. He arrived with peripheral dopamine. This was weaned off
initially but blood pressure trended down and a R IJ was placed
and levophed started. On transfer, VS were 97/59, 57, 15, 99%
vent FiO2 100%, PEEP 5, tv 528

Imaging:
-CXR ([**11-5**]) - Low-lying ET tube. Retraction by at least 1.5 cm
is advised.  Advancement of NG tube result in more optimal
positioning. Scattered bilateral pulmonary opacities are
concerning for multifocal pneumonia, less likely pulmonary
edema. Findings D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19409**].

-TTE ([**11-6**]) - The left atrium is moderately dilated. Late
saline contrast is seen in left heart suggesting intrapulmonary
shunting. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %)
secondary to akinesis of the posterior and lateral walls and of
the apex, and hypokinesis of the inferior free wall. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. At least
moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen by color flow
Doppler. However, the inferior vena cava spectral Doppler signal
suggests that the tricuspid regurgitation could actually be 3+
or 4+. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

-Renal US ([**2183-11-7**]) - 1. Markedly limited examination secondary
to poor acoustic windows. No gross evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Doppler examination was unable to be performed.

-CT head ([**2183-11-12**]) - 1. No acute intracranial process. 2.
Apparent lucency through the right frontal bone, upon
correlation with coronal and sagittal reconstructions, is felt
to likely represent a suture, less likely nondisplaced fracture.
Clinical correlation may be helpful.

-CXR ([**2183-11-19**]) - In comparison with study of [**11-16**], the patient
has taken a slightly better inspiration and the monitoring and
support devices have been removed except for the left subclavian
catheter. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure,
though this is substantially decreased from the previous study.

-Video swallow ([**2183-11-21**]) - Aspiration with thin liquids. For
complete report, please see speech and swallow note in OMR.

Brief Hospital Course:
60M with chronic systolic CHF (EF=25%), T2DM who p/w AMS,
bilateral opacities on CXR.

# Metabolic encephalopathy -  Most likely result of hypoglycemia
and subsequent pneumonia.  Unlikely from stroke given normal
head CT and lack of focal deficits.  He was weaned off
midazolam, but remained significantly altered. He has had
prolonged delirium with benzos in the past. He was started on
seroquel 50mg TID with little improvement. His sedation was
switched to Precedex with relatively little change. Extubation
was attempted [**11-12**] but the patient was very altered and
agitated, eventually requiring re-intubation. With time his
mental status improved, and after extubation [**11-16**] his mental
status had cleared. Seroquel was stopped.  We held additional
sedating medications and MS improved.  He was noted to have
periods where he was sleepy while on the floor, this usually
occurred after he didn't wear CPAP overnight and improved when
he was compliant with this therapy.

# Septic shock - Most likely [**2-12**] pneumonia, ? community acquired
vs. aspiration.  He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics,
levofloxacin/cefepime/vancomycin.  His medication was dosed
renally and for CVVH.  He underwent bronchoscopy on [**11-6**] which
showed thick purulent sputum.  Urine legionella was negative.
BAL grew only yeast, which was not treated as the patient is
immunocompetent. Patient was treated for 8 days and abx were
stopped. He subsequently had a fever but was hemodynamically
stable. Cultures were negative. His R IJ was replaced by a PICC
line. The patient was afebrile x72hrs prior to leaving the ICU.
On the floor, he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.

# Multifocal pneumonia -  Differential includes community
acquired vs. aspiration.  He was covered broadly with cefepime,
vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Treated for total of 8 days given
the severity of his pneumonia, as above. Speech and swallow
after extubation found that he could eat normal solids and
nectar pre-thickened fluids.  Re-evalution with a video swallow
showed silent aspiration of thin liquids.  At [**Month/Year (2) **], he has
only been cleared for nectar thick liquids and will need further
assessment by sp
