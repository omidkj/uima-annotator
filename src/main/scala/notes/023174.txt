History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old male with CML s/p allo stem cell
transplant [**9-/2121**] c/b chronic GVHD of liver/lung/gut, O2
dependent bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis,
presenting with hypoxia. Of note, he has had multiple recent
admissions for pneumonias, as noted in PMHx below. He was seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (onc) on [**8-24**] and noted to be having increased
dyspnea. He was discharged home from a rehab facility the day
prior to admission, and was noted by his wife to be weak and
tired with a poor appetite. The next am, he took off his
baseline oxygen to go to the bathroom and had 5 episodes of
diarrhea, which he had been having at the rehab facility as
well. He felt very short of breath coming back from bathroom;
brother-in-law reports he was ashen-looking and shaking, and
sounded congested. Visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 13431**] [**Last Name (Titles) 30712**] to 78% on
2.5L; after nebs, he was saturating at 82%. After calling Dr. [**Name (NI) 30713**] office, the nurse practitioner advised patient to be
evaluated in ED.
.
In the ED, O2 sat improved with NC, but he then became more
hypoxic and somnolent with CO2 retention, resulting in
intubation. CXR showed LLL infiltrate and labs reveaked WBC of
8.7 with 33% bandemia. He was given vanc, pip-tazo, and cipro
and 3L IVF. His SBP remained 80s-90s (baseline reportedly 100),
so a CVC was placed and norepinephrine was started. Labs also
showed troponin elevation with normal CK and EKG. BMT service
was made aware and requested stress dose steroids; 60mg
methylprednisolone was given in the ED. Vitals prior to transfer
were: afebrile 95/65 90 15-20 93-94% on 60% FiO2.
.
On the floor, the patient is intubated but alert and able to
follow commands. He denies any complaints, including pain or
trouble breathing. Full ROS is limited by his intubated status.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He is approximately 2.5 years status post
allo SCT from an unrelated donor for CML. His last bone marrow
biopsy was done in [**1-/2122**] and was consistent with remission
from CML. PCR has been negative for BCR-ABL.
.
In terms of chronic GVHD, he has had chronic abdominal
discomfort since transplant that is thought to be associated
with GVHD. He last underwent enteroscopy in [**8-/2122**], which
showed abnormal mucosa in the jejunum, normal mucosa in the
duodenum, and erythema in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis. These areas were biopsied showing chronic
inflammation in the antral mucosa and focal active enteritis in
the duodenum and jejunum. In [**11/2122**], his GVHD progressed with
skin rash and liver function abnormalities. His skin rash
resolved on increased immunosuppression and he is now left with
some hyperpigmentation and telangiectasia over areas of his face
and back. His liver function tests have been intermittently
elevated and his immunosuppression has been titrated along with
this. He was on photophoresis for approximately one year for
GVHD management. He also has had persistent bilateral lower
extremity edema that has limited his ambulation but it is
unclear as to whether this is a GVHD manifestation or not. He
has undergone his 3rd cycle of Rituxan for GVHD.
.
In terms of other post-transplant complications, he has had a
total of four compression fractures since the beginning of [**2122**]
at T8, T9, T11, L1, and L3. This has caused chronic pain. He was
offered vertebroplasty by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**], who follows him for this
condition, however, this was never done. He was seen by
endocrine and received a dose of 5 mg of Reclast in 5/[**2122**]. He
has been on chronic pain medication for the back pain, as well
as the abdominal discomfort. He was on anticoagulation for a PE
diagnosed in [**3-/2123**] and this was stopped in [**9-/2123**] as he had
received 6 months of anticoagulation and was also at risk for
falls. He was again noted for PE at the end of [**10/2123**] and a DVT
in [**12/2123**] and is currently anticoagulated with lovenox.

Social History:
On disability, was a manufacturing manager. Quit tobacco 12 yrs
ago. Smoked 1 ppd x 10 yrs. No etoh or drug use. Previous mj
use. He states that about one year ago he was able to ambulate
independently, but prior to his recent hospitalizations, had
been using a walker.  It has been some time since he was
ambulating.  He has never been married and has no children but
has a very strong support system. He has a group of 5 male
friends who he has known since childhood who are a huge source
of support (they have done multiple fundraisers in his honor
since his diagnosis of CML, for example).  He also has many
local siblings who are very involved in his life and care. For
the past several years, he has lived on and off with his sister
and HCP, [**Name (NI) 717**] [**Name (NI) 23227**] and her husband at their home in [**Name (NI) 5289**].
He owns a condominium in [**Hospital1 189**], MA where he lived independently
up until one year ago; this is now rented out while he resides
with his sister when not in the hospital or rehab.
