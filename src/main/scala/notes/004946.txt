CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic renal failure and metabolic
acidosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency (with a
baseline creatinine of 2.1 to 3), type 2 diabetes, bilateral
staghorn calculi, and presumed diastolic dysfunction,
peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation now
being transferred from Medical Intensive Care Unit to the
Medicine Service following treatment for acute-on-chronic
renal failure with anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Per report, the patient was evaluated by primary care
physician on [**1-3**] for markedly decreased urine output
and increased lower extremity edema and swelling times
several days.  No chest pain.  No shortness of breath.
Decreased oral intake.  Of note, the patient was in the midst
of completing a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin starting on
[**12-17**] for Klebsiella cellulitis.

On Emergency Department evaluation on [**1-3**], the
patient was found with a blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
of 156 and 5.1 and had a fractional excretion of sodium that
looked to be prerenal in etiology.  The patient received
Levaquin, Lasix, and normal saline in the Emergency Room and
had a bicarbonate which was decreased from 16 to 6 with a pH
on arterial blood gas of 7.16.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with a Renal consultation and was started
on aggressive fluids and bicarbonate drip.  In the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, a renal ultrasound was without
significant hydronephrosis.  She continued to receive
aggressive hydration, and her creatinine improved to 4.6,
while a repeat arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.28, and
her chemistries showed a bicarbonate which had increased to
20.  She continued to be followed by Renal and was
recommended to be transferred to the floor with continued
gentle intravenous fluids with continued bicarbonate
repletion.

of 2.1 to 3).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Russian-speaking female.  A
former computer technician who lives alone in [**Location (un) 745**] and
claims to be highly independent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   At the time of
admission her vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.4
degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 132/80, her heart
rate was 60, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen
saturation was 96% on room air.  In general, she was an
obese, elderly, Russian-speaking female sitting comfortably
in bed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
significant for upper palate with dentures.  Difficult to
assess jugular venous distention secondary to a large body
habitus.  Cardiovascular examination revealed first heart
sound and second heart sound with a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the left sternal border.  Pulmonary examination
revealed bibasilar crackles (right greater than left) about
one quarter to two thirds of the way from base.  Abdominal
examination revealed positive bowel sounds.  Ecchymosis in
the right lower quadrant.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Extremities showed bilateral upper
extremity edema.  Left lower extremity with a bandage.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Her white blood
cell count was 8.2, her hematocrit was 28.7 (down from 32.5),
and her platelets were 221.  Chemistries revealed her sodium
was 139, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was
20, blood urea nitrogen was 149, and her creatinine was 4.6
(down from 4.8 and 5.1).  Her calcium was 6.3, magnesium was
2.7, and her phosphate was 12.2 (down from 13.8).  Her INR
was 2.6.  Her albumin was 3.1, aspartate aminotransferase was
23, alanine-aminotransferase was 44, her lactate
dehydrogenase was 167, her alkaline phosphatase was 213, and
her total bilirubin was 0.2.   Most recent arterial blood gas
was 7.28/41/87.  She had a lactate of 0.8.  Her
thyroid-stimulating hormone was 1.6.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Her renal ultrasound (as
mentioned above) showed minimal left-sided hydronephrosis at
3.4 cm X 3.6 cm X 1.5 cm cyst within the upper pole of the
right kidney.

She had an echocardiogram on [**1-5**] which showed an
ejection fraction of 60%, tricuspid gradient of 42 to 47,
with moderate pulmonary hypertension, dilated left and right
atrium, mid symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal
left ventricular cavity size, mildly dilated aortic root, 1+
to 2+ mitral regurgitation, and moderate 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with acute renal
insufficiency and metabolic acidosis.  Given the degree of
her acidemia with a pH of 7.16, she was initially transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she received
aggressive hydration with bicarbonate supplementation.  By
the time of her transfer to the Medicine Service, her
creatinine had shown slow signs of improvement and her
acidosis seemed to be much improved from admission, as her
bicarbonate had increased from 6 to 20.

The exact etiology of her renal insufficiency remained
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 227**] her recent use of antibiotics and several
eosinophils in the urine, there was concern for an acute
interstitial nephritis.  It was also felt that possibly the
patient could have been severely prerenal with a recent
decrease in her oral intake and being on a diuretic.  There
was also concern that the patient may have a degree of renal
artery stenosis.  Finally, there was concern given her
history of calculi that the patient may have some type of
postobstructive renal insufficiency.

Further review of her initial renal ultrasound, however, did
not indicate significant left-sided hydronephrosis.  Given
that the patient was ineligible for magnetic resonance
imaging given a pacemaker, it was decided that she may
qualify for a follow-up ultrasound as an outpatient for
further evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis and
re-evaluation of hydronephrosis.

While on the floor, the patient was given gentle intravenous
fluids with bicarbonate.  Her urine output increased
