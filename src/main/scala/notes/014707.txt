[**2106-12-25**]:
Right axillobifemoral bypass graft with 8-mm ringed PTFE
(polytetrafluoroethylene), Bilateral 4-compartment fasciotomies.

[**2106-12-30**]:  Left groin exploration with direct graftotomy for

History of Present Illness:
68M who experienced sudden onsent back pain beginning this
morning and called his son who brought him to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **].  Patient
reports was in usual health until pain began, described as
center
of back and non-radiating.  Denies associated symptoms such as
chest pain or shortness of breath.  Upon arrival to ED, noted to
have a systolic BP of 212; a bedside ultrasound was positive for
descending aortic dissection.  Also noted on initial exam was a
differential in pedal pulses, with left foot palpable and right
foot only detectable by doppler.  He was started on esmolol gtt
and a CT-A of the torso was obtained which demonstrates a type B
aortic dissection from the descending arch to the iliac
bifurcation.  The majority of the dissecton appears to be
thrombosed and all mesenteric vessels arise from true lumen.

After the addition of nitroglycerin and morphine, the patient's
blood pressure decreased to 140s and he reported decreased pain.
He was admitted to the [**Name (NI) 1106**] service in the CVICU.

Pertinent Results:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2106-12-25**]
11:04 AM
IMPRESSION: Extensive type B thoracic and abdominal aortic
dissection. The
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] comes off the false lumen, but [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territory receives
retrograde flow from the SMA via the marginal artery of
[**Doctor Last Name 23128**].

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT Study Date of [**2106-12-27**] 3:30 PM
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed on both carotid
arteries due to
lines in place. The right-sided system cannot be well evaluated.
Common
carotid artery showed no dissection and no tardus waveforms. On
the left,
velocities are 102 in ICA. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.2. This is
consistent with no stenosis.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2107-1-3**] at 6:46:29 PM      FINAL

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. A
mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with
an intimal flap/aortic dissection. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. No
evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities. No evidence of
dissection of the ascending aorta.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2107-1-12**] 3:45 PM
CONCLUSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process. Mild
white matter
hypodensities, likely sequelae of chronic ischemic small vessel
disease.

1. Type 1 endoleak at the proximal end of the endovascular
aortic stent
without intramural hematoma, pseudoaneurysm or extension of
dissection. The right axillary femoral and bifemoral grafts are
patent.
2. Non-obstructing bilateral intrarenal stones the largest of
which measures 7 mm in the left mid pole.
3. Small-to-moderate nonhemorrhagic left-sided pleural effusion.

4. Pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema without
visualization of stones is likely related to fluid status.
Gallbladder dilation to 3 cm is unchanged from [**2106-12-25**].
5. Fullness of the bilateral collecting systems and fully
distended urinary bladder may be related to hydration.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented for an emergent repair of the type B aortic
dissection. He was taken emergently to the OR and initially the
right axillary to bilateral femoral arteries bypass was
performed. Four days following the bypass the TEVAR was
performed with the intention of improving perfusion through the
true lumen of the descending aorta.

neuro: Patient was initially intubated and sedated following the
first operation and remained intubated for 10 days. The
intubation was prolonged secondary to delirium. There was a
concern for uremia with the BUN in the range of 90 - 100 despite
adequate urine output. Patient's sedation was weaned and
stopped. The hemodialysis was initiated. Patient became
responsive, he was off all sedatives and he was successfully
extubated.

The pain was controlled initially with narcotics and in the past
week only with acetaminophen. Patient report back pain in the
mid and lower back primarily. The pain responds to hot packs and
partially to acetaminophen. We have been avoiding narcotics for
concern of any mental status effects. At discharge, patient is
alert and oriented x 3. He is appropriate.

CV:
Patient presented with Type B Aortic Dissection from the
descending thoracic aorta to the iliac arteries bilaterally. The
right axillary to bilateral femoral arteries bypass was
emergently preformed in order to safe perfusion to legs. The
mesenteric vasculature as well as the renal was well perfused.
Patient creatinine continued to rise. There was concern for
decreased flow to the renal arteries thus TEVAR was performed.
Patient tolerated both surgeries well. The CT scan of the torso
was repeated on [**2107-1-17**]. It showed enlarged diameter of the
thoracic portion of the aorta. No operative interventions were
indicated. The TEVAR was stable.

Patient was resuscitated with fluids and did not require
vasopressors. He became severely hypertensive shortly following
his second operation. The hypertension was controlled with
metoprolol, clonidine and hydralazine as well as nicardipine
infusion. At discharge the systolic blood pressure is in the
range of 120s-130s with only oral regiment. Patient is in
regular rhythm.

pulm:
Patient was intubated for 10 days. This was complicated by
Serratia pneumonia, which was pan sensitive. Patient was treated
appropriately. He received vancomycin and meropenem between
[**1-6**] and [**1-13**]. Between [**12-29**] and [**1-6**] patient was treated with
vancomycin and cefepime. At discharge patient is on room air and
does not have any outstanding pulmonary issues.

GI: Patient did not suffer any injury to bowel. Shortly after
his second operation Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed and tube
feeds were started. Patient was started on regular diet once his
mental status improved and there were no
