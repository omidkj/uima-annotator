History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year old man who was found at the bottom of a
flight of stairs after last being seen that afternoon.  He was
awake and responsive,though unable to speak or move his right
side.  EMS responded, and the patient was taken to an OSH where
he was intubated for airway protection and a CT scan was
performed showing a 2 cm left hemispheric subdural hematoma.  He
was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

He was administered 10 mg vitamin K, weight based profilline,

[**9-5**] CXR: Portable chest radiograph was obtained with patient
positioned
semi-upright. The endotracheal tube tip resides approximately
3.7 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left upper
quadrant. There is mild left basilar plate-like atelectasis.
There is subtle nodular opacity projecting over the right upper
lung which could represent costochondral calcification though
the possibility of a true pulmonary nodule is difficult to
exclude. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
unremarkable.  Old left-sided rib fractures are noted.

[**9-5**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Large left hemispheric subdural
hematoma with 13 mm of rightward shift of midline structures,
not significantly changed from the OSH study.

[**9-6**]: CT head: IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of large left
subdural hematoma with persistent 12 mm of rightward subfalcine
herniation, extensive pneumocephalus, but no new sites of
hemorrhage.

[**9-6**] CT head: FINDINGS: Patient is status post left-sided
craniotomy for subdural evacuation with extensive pneumocephalus
and hyperdense subdural collection once again visualized.
Improvement of rightward shift of approximately 7 mm of the
normally midline structures. No right-sided hemorrhage or new
foci of hemorrhages are seen. No infarction or edema is seen.

[**2157-9-7**] MRI Cervical spine: No signs of ligamentous disruption
or acute trauma to the cervical spine identified. Chronic
compressions of T4 and T5 vertebral bodies are noted. No
abnormal signal within the spinal cord or intraspinal hematoma.
Multilevel degenerative changes.

[**2157-9-7**] CT head
Minimal change since the examination at 12:01PM. No new
hemorrage or large
vascular territorial infarct detected. No new mass effect.
Improved moderate pneumocephalus.

[**2157-9-8**] CXR
Interval extubation. Unchanged left lung basilar atelectasis

[**2157-9-8**] CXR
Appropriate Dobbhoff line placement

[**2157-9-8**] EEG: left temporal slowing, no epileptiform waves

[**2157-9-10**]: CT head noncontrast: Stable left subdural collection
status post left craniotomy

[**9-11**] portable CXR: Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
appearance. Subtle heterogeneous opacities in the left mid and
lower lung have been somewhat waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] for serial
radiographs since [**2157-9-6**] and could potentially be due
to aspiration considering the clinical suspicion for this
entity. Minor atelectasis is present at the right lung base.

[**2157-9-12**] KUB: A nasogastric tube is seen traversing the stomach
with angulation of its distal portion, with its tip most likely
in the body of the stomach (post pyloric location of the tip is
felt less likely due to the horizonal course of the distal
portion of the tube). There is a nonspecific gas pattern. There
is no free air. There is a screw seen in the right femoral head.
There are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.

[**9-12**] portable CXR:

[**9-12**]: Lower extremity dopplers: Negative for DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 3827**] was taken for emergent craniotomy on [**9-5**] for
evacuation of acute left sided subdural hematoma.
Postoperatively he remained intubated and was transferred to the
ICU for frequent neuro checks and systolic blood pressure
control less than 140.  Postoperative head CT demonstrated good
evacuation of clot with postcraniotomy pneumocephalus for which
he was maintained on 100% FIO2 for 24 hours.  Wound care was
consulted for evaluation of his right shoulder and trochanter
wounds/ulcers from his initial injury. They made dressing
recommendations and will continue to follow.

Repeat Head CT on [**9-6**] demonstrated improved midline shift and
the patient's exam improved significantly.  He started to follow
commands in all extremities except for the right arm however he
did demonstrate antigravity strength in the right arm.  He
remained intubated in order to obtain an MRI of his cervical
spine to rule out ligamentous injury.  MRI was performed
overnight on [**9-6**].  It showed no signs of ligamentous
disruption, acute trauma to the cervical spine or signs of
spinal cord injury and subsequently on [**9-7**] the cervical collar
was removed.

The patient's exam continued to improve and on [**9-7**], POD 2, and
the patient was extubated.  He developed some agitation in the
evening and was unable to follow commands and was mroe
dysphasic.
CT head was repeated and there was no new hemorrhage. The
pneumocephalus was resolving. He required 0.5 mg ATivan for the
CT imaging. He was also given morphine for tachycardia in the
event that this was pain related. This helped with HR and
behavior for about 2 hours. He was then again agitated and
tachycardic and Haldol was given prn.

On [**9-8**], patient was more lethargic on examination, but
following simple commands. His morphine dosing was decreased and
he was transferred to the step down unit. Speech and swallow
evaluation was unable to be completed due to patient
participation and patient will require a dobhoff.

On [**9-9**] he was placed on continuous EEG monitering for rule out
seizure in the setting of persistent lethargy.  This showed no
epileptiform waveforms but left temporal slowing.  Neuro exam
was unchanged.  He had an episode of tachycardia associated with
a SBP of 168. This resolved with one dose of  Metoprolol 5gm IV.
Dilantin level was 8 with an  albumin level of ***

On [**9-10**] his corrected dilantin was 7.6 and so he received 500mg
IV dilantin bolus.  Noncontrast Head CT was stable.  Digoxin
level was 0.5.  His neurological exam remained stable.

On [**9-11**] he was able to get OOB to chair with max assist.  FS
blood sugars were stable ranging 130 to 150 and RISS was
discontinued.  Tube feeds were advanced to gaol at 70.
Corrected dilantin level 10.2.  As patient remained seizure
free, 24 hour EEG monitering was discontinued.  The patient
developed tachypnea and coarse Lung sounds on [**9-11**] into [**9-12**].
Portal CXR demonstrated increased interstitial markings
indicating fluid overload.  He responded to a one-time dose of
Lasix 20mg IV with improved breathing and urinary output of 2
liters.  He pulled out his NG tube and a Dobhoff tube was
replaced, confirmed to be in the stomach by
