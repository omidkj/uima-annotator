Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, tachypnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with past medical history of CAD s/p
CABG, s/p [**Age over 90 1291**], presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with fever.
History was obtained from patient.

Per patient, she was in her USOH until a few days ago when she
started to feel fatigued with decreased appetite and lack of
energy. She reports that she may have had an episode of
diarrhea, and she developed shortness of breath and a cough
productive of trace amounts of phlegm. A nurse at her [**Hospital 4382**] facility ([**Street Address(1) 19127**] [**Hospital3 400**]) advised her that
she come to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 101.7, HR 104, BP 159/78,
RR 26, satting 87% RA. O2 sats came up to mid 90s on 6L by nasal
cannula. WBC count was 24.5 with 95% polys, no bands. Lactate
was 2.6, increased to 2.9 at time of admission. UA negative.
Creatinine was 1.3 up from 0.9 in [**2129-12-6**]. CXR consistent
with R sided pneumonia in addition to pulmonary edema. Patient
was given tylenol, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin.
She got 2L IVFs. No hypotension. She was admitted to the MICU
for persistant tachypnea.

Of note, patient was admitted in [**2129-12-6**] for treatment of
C dificile colitis in the context of antibiotic use for RLE
cellulitis. She completed a 14-day course of metronidazole and
reports that her overall health since then has been fine.

On review of systems, patient denies chest pain or pressure,
lightheadedness or dizziness, headache, stiff neck, or
photophobia. She denies abdominal pain or cramping, rash or new
joint pain. Remainder of ROS is per HPI above.

STUDIES:
.
Admission EKG: Artifact is present. Sinus tachycardia. There is
a late transition which is probably normal. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave changes, although ischemia
or myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the
previous tracing atrial ectopy is less.
.
CXR ([**5-6**]): IMPRESSION: Heart failure. Confluent opacity in right
infrahilar region may be confluent edema, however concurrent
pneumonia cannot be excluded. Recommend repeat radiography after
appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.
.
TTE [**5-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion
and transvalvular gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-3-17**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. The
other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
A [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with history of [**Age over 90 1291**], CAD s/p CABG, PAF, diastolic
CHF, now presenting with fever, leukocytosis and respiratory
distress, admitted to the MICU for persistent tachypnea.

# Respiratory distress/tachypnea. Suspect pneumonia given
fevers, leukocytosis, focal RLL infiltrate on CXR, and rather
acute onset of symptoms. Other considerations include pulmonary
edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction versus acute coronary
syndrome. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative. BNP,
although elevated, was down from prior. Her symptoms were felt
to be most consistent with pneumonia. She was treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and her
symptoms improved. On the second hospital day, her tachypnea was
improving and her oxygen requirements decreased. She was felt to
be stable enough for the floor and was transferred out from the
intensive care unit. Her antibiotics were changed to
levofloxacin. Her respiratory status remained stable, with only
mild expiratory wheezes. She was transferred to a rehab center
with instructions to complete a fourteen day course of
levofloxacin, for her pneumonia as well as her bacteremia (see
below). Her discharge meds also included ipratropium and
albuterol nebulizers.

# Bacteremia: One blood culture from admission labs came back
positive for STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE, sensitive to
levofloxacin. A pulmonary source was presumed. TTE showed no
vegetations, but they could reportedly not be ruled out, due to
suboptimal study. Surveillance blood cultures were negative. She
will be treated with levofloxacin for a total of fourteen days.

# Hypotension. Previous discharge summaries note systo
