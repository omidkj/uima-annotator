Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
unremitting chest pain and abd pain out-of-proportion to exam

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Small intestinal resection


History of Present Illness:
This was an 80-year-old man who
entered the hospital with a 1-day history of abdominal
discomfort. He had a known history of chronic bilateral chest
discomfort of which he also complained. He underwent an
initial CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a small
amount of free fluid, but no other obvious abnormality. It
was suggested that he had a larger amount of small intestine
than expected lateral to the ascending colon, potentially
suggestive of an internal hernia. The initial CT scan was
done without oral contrast. It had been performed in the
context of a CT angio of the chest to rule out aortic
dissection or embolus. His initial lactate was 1.1. A few
hours later while being observed, he complained of increased
pain. The lactate was found to be 4.8. A repeat CT scan with
contrast now showed an increased amount of free abdominal
fluid. He appeared to have an area of small bowel which was
somewhat dilated and thickened. Although his feeding vessels
were normal, the possibility of ischemic colitis, perhaps on
a mechanical basis such as a volvulus or internal hernia,
could not be discounted. Exploratory laparotomy was suggested
to the family and accepted by them.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2152-1-7**] 1:57 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS

Reason: eval aorta
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man with unremitting CP/ab pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval aorta
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Unremitting chest pain and abdominal pain, please
evaluate the aorta.

COMPARISON: [**2147-9-3**].

TECHNIQUE: CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to
evaluate for aortic dissection was reviewed. Multiplanar CT
reformations were obtained and reviewed.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no evidence for dissection. The
heart and great vessels of the mediastinum are unremarkable. The
lungs are clear. The pleura are normal. The soft tissues are
unremarkable. The thoracic aorta is calcified secondary to
atherosclerotic disease. The bronchi are patent to the
subsegmental level.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is an abnormal edematous loop of
small bowel in the right mid/upper quadrant with associated
edematous mesentery. There is also some trace free fluid in this
area. This abnormal loop of bowel lies lateral to the ascending
colon, and its superior mesenteric artery feeding branch has a
stretched appearance. This finding may represent internal small
bowel hernia. The remainder of the small bowel appears normal.
The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal. The
nephrograms are normal, but the expiratory state cannot be
evaluated. There is nonspecific non- pathologically enlarged
lymphadenopathy.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Rectum, sigmoid colon, and large bowel
are unremarkable. The descending colon lies medial to the
abnormal loop of small bowel. There is no free fluid in the
pelvis. The prostate is enlarged. The bladder is normal. There
is no lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: There is no evidence for fracture. Soft tissues
are unremarkable.

CT REFORMATIONS: The reformations again demonstrate no
dissection but an abnormal small bowel loop in the right
mid/upper quadrant.

IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal edematous small bowel loop within the right
mid/upper quadrant susspicious for internal hernia with edema
(R/O strangulation - closed loop obstruction or volvulous)
Surgical consult is recommended. These findings were discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of the study.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2152-1-16**] 11:00 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: r/o PE.
Field of view: 38 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man POD 9 SB resection, fever, received CT Abdomen
today on which there was a concern for possible PE.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PE.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 80-year-old man postop day 9, status post small bowel
resection, fever, received CT abdomen today where there was a
concern of PE.

COMPARISON: [**2152-1-7**] chest CTA and [**2152-1-16**]
abdominal CT.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the chest were obtained
without and with IV contrast. 100 cc Optiray. Multiplanar
reformatted images were obtained.

CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: A filling defect is
observed in a left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary artery and
extending into three of the branches consistent with pulmonary
embolism. No other pulmonary emboli are observed. The heart,
pericardium, and great vessels are stable, with coronary and
aortic calcifications again noted. Prominent mediastinal lymph
nodes are stable in appearance and calcifications are seen in
some of the nodes. There is no hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Associated dependent and bibasilar atelectasis is observed. The
visualized portions of the upper abdome
