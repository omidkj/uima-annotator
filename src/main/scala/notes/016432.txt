Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ceftriaxone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85 yo female with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recurrent
UTIs who presents from an assited living facility with cough
productive of green sputum and shortness of breath. She had a
UTI about 2 wks ago that was was treated with a macrolide.  She
was placed on maintenace dose antibiotics 3x/wk.  Six-seven days
prior to admission, she developed a cough.  She felt weak and
subjectively febrile the next day an dher PCP started her on
Azithromycin.  She took this for 3-4 days wihtout improvement in
symptoms, and was then started on moxifloxacin.  On Monday, she
started to feel better, but today had worsening SOB, wheezing,
and increase work of breathing.  She called EMS who found her
with a Sat 88-89 on RA, 91% on [**4-25**] L and 95-96 on NRB.

In the ED, initial VS: 100.8 125 124/96 30s Sats 91 on 4L, which
came up to 96 % on a non-rebreather with RR 25-30s.  Her CXR
showed multi-focal pneumonia.  Her lungs were somewhat wheezy.
She was treated with albuterol, ipratropium, CeftriaXONE 1gm,
Oseltamivir 75 mg, and levofloxacin 750mg, Vancomycin 1gm.  She
did not get IVF.  Blood cultures were sent.  Prior to transfer,
VS 99.6 HR 96 BP 139/60 RR 24 Sat 99/NRB.  While awaiting a bed
in the ICU and after receiving all her antibiotics, she noticed
a new rash on her legs.  This was warm but not itchy.
.
In the ICU, she was breathing comfortably on a NRB.
.
ROS: Denies chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,
rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria.

Pertinent Results:
MICRO:
[**2162-12-29**] BCx: no growth
[**2162-12-29**] UCx: contaminated
[**2162-12-30**] Influenza A&B negative; culture negative
[**2162-12-30**] MRSA screen: negative

EKG on Admission: Sinus tach @ 100, LAD, tall r-waves, Q in I,
avL, V2-4, no ST-T wave changes.

EKG [**2163-1-1**] Normal sinus rhythm. Leftward axis at minus 22
degrees. Q waves in leads I, aVL and lead V1 with tall R wave in
lead V1. The tall R wave in lead V1 may be related to altered
lead placement. Consider left atrial abnormality. The Q waves in
leads I, aVL and V6 are narrow and non-diagnostic but deep.
Consider possible lateral wall myocardial infarction. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2162-12-29**] the current changes in the
precordial leads may be related to altered lead placement. No
other diagnostic interval change.

[**2162-12-30**] CXR (portable):
As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are
increased, as a consequence, the pre-existing opacities have
decreased in extent. No newly appeared focal parenchymal
opacities, no evidence of pleural effusions. Tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
without signs of pulmonary edema.

ECHO [**2162-12-31**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade
I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild diastolic LV dysfunction.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Elevated left ventricular filling
pressures and mild pulmonary hypertension.

CT CHEST [**2162-12-30**]: Pulmonary nodules, the largest is 8.8 mm in
the left upper lobe with lower lobe predominant bronchial wall
thickening and bronchial mucus plugging with atelectasis most
likely due to recent infection or inflammation, followup CT
thorax is recommended in three months following antimicrobial
treatment to assess for resolution and interval change in the
left upper lobe nodule. Diffuse coronary artery, aortic valve
and mitral annulus calcification. Moderately large hiatal
hernia. Air in the gallbladder may be due to previous
sphincterotomy, clinical correlation is advised.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course [**Date range (3) 108618**]:
In the ICU, she was easily weaned from non-rebreather face mask
and was put on 4L NC with good oxygen saturation. Vancomycin and
levofloxacin were continued, but given rash, ceftriaxone was
stopped and she was started on tobramycin. Influenza A&B were
negative and tamiflu stopped. Given concern for macrobid or
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a CT was ordered. ECHO ordered to
evaluate for cardiac pathology given pt has some orthopnea out
of proportion to whats explained by CXR.
.
Floor course [**Date range (1) 108619**]:
#. Dypsnea/cough: Vancomycin and tobramycin stopped as pt was
afebrile. Influenza negative as above. [**Month (only) 116**] have also been due to
bronchospasm/bronchitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (new
surroundings with carpet/rugs/curtains) given imaging findings
and nebulizers greatly helped symptoms. She was treated with
levofloxacin course for pneumonia and given nebulizers at
discharge.
.
# Rash: Unclear which antibiotic was culprit, but Ceftriaxone is
most likely cause given tolerating quinolone recently and
rareness of Vanc allergy. Per pt, rash significantly improved
during hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension: Thiazide initially held, restarted at discharge.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Aspirin/statin
.
# Urinary sx/stress incontinence: continued home oxybutynin
.
# Insomnia/anxiety: Pt has some anxiety, increasing since death
of her husband, which contributes to her subjective dyspnea. She
was given low dose lorazepam during hospitalization given that
benzos, infection and hospital setting can precipitate delirium
in the elderly. She was discha
