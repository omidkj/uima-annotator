Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, diffusely tender.

Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
[**5-15**] RUQ U/S: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute
cholecystitis.

[**5-16**] CTA Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Nonenhancement consistent
with necrosis involves the body and neck region of the pancreas
with significant peripancreatic stranding and fluid, some of
which extends into the left anterior pararenal space. No gas
within pancreas or and no discrete fluid collections. Thrombus
is present within the SMV distally and near the SMV portal vein
confluence.
2. 3.4 cm heterogeneously enhancing left renal mass, highly
concerning for renal cell carcinoma. Left renal cysts. Probable
tiny right renal cysts.\
3. 1.9 cm right adnexal cyst.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions

[**5-20**] MRCP:
1) Necrotizing pancreatitis.
2) Near-occlusive thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein,
progressed since [**2191-5-16**].
3) Left renal mass with appearance consistent with renal cell
carcinoma.
4) Pancreas divisum.
5) Bilateral renal cysts

[**5-26**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Evolving pseudocyst(s) in the location of previously
visualized necrosing pancreatitis changes, with interval
increase in superior mesenteric vein thrombus.
2. Persistent enhancing left renal cortical mass, highly
suspicious for renal cell carcinoma.
3. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions with
associated lower lobe collapse.
4. New diffuse subcutaneous edema.
5. Redemonstration of an incompletely imaged right adnexal cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72820**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in the SICU for care for her necrotizing pancreatitis.  For her
SMV and splenic vein thromboses, she was placed on a heparin
drip with a goal of 60-80 seconds for PTT.  An arterial line was
placed to more accurately follow her blood pressures.

Meropenem therapy was initiated for her necrotizing pancreatitis
on HD3 and a PICC line was placed.  TPN was initiated.
Cardiology was consulted for rapid atrial fibrillation on HD4.
She was treated with diltiazem.

On HD9, she was given Coumadin to begin transitioning to a PO
anticoagulation regimen.  She required a Neosynephrine drip to
maintain her blood pressure.  However, on HD10, she was
intubated for respiratory failure.  Her Neosynephrine drip was
weaned to off.  Her TPN was stopped, and tube feeding was
initiated via [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-jejunal tube.  Neosynephrine was
reinitiated to maintain her blood pressure.

On HD14, she had another bout of atrial fibrillation and was
placed on an Amiodarone drip.  On HD 15, her pressors were again
weaned to off.  On HD 17, she was extuabed.  Her heart rhythm
had converted to sinus on amiodarone and diltiazem.  Active
diuresis ensued.  On HD18, she passed her speech and swallow
evaluation and began to tolerate PO feeds.  On HD19, she was
transferred to the floor.

On the morning of HD21, after missing 2 doses of PO amiodarone,
she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.  She was given IV
diltiazem with no effect.  She was then transferred to teh SICU
for an amiodarone bolus and drip.  She converted back to siunes
rhythm and was transferred to the floor on HD22.  At this time,
she was not therapeutic on Coumadin, and her doses were
adjusted.  She tolerated a regular diet and tube feeds were
stopped.  On HD24, her Foley catheter was removed.  She was
noted to have an INR of 2.0 on HD26.

On HD28, she was deemed ready for discharge home.  She is to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks with a CT scan.  She
should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].  She should
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2429**], her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 766**] to discuss
management of her coumadin and amiodarone.
