History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo woman with hx charcot [**Doctor Last Name **] tooth,
osteogenesis imperfecta, COPD who presented to [**Hospital3 17162**] medical
center on [**6-20**] after fall, was found to have multiple rib
fractures and subsequently developed PNA and ARDS.   Initially
in the ED, she was found to have multiple non-displaced L sided
rib fractures involving [**4-23**] posterolaterally and 8 through 11
posteriorly, as well as a LLL consolidation.  She was admitted
to the medicine floor and treated for PNA and pain control.  She
developed AMS thought [**1-18**] hypercapnia and subsequently developed
worsening respiratory failure with CXR showing worsening
bilateral consolidations requiring ICU transfer, bipap and
eventually intubation.  She was broadend to Zosyn, levo, vanc,
then subsequently changed to zosyn/linezolid for unclear
reasons.  Course was complicated by ARF thought to be [**1-18**] ATN
and hypotension not requiring pressors.  Plans were made for
bronchoscopy and dialysis today, however family requested
transfer to tertiary medical center for further evaluation.  She
was transfered on fent/versed.

On arrival to the floor, pt is intubated, sedated on
fent/versed, opens eyes to voice.
