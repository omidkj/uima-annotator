History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 87M w/PMH myelodysplastic d/o, ESRD
on HD who presented from [**Hospital3 2558**] Skilled Nursing Facility
with fevers and weakness for 3-4 days. The patient reports he
had a fall approximately 4 days ago hitting his chest and left
leg, however he cannot remember if hit his head. This episode
occurred in the setting of him bending over to pick up his
pants, and he did not experience dizziness or vertigo. He
received dialysis [**5-28**] in [**Location (un) **] as scheduled, and was
rescheduled to get an additional session of UF [**5-29**] for extra
fluid removal. His blood pressures after dialysis [**5-28**] was
110/56 his baseline after dialysis. He was brought to the ED
from [**Location (un) **] over concern of his increased weakness and fever,
in the setting of need for follow-up hemodialysis. He states he
has been feeling generally weak but denies chills, chest pain,
cough, dysuria, headache shortness of breath, or difficulty with
bowel or bladder.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 100.8 HR 98 BP 128/56 RR 20-24 O2
98% RA. He was found to be moderately unresponsive, had
decreased lung sounds bilaterally, and had 4 cm x 3 cm ulcer
over his left shin. Labs were significant for WBC 73, Hct 27.8,
trop 0.2, proBNP > [**Numeric Identifier **], LDH 456, Cr 3.7, uric acid 6.4, and
lactate 3.1. CXR showed cardiomegaly and interstitial opacities
suspicious for congestive heart failure vs multifocal pneumonia.
He was given 1L, vanc 1g, cefepime 1g, levofloxacin 750mg, and
hydrocortisone 100mg. A head CT and pelvic radiograph was
unremarkable. He was admitted for possible emergent
hemodialysis, and evidence of pneumonia/sepsis.

IMAGING:
CT Head [**2193-5-29**]: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or territorial infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are
prominent, consistent with the patient's age.  The basal
cisterns are patent and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  Periventricular white matter hypodensities are most
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  There is
no fracture.  The right posterior mastoid is underpneumatized
and contains some fluid.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and
middle ear cavities are clear.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Findings suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Probably chronic inflammatory change in the right posterior
mastoid.

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT Study Date of [**2193-5-29**] 10:38 AM
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for fracture or dislocation.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2193-5-29**] 10:40 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of fracture dislocation involving the cervical
spine.
2.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes with spinal canal
stenosis, worst at C6-7.
3.  Thickening of apical interlobular septae, suggesting
congestive heart
failure.

DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED Study Date of [**2193-6-1**] 4:16 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Normal testicular echotexture and vascularity.
2.  Multiple epididymal calcifications, which may reflect
sequela of prior infection or inflammation.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Summary: 87 yo M w/ PMH myelodysplastic d/o, CHF, ESRD on HD,
HTN, HLD, aortic stenosis who presents with fever and weakness
for 3-4 days, admitted for multifocal pneumonia.

# Sepsis / pneumonia: The patient presented with elevated WBC
73.9 (94.4% pmns), fever (T 100.8), tachypnea (RR 24), and CXR
that showed interstitial opacities concerning for multifocal
pneumonia vs CHF exacerbation. Other significant labs include
lactate 3.1. He had mild hemodynamic instability (hypotension
90s-100s/40s-60s) without evidence of new end-organ dysfunction.
He was started on a 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime
(starting [**2193-5-29**]) and was transitioned to vancomycin and
ceftazidime, for which he completed a 7 day course. Blood
cultures taken at
