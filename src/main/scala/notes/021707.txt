History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56963**] is a 19 year old who was in his usual state of good
health until 1 week prior to admission when he noted the onset
of malaise at a [**Doctor Last Name **] concert. He went to the golf course where
he works in landscaping the following day but continued to feel
malaise and was sent home whereupon he went to bed. When he
developed fevers, nausea, emesis, cough and dyspnea, he
presented to [**Hospital3 3583**]. There, he had a chest x ray that
showed a right lower lobe infiltrate and a negative head CT and
LP negative for meningitis. Ceftriaxone and zithromax were
started after a follow up CXR showed RLL/ RUL  infiltrates.

Mr. [**Known lastname 56963**] then developed palpitations and a rapid tachycardia
with rates in the 150-200's. 25 mg Cardizem, 15 mg lopressor, 6
mg adenosine, and then 12 mg of adenosine were administered
without success. He quickly decompensated with oxygen
saturations of 90% despite use of nonrebreather and a trial of
CPAP. He was intubated and cardioverted with 50 joules into
sinus tachycardia at 110-120's. He maintained systolic pressures
in the 90-110's and temperature 104. He was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further work up and treatment of his pneumonia and
respiratory distress.

PORTABLE SUPINE AP CHEST: No prior studies are available for
comparison. The endotracheal tube tip is in satisfactory
position in the proximal trachea, 5.5 cm above the carina. A
right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter is present with the
tip in the right main pulmonary artery. The orogastric tube is
looped in the stomach, and the tip is not visualized, off the
inferior film edge. There is borderline cardiomegaly given the
technique. There is hazy increased opacity in the right
hemithorax, which is likely due to a pleural effusion. A small
left effusion is also likely present, layering posteriorly.
There is increased opacity in the right middle lobe as well.
There is left lower lobe atelectasis.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed. There is
normal flow, augmentation, compressibility and waveforms.
Intraluminal thrombus is not identified

transthoracic echo:The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler; however images
were suboptimal. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated. There is mild global right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Pulm: Mr. [**Known lastname 56963**] arrived intubated and sedated. His
respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to fulminant
community acquired pneumonia with acute respiratory distress
syndrome. The patient required aggressive ventilation with
assist control, PEEP of 15, and an FiO2 of 100% at the onset of
his course. He underwent bronchoalveolar lavage with sputum sent
for gram stain and culture. No organisms were cultured and the
fluid was negative for influenza A, B, and RSV by EIA.
Pneumocystis carinii was negative as well. His chest X ray was
significant for persistent perihilar and basilar opacities
likely due to fluid overload, and persistent pleural effusions,
making it difficult to exclude underlying process such as
aspiration or pneumonia. He was started on ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin for legionella, bactrim to cover for PCP and
azythromycin for atypical organisms. His ventilator settings
were quickly weaned and within 3 days, once he produced fewer
secretions, he was extubated. Once his PCP was negative, bactrim
was discontinued. Pt continued to do well on 4L NC and then 2L
NC; on day of discharge, patient was tolerated RA without any
desaturations on ambulation (96%).  He was discharged only on PO
levofloxacin.  He was prescribed 8 days of further antibiotic
treatment to finish a 14-day course in total.

2.  CV: Mr. [**Known lastname 56963**] had a pulmonary artery catheter placed. His
initial readings were consistent with distributive shock and he
was started on neosynephrine. At the outside hospital, his
troponin I was found to be 4.8. His cardiac markers were cycled
here and found to be positive, likely reflecting tachycardia and
DC cardioversion. His EKG showed sinus tachycardia with t wave
inversions in leads V3-V6.  ON admission to the MICU, pt was
started on a diltiazem drip, which he required for only
approximately 12hrs.  On resolution of respiratory failure, pt
remained with normal heart rate and did not convert back to svt
again druing admission.  Likely the cause of his SVT was from
his pneumonia/ respiratory failure and myocardial suppression of
sepsis.  Echo demonstrated normal EF 50% and right ventricle
free wall hypokinesis-- pt will need repeat Echo after
resolution of all respiratory symptoms and sepsis to assure that
cardiac function and movement has returned to baseline.  Patient
was instructed to schedule this through his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 23220**], in
3 months.

3.  Endocrine: Mr. [**Known lastname 56964**] random cortisol and
