   WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered
from the
      site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococcus
      aureus and beta streptococcus).

      BACTERIA.    SPARSE GROWTH.  ? OF THREE COLONIAL
MORPHOLOGIES.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Pending):


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was treated on medical service with IVF for ARF, to
which he responded well with BUN/Creatinine dropping. Several
days after admission he became increasingly febrile and acutely
uncomfortable in the rectal area (WBC increased to 20). Surgery
was consulted and patient was transferred to the surgery service
for incision and drainage of a perirectal abscess (6/23+[**6-10**]).
Cultures from the wound initially grew out enterococcus and
anaerobes, and the wound was negative for MRSA. Several sets of
blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with 10
days of antibiotics, initially levo/vanco and metronidazole,
although treatment was tailored based on repeat cultures. He is
no longer on antibiotics, has been afebrile and wound looks
good. Since drainage, the wound is open, and has been packed
several times/day. THe patient also [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 60594**] [**Last Name (un) **] baths tid.
This care will need to continue until the would granulates,
heals over and closes on its own- something we anticipate will
take time. When he stools the wound needs to be cleaned
(irrigated with NS and repacked with clean gauze).
While the abscess was the main reason for the patient's
admission, several other issues required management while he was
in the hospital. He is IDDM, and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for better
glucose control. Their recommendations will be included in the
discharge instructions and medication lists.
In addition, the patient experienced several episodes of chest
pain, sob. Cardiology was consulted and he was cleared. He ruled
out for MI several times and EKGs showed no acute change. He
remained on telemetry due to his cardiac history the entire
admission, and is known to experience PVCs, sometimes as many as
[**10-4**], while being asymptomatic. This was felt to be
unconcerning to cardiology, unless they occurr in runs similar
to Vtac, at which point (or at any point the patient is
symptomatic) cardiac enzymes should be sent. He has a history of
CHF and his sob was felt to be mostly due to fluid overload
while in the hosptital. At discharge he is felt to be nearly
back to baseline fluid-wise,although he still has significant
atelectasis and an unclear h/o asthma/COPD for which he requires
frequent nebulizer treatment. He needs aggressive chest PT and
to be up and out of bed often as well as a clear eye on making
sure that he does not become fluid overloaded.
In general, He is eating a regular diet and tolerating it well,
and has not needed IVF for over a week. He is usually alert and
oriented, however can become confused at night. We have found
that trazodone qhs is very helpful rather than haldol or some
other sort of sedative. He is an endearing man who unfortunately
will require considerable help keeping his abscess area clean
and un-infected, and we hope that you will be able to help him
as best you can. Thank you.

Discharge Condition:
Good

Discharge Instructions:
Wound Care: Please re-pack the rectal wound with clean, dry
curlex [**Hospital1 **]. Every time the patient stools the wound needs to be
re-packed (with clean curlex), and if there is stool
contamination, the wound needs to be irrigated with normal
saline as well. He also needs [**Last Name (un) **] baths tid.
Finger sticks qid for DM.
Oxygen as needed, prn nebs, and the rest of medications as
listed.

Followup Instructions:
PLease follow-up with the surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] in 2 weeks for
the rectal abscess. Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1538**] in [**12-17**]
weeks (his internist), and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (cardiologist) in a
week or two as well. In-house cardiology recommended TTE be done
on an outpatient basis, and this will need following up on with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
