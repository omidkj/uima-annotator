PERTINENT STUDIES
# TTE ([**2149-7-4**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. LV systolic function appears mildly-to-moderately
depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to
hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. The
basal inferior and posterior walls are thin and fibrotic. The
inferior septum is also hypokinetic. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericard
