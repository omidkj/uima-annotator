HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 72-year-old-male, status
post coronary artery bypass grafting x4 and VSD closure in
[**2143**] using all vein grafts, was transferred in from [**Hospital3 6454**] Hospital after ruling in for myocardial infarction with
elevated CKs to 800 and cardiac cath with the report the
patient had 3 or 4 vein grafts occluded and the 4th graft had
a 90% stenosis.  He was feeling well since his prior
operation in [**2143**] until the evening prior to admission when
he complained of indigestion which was unrelieved by TUMS and
sublingual nitroglycerin x3.  Called EMS and was transferred
to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] emergency room and then onto [**Hospital3 1280**] for
cardiac catheterization this morning.  Following this cath,
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] DMC for consideration of re-do
coronary artery bypass grafting.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  His preop lab work were as
follows:  White count 9.2, hematocrit 45.2, platelet 325,000.
PTT 28, 7.5 and INR 0.99.  Sodium 140, K 4.4, chloride,
bicarb 28, BUN 26, creatinine 1.0 with blood sugar of 157.
ALT 21, AST 18.  Alkaline phosphatase 79.  Total bilirubin
0.9, albumin 3.9.  EKG at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital showed
first-degree AV block.  There was a heart rate of 56 with Q
waves in II, III and aVF and ST elevations in II, III and
aVF.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, he is 5 feet 7 inches tall,
75 kg.  Vital signs were temperature 98.4, heart rate 76 and
first-degree AV block, blood pressure 106/48, saturation 98%
on 2 liters.  He was lying comfortably in bed.  He was alert
and oriented x3, moving all extremities, following commands,
nonfocal exam.  His pupils were equally round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  EOMs are intact.  He was anicteric.
He had normal buccal membranes.  No lesions.  Neck was supple
with no lymphadenopathy and no bruits.  His lungs were clear
bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm with S1, S2,
well healed sternal incision.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with normal bowel sounds and no
hepatosplenomegaly. His extremities are warm and well
perfused, with no edema. He had bilateral saphenous vein
graft harvest incisions which were well healed. He had 2+
bilateral carotid, radial and DP pulses and 2+ left femoral
pulse with a sheath in place in his right femoral artery.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for
consideration of re-do coronary artery bypass grafting and
remained on nitroglycerin, heparin and Integrilin.  He was
also seen by the cardiology fellow who pulled his arterial
and venous sheaths on the morning of the 29th.  His
creatinine drifted down slightly to 0.8.  His exam was
otherwise unremarkable.  Echocardiogram was planned as well
as vein mapping in preparation for his re-do surgery. On
[**5-2**], the patient also had an episode of flash pulmonary
edema, seen by cardiology, and transferred to their service
for preop optimization of his care and also continued to
monitor him while the other preoperative studies were done,
waiting results of vein mapping and carotid ultrasound.

On [**5-3**], he also had episodes of desaturating to 80%, but
then would come back into the high 90s. He denied any
shortness of breath or chest pain at the time. He continued
to metoprolol, ________, aspirin, Captopril, and IV heparin.
His IV Integrilin was turned off.  He also had Lasix diuresis
to help control his congestive heart failure.  The patient
also spiked a temperature to 101.2 on [**5-4**].  He was
cultured.  His potassium dropped to 3.7 and was repleted.  He
also had increase in his AV block at the level of his AV node
and cardiology recommended discontinuing his metoprolol and
any nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] at the time.  All of this was discussed with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of the EP service.  On [**5-4**], heparin was
also restarted.  The patient also had Enterococcus grow out
of his urine culture.  The patient was started on Levaquin
and the Foley was discontinued on the [**5-5**].  The patient was
also seen again by EP and was diagnosed with Wenckebach at a
2:1 block.  Beta blockers continued to be held.  The patient
also had a right lower lobe infiltrate and was also covered
for this with Levaquin.

Preoperatively, the patient had less than 40% stenosis
bilaterally on internal carotid arteries and had antegrade
vertebral flow.  Lower extremity vein mapping showed
bilateral greater saphenous veins present in both thighs and
already harvested from lower extremities which matched his
scars.

On [**5-7**], the patient underwent re-do coronary artery bypass
grafting x2 with vein graft to the ramus, vein graft to the
posterolateral branch of the RV, was transferred to the
cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on a milrinone drip at
0.5 mcg/kg per minute and propofol drip at 20 mcg/kg per
minute.  Postoperative day 1 was significant for complete
heart block.  He was hemodynamically stable, though, with
blood pressure 115/63, saturations 96%.  He had been
extubated overnight.  He remained on milrinone drip at 0.25
and a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.25.  Weaning of those 2 agents
was begun.  His urine output dropped off slightly.
Electrophysiology consult was called again for followup.  On
postoperative day 2, the patient continued in first-degree AV
block.  His case was reviewed again with EP.  He was given
Lasix for diuresis and continued on insulin and Levaquin for
coverage of his pneumonia and also began his aspirin therapy.
It was determined the patient would probably need a permanent
pacemaker, but this could be addressed later in the week.

On postoperative day 3, the patient had stable rhythm
overnight, maintaining good blood pressure.  He had an air
leak in his chest tube the day prior.  Chest tube remained in
place.  He began Plavix therapy and continued on vancomycin
and levofloxacin for perioperative antibiotics.  He continued
his diuresis.  Beta blocker was held and chest x-ray was
taken again on water seal.  On postoperative day 4, his chest
tubes were discontinued and the plan was to go ahead and
bring him back to the cath lab on the following Monday.  On
postoperative day 5, his chest tubes were pulled.  He was
alert and oriented.  His creatinine was 0.9.  He was moving
all of his extremities and working with nurses and physical
therapists.  His pacing wires remained in place given his
first-degree AV block in preparation for possible pacemaker
insertion.

On [**5-12**], he went back to the cath lab with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] for
planned stenting of his left main with a coated stent and
bare-metal stenting of his LAD.  His new vein grafts to this
OM and PLD were both widely patent.  Patient was started on
Plavix which is to remain on indefinitely.  His sheaths were
pulled successfully later in the day.  He remained in AV
block.  On post
