ONC HX:
Pt was initially diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in
[**2099**]. He was treated with external beam radiation until 04/[**2100**].
He did well until [**3-/2103**], when he was noted to have a rise in
his PSA. He was started on Eulexin and Zoladex. He had a very
good response, which lasted for 5-6 years. On [**2108-11-13**], he was
started on mitoxantrone and prednisone [**2-19**] rising PSA. He was
continued on this therapy for 5 cycles and then was started on
secondary hormonal therapy with ketoconazole and hydrocortisone.
[**10-20**] his PSA started rising, suggesting progression of disease
on hydrocortisone and ketoconazole. His PSA has continued to
rise this year going up to 98 [**2111-3-17**] and bone scan at the
time showed slightly increased uptake at T10, but no evidence of
mets. CT thorax showed stable lung nodules, adrenal adenoma, fat
stranding of left psoas muscles possibly c/w metastatic disease
and mildly enlarging infrarenal AAA. He was then admitted in
[**4-/2111**] for back pain and was found to have an L3 lesion
concerning for metastases and he was started on XRT. In the
interim, he was also continued on Zoladex. In [**7-/2111**], he was
restaged following the completion of his XRT. Between [**7-22**] and
the present he has been continued off of all therapies except
for Lupron and had been doing well including weaning himself off
of all pain medications. However, his PSA again began to
elevate, most recently 172 in 9/[**2111**].
