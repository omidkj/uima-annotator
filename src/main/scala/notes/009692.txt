Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening hypoxemia, odynophagia and fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
63-year-old Italian speaking woman with metastatic
adenocarcinoma of lung on home O2, metastases to distal bones
(shoulder/foot) as well as spine (C5 compression) and brain, s/p
XRT, never on chemotherapy who presented to the hospital after
having increasing oxygen requirement at home and worsening
fatigue.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with diplopia
which was felt to be due to leptomeningeal involvment and XRT
was initiated along with dexamethasone.  Her biomarkers from
pathology were pending at time of discharge, thus no treatment
was initiated.  She had a persistent lactic acidosis of [**6-15**],
atributed to cancer. At time of discharge, she did have
recurrent, non-productive cough.  Please refer to d/c summary
for details of her course.

Since leaving the hospital, she has had progressively worsening
weakness, anorexia, throat pain and fatigue.  Her O2 use has
increased from 2L at rest to 4.5L to maintain O2 sats in low 90s
and last week she developed a more productive cough with yellow
sputum, no hemoptysis.  She completed XRT last week and her
family anticipated that she would get better, however, given the
worsening overall status and after discussion with her
oncologist, a decision was made for an evaluation.  She was
initailly taken to [**Hospital1 487**] Gen. Hospital, where, she underwent
a CXR that showed a right pleural effusion, was given a
nebulizer, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiothoracic
evaluation.

In [**Hospital1 18**] the ED, initial VS were: 96.6 126 110/62 24 91% 4L.
Labs were notable for Lactate of 8.5, WBC of 13K, Plt 68, HCO3
of 15 and AG of 22 and GLu of 308, PMNs of 91%, BUN 28 and
bacteriuria. She underwent CT chest which showed peribronchial
opacities and a large consolidation in the RML, RLL lobe c/w PNA
and atelectasis as well as impaction of multiple bronchi w/
trace right sided pleural effusion.  She was seen by CT surgery
(no intervention given metastatic disease) and IP who suggested
she may require a thoracentesis.  She received 1NS, cefepime and
5mg of morphine IV.

VS on transfer: 97.7F 130/74 116 91% 4L 22. Patient appeared ill
but comfortable.  She was coughing and complainig of a sore
throat.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, otherwise notable for worsening weakness and now
essentially inability to ambulate.  No urinary incontinence or
retention, she has had persistent constipation.  Odynophagia
unchanged.

(-) Denies fever.  Denies headache, rhinorrhea or congestion. No
wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations.
Denies abdominal pain, dark or bloody stools. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.


Past Medical History:
- Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (Cytology on bronchial washings
of poorly differentiated non small cell carcinoma), Dx early
[**Month (only) **]
- WB XRT completed [**5-30**] ([**2188**] cGy over five fractions)
- s/p XRT to C5 [**5-13**] - [**5-16**]
- HTN


Social History:
Lives at home with husband and three sons.  [**Name (NI) **] at home mother.

Family History:
No FHx of malignancy, lung CA.  Mother passed away from diabetic
complications. Father passed away from liver complications.


Physical Exam:

HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM but significant ulceration of both
lips, some ulceration on the tongue and some thrush posteriorly,

Neck: supple, JVP 10cm, no LAD
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2 with some ectopy, no
murmurs, rubs, gallops, pulsus 8mmHg
Lungs: No accessory m. use, faint breath sounds 1/2 up the
right, unable to assess for egophony due to sore throat, CTA on
the left.
Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no
organomegaly, echymosis on the LLQ
GU:  foley
Ext: Warm, well perfused, trace edema


Brief Hospital Course:
63-year-old Italian speaking woman with metastatic
adenocarcinoma of lung on home O2, metastases to distal bones
(shoulder/foot) as well as spine (C5 compression) and brain, s/p
XRT, never on chemotherapy who presented to the hospital after
having increasing oxygen requirement at home and worsening
fatigue. She passed away on [**6-7**].
.
Hypoxemic Repiratory Failure:  Likely due to worsening lung mass
and/or post-obstructive collapse/pneumonia (incr. cough
frequency and sputum production). The patient did not have
fevers but has been on steroids. She was ruled out for PE with a
CTA. Oncology consulted on the patient and indicated that there
is nothing left to offer her for therapy of the cancer. The
patient's respiratory rate continued to increase and she had
increasingly labored breathing. A family meeting was held with
the patient's husband and three sons. The patient's goals were
discussed as well as the lack of therapeutic options. Based upon
that discussion and the patient's wishes, the goals of care were
shifted to maximize her comfort. At 9:45AM on [**2200-6-7**] she passed
away peacefully with family at the bedside.
