Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 4007**]

DATE OF ADMISSION:  [**2185-2-16**].

DATE OF DISCHARGE:  [**2185-3-17**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left upper quadrant abdominal mass.

HISTORY  OF  THE  PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a pleasant
70-year-old  male  who was referred from the [**Hospital 3340**] Clinic
in   [**State 108**]   for   management  of  a  malignant  peritoneal
mesothelioma.  He complained of early satiety and weight loss
over a six-month period.  He was evaluated in [**State 108**] to have
a  very  large left upper quadrant mass.  Percutaneous needle
biopsy was done at that time, which showed it to be malignant
mesothelioma  of  the  peritoneal  cavity.  Metastatic workup
revealed that the patient did not have any spread of disease.
However,   he   continued  to  accumulate  ascites  requiring
multiple paracenteses.

The  patient  was  referred  to  the Surgical Service here in
conjunction  with  the oncology service for management of his
malignant mesothelioma.

PAST  MEDICAL  HISTORY:    History is significant for a small
hiatal hernia, and hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zestril.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL  HISTORY:    The patient is a retired food broker.  He
quite  smoking  cigarettes  35  years  ago.   He has no known
asbestos exposure.  He drinks occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:    Examination revealed the following:
The  patient  is  a  cachectic-appearing,  thin  male  with a
protuberant  abdomen.    Neurological  examination was within
normal  limits.    The  HEENT  exam was within normal limits.
Sclerae  were  anicteric.   The oropharynx was normal.  NECK:
Neck  did  not  revealed any palpable lymphadenopathy.  Chest
was  clear.    HEART:  Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm
with  no  murmurs,  gallops  or  rubs.  ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was
soft,  but  distended,  nontender.    There was palpable left
upper  quadrant mass that was quite sizeable.  He appeared to
have  ascites  on physical examination.  Groin did not reveal
any palpable lymphadenopathy.  EXTREMITIES:  Extremities were
normal  without  edema.    He  had  palpable  distal  pulses.
RECTAL:  Examination was guaiac negative with no masses.

LABORATORY   DATA:      Admission   laboratory  revealed  the
following:   The patient's admission electrolytes were within
normal  limits.    BUN  and  creatinine were 13 and 0.7.  The
white  blood  cell  count  was  14.4.    Hematocrit was 33.7.
Platelet  count  was  647,000.  Admission PT was 13.8 and the
PTT  was  34.4.   He had an ESR that was 122.  The albumin of
was  2.4.    The EKG showed sinus tachycardia with borderline
LVH  and  some  minor  T-wave abnormalities.  Chest x-ray was
within normal limits.

HOSPITAL  COURSE:    Brief  hospital course:  The patient was
admitted  to the Surgical Service for preoperative evaluation
for  resection  of  his  malignant  mesothelioma.    He had a
central  line  placed  by  the Surgical House Staff and began
total  parenteral nutrition almost immediately.  In addition,
he  was  encouraged to eat until his operation was scheduled.
He  underwent  a  helical  CAT  scan,  that  revealed a large
heterogenous  mass  that  involved  multiple  loops  of small
bowel, stomach, spleen, left lobe of the liver.  In addition,
the  patient  was noted to have a moderate amount of ascites,
as  well as lymphadenopathy.  During the preoperative period,
the  patient did require a radiologic guided paracentesis for
symptomatic  ascites.    Once  he was adequate rehydrated and
received  approximately a week of total parenteral nutrition,
he  went  to  the operating room and underwent an exploratory
laparotomy  with  resection  of  this mass and debulking with
Argon beam coagulation.

The  mass  was  noted to be adherent to the transverse colon,
therefore, a transverse colectomy was performed.  However, it
was  peeled  off  the stomach, small bowel, and the abdominal
wall.    The Argon beam was used to debulk some of the tumor.
A peritonectomy was not performed.

The  immediate  postoperative  course  of  this  patient  was
uneventful.   On a postoperative-line change, access was lost
and   upon   re-inserting   a  central-venous  catheter,  the
patient's  sustained  a  left pneumothorax.  This was treated
using   a   radiologically-placed  left  chest  tube.    This
pneumothorax   resolved   spontaneously.    The  patient  was
transferred  from  the  ICU  to the floor, where he recovered
fairly  nicely.  He began to resume bowel function.  However,
on  postoperative  day  #8,  when  the  patient  was awaiting
transfer  to  a  rehabilitation  facility,  he became acutely
shortness  of breath, manifested signs of peritonitis and had
a  leukocytosis  into  the  40,000  range.    He was urgently
transferred  to  the  ICU  and  re-intubated  for respiratory
failure.  The patient had an abdominal CAT scan that revealed
fluid  in  the  abdomen, consistent with an anastomotic leak.
Discussion  was  undertaken with the family whether or not to
proceed  with  a  re-operation.    Initially,  the family was
reluctant,  given  the  patient's  advanced stage of disease.
However,  after approximately a week of managing this patient
in the Intensive Care Unit using percutaneously placed drains
and intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy, it was clear that the
patient's sepsis was not going to resolve without laparotomy.

During  this  time,  the patient was placed on broad-spectrum
antibiotic  and antifungal therapy.  However, the respiratory
status  continued  to worse and it was clear that the patient
was  in  septic  shock.    He  was intermittently on pressors
during this time.

Due to the patient's critical condition, and the fact that he
was  not  improving  with an anastomotic leak on nonoperative
therapy,  the  family  was  reapproached and the decision was
made  to  take  this  patient  back to the operating room for
urgent diversion.

On  [**2185-3-7**] the patient was taken to the operating room and
explored.      The   significant  findings  at  the  time  of
re-exploration  were  that  the  anastomosis  had  completely
dehisced.  The edges appeared pink, suggesting that there was
too much tension on the anastomosis.  The proximal end of the
colon was simply brought up as a colostomy and matured to the
skin.    The  distal  end was stapled off as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pouch.
The  belly was washed out with copious amounts of irrigation.
The  drainage  catheters were exchanged for sterile catheters
to   continue  antibiotic  irrigation  in  the  postoperative
period.

The  patient's  postoperative  period  was  quite  [**Male First Name (un) 3928**].  He
continued  to  manifest  signs  of  sepsis.  Although, he did
initially  experience  some  improvement,  he  had  continued
respiratory  failure  with  subsequent pneumonia while on the
ventilator.    He  was  extubated for a brief period of time,
however,  he  required  reintubation.    Given  the patient's
significant  state  of critical illness, the fact that he had
multiple   nosocomial  infections,  and  not  improving,  and
especially  in  light  of  his  advanced state of malignancy,
discussion  was  entertained  with  the  family  to  withdraw
support.   The family did not want to see Mr. [**Known lastname 8260**] suffer any
further and, therefore, made the decision to make the patient
comfort-measures  only.    The  patient  expired on [**2185-3-17**]
after support was withdrawn.
