Pertinent Results:

[**8-13**] MRI brain: Findings consistent with hypoxic ischemic injury.

repositioning of the right sided chest tube.  Tiny residual left
sided pneumothorax
[**8-12**] CT head: grey white matter differentiation has become less
distinct.  Marked increase in subcutaneous swelling likely
secondary to volume resuscitation with unchanged right parietal

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 43M firefighter who was directing traffic at the
scene of a motor vehicle crash on [**2148-8-10**], and was hit by high
speed passing car.  He suffered multiple injuries including a
near-amputation of right arm, severe bilateral leg fractures, as
well as head trauma. He arrived to the ED in vfib arrest, and
was successfully resuscitated after 28 minutes.  The patient was
intubated, and had bilateral chest tubes placed in ED. He was
taken to the operating room emergently for exploration of his
right upper extremity degloving injury, external fixation of
bilateral lower extremity fractures, bolt placment, and
revascularization of left lower extremity with harvest of
saphenous vein from right as well as bilateral fasciotomies.  In
the operating room the patient also underwent an exploratory
laparotomy for a tense distended abdomen and falling blood
pressure.  By hospital day 2, when the patient returned from the
operating room, he was hemodynamically stable and remained so
throughout his hospitalization. However, his traumatic and
anoxic brain injury caused profound neurologic injury portending
an extremely poor prognosis. During his extended stay, the
patient underwent numerous procedures and diagnostic tests.  The
following summarizes his course by system:
.
Neuro:
[**8-11**] On the day of admission a cranial bolt was emergently placed
with an opening pressure of 21, but without good wave form.
[**8-12**] CT scan: Showed loss of grey white matter differentiation
[**8-13**]: The bolt was removed. He had an MRI that day that showed
findings consistent with hypoxic ischemic injury; no evidence of
hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury, however the radiologists also
reported a tiny focus of signal abnormality in the left thalamus
could potentially relate to a focus of non-hemorrhagic [**Doctor First Name **].
Of note, the patient suffered from convulsive and non-convulsive
status epilepticus from approx [**8-14**] until [**9-11**].  He was placed on
continueous EEG monitoring from [**8-25**] until [**9-13**].  To arrest his
seizures, he required a phenobarbitol coma while optimizing
anti-seizure mediations. He required an array of anti-seizure
medications.  Numerous attempts were made to withdraw
pentabarbitol before he was able to ween without return of
seizures. He was weaned off Pentobarb completely on [**9-9**].  On
the day of discharge, he was requiring several anti-seizure
medications including dilantin, depakote, Topamax, and Keppra.
.
Pulmonary:
The patient was emergently intubated in ED.
[**8-27**]: The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy tube
insertion.
[**9-10**]: The patient was weened to trach mask
On the day of discharge, the was on on mechanical ventilation:
assist control (volume targeted(Tidal volume 600 cc  rr 14, PEEP
5  FIO2 40%  ween to PSV as tolerated
.
Cardiovascular:
In the initial resuscitation, the patient recieved multiple
units PRBC.
[**8-27**]: The patient underwent placement of a right femoral vena
caval filter
After the initial resuscitation, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.
.
GI:
On [**8-27**], the patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy.
Nutrition: The patient's current tube feeding regimen is as
follows - Nutren pulmonary full strength with Beneprotein 40
gm/day at rate of 65 mL/hr.  Check residual q4hr, and hold
feeding for residual >100 mL. Flush with 200 mL water q6hr
.
Skin
On [**9-9**], it was noted that the patient was developing a sacral
decubitus ulcer (superficial level 2).  We treated this with
close wound site monitoring, continuous placement on KinAir air
matress throughout hospital course with meticulously frequent
positi
