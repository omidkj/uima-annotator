PERTINENT IMAGING STUDIES
PORTABLE CHEST, [**2106-9-12**]
FINDINGS:
Since the prior study, there is mildly increased prominence of
the central
pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive failure.
There has also been development of small bilateral pleural
effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis. Valvular prosthesis is
present. Heart is mildly enlarged. Aorta is calcified.

[**2106-9-16**] COLONOSCOPY
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

[**2106-9-16**] EGD:
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**2106-9-17**] ABDOMINAL U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearing hepatic hemangiomas with no new focal liver
lesion
identified.
2. No varices identified.
3. Patent hepatic vasculature.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE [**9-11**] - [**2106-9-12**]:
==============================
1. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: [**Month (only) 116**] be upper GI bleed from gastritis
or PUD, suggested by dark stools, or lower source such as
diverticular bleeding, though she has never had this before on
prior colonoscopies. Refused NG lavage, though likely not brisk
upper GI bleed given overall stability.  Transfused 2 pRBCs with
appropriate bump in Hct. 2 PIVs.  GI consulted and plan for
EGD/Colonoscopy for Tuesday. Pt currently on clear liquid diet.
Hemodynamically stable during ICU stay.

2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Sinus rhythm on admission.
Continued amiodarone. Held coumadin given likely EGD/[**Last Name (un) **].

3. Valvular Disease: Given her slow bleed and s/p MVR/AVR, she
merits anticoagulation between 2.5-3.5. Coumadin held on
admission. Monitored INR. Once INR < 2.5, will need heparin gtt
until EGD/colonscopy.

3. Urinary Tract Infection: Pt was on cefpodoxime at rehab x 3
days. Urine culture from NH pending.  UCx here pending.  Changed
to IV ceftriaxone with plan for 4 more days. Started pyridium
for bladder spasm.

4. Hypoxia: Pt desaturates off of nasal canula, but promptly
improves with 1-2 L to 100%. [**Month (only) 116**] be related to volume overload,
amiodarone (has been on over 10 years). CXR did not show
effusions, but ? infiltrate in RML.  Did not start abx given no
fever, leukocytosis, cough.

5. Hip Fracture: Continue PT as tolerates

6. Chronic Diastolic CHF (EF>60%): Held standing lasix given
GIB, though may need additional lasix between transfusions if
she becomes more hypoxic.  Continued carvedilol.

7. Hypothyroidism: Continued LT4

# DISPO: To Medicine Floor on [**2106-9-12**]

MEDICINE FLOOR COURSE: [**9-12**] to [**2106-9-20**]
HOSPITAL COURSE:
89 y/o female with recent hip surgery, mechanical valves and PAF
on warfarin with guaiac positive stools and acute blood loss
anemia.  Was transferred from the ICU to the Medicine floor on
[**2106-9-12**].  A brief description of her hospital course is
organized according to problems below.
.
# UGIB / Acute Blood Loss Anemia.  Was difficult to tell if the
melena/ +guaiac in the setting of anemia was an upper GI bleed
from gastritis or PUD (suggested by dark stools) or a lower
source such as diverticular bleeding (though she has never had
this before on prior colonoscopies). She refused NG lavage. On
HD6, her INR was decreased to <2.0 and she had upper and lower
endoscopies to further evaluate the bleeding source yesterday.
She was found to have Grade I-II esophageal varices which GI did
not believe to be the cause of her bleeding.  No other possible
causes were found.  She had not required further PRBC
transfusions and her Hct was stable, so GI believed she could
have further work-up as an outpatient.  They recommended
considering a capsule study and will discuss this with her at an
outpatient appointment that has been made.
.
# Esophageal varices: GI found Grade I-II esophageal varices on
EGD.  She had an abdominal U/S to look for a cause.  U/S found
stable hemangiomas of the liver and no blockage of splenic vein.
 No further management or imaging was deemed necessary.  She had
LFTs tested and these were found to be normal as well.
.
# pAF on Warfarin: Patient presented in sinus and was
anticoagulated on warfarin at home.  Her amiodarone was
continued.  See below for a description of her anticoagulation
course.  Her INR was 2.6 on day of discharge.

# Valvular Disease: Patient
