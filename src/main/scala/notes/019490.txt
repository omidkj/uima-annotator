Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12122**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of
hypertension, PVD, 2nd degree AVB, CVA, and chronic renal
insufficiency who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab on
[**1-12**] after an admission for urosepsis. He was gradually
recovering his strength, but approximately 3 days prior to this
admission he developed a mild, productive cough. However, per
the nurses at his rehab his lungs sounded clear; thus, he was
discharged as planned from rehab to his daughter's home on
[**2104-1-23**].

At home, Mr. [**Known lastname 12123**] cough worsened. The night prior to
admission he lay awake with coughing fits. PO intake was
unchanged (he voraciously ate lamb chops for dinner). The
morning of admission, he continued to cough, feel SOB, and VNA
noted T 100.4. Thus, he was referrred to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS T 100.4, HR 50, BP 158/43, RR 24, O2 83%
on RA, improving to 96% on NRB. Exam was notable for crackles at
the lung bases. Labs were notable for an improving creatinine,
stable Hct, and lactate of 3.5. CXR showed possible RML
infiltrate. He was given levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, cefepime 2G
IV x 1, and vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 as well as 1L NS and admitted
to the MICU for further evaluation and treatment.

On admission to the MICU, patient complains of feeling thirsty
and of mild SOB when he talks. He states that his cough has
improved considerably since arrival at the hospital. He denies
chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, urinary symptoms,
change in mental status, or light-headedness. Review of systems
was otherwise negative.

Imaging:

is low likelihood of pulmonary embolism.

after fluid resuscitation is demonstrated
[**2104-1-24**]  CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Calcified pleural
plaques.

Brief Hospital Course:
A [**Age over 90 **] yo man with multiple medical problems presents with hypoxia
and fever, most likely an acute on chronic process.

# Intermittent hypoxia: The patient was admitted to the ICU and
treated for pneumonia initially with vancomycin, cefepime, and
levofloxacin given his intial precarious respiratory state. He
improved quickly and so cefepime was discontinued on the second
MICU day. Since MRSA screen [**2104-1-25**] was negative, vancomycin was
discontinued.  Prior to discharge, patient was afebrile for
several days with non-produtive cough. Gauifenesin was added to
his medical regimen. At his time of discharge, the patient was
sating well in mid-high 90's on RA at rest and high 80s to low
90's while ambulating with occasional sats in the mid-80s. A
7-day course of levofloxacin was completed today [**2104-1-31**]. Given
a somewhat unclear etiology of hypoxia, a V/Q scan was done to
rule out pulmonary embolism. The V/Q scan revealed a low
likelihood of PE although did show signs of emphysema. His CXR
also showed plaques consistent with asbestosis exposure. He was
therefore scheduled for outpatient pfts shortly after discharge
as well as 2L NC to be used as needed with ambulation. His
albuterol was continued and we asked that he talk with his PCP
at his upcoming appointment about additional medications that
may be used to manage his lung disease depending on his PFT
results.

# Hypotension on admission: Borderline low blood pressure on
admission was likely due to pneumonia. Blood pressure quickly
improved after IVF in the ED. His antihypertensives were held.
By the time he was transferred to the floor, his SBP was in the
140s and his atenolol was restarted with normotension for
several days prior to discharge.

# Normocytic Anemia: No definitive etiology but HCT stable at
recent baseline of 25-28. He had normal iron studies and a
normal ferritin. Stool guaics were negative and patient was
without clinical evidence of bleeding. With CKD and low retic
count, most likely a result of low production state. We asked
that the patient follow up with his PCP for further management
planning.

# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 40-45% on recent TTE. No
signs of volume overload on exam or by CXR on admission. On an
ACEI and BB.

# Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine improved since
discharge to baseline. Stable at 1.2 at time of discharge. There
is a poorly defined renal lesion see on ultrasound. Patient will
follow up with outpatient urology to discuss management and
treatment of this lesion.

# Gout: Patient experienced right big toe pain around the MTP
joint. Patient was started on colchicine in the hospital.

# Status post stroke: with residual right-sided weakness.
Aggrenox was continued during this admission.

# Coronary Artery Disease: No evidence of ischemia on admission.
 Statin was continued.  ACEI and beta blocker were held while
hypotensive and restarted when blood pressured stabilized to the
140s.

# History heparin sensitivity:  Heparin SC at reduced dose was
started for DVT prophylaxis. PTT was followed.

# CODE: Patient and his daughter affirmed his desire to be
DNR/DNI and no invasive lines or procedures.
