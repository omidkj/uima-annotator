Date of Birth:   [**2112-7-6**]       Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10208**] was delivered at
37-6/7 weeks weighing 3010 g and was admitted to Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit from Labor and Delivery for respiratory

blood group, antibody negative, received RhoGAM at 20 and 28
weeks, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, rapid plasma reagin
nonreactive, Rubella immune, afebrile, with rupture of membranes
seven hours prior to delivery.  She had chronic abruption
observed in house early in her pregnancy.
Spontaneous vaginal delivery .  Apgar scores were 8 and 9.  He
received blow-by oxygen only.  He was transferred to the Newborn
episode in the newborn nursery at about 3 hours of life.
Measurements revealed birthweight 3010 g (which was the 50th
percentile), length of 50 cm (which was the 75th percentile), and
a head circumference of 33.5 (which was also the 50th
percentile).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed a pale, pink, nondysmorphic male with palate intact.
Bilaterally equal breath sounds.  No murmur.  In respiratory
distress.  The abdomen was soft and nontender with a 3-vessel
cord.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Back and spine were normal.
Hips were stable.  Red reflex was present.  Anterior fontanel
was open and flat and molding of the head was also noted.

The child was placed on CPAP for respiratory support.  He also
received a bolus of IV normal saline for poor perfusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  RESPIRATORY:  Intubated after around 12 hours of
life and received one dose of surfactant for persistent
respiratory distress and oxygen requirement, self- extubated
within the next 12 hours and remained on CPAP since then.  He was
taken off CPAP to nasal cannula on [**7-11**].  He remained
intermittently tachypneic and on nasal cannula oxygen until [**7-13**]. By [**7-14**] he was oxygenating well in room air except with
bottle feeding. Spent 24 hours nursing exclusively with no
desaturations prior to discharge.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:   No murmurs.  No issues.  Blood pressure
was stable.

3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  He was initially started
on D-10-W at 60 cc/kilo per day, and the first set of
electrolytes were sodium of 143, potassium of 3.6, chloride
of 107, and bicarbonate of 22.  Feedings advanced once
respiratory status stabilized.   Difficulty oxygenating with
bottle feeds prior to discharge as noted above.  Currently, he is
breast feeding ad lib; parents counseled re: feeding cues,
expected frequency/duration of feeds, signs of milk transfer.
Discharge weight 2835 g (4.5% below birthweight).

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He received ampicillin and
gentamicin for seven days based on respiratory distress and
prolonged distress, presumed pneumonia. The complete blood count
showed a white blood cell count of 17.9 (73 neutrophils and 2
bands).  Blood cultures remained negative.

5.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  He is on full feeds and tolerating
them.  No abdominal distention.  Blood sugar has been stable.
The initial bilirubin was 6/0.3 on day two, peaked at
15.8/0.9 on day five and responded well to phototherapy, down to
9.7/0.7 day six at which time lights were discontinued with a
rebound of 7.6/0.4 on day seven. His blood group was A negative,
and Coombs was negative.

6.  NEUROLOGICAL:   No issues.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  His initial hematocrit was 51, and a
platelet count of 299.  WBC diff as noted above.  Pink and well
perfused at discharge.

8.  GENITOURINARY:  Underwent circumcision [**7-14**] with subsequent
suture placement by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] for persistent bleeding a
few hours later.  Wound/suture site is clear without sign of
infection or bleeding at discharge.


Passed hearing screen in both ears.  Passed car seat test.
Received hepatitis B vaccine [**2112-7-14**].  State screen sent per
routine.

Discharged home in stable condition with parents, to follow up
with primary pediatrician Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3450**] in [**Location (un) **] on [**2112-7-16**] at
10am.

Discharge diagnoses:

1.  Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
2.  Presumed pneumonia, resolved.
3.  Status post sepsis evaluation with negative blood cultures.
4.  Exaggerated physiologic hyperbilirubinemia, resolved.
