Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization, Stent placement, Intra-Aortic Balloon
Pump placement and removal, swan placement and removal.

History of Present Illness:
56 y/o female with a h/o hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH
on the AM of [**2131-10-7**] with 10/10 substernal and left-sided chest
pain, radiating down the left arm. Per patient, she noted the
onset of SSCP Friday AM at work. The pain lasted for about an
hour and resolved without any intervention. Was not associated
with any SOB or other symptoms. Subsequently, on Saturday
afternoon, she again developed the same SSCP, this time
radiating to her left arm, associated with nausea. Denied
associated SOB. Pain persisted until Sunday AM when she finally
presented to the OSH. EKG there revealed STE in V2-V4. She was
given SL nitro x 3, Lopressor 5 mg IV x 3, ASA, Plavix loaded,
heparin bolus + gtt, and integrillin bolus + drip. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] urgently for cardiac catheterization.

In the cath lab, she was found to have a totally occluded
proximal LAD. She had two stents placed to her LAD. She then
became hypotensive and was resuscitated with IVF. An IABP was
placed along with a femoral Swan.

Upon arrival to the CCU, she was hemodynamically stable and
chest pain free. She had no complaints.

5. Insertion of IABP with improvement of cardiac output.

ECHO [**2131-10-9**]:
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the anterior wall, anterior septum and apex and
mild hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mild to moderately depressed
(LVEF= 40 %).  The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally.Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
No AS, AI, trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) 11718**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11719**] thickened but no

Brief Hospital Course:
56 y/o female with hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain
and found to have a STEMI [**12-30**] to an occluded LAD.

STEMI: Pt presented with chest pain and found on cath to have
occluded LAD. Occlusion was stented but pt required IABP
placement for cardiogenic shock (cardiac index of 1.3)
indicative of cardiogenic shock and requiring IABP.  ECHO
confirmed large anterior infarction and severe LV dysfunction.
Pt required IABP for several days, at which point she was weaned
and IABP and swan removed. Pt did not have any furthur
complications including mechanical or arrhythmic. She did have 2
episodes of chest pain thought to be either noncardiac or
secondary to reperfusion which responded to NTG and were not
associated with EKG changes or further enzyme leak. She
tolerated the addition of ASA, plavix, high dose statin, lasix,
ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker, titrated up as tolerated by MAP
and pt's symptoms. On discharge pt's SBP were consistently in
the 80s, without any symptoms of lightheadedness or dizziness
and this was deemed acceptable as pt will be unlikely to mount
higher BPs given her large MI. Pt was also started on
anticoagulation with coumadin given the large area of infarct
and akinetic/hypokinetic anterior/apical wall. She will need
close monitoring of her INR.

TOBACCO ABUSE ?????? Pt counseled extensively by team and social work
about smoking cessation.

ANEMIA - Pt's hematocrit dropped from admission (39) to
discharge (26). This was thought to be initially due to some
blood loss from cath, and frequent blood draws. There was no
sign of active bleeding and pt remained asymptomatic. Pt was not
transfused and stool guaiac was not checked as pt did not have
any bowel movements.  Pt was asked to follow up with her PCP for
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] Hct check.

HYPERLIPIDEMIA - Pt was switched to high dose statin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a heart attack. You had a
drug-eluting stent placed in your coronary artery (left anterior
descending) to open up the blockage in your heart. You were
started on several new medications including aspirin and plavix.
You must take these medications daily because they keep your
stent open. Do not stop this medication unless directed by your
cardiologist only. You were also started on a medication called
warfarin. This medication is a blood thinner to prevent blood
clots. You will need to have blood test to monitor your warfarin
level.

You were started on the following medications:
Aspirin 325 mg daily (prevent future heart att
