Date of Birth:   [**2159-5-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for CAD, status post
MI in [**2192**] with an ejection fraction of approximately 20-30%
who was admitted on [**2196-1-13**] for an elective
catheterization to evaluate worsening fatigue, exertional
angina, and heart failure.  The catheterization demonstrated
no occlusive CAD, increased biventricular filling, decreased
cardiac index at baseline, but improved cardiac index on
milrinone infusion.  The patient refused to continue this as
an outpatient.  TTE on [**2196-1-14**] showed severe global
hypokinesis, apical akinesis.  Recent laboratories
demonstrated increased creatinine.  The patient states that
since that admission he has been feeling worse with increased
lightheadedness, nausea.  He had decreased urine output the
day prior to admission with no urine output the night prior
to admission.  The patient admits to occasional cough, chest
pain, shortness of breath.  He states his usual weight is
approximately 145 pounds.  At this presentation, he is
148-149 pounds.

While in the Emergency Department, the patient received
Zofran, 1 liter of fluid, 10 units of insulin, and 30 mg of
Kayexalate for an elevated potassium.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  History of cocaine and alcohol abuse.

[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who he would like to make decisions in the event that
he would be unable to.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes, CVA in his mother
at a young age.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  96.6, heart
rate 96, blood pressure 95/45, respiratory rate 18,
saturating 100% on room air.  General:  The patient was lying
in bed, in no apparent distress, occasional nonproductive
cough.  HEENT:  The oropharynx was with moist mucous
membranes, no thrush.  The pupils were equal and reactive to
light, muddy sclerae.  Lungs:  Clear anteriorly to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Sinus, no murmurs,
positive S3.  Abdomen:  Active bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no organomegaly appreciated.  Extremities:
Without edema.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.6, hematocrit
39.2, platelets 215,000, no bands, 79% neutrophils.  Sodium
131, potassium 7.7, chloride 79, bicarbonate 28, BUN 148,
creatinine 6.6, glucose 84.  PT 12.8, PTT 25.9, INR 1.1.
Digoxin level pending as were CK, MB, and troponin.  ALT 65,
AST 60, alkaline phosphatase 252, T bilirubin 0.8, amylase
244, lipase 248.

The chest x-ray showed no infiltrate, no evidence of failure.
AICD in place.

The EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 61, normal intervals,
normal axis.  Poor R wave progression, flipped Ts in V2
through V6 without peaking of the T waves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 36-year-old male with
decompensated CHF, status post MI in [**2192**], admitted with
acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.  In order to evaluate
the patient's volume status, a right femoral line was placed
with a PA catheter to monitor wedge and monitor his cardiac
index and output via Fick.  The patient was continued on his
Coreg and aspirin.  His Lasix and Zaroxolyn, as well as
Lisinopril were held.  If the patient was in low output
failure, milrinone was to be considered.  In addition, the
patient was placed on a sodium-restricted diet as well as a
1.5 liter per day fluid restriction.

Based on the acute renal failure, the renal team was
consulted.  A phena was obtained which was 1.4% on Lasix
which suggested prerenal state and poor perfusion of the
kidneys.

Based on the PA catheter results, it demonstrated decreased
filling pressures, but a preserved cardiac index.  The
patient was gently hydrated.  After the half-normal saline
was given, there was increased urine output with an
improvement of his creatinine.  In addition, at this time,
the patient started complaining of tooth pain but had no
other complaints.  Based on examination, it appeared that the
patient had a tooth abscess and was started on clindamycin.
It was determined to consult Oral Surgery.

By [**2196-2-6**], the patient had decreased MAPs in the 40s and
was started on a dopamine drip with an improvement in his
blood pressure.  The goal is to titrate the dopamine off, as
the patient was gently hydrated.  He was continued on his
carvedilol.  The digoxin was held as was his ACE inhibitor
and diuretics.  The acute renal failure continued to improve
with hydration.  Based on oral surgery examination, the tooth
was extracted on [**2196-2-8**].

By 6:10 on [**2196-2-8**], dopamine was weaned off.  The
pacemaker was adjusted by Electrophysiology.  His Swan was
removed at 7:00 a.m. on [**2196-2-9**].  The patient
continued to remain stable, had improved p.o. intake
following the tooth extraction.  He was reinstituted on his
low-dose ACE inhibitor as well as digoxin.  His acute renal
failure by this point had corrected with IV fluids, since the
patient was prerenal due to the decreased p.o. intake with
his tooth abscess.  He was continued on Clindamycin.

The patient was transferred to the floor the following day
without complications, although at this time the patient was
noted to have increased LFTs.  Hepatology was consulted, in
light of his history of hepatitis B.  It was assumed that the
increase in LFTs was also due to the prolonged hypoperfusion.
Based on the Hepatology consult, the clindamycin was
discontinued and an abdominal ultrasound was ordered.

From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient remained stable
and his medications were being titrated to his home regimen.
On [**2196-2-12**], it was noted that the patient's pacer was
spiking on P waves and Electrophysiology was reconsulted.  He
was then changed from a DDI to DDD.  The patient was
discharged on [**2196-2-12**].

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was given instructions to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2196-2-25**] at 12:30 p.m. with a
laboratory check on [**2196-2-24**].  In addition, the patient
was discharged with follow-up to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the Liver
Center in [**Month (only) 116**] for the follow-up of his LFTs as well as all of
his hepatitis serologies that were sent during his stay.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Tooth abscess leading to decreased p.o. intake, and
hypovolemia.  The patient was prerenal leading to acute renal
failure and resultant hyperkalemia.
2.  Pacemaker irregularities that needed to be corrected by
Electrophysiology.
3.  History of decompensated congestive heart failure
secondary to myocardial infarction in [**2192**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improved, stable.
