CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: R lung opacity, ? aspiration

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man s/p aortic stent for transection, extubated,
clinically doing well, OOB to chair, no cough or focal lung
findings.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R lung opacity, ? aspiration
AP CHEST, 3:56 A.M., [**4-20**].

HISTORY: Aortic stent for transsection. Extubated. No cough or
focal lung findings.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-16**] through 27:

Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened slightly since
[**4-19**], and moderate cardiomegaly is more pronounced. There is
no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Widened
mediastinum around the stented aorta is stable. Transvenous
right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead pointing cephalad and
the transvenous right atrial lead following a more standard
course are both unchanged. Nasogastric tube passes to the mid
stomach.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE

Reason: stenosis?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man s/p right parietal ischemic stroke
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
stenosis?
CAROTID DUPLEX

REASON: 54-year-old male with right parietal ischemic stroke.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed on both carotid
arteries.

On the right the peak systolic velocities are 73/26 in the ICA,
69/21 in the CCA and 86 in the ECA. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.06
and this is consistent with widely patent right internal carotid
artery.

On the left the peak systolic velocities are 63/29 in the ICA,
73/22 in the CCA and 68 in the ECA. The ICA/CCA ratio is 0.86
and this is consistent with a widely patent left internal
carotid artery.

There is antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery. However
there is retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery. There is
a monophasic left brachial artery and this is indicative of left
subclavian steal syndrome.

IMPRESSION: There is a widely patent right internal carotid
artery and a widely patent left internal carotid artery with
antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery but retrograde flow
in the left vertebral artery which appears to be indicative of
the left subclavian steal secondary to monophasic flow in the
left brachial artery.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS

Reason: r/o arterial occlusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with aortic transection s/p placemnt of
endovascular stent
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o arterial occlusion
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 54-year-old man with aortic transection, status post
endovascular stent. Assess for arterial occlusion.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: CTA of the head and neck.

FINDINGS: There is a wedge-shaped hypodensity in the right
parietal region involving the white and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, spanning
roughly 3 cm. There is patency of the major vessels in the
anterior and posterior circulation without evidence of aneurysm.
No other areas of abnormal density are noted in the brain
parenchyma. There is no hydrocephalus. There is no shift of
normally midline structures. There is mild local sulcal
effacement.

There are several air-fluid levels in multiple paranasal
sinuses, and the patient is intubated.

A thoracic aortic graft is incompletely visualized, extending
from the aortic arch to the descending aorta. There is edema in
the surrounding mediastinal tissues. A nasogastric tube as well
as an endotracheal tube are noted. There are bilateral small
pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, and other
opacities in the lung apices which are not fully visualized on
this study.

The soft tissues demonstrate swelling along the right and left
occipital regions.

IMPRESSION: Right parietal infarct, in a watershed distribution,
which is consistent with hypoperfusion. No evidence of arterial
occlusion.

ECHO report:

Conclusions:
1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apex and the inferior wall. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed.

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. No obvious intimal flap/aortic dissection seen in the
descending aorta. The
descending aortic wall is thickened consistent with an
intramural hematoma.

5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

7. LIMITED EXAMINATION given emergent nature of the procedure.

8.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken directly to the OR for repair of ruptured
descending thoracic aorta with stent grafting, diagnostic
thoracic aortogram, repair of left femoral artery, exploratory
laparotomy, splenectomy, and cautery to control liver
laceration.  He was transferred to the Cardiac ICU for
monitoring.  He remained hemodynamically stable overnight and
was then transferred to the Trauma ICU.

On HD 3, a head CT to evaluate the major vessels revealed a
right parietal infarct, in a watershed distribution, which is
consistent with hypoperfusion.  Neurology was consulted and
recommended maintaining adequate blood pressure control,
following labs and neuro exam closely. His mental status
improved throughout his hospital course and he will require
follow up in the Stroke/[**Hospital 878**] Clinic as an outpatient. He is
being discharged on Aspirin.

He was extubated on HD #5 and was eventually transferred to the
floor. Speech Language Pathology consult was also obtained given
the right parietal stroke; it was recommended that further
cognitive testing to evaluate for areas of impairment. and
Speech-language therapy after discharge as an outpatient to
ensure that he will be able to return to work when able.

Physical and Occupational therapy were also consulted early
during his hospital course; it was initially thought that he
would require inpatient rehab stay after discharge. He
progressed rather quickly with his therapy and is being
discharged to home with services.

He will follow up with Trauma Surgery, Neurology and Vascular
Surgery in their respective clinics after discharge.
