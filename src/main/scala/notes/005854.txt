Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with history of DM, COPD, PVD, rectal abscess, and
recent d/c for hemorrhagic stroke (?), presented with altered
MS, hypoglycemia, fever, and hypotension.  The sepsis source was
not determined; his perirectal abscess and history of C.diff was
suspected.  The sepsis resolved with IVF via central line and
antibiotics (vanc/levo/flagyl 14 day course).  The patient was
on pressors for one day.  He presented in acute renal failure,
but this subsided with IVF (Cr of 1.1 on discharge).  He
received one unit of pRBCs and his Hct remained stable.  A head
CT was negative.  An abdominal CT was done to rule out toxic
megacolon, but it did show large bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Upon transfer to the floor on [**7-23**], he was hypertensive and
afebrile.  The patient had an episode of respiratory distress on
[**7-23**], thought to be due to volume overload from fluid boluses in
the ICU and pleural effusions.  Repeat ABGs were done and this
resolved with BiPAP 10/5 and IV lasix.  He remained slightly
tachypneic 22-26 on discharge, but was not using accessory
muscles of respiration and denied shortness of breath.  It was
decided to postpone thoracentesis unless patient became febrile
or in respiratory distress again.  The patient is being
discharged on lasix for 11 days for medical management of the
effusions.  He should have repeat chemistries to monitor his BUN
and Cr.
.
Surgery was consulted to evaluate the patient's perirectal
abscess.  A rectal tube was used to avoid contamination of the
wound.  Wound care was consulted and recommended wet to dry
dressing changes [**Hospital1 **].  His diarrhea had decreased while on the
floor, and his rectal tube was removed on discharge.  The
patient was also negative for C.Diff times three so contact
precautions were removed.
.
The patient had a recent history of CVA.  He ruled out for a new
stroke and there was no indication for LP.  He has some
delusional/paranoid behavior at night and was given 0.5 mg
haldol prn agitation.  His mental status is now likely at
baseline.  The patient was continued on asa and aggrenox.
.
The patient had new onset of atrial fibrillation this admission.
 Anticoagulation was discussed with his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] now we will
rely on aggrenox and asa for prophylaxis; the patient has a
significant risks (falls- poor eyesight, age, ?of hemorrhagic
stroke) for starting anticoagulation.  This will be followed up
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  His blood pressure and rate was controlled
with metoprolol, isosorbide, and captopril
.
The patient's blood sugars were controlled on a 12 unit fixed
dose of regular insulin and sliding scale.
.
The patient was a full code.
