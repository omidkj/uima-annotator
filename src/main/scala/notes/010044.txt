Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Reason for Transfer: severe post-ERCP pancreatitis.
.
The patient is a 25 yo F with post-ERCP pancreatitis transferred
from an OSH for further management.  Pt describes sharp,
stabbing, RUQ pain beginning ~[**1-10**] a/w N/V/fever.  Pt underwent
a lap chole in [**3-14**] for her 2 months of abdominal pain
associated with nausea and vomiting. The pain persisted after
the lap chole and her LFTs increased. One week PTA, the patient
saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48587**] for a GI consult, and underwent an outpatient
ERCP on [**2140-8-2**] which showed an 8mm dilated CBD and CBD stone. A
sphincterotomy was performed and the stone was removed. Later
that day, the pt complained of severe abdominal pain and
presented to the [**Hospital1 189**] Emergency Room. Amylase returned at
3,818 and lipase at 12,148. She was given pain meds and fluids
at 200cc/hr, however, pt continued to complain of pain and she
began to third space all fluids. (hemoconcentration Hct 41->
48%, intravascular depletion with Cr up to 1.4, borderline urine
output at 30 cc/h, somewhat tachycardic, low grade-temps to
100).  CT abdomen confirmed 3rd spacing, but showed pancreas
still perfused. A PICC was placed for TPN and pt was on a
dilaudid PCA. The patient was transferred to MICU for further
management.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was complaining of severe pain and her
HR was in the 140s. Over the next two days, she received a total
of 12L and her pain was controlled with 1mg of dilaudid every
3hrs. She was alert and requesting liquids. She was transferred
to the floor on HD#3. On the floor, pt was somnolent but
arousable with HR into the 110s (up to 140s with pain), RR in
the 20s but up to 30s with pain. O2 sats remained stable >92%
with 2L. On night prior to txf back to MICU, pt triggered with
acute SOB and HR up to 140s, 92% on 2L. She was given dilaudid,
nebs and ativan and she improved both symptomatically and
clinically. During her stay on the floor, her fluids were
decreased from 200 cc/hr to 75 cc/hr due to increasing concern
for third spacing and worsening pleural effusions. On day of
transfer, pt's HR again increased to 140 with worsening abd
pain, located in RUQ associated with more SOB. Again, the team
tried nebs, ativan and dilaudid, this time with no improvement.
Bld gas showed 7.4/33/55 on 2L with a lactate of 2.5. Temp
spiked to 101.7 and bld cx were drawn. A CXR showed a large
gastric bubble, low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions
(but unchaged from prior CXR). The ICU was called to evaluate
pt.
.
On txf back to the ICU, pt was somnolent, answering questions
with one-word answers. She was very tachypneic with a RR in the
40s and diaphoretic. She complained of not being able to pull
enough air in. She pointed to her RUQ when asked where she had
pain. She denied nausea, vomiting or constipation. Last bowel
movement yesterday. On ambulation to the bathroom, HR increased
to 178.

[**2140-8-2**] OSH ERCP - 8mm gallstone in the distal common bile duct,
status post successful sphincterotomy and balloon extraction.
.
[**2140-8-3**] OSH CT Abdomen - prominent head of the pancreas with
free fluid in the right anterior perirenal space and free fluid
within the pelvis consistent with pancreatitis
.
[**2140-8-5**] OSH CT Abdomen - Dramatic interval increase in the amout
of free fluid within the abdomen.  New small bilateral pleural
effusions and compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes
bilaterally.  The pancreas is relatively unremarkable in
appearance.

[**2140-8-10**] CT Abd/pelvis - Complex collection in the anterior
mediastinum measuring 4.7 x 4.0 cm which most likely represents
a moderate-sized hematoma.  There is no evidence of compression
on the adjacent trachea or vascular structures.  Clinical
correlation recommended. Bibasilar consolidation with air
bronchograms which may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Large right and smaller left pleural effusions and small
pericardial effusion. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
Normal appearance of the pancreas without evidence of
pancreatitis or
pseudocyst. Diffuse anasarca and mild ascites.

[**2140-8-11**] TTE - The LA is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale. Mild symmetric LV hypertrophy. The LV
cavity is  unusually small. LV systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF 80%).  RV size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function  is normal.  Trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No
tamponade.

[**2140-8-14**] CT abd/pelvis - Stable appearing complex collection
within the anterior mediastinum which could represent a
hematoma.  An alternate consideration is lymphadenopathy (query
history of lymphoma), or thymoma.  Clinical correlation is
recommended. No evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic
pseudocyst, or calcifications. Slight increase in mesenteric and
intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites.  Diffuse anasarca.
Slight decrease in the right pleural effusion.  Right basilar
atelectasis
versus pneumonia. Small pericardial effusion. Fatty infiltration
of the liver.

[**2140-8-24**] TEE - No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left  atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect. LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). RV chamber si
