History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] is a 35 year-old man with DMI (c/b retinopathy,
DKA, gastroparesis), ESRD on HD (MWF), HTN presenting with
vomiting. He presents with his usual onset of gastric burning
pain earlier today. Also with nausea and vomiting. He also
described that he also had small a amount of bright red blood in
his vomitus. Denies any bright red blood per rectum or melena.

  In the ED, initial vs were 97.3 105 211/125 18 98% RA. Patient
was tachycardic, with no focal findings including benign
abdomen. Labs were notable for K 5.3, Cr 8.9, BUN 56, glucose
288 and an anion gap of 16. Pt was given 4L NS, 4 units i.v.
insulin was started on an insulin drip, Zofran and morphine.
Guiaic was negative and NG lavage identified blood clots and
coffegrounds that cleard with 100 cc fluid. GI was consulted in
the ED and advised IV PPI, NPO and possible EGD in AM to
evaluate possible [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from retching. The patient
was then admitted to the MICU for further care. On transfer, VS
were 86 158/80 18 98%RA.

bed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 35 year old man with type I diabetes mellitus,
gastroparesis, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and
hypertension admitted with nausea, vomiting and hematemesis who
was initially admitted to the MICU for close monitoring of
hematmesis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#. Hematemesis: His small volume hematemesis was likely caused
by retching in the setting of gastroparesis. His NG lavage
cleared with 100mL. The hematocrit drop observed between his
presentation hct of 32.8 and admission hct of 25.9 was likely
hemodilution secondary to 4L NS given in the ED. He was started
on a pantoprazole drip, antiemetics. Endoscopy showed no
evidence of bleeding, so small mucosal tear suspected as
etiology.  Hematocrit remained stable, and he had no further
episodes of hematemesis.  He was discharged on omeprazole.

#. Nausea/vomiting/gastroparesis: Patient has had multiple
admissions for nausea and vomiting secondary to gastroparesis
most recently discharge on [**11-23**]. It is likely that this
presentation is due to a flare of his gastroparesis. He had no
signs or symptoms of an infectious etiology. Compazine and
zofran were given for antiemetic therapy. Erythromycin and
reglan were continued for motility. He was discharged with an rx
for compazine.

#Type I diabetes mellitus: The patient presented in a
hyperglycemic state with a trend towards DKA given glucose of
288, HCO3 of 20 and AG of 16. He was started on an insulin gtt
in the ED. This was stopped in the MICU and he was restarted on
his home insulin regimen.  His sugars from then on were
reasonably controlled.  No changes were made to his insulin
regimen on discharge.

#Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive the ED to 210s/120s
likely secondary to distress from nausea and vomiting that
improved rapidly with antiemetic and analgesic therapy. He was
conitnued on his home lisinopril.

#End stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Patient underwent HD
on [**12-5**]. He was continued on Sevelamer, NephroCaps and Epo at
HD.
