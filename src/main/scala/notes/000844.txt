Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vasotec / Niacin

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86 y.o. male with pmh significant for CAD s/p
PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX in [**2163**], chronically occluded RCA with
L->R collaterals, dilated cardiomyopathy of [**11-5**]% presenting to
his outpatient Cardiologist with several weeks of lethargy, and
found to be bradycardic with HR in the 30's. EKG in office
showed Junctional bradycardia at a rate of 30, blood pressure
60/palp. He was given atropine 2mg with increased Hr to 40's,
and then transferred to the ED. In the ED his HR remained in the
30-40's with blood pressure of 110/50. He developed an increased
oxygen requirement with O2 saturation 60-70% on NRB. Head CT was
performed to rule out CVA as cause of bradycardia and was found
to be negative for acute bleed. Patient was also found to be in
acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.5 from baseline 2.5.
His potassium was also initially found to elevated at 9.0 in a
hemolyzed sample. Repeat K was 5.0. Diqoxin level was found to
be 0.7. Repeat K was 5.0. Given his progressive hypoxia he was
intubated with O2 saturation of 100% on FiO2 100%. In the ED his
rhythm alternated between sinus and junctional bradycardia.
His vitals were HR 37-39, blood pressure (77-116)/(33-46). He
was given aspirin, atropine, sodium bicarbonate, insulin 10
units, an amp of D50, albuterol nebs.
Per medical records, the patient has been hospitalized several
times in the past for both acute on chronic congestive heart
failure and acute renal failure attributed to poor forward flow
from CHF. he was most revcently admitted from [**2166-12-18**] through
[**2166-12-25**], during which he was diuresed 10L in the CCU on a lasix
drip with BP support from milrinone and phenylephrine. Upon
discharge, bumex was added and torsemide was discontinued. On
[**1-13**] the patient had increased creatinine detected on routine
labs, which resulted in a decrease of his bumex from 4mg to 3mg
PO BID. He then experienced a 5lb increased weight gain and had
his bumex increased to 4mg PO BID on [**2167-1-23**].
.
Per wife, patient has had increased confusion over past three
days, in addition to abdominal pain and diahrrea.

Brief Hospital Course:
**The patient expired on [**2167-1-30**].**

An 86 man with a history of CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy with
LVEF 15%, presented with junctional bradycardia, hypoxia,
hypothermia, hypotension.
.
#Hypotension: MAP on admission was 55. Recent vitals from
outpatient records show baseline BP 95/40. Hypotension was
likely secondary to systolic congestive heart failure.  BNP
elevated at >24 000 was consistent with this.  Sepsis was also
on the differential, and vancomycin and zosyn were initially
started. No arterial line or central line was placed because of
elevated INR 7.9 on admission.  Peripheral dopamine and fluid
boluses were initially given to maintain MAP >60.  He became
hypertensive with frequent ectopy.  Dopamine was weaned off and
levophed briefly added as a bridge to milrinone which was also
started.  After conversation with his wife, the decision was
made to pursue comfort measures only.  All pressors were
stopped. The patient became progressively more hypotensive and
expired.
.
#Bradycardia: On admission he was fluctuating between sinus and
junctional bradycardia.  Contributions likely included hypoxia,
hypothermia, and acute renal failure. Cardiac ischemia was on
the differential as well, but EKG without ischemic changes and
elevated troponin likely [**2-23**] renal failure.  Pressors were
initiaed as above.  Peripheral dopamine was initially started to
maintain MAP >60.  This was changed to milrinone as above.
.
#Respiratory Status:  He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure in ED, was 70% on NRB. CXR with pulmonary infiltrates
suggestive of CHF. He was not diuresed because of hypotension.
He oxygenated well on the ventilator with 100% FiO2.  After
comfort measures were initiated, the decision was made in
conversation with his wife to extubate.  Shortly after
extubation he expired.
.
#Acute renal failure: Creatinine was 5.5, up from baseline of
2.5. This was likely secondary to exacerbation of congestive
heart failure with low cardiac output with a possible component
of overdiuresis.  [**Month/Day (2) **] lytes showed a pre-renal state.  Renal
was consulted and saw no need for CVVH or HD.
.
#Hypothermia: A bear hugger was placed.  Infection was suspected
as a cause.  His wife was reporting three days of confusion,
abdominal pain and diahrrea. Sputum grew staph aureas.  Blood
and [**Month/Day (2) **] cultures as well as stool for c diff were negative.
He was initially treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin.
These were stopped when comfort measures only was initiated.
.
# Coronaries: History of CAD s/p PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX in
[**2163**], and chronically occluded RCA with L->R collaterals. EKG
was without ischemic changes, troponin was elevated, likely
secondary to renal failure, but CK was normal and there was low
suspicion for acute ischemia.
.
#Bullous Pemphigoid: Minocycline and hydroxyzine were in setting
of acute illness.  Sarna cream was continued.
