Increased oxygen requirement, volume overload

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 87 yo man w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-D1,SVG-LAD,
SVG-Ramus;SVG--OM;SVG--PDA), Afib ( on warfarin), diet
controlled DM, CHF (EF 35%) who presents with 1 week of volume
overload from his nursing home. Pt has baseline CHF who is on 3L
O2 at baseline, on 40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] at baseline. Over past
week, has noted increased volume overload, increased O2
requirement to 5L NC. He has been more edematous. He denies any
recent fevers, chills, chest pains, cough, or sputum production.
The only change in his medication has been increasing doses of
lasix. Today, attempted diuresis with lasix 40mg PO x 1,
followed by 80mg IV x1, followed by 100mg IV x 1, followed by
metolazone. UOP on these interventions only 200cc, so patient
sent to ED.
.
On presentation to [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile, RR 18, O2 sat 100% on
NRB. Exam notable for mild resp distress, elevated JVP, crackles
on exam. Lactate noted to be 2.5. ABG: 7.44/35/112. EKG: V
paced, unchanged. CXR shows fluid overload. He was treated with
metolazone 5mg PO then lasix 200mg IV with 200cc UOP. Patient
admitted to CCU for further management.
.
Currently, he feels quite well. He reports decreased SOB and has
been weaned to 5L NC. He is alert and interactive. He denies any
chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath at rest. At
night, he uses 1 pillow to sleep.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo man w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, Afib s/p BiV pacer, DM, CHF (EF
35%) who presented with 1 week volume overload, increased O2
requirement. Hospital course by problem:
.
#) Cardiac Pump/Goals of care: Pt w/ h/o CHF, EF 35% on last
ECHO in [**3-1**], also moderate MR and mod-severe TR, RV moderately
dilated, presented w/ apparent CHF exacerbation with increased
volume overload, increased O2 requirement, no response to
increased lasix at NH.  We treated him in the CCU with
aggressive diuresis.  He required a lasix gtt (up to 20/h) and
metolazone.  He diuresed >12L but still had persistent O2
requirement and inability to ambulate without significant
dyspnea.  We also added spironolactone temporarily.  Given his
end stage CHF and poor functional capacity, we discussed his
prognosis with the patient and family.  The patient very much
wanted to go home.  He had an understanding of the severity of
his disease.  He requested to go home with hospice care to focus
on comfort.  Per his request, we left the foley in place.  He
was discharged on lasix 40-60 mg daily to be titrated to a goal
of 1-2L negative per day of diuresis.  If fluid overload
worsens, he will likely develop worsening O2 requirement.  Given
the goals of hospice and comfort, we have prescribed ativan and
morphine to be administered if patient is exhibiting signs of
respiratory distress.
.
# Respiratory: as above.  Patient also has an underlying
interstitial lung disease (PFTs with restrictive pattern) which
likely worsened his symptoms.  We treated with albuterol and
atrovent nebs which made some change in his resp status.  He is
discharged on these medications.
.
# CAD: continued carvedilol.  no ASA given allergy.  CE neg.  no
chest pain
.
# Rhythm: hx of AFib w/ slow ventricular response, s/p
pacer/AICD placement.  He was VPaced.  After the family meeting,
we had the ICD turned off to congruence with the goals of care.
We also stopped the amio, digoxin, and coumadin.
.
# ID: Patient had C diff and came in on flagyl.  we completed
>14 day course and d/c'd this medication prior to discharge.
.
# Chronic renal failure.  Baseline creatinine 1.4.  He was
slightly worsened with diuresis.
.
# Iron Deficiency Anemia: profound iron deficiency.  Hct stable.
 Discharged on iron.  We felt that administration of blood would
likely precipitate pulmonary edema.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI.  Comfort measures, per d/w patient and HCP
.
# Contact: [**Name (NI) **] is HCP named [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94177**].
.
# Dispo status: Patient largely bedridden.  Can pivot with
assistance but with significant exertion.  He has bibasilar
crackles and remains on 6L O2.  His mood is generally well and
he is looking forward to going home.
