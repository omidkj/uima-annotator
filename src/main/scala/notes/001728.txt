Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6180**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased abdominal girth, lower extremity edema and shortness
of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 65 year-old female with metastatic hepatoma who
initially presented to clinic complaining of increased abdominal
girth, lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.

She has been non-compliant with diuretic therapy and only
recently restarted Lasix 20 mg daily.  Over the last month PTA,
the pt. has noticed significant increase in her abdominal girth
as well as her pedal edema. Her appetite has been poor over this
time period.  She also noted increasing shortness of breath and
an inability to ambulate more than a few feet secondary to lower
extremity edema and shortness of breath. She was seen in clinic
one week PTA at which time the dosages of diuretics were
increased; she refused a paracentesis.  Despite the increased
dose of lasix and aldactone, the pt. has experienced volume
overload.  She was admitted for further diuresis and a
therapeutic paracentesis.

On review of systems, the pt. denied recent fever, chills,
cough, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria,
arthralgias or myalgias.  She has noticed recent loss of
appetite, shortness of breath, and chronic right chest wall
pain.

Oncologic Hx: The pt. contracted hepatitis C due to a blood
transfusion approximately 15 years ago in [**Country 11150**]. She underwent
radiofrequency ablation of hepatomas in 8/[**2140**].  She was
initially treated with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and gemcitabine
from [**6-13**] to [**12-14**] but failed treatment on this protocol as
evidenced by rising AFP and worsening physical exam findings.
She underwent radiation to painful rib lesions in [**12-14**]. She was
then treated with Xeloda in [**1-13**].  She has been most recently
treated with weekly 5-FU and leucovorin in [**4-14**]. Her last dose
was on [**2142-4-26**] and it has been held since then due to
thrombocytopenia and fatigue.
*
She was transferred to the MICU for the development of
hypotension to 60/40 -BP on admission = 122/80, and increasing
O2 requirment on with gas = O2= 86 CO2 = 35 pH = 7.36 on 12 L
NRB. The patient underwent a diagnostic tap and then received
dopamine to maintain her BPs.

Past Medical History:
-hepatitis C due to a blood transfusion approximately 10 years
ago and hepatocellular carcinoma
-hypertension
-hypothyroidism

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN

Reason: uncomfortable ascites

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with HCC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
uncomfortable ascites
CLINICAL HISTORY: 65-year-old female with hepatocellular
carcinoma and uncomfortable ascites.

LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: Targeted ultrasound of all 4
quadrants of the abdomen was performed to evaluate ascites.
There is a large volume of ascites visible throughout the
abdomen. The liver was not assessed on this study.

IMPRESSION: Large volume of ascites.

DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL PORT

Reason: RUQ with dopplerspatent portal system?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with metastatic hepatoma who presents with
worsening ascites and hypotension
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
RUQ with dopplerspatent portal system?
PORTABLE DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER.

INDICATION: Metastatic hepatoma, worsening ascites and
hypotension.

FINDINGS: Limited portable Doppler ultrasound of the liver was
performed at the bedside.

Liver is nodular and shrunken, consistent with cirrhosis, with
moderate ascites.

Main portal vein is patent. Posterior branch of the right portal
vein is patent; however, the anterior branch of the right portal
vein is not visualized. Left portal vein is thrombosed. The
hepatic veins are grossly patent. Left and right hepatic artery
branches are likewise patent.

IMPRESSION: Patent main portal and posterior branch of the right
portal vein. Anterior right portal vein is not visualized, and
the left portal vein is thrombosed, possibly with tumor
thrombus.

Overall, the imaging findings are similar when compared with CT
scan dated [**2142-4-14**].
