his black left toes of two days duration.Patient began on
Vancomycin,levofloxcin and flagyl, this was continued after
admission.Patient's admitting inr 9.0 requiring reversal with
vitamin K and FFp.Matient was alsonoted to be metabolic acidosis
which was corrected with bicarbonate drip.Renal was consulted
for managment of his chronic renal failure.
Podiatry was also consulted. recommendations were to continue
current antibiotic thearphy, obtain PVR's and nonwieght bearing
ambulation.
[**2191-8-26**] Renagel started for hyperphosphtemia. Calcitrol started
for elevated PTH of 398 Iv bicarbonate drip continued.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 11227**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o male who presented with a necrotic toe,
acute on chronic renal failure, and a grossly elevated INR.  The
following issues were addressed:

1.ID: Due to his necrotic toe and grossly positive wound
culture, he was initially started on renally dosed vanco, levo,
flagyl. He reamined afebrile and without an elevated WBC ct. We
drew and monitored blood and urine cultures.  This was evaluated
by vascular surgery and podiatry and felt to be dry gangrene.
As this is not a worry for bloodstream seeding/sepsis, and his
cultures remained negative, the antibiotics were stopped.  His
WBC ct stayed stable and he had no fevers afterwards.

2.Vascular:His necrotic toe needed to be amputated.  Vascular
surgery team also wanted to perform arterial bypass to
revascularize region.  This would save him from further
amputation in the nea future. Unable to get MRA of his arteries
due to his pacemaker.  We were initially concerned with getting
an angiogram due to his poor renal function and the fear that a
dye load would cause him to go into permanent renal failure
requiring dialysis.  This was discussed with the patient, his
wife, and his son(HCP) and they wanted to go forward with the
angio.  This was done, as was vein mapping, and the patient was
taken to surgery.

3.Renal: Renal was consulted.  They recommended fluids to
provide as well as management options if he were to undergo
angiogram.  His creatinine initially improved with fluids, but
then seemed to level out around 5.  This is higher than his
previous baseline.  He was not initially dialyzed, although he
was probably mildly uremic and spent some of his days very
sleepy in a chair or bed.  Before the angiogram, he was treated
with Mucomist and alkalinized fluids to prophylax against renal
damage.
This also helped the metabolic acidosis he developed as a result
of his renal failure.  Lactate nL, so acidosis not thought to be
a result of his necrotic toe.  After the angiogram/surgery, his
creatinine stayed level at approx 5 for several days.___________

3. INR: His initial INR was 9 and that quickly rose to 18 over
the course of 10 hours or so. We had good reason why, but could
be related to decreased PO intake and new antibiotics?. He got 2
Units FFP, 1 mg IV vit K, 10 mg SQ vitamin K. This brought it
down to 4.8, and then to 1.5. We held his coumadin, but started
a heparin drip to continue to preotect him against thrombosis.
His Hct stayed stable, so did not likely bleed as a result of
his high INR.

4. Pulm/CHF: He was breathing well and satting normally
thoroughout.  We were giving him fluids due to his ARF, but had
to be careful as he had a known compensated heart failure.
Serial lung exams were perfoemed while he was being hydrated
that remained clear.  After initial hydration, his fluid rate
was slowed down to approx 50 cc/h, and he had no trouble with
this.

5.Pain:His feet were causing him a lot of pain, mostly a cold
sensation.  This was managed with Tylenol, oxycodone sparingly,
and many warm blankets/wraps.  After surgery,
