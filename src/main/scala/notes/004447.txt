Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year-old
male, with a history of stage 2-B melanoma, excised from his
left upper arm in [**2189**].  He developed local recurrence.
Subsequent biopsy with excision and resection.  He underwent
14 cycles of chemotherapy and follow-up CT scans demonstrated
two small pulmonary nodules on the left.  Repeat CT scan was
consistent with some enlargement of the pulmonary nodules.
The patient presented at the time of admission for an
elective wedge resection of pulmonary nodules by means of a
video assisted thoracoscopy and bronchoscopy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Furosemide, Lisinopril, Digoxin,
Plavix, Atenolol and Lipitor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes metastatic melanoma, status
post multiple excisions and sentinel node biopsy; also
history of coronary artery disease, status post stenting.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the thoracic
surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  On hospital
day number one, he underwent a wedge resection of metastatic
melanoma on the left upper and left lower lobes, along with
bronchoscopy.  He tolerated the procedure well with minimal
blood loss and was transferred to the floor after surgery.
His pain was well controlled with patient controlled
anesthesia.  On postoperative day number two, his chest tube
was placed on water seal and a chest x-ray was stable.  It
was decided that this chest tube would be removed.  A chest x-
ray following removal of the chest tube revealed a
pneumothorax on the left, of about 20% of the lung.  The
patient was satting well following this complication but it
was decided that the chest tube should be replaced with a 20
French chest tube.  This was accomplished.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  Chest tube was placed on
suction.  The patient was placed on telemetry and oxygen as
needed.

Chest x-ray on postoperative day number three showed
resolving pneumothorax. The chest tube was placed back to
water seal.  A repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day number
four continued to be stable.  It was decided that the chest
tube would be removed, as the last chest x-ray was stable and
the patient was discharged home.

The patient was instructed to call the Emergency Room or
surgery clinic if he observed any increasing pain, swelling,
drainage, bleeding, shortness of breath, chest pain or
elevated temperature.  He was instructed to avoid driving
while taking narcotic pain medications and was told to leave
the dressing over the chest tube site for 2 to 3 days and
then to remove and use bandages as needed.  He was told to
avoid soaking his wound.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Stage 2-B melanoma, metastatic.
2. Pulmonary nodules.
3. Status post bronchoscopy and left VAC.


FOLLOW UP:  Instructions included follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in one to two weeks.
Call the thoracic surgery clinic for an appointment.

At the time of discharge, the patient was stable, tolerating
a regular diet and ambulating independently.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day.
2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient was instructed to
   start this after the chest tube was removed at the time of
   discharge.
