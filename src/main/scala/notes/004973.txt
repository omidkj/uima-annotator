Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
ICU to ICU transfer for CVA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
extubation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 47F yo ? HW with poorly controlled DM HTN, obesity
and cardiomyopathy (EF 20% on recent hospitalization at [**Hospital **]
Hospital, ? ishcemic), who initially presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital with c/o of headache and
was found to have word-finding difficulty on [**3-13**].  At time of
evaluation, she was noted to have a hypodensity oh head CT
concerning for a
subacute right occipital stroke.  Given this she was admitted
for
further stroke w/up, although it was understood that symptoms
did
not match the findings.

She subsequently developed RUE weakness and a repeat HCT showed
a
large, left hemisphere hypodensity concerning for an MCA
infarct.
She was started on heparin gtt at this time.  MRI/A of the head
and neck was performed and revealed an acute L Temporoparietal
infarct, subacute right occipital infarct and an occlusion of L
ICA.  After the MRI and neurology consultation, heparing gtt was
stopped given the size of the infarct in evolution.  Because of
difficulties controlling BPs and evidence of dysrhythmia (? SVT,
wide complex tachycardia) she was transferred to ICU.  On [**3-14**]
late evening patient was apparently restarted on heparin gtt for
hours on heparin gtt (duration unclear), pt decompensated:
became
aphasic with right sided hemiparesis.  She was thus intubated
for
"airway protection"

Since intubation she has been "stable...she has remained sedated
and intubated, responds to verbal stimuli and moves her Left
side, with right side flaccid."   TPN has been started [**3-16**] for
nutritional support.

Initial exam on [**3-12**] was notable for normal mental status
including
language, R hemianopsia, VII mild paresis and right spastic
hemiparesis. Pt. was unable to stand on her own, needed an
assisting device.  PP decreased over R side of body.  She was
started on Aggrenox per Neurology recommendation and was
recommended to have CTA to look for "residual lumen."

Work up so far included Telemetry (wide complext tachycardia),
TTE on [**3-14**] revealed EF 20-25% (severe global hypokinesis) with
dyskinetic septum, decreaed RVF and pressures in 30-40mmHg
range,
no source of embolus, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] TR w/ biatrial
enlargement.  TEE was recommended and showed LVEF as above, but
no source of embolus.    There was ? of sarcoidosis given
adenopathy.

EEG on [**3-14**] showed background slowing and lateralization of
slowing to LEFT hemisphere w/ focality and sharp wave
development, no seizure discharge.

Of note, she has been found to have a positive Lyme titer, thus
was treated with IV ABx (MD reporting was unsure of IgG vs
IgM?).
Also of Note, her blood pressures were fluctuating including max
of SBP of 190.

Imaging:

CXR:  FINDINGS: The patient has been intubated. The tip of the
tube projects 3 to
4 cm above the carina. The tip of the newly inserted right PICC
line projects
over the low SVC. The course of the line is unremarkable. There
is no
evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The course
of the
nasogastric tube is also unremarkable, the tip of the tube is
not visualized
on this film.

There is marked cardiomegaly with perihilar blunting and
dependent opacities.
In combination with a slightly distended azygos vein, the image
suggests
[**Month/Day/Year 1192**] pulmonary edema.

The presence of a small left-sided pleural effusion cannot be
excluded; on the
right, no pleural effusion is seen.

No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

OSH imaging:

MRI OSH [**3-12**]:

Large wedge shape of restricted DWI in Left pareital lobe.  DWI
of bright signal intensity in Right occipital lobe w/ ehnacement
after contrast administration.   Few small foci on Flair in b/l
hemispheres.
