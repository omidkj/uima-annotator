CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain at rest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old male with
significant history of coronary artery disease, status post
anterior myocardial infarction in [**2133**] with residual ejection
fraction 20%, status post left anterior descending stent at
that time, status post ICD in [**2134**] for VT/syncope, status
post PCI/stents to the left circumflex in [**2137**], status post
catheterization in [**2138-7-12**] for chest pain which showed
patent vessels and stent.  He was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**].

Approximately one week ago, patient started an exercise
program with walking.  He experienced chest pressure after
walking one fourth of a mile.  Pressure was relieved with
rest.  Today, patient had [**10-21**] chest pressure at rest, mildly
relieved with nitroglycerin.  Patient went to the Emergency
Department at an outside hospital.  He was given
nitroglycerin sublingually and morphine.  In approximately
five hours, the patient was pain free.  Patient's discomfort
was associated with nausea.  He denies diaphoresis.  Of note,
patient has intermittent shortness of breath at baseline.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for further work-up.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As noted above.
1.  Extensive coronary artery disease.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction 20%.
3.  ICD in [**2134**] for VT/syncope.
4.  DDT after trauma in [**2110**].
5.  Patient has been on anticoagulation since [**2134**].
6.  Dyslipidema.
7.  Pulmonary hypertension.
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9.  Gastroparesis.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had a stroke in her 50s, negative for
early coronary artery disease, negative for
hypercoagulability.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married.  He is retired.  He
smoked for five years in the past.  He quit tobacco and
alcohol approximately 20 years ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 95.9.  Blood
pressure 112/76.  Heart rate 66.  Respiratory rate 20.
Oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.  Heart:  Regular rate
and rhythm, distant heart sounds, 1/6 systolic murmur.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild bilateral
basilar crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Good distal
pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit
39.9, platelet count of 238.  Chemistries showed a BUN and
creatinine of 17 and 1.2.  CK on admission was 158, MB 1.08,
MB index 0.7.  Troponin less than 0.2.  Electrocardiogram:
Normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, interventricular
conduction delay, normal QRS interval, right axis deviation,
biphasic T in lead III, poor R wave progression.  Chest
x-ray:  Mild congestive heart failure.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 48-year-old male with known coronary
artery disease, status post multiple interventions admitted
with chest pain at rest.  Patient initially admitted to [**Hospital6 21665**] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the [**Hospital6 13568**], patient was
administered heparin and nitroglycerin.  His Coumadin was
held in anticipation of catheterization.  Patient was
administered beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, aspirin and
spironolactone.  On [**5-8**], patient went for cardiac
catheterization.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.  The
left main coronary artery had 20-30% stenosis.  The left
anterior descending artery had mild diffuse disease only.
The left circumflex artery had 60% Instent restenosis within
the previously placed stent.  There was an incremental
stenosis to 70% just distal to the stent and before a
trifurcation of the vessel.  The right coronary artery had
mild diffuse disease.

The planned left heart catheterization revealed severely
elevated left heart filling pressures with a mean left
ventricular diastolic pressure of 36 mmHg.  Accordingly,
right heart catheterization was performed.  It was notable
for severe pulmonary hypertension.  Left ventriculography was
not performed.

Based on elevated fillings pressures noted at cardiac
catheterization, patient was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for PA catheter placement and guided therapy.  PA
catheter was placed and initial values were noted to be CDP
of 10, RV 45/10, PA 45/20 and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 20.  Patient was placed on >.........< drip
overnight.  Subsequent PA catheter readings showed diminished
cardiac output while patient was on >.......<.  >....<was
discontinued and patient's ACE inhibitor was increased as
tolerated.

Due to concern for patient's pulmonary hypertension,
echocardiogram with Bubble study was ordered as well as a VQ
scan.  Echocardiogram disclosed a markedly dilated left
atrium and right atrium.  There was no atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale.  The left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated.  There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, regional wall motion abnormalities
include anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis/dyskinesis.
There is no apical thrombus. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal.  The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation is seen.  There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is no
pericardial effusion.

Result of the VQ scan were low likelihood of pulmonary
embolus.  Work-up for hypercoagulable state is underway.
Patient will also undergo outpatient evaluation for
obstructive sleep apnea.

Since patient is doing well on increased dose of ACE
inhibitor, it is decided that he is stable for discharge
home.  Patient received teaching from the Heart Failure nurse
regarding low sodium diet.  Patient will be discharged on
Lovenox and Coumadin.  Patient is familiar with
administration of Coumadin.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTION:
1.  Outpatient work-up of obstructive sleep apnea.
2.  Follow-up with cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 121**], in two to four

3.  Follow-up with primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], in two to
four weeks for patient to have INR checked on Wednesday,
[**5-13**].
4.  Patient instructed to maintain low sodium diet and to
weigh himself on a daily basis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Elevated left heart filling pressures.
