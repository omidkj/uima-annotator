Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75yoM with a Squamous Cell CA of the Nasopharynx s/p 3 rounds of
chemotherapy, recent course of radiation, s/p PEG who presents
with fever, shakes, productive cough. Per patient and pt's wife,
the patient finished his most recent course of radiation to the
nasopharynx and neck on [**12-10**]. Since that time he has been at
home. The patient has had increased sputum from baseline,
worsening fevers over the past two days, and mild confustion
over the past 24 hrs. Of note the pt also has been undergoing
chemotherapy (s/p 2 cycles of Cisplatin) and now on his third
cycle of chemotherapy having recently been changed to
Carboplatin. During his chemoradiation course the pt has been
experiencing mucositis and has had complaints of coughing and a
sensation of choking with increased phlegm. The patient does
endorse some orthopnea related to the feeling of phlegm going
down his throat when reclining. The pt has also endorsed an
increased concentration in his urine.

with cough productive with rhonchi at bases (per report),
diaphoretic, foul appearing urine. CXR unrevealing, CTA revealed
RML PNA. Pt given Vancomycin 1gm, Cefepime 2gm x1, Tylenol 1gm
PR, Motrin 800mg (via GT) in addition to 1.5L. Upon transfer
from the E.D. the patients vitals had stabilized to hr 90's

================
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Study done today in conjunction
with speech and
swallow division. Multiple consistencies of barium were
administered to the
patient under constant video fluoroscopy.

ORAL PHASE: There is moderate reduction in oral phase, with
tongue pumping
and tongue weakness noted.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is mild reduction in the elevation of
the palate,
with mild reduction in laryngeal valve closure and absent
epiglottic
deflection. There was a large amount of residue within the
vallecula after
each swallow, with minimal clearing despite multiple swallows.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Patient had an episode of laryngeal
penetration with
thin liquids. No aspiration was seen.

IMPRESSION: Severe oropharyngeal dysphagia, with large amount of
residue seen
within the pharynx, and an episode of penetration.
===============
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: There has been little change since the most
recent prior
study with poorly defined right heart border with adjacent
patchy opacity. No
new areas concerning for infection are identified, and there is
no evidence of
pulmonary edema. There may be mild posterior blunting of the
right
costophrenic angle.

IMPRESSION: Stable right middle lobe opacity, compatible with
pneumonia.
===============
 ECHO
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with mild [1+] mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and
may be underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

COMPARISON: CT torso, [**2165-10-1**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet
to the
diaphragm following the uneventful administration of IV
contrast. Coronal and
sagittal reformations were provided.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no central or main pulmonary
embolus or
aortic dissection. However, the timing of contrast bolus, as
well as
respiratory motion significantly limits evaluation of the more
distal branches
and pulmonary parenchyma. There is central right middle lobe
opacification
with air bronchograms, consistent with pneumonic consolidation.
There is also
left basilar atelectasis as well as opacification with mild
mucoid impaction
of the left lower lobe bronchi. The bronchi are otherwise patent
to the
subsegmental level. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
A G-tube is
in the expected location. Coronary artery calcifications are not
changed in
appearance.

There is a pattern of diffuse osteop
