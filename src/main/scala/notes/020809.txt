Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
CHEST PAIN

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-1**] cardiac catheterization- DES to RCA


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year-old woman w/ severe peripheral vascular
disease (s/p B/L fem-->peroneal BPGs and L-TMA), DM2, HTN, and
known CAD w/ 3 stents to RCA, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for an
outpatient vascular surgery appointment in order to undergo
debridement of a chronic necrotic non-healing ulceration on her
R-foot as well as angiography prior to planned R-TMA. While at
her vascular surgery appointment, patient c/o severe
sudden-onset mid-sternal chest pressure that felt similar to her
previous anginal episodes. She was found to have a troponin of
0.2 and had EKG changes concerning for lateral wall infarct. She
was taken emergently to cardiac catheterization where a left
brachial approach was taken due to her extensive vascular
disease. She was found to have 99% RCA in-stent restenosis,
which was stented with a Promus stent. It is unclear whether
this lesion was the cause of her chest pain as it does not
correlate with her EKG changes. During the procedure, patient
became tachycardic, had extensive nausea and vomiting which
required IV protonix, zofran and lopressor. She was transferred
to the CCU for post-catheterization monitoring. In the CCU, she
is chest pain free and denies shortness of breath. She denies
fevers/chills, but endorses feeling nauseous. She does c/o
R-foot discomfort only when bandages are being changed. All
other ROS otherwise negative.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: (from [**1-26**]) The left atrium is mildly
dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CARDIAC CATH:  [**2135-7-1**]-> L-brachial access. L-side not injected.
RCA 99% in-stent restenosis of distal stent successfully stented
w/ 2.5x18 mm Promus stent, no change in distal diffuse dz. pt

CATH [**2135-6-3**]->1-R-dominant system showed unchanged diffuse
multivessel disease. The LMCA has moderate disease (unchanged).
The LAD had diffuse calcified, proximal disease 9unchanged). The
LCX was diffusely diseased with 100% chronic and total occluded

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old female with extensive PVD s/p B/L fem-->peroneal
BPGs, DM2 s/p L-TMA for non-healing ulcer, CAD s/p multiple PCIs
who presented to vascular clinic for pre-op angiography for
planned R-TMA, who developed SSCP, +Troponin and concerning EKG
changes leading to catheterization and re-stenting of RCA.

1. CHEST PAIN/ACS: EKG changes showed lateral ST-elevations but
no acute ST changes in the inferior leads, which makes RCA
territory unlikely cause of her pain, although 99% in-stent
restenosis in RCA was seen on catheterization. Pt is now s/p DES
within previous BMS of RCA through L-brachial approach. Her
intervention was complicated by tachycardia, nausea and vomiting
which required treatment with IV lopressor, zofran and
pantoprazole. She arrived to the CCU in stable condition and had
brachial sheath pulled by interventional fellow when ACT was <
180. High dose aspirin and statin were continued in house, as
well as beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]) and outpatient
Imdur. Plavix was initiated at 75mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week and then
changed to 75mg daily thereafter. She remained chest pain free
in the CCU. Pt has declined CABG in the past.

2. R-FOOT ULCER: chronic non-healing gangrenous diabetic foot
ulcer s/p debridement in vascular clinic on day of presentation.
Vascular surgery resident re-dressed wound at bedside, pulses
not dopplerable. Pt was taken to the operating room for
angiography by the vascular team at which time her existing
graft was angioplastied and successfully reopened. Additionally
she underwent a transmetatarsal amputation at this time which
was performed without complication. The patient had an
uneventful recovery from these procedures and at the time of
discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, her hematocrit was
stable at 26.5 and her creatinine was improved from admission
(1.8). She had no evidence of any hematoma at the puncture site
and her TMA wound was clean, dry and intact.

3. DM2- continued home insulin regimen NPH (15u qAM, 5u q PM) +
Humalog sliding scale. QID FS. Continued home gabapentin for
diabetic neuropathy.

4. Anemia - Baseline anemia on admission.  Had asymptommatic
hematocrit drop on [**2135-8-2**] to 23.3 from 31.5 with no hemodynamic
instability.  Guaic negative.  She was transfused one unit PRBCs
with appropriate response in hematocrit.
