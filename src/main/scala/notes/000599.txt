Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L1 vertebrectomy and instrumented reconstruction.
Bronchoscopy with biopsy
CT guided lung biopsy
CT guided spine biopsy


History of Present Illness:
81 yo M with h/o DM2, HTN, gout transferred from [**Hospital3 417**]
with concern for L1 osteomyelitis/compression fracture.
.
Patient underwent L TKA in [**Month (only) **], then has slow onset of lower
back pain on discharge to rehab. He had no focal
weakness/numbness or pasathesias, and was able to participate in
rehab activities. While in rehab he was diagnosed with a UTI was
treated with ciprofloxacin. Also per patient he spent 7 weeks in
rehab, and was discharged home. At home his back pain became
progressively worse over the next 5 days, to the point where he
became non-ambulatory. Again, he endorses no focal
weakness/numbness/parasthesia, and denies bowel or bladder
incontinence. He said that the pain was so severe that he could
not walk. He presented to the ED several times and was treated
with darvocet with some relief. He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**6-6**] for pain control.
.
There he received a lumbar spine MRI (details below) that showed
likely osteomyelitis of L1 with compression fracture, and liekly
disckisits of adjacent disks. Based on this finding, patient was
transferred tot he [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
.
On floor, patient was sleeping comfortably. He endoreses [**1-22**]
lowerback pain centered over his spine, non radiating. Denies
bowel/bladder incontinence.

On Discharge:

Pertinent Imaging (Impressions only)
[**6-12**] MRI: L/T Spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Compression fracture at L1 vertebral body, associated with
retropulsion
resulting in moderate anterior thecal sac effacement and
moderate canal
stenosis at this level. The post-contrast images show abnornal
enhancement in
the anterior epidural space which could represent neoplasm
(15:10).
2. Increased intervertebral disc signal changes at T12-L1 and
L1-L2 levels.
Appearances can be due to a fracture, the possibility of a
pathologic
compression fracture cannot be excluded.
3. Focal area of T2 and FLAIR high signal on the left at T12
vertebral body
concerning for a matastasic lesion.

CT: L/T Spine
IMPRESSION:
There is compression deformity of L1 with lucency within the
vertebral body. Additional lucencies are seen at T12 and L5.
Possibility of a pathologic compression fracture at L1 cannot be
entirely excluded.
Dilatation of the abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries.
Recommend
correlation with CT of the abdomen with contrast

[**6-13**] CT: Torso/Pelvis w/ Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper lobe lung mass with enhancing components and
small central
cavitation with associated hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
concerning
for neoplastic process. Infectious etiology considered less
likely.
2. Stable T12 and L1 with enhancing epidural soft tissue
component at L1,
concerning for metastatic process.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysmal dilatation up to 3.1
cm just above the bifurcation of the common iliacs.

[**6-19**] MRI: Head
IMPRESSION:
No enhancing brain lesions are seen to indicate metastatic
disease. No acute infarcts. 7-mm focus of enhancement in the
anterior portion of the odontoid process could be due to bony
metastatic lesion given the patient's history of other areas of
bony metastasis. No evidence of impending fracture seen or
epidural mass identified. Mild narrowing of the spinal canal is
noted on sagittal post-gadolinium images at C3 and C4 level.

[**6-30**] CT: L-Spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. The fractured L1 vertebral body demonstrates slightly
increased loss of
height and slightly increased retropulsion. The spinal canal
appears more
narrowed, but this is difficult to quantify on noncontrast CT.
The appearance remains suggestive of a pathologic fracture.
2. Slight interval enlargement of the T12 lytic lesion, likely a
metastasis.
3. Unchanged L5 lytic lesion.
4. 3.2 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is again noted.

[**7-14**]: L-Spine AP/Lateral:
IMPRESSION: There is no change in hardware position or alignment
compared to the intraoperative images from [**7-7**].

Pathology:
L1 Vertebral Body Biopsy:
Vertebral body, L1, biopsy:
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, consistent with
pulmonary origin, see note.
Note:  The malignancy is keratin cocktail and CK7 positive, as
well as p63 and focally TTF-1 positive.  It is CK20 negative.
.
Bone, L1 vertebra, vertebrectomy (B-F):
Metastatic poorly-differentiated carcinoma.  See note.
Note:  Immunohistochemical staining shows that the tumor cells
are positive for CK7 and focally positive for TTF-1.  These
findings are consistent with metastatic poorly-differentiated
carcinoma of lung origin.  The prior vertebral body biopsy
(S10-[**Numeric Identifier 87643**] L) has been reviewed.  The patient's history of a
lung mass is noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with h/o DM2, recent L TKA, p/w severe back pain, now
found to have L1 compression fracture and found to have
metastatic squamous cell lung cancer. Patient had palliative
vertebrectomy.
.
#. L1 Compression Fracture/Vertebrectomy: His outside MRI
sugggestive of osteo and fracture of L1, with diskitis of
T12-L1, L1-L2. Also high grade stenosis of L4-L5. CT/MRI were
performed at [**Hospital1 18**] that were suspicious for lytic lesions of the
spine and a lung lesion rather than the initial suspicion of
infection. A pelvis and torso CT showed a R lung mass concerning
for a primary malignancy.  His antibiotics were discontinued,
and his lower back pain was controlled with morphine.  On [**6-16**] he
underwent palliative vertebrectomy. 28 staples were removed from
his thoracotomy incision on [**2149-7-17**]. Strength was [**3-19**] in all
extremities, 2+ reflexes B/L.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**]
in neurosurgery. Lovenox was started given orthopedic surgery
and immobility. Lovenox does not need to be continued
indefinitely. Once ambulatory, pt. does not n
