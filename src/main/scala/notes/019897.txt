History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] went to clinic today for evaluation of diarrhea
which has been worsening over the last week. She was seen in
clinic on Saturday and Sunday and was noted to have escalation
of diarrhea at that time. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60235**] saw her at
that time, started her on Flagyl and arranged for today's visit.
Her husband called the clinic this morning stating he did not
think he could bring her in because of the frequency of her
stooling. Advised him at that time that it was very important
she come in due to the diarrhea and her previous low K. A second
call from the husband reported they would be in shortly and he
also reported that she had a fever to 100.5. She reports that
she is having pain in her knee because she slipped in stool last
night while trying to get to the bathroom. She has not eaten
today. She has taken her immune-suppression only. Her husband
did not yet pick up the Flagyl ordered on Saturday. She denies
cramping with the diarrhea. Denies blood in her stool. Denies
nausea/vomiting/SOB/CP.
.
In clinic, she had a fever to 98.8. She was started on IV fluid
transfusions, and electrolyte repletion. She had peripheral
blood cultures and cultures were drawn from her line. She was
repleted with 1000n/s +40meq KCL and 4gm. Mag. She has been
lethargic but alert and oriented she is weak but needs minimal
assist getting oob. She was given doses of vanco, flagyl,and
Aztreonam. Vital Signs: BP: 112/79. Heart Rate: 120.
Temperature: 98.8. Resp. Rate: 18. O2 Saturation%: 100.


Past Medical History:

Oncologic History: [**Known firstname **] is a 51-year-old woman who was
admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2187-2-4**] after a period of
fevers, myalgias, tender cervical adenopathy, and worsening
chronic back pain. On admission, she was noted for white blood
count of 233,000 and a platelet count of 10,000. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was
notable for acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic
differentiation. She required immediate leukapheresis and was
started on hydroxyurea and allopurinol. On the second day after
admission she went into a DIC with onset of acute renal failure,
which resolved with IV fluids. She was treated with 7 and
3(cytarabine and idarubicin) with subsequent complications of
prolonged febrile neutropenia, VRE bacteremia, cephalitis, and
mucositis. She also was noted for some mental status changes
concerning for CNS involvement. The lumbar puncture showed no
specific malignant cells, but high monocyte count was concerning
for leptomeningeal spread and she received five doses of
intrathecal chemotherapy, two doses of methotrexate, and three
doses of ARC. Unfortunately, she was noted for persistent
disease and received a cycle of clofarabine. She required an
admission for neutropenic fever. Her day 15 bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy showed no evidence of disease. She was initiated on
conditioning with fludarabine, Cytoxan, and TBI. Day 0 was on
[**2187-5-18**].
.
POST-TRANSPLANT COURSE: [**Known firstname 60231**] post transplant course has
been complicated by a diffuse erythroderma rash with marked
pruritus and dull epigastric discomfort. EGD was done which
showed acute mild GVHD. She was initiated on IV Solu-Medrol,
which was then switched to oral prednisone prior to her
discharge. This has been discontinued as of [**2187-7-11**]. She has
continued on CellCept [**Pager number **] mg q12h and Tacrolimus 0.5 mg q12h.
She also has been on Entocort 3 mg three times per day. [**Known firstname **]
and her husband stayed locally at the apartments for
approximately two weeks after her discharge on [**2187-7-4**], which
was on day 47 following her transplant. She was then cleared to
go home, but continues to be seen frequently in clinic for IV
fluid support and has been requiring potassium and magnesium
supplementation.

Imaging:
ECHOCARDIOGRAMS:
.
[**2187-9-14**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2187-5-30**], a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion
is now present.
.
[**2187-9-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear struct
