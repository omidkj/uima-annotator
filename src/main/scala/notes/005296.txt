Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-1-25**] Redo Sternotomy, Redo Mitral Valve Replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 65440**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve, Tricuspid Valve Repair
with 32 millimeter CE ring


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a pleasant 59 year old male who underwent a porcine
mitral valve replacement in [**2107-12-3**] for mitral valve
prolapse/regurgitation. He started to develop dyspnea on
exertion about two years after his operation. His dyspnea on
exertion has recently worsened and his exercise tolerance has
dramatically diminished. Over years, there has been evidence of
increasing transvalvular gradients. An echocardiogram in
[**2111-12-3**] was notable for a mean gradient of 16mmHg across
the mitral valve. There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation and
his LVEF was estimated at 60-65%. Subsequent cardiac
catheterization in [**2111-12-3**] confirmed mitral stenosis with
a gradient of 15mmHg and valve area of 0.9 square centimeters.
His coronary arteries were clean and his LVEF was normal at 60%.
Based on the above results, he was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted on [**2112-1-24**]. The following day, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed a redo sternotomy, redo mitral valve
replacement and tricuspid valve repair. The operation was
uneventful and he was brought to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. He was started on Amiodarone for episodes of
rapid atrial fibrillation. His renal function acutely declined
with creatinine peaking to 2.7 on postoperative day two. He did
not become oliguric. His acute renal insufficiency was
attributed to hypotension and NSAIDs. With avoidance of
nephrotoxic agents and adequate hemodynamics, his renal function
gradually improved over several days.  The Electrophysiology
service was consulted regarding PPM interogation, showed good
capture and function.  PPM changed to DDD mode.  The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with postoperative
strengthening and conditioning.  Over the next several days he
made steady progress in his ability to ambulate.  Beta blockade
and aspirin were resumed. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight.  Coumadin and heparin were started with a
target INR of 3.0-3.5.  Initially he did not respond to coumadin
and the Heme/Onc service was consulted.  Serum protein
electrophoresis was conducted and pending at time of discharge
to determine the presence of alpha thalassemia.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was
placed on his outpatient regimen of coumadin 40mg q day.  On
postoperative day 18 Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was at his preop weight with good
exercise tolerance, no SOB, or Chest pain.  His blood pressure
was stable.  His sternotomy incision was clean, dry, and intact
without evidence of infection.  His staples were removed.  He
was discharged home on POD 18 in good condition, cardiac diet,
sternal precautions, and instructed to follow up with his PCP
and cardiologist in [**1-4**] weeks.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] in four weeks.  His PCP will draw his INR at 10AM on
[**2112-2-15**] and assume management of his anticoagulation.
