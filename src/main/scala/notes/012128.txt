bleeding) transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] due to GI bleed and
septic shock due to UTI with obstructive kidney stone.

Patient is homebound at baseline but ambulates with walker and
requires assitance with ADL's. He has recent history of
recurrent UTI and had a cystoscopy on [**9-30**] for work-up of
persistent hematuria. He initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED
after an unwitnessed fall at home on [**10-4**] in the PM, unclear if
there was LOC, he was found by his wife on the floor, fully
concsious and with no signs of trauma. He was able to be helped
up and walk with his walker. Following the fall he had a
persistent cough and then developed large amounts of dark
vomitus. He is on ASA, not on coumadin or plavix.

At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] was HD stable with SBP in the 140's, found to
have positive NG lavage that did not clear, was noted febrile to
102, with positive UA and CT abdomen/pelvis showing 1cm
obstructing left kidney stone at the UPJ. CT head and CXR showed
no acute processes. 16g and 18g PIVs were placed, He was started
on ceftriaxone and protonix drip. He was guiac neg with stable
Hct. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] per urology for
placement of drainage nephrostomy.

Patient was last admitted to our institution in [**2168-5-4**] for
UTI with pan-sensitive e.coli. Per his last PCP note from [**8-/2168**]
he was since treated twice for UTI and had persistent
microscopic hematuria despite completion of treatment. He does
have known prostatic enlargement and some lower urinary tract
symptoms and he is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 986**] at NWH for this.
He had cystoscopy on [**9-30**] followed by 3 day course of cipro.
