History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 year old man who was admitted in the
afternoon of [**2164-11-15**] with a fall at home complicated by rib
pain and found to have multiple rib fractures now transfered to
the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory distress.
.
He is an 82 M with hx of CAD s/p DES x4, CABG, CHF with EF55%,
hx of renal cell carcinoma, COPD, and CKD presents with severe L
rib pain, SOB, and vomiting with exertion. On the morning of
presentation (~9am)the patient slipped on ice landing on his R
flank. He took an unknown amount of tylenol #3 prior to coming
to hospital. HE denied LOC. Denies striking head. EMS called and
pt refused transport. Denies neck, back pain but has noted
severe, [**9-12**] pain with any inspiration over L flank. Large
ecchymosis over area. Son reports pt s/p 2 episodes vomiting
with exertion this pm, initially yellow. No hematemesis. Denies
abd pain. Has chronic urinary incontinence. Per ED patient
recently increased his furosemide dose.
.
In the ED he had a CXR that showed no infiltrate, edema, or
pneumothorax. He had rib films that showed multiple rib
fractures ([**5-12**]). He was admitted for pain control and evaluation
of acute on chronic renal failure.
On arrival to the medicine floor he was "lethargic and sleepy"
was afebrile with repirations of 16 and O2sat 93%2L. He had
received no pain medications since arrival to the medicine
floor. At ~2:45 am he was found to be hypoxic with O2sat 71% on
2L. He received nebs and was able to wean his supplemental O2 to
2-3L. However at ~4am, he desatted again requiring a NRB and ICU
transfer.
Also he was found to have a bladder scan of ~500cc and a foley
catheter was placed.
.
ROS: no nausea. no vomiting. no leg pain. no increase in leg
swelling. left chest pain.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus. PR prolongation (stable from priors). right axis
deviation. RBBB. slow R wave progression. no ST-T changes from
prior
.
Studies:
[**2164-11-15**] CXR Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
Patient is status post median sternotomy with wires intact. A
left basal nodule measures 13 mm. Right basal nodule is not well
seen on today's study. There is no pneumothorax or focal
consolidations. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Left pleural
thickening is stable since [**2164-5-4**]. Osseous structures are
diffusely demineralized. There is no displaced fracture.
.
[**2164-11-15**] rib xray - There are nondisplaced and mildly displaced
fractures of four contiguous left-sided ribs (the sixth through
ninth ribs). There is increased pleural density in this region
which could reflect associated hematoma. No pneumothorax is
seen. Chest is unchanged in appearance with a [**Month/Day/Year 4448**] seen in
the left anterior chest wall and prominent cardiomegaly.
Subsegmental
atelectasis is seen at the bases bilaterally. Osseous structures
are
otherwise unremarkable.
.
[**2164-11-16**] CXR - (unofficial) patchy rounded opacities in right
mid lung field and left base potentially atelectasis vs
infiltrate

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 82 year old man with history of extensive CAD,
CHF, DM2, COPD, RCC now presenting with rib fractures following
a fall complicated by respiratory distress. The patient's
daughter confirmed that he was DNR/DNI.  He was placed on bipap
to help with his breathing which was particularly difficult
given the need to balance treatment of his fracture pain with
adequate mentation and respiratory effort.  An epidural could
not be placed as the patient was taking clopidogrel.  The
patient remained significantly acidemic with pH 7.1 and elevated
CO2.  Family members concluded that he would want comfort care
only and did not want to continue with invasive interventions.
The patient was made CMO status and appeared comfortable. He
received morphine boluses prior to moving him but otherwise did
not require additional therapeutics.
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM PRIOR TO CMO STATUS:
# Respiratory Distress: likely secondary to pain with splinting
from rib pain resulting in ventilation and oxygenation deficits.
given normal or near normal serum bicarb likely not a
significant CO2 retainer at baseline. no fever or evidence for
infection however with vomiting and altered mental status could
have aspirated. likely dehydrated as opposed to in CHF. no
pneumothorax on imaging. other potentials could be PE however
seems early in course for this and has no hemodynamic or ECG
evidence for PE.
- cycle cardiac enzymes: peaked at 0.04
- serial ABG: most recent 7.21/77/101
- Chest CT yesterday noted as above
- NIPPV yesterday without signif improvement in PCo2. Still with
myoclonus. Will re-attempt with higher PS today.
- A-line for BP monitor and frequent ABG
- CXR this am as above. Limit fluid today
.
# Altered mental status/myoclonus: non-focal neuro exam and
altered mental status has waxed and waned with the respiratory
distress (i.e. CO2 narcosis) which supports this as the prim
