Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo woman with asthma who was admitted with respiratory
failure. The pt was diagnosed with influenza A and B,
parainfluenza 1,2,3 and adenovirus. She was intubated for
respiratory failure which was likely caused a severe COPD/asthma
exacerbation, compounded with severe viral infections. She
completed a course of Tamiflu. No evidence of an infectious
process was noted on CXR. She failed extubation twice, and did
well after being extubated. She was titrated down to room air
and maintained oxygen saturation in the 90s. She was started on
steroids and discharged on a tapering dose of steroids.
.
#. Respiratory Failure:
In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was extubated several hours after arrival.
Following extubation, pt became tachypneic with severe wheezes.
She received racemic epi and solumedrol but after no
improvement, she was reintubated. At this time, her
nasopharyngeal washes came back positive for influenza,
parainfluenza and adenovirus and she was started on Tamiflu.
Levaquin was discontinued, given low likelihood of pneumonia.
The following day, pt self extubated and was then reintubated
several hours later after she became tachypneic with diffuse
wheezes. Over the next few days, pt was transitioned from assist
control to pressure support. It was thought that she was failing
extubations secondary to laryngeal edema and she had a bedside
bronchoscopy. The bronchoscopy showed "near complete occlusion
of lingula, RLL, LLL with forced expiration due to mild
malacia." After no cuff leak was found, she was successfully
extubated on hospital day #9. Her solumedrol was slowly weaned.
She was called out to the floor on hopital day #10.  Her
steroids were tapered to prednisone and the frequency of her
nebs was decreased. She was transitioned to inhalers and her
steroids were tapered.  Her PFTs were obtained from her PCP and
showed an FEV1 of 70% and an FVC of 106% both of which did not
change with bronchodilators.  She was discharged with combivent
inhaler, advair and a rescue albuterol inhaler.  She was
recommended to see a Pulmonologist through her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] her
blood cultures came back negative.
.
# Hyperglycemia: Likely [**1-14**] steroids.  She was covered with an
insulin sliding scale.
.
# UTI: The pt's urine culture showed evidence of probable
Gardnerella Vaginalis (10,000-100,000 organisms/ml).
.
COde status: Full code.
