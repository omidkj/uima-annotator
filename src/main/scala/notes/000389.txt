Comparison made to prior study of one day earlier. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There has been
interval removal of the left basilar chest tube. Minimal linear
atelectasis is present in the left mid lung zone. There is no
pneumothorax. There is mild subcutaneous emphysema in the left
chest. Minimal linear atelectasis is present in the right lung.

exclude ischemia/injury. Clinical correlation is suggested.
