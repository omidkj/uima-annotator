Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and positive troponin

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath [**10-23**]
Pleurx catheter drainage daily

History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with history of CAD sp MI, CABG and recent MI([**2102-5-23**])
while at HD.  He is s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 and VT arrest on the cath table.
 Patient has recurrent transudative effusions status post
multiple thoracentesis and trapped lung physiology.  Patient had
a right-sided pleurx catheter placed on [**2102-10-6**] and a left-sided
pleurx catheter placed [**2102-10-13**].  Patient has been home with VNA
and has been alternating drainage every day. Was in USOH until
[**2102-10-19**], when he developed severe LUQ abdominal pain during
drainage of the catheters. Was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-20**], and the
pain continued until he had a large BM, after which it was much
improved. Had a CT of the abdomen which was unrevealing of any
pathology to explain his abdominal symptoms.

After dialysis on [**10-20**] and again today he was found to be
hypotensive to the 70s systolic.  A 500 cc fluid bolus was
given, and BP increased to 80s systolic.  Patient says he felt a
little lightheaded, but no chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, or palpitations.  Has had chronic breathing
issues, no worse.  Team checked an ECG that showed slightly more
pronounced ST depressions across anterior leads and Troponin of
1.24 with flat CK and MB. He denied any further feelings of
dizziness/lightheadedness. Notes that when he had the MI, he
experienced severe chest pain, and had not had similar episode
since. Bedside echo revealed a dilated LA, mild LVH, mild LV
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %), RV moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal motion
consistent with volume overload, and moderate PA systolic
hypertension.
.
On review of systems, he has baseline SOB from chronic pleural
effusions.  He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He does
report continued mild diffuse pain in his abdomen [**4-25**]
intensity, worst RLQ.  Reports tremors of hands that have gotten
worse since in past
week.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, orthopnea, PND and syncope and ankle edema.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, initial vitals were: Afebrile, BP
72/48, HR 71, Sa02 94% on 3L NC.  He was asymptomatic, mentating
well.
