History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 28747**] is a 76 year old man with extensive PMHx including
CAD s/p CABG with stents, HTN, HLD, St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical AV (on
anticoagulation), prostate ca and recent high grade MSSA
bacteremia now on cefazolin, presenting from rehab facility
([**Hospital1 **]) with melenotic stools for the past four days.
.
Patient reports he was doing well with rehabilitation, able to
ambulate with the use of a cane and without any shortness of
breath of chest pain. About 4 days prior to [**Hospital1 **], he
reports he started to notice very dark, tarry stools whenever he

Blood pressures were checked at thigh due to concerns about
pacemaker and PICC line. Patient received 2 units of FFP,
Pantoprazole IV and 2L NS. GI was consulted and patient was
admitted to MICU for further monitoring. At time of transfer, HR
81 138/59 21 98% 3L
.
MICU COURSE: Was HD stable, never on pressors. Got total of 7
units of pRBCs. Got 5 units of FFP to attempt endoscopy but
never performed due to logistical issues and relative clinical
stability. Last BM 2 days ago. Melenic. Last transfusion
yesterday, Hct bumped appropriately 24-->28. Most recent VS:
97.0 148/59 75 (Vpaced) 24 100% 2L. Access: PICC and 1 18g PIV.
EP aware of him, no need to see here, f/u as outpatient. Remains
on cefazolin. INR 5.9 today. chronic neck pain from

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28747**] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
including external pacemaker, prosthetic aortic valve (on
coumadin), and recent MSSA bacteremia, presenting with
supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding.
.
# GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and
GI Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. DDx would therefore also include
aorto-enteric fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis,
etc. Concerning in setting of elevated INR as well. Patient
received 7 units of pRBC and 7 units FFP in total during
[**Known lastname **]. A tagged red cell scan was done and no site of
bleeding was found. GI recommended [**Known lastname **]/capsule study. Patient
declined [**Known lastname **], but was amenable to capsule study, which he
completed prior to discharge. These results will be reviewed
with patient on GI follow-up appointment. Hct had been stable
for >5 days prior to discharge, and ranged from Hct 26-28.
Discharge Hct 27. Patient informed to seek medical attention
immediately for any signs/symptoms of bleeding from rectum.
.
# VALVULAR HEART DISEASE/PROSTHETIC VALVE ENDOCARDITIS: Patient
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve in aortic position, also with
Moderate MR/TR. Patient has had prior prolonged hospitalization
with prosthetic valve endocarditis, on treatment with IV
cefazolin. His antibiotics were discussed with infectious
disease physicians, and it was determined that patient had
completed a sufficient IV antibiotic course; he was discharged
on suppressive Doxycycline 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] until f/u with [**Hospital **] clinic.
.
# SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly
elevated INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a
prolonged course and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K
metabolizers. No other clear drug interactions noted.  Warfarin
was held on [**Hospital **] for INR 13, and patient was given FFP as
noted above. Goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 given mechanical valve at
aortic position with atrial fibrillation. INR on discharge was
3.8 prior to discharge.  On date of discharge, coumadin was
held.  Patient was discharged on new regimen of 3 mg
