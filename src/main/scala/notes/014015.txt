L temp bone w/ possible impingement into carotid canal,sig
edema,
SAH, R frontal SDH, CTA:. Mult fx skull base, L occip, L temp, L
sphenoid bones, bilat sup orbital roof fx, L lateral orbital
wall fx, and L  max sinus fx; Diffuse SAH bilat and basilar
cisterns, L cerebellar IPH, and extraaxial hemorrhage R
supraorbital region and posterior fossa; no definite arterial
damage very low liklihood for cavernous fistula via MRI. He had
a bolt placed for 24 hours and was dc'd as he began to awake and
move all extremties.   He required high doses of Ativan and was
monitored in the ICU for 10 days.  He required a PEG and Trach
placed

On [**6-4**] he was moved to our step down unit, he was awake, alert
and inconsistently following commands trying to mouth words.  He
was noted to have clear drainage from nose on [**6-5**] and
eventually required a lumbar drain that was in place for 6 days
and the csf drainage stopped without out further evidence of a
leak.

He had his trach removed and he passed a speech and swallow.  He
as has been tolerating a regular diet.  Our surgical team was
unwilling to remove his PEG until it had been in place for a
month which will be [**6-30**].  He had no infection disease issues
while being hospitalized.

He was noted to have a left ecchymotic eye on [**6-21**] he apparently
fell so a repeat CT scan was done and there was no new blood or
fractures and his prior blood has resolved.

Neurologically he was orientated x3 intermittently he
occassionally he had difficulty with the date. His motor
strenght was full, sensation intact, he difficulty with
multistep commands and calculation.  His judgement was impaired
