blood pressure 157/90, was on AC 400 x 14 with an FIO2 of 50
percent.  In general, is sedated, intubated.  Skin appears
tight, grayish color; no rash.  HEENT:  Pupils are 2 mm, 1 mm

pressure.  Chest with decreased breath sounds anteriorly and
laterally at the bases with wheezing.  Cardiovascular is

soft, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Sclerodactyly with ulcerations on the fingers and toes.  No
lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse
infiltrates, neurovascular redistribution.

EKG:  Sinus at 140, normal axis, positive left ventricular
hypertrophy, lateral T wave inversion.

Chem-7 remarkable for a potassium of 5.9, BUN 31, and
creatinine 3.9, white count 11.9, hematocrit 39, platelets
192, LDH 267.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  Respiratory failure:  Patient
was intubated emergently at the outside hospital but after
discussion with the family which revealed the patient was Do
Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate and that she would not have
wanted to be intubated.  Her sedation was lightened and, by
communicating through writing, patient stated that she wished
to be extubated and that she would not ever want to be
reintubated.  Thus, on the evening of patient's admission on
[**2121-7-27**] she was extubated without event.

In terms of etiology of patient's respiratory failure, she
underwent a CTA which revealed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism, but there was evidence of large bilateral effusions
as well as extensive subcutaneous edema and ascites.  It was
felt that fluid overload and congestive heart failure may
have been the cause of patient's decompensation.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which revealed
severe global hypo/akinesis with an estimated ejection
fraction of approximately 20 to 25 percent.

Patient underwent hemodialysis to assist in fluid removal and
was started on afterload reduction with Hydralazine and nitro
paste.  Patient has a questionable allergy to her ACE
inhibitor and also was having difficulty taking pills and
thus intravenous and transdermal medications were used.

Additionally, patient has an extremely low albumin due to
malnutrition and felt that this was contributing to her
anasarca and pleural effusions.

In terms of other possible etiologies, an induced sputum for
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was sent and is pending at the
time of this dictation, and patient was treated with Levaquin
for a question of possible pneumonia.

Clostridium difficile colitis:  Patient had extensive
diarrhea during her hospital stay.  Was sent for Clostridium
difficile and came back positive.  Patient was started on a
course of Flagyl.

End-stage renal disease:  Patient was continued on
hemodialysis as per Renal and started on calcium carbonate as
a phos blanket.

Dysphagia:  Patient had extensive difficulties with
swallowing food, liquid, and even pills.  A Speech and
Swallow evaluation was ordered, but this is pending at the
time of this dictation.  Patient's medications were given
intravenously as possible.

Pain control:  Patient apparently is on 150 mcg Fentanyl
patch as an outpatient although arrived in the hospital with
only a 50 mcg patch.  Due to the concern over the confusion
of the dose and the concern of possibly suppressing the
patient's respiratory drive, the Fentanyl patch was dosed at
75 mcg an hour, and breakthrough pain was managed through
intravenous Morphine given the patient's inability to take
POs.

Code status:  Patient is confirmed a Do Not Resuscitate/Do
Not Intubate.

The remainder of this discharge summary, including patient's
discharge medications and discharge diagnoses will be
dictated as part of an addendum to this summary.
