Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2553**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, thigh pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 72288**] is a 78yoF with h/o dCHF [**1-6**] cardiac amyloid,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation s/p DCCV in
[**2173-3-5**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], who presents back
from rehab with right thigh pain, SOB, and hyponatremia.
.
She was admitted to this hospital from [**Date range (1) 90274**] from a CHF
exacerbation. During that admission, she had pulmonary edema
with BNP very elevated at 16,166. She was diuresed, but
hypotension was an issue. She was fluid restricted (1.0 L) for
persistant hyponatremia to 120's. Maintained on 40mg torsemide
daily and spironolactone 25mg twice daily. Her dry weight is
129lbs, and she was discharged at 127lbs.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6 72 111/67 18 100% 3L
Labs and imaging significant for labs with elevated BNP
(20,000), CXR with pulmonary edema, and XR femur without
pathologic fx.
Vitals on transfer were 97.2, 91, 104/70, 16, 94% RA
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is in NAD. She complains of
right anterior thigh discomfort, but says it is improved. Her
breathing feels good. She is sitting upright eating dinner.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
Chest X-ray (PA and Lateral): FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of
the chest were obtained. Cardiomegaly is again noted with mild
pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions
which appear similar to prior study. Bony structures are intact.
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
FEMUR (AP & LAT) RIGHT
FINDINGS: Four views of the right femur were provided. No
definite sign of
disease in the right femur. No fracture. Degenerative disease at
the right
knee is noted, tricompartmental with meniscal calcification
suggesting
chondrocalcinosis. No joint effusion. The views of the right
pelvis are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or definite evidence of multiple myeloma
in the right femur.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT
FINDINGS: The right common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and
augmentation. The right peroneal and posterior tibial veins
demonstrate color flow. Subcutaneous edema is noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT. Subcutaneous edema.
.
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Mild cardiomegaly is increased
compared to the
prior exam. Bilateral interstitial edema is improved. New focal
nodularity
particularly within the left lung are concerning for
disseminated infection. Prominence and some minimal
opacification at the right lung base may represent atelectasis
or worsening pulmonary edema, although infection cannot be
entirely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interstitial edema is improved compared to the prior exam.
2. Mild cardiomegaly is increased compared to the prior exam.
3. Focal nodularity predominantly in left lung, new since the
prior exam, is concerning for disseminated infection. A
dedicated CT of the chest is
recommended for further evaluation.
.
CT Chest W/O Contrast:
FINDINGS:
The thyroid gland appears unremarkable.
The mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do not meet size
criteria for pathology. The main pulmonary artery measures 3.1
cm, concerning for
pulmonary hypertension. Coronary artery calcifications are
noted.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the arch of the
aorta.
Centrilobular nodular branching opacities are noted in bilateral
lungs, left greater than right, consistent with bronchiolitis.
These are lower lobe predominant. Larger nodules and
consolidations are noted particularly within the right medial
lower lobe. Overall findings may represent airway secretions
with widespread aspiration complicated by bronchopneumonia or
diffuse airway infection due to viral or mycoplasma infection.
Moderate cardiomegaly is noted. Bilateral pleural effusions are
identified, right greater than left, with adjacent compressive
atelectasis. Ground-glass opacity and minimal septal thickening
is also noted in both lungs which may represent pulmonary edema.

Left superior segment bronchus appears obstructed which may be
secondary to secretions. Secretions are also noted layering
dependantly along the airways within the trachea and right
bronchus (series 4, image 79).
This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Within this
limitation, the upper abdominal structures appear unremarkable.
Visualized osseous structures show no focal lytic or sclerotic
lesions
suspicious for malignancy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bronchiolitis and early bronchopneumonia which may be
secondary to viral or mycoplasma infection. Alternatively,
considering intraluminal airway secretions and dependent
predominance, aspiration pneumonia is an additional
consideration.
2. Cardiomegaly and mild hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
adjacent atelectasis.
4. Main pu
