Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Latex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
right hip pain
osteosarcoma of the left hip

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Radical resection of entire right ilium including
proximal femur (internal hemipelvisectomy), reconstruction
using a dull Miles cable between the proximal femur and the
pubis.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52-year-old
woman who presented in [**2196-12-14**] with pain in her hip and
was found to have a pathologic fracture of her acetabulum
with a large soft tissue mass in her pelvis in the abductor
area with signal abnormality in her entire ilium including
both superior and inferior pubic rami and ischium. Needle
biopsy disclosed that this was a high-grade carcinoma.

She was treated with preoperative chemotherapy initially with
Adriamycin and Ifosfamide and subsequently with Adriamycin
and cisplatin with minimal clinical or radiographic response.

I had a lengthy discussion with her and her husband about
alternatives to treatment which included formal external
hemipelvectomy or an internal hemipelvisectomy with an
attempt to save her limb. The final alternative was
radiotherapy.

After discussing each of these in detail, she elected to
proceed with the internal hemipelvisectomy, and she was aware
that the functional outcome of this would be poor and that it
might not be possible to save her limb depending on the
findings at the time of surgery. There was some concern about
involvement of the sciatic nerve, and she had had prior
pelvic radiation for uterine carcinoma.

She was also aware of the magnitude of the surgery with the
potential loss of function of the limb of loss of her life
but that it maximized the chance of her survival in the long
term compared to radiotherapy. She was also clear that even
with complete resection, she may not ultimately survive this
tumor, but that this optimized her chances. She preferred to
proceed with surgical excision with an attempt to save her
limb.

[**5-22**] intra-op AP pelvis: shows apparent resection of the left
hemipelvis and left femoral head. There is a single metal wire
in relationship to the residual left proximal femur and adjacent
pelvis. No metallic instrument identified. Bone detail markedly
obscured secondary to bedside technical factors.

Intraop path: pending at time of discharge.


Brief Hospital Course:
    Patient was admitted on [**5-21**] the day prior to operation for
preop evaluation & bowel preparation.  She received IV
potassium, a bowel prep, three units of PRBC, and IV vit K.  She
was also beta blocked with metoprolol.  The Patient was taken to
OR on [**5-22**] for:  Radical resection of entire right ilium
including proximal femur (internal hemipelvisectomy),
reconstruction using a dull Miles cable between the proximal
femur and the pubis.  She was given Clindamycin and Gentamycin
perioperatively.
     Postoperatively, she was taken to the SICU where she
remained intubated. She remained on IVAbx, and metoprolol, and
intiated on hep SC.
POD 1([**5-23**])  She was started on TPN.
POD 5 ([**5-27**]) Pt was extubated.  Post extubation the acute pain
service was consulted to help manage her pain.  They continued
her fentanyl infusion and started a dilaudid pca.  The patient
was started on clears and her diet was advanced  to regular.
The TPN was continued secondary to poor nutritional status.
POD 9 ([**5-31**])Pt had developed a necrotic wound on her left hip.
Plastic surgery performed a debridement and closure of this
20-cm wound of left hip.  The drains were changed.  Post
operatively she tolerated house diet but was continued on TPN
because of poor nutritional status.
POD 10 ([**6-1**]) Left hip drain #1 was pulled.
POD 11 ([**6-2**]) The second drain was pulled.

On POD 15, she was afebrile with normal vital signs, tolerating
a regular diet & making regular bowel movements.  She had worked
with both PT & OT, and was cleared for rehab.
