Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**]
Chief Complaint:
status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
32 yo woman with history of cerebral palsy, s/p VPS placement,
and seizure disorder (off AEDs) who presented initially this
evening with palpitations and chest discomfort, and subsequently
developed status epilepticus.  Mother reports that the patient
had been increasingly irritable in recent weeks, and had been
particularly bothered by her noisy neighborhood this weekend.
She also reported sleeping poorly and feeling tired, even though
her mother stated she had routinely slept 8-9 hours.  This past
evening at 8:30 pm, the patient reported palpitations at home,
which did not subside as they often have in the past.  She
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room with her mother and noted
that she was noted strong enough to push open the doors here.
She reportedly stated that her left arm felt like "pins and
needles."  The patient underwent an evaluation for her
palpitations and chest discomfort, which had apparently
stabilized.  She was in the observational unit, when at ~ 3 am,
she reportedly felt nauseated and then vomited.  Shortly
thereafter, ED staff reportedly witnessed a [**2-28**] minute
generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Her head was noted to be
facing leftward.  She received 2 mg ativan.  The patient was
taken to the ED core, where she continued to remain unresponsive
with leftward head/eye deviation; another 2 mg ativan was
administered.  The patient's head and eyes reportedly turned
back
toward midline.  Neurology was called for evaluation.


Past Medical History:
-Cerebral palsy, non-verbal learning disability
-s/p VPS placement at 2 week age for aqueductal stenosis, with
multiple revisions over the years for malfunction and history of
infection (last revision in Fall [**2159**])
-Chiari malformation
-Seizure disorder since age 14: reportedly multiple seizure
types
in the past.  Was on multiple medications over the years,
including carbamazepine and phenytoin; the latter kept her
seizures well-controlled for ~14 years, but was discontinued
after concerns of "pleurisy" and liver abnormalities.   She had
also been trialed on levetiracetam after a neurosurgical
admission in [**2160**]; her mother reports that this was discontinued
due to "easy bruising."  Was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2161-2-26**] for
a
seizure in the setting of head trauma while skiing and was
admitted to the epilepsy service.  Was followed as an outpatient
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**] for several months, and trialed on
Zonegran.
However, the patient discontinued the medication and terminated
her care by [**2161-6-26**].  Her mother states that she has had a
seizure 1-2 times per year over the last 4-5 years, a stretch in
which she has largely been off anti-epileptic medication.

-Seasonal allergies
-GERD
-Anxiety

language skills.

full code, and this was discussed with her mother at bedside.

Family History:
Uncles and a great grandmother with seizures.


Physical Exam:
Physical Exam (performed after 4 mg ativan total, and prior to
sedation and intubation)
Vitals: T 98.4 F    BP 151/83   P 136    RR 27    SaO2 98 3LNC
General: eyes closed, diaphoretic, not interacting with external
environment
HEENT: VPS site in right scalp, sclerae anicteric, MMM, mildly
enlarged forehead
Neck: supple, no nuchal rigidity, no bruits
Lungs: clear to auscultation, nasal breathing
CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, hyperdynamic precordium
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
VPS site appears dry, well-healed, non-erythematous
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated, small feet
Skin: pale

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Eyes closed, not responding to verbal or noxious tactile stimuli

Cranial Nerves:
Fundi difficult to appreciate; no blink to threat bilaterally.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2.5 mm
bilaterally.  Absent corneals bilaterally.  Eyes generally
leftward, though some roving movements laterally and vertically,
never to the right, even with Doll's maneuver.  Face appears
symmetric.  No cough or gag to deep suction.  Tongue protruded
in
the midline.

Normal bulk and hypotonic throughout. No movement to noxious in
all four extremities.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no definite change in size
of the ventricular system compared to the prior study. Two
right-sided ventricular catheters are present, one which enters
via a right posterior approach and terminates within the atrium
of the right lateral ventricle, and the second catheter which is
disconnected and contained within the right lateral ventricle.
No
hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of
major vascular territorial infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is
preserved. Small bilateral cerebral hemispheric extra-axial
collections are similar in size. The dysmorphic brain suggestive
of a Chiari II malformation is re-demonstrated. The visualized
paranasal sinuses are normally aerated.  The mastoid air cells
are under pneumatized.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR: AP chest radiograph compared to [**2162-3-26**], shows
little change. No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural
effusion
is detected. The heart, mediastinum, hila and pulmonary
vascularity are within normal limits. A VP shunt and right-sided
rib deformity are redemonstrated.

Shunt series: nml

Brief Hospital Course:
32 yo woman with h/o CP, s/p VP shunt placement in infancy for
aqueductal stenosis c/b multiple shunt problems and infection
requiring multiple revisions, most recent in [**2159**], szs since age
14 not consistently on AEDs for past few years, now here after
multiple episodes of left-sided head/eye deviation and
tonic-clonic activity of extremities seen in ED, where she was
being evaluated for CP, SOB, and general fatigue in preceding
days.

Baseline sz activity has been [**1-27**]/yr for past few years.
Multiple med trials documented in chart with reported adverse
effects. Dilantin (longest hx) had been on for 14 yrs with good
sz control but d/c'ed for what mother calls "pleurisy" and
apparent liver abnormalities.

In [**Name (NI) **], pt received total 12 mg Ativan, propofol drip upon
intubation, and Dilantin load, and sz activity seen to stop.
Neurosurgery consulted and did not feel as though shunt
infection or malfunction were likely. Priro to this she did
receive a dose of Vanco and Acyclovir empirically. These have
not been continued and she is afebrile. Her HTN resolved. TSH
was nml. Trops neg. Lytes nml.

NCHCT shows two right ventricular catheters, no hydrocephalus,
Chiari II malformation, and no acute process. Shunt series
negative.

Continuous bedside EEG:  background in theta and alpha range,
occasional generalized slowing, no epileptiform discharges seen

DPH level stable 13-14

She should continue on Dilantin 300 mg po Qday (her adverse
reaction
to dilantin is chronic in nature) and start on Zonisamide 100 mg
once daily. She will f/u in epilepsy clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
