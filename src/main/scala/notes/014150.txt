REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for pna, pleural effusion, etc



Final Report
HISTORY: 66-year-old man with shortness of breath and
desaturation with
increased white blood cells. The patient is status post
retroperitoneal AAA
repair.

TECHNIQUE: AP chest radiograph, single view.

COMPARISON: [**2152-7-5**] at 5:30 p.m.

FINDINGS: PICC line with tip at the mid SVC. Interval removal of
right
central venous line. No pneumothorax. There is a stent
projecting in the mid
mediastinum, corresponding to the area of the ascending aorta.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.

There is a stable opacity at the right mid lung, concerning for
consolidation.
There is interval increase in opacity at the left lung base,
concerning for
consolidation or aspiration. There are bilateral small pleural
effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable consolidation in the right mid lung, concerning for
pneumonia.
2. Interval worsening in retrocardiac opacity at the left lung
concerning for
pneumonia or aspiration.
3. Small bilateral stable pleural effusions.
4. No pneumothorax.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
