none in the recent past.  Patient lives alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival to the medical floor, the
patient had a temperature of 98.3 F, blood pressure 120/68,
pulse of 100, respirations 22, saturating 94% on 10 liter
mask.  In general patient is an obese white female in mild
distress, able to speak in full sentences.  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck was
supple without tenderness or rigidity.  No jugular venous
distention was appreciated.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds
in the right base with mild wheezing.  Cardiovascularly:
Patient was tachycardic, S1, S2, no murmurs.  Abdomen was
obese, soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  1+ pitting edema lower extremities to
the knee.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Normal
strength and sensation, equal bilateral extremities.  No
clubbing or cyanosis with minimal pitting lower extremity
edema.

LABORATORY:  White count 21.4, hematocrit 40.3, platelets
322.  Urinalysis was negative.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.0,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 24, BUN 10, creatinine 0.7, glucose
of 197.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Medical Floor.
Patient received oxygen via face mask to keep saturations
greater than 92%.  Patient received q. three hour standing
Albuterol and Atrovent neb treatments.  Patient was started
on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day and patient was also
started on Solu-Medrol 80 mg IV q. eight hours.  Patient was
managed on this course until the second hospital day when
patient was found to be increasingly somnolent.  ABG was
performed at this time that showed a pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 58,
pO2 of 132.  Because of this, the patient was taken to the
ICU for observation.

In the ICU, the patient continued to slowly improve.
Steroids, nebulizer treatments and antibiotics were continued
as on the floor.  Patient received cardiac echo for
evaluation of possible congestive heart failure.  Patient had
left ventricular wall thickness.  Cavity size and systolic
function were all normal with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of greater than 55% and normal left ventricular
region wall motion unchanged in the interval from previous
echo of [**2163-5-6**].  The patient returned to the floor after
two days of observation in the ICU in improved condition.
Patient had chest x-ray at this time which showed interval
resolution of patient's pulmonary opacities.

Pulmonary consult was obtained for more input on patient's
worsening respiratory status who advised patient receive
chest CT Scan.  The chest CT Scan was consistent with
worsening interstitial lung disease.  Patient's sedation is a
possible contribution of patient's psychiatric regimen was
considered and psych consult was obtained.  They recommended
it was reasonable to hold sedating psychiatric medications,
but continuing patient on low dose Clozaril.  All other
psychiatric medications were stopped.

Throughout this time, the patient slowly continued to improve
in respiratory status requiring less frequent nebs and
decreased O2.  The patient was transitioned from mask to
nasal cannula where she continued to improve.  The patient
was also started on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis and other
follow up chest x-ray showed no evidence of focal
consolidation.  Patient completed a course of Levofloxacin
which was stopped prior to discharge.

Fingersticks were checked on patient during the hospital stay
and slowly started to trend upward.  Patient was put on
sliding scale insulin.  At time of discharge, the patient is
saturating about 92% on two liters nasal cannula.  The
patient will be discharged to pulmonary rehab prior to
discharge home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable and improved.
