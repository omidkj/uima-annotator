History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with a history of dementia, COPD, and
dysphagia, DNR/DNI, presented to the ED from nursing home with
several episodes of bilious emesis earlier today. She had one
episode where she was witnessed to be choking after emesis. She

Imaging:
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN [**2103-3-5**]:
1. Bibasilar opacities, concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.
2. Descending and sigmoid colon diverticulosis without
diverticulitis. No bowel obstruction.
3. Areas of lucency in the left iliac bone with suggestion of
increased
trabeculation could relate to Paget's disease, focal osteopenia,
metastatic disease not entirely excluded. No cortical disruption
seen. Focal area of lucency in the right sacrum, without
definite cortical destruction, may relate to osteopenia,
although underlying metastatic disease can not be entirely
excluded. Consider further evaluation with bone scan.
4. 9 x 8 mm hypodense lesion in the pancreatic head, possible
representing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). If
clinically appropriate given patient age, MRCP for further
evaluation.
5. 2 cm right ovarian hypodense lesion. If clinically warranted,
pelvic US can be obtained for further characterization.

CXR [**2103-3-5**]:
Unchanged right middle lobe atelectatic changes, as noted on the
prior CT, raising concern for underlying malignancy. There is an
unchanged small left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are stable. There is no
pneumothorax.

CXR [**2103-3-8**]:
1. Stable right base opacity and increasing left base opacity.
Probable pneumonia with superimposed atelectasis or worsening
infection.
2. Increasing mild vascular congestion.
3. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
4. Intact pacemaker leads in unchanged position.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 110916**] [**Age over 90 **] yo F with multiple medical problems who
presented with vomiting, with subsequent hypoxia and respiratory
distress, concerning for aspiration pneumonia.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
1. ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  She presented from her nursing home
with significant emesis, and subsequently became febrile with
oxygen desaturations to the 60s-70s on room air. Initial CXR and
CT chest/abdomen both showed bilateral basilar opacities, which
was felt to be consistent with an aspiration event.  She was
started on vancomycin with levaquin and cefepime dual therapy
for additive GNR coverage, and her oxygen saturations slowly
improved over her ICU stay. She did not require invasive
ventilation or BIPAP during her hospitalization. Speech and
swallow saw her, and recommended continuation of her previous
nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids.  She will completed
7 days of antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and cefepime on
[**3-11**]. She was discharged with oxygen saturations in the low-mid
90s on room air.  She had intermittent wheezing treated with
nebs, steroids withheld due to agitation and deliriogenic
effect. Her wheezing had largely resolved at the time of
discharge.

2. DEMENTIA/DELIRIUM:  Patient had initially been quite agitated
with sundowning and insomnia.  She was initially managed with
haldol with poor effect. Geriatrics team was consulted and
recommended use of home seroquel, which fostered significant
improvement.  Her nighttime dose was increased to 75mg Q5pm
which prevented sundowning.  She received intermittent 12.5mg
prn doses which helped control intermittent agitation.  She has
baseline dementia, and this behavior is at her baseline.  She
also was continued on her aricept, celexa, and namenda.

3. GOALS OF CARE:  Patient was DNR/DNI during hospital stay.
Brief meeting was held to discuss avoidance of further
hospitalization, though family was unprepared to make decision
at the time. This will need to be addressed again in the future.

4. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Presented with a Cr 1.2. Unclear
baseline, but she likely was slightly prerenal in the setting of
vomiting and infection. Cr improved to 1.0 with fluids.

5. VOMITING:  Nausea and vomiting had resolved at the time of
admission.

6. Concern for underlying malignancy: Patient has history of
lung nodule. CT abdomen shows lytic lesions of iliac bone,
concerning for metastases. The family has decided not to pursue
further work up.

7. H/o Angina: No active issues. Continued plavix, Simvastatin,
Metoprolol.
