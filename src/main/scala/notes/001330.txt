Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
55 year old female with history of metastatic breast cancer with
mets to cervical spine, right hip and history of malignant
pericardial and pleural effusions. Pt underwent pericardial
window on [**7-30**] for pericardial effusion with improvement in
symptoms of dyspnea. Subsequently developed a left > right
pleural effusion, which was managed with thoracentesis and
placement of a pleurex catheter in [**9-29**]. Since that time pt has
noted persistent weakness and dyspnea on exertion, now worsened
to the point where the patient has difficulty with dressing,
transfer and is unable to walk between rooms. She reports having
worsening right hip pain recently, was found on MRI to have
evidence of bony mets and earlier today had cycle [**2-24**] of
radiation to this area with her radiation oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She noted that whereas she us usually able to walk from her car
to the lobby for these appointments she was unable to do so
today and required a wheelchair. Called EMS, was noted to by
hypoxic to 87% on RA.
.
Otherwise on notable history pt notes chronic cough x years,
mildly worse lately with clear to yellow sputum production.
Weight loss (was 200lbs, now 128) with decreased appetite,
weakness. Had one episode of n/v over the weekend with low grade
temp to 100.3. Has since resolved.
.
On ROS denies headache, vision changes, neck pain/stiffness,
nausea, vomiting. Has mild chest discomfort with coughing and
dyspnea as above. No palpitations, abd pain. No diarrhea. +
Occasional constipation. No LE edema. No rashes.
.
In the ED, 02 sat increased from 88% on RA to 93% on 2L. Had CXR
which showed bibasilar pleural effusions L>R and LLL infiltrate.
Bedside TTE showed suggestion of pericardial effusion. F/u
formal TTE showed LVEF 35-40% with increased echo-dense
loculated pericardial effusion and some evidence of increased
pericardial pressure.
Inital VS: 97.4 123 161/92 24 93% 2L (88% RA). She was given 1L
NS, vanc and cefepime for the pneumonia. Had an elevated WBC
with left shift. Admitted to the CCU for monitoring of
pericardial effusion with concern for evolving tamponade. Upon
arrival to CCU pt underwent thoracentesis with interventional
pulmonology, with removal of 200cc cloudy fluid, pt reported
interval symptom improvement.


Past Medical History:
1) Metastatic breast adenocarcinoma: Breast cancer diagnosis in

[**2185**] s/p mastectomy and CA chemotherapy. Recurrence in neck in
[**2189**] with XRT. In [**2192**] known metastatic disease to spine,
supraclavicular node, and right hip. She has tried and failed
multiple chemotherapy regimens, now cycle 1, day 16 of
Herceptin/Xeloda
2) Anxiety
3) Hypertension (has been on lisinopril but stopped on own)
4) s/p appendectomy
5) Hypothyroidism
.


Social History:
Social history is significant for no tobacco since [**2165**]. The
patient drinks socially and quite infrequently with no history
of alcohol abuse.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.  Her father died of a AAA rupture.  There is a
history of cancer in multiple family members.


Physical Exam:

chronic. s/p L thoracentesis. Decreased BS R>L, poor air
movement.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. + BS

.
EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Low limb lead
voltage. Probable prior anterior myocardial infarction. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2198-11-6**] the rate has increased.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.
.
Echo - Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. There is a moderate sized partially echo filled
loculated pericardial effusion most prominent anterior to the
right ventricle (1.8cm) and anterolateral to the left ventricle
(1.8) with minimal (1.1cm) inferior to the left ventricle and
minimal around the lateral left ventricle and apex. The effusion
is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. There is mild intermittent right ventricular
diastolic collapse but no exacerbation of transmitral Doppler
inflow.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-9-13**],
the effusion is larger and increased pericardial pressure is
suggested. A prominent pleural effusion is also now present.
Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is also now present.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the CCU in respiratory distress. Patient
