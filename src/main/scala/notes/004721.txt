Pertinent Results:
ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline
dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.  E:A 0.83.

CT chest ([**12-2**]):
IMPRESSION:
1) Bilateral upper [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] segmental and subsegmental pulmonary
emboli.
2) Cavitary nodules within the right lower [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] with extensive
lymphadenopathy involving the axilla, mesentery, and
retroperitoneum. Small hypodensity also seen within the spleen.
These findings raise the possibility of an infectious process,
particularly a fungal infection, tuberculosis, or atypical
organism. A less likely possibility accounting for the cavitary
nodules in the lung would be a neoplastic process. Dedicated CT
of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was recommended for
further evaluation of the lymphadenopathy and to assess for
extensive disease.
3) Small right pleural effusion.
4) Left hydronephrosis vs. peripelvic cyst. Again, a dedicated
CT of the abdomen and pelvis would be helpful in further
evaluation of this finding.

[**2100-12-3**] LE doppler:
IMPRESSION: Normal bilateral lower extremity DVT study.

[**2100-12-3**]: CT Abd
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated within the right
lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] are three cavitating lesions with central areas of
low attenuation, likely representing necrosis, unchanged since
the prior exam. A small right pleural effusion persists.
Additionally, in the lingula and left lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] are two tiny,
less than 5 mm, pulmonary nodules seen, present in the prior
study, which are nonspecific findings.

The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and
stomach are all within normal limits. In the left kidney, there
is a large parapelvic cyst which measures approximately 3.9 x
4.2 cm in greatest tranverse dimensions. Within the right kidney
interpolar region, there is a low attenuation well circumscribed
simple cyst present measuring 1.9 cm. Both kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete normally. The ureters appear
unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis.

Within the fourth portion of the duodenum, there is a fat
containing well defined defect measuring approximately 1.7 cm,
most likely representing a lipoma. Additionally, on series 2,
image 37, there is a second fat containing well defined lesion
which appears to be in the wall of the duodenum which measures
approximately 5 mm, which may represent a second duodenal
lipoma. The remainder of the small and large bowel appears
unremarkable without evidence of wall thickening, bowel
obstruction, or surrounding fat stranding.

There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the mesentery and
retroperitoneum. Largest lymph node is identified within the
aorta caval region and measures approximately 2.5 x 3.7 cm.
There are multiple fat containing lesions/nodes throughout the
mesentery and retroperitoneum. The largest fat containing lesion
seen on series 2, image 38, which appears to have a thin wall,
measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm. Several other of the fat containing
lesions appear to be surrounded by soft tissue density, and may
represent lymph nodes with central areas of fat. One of these
lesions is seen within the left periaortic region, best seen on
series 2, image 55, which measures 3.5 x 3.3 cm.

There is no free air or free fluid. There is no evidence of
bowel obstruction. The aortic wall is heavily calcified. There
is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. The abdominal
vasculature is patent throughout.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen within the pelvis are
several enlarged lymph nodes along the iliac chains. The largest
lymph node is located along the right iliac chain and measures
2.2 x 3.8 cm. Some of these lymph nodes appear to have tiny
amounts of fat within them. The rectum, sigmoid colon, prostate,
bladder, and distal ureter are unremarkable. There is no free
fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes,
likley related to the known chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
However, some of the nodes appear to contain fat within them.
Additionally, there are several predominantly fat containing
lesions scattered throughout the mesentery and retroperitoneum
as well as possible duodenal lipomas. cause of the fat within
the nodes and mesenteric lesions is uncertain. Low
density(necrotic0 nodes can be seen in [**Doctor First Name **] or tuberculosis
infection. The presence of fat containing lymph nodes, however,
is unusual for these atypical infections. Another, but unlikley
consideration would be metastatic liposarcoma. Fat containing
lymph nodes can be seen in Whipples disease but this is not
relevant to this patient and the small bowel is normal. Given
the patient's cavitary lesions within the right lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
atypical infectious process is favored in a setting of CLL.

2. Possible small lipomas within the duodenum.

3. Small right pleural effusion, stable since the prior exam.

4. Bilateral renal cysts.

[**2100-12-13**]: CTA
CT CHEST WITHOUT/WITH CONTRAST: There are residual small filling
defects within the left upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] segmental pulmonary artery,
as well as within the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] and mid [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] segmental
and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, markedly decreased in size
in the interval. No other filling defects are seen within the
pulmonary arterial vasculature. Calcified atheromatous changes
are seen again within the aortic arch and descending aorta, and
unchanged. Otherwis
