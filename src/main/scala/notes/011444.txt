Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pulmonary.  Patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure in
ED likely secondary to benzodiazepine administration.  Upon
arrival to the MICU he was alert and breathing comfortable on
NC.  At 8am the patient was noted again to be unresponsive with
oxygen saturation 69%.  Carbon dioxide on ABG noted to be 102.
Patient was placed on mask ventilation with resolution of
hypercarbia.  The origens to his apnea were investigated with a
negative head CT, negative LP.  CXR did not show a clear PNA, he
was given antibiotics (Levofloxacin and flagyl) for 3 days which
were discontinued upon review of the chest xray with the MICU
attending.  Upon discharge the patient was breathing comfortable
on 2L NC with sats 90-96%.

2. Neuro.  Change in mental status worked up as above which was
attributed to medications.  Neuro c/s was obtained and assesed
the patient to likely have toxic/metabolic condition, not
related to a seizure or post-ictal state.  He was continued on
his dilantin and his level was therapeutic as reported above.
