Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

[**Location (un) 260**] IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 85265**] is a 80 yo Armenian-speaking F with a history of
multiple myeloma, [**Known lastname 2320**], and multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**]
for constipation, nausea, and vomiting, recently started on
anticoagulation for DVT, who presents from [**Hospital3 **] one
day after discharge with a large dark stool and concern for GI
bleed.  History was obtained from pt grandson [**Name (NI) 382**].
.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**8-6**] - [**8-12**] and
again from [**8-16**] - [**8-18**] for constipation in the setting of chronic
narcotic use (fentanyl patches, dilaudid pca, tramadol, and
oxycodone in recent past) for her multiple myeloma pain.  She
was then readmitted [**2134-8-20**] and discharged [**2134-9-6**] for an ileus
which improved when narcotics were stopped.  During this
admission she was also found to have a R common femoral vein DVT
and was started on heparin gtt.  This was transitioned to
lovenox, which was held [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] for dark maroon stool and
a Hct drop (29.6 --> 24.8) with concern for lower GI bleed.  At
the time she was transfused 1 unit of RBCs and her Hct
stabilized and it was then thought that she had had a bleeding
hemorroid.  Her lovenox was restarted on [**9-5**] and her Hct was
stable at 26 on discharge. She was also started on full dose
aspirin per cardiology who evaluated her for NSTEMI in the
setting of a fib with RVR during her hospitalization. She was
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] and the following day (day of
presentation) she was noted to have a large dark stool.  Per
grandson pt has no history of previous GI bleed other than the
recent hospitalization.  She has continued to have nausea and
emesis every few days.  Two nights ago there was some brown
clots in the vomit.  She denies abdominal pain or diarrhea.  Her
last BM was 2 days ago.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: BP  110/60 HR 60 RR 14  Sats 96% RA.
 on exam she was found to be lethargic.  Communication was with
grandson.  GI was consulted and the patient was found to have
maroon stools that were guaiac +.  NG lavage caused epistaxis
and revelaed initial bright red blood which cleared with 250 cc.
 A second lavage a little while later again revealed blood
tinge.  A third lavage yt eh GI fellow was clear.  She went into
a fib with RVR with no ST changes but T wave flattening during
the NG lavage.  Hct was 26.7 then repeat 23.3.  Pt was given
protonix 80 mg and then started on gtt.  A peripheral 18 guage
was placed and she has the PICC from rehab.  She was also given
Ciprofloxacin for UTI.
.
Just prior to transfer to the ICU the patient became hypotensive
to the 80s and a small amount of bright red blood ber rectum was
noted on the rectal thermometer.
.
Of note, the patient's Multiple Myeloma - which was diagnosed a
year and a half ago - was recently thought to be unamenable to
chemotherapy by oncology given the pt multiple medical issues
including poor PO intake and anasarca.  She was discharged to
rehab on TPN per request by her family who after many goals of
care discussions decided that they wanted to pursue aggressive
supportive care with the hope of eventually starting
chemotherapy.

[**9-15**] EEG:
This is an abnormal VEEG-telemetry due to the presence of a
moderately slow background rhythm. This record is consistent
with a
mild encephalopathy, secondary to possible infectious,
metabolic, or
medication-related effects. The superimposed beta frequency
rhythm
throughout much of the record is likely due to medication
effect, most
likely benzodiazepine or barbiturates. There are no focal
abnormalities
or electrographic seizures recorded

[**9-30**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]:
. No acute infarction, hemorrhage or specific evidence of anoxic
brain
injury.

2. The CSF within the cerebral extra-axial spaces and cortical
sulci is
FLAIR-hyperintense and slightly T1-hyperintense without
subjacent brain
parenchymal abnormality, while the intraventricular CSF signal
appears normal.
While such a pattern may be seen with supplemental oxygen
administration, this
is usually seen at high FIO2, reaching 100% and review of this
patient's OMR
confirms that her FIO2 has been consistently at 40, last
measured this
morning.

Given the patient's progressive renal insufficiency, with serum
creatinine
rising from 1.2 to 2.3, this most likely represents retained
gadolinium
administered for the [**9-26**] MR study. This phenomenon may produce
a pattern of
relatively abnormal sulcal CSF. Abnormal protein or cells in the
CSF is a less
likely consideration, which would have to be excluded by lumbar
puncture, if
feasible.

3. Erosion of the dens surrounded by thickened T1-hypointense
tissue which
demonstrated contrast enhancement, previously. This is not
significantly
changed compared with the prior study. No evidence of abnormal
alignment at
the craniocervical junction or atlantoaxial articulation. Given
the history,
this most likely relates to underlying multiple myloma this is
concerning for
plasmacytoma

4. Stable left maxillary sinus and bilateral mastoid air cell
mucosal
thickening and fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname 85265**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 80 y/o woman w/ multiple
myleoma, was admitted on [**2134-9-9**] for BRBPR, had two PEA arrests,
developed sepsis, and hypotensive despite pressors, and after a
lengthy ICU course, passed away on [**2134-10-30**].  Futher details
provided below.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 85265**] was an 80 yo Armenian speaking woman with
history of multiple myeloma and recent hospitalizations for
constipation/ileus complicated by DVT and NSTEMI, on lovenox and
full dose aspirin who presented with BRBPR. On arrival to the
medicine floor, she was breathing 26 times per minute and
satting 98% on 2L NC. Her telemetry was showing an Afib rhythm
with a HR in the low 100s. She was awake and responsive to
questions with nods and mouthing words but could not clearly
vocalize.  She was also profoun
