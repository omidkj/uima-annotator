Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
67 yo male with 3VD and 4+MR and AS (valve area 0.8cm) presents
to ED with fevers. He was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**3-8**] to [**3-15**] for bilateral lower lobe PNA's. During that hospital
course, he was found to have worsening MR (4+ with partial flail
leaflet and possible cord prolapse). His aortic stenosis had a
valve area of 0.8. He was cathed and was found to have 3VD. In
the acute setting of fevers and PNA, CT surgery was deferred
until outpatient setting. He was discharged on [**3-15**] and was to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2230**] in CT surgery for CABG/MVR/?AVR. He got
surveillance cultures subsequent to discharge that have been
negative to date. Yesterday, he came in for chills, fevers to
101.5 and SOB. He notes an intermittent non-productive cough and
frequent diarrhea over the last 3-4 days. Diarrhea occurs after
he eats and may have been slightly blood tinged. He denies
melena, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or dysuria.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were: 99.5, 101, 109/70, 20,
99%RA. His Tmax was 101 in ED. He was thought to have PNA again
given his frequent history and was given levoflox and flagyl.
Later in ED course, his BP dropped to 74/48 and he was given
3LNS and levophed was started. Lactate was 1.8. D/t cardiology
concern for endocarditis, pt was given vancomycin and
gentamicin. Cardiology fellow did bedside echo; reportedly no
change from prior echo. He was transferred to MICU for further
care.
.
In ICU, levophed weaned off quickly, fluid bolus normalized
pressure. In the ICU he continues to have some diarrhea,
although cdif negative x2, wbc is normalizing on flagyl.

.
CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast
1. Tiny pericardial effusion, right greater than left small
pleural effusions.
2. No acute intra-abdominal process.
.
Emergency Echocardiogram [**3-23**]
The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity is
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous with posterior prolapse,
probable flail of the P2 segment. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. An eccentric, anteiorly-directed jet
of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small
circumferential pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe eccentric mitral regurgitation. Dilated left
ventricle with globally-preserved systolic function. Dilated
right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and
pressure/volume overload. Aortic stenosis, not quantified on
this emergency study.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-3-9**],
right ventricle has further dilated and is more hypokinetic. The
other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67 yo male with history of cardiomyopathy, CAD, severe MR
and moderate AS presents with hypotension, fevers and diarrhea
.
# Hypotension/Diarrhea: Patient was hemodynamically stable upon
arrival and BPs dropped over several hours. With fevers and
elevated WBC, sepsis is a possible etiology for this exacerbated
by dehydration from diarrhea.  Patient was briefly on levophed,
but responded to fluid boluses so levophed weaned off.
Although C.diff toxin assays were negative, patient seemed to
respond to treatment for C.diff and this was the presumptive
diagnosis at time of discharge given history of recent
antibiotics, leukocytosis, and improvement with metronidazole.
.
# CHF: Pt with known AS and 4+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was carefully volume
resuscitated.  Plan at discharge was for readmission in a few
week for AVR/MVR and CABG.

# CAD/Ischemia: Pt with known 3VD. Pt without CP or ischemic EKG
changes.  Beta-blocker initially held with hypotension but
restarted without ill-effect once hypotension had resolved.  ASA
and statin continued.
.
# Rhythm: Rate-controlled atrial fibrillation.
.
# GERD: continued PPI
.
# FEN: maintained on cardiac/heart healthy diet with 1.5 L fluid
restricion.
