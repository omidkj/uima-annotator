Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
For full H&P please refer to Nightfloat admission note briefly
this is a 58 y.o. Female with a history of gastric bypass 4
years ago w/ multiple recent complications including spinal
abscess, osteomyelitis, intraabdominal leak, spinal
osteomyelitis with abscess, sepsis who was initially admitted
for weakness.
.
On review of her initial note it appears she was discharged
following the aforementioned complicated course on a course of
first Clindamycin x [**1-28**] wks which was changed to Levaquin and
Vancomycin. On the day of her admission she was found by her [**Month/Day (3) 269**]
to be extremely weak specifically with lower extremity weakness
but no bladder/bowel incontinence or anaesthesia. She initially
was seen at [**Hospital3 4107**] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as pt
did not want further care at [**Hospital1 112**].
.
She was then admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service where she was noted to
have hypokalemia due to increased K+ wasting though it is
unclear as to why this was occuring. She was also noted to be in
[**Last Name (un) **] thought to be secondary to Vancomycin toxicity (her reported
Vancomycin was noted to be 80?). An MRI was obtained given her
lower extremity weakness and was notable for worsening L4-5
disco-osteomyelitis. Orthopaedics were consulted and pt
underwent a diskectomy, debridement and anterior fusion on
[**10-20**]. Following induction of her anaesthesia she was noted to
be tachycardic ranging from 80s-110s. She underwent a 1.5 hour
surgery which was uneventful. In the PACU though her BP was
noted to drop from 110s to 70s, though she was mentating well.
BP was not fluid responsive and pt was started on Neo ar 0.3 and
titrated up to a max of 0.8. Following IVF resuscitation 2.8L as
well as 1u PRBC post-op (she received 2u PRBC prior to surgery)
she was able to wean off pressors and have an increase in her
urine output. For work-up of her hypotension she underwent [**Last Name (un) **]
stim testing which was negative for adrenal insufficiency.
.
Her ICU course has also been notable for a diffuse morbilliform
rash with palm and sole sparing. Dermatology were consulted for
possible SJS. Given lack of mucosal involvement SJS was ruled
out however Dermatology is still following the patient. The
rash, which has steadily been improving, was thought to be due
to Lamotrigine toxicity given her progressively poor Creatinine
Clearance. Though interestingly enough unclear if Lamotrigine
has dose adjustments based on renal clearance.
.
With regards to her diskitis, her blood cultures have thus far
been negative and she is currently on Aztreonam and Vancomycin
per ID recs. She is still being followed by Ortho who will take
her to the OR tomorrow for posterior fusion, after which she
will be able to participate in PT.
.
She is also being followed by Renal for her [**Last Name (un) **] which is thought
to be AIN [**12-29**] Vancomycin toxicity. Renal are currently
considering possible biopsy to confirm AIN.
.
On review of her vitals in the unit over the past few hours her
Tmax has been 100.2, Tc 98.6, HRs 109-118, SBP 114-149/59-70, RR
24, 100% on RA.
.
ROS per HPI.

IMAGING STUDIES:
CXR ([**2178-10-14**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Renal US ([**2178-10-15**]): Unremarkable renal son[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **]
hydronephrosis.
.
CXR ([**2178-10-15**]):
1. Right PICC catheter terminates at the junction of right
subclavian and right internal jugular vein, without evidence of
pneumothorax.
2. New-onset small right pleural effusion.
.
MR spine ([**2178-10-15**]):
1. Signal changes at L4-5 which has progressed since [**2178-9-17**]
and is concerning for disco-osteomyelitis. No definite epidural
extension is identified, although the lack of intravenous
contrast does decrease sensitivity. Endplate degenerative
changes are also a differential consideration (type 1), but
considered less likely given the progression.
2. Transitional anatomy with sacralization of the L5 vertebral
body.
3. Mild degenerative disc disease at other levels as detailed
above, most significant at the T7-8 level, where there is mild
spinal canal narrowing and indentation of the ventral aspect of
the spinal cord.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2178-10-16**]):
1. Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous and oral
contrast.
2. Free intra-abdominal air within the upper abdomen is somewhat
less in amount compared to the outside hospital CT exam from
[**2178-9-18**]. Evidence of extensive inflammatory changes in the
upper abdomen, not well assessed on this non-contrast
examination. No definte intra-abdominal collection..
3. Mesenteric adenopathy.
4. Left adrenal myelolipoma, stable.
5. Erosive changes involving the endplates of the L5 vertebral
body and S1 portion of the sacrum concerning for osteomyelitis,
better delineated on the recent MRI of the lumbar spine. No
other erosive changes evident throughout the visualized
skeleton.
6. Right lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis.
.
Lumbar Spine Xray ([**2178-10-20**]):
Single intraoperative cross-table lateral image of the LS spine
shows placement of a metallic interbody fusion device at L4-5.
Normal vertebral body alignment and discs. We have no
preoperative comparison radiographs.
