[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
49 year old woman s/p l atrial mass removal and PFO closure
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pleural effusion/pneumothorax - please do sometime this am thank
you
COMPARISON: [**2158-12-5**].

INDICATION: Pleural effusion. Postop.

Right internal jugular vascular sheath has been removed, with no
evidence of pneumothorax. Small pleural effusions are now
present bilaterally where as previously there was only a minimal
left effusion present. Adjacent bibasilar opacities are likely
due to atelectasis. The remainder of the lungs are clear, and
cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for
postoperative status of the patient.

IMPRESSION: New small right and increasing small left pleural
effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**12-4**] and underwent resection of R
atrial mass and closure of PFO.  Cross clamp time was 37 mins,
total bypass time was 53 mins.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on Neo and
Propofol.  She was extubated on the post op night and had her
chest tubes removed on POD#1.  She was bradycardic and required
intermittent epicardial pacing.  She continued to be bradycardic
and required neo for several days.  EP evaluated her and
determined that she did not need pacer placement as she had good
AV conduction and her HR responded to exercise.  She was
transferred to the floor and continued to improve.  Her pacing
wires were d/c'd on POD#6. She went on to experience visual
defects, complaining of a "[**Doctor Last Name 352**] spot" in her vision. The
neurology and ophthalmology services were consulted. Her visual
deficit was most likely related to emboli and no further
recommendations were made as she was already on Aspirin therapy.
She will follow up with the eye clinic as an outpatient. The
rest of her hospital course was unremarkable and she was cleared
for discharge on postoperative day eight.
