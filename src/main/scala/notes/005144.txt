Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
'Don't feel well', hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67yo M with PMHx of CHF w/ EF 25% recently admitted
to the CCU for AoCsCH exacerbation, T2DM, PVD, HTN, CKD, failed
R SFA bypass who presented from [**Hospital3 **] facility not
feeling well.

On the morning of presentation, the patient was not feeling
well. He reports that he felt weak, had a difficult time
standing up and noted needing to shuffle to walk. HE denies
dizziness or lightheadedness. He reports that the day prior to
presentation, he was feeling well, able to attend his exercise
class. He reports chills that started 3 days ago, and reports
sick contacts (colds) at this assissted living facility. He
denies symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, sore throat,
runny nose, or nasal congestion. The patient has noticed a
non-productive cough that he states has been present for a
couple of weeks. He denoes chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal discomforts, nausea, vomiting. He endorses
constipation, not having had a BM in a couple of days. The
patient reports that he has had a good appetite in the days
prior to admission, but he did not eat lunch because he thought
that it was too salty. The patient tries to adhere to a low salt
diet in light of his heart failure history. He denies melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria. He does report blood on the
toliet paper after BMs. He reports medication compliance
(including witht his torsemide), but he is unsure of all the
medications that he is taking in light of the fact that his
medications come in push-packs. He denies PND and reports stable
3-pillow orthopnea.  He reports 3 pound weight gain in the past
3 days. He reports DOE that has been on-going and not getting
worse.

Upon arrival in the ED, the patient had a SBP of 66, with HR of
65, though he was mentating appropriately and able to answer
questions. CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process with the
RIJ in place. EKG was noted to be in sinus at 63 with inferior
TWI new from prior and troponin elevated by prior in the setting
of elevated serum creatitine. The patient was chest pain free
and denied symptoms of shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, and diaphoresis. On verbal report, the patient's
repeat EKG resolved with the inferior lead changes resolving. BP
did not respond to 1L NS, so norepinephrine was started
(0.09mcg/kg/min prior to transfer onto the floor). He received a
total of 1.2L of fluid in the ED. Cardiology also saw the
patient in the ED who felt that a primary cardiac cause of
symptoms is unlikely. A foley was placed. A urine analysis was
also obtained that was negative. Cultures were obtained, and he
was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Blood pressure prior to
transfer 100/56 on Levophed.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient has no complaints. He denies
chest pain.

Imaging:
TTE [**6-8**]
The coronary sinus is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to
extensive severe septal, anterior, and apical
hypokinesis/akinesis. The right ventricular free wall thickness
is normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
extensive hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertensio
