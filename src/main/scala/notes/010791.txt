Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
56 yo F with bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis, asthma, acquired
immunodeficiency, presents with fevers, chills, cough and new
RLL pneumonia.  The patient was on cipro for chronic sinusitis
for 3 months with improvement in her symptoms until [**4-2**] when
she developed recurrence of right sinus symptoms.  Her sinus
cultures grew MRSA, but was not started on abx because it was
thought to be colonization and not an acute infection.  She was
seen by ENT, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], yesterday and found to have
sinusitis with cultures taken. She was given a ex for gentamicin
rinses, but had not started the treatment.  Overnight the
patient developed fevers, chills, and worsening productive
cough.  She presented to her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**], today and found to
have a temperature of 102.2, HR: 125 130/75 and 98% on room air.
Her peak flow was 350 (baseline >400). A CXR was performed that
showed a RLL pneumonia. A sputum cx was taken as well as
legionella. She was sent to the ED for further treatment.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T101.5 P110 BP109/65 R16 O2 sat
97%RA.  Patient was given Vanco/CTX on direction from outpatient
team.  CXR read as RLL pneumonia.  Patient planned for admission
to floor but became hypotensive in the ED with SBP in the 80's.
Patient was given 2L NS, and was redirected to the ICU for
further care.  Prior to transfer she dropped BP's to 70's, and
had R-ij placed.  Received 4 additional liters of fluid with SBP
remaining low.  Started on leveophed for BP support.  Abx
broadened with levofloxacin.
.
Last VS were SBP 91/56, HR 90's, O2 97% 2LNC.

IMAGES/STUDIES:

ECG [**2121-4-30**]: Sinus rhythm. Low QRS voltage. Diffuse low amplitude
T wave changes with prolonged QTc interval. Findings are
non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested for possible
drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2120-10-10**] sinus bradycardia is absent and findings as
outlined are now seen.

CXR [**2121-4-30**]: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: New airspace opacities are
seen in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe,
silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm. A small parapneumonic
effusion is likely present. The left lung is clear. The
cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. IMPRESSION: New
right lower lobe pneumonia.

ECG [**2121-5-1**]: Sinus rhythm. Low QRS voltage. Diffuse low T wave
amplitude with prolonged QTc interval. Findings are non-specific
but clinical correlation is suggested for
drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. Since the previous tracing of
[**2121-4-30**] there is probably no significant change.

CXR [**2121-5-1**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the right internal jugular vein access line has been placed. The
tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. The course of the
line is unremarkable. There is no evidence of complications,
notably no evidence of pneumothorax. The pre-existing right
basal pneumonia is slightly more extensive than on the previous
image. Newly appeared are subtle, but similar changes at the
left lung base. Close radiographic monitoring is required.

Chest CT with contrast [**2121-5-1**]:
FINDINGS: Multifocal consolidation is worst in the lower lobes
bilaterally and is also in the right upper lobe to a lesser
extent and is in areas affected by moderate bronchiectasis, best
seen on the previous study. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with atelectasis in the lower lobes are also present. The
central, mediastinal, and hilar lymph nodes are pathologically
enlarged up to 14 mm in the right hilum and 11 mm in the
subcarinal region, most likely reactive. Central airways are
widely patent. The aorta, pulmonary artery, and heart size are
normal with no pericardial effusion. This examination was not
designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note a
moderately distended gallbladder which does not appear
thickened, although there is mild surrounding pericholecystic
fluid. IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural
effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Multiple enlarged central,
hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes are most likely reactive, but
follow-up CT imaging could be considered in 3 to 6 months to
document resolution if warranted clinically.

CT sinuses [**2121-5-1**]:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post bilateral total
ethmoidectomies and bilateral middle meatal antrostomies. There
is mild mucosal thickening within the bilateral maxillary
sinuses which is significantly improved compared to the prior
study. Small bilateral air-fluid levels are also identified.
There is partial opacification within the residual bilateral
ethmoid air cells and within the frontal ethmoid recess. The
frontal and sphenoid sinuses are clear. The bilateral mastoid
air cells and middle ear cavities are normal in appearance. The
nasal septum is intact with a tiny left-sided nasal spur.  The
anterior skull base and lamina papyracea are intact. The
visualized brain parenchyma is unremarkable in appearance.
IMPRESSION: Status post bilateral total ethmoidectomies and
middle meatal antrostomies with mild mucosal thickening and
small air-fluid levels noted in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.


Echocardiogram [**2121-5-2**]: The left atrium and right atrium are
normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valv
