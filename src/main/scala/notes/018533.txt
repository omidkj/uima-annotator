HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
woman who was admitted status post elective anterior
communicating artery aneurysm clipping and smaller posterior
communicating artery clipping on [**2120-10-30**].  There were no
was monitored in the surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Her vital
signs were stable.  She was on Nipride to keep her blood
pressure less than 140.  She had CPKs drawn that were 156, an
MB of 3 and a troponin less than .3.  Chest x-ray showed mild
cardiac enlargement.  Lungs were essentially clear.  The
patient was awake but sleepy, oriented to day, date and year.
name of the surgeon, smile was equal, tongue midline.
5/5 strength.  The patient was neurologically stable.  At
2:30 a.m. on [**2120-10-31**] the patient developed labile fluctuating
blood pressure requiring increasing Nipride with systolic
blood pressures up in the 160-180 range and tachycardia up to
118.  The patient was given Lopressor and shortly before 3
a.m. the patient was noted to be less responsive, less alert
and did not follow commands but opened her eyes briefly with
stimulation, but moved all four extremities.  The patient had
a head CT without contrast which showed no acute hemorrhage
or bleed or shift.  At 3:45 a.m. the patient was moving all
extremities with bilateral graft, initially equal, but over
the next 20-30 minutes the patient was noted to be not moving
her right upper extremity spontaneously and essentially no
withdrawal to pain of the right upper extremity.  She was
continued to be easily arousable, opening her eyes and
appeared attentive, but had been non verbal since 2:30 a.m.
The patient was taken back for CTA which showed decreased
flow distal to the clipped aneurysm which was treated with a
fluid bolus and blood pressure was increased the 160-180
range.  On [**2120-10-31**] the patient was taken at 5:30 am to the
endovascualr suite and underwent emergent angiography which
revealed vasospasm of the distal left MCA superior division
which was treated with intraluminal injection of papaverine
with good result.  The angiogram also showed that both
aneurysms were clipped with good result.  On [**2120-11-1**] the patient
continued to have left/right upper extremity paresis.  CTA
demonstrated left MCA branch vasospasm and patient continued to
be lethargic.  The patient had Swan Ganz catheter placed and was
started on triple A therapy.  The patient was intubated and
sedated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Included type 2 diabetes, CAD with MI
in [**Month (only) 216**] and lateral wall ischemia, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and cervical carcinoma.  On [**2120-11-1**] the
patient also developed coffee ground emesis and EKG changes.
She had T wave changes.  A TTE showed diffuse left wall
hypokinesis.  Her troponin levels came back at 17, CK was 504
and MB was 6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the afternoon she developed coffee
ground from her NG tube, she was lavaged and cleared after
800 cc.  She had no melena or bright red blood per rectum and
no further coffee ground.  She was seen by the GI service who
recommended holding tube feeds for 24 hours, starting her on
Protonix, checking hematocrit and not allowing NSAIDS.  The
patient, after the bleeding stopped, was allowed to start on
a baby Aspirin for cardiac problems.  The patient ruled in
for a non Q wave MI in the inferior leads with T wave changes
in 2, 3 and AVF.  Chest x-ray at the time showed no CHF.  On
[**2120-11-5**] the sedation was shut off, patient did not follow
commands, neuro signs were unchanged, she did move the right
lower extremity spontaneously, arousable to voice, does not
follow commands, moving the right leg on the bed, left leg
lifts and falls occasionally, tries to bring the left arm up
to head level.  Right arm not moving spontaneously.  Does not
withdraw to noxious stimulation.  Pupils were 3 mm and
briskly reactive bilaterally.  Left eye remains swollen.  On
[**2120-11-7**] the patient had a vent drain placed.  The patient
had problems with elevated blood sugars in the Intensive Care
Unit.  She was on an insulin drip briefly.  She was also
continued on sedation on [**2120-11-11**].  She was not following
commands, head rear, spontaneous movement of the lower
extremities, upper extremities were edematous.  Cardiac-wise
she was stable with some potassium level related ectopy, and
occasional hypertension.  On [**2120-11-14**] the patient spiked a
temperature to 101.5.  The patient was given Tylenol and
blood cultures were sent as well as chest x-ray and CBC were
sent.  At this point patient was on C pap on the vent.  She
remained awake and restless and repeat head CT on [**2120-11-11**]
was unchanged.  On [**2120-11-7**] the patient had head CT which
showed a left frontal infarct from basal spasm.  The patient
spiked a temperature to 103 on [**11-7**] and [**2120-11-8**].  The
patient had MRI on [**2120-11-7**] which again showed evidence of
small left frontal infarct.  On [**2120-11-8**] the patient had
positive blood cultures for gram positive cocci.  CSF had no
growth.  Patient was started on Oxacillin for gram positive
cocci in her blood.  The patient also had CSF from the 16th
that grew staph aureus.  Sputum came back positive for
Klebsiella pneumonia on [**2120-11-7**].  The patient continued on
Rocephin and Oxacillin for antibiotic coverage.  On [**2120-11-12**]
the patient developed coffee drainage from the incision site
on her left side of her scalp from her aneurysm clipping.
The patient was taken emergently to the OR and had evacuation
of the subgaleal empyema and debridement of the tissue and
removal of bone flap.  There were no intraoperative
complications.  Postoperative patient's temperature was down
to 101.  White count was 12, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count
437,000.  Neurologically she was opening her eyes
spontaneously, withdrawing to pain in the left upper
extremity and both lower extremities and had minimal
withdrawal to pain in the right upper extremity.  The patient
grew staph from her left subclavian line on [**2120-11-8**] that was
sensitive to Oxacillin.  On [**2120-11-12**] the patient also had an
episode of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter which required
electric cardioversion which was successful in converting her
to normal sinus rhythm.  She was seen by the ID service who
recommended Ceftriaxone.  Patient also had CT of the chest on
[**11-12**] which was consistent with an acute thrombus of the left
brachiocephalic vein and possibly extending into the left
subclavian and consolidation at the lung bases with bilateral
pleural effusion.  The patient also continued on Oxacillin 2
gm IV q 4 hours and Ceftriaxone for antibiotic coverage.  On
[**2120-11-18**] the patient had LP.  Opening pressure was 18,
closing pressure was 11, 12 cc of CSF was drained off and
sent for culture, cell count, protein and glucose.
Neurologically patient was not following commands
consistently.  Right upper extremity was still flaccid, moves
toes to command, withdraws bilateral lower extremities to
pain, toes were downgoing.  Incision was clean, dry and
intact and there continued to be a fluid collection under the
incision but it was not tense, it was easily ballottable.
Pupils were 3.5 mm and equally reactive.  The patient was
extubated on [**2120-11-20**].  On [**2120-11-21**] the patient was awake,
alert, attentive, stating her name, smiling, showing thumb on
the right hand.  Attempts to show two fingers on the left,
moving the right lower extremity less than the left lower
extremity but still moving spontaneously.  Withdraws the left
lower extremity to pain.  Pupils were 2.5 down to 2
bilaterally.  Her wound continue to be ballottable, clean,
dry and intact with no leakage.  Her labs were within normal
limits.  Her white count was 9.5, sodium 138, potassium 4.2,
CVP was [**2-3**].  She continued on insulin drip at 1-2 units per
hour.  Blood pressure was 165/71, T max was 102.2.  On [**11-21**]
the patient had a chest x-ray which showed right lower lobe
consolidation.  She continued on Oxacillin for MSSA extra
axial fluid colle
