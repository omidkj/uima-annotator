Date of Birth:   [**2174-11-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Management of seizure disorder,
persistent lactic acidosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 20-year-old
gentlemen with a past medical history significant for seizure
disorder diagnosed in [**2195-3-27**].  His history of present
illness dates back to [**2194-1-27**] where he developed visual
scatomas, which began in a periphery and travelled across his
entire visual field over a period of 15 minutes.  These
episodes occurred with physical activity.  In [**2195-3-27**], the
patient had an episode of these symptoms after drinking
alcohol, which were subsequently followed by tonic-clonic
seizure activities times two.  He was intubated at an outside
hospital Intensive Care Unit for two days and treated with a
Dilantin load.  Work-up at the outside hospital at that time
included a normal CT MRI and lumbar puncture.  In [**Month (only) 547**], he
had recurrence of these visual symptoms during physical
activity, but no other seizure activity.  He was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 41071**] in [**Month (only) 116**], in which a repeat MRI and MRA of the head
were performed which were all normal.  In [**2195-6-29**], while
the patient was playing basketball, he developed visual
symptoms again, which lasted 18 hours, and was accompanied by
bilateral leg tingling and left-sided headache, which
prompted a visit to the [**Hospital3 7362**] Emergency Room where
he had a normal head CT and lumbar puncture.

He subsequently developed right-sided seizure activity.  His
Dilantin level at that time was 15.  He was given valproic
acid and continued on Dilantin.  He also received Ceftriaxone
and acyclovir empirically for possible meningitis.  His
initial arterial blood gas was PHF of 7.24, pCO2 of 40, PO
316.  His bicarbonate was 30 with an anion gap of 13.  Later
that night, the patient developed generalized tonic-clonic
seizure activity and was intubated for airway protection and
severe acidosis.  He was continued on valproic acid and
started on a benzodiazepine drip.  His PH at the time of
initiation was documented to be 6.65, pCO2 of 15, PO2 of 138
on room air.  His bicarbonate was 7 on a Chem-7 and patient's
anion gap had increased to 29.  He was given several ampules
of bicarbonate and started on a bicarbonate drip.  The
patient's lactic acid was found to be 30.  A work-up for
toxic alcohol poisoning such as methanol alcohol and ethylene
glycal were all negative.  Electroencephalogram revealed
discharges in the left hemisphere.  CKs rose to 1600 and
creatinine rose from 0.5 to 1.5, which was treated with
copious fluids.  The patient's amylase and lipase were also
elevated to peaks of 217 and 1845 respectively which was
blamed on an idiosyncratic reaction to Depakote. The
patient's Depakote was discontinued and he was started on
Trileptal again while continued with the Dilantin.

The patient also developed a left lower lobe infiltrate with
sputum subsequently growing Staph aureus and hemophilus
influenza.  He was initially on ampicillin and then switched
to vancomycin.  He was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] for further management and was initially
admitted to the Neurological Surgical Intensive Care Unit
overnight.  In the unit, he was continued on Trileptal and
Dilantin and he continued to receive vancomycin and was
started on levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He remained on a
ventilator on assist control with frequent changes in
respiratory rate per his arterial PH.  He did not have any
evidence of recurrent seizure activity.  He was then
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit earlier this
morning.

bronchograms, left greater than right.  An ETT tube is 5 cm
above the corona.

Electrocardiogram revealed patient to be in sinus tachycardia
with a rate in the 120s.  There is normal axis.  There are T
wave inversions inferiorly and in the precordial leads.
There was J point elevation in V2 through V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Neurology:  A Neurology consult was obtained.  They
believed that the patient had a strong possibility of having
a mitochondrial disorder.  Multiple laboratories were sent
including genetic studies which are pending at the time of
discharge.  The patient was started on empiric treatment for
mitochondrial disorder including the use of pulse steroids
such as Solu-Medrol 1 gram q.d. times three, then prednisone,
Vitamin E and C, Creatine, coenzyme Q, and riboflavin.  The
patient was continued on Dilantin and Trileptal with a no
recurrence of seizure activity during this hospitalization.
The patient's Dilantin doses were multiplier modified
according to serum levels and per Neurology recommendations.
After extubation, the patient continued to experience visual
disturbances predominantly in the right eye, mostly
exacerbated and attributed to exertion.  He was instructed to
cease physical activity upon experiencing any visual symptoms
or changes.  On discharge, the patient was started on a five
day steroid taper to off.  He should follow-up closely with
Neurology upon discharge until a definitive diagnosis is made
and a treatment plan is formulated.

2.  Hematology:  On admission, a cranial MRI was obtained
which revealed evidence of new bilateral occipital infarcts.
These are new as compared to a previous MRI on [**2195-6-14**].
A hypercoagulable work-up was pending at the time of
discharge.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  Because the patient's LFTs, amylase,
and lipase were found to be elevated, the patient was NPO and
an abdominal CT was obtained.  It revealed a large amount of
free fluid in the pelvis, a small amount of free fluid in the
large anterior peritoneal space, which was thought to be from
acute pancreatitis.  There is also a small amount of free
fluid around the right lobe of the liver and gallbladder.
The next day, the patient's tube feeds were restarted and
since his enzymes had begun to fall two days afterwards, the
patient exhibited some abdominal tenderness on palpation and
a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed.  It reveale
