Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
woman without known past medical history who apparently
called the EMS on [**2106-8-26**], with complaints of respiratory
distress.  Upon arrival of the EMS, she was found down.  She
was then taken to the Emergency Department at approximately 3
a.m. at which point she was found to be pale and cyanotic and
she was immediately intubated for respiratory distress.  No
further history is available.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Not known.

MEDICATIONS:  None known.

ALLERGIES:   None known.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in the same building as
her son.  [**Name (NI) **] does not believe she smokes or drinks alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At time of initial examination by the
Cardiac Care Unit team, the patient was already intubated.
Vital signs are as follows:  Temperature 100.9 F.; pulse of
84; blood pressure 113/54; FIO2 of 0.5, respiratory rate of
12; total volume 700 and a PEEP of five on the ventilator.
She is an elderly pale appearing woman lying in bed,
intubated, in no acute distress.  Her HEENT examination is
unremarkable with moist oropharynx.  Pupils approximately 2
mm, equal, round, and reactive to light.  Her neck is obese;
it is difficult to appreciate any jugular venous distention.
Respiratory examination:  She has decreased breath sounds
bilaterally with mechanical ventilated breath sounds.  No
notable crackles or wheezes on heart examination.  She is
regular in rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  No S3, S4,
murmurs noted.  On abdominal examination, she is obese, soft,
nontender with bowel sounds.  On extremity examination, she
has one plus bilateral pitting lower extremity edema.  On
neurologic examination, she is able to spontaneously move all
four extremities.

LABORATORY:  Admission labs are as follows:  White blood cell
count 22.6; hematocrit 44.7, platelets 244.  Sodium 141,
potassium 4.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 17, BUN 38,
creatinine 1.9, glucose 249.  PTT 25.1, INR 1.3.  ALT 36, AST
111, alkaline phosphatase 90; total bilirubin 0.6, albumin
3.2.

Arterial blood gas drawn on 100% FIO2 is 7.26, 49, 343.
Initial troponin greater than 50, CK of 745 with MB of 86;
fraction of 11.5.

Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate and enlarged
cardiac silhouette with mild congestive heart failure.

First EKG at 03:36 a.m. was at a rate of 161 with an
intraventricular conduction delay in Q's and III with [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
elevations.  EKG at 04:21 a.m. showed a rate of 98 with the
same intraventricular conduction delay in Q and III, [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
elevations and ST depressions in V2 and V3 with ST-T wave
depressions in V4 through V6 and inferiorly in I and AVL,
with poor R wave progression.

Third EKG was at 05:27 a.m. which showed a sinus rate if 85,
intraventricular conduction delay, ST depressions in V2 and
V3 and less pronounced T wave abnormalities in V4, V6, I and
AVL.

A bedside echocardiogram was performed which showed a
severely depressed ejection fraction of 20 to 30%, global
hypokinesis and inferior akinesis.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Cardiac Care Unit Service with presumed myocardial infarction
and possible infectious process.  Initially, in the Emergency
Department, she was given 80 mg of Lasix, morphine sulfate,
Nitroglycerin, and intubated as previously noted.  She was
also given Levaquin 500 mg intravenously times one for
coverage for possible right lower lobe pneumonia.  She was
then taken to cardiac catheterization on [**8-26**], which showed
a 50% left anterior descending lesion, serial 90% lesions in
the left circumflex and 100% occluded right coronary artery.

An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for support.  She
subsequently had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia to
the 140s with systolic blood pressure falling into the 80s.
As such, she was emergently cardioverted into sinus rhythm
with three total episodes requiring cardioversion with 60
joules each.  She was then started on Procainamide with a
bolus of 500 mg and a drip of 2 mg per minute to maintain
sinus rhythm.  After she had stabilized, she was taken back
for a repeat cardiac catheterization on [**8-27**].  At that time,
two stents were placed on the left.  The first stent was
complicated by an episode of ventricular fibrillation which
was promptly treated with cardioversion and restoration of
normal blood pressure and heart rate.

After this procedure, she was anti-coagulated with heparin,
Integrilin, Plavix and aspirin and continued on the
intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiac support.  On [**8-29**], her
pupils were noted to be sluggish and the decision was made to
begin to wean her Propofol drip and other anesthetics in
order to better evaluate her.  On [**2106-8-30**], the
intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and removed so that a
head CT scan could be performed.

The head CT scan showed marked hydrocephalus with effacement
of the sulci and cisternal spaces.  There was blood along the
lateral aspect of the left cerebellar hemisphere and a small
para-falcine subdural hematoma consistent with an
intracranial bleed.  At that time, Neurosurgery was consulted
and after discussion with Neurosurgery, the family decided to
withdraw care on [**2106-8-31**].

The patient subsequently expired on [**2106-8-31**], at
approximately 03:12 a.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Intracranial hemorrhage leading to hydrocephalus.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Pneumonia.
