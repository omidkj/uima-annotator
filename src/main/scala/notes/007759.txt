CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension and bradycardia with
electrocardiogram changes post laminectomy procedure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 76-year-old man
admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 96229**] service for L3-L4-L5 laminectomy.
The patient was initially evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] for
progressive calf pain with ambulation and was noted to have
severe spinal stenosis at L3-L4-L5 and as such laminectomy
was undertaken.  Immediately, postoperatively, the patient
became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s
and bradycardic with a pulse in the 40s with lateral
electrocardiogram changes.  As such, the patient was transferred
to the Medical Service for further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in
[**2137**] with cardiac catheterization in [**2137**] and [**2151**].  Coronary
artery bypass graft times two in [**2151**] with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to D1
graft.  Persantine thallium in [**2156-2-5**] reportedly
negative for reversible defects with an ejection fraction of 53%,
however, mild inferior thinning was noted.
2.  Type 2 diabetes for ten years.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Bilateral carotid stenosis.
8.  Paget's disease of the right knee.
9.  Hernia repair in [**2151**], now with recurrent abdominal hernia.
10. Spinal stenosis as noted in the history of present illness.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has a sensitivity to opiates which
cause severe confusion.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired manual laborer in the
seafood industry.  He denies tobacco or ethanol use.  He lives
with his stepdaughter.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a father with cancer, unknown
type.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vitals on transfer were
as follows:  Temperature 96.7.  Pulse of 60.  Blood pressure
143/45.  Oxygen saturation of 96% on three liters.  He is a
pleasant elderly appearing man in no acute distress.   His
mucous membranes were dry.  Oropharynx was clear without
erythema.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Sclerae are anicteric.  His
neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy.  His lungs were clear
anteriorly.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6
systolic murmur.  His abdomen was soft, nontender with
notable abdominal hernia.  His extremities had trace edema.
His epidural level was noted to be approximately T12.

PERTINENT ADMISSION STUDIES:  White blood cell count 15.5,
hematocrit 32.1, platelets 148,000, PT 13.1, INR 1.2, PTT
26.3.  Sodium 136, potassium 5.2, chloride 103, bicarbonate
25, BUN 47, creatinine 1.6 with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 1.3.  Glucose 178, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 3.5,
magnesium 1.5.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm
at a rate of 54 and axis of 100, intervals of 164, 110, [**Street Address(2) 98150**] depressions in II, III and aVF and new ST depressions
in V4 through V6 when compared to previous tracing of [**2157-3-21**].

SUMMARY OF CURRENT HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred
to the Medical Service for further management. Summary of his
hospital course by systems is as follows:

1.  Cardiac:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical
Service after he was noted to have electrocardiogram changes in
the setting of hypotension and bradycardia.  His cardiac enzymes
were cycled with a peak CK of [**2126**], but an MB of only 31 and an
index of 1.6.  His troponin was noted to be 13.5.  Another
troponin of 31.8 is believed to be erroneous. His
electrocardiogram changes resolved with normalization of his
blood pressure.  The majority of his CK leak was believed
secondary to his surgery.  On [**2157-3-28**], the patient was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit secondary to difficulty
in controlling hypertension and started on intravenous nitrates
at that time.  He was again noted to have lateral
electrocardiogram depressions, now in the setting of hypertension
and heartburn.  The decision was made to take the patient to
cardiac catheterization after esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Results
of esophagogastroduodenoscopy will be subsequently noted.  The
catheterization showed native two vessel disease with patent
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and
saphenous vein graft to D1 grafts.  His ejection fraction was
noted to be 48% on left ventriculogram.  No significant lesions
were noted.  Decision was made to medically manage his
hypertension and as such his beta-blocker was increased and an
ACE inhibitor was initiated.  His diuretic was restarted as well
with good response.

2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had an acute elevation in
his white blood cell count to 23.1 with a possible left lower
lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray on the day after his laminectomy.
He was pancultured and given his recent decreased level of
consciousness, and recent surgery, the decision was made to give
broad spectrum antibiotics.  Coverage with vancomycin,
levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover a possible aspiration pneumonia
or infection at the site of surgery.  As it became clear that he
did not have a wound infection and the blood cultures returned
without growth, the vancomycin was discontinued.  A ten day
course of antibiotics was then completed for probable aspiration
pneumonia.

3.  Renal:  The patient has known chronic renal insufficiency
believed secondary to his diabetes and hypertension; baseline
creatinine is approximately 1.3.  Through the episode of
postoperative hypotension described above, the patient went into
ATN with muddy brown casts on his urine.  Peak creatinine was
1.9. This resolved with hydration and the holding of nephrotoxic
drugs including diuretics.  He also had a mild elevation in
creatinine after receiving the dye load of cardiac
catheterization.  By time of discharge, his creatinine was 1.4
and trending towards baseline.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  On [**2157-3-27**], the patient was noted
to have brown emesis, Gastroccult positive. Nasogastric lavage
revealed coffee grounds.  As there was a possibility of cardiac
catheterization in the near future, esophagogastroduodenoscopy
was performed in the peri myocardial infarction period.  On [**2157-3-29**] esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a single nonbleeding
duodenal ulceration.  As such, the patient was started on
Protonix 40 mg po b.i.d. for a 14 day course.

5.  Neurology:  The patient was noted to be minimally responsive
on postoperative day number one with sluggish pupils.  His
epidural was immediately discontinued with gradual clearing of
his mental status.  It is believed that he had an acute delirium
in the setting of narcotic use, hospital infection, recent
myocardial infarction, renal dysfunction and possibly hypoxic
brain injury in the setting of severe hypotension and
bradycardia.  By time of discharge, the patient was close to his
baseline mental status.  Patient was recovering well from his
spine surgery utilizing a warm and form brace.  He was to be
discharged to rehabilitation for further physical therapy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 100 mg po b.i.d.
2.  Glucophage 1000 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Zestril 40 mg po q.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg po q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg po b.i.d. to change to q.d. on [**2157-4-11**].
