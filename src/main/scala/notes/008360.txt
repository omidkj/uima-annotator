Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2133-7-14**] Urgent Coronary artery bypass graft x3 (Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to diagonal) Mitral
valve repair (28 mm ring)


History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with no medical care for 20+ years transferred
from outside hospital after he presented after an episode of
sudden onset shortness of breath while walking to get lunch.
The episode last about 30 seconds, shortness of breath resolved
with rest.  Upon interview, he admitted to an episode of sudden
onset of burning chest pain 2-3 weeks prior, which he attributed
at the time to heartburn.  Since that episode, he has been
feeling increasingly fatigued but was not short of breath until
the day of presentation.  He was admitted and ruled in for non
ST elevation myocardial infarction with troponin 0.8,
echocardiogram that revealed EF 20% and mitral regurgitation,
and cardiac catheterization that revealed coronary artery
disease. He was then transferred for surgical evaluation and
continued cardiac management.

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  20% to 25%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**1-4**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
    N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is bilateral
leaflet retraction. The annulus is enlarged and measues 4.2 cm.
8. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
9. There are large bilateral pleural effusions.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epi, norepi, milrinone. AV pacing.
Welll-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. MR is now
trace. Minimal mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 6 and mean
of 2 mmHg at a cardiac output of 5.9 L/min. Overall LV function
is improved on inotropic support LVEF = 25%. TR is now trace.
Aortic contour is normal post decannulation. Bilateral pleural
effusions are now small.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred in from an outside hospital for
cardiac management and preoperative evaluation.  He underwent
preoperative workup including pulmonary function test, dental,
echocardiogram, and plavix washout.  He was continued on
aspirin, statin, and gently diuresed.  On [**7-14**] he was brought to
the operating room for coronary artery bypass graft and mitral
valve repair.  Of note on induction he had refractory
hypotension non responsive to vasoactive medication, see
anesthesia report. CROSS-CLAMP TIME:102 minutes.PUMP TIME: 120
minutes. Please refer to operative report for further surgical
details.  He received cefazolin and vancomycin for perioperative
antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive care unit for
post operative management.  He arrived to the unit on milrinone,
levophed, and epinepherine.  Epinepherine was weaned overnight.
The milrinone was slowly weaned given his ejection fraction of
20%.  He was slow to wake without tachypnea but by
post-operative day two he extubated successfully on precedex.
Diuresis was resumed. He went into afib on POD#1 and was started
on amiodarone. POD#3 he was
