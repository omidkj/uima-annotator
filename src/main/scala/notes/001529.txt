CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.
COMPARISON: [**2178-9-8**].
HISTORY: History of retroperitoneal bleed, on Coumadin, with new
hematocrit drop. Evaluate for worsening retroperitoneal bleed.
TECHNIQUE: CT axially acquired images through the abdomen and
pelvis were
obtained. No IV contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal
reformats
were performed.
FINDINGS: Study is extremely limited due to extensive streak
artifact due to patient contact with gantry. Within the
limitations of a noncontrast exam, the lung bases demonstrate
severe ground-glass opacity with areas of focal consolidation,
most severe in the left lower lobe. Bilateral emphysematous
changes are also noted. this has worsened when compared to prior
exam. The spleen, liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas
are unremarkable. The gallbladder contains high- density
material, which may represent small amount of sludge versus tiny
gallstones. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Small
bowel loops are normal in caliber. There is no free fluid or
free air. The patient is status post G- tube.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Again identified is expansion of the right
psoas and
iliacus muscle with high-density fluid consistent with a
retroperitoneal
hematoma. This measures approximately 9.6 x 17.8 cm (401B, 37)
and is
unchanged when compared to prior exam. No new areas of
retroperitoneal
hemorrhage are identified. A rectal tube is identified. The
rectum, sigmoid colon, and bladder are otherwise unremarkable.
Small foci of air within the bladder are noted and may be due to
recent Foley catheterization. The Foley catheter remains within
the bladder. There is no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
identified.
Degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of large right iliacus and psoas muscle
retroperitoneal
bleed. No new areas of hemorrhage identified.
2. Bilateral lower lobe ground glass opacity with worsening
focal
consolidation of left lower lobe.

AP CHEST, 12:11 P.M. ON [**2178-9-16**]
HISTORY: COPD. Aspiration. Question pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-3**] through [**9-14**].
Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, probably largely
pulmonary fibrosis worsened only moderately since [**9-3**].
Aspiration pneumonia would not be appreciated. A component of
pulmonary edema, not necessarily cardiogenic is likely. Heart
size top normal, unchanged. Tracheostomy tube in standard
placement. No appreciable pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.

LENIs: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.

2-view knee: Study is limited due to difficulty in patient
positioning. There are no true AP or lateral views. Both of
these appear obliqued. Allowing for this, there are no
fractures. There is a knee joint effusion. There are
degenerative changes of the tibiotalar joint. No acute fractures
or dislocations are seen. There is some mild medial
com
