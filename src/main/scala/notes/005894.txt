History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16791**] is a 37 year old man who works for the government in
the middle east who returned from abroad 3 days PTA with malaise
and fevers to 102 after a long flight.  He had decreased
appetite and drank gatorade only for 2 days.  He denies nausea,
vomiting, chest pain, SOB at that time.  He self medicated with
Amoxicillin and Penicillin at home (unknown quantities).  The
fevers persisted and today he became short of breath with
substernal burning and diaphoresis and went to [**Hospital **] hospital
ED.  At the OSH, per patient's wife EKG was concerning for
pericaridal effusion and CXR and Echo were done which revealed
pericardial effusion.  At OSH, BP 129/92 P 127 T 97.7 RR 18 O2
Sats 97%.  He was transferred immediately to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and pericardiocentesis.  In the cath lab,
equalization of diastolic pressures across [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and in the
pericardium.  Approx. 700cc fluid was drained and RA pressure
came down to 10 and Pericardial pressure to 3.  Echo in the lab
revealed trace residual fluid.  Pt is frequently screened for TB
and was last screened one month ago and was negative.  Denies
night sweats.  Does note weight loss of 8 pounds but states that
he frequently fluctuates in terms of weight.  No dysuria, no
change in bowel habits, no hematuria, no CP.  Pt has a rash on
his chest and groin s/p shaving for images today.  No myalgias
or arthralgias.  No MS changes noted by pt's wife.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16791**] is a 37 year old man who comes from OSH with Echo
findings consistent with pericardial effusion and tamponade who
underwent fluoro guided pericardiocentesis on [**9-7**] in the cath
lab.
.
1) Pericardial Effusion.  Pt. was febrile  on admission x 3 days
with SOB and symptoms consistent pericardial effusion.
Hemodynamics in the lab were consistent with tamponade (700cc
fluid tapped during pericardiocentesis).  A pigtail catheter was
placed which drained 200cc of fluid and was removed on day 2
when no further fluid was draining.  We sent pericardial fluid
for cultures. Gram stain negative from pericardial fluid but
culture was positive for coag negative staph (which we feel was
a likely contaminant).  We sent pericardial fluid for [**Doctor First Name **] and RF
which were negative.  AFB smear was negative and acid fast
culture was still pending at time of discharge.  Urine protein
levels were not consistent with nephrotic syndrome.  TSH was
within normal range.  CXR revealed an area of consolidation
consistent with a pneumonia.  In addition, the recent stab wound
to his flank presented a likely nidus of bacterial infection.
The patient was treated with IV Ceftriaxone and PO Azithromycin
for broad spectrum coverage of a presumed bacterial pneumonia.
Upon discharge, this was changed to PO Cefepoxime for a total of
a two week course and PO Azithromycin was continued for a total
of 5 days.  ID was consulted re: the pericarditis and felt that
this could be pneumococcal in origin (esp. since he is s/p
splenectomy), and given the fact that he self medicated for
several days, this could explain cultures being negative from
the day of admission.  Repeat echo showed small residual
effusion in the pericardium.
   .
2) Fevers and malaise.  Pt was febrile to 102 on day 2 of this
admission.  This was presumed to be from a community acquired
pneumonia.  Antibiotics as described above were administered.
Pt was afebrile for 24 hours prior to discharge.
.
3) Disposition.  Pt requested to be discharged home instead of
extended in-hospital observation with continuation of IV
antibiotics because he is scheduled to return to the Middle East
in one week's time.  The risks of discontinuing hospital care
were discussed and understood by the patient and his wife at the
time of discharge.  He was also given a prescription for
levofloxacin to bring with him on his travels to take
prophylactically should he become febrile as a bridge to
immediate treatment by a physician.
