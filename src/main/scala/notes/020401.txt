Imaging:
Ultrasound 9/2:1. Visual focal narrowing in the proximal main
portal vein, with corresponding velocity change and turbulent/
helical flow distal to the area of narrowing. While the
significance of the velocity change is uncertain, this change
combined with the visible focal narrowing is concerning for
portal vein stenosis.
2. Interval development of moderate ascites.
3. Probable subcapsular hematoma in the posterior right hepatic
lobe.
\
CT [**10-10**]: Area of stenosis at the proximal main portal vein as
seen on recent US. This measures 4mm at its narrowest. However,
patent hepatic vasculature, no thrombus seen. Subcapsular
hepatic hematoma at posterior right lobe, 6.3 x 4 cm, with
little change in size from previous ultrasound study. Moderate
ascites

ERCP [**10-11**]:
Images demonstrate cannulation of the common bile duct with
narrowing seen at the anastomotic site in the CBD. There is no
evidence of leakage or
fistulization. The cystic and intrahepatic bile ducts are well
visualized
without evidence of filling defects or dilatation. Balloon
angioplasty and
plastic biliary stenting were performed. Please refer to the
operative note for further details.

ERCP Procedure Note:Antrum deformity  Smooth narrowing at the
site of anastamosis which could be due to edema from recent OLTx
Single biliary stent placed across the narrowing due to
possibility of cholangitis

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the transplant surgery service.  She
underwent liver ultrasound and biopsy.  See results section.
She also had a CTA of her liver which confirmed PV stenosis at
the anastamosis.  Due to a concern for stenosis of her bile duct
anastamosis as well from the ultrasound images she underwent
ERCP and a stent was placed.  Blood cultures from [**10-10**] showed
ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE (ESBL, sensitive to meropenem).  She had a
replacement of her dobhoff (postpyloric) done the following day
as well as a PICC line placed given a need for IV antibiotics
for her bacteremia.

Her TF were resumed post-dobhoff and she was tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating independently, and tolerating her
immunosuppression medications.  Her LFTs improved upon admission
and continued improvement and stabilization through her hospital
stay.  She was discharged to home on [**10-13**] with plans to return to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 for admission Tuesday morning 6am for a planned venogram
for her PV stenosis.  She was discharged on Tacrolimus 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
A tacrolimus blood level will be checked upon admission on
Tuesday.  Her steroid taper was at 15mg on discharge (1st day of
15).
