Service:  Internal Medicine, [**Location (un) **] Firm

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A subdural hematoma/subarachnoid
hemorrhage; status post fall times two.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with
hypertension, coronary artery disease (status post coronary
artery bypass graft), history of vasovagal syncope since
childhood, and atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin) who
presented initially to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2176-1-7**];
status post fall times two.

He initially fell two days prior to presentation and hit his
forehead.  On the day of presentation, he fell for a second
time and banged his head on the occipital area.

At [**Hospital **] Hospital, he was found to have a subdural hematoma
and a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with
a shear injury in this same distribution.  He was reversed
with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma secondary to
coagulopathy induced by Coumadin use.  While in the Intensive
Care Unit at [**Hospital **] Hospital he was noted to have an
alteration in mental status; however, this was thought
secondary to the patient receiving 1 mg of Ativan the night
before.  He also had desaturations with an arterial blood gas
showing 7.43/48/67 on a 35% face mask.  No clear pulmonary
pathology was noted on a chest x-ray.

He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic
resonance angiography of the head which showed some "brain
stem edema" and a "questionable vascular abnormality on the
right, possibly representing an aneurysm in the cerebral
vasculature."

A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained at the outside
hospital and recommended that because the images were not
completely clear that he be transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation of computed
tomography angiogram.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] he was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he was
monitored overnight.  After consultation with the
Neurosurgery team, it was felt that the probability of a
vascular lesion was small; and, therefore, a computed
tomography angiogram was deferred.  He was stabilized in the
Intensive Care Unit and transferred out to the Neurosurgery
floor on hospital day two.

Due to his continued oxygen requirement, a repeat chest x-ray
was performed which showed mild congestive heart failure as
well as right lower lobe and left lower lobe collapse versus
consolidation.

Given the alteration of his mental status it was felt that he
was probably aspiration; and, therefore, a provisional
diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis was
made.  A video swallowing study was performed which found
pharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration with thin liquids.

Therefore, on [**2176-1-17**], he was transferred to the
Medicine Service for management of congestive heart failure
and an evaluation for aspiration pneumonia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on
transfer revealed temperature was 95.6, blood pressure was
146/70, heart rate was 72, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen
saturation was 97% on 3 liters and 84% on room air.  In
general, the patient was alert and in no apparent distress.
He was mildly tachypneic and was arousable but did not follow
commands.  On Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
his bilateral pupils were pinpoint.  His mucous membranes
were dry.  Jugular venous pulsation was at 10 cm to 12 cm.
Chest examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles were
noted (right greater than left) with diffuse rhonchi (also
right side greater than left side).  Cardiovascular
examination demonstrated an irregularly irregular with a 2/6
systolic murmur.  No rubs were noted.  The abdominal
examination revealed soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Normal active bowel sounds.  Extremity examination
demonstrated no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  On neurologic
examination, he not cooperative with a majority of the
examination.  On occasion he opened his eyes to command.  He
was responsive to sternal rub.  He mumbled incoherently for
the majority of the time; however, he answered questions in
simple 1-word to 2-word answers on occasion.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
values on transfer revealed sodium was 141, potassium was
4.5, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea
nitrogen was 38, creatinine was 1.4, and blood glucose was
140.  White blood cell count was 6.8, hematocrit was 32.8,
and platelets were 174.  INR was 1.6 (down from a high of 1.8
on admission).

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING STUDIES:
1.  A posterior/anterior and lateral chest x-ray on [**2176-1-16**] revealed mild congestive heart failure, right lower
lobe and left lower lobe areas of consolidation versus
collapse.

2.  A computed tomography of the head without contrast on
[**2176-1-9**] revealed an acute hemorrhage of 2.2 cm in
the left ambient cistern.  No shift of midline structures.
No blood in the ventricles.  A minimal degree of blood and
cortical sulci in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres.  No
vascular infarctions.  Stable compared to examination on the
previous day.

3.  A video pharyngeal swallowing study revealed normal
chewing and bolus formation with delayed epiglottic
.................. and laryngeal elevation.  Aspiration noted
with thin liquids.  No cough induced by aspiration.  No
evidence Zenker diverticulum.

4.  An upper extremity venous Doppler to evaluate for right
arm swelling showed no evidence of right upper extremity deep
venous thrombosis.

5.  A transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2176-1-11**]
revealed an ejection fraction of 40%, mild nonobstructive
focal hypertrophy at the base of the septum, hypokinesis of
the intraventricular septum and apex, 1+ aortic
regurgitation, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation (however, likely
underestimated secondary to annuloplasty ring), 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation, moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.

IMPRESSION:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male status post fall
times two leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural
hematoma secondary to Coumadin use with a history of coronary
artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension now with evidence
of mild congestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was transferred to the Medicine Service for
percutaneous endoscopic gastro
