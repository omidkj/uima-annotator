History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 43yo M with history of morbid obesity and possibly
DM and HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2137-6-14**] with
dyspnea on exertion, abdominal pain, and intermittent chest
discomfort for a few days which led him to go to his PCP's
office that day, from where he was referred to the ED.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], his initial VS in ED were notable for HR 116, SpO2
92% 4L NC, BP 145/99. Initial labs were notable for WBC 9.9, Hct
41.8, Cr 1.1, BNP 343 (ULN 100), TroI <0.06, d-dimer 831. His
EKG showed sinus tach with S1Q3T3. Initial CXR showed no
infiltrates. He had a V/Q scan that was read as low probability
for PE (could not get CTA [**1-16**] habitus). LENIs were negative for
DVT b/l. Pulm was consulted and recommended anticoagulation and
BiPAP. He was started on a heparin gtt and received 2 doses of
Lovenox 150mg (heparin gtt stopped prior to intubation).
Warfarin 7.5mg x1 was given on [**6-15**]. TTE was limited but showed
preserved LV function with EF 70%, concentric LVH, RV
hypokinesis, and mild-mod pulm HTN. He was admitted to the floor
for ROMI (TroI neg x3).
.
He was transferred to the ICU on [**6-15**], and a R subclavian CVL was
placed for access issues. A CXR on [**6-16**] AM showed multifocal
patchy opacities, worsening on the right, most likely multifocal
PNA vs atypical CHF or ARDS. WBC noted to be 15 at that time. He
received Zosyn x1 and had a Foley placed with cloudy urine
returning which was concerning for a UTI (no urine output since
last night per report). His ABG was 7.42/38/46 on NRB.  He was
intubated in the OR given concern for difficult intubation [**1-16**]
habitus and low pO2 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. Initial vent settings were TV=1000ml and PEEP of 10,
which was changed to TV=750mL and PEEP of 20.
.
In the MICU, the patient is intubated. He received paralytics
during intubation but no sedative drip was started. He is not
responsive to commands.
.
Review of systems:  Unobtainable [**1-16**] intubation. Mother denies
fever or chills prior to OSH presentation, did endorse cold-like
symptoms at that time.

Imaging:
Renal US [**6-18**]-The right kidney measures 12.5, the left kidney
measures 12.1 cm without evidence of hydronephrosis, stones or
masses bilaterally. The urinary bladder is emptied and a Foley
catheter is seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.

Echo (TEE) [**6-19**]-IMPRESSION: Linear structure in the descending
thoracic aorta as described above, cannot exclude aortic
dissection. If clinically indicated, a different imaging
modality could be pursued. Mildly depressed global left
ventricular function with right ventricular dilatation and
moderately depressed function. No evidence of endocarditis or
abscess.

EEG [**6-21**]-IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU
monitoring study because of diffuse slowing over both
hemispheres suggestive of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
In addition there is higher voltage, slower waves over the left
hemisphere suggestive of more severe independent
dysfunction over the left hemisphere. This could clinically
correlate
with structural or physiologic lesion in the left hemisphere.


Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-6-16**] 2:26
PM

The endotracheal tube lies 2.6 cm from the carinal angle. The
tip of the
subclavian line lies in the upper SVC. Opacities are present in
the right
perihilar region and these could indicate failure or
bronchopneumonia.
Costophrenic angles are sharp, so pneumonia is perhaps favored.
