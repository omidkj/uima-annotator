Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26258**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-7-31**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to four vessels and a mitral valve repair. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, he
had awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On
postoperative day one he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. Aspirin, a statin and beta blocker were
resumed. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight.
The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
his postoperative strength and mobility.  Postoperative course
was uneventful and the patient was discharged on POD 4.  He was
discharged to [**Hospital 3548**] [**Hospital 3549**] Rehab, as he lives alone.  He did
develop some sternal drainage, and was discharged on keflex.
