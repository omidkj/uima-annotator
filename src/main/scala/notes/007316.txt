Chief Complaint:
confusion

mechanical ventilation via trach

History of Present Illness:
77yo woman with vent dependency, hx of COPD, sleep apnea here
with increasing confusion at NH. She takes insulin and
reportedly oral hypogylcemics in the NH. FS found to be 16 so
given 2 amps of D50. Also received 2 amps narcan. Minimal
response although BS up to 146. Reportedly still not at
baseline. Notably recent labs include INR 7.2 on [**10-8**] and
guaiac neg on [**10-11**], HCT 28 on [**10-11**].
.
Spoke with family: they report that she has been increasingly
confused and has almost daily episodes of "deep sleep." She had
her dobhoff removed 2 wks ago and has been taking very poor PO
intake. Yesterday though she was reportedly more interactive and
tolerating better PO intake.
.
pt has been on clinda and levaquin for PNA until yesterday then
[**Last Name (un) 2830**] started for "growth in sputum." She also has been treated
with PO vanco for c diff.
.
In the ED: VS: HR 88 BP 120/75 O2 100%. Exam responds to verbal
stimuli. OB negative, Head CT neg for hemorrhage or shift. CXR
showed stable pleural effusion R>L. Labs showed WBC 13 w 89%
polys, U/A largely negative, ARF (baseline Cr 0.6), HCT 23 (down
from 30s). Glucose initially 54. She was given 2 amps D50 and a
D5 gtt. Gluc fluctuated between 49 to 201. She also received
octreotide to try to reverse sulfonyurea. Her Afib was poorly
rate controlled and increased to HR 120s. Received IV dilt 10x1
and PO dilt 30 x1. BP dropped slightly to 100/50s from 130s/60s
and she received total of 1000 NS and 500 cc D5 gtt. Also
ordered for 2u pRBCs for HCT of 23.
.
Currently, she appears comfortable but does not verbalize.

Brief Hospital Course:
77yo Italian speaking woman with hx of OSA, obesity, afib, DM
here for worsening confusion, poor PO intake, and hypoglycemia.
Hospital course by problem:
.
# Confusion:
Ddx included hypoglycemia, sedating medications, infection,
central neuro process, malnutrition., hypercarbia.  Initially,
mental status improved with minimal intervention.  Her blood
glucose was monitored closely and infectious w/u as below.  Then
on [**10-16**], she developed increased somnulence.  Repeat head CT
negative.  ABG showed slight increase hypercarbia.  Repeat blood
cx NGTD.  We optimized her ventilation by placing her on SIMV on
[**10-16**] and her ms improved by [**10-17**] back to baseline.  We then
gradually restarted her antipsychotic medications.
.
# Resp failure:
Hx of OSA and COPD now with trach. She is reportedly on 15/5
BiPAP at night but has been recently on it all day at rehab.  In
the MICU, she was on trach collar on [**10-15**] but placed on SIMV on
[**10-16**] as above.  She then tolerated trach collar for >8h on
[**10-17**] but returned to SIMV at night.  She had mild hypercarbia
but we did not clearly believe this was cause of her delirium.
We continued her inhalers and oral care.  By [**2184-10-18**], she was
tolerating the trach mask well, when awake.  She was maintained
on SIMV when asleep at night. She was gently diuresed with PO
Lasix, and will continue this at rehab.
.
# ID:
Elevated WBC on admission and has recently been treated for many
infections.  Recent cx data from [**Hospital1 **] include sputum w
stenotrophonomas, acinetobacter, and pseudomonas.  She was
discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-1**] with cefepime and vanco to complete
course of PNA rx.  She then was on levaquin and clinda for PNA
but switched to [**Last Name (un) 2830**] on [**10-13**].  Also has hx of C. diff and MRSA
PNA.  She was also on PO vanco for  c diff.  On presentation, we
initially covered her broadly with cefepime, vanco, and PO
vanco.  Given stable resp status, we stopped antibiotics within
24h, except we continued CDiff treatment with PO flagyl. Blood
cultures remained negative.
- We did attempt thoracentesis of right sided pleural effusion
to help guage therapy.  This was unsuccessful and we were unable
to get fluid.
- A sputum culture grew Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, with
sensitivities similar to what had been obtained at rehab.  She
had no clear infiltrate on chest CT, but given her initial
respiratory failure, we empirically began a 7-day course of
meropenem (for the Pseudomonas) and tobramycin (for the
Acinetobacter) for presumed tracheobronchitis.  Her respiratory
status immproved with these antibiotics, and she will complete a
7-day course.
****She will need trough and peak tobramycin levels drawn at
rehab to monitor for both therapeutic and toxic levels.****
- We continued PO flagyl for her C. Diff colitis; she will
continue this until 14 days after completion of all other
antibiotics.
- Lactate remained low.
.
# Anemia:
Baseline Hct 30-34, but was down to 21 on presentation. OB neg
stool but she has not been on PPI.  NGL negative.  Required 2u
PRBCs in the Emergency Dept to maintain hct >22.  Her hematocrit
remained stable in the mid-/high-20s, and no further
transfusions were needed.  Iron studies not c/w iron def anemia.
 retic count quite low suggestive of marrow suppression.
Hemolysis labs negative.
.
# Hypotension:
Baseline appears
