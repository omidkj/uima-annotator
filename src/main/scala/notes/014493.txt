TTE [**2117-5-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal
septum. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior septum
and severe hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall (multivessel
CAD). There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 35%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate calcific aortic stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-12-9**], LV
function is slightly worse. The other findings are similar.

CXR [**2117-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Small new bilateral pleural
effusions. 2. Enlarged cardiac silhouette. Recommend further
evaluation with echocardiogram to evaluate for pericardial
effusion

Microbiology:
[**2117-5-31**]:  URINE CULTURE NEGATIVE

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M w/ significant CAD s/p PCI, ischemic cardiomyopathy
(last EF 40% in [**12-12**]), hx of colon cancer s/p resection, DM II
and hx of HTN who presented with dyspnea due to decompensated
heart failure that improved with diuresis of 5kg.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: patient was volume
overloaded on exam on admission with tachypnea to the point of
not being able to speak more than a couple of words in a row. He
was directly admitted from his cardiologists office for IV
diuresis.  He was started on a IV lasix drip for diuresis at a
very low rate, however his BPs was dropping to 70s systolically
(asymptomatically) so he was transferred to the CCU for
monitoring during diuresis.   He had a repeat TTE to evaluate
his aortic stenosis and EF. The likely source of his
decompensation is a combination of his high sodium diet and his
multiple PACs on his EKG/telemetry.
His discharge weight was 66.1kg.At discharge patient is speaking
in full sentences without problems and lungs just have scattered
crackles at the bases, and trace peripheral edema to the ankles
bilaterally. He was counseled in low sodium diets, he showed
some resistance to doing this and it is unclear if he was truely
ready to change this diet.  His family was also counseled on
these dietary issues.
-Medication changes:
1. Furosemide increased from 20mg po once a day to 40mg po twice
a day
2. His Lisinopril was held due to low blood pressures (sBP of
80-90s). This can be restarted as an outpatient pending his
blood pressure follow-up
3. He is not on a beta blocker currently which
