CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ASPVD, dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 87-year-old man with ASPVD,
dyspnea on exertion over the past year. He has had near
syncope 3 to 4 times. He is referred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization.

This 87-year-old man with dyspnea on exertion after 50 to 100
feet with known aortic stenosis undergoing cardiac
catheterization on the day of admission which revealed an
aortic valve area of 0.8 cm  squared, as well as calcified
left main without stenosis, 95% LAD, 40% circumflex, after
the OM and osteostenosis of 50 to 60% with mid lesion of 99%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medial history is
significant for permanent pacer done in [**2118-4-1**] for
syncope and bradycardia, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in
[**2117-11-1**], left CEA in [**2112**], hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral vascular disease with
positive claudication.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history is negative for
coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired dentist who has a remote tobacco
history. Last use was over 50 years ago. Social alcohol use
with 1 to 4 drinks per day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications at home include:
1. Nifedipine.
2. Lipitor.
3. Lotensin.
4. Aspirin.
5. Toprol.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No angina. Positive gastroesophageal
reflux type epigastric pain. Positive orthopnea, positive
dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath. No diabetes, no
CVA, no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. No
melena. Productive cough with yellow to brown sputum x 2
weeks.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is in no acute distress lying flat
in bed.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm S1 and S2 with a
holosystolic murmur at the base.
LUNGS: Bilateral wheezes.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused with no edema and no
varicosities. 2+ pulses throughout.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell 7.3, hematocrit 35,
platelet count 146, PT 12.5 with an INR of 1.0. Sodium 138,
potassium 3.7, chloride 106, CO2 23, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0,
glucose 158, ALT 12, AST 14, alkaline phosphatase 60, amylase
40, direct bilirubin 0.3. Carotid ultrasound from [**2117-9-1**] showed left sided stenosis with 40 to 60% LCA
stenosis and chronically occluded right internal carotid
artery. The patient was seen by the dental service and was
cleared by that service. On [**6-30**] he was brought to the
operating room. Please see the OR report for full details.

In summary, the patient had an AVL with 21 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-
[**Doctor First Name 7624**] pericardial valve as well as coronary artery bypass
graft x 2 with left internal mammary artery to the LAD and
saphenous vein graft to the patent ductus arteriosus. His
bypass time was 122 minutes with cross-clamp time of 102
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care
unit. At the time of transfer the patient was a paced at 100
beats per minute with mean arterial pressure of 60. He had
propofol at 20 mics/kg per minute as well as Levophed at 0.04
mics/kg per minute, epinephrine at 0.04 mics/ kg per minute
and milrinone at 0.25 mics/kg per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His anesthesia was reversed and he was successfully
extubated. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
day of the surgery. Over the course of the first
postoperative night, the patient was weaned from his
epinephrine drip and on postoperative day 2 he was weaned off
his milrinone as well as his Levophed infusions.
Additionally, the patient was slowly diuresed during that
period.

On postoperative day 3, the electrophysiology service was
called to interrogate the patient's permanent pacemaker. It
was noted that he was in atrial fibrillation at that time,
has an underlying rhythm below his pacemaker and amiodarone
was begun at that time following which the patient converted
back in sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day 4, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be transferred to the floor for continued
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation. Once on the
floor the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. His
activity level was increased with the assistance of the
nursing staff as well as the physical therapy staff. His
medications were adjusted to maintain an adequate blood
pressure and keep him in the normal sinus rhythm as well as
to diurese effectively.

On postoperative day 6, it was decided that the following
day, the patient would be stable and ready to be transferred
to rehabilitation, with postoperative care.  At the time of
this dictation the patient's physical examination is as
follows.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6, heart
rate 73 and in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/69,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturations 93% on room air.
NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented. Moves all extremities and
follows commands. Nonfocal examination.
PULMONARY: Bibasilar crackles, otherwise clear to
auscultation.
CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
Sternum is stable. Incision is clean and dry without erythema
or drainage.
ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender, nondistended with normal active
bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused with trace edema. Left
lower extremity incision with Steri-Strips clean and dry.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell 8.1, hematocrit 32,
platelet count 189, sodium 139, potassium 4.3, chloride 100,
CO2 30, BUN 30, creatinine 1.3, glucose 107.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient is to be discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
