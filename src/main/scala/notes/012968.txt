Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
severe COPD who was transferred from an OSH for evaluation by IP
and vascular surgery.  She has thoracoabdominal aneurysms and
tracheobronchial malacia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Retroperitoneal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm using 16
mm Dacron tube graft.

2. PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 61F w/ severe COPD who was transferred from an OSH for
evaluation by IP and vascular surgery.  She has thoracoabdominal
aneurysms and tracheobronchial malacia.

She was originally admitted to an OSH on [**1-17**] for a COPD
exacerbation, which resolved on BIPAP, steroids, and
antibiotics. During that admission, a CTA was done to rule out
PE, and this showed a 4.2 cm distal thoracic aortic aneurysm
that extends to the celiac and the origin of the celiac is
aneurysmal.  The neck
below the renals is only about 1 cm.  The AAA is about 5.8 cm,
with a distorted ovoid appearance just above the bifurcation
that is about 7.3 cm.  The aneuysm extends to the bifurcation.
There is also a R CIA aneurysm 3.6 cm.  There is also a R
adnexal mass.

The pt has had a vague abdominal pain for about a week PTA, but
this is very difficult to interpret in the setting of her
expressive aphasia.  The pain is diffuse, radiating to the back.

No nausea ior vomiting, but she is constipated (last BM
today-small).  She denies any Hx of claudication, rest pain, or
ischemic ulcers.

Past Medical History:
PMH: severe COPD (FEV1 890ml, 30% predicted on home O2), SAH/CVA
w/ subsequent sz disorder '[**73**], residualr R hemiparesis and
expressive aphasia, bipolar disorder,
.
PSH: ? C-section


Social History:
SH: She is disabled, formerly worked at daycare, quit cigarettes
over 20 yrs ago, denies EtOH or drugs


Family History:
FH: N/C, no aneurysms

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Following bronchoscopy, there is no evidence of pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum. Marked improved aeration in the right lower
lobe is present. However, there is worsening atelectasis within
the left lower lobe accompanied by an enlarging
small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Small right pleural
effusion is also demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:
1. Marked improvement in right lower lobe atelectasis following
bronchoscopy with no pneumothorax.
2. Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and increasing left
pleural effusion.

PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC; PELVIS U.S., TRANSVAGINAL

INDICATION: 61-year-old female with a history of right adnexal
mass seen on CT. Further characterization requested.

COMPARISONS: Outside hospital CT examination dated [**2190-1-24**].

FINDINGS: Transabdominal and transvaginal scanning is performed,
the latter to more closely assess the endometrium and ovaries.
The patient is post- menopausal. Per the patient the patient had
a remote possible removal of the left ovary. Transabdominal
imaging demonstrates an unremarkable appearing uterus measuring
8.3 x 3.5 x 5.0 cm. The endometrium is mildly heterogeneous and
measures 8 mm in thickness. No fibroid masses are identified.

Within the right adnexa there is a complex, multiseptated cystic
mass with several mural nodules measuring 9.2 x 3.6 x 5.8 cm
which corresponds to the previously seen right adnexal mass on
the recent CT examination. No definite vascular flow is
identified within these septae or nodules. No definable right
ovary is identified. A hyperechoic 4-cm mass just superior to
this area corresponds to a right iliac artery aneurysm seen on
the recent CT evaluation. The left ovary is not visualized.
There is no left adnexal mass.

There is no free fluid or hydronephrosis.

IMPRESSION: Complex right adnexal cystic mass containing mural
nodules. Differential diagnosis favors ovarian cystadenoma but
malignancy cannot be excluded.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS

TECHNIQUE: Low-dose MDCT axial images of the chest were
acquired. Following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray
intravenous contrast MDCT axial images were acquired from the
thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis. Coronal and sagittal
reformatted images were then obtained. Reconstructed, volume
rendered and multiplanar reformatted images were also acquired.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart is normal in size.
The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and contour with
exception of the most distal aspect (see below). There is no
significant calcification of the coronary arteries. There is no
pericardial effusion. There are no pathologically enlarged
mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes. Lung windows
demonstrate centrilobular lucencies particularly at the bases
consistent in appearance with emphysema. There are areas of
linear atelectasis present at the right lung base.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder,
adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, stomach, and abdominal
portions of the large and small bowel are unremarkable. A small
wedge-shaped hypoattenuating focus along the posterior margin of
the spleen likely represents perfusion abnormality versus a
small focus of infarction (3:70). The spleen is unremarkable in
appearance otherwise. There is no free fluid or free air within
the abdomen. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.

At the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus there is a right-sided
crescentic vertically oriented mural thrombus just superior to
the celiac artery takeoff. The aorta at this level measures 3.8
x 3.8 cm (3:65). The aorta is normal in caliber at the level of
the superior mesenteric artery takeoff. The celiac artery,
superior mesenteric artery, left renal artery and right renal
artery originate from the abdominal aorta without evidence of
narrowing or atherosclerotic disease. The normal anatomic
configuration is maintained of these vessels. There is a small
left accessory left renal artery. There is a second area of
aneurysmal dilatation below the renal arteries measuring 5.6 x
5.2 cm (3:83). Linear areas of hyperdensity along the anterior
margin of this mural thrombus likely represents [**Last Name (un) 74186**] of
calcification when examined on the coronal and sagittal
reformatted images. A third area of aneurysmal dilatation is
noted just inferior and proximal to the iliac bifurcation. This
aneurysmal dilatation contains a protuberant portion that
extends anteriorly close to the anterior abdominal wall and
measures 7.7 cm in maximal dimension. Once again, a few linear
foci of hyperdensity within the mural thrombus are probably
consistent in appearance with calcification. A patent inferior
mesenteric artery is not definitely visualized. There is
extensive mural thrombus involving the right common iliac artery
with aneurysmal dilatation measuring a maximal dimension 3.6 cm
which extends to the iliac bifuraction. Dilation of the right
superficial femoral artery to 1.2 cm is also noted.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder, rectum, sigmoid
colon, uterus and intrapelvic loops of small bowel are
unremarkable. A complex right adnexal mass was better evaluated
on the concurrent pelvic ultrasound examination. Please refer to
that exam for further details. There is no left adnexal mass.
There are no pathologic
