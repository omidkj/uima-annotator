Chief Complaint:
asthma/COPD exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year-old female with history of asthma/COPD,
mild MR, spina bifida, paraplegia, who presents from the ED with
shortness of breath.  The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Date range (1) 17379**] with a similar presentation and was diagnosed with
asthma exacerbation.  She was treated with antibiotics and
discharged on a prednisone taper.  She reports that she has felt
fatigued ever since being discharged.  Also notes subjective
fevers and cough productive of yellow sputum x 1 week.  She has
had profuse, dark-colored, watery diarrhea with small amounts of
BRB for the past 2 days (she is unable to quantify the frequency
of stool).  Her SOB came on this morning and became
progressively worse over the course of the day, despite use of
her albuterol inhaler.  She reports compliance with her
medications, including advair and her prednisone taper.  She was
able to wheel herself over to a neighbor's apartment who then
called EMS.  On arrival, EMS found her sat to be 86% on RA,
improved to 97% after an albuterol neb.
.
In addition to the above she complains of severe chest pain and
abdominal pain that are both chronic for her.  She describes the
chest pain as substernal but spreads across her left and right
chest and also down her mid-abdomen.  The abdominal pain is
located in her mid-abdomen.  Both are unchanged.  On her last
admission, she was ruled out for MI and discharged on standing
ibuprofen.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.1, BP 146/84, HR 108, RR 22,
satting 97% on 4L NC.  She appeared anxious, was speaking in
short sentences, and lung exam was notable for diffuse wheezes
and tight sounding airways.  She had a leukocytosis with WBC
14.2.  EKG without ischemic changes.  She was put on continuous
nebs with some improvement in her breathing.  She also received
magnesium, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  The patient still
reported subjective SOB and was given ativan with good effect.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring and further
management.

CXR:  AP portable upright chest radiograph is obtained. Hilar
prominence is unchanged which may be compatible with mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no overt CHF or evidence
of pneumonia. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax or large
pleural effusion is present. Osseous structures appear intact.

EKG: NSR at 91, LAD, no ST or TW changes, no significant change
from prior


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory Distress:  The patient's respiratory distress was
attributed to an acute asthma/COPD exacerbation with a component
of anxiety.  Pulmonary history is not entirely clear, as there
are no PFTS in out system.  It is unclear whether she fully
recovered from her recent asthma exacerbation and also whether
she was truly compliant with her medications at home.
Respiratory status improved greatly in the ED after receiving
magnesium, azithromycin, and solumedrol with almost complete
resolution of SOB and no further supplemental oxygen
requirements.  Overnight in the ICU she was managed with
albuterol nebs every 2 hrs.  She was also maintained on advair
[**Hospital1 **] and continued on her prednisone taper.  On transfer from the
ICU, the patient was stable, saturating 100% on room air.  On
arrival to the floor, I asked her if she smoked crack cocaine
and she stated that she had prior to this sob episode prompting
admission.  She remained stable respiratory-wise.  Social work
was consulted and the plan of arranging placment and or
maximization of home services was initiated in conjuction with
case managment.

#  Chest pain:  On admission the patient complained of severe
ongoing chest pain likely secondary to previously diagnosed
costochondroitis.  The pain was reproducible on palpation, there
were no ischemic changes on EKG.  Pain was managed with
ibuprofen PRN

#  Abdominal pain:  This is chronic and unchanged.  Felt to be
secondary to [**Hospital1 80011**] tube.  Given the patient's complaint of
frequent diarrhea c diff assay sent and was negative.

# Hx of seizures: Patient has a questionable history of
seizures/ pseudoseizures.  As on her previous admission,
dilantin level was subtherapeutic upon this hospitalization.  As
patient complaince is unknown, she was continued on her prior
dose of dilantin with the plan to titrate dose over current
hospital stay.  Her neurologic status was stable and she
exhibited no seizure activity.

#  Psych: Carries diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed
Emotional Features & Personality Disorder NOS. Pt. denied any
suicidality.

#Social: Patient has had multiple repeat hospitalizations.  It
is unclear whether she is capable of caring for her multiple
medical issues by herself.  Social work was consulted to see if
the patient was ameniable to entering a longterm facility with a
higher level of care and or whether additional services for home
could be arranged, but she did not meet criteria for higher
level of care. She was discharged home with nursing, physical
therapy, social work, and home health aide services.
