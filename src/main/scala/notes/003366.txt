Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20224**]
Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with history of tracheostomy for respiratory failure
in [**9-16**], recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
fibrillation, PEs, anticoagulation stopped [**2164-12-24**], and
endocarditis presents after being found down.  The patient was
found in his apartment on the floor.  The patient was found to
be intoxicated, but no complaints on arrival to the ED.

In the ED, his initial vital signs were HR 100 BP 140/100 RR 24
O2 100% on an unclear amount of O2.  The patient was initially
combative and agitated.  He received haldol and lorazepam.  He
became somnolent after these medications and was placed on a
non-rebreather.  A chest x-ray showed no significant infiltrate.
 A CTA was performed which showed no evidence pulmonary
embolism, however possible RML infiltrate, RLL and LLL
atelectasis.  He had a head and neck CT which did not show
significant change from previous.  His labs were significant for
hyperkalemia, but was moderately hemolyzed.  A repeat K was 5.6,
with no EKG changes.  His tox screen was significant for ETOH
level of 488.  He received a total of 2 L of NS.  He then had an
episode of RVR which was treated with 15mg, then 25mg of IV
diltiazem.  His rate was not well controlled, so he was started
on a diltiazem drip.  He also received ceftriaxone 1gm,
levofloxacin 500mg, and valium 10mg IV prior to transfer.  On
transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his vital signs were HR 120 BP 136/82 O2
100% on NRB RR 25.

Unable to obtain review of systems secondary to somnolence.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture,
atrial fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis
admitted for alcohol [**Month/Day (2) **], atrial fib with RVR and
respiratory distress.

1.  Respiratory Distress: Given the patient was afebrile, felt
was likely aspiration pneumonitis, and patient was started on
Levofloxacin/Flagyl on [**1-8**] for aspiration pneumonia.  The
Flagyl was stopped on [**1-10**]. He completed a 5 day course of
levofloxacin for pneumonia empirically and improved.

2.  Atrial Fibrillation: Most likely was in rapid ventricular
response secondary to increased catecholamine surge from
[**Month/Day (4) **]. He was treated with diltiazem drip initially.  As
[**Month/Day (4) **] improved HR was controlled with resumption of his home
medications.

3.  ETOH intoxication/Polysubstance abuse:  Patient was
maintained on CIWA during admission, and given MVI/thiamine.
His [**Month/Day (4) **] was complicated by hallucinations. He requested to
leave [**1-11**] but was thought too intoxicated, likely due to benzos
used to treat his [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] psychiatry was consulted and
agreed he was not competent to leave. He was improved on [**1-12**]
and again wanting to leave. He was again evaluated by psychiatry
and felt able to be discharged safely. He was also evaluated by
physical therapy and cleared to be discharged safely from their
perspective. Social work was consulted to assist with
transportation.

4.  Hepatitis:  He was noted to have a transaminitis on
admission thought secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in
addition to Hep C.  He had relatively preserved synthetic
function and lft's improved to normal during his course..

5.  Depression:  He was continued citalopram.  Quetiapine was
held out of concern for worsening sedation with this medication.
