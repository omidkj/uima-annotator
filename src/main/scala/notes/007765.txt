History of Present Illness:
46 yo male unrestrained driver s/p multiple rollover motor
vehicle crash; was reportedly awake at the scene. He was taken
to an area hospital where he was found to be hypotensive and was
intubated on arrival. he was then transferred via [**Location (un) 7622**] to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care. A chest tube was placed, his blood
pressure varied between 80 and 115 systolic and was dependent
upon transfusion of blood and blood products. FAST examination
which suggested a hematoma in the right kidney. The CXR and
Pelvic AP films showed no bleeding site. He was taken to the
operating room for exploration of his abdomen.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2195-4-7**] 9:23 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval ICH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
47M rollover mvc
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 47-year-old with rollover motor vehicle collision.
Evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: No intra- or extra-axial bleed, masses, mass effect,
or shift of normally midline structures is noted. The ventricles
and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and
white matter differentiation is well preserved. No acute major
vascular territorial infarcts are evident.

No acute fractures. Mild mucosal thickening in left maxillary
sinus and moderate opacification of bilateral anterior and
posterior ethmoid air cells, likely secondary to patient's
intubation is noted. The mastoid air cells are well pneumatized.
The remainder of the soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process or hemorrhage.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2195-4-7**] 9:23 AM
FINDINGS: A focus of ovoid hyperdense material is noted in the
posterior nasopharynx. This could represent a foriegn body,
possibly post-intubation chipped dental enamel. There are no
acute fractures or alignment abnormalities of the cervical
spine. The atlanto- occipital atlanto- axial articulations are
preserved. The facet joints well aligned. The paravertebral soft
tissues are unremarkable. Endotracheal tube is present in
standard location with balloon inflated 1.6 mm below the vocal
cord. Right posterior first and second rib and left posterior
first rib fractures are evident. There is soft tissue emphysema
coursing along the left posterior intramuscular planes. Apical
chest tube with a left apical pneumothorax is also noted. There
is opacification of bilateral ethmoid air cells, likely due to
intubation. Multiple prominent lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm
in short axis not enlarged by CT criteria.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fractures or alignment abnormalities of the cervical
spine.
2. Right first rib and bilateral second rib fractures.
3. Left apical pneumothorax and soft tissue emphysema.
4. Layering hyperdense material in the posterior nasopharyngeal
wall of uncertain etiology, may represent chipped dental enamel,
post intubation, clinical correlation is recommended.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

ELBOW, AP & LAT VIEWS LEFT PORT  [**2195-4-7**] 4:30 PM
FINDINGS: Subluxation at the left elbow is noted. The olecranon
is posteriorly subluxed with respect to the humerus, and the
trochlea appears to be perched on the coronoid process of the
proximal ulna. Widening of the radiocapitellar joint is noted
along the radial aspect of the elbow joint. No definite
underlying fracture is seen. Diffuse soft tissue swelling is
noted.

IMPRESSION:

Subluxation at the left elbow joint including subluxation of the
olecranon with respect to the distal humerus.

Done [**2195-4-20**] at 2:17:45 PM      FINAL

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
1. A patent foramen ovale is present.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic wall is thickened consistent with an intramural
hematoma.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 7. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Post-stent deployment.

1. There is a enhancement at the junction of the aortic arch and
descendiong thoracic aortic consistent with a stent.





Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Vascular and Orthopedics
Surgery were also consulted because of his injuries. His
vascular injury - aortic tear with
associated para-aortic hematoma at thoracic T4-5 level was not
repaired initially as he was deemed stable and required repair
of his other multiple injuries more urgently. He was taken to
the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and placement of
his left chest tube by Trauma Surgery. Orthopedics also
performed irrigation and debridement of the open left elbow
wound and closed reduction of the fracture same site. There were
no intraoperative complications; postoperatively he was taken to
the Trauma ICU. Two days later he was taken back to the
operating room for placement of IVC filter and insertion of
superior left chest tube; also underwent by Orthopedic surgery
sacroiliac screw fixation of left hemipelvis and examination
under anesthesia left elbow with irrigation and debridement left
elbow laceration down to fascia. A left elbow external fixator
remains in place; he will follow up in [**Hospital 5
