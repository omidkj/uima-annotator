Date of Birth:   [**2064-5-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 67 year old
female with a long medical history including atrial
fibrillation without Coumadin (the patient declined),
supraventricular tachycardia post ablation times two,
multiple sclerosis, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], migraines, and
prescription medication abuse who presented to the Emergency
Room on [**2131-6-8**] complaining of episodic speech arrest
for two days and nausea, diarrhea and headache for one day.
The patient was in her usual state of health until [**2131-6-6**], when she experienced several episodes of speech arrest
while in the car with her husband.  The next day, she awoke
with severe headache and nausea with diarrhea and vomiting
times four in addition to her episodic speech arrest.

Her primary care physician saw her and drew blood which
revealed a potassium of 2.9.   MRI showed periventricular
white matter changes by the inferior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right
lateral ventricle as well as left mastoiditis. Her symptoms
continued the next day with headache and vomiting times two
as well as speech arrest.  The patient went to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Room, her vital signs were temperature 97.0
F.; blood pressure 155/74; pulse 72; respiratory rate 16;
oxygen saturation 94%.  She was alert and oriented times
three.  Her examination was nonfocal except for asymmetric
patellar reflexes and difficulty word finding.  The patient
was given p.o. potassium and started on Clarithromycin.
While receiving an EEG from Neurology, the patient had a
tonic-clonic seizure.  She received one gram total of
Dilantin over a one hour time period.

On hour following her seizure, she received 30 mg of
Diltiazem, 10 mg of Lisinopril and 28 mg Nadolol.  An hour
after receiving all three of those medications, her systolic
blood pressure dropped to the 80s, her heart rate dropped to
the 50s and she had decreasing mental status.  She received
28 mg of calcium gluconate intravenous, Atropine 3 mg
intravenously and 500 cc. of normal saline.  Her EKG at the
time showed a narrow junctional rhythm at 54 beats per
minute, T wave inversions in leads III and AVf.  The patient
received more calcium as well as Glucagon and was intubated
for airway protection.  Pacing pads were placed.

Labs in the Emergency Room showed a normal CBC, normal PT and
PTT, normal urinalysis, normal liver function tests, normal
CK and troponin.

Labs were notable for a potassium of 2.9.  Her toxicology
screen was negative.  A lumbar puncture showed no cells in
the cerebrospinal fluid.

CT scan of the head done on [**6-9**] showed mucosal thickening
in her bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.  Chest x-ray
showed minimal bilateral atelectasis.  MRA was normal.  MRI
of the head showed mild changes due to small vessel disease.

MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on Dopamine,
Propofol and Glucagon intravenously.  Her initial EKG showed
sinus rhythm at 77 beats per minute, normal axis, normal
intervals.  Shortly after her admission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was extubated.  MRI was
repeated and showed no focal abnormalities.  MRA showed no
abnormalities.

On her first day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit she
experienced multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response followed by five second pauses.
Her blood pressure decreased and was restored with 1 mg of
Atropine.

A Cardiology consultation came and placed a pacing wire.

Pulmonary artery catheterization revealed no association
between her heart rate, blood pressure and MVO2, therefore,
there was suspicion for autonomic dysfunction.  Dopamine was
weaned off.  She was seen by Electrophysiology who determined
that she had sick sinus syndrome and implanted a pacemaker on
[**2131-6-11**].

An echocardiogram was also done on [**6-11**].  This showed a
mildly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular
thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than
55% and one plus mitral regurgitation.

Despite treatment of her bradycardia, episodes of hypotension
continued times two, requiring IVF of 250 cc. plus Midodrine
10 mg times one.  She was seen by the Congestive heart
failure Service who recommended Diltiazem for her blood
pressure control.

The patient had one episode of shortness of breath on [**2131-6-13**] in the morning which was resolved with Lasix.

Her mental status improved to the point where she was
conversational on [**2131-6-13**], however, she became confused
and began speaking nonsensically that evening.  On the
morning of admission to CC7, the patient underwent a CT scan
of the head.  CT scan was consistent with the prior
examination.

Results from her most recent EEG revealed no seizures but an
irregular rhythm was noted on the cardiac monitor.  Coumadin
and aspirin were begun for prophylaxis against atrial
fibrillation related stroke.  Her Team determined that she
was stable for transfer to CC7.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 97.3 F.; blood pressure
148/72; pulse 80; respiratory rate 18; O2 saturation 97% on
room air.  In general, in no acute distress, resting
comfortably, alert and oriented times three (with effort).
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Neck supple, no jugular venous
distention, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales or
rhonchi.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, plus bowel
sounds.  Extremities warm and well perfused.  No cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Two plus pulses.  Neurological:  The
patient is oriented times three but confused, attempting to
place her pencil in her coffee and asking for a number
repeatedly perseverating on seeing her rabbi.  Twitching left
leg noted during examination.

LABORATORY:  Normal CBC.  Chem-7 notable for potassium of
3.2, normal PT, PTT and INR.  Normal protein and albumin.
Chest x-ray showed improved prominence of the vasculature
suggesting improvement of her congestive heart failure.
Bilaterally pleural effusions and atelectasis were noted.  No
pneumothorax, no consolidation.

EKG on [**6-11**] showed a sinus and paced rhythm.  Rate 67.  PR
zero, QRS 94, QT/QTC 416/431.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 139**] on
Telemetry.  She was continued on Dilantin for seizure
prevention and no further seizures were noted throughout the
course of her stay.

The cause of the patient's confusion and changing mental
status was thought to be possible post-ictal state versus a
toxic metabolic syndrome.

The cause of the patient's hypotension was never completely
elucidated, however, it was thought to be related to
autonomic dysfunction.  In light of the fact that the patient
had been on steroids several years prior to admission, a
morning cortisol test was done.  The result was 10.2.

The patient experienced no further episodes of bradycardia,
and no more episodes of hypotension after being transferred
to CC7.  The patient's main active issue while on CC7 was her
mental status.

On her first day on CC7, the patient was confused with speech
arrest.  This was similar to her initial presentation to the
Emergency Room.  On the following day, however, the patient
was no longer confused but rather was experiencing paranoid
delusions regarding her Telemetry wires being a recording
device and her home being robbed and her husband's phone
lines being tapped.  The patient was very afraid of these
delusions.

Psychiatry was consulted regarding the patient's change in
mental status and felt that the delusions were likely a
result of resolving delirium.  However, it was discovered
that the patient may have a history of bipolar disorder and
was treated with Zyprexa in the past.  It was also discovered
that the patient has attempted to commit suicide at least
three times
