Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal
LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Moderate global
RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Mildly dilated descending
aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Thickened MVR leaflets.. Increased MVR gradient.
Severe valvular MS (MVA <1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring. Moderate to
severe [3+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:

     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened and have markedly
limited opening.. The gradients are higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis. There is severe valvular mitral
stenosis (area 0.6-0.7cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is
present. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen.

POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function remains normal. RV systolic function
remains moderately impaired. There is a well seated, well
functioning, bileaflet mechanical prosthesis in the mitral
position. Valvular MR is present which is normal in quantity and
location for this type of prosthesis. A anulloplasty ring is
visualized in the tricuspid position. TR is now trace. The
remaining study is unchanged from the prebypass study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
