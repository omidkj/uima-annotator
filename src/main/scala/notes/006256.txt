History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman presents after acute onset of inability to speak at
~6:00 pm today.  History is obtained from daughter who was with
her at onset.  She was eating dinner and was last seen well at
~5:50 pm.  Her daughter went into the other room and upon
returning found her mother unable to speak and with a ? right
facial assymetry.  She called EMS who arrived soon after and
took a blood glucose at 143.  She arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] at 6:17 pm.
Code Stroke was called at 6:18 pm and I arrived at 6:20 pm, with
Neurology Resident already at the bedside.  NIHSS was ~22 (2 for
not alert, 2 incorrect month/age, 2 incorrect commands, 2 forced
deviation to the left, 2 complete hemianopia, 2 partial facial
paralysis, 4 no movement right arm, 2 right leg some effort
against gravity, 3 mute, 1 inattention).  Labs were drawn and
she was taken to CT scan at 6:28 pm, CT sone at 6:30 pm and read
at 6:31 pm with no bleed, no sign of early infarct and ? slight
left dense MCA sign.

She returned to ER and floey was placed, 2nd IV was placed and
t- PA was mixed.  After lengthy discussion with daughter about
risks and benefits (including bleeding risk) she agreed to treat
with t-PA. tPA bolus given at 6:55 pm.

[**5-12**] CT head Chronic infarct in left parietal region and
moderate changes of small vessel disease. No acute hemorrhage or
mass effect. MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**] weighted images may help to
exclude acute infarct,if clinically indicated.

[**5-12**] CTA head-
1)  Large left middle cerebral artery territory infarct, with
occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from just above
the carotid bifurcation to and throughout the left middle
cerebral artery.
2)  No evidence of dissection, aneurysm, or occlusion within the
right carotid artery, right and left vertebral arteries, and the
remainder of the vessels of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**].

[**5-15**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(estimated ejection fraction ?35-40%). No apical thrombus is
seen (however the apical aneurysm is a potential cause of
thromboembolism). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] Year old woman presents with global aphasia, left eye
deviation and right hemiparesis and NIHSS ~22 treated with tPA.

Neuro-She was admitted to the Neuro SICU with standard post tPA
orders. Repeat CT scan on [**5-13**] showed evolving left MCA infarct,
small vessel disease and chronic left parietoccipital infarct.
CTA revealed a distal left ICA thrombus that extended in the M1
segment of the left MCA. Her exam did not improve after tPA and
she remained unresponsive with with flacid right hemiparesis.
Initial plan was for Aggrenox but this was held since the
daughter did not want an [**Name (NI) 104370**] placed and preferred PEG
placement. Per daughter the patient had been on coumadin in the
past and repeat TTE revealed an apical aneurysm with telemetry
no revealing any atrial fibrillation. Coumadin was initially
held for placement of PEG on [**5-15**] but plan was made for NO
anticoagulation due to the patient's poor prognosis and risk of
bleeding. She was restarted on ASA on [**5-16**]. Tube feedings were
initiate per nutrition recs. Given poor prognosis for functional
recovery, episodes of apnea, and hypoperfusion of extremities,
her daughter decided to transfer the patient to hospice for
comfort care.

Hypothyroidism-While NPO she was converted to 40mcg of IV
levothyroxine but converted back to PO 88mcg after PEG-J tube
placement.

HTN-All antihypertensives were initially held due to stable
SBP's in the 110-150 range. Outpatient lisinopril 5mg was
restarted on [**5-16**] and lasix was held until the patient was
established on an appropriate tube feeding regimen.

Px-She was maintained on PPI and SC heparin was started after
PEG placement
