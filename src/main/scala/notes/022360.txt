Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
71 yo male with metastatic esophageal carcinoma currently being
docetaxil and bevacizumab. He underwent a BAL on [**1-11**] which
showed strep pneumo. He was then recently admitted on [**1-13**]-
[**1-14**] with dehydration and pneumonia, was treated, and
discharged with an appointment for a video swallowing study on
[**1-19**] to evaluate for aspiration. He underwent this study today
and per patient this went well. He then went back to his house,
sat on the stairs because he felt weak, and then lost
consciousness and slumped to the side witnessed by his son and
wife. There was no head trauma or falls. He was also reported to
have cyanotic lips and fingers and chills. His wife called EMS
to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **]. On arrival he had a temp of 100.8, HR in the
140 - 160s, BP 70 - 90 systolic. He had an elevated white count
and a lactate of 8.9. Sepsis protocol was instutited, RIJ was
placed, and he was given vanco, ceftriaxone, azithromycin,
cefepime, potassium repletion, and 2.5 liters of fluid. Since
his BP was labile, he was placed on Levophed. His Hb decreased
from 12 to 8 after fluids and he was transfused 1 unti of PRBC
in the ED.

During the past few weeks, the patient reports that he has not
been eating due to lack of appetite. He denies N/V/D. He has not
had a BM in 4 days. He has been drinking lots of water he
reports. + rhinorrhea.

Past Medical History:
1. metastatic adenocarcinoma of the GE junction T3/N1, s/p chemo
(irinotecan and cisplatin-->carboplatin [**2-23**] tox). chemo d/c'd 22
disease progression [**10-25**]
2. emphysema/COPD

Social History:
quit tobacco 4 years ago, previously smoked one pack per day for
30 years, occasional EtOH, no drugs, lives at home with his wife
and is a retired air conditioning business owner. Normally able
to walk up stairs, however in the last few days, he has been
requiring assistance walking around.

Family History:
no CAD, cancer, or pulmonary disease

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for Right IJ line placement, PTX

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old man with s/p endoscopy with syncope
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for Right IJ line placement, PTX
INDICATION: Evaluate right IJ placement, rule out pneumothorax.

AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison to AP upright chest of two
hours [**Known lastname **]. There has been interval placement of right-sided IJ
line, with its tip in the inferior SVC. No pneumothorax.
PortaCath tip unchanged in position. There has been no other
significant interval change.

IMPRESSION: Right-sided IJ with its tip in the SVC; no
pneumothorax. No other significant interval change

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1) Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions and
free fluid
within the abdomen and pelvis without abscess identified.

2) No significant interval change in previously described patchy
pulmonary
opacities.

3) Unchanged liver lesions and celica axis and mesenteric lymph
nodes.

4) No new lesions identified.

4) Interval development of nonspecific colon wall thickening,
which is not
well distended. Clinical correlation is recommended as this
could represent
an infectious colitis. Ischemic colitis is considered less
likely given
distribution.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo male, h/o metastatic adenocarcinoma of the GE
junction, s/p irinotecan/carboplatin, now on experimental
chemotherapeutic regimen, admitted with hypotension (?sepsis),
currently stable, being treated for ?pneumonia and poor PO
intake.
.
1.  Hypotension: Initially, sepsis by protocol was instituted in
the setting of increased lactate, hypotension, hyperthermia,
tachycardia, and an elevated white count. However, most likley
not an infectious process, but rather dehydration from paucity
of PO intake. The patient was hypotensive in the ED which
respondeed to fluid boluses. Other causes: pneumonia, sinusitis,
line infection, or autonomic dysfxn [**2-23**] cisplain therapy. The
patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was treated witht he sepsis
protocol. His lactate continue to be low, his pressure increased
with fluid boluses and his Levophed was weaned to off. GIven his
nasal conjestion, cough, and weakness, he was placed on
precautions and evaluated for influenza which was negative.
Screening for adrenal insuffiency was negative. Blood and urine
cultures were also taken which were also negative. Vancomycin,
azithromycin, and cefepime was stopped and the Levofloxacin was
contined for strep pneumo coverage that had previously been
documented via bronch.  He completed his Levaquin on [**2174-1-26**]. Pt
subsequently transferred to regular medical service from ICU.
On the floor the pt continued to be baseline hypotensive to the
80s systolic.  Review of the pt's OMR chart shows that this was
his baseline bp [**Known lastname **] to any chemotx.
.
On the floor, he continued to be stable hemodynamically.  The
levofloxacin was continued until [**2174-1-24**] for empiric pneumonia
coverage (and given history of strep pneumo on bronch recently).
  He was continued on IVF for poor PO intake (was
hemodynamically/had adequate SBP's).  CT of the
chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for any obvious source of
infection, and he remained afebrile with a normal WBC.
.
2.  Syncope/orthostasis: there was a question of whether he
syncopized on day of admission.  He was persistently hypotensive
(SBP's 80-100) while in-house, although this appears to be close
to his baseline when old OMR notes were referenced.  He was
maintained on telemetry with no significant events. Pt also had
TTE showing mild diastolic dysfunction but o/w no signficant
structural heart disease to account for syncope. Later in
hospital course, pt was found profoundly orthostatic with
systolic pressure going from 100 to 50 w/ supine to standing.
Although syncope was not induced, pt was quite symptomatic w/
these changes. The etiology of this orthostasis remains unclear.
As mentioned below, pt has had difficulties w/ adequate po
intake secondary to anorexia - however, he was not felt to be
profoundly dehydrated. It was theorized that there may be
component of autononic dysfunction (for unclear reasons) causing
orthostasis and tilt test was performed.  Preliminary results
from the tilt were equivocal and after discussions w/ oncology,
it was decided to start patient on florinef 0.1 mg po bid, with
some objec
