CT Head:
1.  No acute intracranial injury.
2.  No skull fracture.
3.  Moderate atrophy with chronic caudate nuclei lacunes,
bilaterally.

CT Cspine:
1.  No evidence of fracture.
2.  Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine with
the most
profound area of abnormality at C5-C6, where there is moderate
canal and
moderate foraminal stenosis.
3.  Severe panacinar emphysema in the lung apices.
4.  Smooth intralobular septal thickening which raises the
question of volume overload.  Please correlate with clinical
exam.
5.  1.3 cm hypodense right thyroid nodule for which ultrasound
followup is
recommended if not already performed.

T/L spine:
Superior endplate collapse at L3 of indeterminate age.  No
specific findings to suggest acute fracture, however correlation
with site of pain recommended.

[**2115-10-9**] Echocardiogram: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Increased LVEDP. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
The constellation of findings of right ventricular enlargement
and pulmonary artery hypertension is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism) ?acute on chronic.


[**2115-10-10**] CT Chest without contrast: 1.  Impaction of right lower
lobe bronchi with partial right lower lobe collapse.  Associated
soft tissue density surrounding central bronchovascular
structures raises concern for possible neoplastic mass, although
inflammatory process surrounding the bronchi is also possible.
Consider bronchoscopy for initial further evaluation.
Alternatively, if warranted clinically, contrast enhanced CT
could be performed to better characterize this region.
2.  Incompletely imaged abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring
approximately 4 cm with possible chronic dissection.  Recommend
dedicated CTA examination of the abdominal aorta for more
complete assessment.
3.  Severe emphysema.
4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2115-10-15**] CT Chest with contrast: 1. Impaction of right lower lobe
bronchi with mild improvement in the degree of right lower lobe
aeration.  Previously described soft tissue density surrounding
the right lower lobe bronchovascular structures is unchanged and
concern for possible neoplastic mass is not further evaluated
without contrast.
2.  Severe emphysema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  Incompletely imaged abdominal aortic aneurysm with possible
chronic
dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 y.o. female with PMHx of COPD, CHF, atrial fibrillation,
macular degeneration, hyperlipidemia, and DM admitted for
syncope work-up s/p fall, transferred to ICU for management of
hypoxia likely due to RLL collapse from mucous plugging versus
PNA verus mass in patient with severe [**Hospital 2182**] transferred to ICU
for hypoxia.

#  Shortness of breath secondary to RLL collapse in patient with
severe COPD and splinting due to chest wall hematoma.  Also with
fevers and bandemia initially which resolved.  CT on [**10-10**] showed
RLL collapse secondary to possible mucous plug vs neoplastic
mass.  Initially held off on bronchoscopy given high oxygen
requirement.  She improved clinically and was on 2L nasal canula
prior to discharge breathing comfortably.  She was continued on
nebulizer treatments and treated with levofloxacin for 7 day
course (completed on [**10-15**]).  She underwent repeat CT chest with
contrast which showed similar right lower lobe lung finding
(results above) again raising question of inflammatory process
vs neoplasm.  Discussed this finding with patient's daughter.
Further work-up including bronchoscopy and washings was
discussed and also discussed possibility of lung mass and
further work-up with this.  The daughter would like to consider
whether they would want further work-up.  She has an outpatient
Pulmonologist who will be notified of this finding prior to
patient discharge.  Theophylline was discontinued in light of
possible episode of syncope (though Theophylline was measured to
be slightly sub-therapeutic at 8.3).  Continued singulair and
fluticasone.  Incentive spirometer at bedside to reduce poor
inspiration from splinting.  Continued pain control for chest
contusion to avoid splinting with Lidocaine patch and ATC
acetaminophen with PRN oxycodone

# SYNCOPE:   Etiology of syncope remains unclear, although
sounds cardiac (? arrhythmia) in origin.  Cardiac enzymes were
negative and echo did not reveal a source of syncope: no aortic
stenosis although [**1-22**]+ AR/TR/MR.  Carotid ultrasounds were
performed, and no significant stenoses bilaterally. Monitored on
telemetry without arrythmias.

# RENAL FAILURE: Patient's creatine was 1.6 on admission.  FeNa
of 0.8% upon admission suggested prerenal etiology.  Her BUN
creatinine trended down to baseline; Based on records from
[**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 74467**] Hospital, patient's baseline creatinine appears
to be around 1.3.  Maintained adequate urine output.

# Pain.  Patient has chest wall hematoma due to syncopal event.
This is likely contributing to SOB.  Continued around the clock
tylenol, PRN vicadin, and lidocaine patch which seemed to be
controlling her pain.

# AAA: Patient incidentally noted to have a 4 cm AAA with
possible chronic dissection on her chest CT.  She did not have
signs/symptoms of acute issue during this hospitalization.
Based on her DNR/DNI status it was felt that not sure that
patient/family would want this invasive type of surgery.

# HTN: Normotensive. Metoprolol started in hospital (switched
from home Atenolol at home for HTN/rate controL).  Held
lisinopril in setting of ARF and controlled blood pressure.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Supratherapeutic on Coumadin on
presentation.  Currently rate-controlled on Digoxin.  Continued
Digoxin.  INR trended down, coumadin restarted.

# ARTHRITIS/GOUT:  Held Allopurinol and colchicine given
elevated creatinine, consider restarting as outpatient.  No
acute gout flare during hospi
