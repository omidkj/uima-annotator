Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
EtOH withdrawal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement
Arterial line placement
Intubation
tPA treatment for pulmonary embolus

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old male with a history of polysubstance abuse
(ETOH, heroine, crack and cocaine) and hepatitis C who presents
for alcohol detoxification. Pt reports that he had been drinking
~2 pints of whiskey per day for the past 18 mo and that two days
ago he decided to "sober up" and hasn't had a drink since.
Yesterday morning started to feel "the shakes" and while walking
down the street his R leg suddenly started to shake
uncontrolably and he fell down. He does not recall the episode
very well but does recall that he never had LOC and denies loss
of bowel or bladder control during the episode. He has gone
through withdrawal in the past but denies ever having seizures
or DT's. Denies CP, palpitations, SOB, HA, diarrhea or abdominal
pain.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 97.9 P88 BP150/100 R16 O2
sat 95%. In the ED he was noted to be intermittently agitated
and tremoulous. He was given 40mg valium. He was also noted to
be intermittently in atrial fibrillation with RVR to 170s and
was given diltiazem 20 mg IV x 1 then diltiazem 40 mg PO. He was
also given folate, thiamine, MVI and 2L NS. He had a head CT
that was negative for an acute process.
.
In the ICU he noted feeling shaky and requested that he be
detoxed during this hospitalization.


Past Medical History:
Polysubstance abuse (heroin, cocaine, ETOH). Detoxed following
admission to an inpatient facility about 3 years ago. Currently
in [**Hospital1 **] suboxone program.
Hepatitis C
Depression

hypertension. Mother died of lung cancer in mid 70s. Three
siblings; two brothers, one sister, all in good health.

.
CTA chest ([**9-17**])
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, extending to all lobar
arteries.
2. Peripheral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] and ground-glass opacities, suggesting
possible
infection.
3. IVC reflux, hepatic vein reflux-findings indicate an element
of right heart failure.
.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound ([**9-17**]): Bilateral
non-occlusive thrombus within the peroneal vein extending into
the distal popliteal veins.
.
Echocardiography TTE ([**9-17**])
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-6**],
left ventricular systolic function is improved and the right
ventricular cavity is now dilated and severely hypokinetic (c/w
pulmonary embolism). Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now present.

Echocardiography TTE ([**9-24**])
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is a
small pericardial effusion. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade
may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-17**], a
small pericardial effusion is now seen. This is located anterior
to the right ventricle. There is respiratory variation in the
mitral inflow, suggesting impaired LV filling. However, this
could be due to the dilated, hypokinetic RV. There is no
evidence of RA or RV collapse, however echo signs of tamponade
may be absent when the RA and RV pressures are elevated.
.
ECHO TTE [**2164-9-28**]: Compared with the findings of the [**2164-9-24**], the right ventricle is no longer dilated, and contractile
function is markedly improved. The pericardial effusion is
smaller.
.
MRI [**2164-10-3**]: 1. No finding to specifically suggest vertebral
osteomyelitis, discitis, or paraspinal or epidural abscess.
2. Thoracolumbar scoliosis with asymmetric degenerative changes,
as described above. These findings are most marked at the L3-4
and L4-L5 levels, where there is subarticular zone stenosis,
bilaterally, without definite neural impingement.
3. Diffusely and relatively uniformly hypointense signal in
vertebral bone
marrow, without focal abnormality (other than discogenic
endplate changes). This appearance may reflect red marrow
re-conversion in response to underlying anemia, or even diffuse
osteopenia, but an infiltrative process cannot be completely
excluded - clinical correlation recommended.
