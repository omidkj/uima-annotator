CXR: [**1-12**] - Satisfactory positioning of this central venous
catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 47yo HTN, CRI, sarcoidosis, & poorly controlled DM w/ mult
admissions for DKA who p/w DKA, then hospital course complicated
by fevers thought to be secondary to pneumonia.
.
.
# DKA: In the MICU, he initially had: AG 29, CXR clear, no
intraabdominal complains, afebrile w/ no leukocytosis, EKG show
TWI and troponin of 0.36, but in [**2143-11-28**] clean cath, CK
remained flat and troponin stable.  Underlying cause of DKA
thought to be medication non-compliance. No obvious other cause
of DKA--pt does not appear to be infected, no clear ischemic
event (trop elevation [**3-14**] leak in setting of CRI). Patient was
given aggressive hydration and started on insulin gtt in the
ICU.  electrolytes checked q2hours initially.  His anion gap
closed and he was able to be transitioned to SC insulin.  [**Last Name (un) **]
was consulted and assisted in control of sugars during
hospitalization.  He was discharged on a simple and effective
regimen of 30U of 75/25 [**Hospital1 **].  He has outpatient follow up with
[**Last Name (un) **].
.
# Trop elevation: Likely leak in setting of CRI. EKG unchange
(non-specific TWI in inferior & lateral precordial leads). Pt
had clean cath [**2143-11-25**]. Trop trending down. Continued on
aspirin, lipitor, Beta-blocker.
.
# HTN: He was continued on all of his home medications
(nifedipine, furosemide, and labetalol) with an increase in
dosage of his labetolol from 400mg TID to 600mg TID.
.
# ARF on CKD: Admission Cr of 3.5, with baseline of [**4-12**].2, was
likely pre-renal in setting of DKA and improved w/ hydration.
CKD is thought to be due to HTN & diabetic nephropathy.  Protein
to Cr ratio of 6.0.  Improved to 2.8-3.1 during hospitalization.

.
# Anemia: Baseline hct 27-29, during his hospitalization he was
between 24-27. No obvious sources of bleeding. Likely [**3-14**] renal
insufficiency.  We continued epogen.  Iron studies from [**Month (only) **]
[**2143**] show a mix of iron deficiency anemia (low fe, low fe/tibc
ratio)and anemia of chronic disease (ferritin > 100).  Could
consider outpatient iron supplementation to help with epogen.
.
# Cardiomyopathy: EF 40-45%, likely related to
hypertension/alcohol. No active issues during hospitalization.
.
# acute angle glaucoma: Patient was seen by opthamology.  We
continued all eyedrops per their recommendations.  He will need
outpatient follow up.
.
# Barrett's esophagus: We continued his protonix.
.
# RUE swelling: RUE slightly swollen and uncomfortable at sight
of Right SVC line.  Ultrasound was negative for clot. See below.

.
# Pneumonia: Patient had fevers and leukocytosis with right
lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray, oxygen sats around 95% and
right flank pain.  The fever and leukocytosis was initially
attributed to ?line infection while central line was in (red
tender at site) and treated temporarily with vancomycin, but the
blood cultures were all negative.  He had negative lenis.  He
also had a negative RUQ ultrasound.  He was discharged on a 7
day course of levofloxacin.
