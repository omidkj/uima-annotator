History of Present Illness:
84 year old man with hx of CAD, prior MI, [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
AVR, NIDDM c/b CRI, Left CEA, admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] with CHF
(EF 50%) today now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
He describes that over the last month he has had slowly
increasing edema and dyspnea on exertion. He reports being
compliant with his medications and diet though he drinks around
8 16oz glasses of water a day.
He denies any preceeding symptoms to this exacerbation including
any recent chest pain, dietary indiscretion. In fact he just
notes that he has had a slow increase in his weight that he
thought was due to increasing caloric intake. He approximates
that he has gained 13-15 lbs.
.
He was given 100 mg lasix prior to transfer and had 400 cc urine
output on arrival. He had echo done prior to transfer. Per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] EF was 50%, with 4+ TR and AVR gradient 30mmHG.

CXR:
Admission
FINDINGS: There is status post sternotomy and the metallic
components of porcine aortic valve prosthesis are identified in
place. The heart is moderately enlarged with a clear prominence
of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly. The
lateral view also demonstrates a prominence of the left atrium
in posterior direction. The thoracic aorta is elongated and
demonstrates extensive wall calcifications both in the aortic
root, ascending portion and descending aorta. There is no
evidence of any local aortic contour abnormality. The pulmonary
vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern
and some perivascular haze exists in the lower pulmonary
vascular portions but there is no evidence for significant
interstitial or alveolar edema. Also, the lateral pleural
sinuses are free but very mild blunting of the posterior pleural
sinuses is recognized on the lateral view. Acute parenchymal
infiltrates are not present.

Available for comparison is a previous PA and lateral chest
examination of [**2153-2-1**]. The heart size was significantly
enlarged already on the previous study and findings concerning
cardiac configuration and aortic valve prosthesis are unchanged.
Direct comparison of the frontal views suggests that the
previously observed degree of interstitial edema resulting in
perivascular haze has decreased slightly. As on the previous
examination, there was no evidence of any acute infiltrate nor
is there any pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Status post aortic valve replacement (porcine type)
with cardiac enlargement and mild degree of chronic CHF. No
significant progression during latest four-month examination
interval.

CXR: 7/22IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. No significant
change definite.

[**6-16**] ECHO:LA is mildly dilated. RA is moderately dilated. LV
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. RV chamber size is
increased with free wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic AV
prosthesis is present with thin/mobile leaflets. The transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. MV leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) MR is seen. There is moderate PA systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function. Well
seated aortic  bioprosthesis with mobile leaflets but increased
gradient. Moderate PA systolic hypertension. RV cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Mild MR.

[**6-15**] Right Heart Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography was deferred due to elevated creatinine.

2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and elevated
left sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 21 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg.
There was
severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 78
mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed due to elevated
creatinine.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated left sided filling pressures.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
3. Succesful Swan Ganz catheter placement.on

[**6-15**] Renal US: No hydronephrosis and no new mass is identified
bilaterally. Arterial flow identified in both kidneys but unable
to obtain a full Doppler study due to patient's condition.

[**6-16**] CXR:Interval development of a retrocardiac density which
may be secondary to atelectasis or pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:

 On the floor, diuresesis was attempted with lasix, metolazone,
then nesiritide, without good results, and he was transitioned
from coumadin to heparin, to lovenox (with a notable cr of 3.4,
INR 2.2) to the cath lab for Swan placement for tailored
inotropic therapy for his severe right heart failure. Init
