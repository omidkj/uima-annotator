Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20146**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Open reduction and internal fixation, left acetabular
fracture, with percutaneous technique [**8-4**]
- Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
73 year old man with ESRD on HD, COPD on 1L home O2, CAD, CHF, A
fib on coumadin with pacemaker who was in his usual state of
health until the day prior to admission when he had a mechanical
fall (tripped over socks) at home and fell on his side.  No LOC,
denies injury to head.  Was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**], where
initial vitals were T 97.7, HR 79, RR 20, BP 117/64, 88% on RA
--> 92% on 4LNC.  CT showed left pelvic fracture; he was given 6
mg IV morphine, 1 mg IV dilaudid x 2, and  and 50 mcg fentanyl,
as well as 20 mg KCl in D51/2NS x 1 L and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
orthopedic evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T 97.5, HR 105, BP 121/67,
RR 16, he was hypoxic to 70s on RA, low 80s on 2L and low 90s on
venti mask 8L.  He underwent repeat CT with contrast (with plan
to be dialyzed early), which showed comminuted left acetabular
and pubic rami fractures, intrapelvic hemorrhage/hematoma with
no active extravasation, cirrhosis, infrarenal 3.1 cm AAA, b/l
pleural effusions, RLL patchy infiltrate, and no PE.  He was
seen by orthopedics and trauma surgery, who recommended
percutanous stabilization of the fracture.

Additionally, labs were significant for macrocytic anemia with
Hct 32.1 (unknown baseline), Cr 3.2, INR 1.5, Trop I 0.30 -->
0.32. ECG ventricularly paced and could not be interpreted.  He
was in significant pain and received 8 mg IV morphine, 200 mg IV
fentanyl, and 600 cc NS.  Two units of blood were cross-matched.
On transfer, vitals were T 98.6, HR 80, BP 117/54, (dropped to
SBP 80s after morphine), RR 21, 91% on ventimask.  He was
admitted to the MICU service for further management.

90s, high 80s

IMAGING:
TTE (Complete) Done [**2160-8-4**] at 4:17:16 PM FINAL
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with
global hypokinesis and inferior akinesis. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT TORSO W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2160-8-4**] 3:21 AM
IMPRESSION: 1. Markedly comminuted left acetabular and superior
and inferior pubic rami fractures as detailed above. Associated
extraperitoneal pelvic hemorrhage and hematoma extending into
the perirenal space with no evidence of active extravasation. 2.
Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis. In addition,
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct
measuring up to 10 mm with a rounded intraluminal density, that
may represent a possible stone in its distal aspect (near the
ampulla). 3. Cirrhotic liver with large recanalized umbilical
vein. 4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to
3.1 cm. 5. Left greater than right simple pleural effusions.
Right lower lobe patchy opacification, for which differential
includes aspiration/atelectasis, though infection is not
excluded. 6. Dilation of the main pulmonary trunk which may be
seen in pulmonary hypertension. 7. Emphysematous change.

MICROBIOLOGY:
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2160-8-5**]): NO GROWTH.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2160-8-6**]): No MRSA isolated.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old man with ESRD on HD, COPD on 2L home O2, CAD, CHF,
h/o borderline HIT antibody, Afib on Coumadin with pacemaker who
was admitted for a left acetabular fracture, s/p ORIF
percutaneous pinning procedure on [**8-4**] c/b associated
extraperitoneal pelvic hemorrhage and hematoma extending into
the perirenal space with no evidence of active extravasation.
Required MICU admission for hypoxia likely secondary to CHF
given post-op fluid resuscitation.

# Left pelvic fracture: The patient had a CT which showed a
comminuted fracture of the left acetabulum and the inferior and
superior rami.  He underwent a successful percutaneous open
reduction and internal fixation on [**6-3**] c/b associated
extraperitoneal pelvic hemorrhage and hematoma extending into
the perirenal space with no evidence of active extravasation.
Hematocrit remained stable. Touchdown weight bearing, no range
of motion restrictions per orthopedics. Pain was managed with
oxycodone and acetaminophen.

# Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia on admission was thought to be
secondary to fluid overload after resuscitation in the ED. He
was dialyzed and his respiratory status improved.  He did not
require emergent dialysis post surgery and was able to be
quickly extubated afterwards and transitioned to a shovel mask,
nasal cannula, then room air.

# Systolic CHF:
