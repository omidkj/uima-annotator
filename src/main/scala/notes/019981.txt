Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory insufficiency(pneumonia, hypoxia, asthma/COPD):
in the MICU, it was felt that hypoxia was likely multifactorial
from COPD flare/asthma exacerbation, and intermittent mucous
plugging, in the setting of chronic pulmonary disease.  To treat
possible PNA, pt was started on ceftriaxone (which was switched
to ceftazidime to have pseudomonas coverage given concern for
bronchiectasis), azithromax, and IV hydrocortisone. She was
continued on prn nebs and inhalers, and aggressive chest PT was
given. For her reactive component, [**Doctor First Name 130**], singulair, and
advair were continued. Sputum culture showed respiratory flora,
and legionella antigen was negative.

She was transferred to the floor on [**2124-8-30**]--her antibiotics
had been switched to vancomycin and pip-tazo per ID consult, and
she was on 5L supplemental O2 by nasal cannula (she was never
intubated in the MICU).  They had tried BiPap, but she did not
tolerate this.  She had 2 desat events on [**8-31**] and [**9-1**] to the
70s, which manifested as confusion.  This was thought to be
caused by inability to clear secretions.  We had her on Percocet
to control severe rib pain, in an attempt to reduce her
splinting and help her to clear secretions better.  Our initiall
attempts at BiPap were also unsuccessful, and we started her on
aggressive suctioning, CPT when tolerated, incentive spirometry,
flutter valve, humidified O2, getting OOB daily, and IV fluids
to thin out secretions.  Pulmonary edema showed up on CXR, so we
stopped the IV fluids and diuresed her with Lasix.  The CHF
resolved on CXR. She had no known h/o CHF, but this may have
shown up as a result of her bradycardic episodes while in the
hospital that had since resolved. Initial TTE showed normal EF
so there was question whether her shortness of breath had been
due to volume overload.

She We switched her antibiotics to po levofloxacin, which we
dc'ed on [**2124-9-7**] due to development of presumed C. Diff
infection, and worked to combat atelectasis.  We continued
incentive spirometry, flutter valve, and PT/OOB daily.  Per
pulmonary consult, we got PFTs which showed worsening of her
restrictive disease with no obstructive component, added Flovent
2 puffs 220mg [**Hospital1 **], and started BiPAP 3-4h/day which again she
refused.  We changed her Percocet to Tylenol 1g q6h and
oxycodone prn, to prevent suppression of respiratory drive.  On
[**2124-9-8**], she was weaned off her O2, with sats 90-95.  While on
the floor, we also weaned her IV steroids slightly and then
switched to PO prednisone, which was then fairly quickly
tapered.  She went home on 10mg, with a plan to taper off over 2
weeks.

2.  Increased WBCs/Diarrhea.  On [**2124-9-7**], Mrs.[**Known lastname 104544**] CBCs
showed a white count of 21.8.  Since she had been having
diarrhea and RLQ discomfort a few days prior, it was most likely
she had a C. Diff infection.  We sent her stool for sample which
was negative.  We started empiric Flagyl for C. Diff after 2
days of significantly elevated WBCs but discontinued it after
Cdiff toxin assay came back negative.  We also DC'ed her Foley,
and sent off a U/A which showed yeast infection--we treated her
with three days of fluconazole.  We also took out her central
line and sent the tip for culture which came back positive for
coagulase negative staph and she was restrated on a 5 day course
of vancomycin.  Blood cultures came back negative,  On
[**2124-9-8**], she developed abdominal distention and absence of BM
for 36 hours; we ordered a KUB which came back negative for
obstruction or ileus athough she continued to have abdominal
pain and an elevated WBC so an abdominal CT was obtained.
Abdominal CT was obtained which showed what appeared to be a
large left renal infarct, and after futher review there also
appeared to be a thrombus in the right renal vein. Source workup
including TEE and all four extremity venous ultrasound studies
were obtained all of which were negative, although TEE revealed
a small secundum ASD raising the possiblity of a parodoxical
embolus. Consults from Renal, Urology, Rheumatologyn all of whom
agreed with the plan for a hypercoagulable work-up and
anticoagulate the patient. Hypercoagulability labs sent
included:Factor V Leiden, Protein C and S, B2 glycoprotein,
anti-cardiolipin, antithrombin III mutation, antithrombin Ab,
lupus anticoagulant. She was started on coumadin on [**9-17**] along
with and lovenox and was discharge on
