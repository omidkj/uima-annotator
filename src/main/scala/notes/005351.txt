Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 99181**] is a 76-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2194**], noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, breast
cancer status post bilateral mastectomy, hypothyroidism,
hypertension, and peptic ulcer disease who presented to the
Emergency Department on [**2196-3-14**] for hyperthermia,
bradycardia, and hypotension.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 99181**] was in her usual state of health until the
morning of admission when she was found in her home to be
unresponsive and cyanotic.  She did have a blood pressure and
a pulse.  Upon arrival of the paramedics, she improved with
oxygen but became combative.  She was brought to the
Emergency Department where she was found to be bradycardiac
and hypothermic to 27.0 degrees Celsius.  She was intubated
and given warm, humidified oxygen.  She was sent to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation upon
stabilization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed
coronary artery disease status post two vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2194**]; noninsulin dependent diabetes
mellitus; breast cancer status post bilateral mastectomy;
hypothyroidism; hypertension; osteoarthritis; parietal lobe
AVM; peptic ulcer disease with duodenal ulcer in [**2194**];
gastroesophageal reflux disease; Hemophilus influenzae
pneumonia in [**2191**]; paranoia; history of seizure disorder.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg daily,
Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Levoxyl, Metoprolol 200 mg b.i.d.,
Niferex, Risperdal, Zantac, Pyridoxine.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed
temperature 27.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate 64, blood
pressure 170/60 on 10 mcg of Dopamine, respirations 12,
oxygen saturation 100%.  HEENT examination revealed the head
to be normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils were dilated which
may have been secondary to Atropine given in the Emergency
Room for rapid sequence intubation and were nonicteric.  The
neck revealed no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous
distention.  The patient was intubated.  The chest was clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination was
significant for regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nondistended, and
nontender.  There were no masses present.  Bowel sounds were
present.  The extremities revealed 2+ distal pulses as well
as 2+ edema of all four extremities.  Neurologically, the
patient was moving all four extremities spontaneously.  She
was not following commands and Babinski's were equivocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory studies were as
follows:  White blood cell count 8.6, hematocrit 40.6,
platelets decreased at 35,000.  SMA-7 revealed sodium 146,
potassium 3.7, chloride 110, bicarbonate 25, BUN 43,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 118.  Urinalysis revealed no red
blood cells and no white blood cells.  The pH was 5.0.  ALT
was 275, AST 241, CK 208, amylase 74, alkaline phosphatase
375, lipase 180, albumin 3.4, calcium 9.3, phosphorus 3.8,
magnesium 2.6.  Arterial blood gas on 100% FIO2 revealed
7.39/36/436.  Serum toxicology screen was negative as was
urine toxicology screen.  Electrocardiogram was significant
for left bundle branch block and bradycardia.  There were no
specific ST-T changes.  PR interval was 0.40 seconds.  Chest
x-ray showed no infiltrate and no congestive heart failure
with questionable right lung atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, the patient remained stable in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit from [**2196-3-14**] to [**2196-3-18**].  Pressors were weaned, the patient was extubated,
and the patient was transferred to the regular floor on
[**2196-3-18**].  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
complicated by a fall in hematocrit requiring transfusion of
packed red blood cells on more than one occasion which at the
time of discharge has seemed to correct itself with a current
hematocrit of 33.0.  Platelets as well have increased from a
low level of 34,000 to a normal level at this time.
Hematology is involved in the care of the patient and feels
that the patient would be safe to be transferred to a
rehabilitation facility with followup in approximately three
to four days for a re-draw of her CBC.  The patient's diet
has been advanced to regular as tolerated.  Her hemodynamics
have been stable over the course of the past several days.
At this time, the patient is stable for discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Haldol 1.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
agitation, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Hypothermia.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to
[**Hospital1 28743**] of [**Location (un) **], [**Street Address(2) 99182**], [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 99183**], telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **].
