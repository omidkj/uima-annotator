Date of Birth:   [**2114-10-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 46-year-old male
with a complicated cardiac history including coronary artery
disease status post CABG x2 ([**2139**], [**2152**]), pericardial
constriction status post stripping, diastolic dysfunction,
stable angina (patient no longer an operative candidate per
Cardiothoracic Surgery).  Patient also with history of
diabetes mellitus type 1, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal
insufficiency, and chronic pleural effusion, who is admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on [**2160-10-28**] in decompensated heart
failure.

Patient complained of progressive shortness of breath and
pedal edema as well as an approximately 11 pound weight gain
over the past 2-3 weeks.  While on the floor, diuresis was
attempted with Lasix and nesiritide, but patient's heart
failure was refractory to treatment, in addition he had
worsening renal failure and became hypotensive.  He was
subsequently transferred to the CCU for PA catheterization
and further evaluation of hemodynamics/tailored CHF therapy.

Upon transfer, the patient denied complaints of chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
lightheadedness, or dizziness, fever or chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post CABG '[**39**] with SVG to
LAD and D1 and CABG in '[**52**] with SVG to RCA, and pericardial
stripping secondary to constrictive pericarditis.
Catheterization [**1-20**] reveals 100% LAD lesion with
unsuccessful PTCA attempt, patent D1 and a subtotal D2.
Small [**Last Name (LF) 8714**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-2 subtotally occluded status post PTCA with no
stent, SVG to RCA patent, and SVG to LAD/D1 totally occluded
proximally.  Patient with collateral perfusion of LAD
territory.  Catheterization [**1-20**] also revealed constrictive
physiology with RA approximately equal to PCWP approximately
20 mm Hg.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of
1.4-1.8.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 1 complicated by retinopathy and
nephropathy.
4. CVA secondary to prior CABG.
5. Seizure disorder secondary to CVA.
6. Hyperlipidemia.
7. Gastritis.
8. PVD status post right toe amputation and right fem bypass.
9. Stable angina.
10. Chronic anemia.

3. Tegretol 300 t.i.d.
4. Zestril 10 q.d.
5. Lopressor 100 b.i.d.
6. Aspirin 325.
7. Protonix 40 q.d.
8. Lantus 20 q.a.m., 18 units q.p.m.
9. Humalog sliding scale.
10. Fluvoxamine 12.5 b.i.d.
11. Lipitor 10 q.d.
12. NTGSL prn, patient takes approximately one q.o.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin results in hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with parents.  No tobacco,
EtOH, or drugs.  Currently on disability secondary to stroke.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Dad with "[**Last Name **] problem", diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate 93, blood
pressure 88/60, breathing 18, and satting 97% on room air.
General:  Patient is alert, comfortable, and pleasant in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx
clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, positive
S3, JVD difficult to assess.  Lungs:  Trace rales bilaterally
at bases.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
obese.  Extremities:  3+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Dorsalis
pedis 1+ bilaterally.

DATA:  Chem-7:  Sodium 117, potassium 4.7, chloride 83,
bicarb 25, BUN 60, creatinine 2.0.  CBC:  8.3/28.8/421.

ECG:  Normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis,
flat T waves, no ST changes.

Echocardiogram:  [**10-28**] EF 60%, E/A ratio 1.57, no evidence of
effusion or constriction, trivial MR.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CHF:  Patient was transferred to the CCU and had a PA
catheter placed without complication.  Initial Swan numbers
revealed the following:  CVP 22, PA 64/33, PCWP 30, CO/CI
equals 6.4/2.8, CR 475.

Given patient's etiology for hypotensive on the floor was
unclear and he was found to have elevated wedge pressure.  He
was started on nesiritide drip, which he initially tolerated
well.  Dopamine was added to increase renal perfusion and
enhance diuresis, however, patient became tachycardic and
experienced anginal symptoms which resolved upon
discontinuing dopamine.  Patient's blood pressure remained
stable and given that his heart failure was secondary to
diastolic dysfunction, his beta blocker was titrated back on
board and increased as tolerated, as it was felt that slowing
his heart rate, increasing his filling time would improve his
cardiac function.  Additionally, Lasix drip was added for
further diuresis.  Patient's dry weight per family was noted
to be 205 pounds.

2. Coronary artery disease:  Patient remained chest pain free
throughout stay except for episode of chest pain associated
with dopamine drip.  He is known to have native LAD and SVG
to LAD occlusion with perfusion via collaterals.  He is not
an operative candidate for CT surgery given substantial
mortality associated with third redo CABG, and patient with
longstanding diabetes.  He was continued on aspirin, beta
blocker, and statin, Imdur, and prn NPG.

3. Hyponatremia:  Etiology felt related to either SIADH
secondary to his SSRI or Tegretol or CHF.  Urine electrolytes
were more consistent with SIADH picture, however, patient was
hypervolemic and urine electrolytes can be confounded in the
setting of diuretic therapy.  Tegretol was felt to be an
unlikely etiology as this patient had been on this medication
for many years with no prior history of hyponatremia.  His
SSRI was felt to be more a likely potential etiology.  Thus a
psych consult was obtained for help with an appropriate
alternative if any.

Patient's sodium improved slowly over the course of his stay
with 1000 cc fluid restriction.

4. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency and
initially elevated creatinine.  Once transferred to the CCU,
the patient's creatinine initially declined and then remained
stable at prior baseline value of even in the setting of
continued diuresis.  Urinalysis was sent which was negative
for any evidence of ATN contributing to his renal disease.

5. Anemia:  Patient required several transfusions while
in-house.  He had no evidence of active bleeding, was guaiac
negative, and additionally had no evidence of hemolysis.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease
most likely secondary to longstanding renal failure.

6. Diabetes mellitus:  Patient was initially maintained on
his home insulin regimen, however, his p.m. lantus had to be
decreased while in-house secondary to low fingersticks in the
a.m.
