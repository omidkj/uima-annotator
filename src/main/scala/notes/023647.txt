Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension/Afib w/RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Line placed

History of Present Illness:
79 yo F w/ nonischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20% s/p BiV pacer [**8-31**],
PAF, DMII, h/o DVT, PE [**2-1**] on coumadin, recurrent C.diff
presents as OSH transfer with hypotension from presumed
urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with RVR, NSTEMI, and acute on
chronic renal failure.
.
At the OSH, she presented on [**2168-11-4**] with chief complaint of
weakness and fatigue. The was found to be hypotensive with SBP
70s with a UA consistent with UTI, WBC 18.1 and she was started
on zosyn initially due to her multiple drug allergies which was
then switched to Primaxin and she was fluid resuscitated. On the
day of transfer, Tm 104, and she was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR to 180s. Amiodarone bolus (50mg IV x1)and
gtt(1mg/min x6 hours then 0.5mg/min) were initiated and she
received 250mcg digoxin IV x2. She was found to be hypotensive
and a CVL was placed and levophed was started. She also received
stress dose steroids with IV hydrocort 100mg. She was noted to
have a hematocrit drop from 29.1 on admission to 27.3 on the day
of transfer. Guiac stool was negative. Flu swab was negative.
Creatinine found to be 2.6 from baseline of 1.3-1.5. Troponin
was elevated with peak at 0.24 with CK 18
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA,  bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain and has no limitation in
walking. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2168-11-7**] CT abd/pelvis IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and interstitiell changes in the
lungs
consistent with CHF.
2. abnormality in the right rectus muscle most consistent with
subacute
rectus sheet hematoma (correlate with history of
anticoagulation)
3. Anasarca.
4. Vertebral body deformity of L3, stable. Vertebral body
deformity of T12
with interval worsening and now appears completely collapsed.
5. Scout image of chest suboptimal for evaluation of left IJ
placement due to multiple overlying lines.
.
[**11-9**]: Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**],
the left ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current
study. The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased
significantly. The degree of aortic stenosis has incrased
slightly. LV systolic function remains severely depressed,
although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as on
the prior study.
.
[**2168-11-10**] CT head:
1. No acute hemorrhage, no acute vascular territorial
infarction.

[**2168-11-14**] LUE U/S:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm

[**2168-11-14**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
1. No evidence of pancreatitis.
2. Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions, increased in
size since the prior study, most c/w CHF. Bibasilar atelectasis,
left greater than right.
3. Subacute rectus sheath hematoma remains stable in size and
appearance.
4. Anasarca.

[**2168-11-19**] B/L LENIs:
1. No DVT of either lower extremity.
2. Calf veins not visualized of either leg.
