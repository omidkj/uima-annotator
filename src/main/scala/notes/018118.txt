Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Sulfonamides / Mevacor / Dicloxacillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Failed graft

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pelvic angiography with left lower extremity run off. This
corresponds with CPT [**Numeric Identifier 7534**], [**Numeric Identifier 4238**], and [**Numeric Identifier 8881**].

PROCEDURES:

1. Thrombectomy of left femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft.
2. Resection of left vein graft aneurysm.
3. Left femoral-to-peroneal bypass graft with arm vein.
4. Harvest of left arm basilic vein.
5. Angioscopy, vein inspection and valve lysis.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of bilateral
bypass grafts. The one on her index leg has been patent since
[**2161**]. She presented somewhat acutely with a cold, blue foot. She
was heparinized and taken to the
angio suite which showed, as expected, occlusion of whole bypass
graft and, unfortunately, only reconstitution was a peroneal
artery that was not in continuity with the ankle.

There was a collateral that then fed into the anterior tibial
artery. There was no percutaneous treatment that could be
performed. Lysis or an AngioJet of the vein graft was not
realistic given the size of the graft and the size of the
clot as well as the age of the patient. The patient underwent
vein mapping and, unfortunately, only had one segment of basilic
vein. The decision was made to try to thrombectomize the graft
and do a revision down to the peroneal artery as
the only chance. The family and the patient were told that the
likelihood of success was moderate at best and if it did not
work that there would be no further treatment possible.


Past Medical History:
Peripheral vascular disease s/p multiple bypass surgeries.
CAD s/p MI in [**2163**] (last echo in [**7-12**]. Trace AR, MR, TR,
significant pulmonary regurgitation)
Atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker placement.
GERD.
Dysphagia with food impaction
Osteoarthritis.
Osteoporosis.
Diverticulitis.
Hypothyroidism.
Depression.
Lower extremity ulcers with positive MRSA in the past.


Social History:
Pt presents from home, where she has close care. No tobacco, no
alcohol, no drugs. The patient was an exercise instructor. She
is widowed. She has no children.

INTERPRETATION:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the
basal septum.  Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Overall normal  LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Minimally increased gradient c/w minimal AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild
(1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate  [[**12-12**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:

There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal
septum. The  left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased  gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2169-7-17**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension
detected has increased.  Otherwise, no change.
