Admission Date:  [**2135-12-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-12-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2078-1-25**]       Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old woman with
a history of a recent stroke, asthma, insulin-dependent
diabetes, and renal disease who was at Stone Hinge
Convalescent Center and noted to have changes in her behavior

On the day of admission at 2:25 p.m. she had an episode of
unresponsiveness and then she developed status epilepticus at
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital. She received 6 mg of Ativan and Versed as well
loaded on Dilantin intravenously.  At that time she was intubated
and then transferred to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit.

Congestive heart failure, stroke, lupus, asthma,
insulin-dependent diabetes, renal disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Synthroid 0.1, Catapres
transdermal patch 2 every week, Novolin NPH 24 units,
Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., [**Doctor First Name 233**] Ciel,
hydralazine, furosemide, Flovent, calcium, Milk of Magnesia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Blood pressure 217/97,
heart rate 119, 100% on room air.  Rectal temperature of 100.
Cardiovascular revealed tachycardia with a 2/6 systolic
murmur.  Chest revealed bilateral crackles, low breath sounds
(left compared to right).  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis
or edema.  Neurologically, intubated and sedated, positive
tongue abrasion.  Held her right hand in fist with eyes
contracted.  Right leg flexed spontaneously.  Did not follow
commands.  Pupils revealed left 4 mm to 5 mm, right 3.5 mm,
reactive to light bilaterally.  No blink to visual threat.
Extraocular movements appeared conjugate.  Left side had
decreased abduction with dolls.  Positive occasional right
nystagmus with dolls.  No obvious facial asymmetry which was
difficult to tell with a tube in place.  Positive gag.
Positive cough.  Motor revealed spontaneously moved the right
side more than the left.  Spontaneous movement in the right
upper and lower extremities.  Positive withdrawal to pain on
the left lower extremity.  Positive extension to pain in the
left upper extremity.  Her reflexes were symmetric
bilaterally with upgoing toes bilaterally, 4+ on the right
ankle, 1+ on the left ankle.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
basic laboratories with a white blood cell count of 15.8, a
hematocrit of 32.2.  Normal electrolytes except for her blood
glucose which was 336.  PT, PTT, and INR were normal.  Her
urinalysis showed 0 to 2 white blood cells, and rare
bacteria.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Head CT done at the time showed only
chronic microvascular changes.  No infarct.  No axillar
hemorrhage.

Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacity, a question of
atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the
Neurolgy Intensive Care Unit and followed.  Blood
pressure was controlled.  She was moving all extremities to
pain, left greater than right.  Slight increased tone on the
right side.
She was started on a maintenance dose of Dilantin. Acute coronary
artery syndrome was r/o with serial EKGs, creatine kinases and
troponin.  Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive
encephalomalacia change in atrophy from multiple old infarct.  No
acute infarct.  MRA at the same time was read as motion artifact,
severely aluminated the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], visualized internal
carotid arteries were likely vertebrobasilar system patent;
however, the patient after extubation had new left arm weakness
which was not at her baseline.  When the stroke team reviewed her
MRA they felt that she could possibly have basilar artery
stenosis; and, therefore, she was started on a heparin drip.

Prior to that a workup for the seizure included a lumbar
puncture which was unrevealing with 1 white blood cell, no
red blood cells, and a differential of 65% lymphocytes,
30% monocytes, and 5% polys.  Glucose was 126.  No protein
was sent.

She was continued on Synthroid.  Her serum glucose was
controlled.  She did require an insulin drip at one point
until she started eating again.  In addition, she had an
electroencephalogram on [**12-20**] which showed very low
voltage background with beta in most areas, not epileptiform.

She was transferred out from the NICU to the Neurologyfloor on
[**2135-12-22**] and remained stable on a heparin drip.  Her PTT
was kept between 60 and 80.  Her blood pressure was watched
carefully.
At the time she was transferred she was alert and oriented times
hospital.  She felt well, and she was consistently following
commands.  She moved her right arm and had some difficulty
moving her left arm.  Her Dilantin levels were followed and
on [**12-22**] it was 9.3.  She was bolused with Dilantin with
subsequent repeat being 10.9, and her chronic dose was
increased.  During her stay, her hematocrit fell to 28.  Because
of her diabetes and risk factors for coronary artery disease, she
was transfused 2 units with a repeat hematocrit of 34 on
[**2135-12-25**].  We continued to follow her hematocrit, and
again it dipped down to 28, and she needed to receive another
transfusion.  Her Dilantin was continued, and her mental
status improved.
She was started on Levaquin for a possible aspiration
pneumonia and then found to have urinary tract infection, and
thus the Levaquin was continued.  Her urine grew out
Staphylococcus aureus and group B strep.  She was started on
vancomycin and continued on the levofloxacin.  The
sensitivities studies showed methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, and a peripherally inserted central
catheter line was placed for a prolonged course of
vancomycin.  Vancomycin peak and trough was checked on
[**2135-12-29**] which showed a peak of 22 and a trough of
10.9, which seemed adequate and continued on the vancomycin
dose 500 mg q.24h.
The patient's neurologic examination improved with her able
to have antigravity movement with her left hand.  Her heparin
was discontinued after the second hematocrit drop, and
Gastrointestinal was consulted.  They had originally planned
to take her for upper and lower endoscopy; however, her
daughter did not want any intervention unless the patient had
life threatening problems, and after the discontinuation of
the heparin, her hematocrit remained stable.  The patient was
then started on Plavix for stroke prophylaxis since she had
an aspirin allergy.  Her stools were consistent
guaiac-positive through the hematocrit drops, and thus we
thought that the source was gastrointestinal.
