Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, COPD, NSCLC s/p L superior
segmentectomy in [**2147**], systolic dysfunction (EF 30%), recently
started on home O2, who presents with complaints of increasing
shorness of breath over the past day. He has also noted
increased wheezing. He states that he self d/c'd his home O2 to
"see how he would do". He became more short of breath over last
night, and restarted his home O2 at that time without
improvement. The patient denies fever, cough, chest pain, sputum
production, rhinorrhea, orthopnea, PND, or increased leg
swelling. He admits to intentional 7 lb weight loss recently.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's vitals were: T 97.5 BP
155-197/91-142 P 96-120 R 16-32 Sat 85%RA and 100% on CPAP [**6-11**]
with 50% FiO2. He was noted to have LLL ronchi and was using his
accessory muscles to breath. He was given Azithromycin, CTX,
flagyl, Solumedrol 125 mg IV, A/A nebs, ASA 325 mg. CPAP was
initiated with notable improvement in the pts oxygenation. CXR
revealed a left mid lung field PNA. CTA was negative for PE but
did show intralobular septal thickening c/w edema or
lymphangitic spread. ABG on CPAP was: 7.37/56/61.

Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p silent IMI; no prior interventions
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Hypertension
- CHF, systolic, EF 30% by echo (Echo [**2150-2-26**]: Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely
depressed(ejection fraction 30 percent)secondary to severe
hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall and
akinesis of the posterior (inferolateral) wall; the rest of the
left ventricle also appears at least mildly hypokinetic)
- COPD
- H/o actinic keratosis s/p cryotherapy [**2-/2150**]
- Seborrheic Keratosis
- H/o T1N0M0 NSCLC s/p L superior segmentectomy [**10/2147**]
- New lung nodule on CT of [**2149-12-30**]: surveillance CT in
[**2149-12-3**] identified a new right lower lobe nodule which was
found to be FDG PET avid. He underwent bronchoscopy at the end
of [**2150-1-2**]. The cytology from this examination was
unrevealing, however, the bronchoalveolar lavage grew an
atypical mycobacterium, Mycobacterium kansasii. This is felt to
be a colonizer. Subsequently, he had two induced sputa which
were negative with no growth. Subsequent CT scan in Feruary
showed decreased size of this RLL lesion. At this point this
lung nodule is felt to be related to aspiration.
- BPH
- Schatzki's Ring

refusing head imaging to eval for mets
- Silent aspiration per video swallow eval in [**3-10**]


Social History:
Denies tobacco use; quit smoking 15 yrs ago; There is a history
of alcohol abuse but he states he now abstains. Reports
extensive travel during his life, including many parts of the

time imprisoned in [**Country 5142**] for dealings in the black market.

history of cancer in his family. There are many alcoholics on
both sides of his family. His mother reportedly died of TB.

Micro: Blood cultures on admission without growth to date.
.
EKG: poor baseline, ?MAT, one PVC, old TWI V5-V6, nl axis, rate
104 bpm
.
Imaging:
CTA: 1.  No evidence of PE. 2.  New basal intralobular septal
thickening and somewhat nodular interstitial prominence along
with more scattered indistinct opacities bilaterally. Diagnostic
considerations include pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of
malignancy, and infection. 3.  Previously described pulmonary
nodules not significantly changed in size compared to the prior
study. 4.  Left greater than right small pleural effusions. 5.
Cholelithiasis.
.
CXR: Allowing for the rotation of the patient, cardiomediastinal
contour is unremarkable. Consolidation in the mid left lung
field is new as are increased interstitial markings in the right
lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural
effusions. IMPRESSION: Left mid lung field pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
A/P: 68 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, COPD, NSCLC s/p L superior
segmentectomy in [**2147**], systolic dysfunction (EF 30%), recently
started on home O2, who presented with hypoxic respiratory
distress and PNA.
.
# Hypoxia. The patient has a history of COPD, NSCLC s/p
lobectomy in [**2147**], and silent aspiration. He also is known to
have atypical mycobacteria in the lung, thought to be
colonization. He describes poor understanding of using
continuous home oxygen and has signs of left middle lobe
infiltrate on chest x-ray. Given pts wheezing and progressive
SOB, he seems to be having a COPD flare in the setting of an
apparent PNA. Also of question is the septal thickening on CT
concerning for lymphangitic carcinoma. The patient was admitted
overnight to the ICU where he was continued on steroids
(solumedrol 80mg IV q8h), antibiotics (azithromycin and
amp-sulbactam) as well as albuterol and ipratropium nebs. The
patient showed improvement overnight weaning first to a 35% face
tent then 96% on 3L NC. He was transferred to the floor where
his regimen was changed to oral levofloxacin and oral
prednisone. The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale
while on steroids. He continued to receive supplemental oxygen
per his home regimen. He continued on albuterol and ipratropium
nebs. The patient was also started on inhaled
fluticasone/salmeterol dosing. Urine legionella is negative.
Sputum culture and blood cultures are without growth. The
patient's case was reviewed with his primary thoracic
oncologist. He will follow-up with a repeat chest CT within the
next 2 months for further evaluation of intralobular septal
thickening.
.
# Neurologic. Dementia, incontinence, gait disturbance and
silent aspiration described in recent primary care notes.
Differential includes Alzheimer's, normal pressure
hydrocephalus, late stage syphilis and microvascular disease.
Less likely is  metastatic disease. Syphilis screening negative.
The patient had an unremarkable MRI/A of the brain. He will
follow-up as previously scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  of
neurology 3 days after discharge for further outpatient work-up.

.
# 2 episodes of lightheadedness. The patient had a complaint of
2 episodes of lightheadedness and change in vision. These
episodes lasted for seconds and were associated with turning of
the head to the right. The patient was NOT able to reproduce the
symptoms on exam now did he have any other focal neurologic
deficits. He had no carotid bruits. His baby aspirin was
increased to ful
