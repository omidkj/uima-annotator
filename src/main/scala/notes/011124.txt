Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
found down with left-sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheostomy and PEG

History of Present Illness:
Reason for Consult: R thalamic hemorrhage

HPI: The pt is a 58-year-old left-handed male with history of
hepatitis C admitted with R thalamic hemorrage.  On [**2118-3-4**], he
was found on his kitchen floor by his neighbor with difficulty
speaking and [**Name (NI) 86478**] weakness.  He was evaluated at [**Hospital3 **]
whre head CT revealed R thalamic hemorrhage with spread to the
ventricles.  Also, CTA revealed 4 mm ACOM aneurysm.  He was
intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on the neurosurgery
service.  By report, he was able to follow commands prior to
intubation. In the ICU, his exam has remained stable notable for

L hemiplegia, intact cranial nerve response, and intact mental
status.  He was able to be extubated.  He has had two repeat
head
CT's which are stable.

CT head [**2118-3-4**]
FINDINGS: The right basal ganglia parenchymal hemorrhage with
extension into
the right thalamus is unchanged from the previous study, with a
rim of
surrounding vasogenic edema. A 3-mm left periventricular
hypodensity
consistent with hemorrhage is unchanged from the previous study.
A large
amount of intraventricular blood is unchanged, involving the
right greater
than left ventricles, the third ventricle, and fourth ventricle
extending
bilaterally through the foramen of Luschka. The basal cisterns
are preserved.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains normally preserved.
The visualized
paranasal sinuses demonstrate minimal left ethmoid mucosal
thickening, but are
otherwise clear. The mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized
and aerated.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged right parenchymal hemorrhage centered in
the right
thalamus, with extensive intraventricular hemorrhage. Size of
ventricles is
unchanged from the previous study.

MRI +/- [**3-8**]
1. Right thalamic hemorrhage, with secondary intraventricular
extension as
well as subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is no evidence of an
underlying mass
lesion or vascular malformation, and the findings likely are
secondary to a
hypertensive hemorrhagic event.

However, given the subtle enhancing focus in the left centrum
semiovale,
non-specific, a follow-up MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]- and post-contrast imaging
is
recommended in six to eight weeks' time, as the right thalamic
hemorrhage
resolves, to further exclude an underlying lesion, and to
reassess the finding
in the left frontal lobe.

2. 8-mm aneurysm involving the anterior communicating artery, as
on the CTA
performed at [**Hospital6 2561**]. This appears to be distinct
and separate
from the multifocal hemorrhage, with no evidence of subarachnoid
blood in the
cistern of the lamina terminalis or suprasellar cistern, and is
likely
incidental.

Abdominal US [**2118-3-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No focal liver lesion and no biliary dilatation.

2. Gallstones seen within a contracted gallbladder.

3. Trace of ascites and a left pleural effusion

CT chest [**2118-3-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia, worst in the left lower lobe.
2. Small left-sided pleural effusion.
3. Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. Likely reactive.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old man who has a right thalamic hemorrhage with IVH.
Etiology of the hemorrhage may be related to coagulopathy due to
liver dysfunction from Hepatitis C. in the context of
hypertension, as this is a typical location for a hypertensive
bleed. He was also found to have an incidental ACOM aneurysm.
He was initially admitted to the neurosurgery service but
subsequently transferred to neurology.
.
Hospital Course by problem;
.
Neurology; The patient was monitored in the neuro ICU with SBP
120-160, MAP < 110, HOB > 30 and neuro checks q1h.  His
examination and repeat CT scans remained stable.  An MRI brain
showed no evidence of underlying mass, but was once again
notable for the ACOM aneurysm.  He will undergo a repeat CTA of
his head in six months to evaluate for any progression in size
of the aneurysm, to be followed up by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  He was
continued on methadone at a lower dose (decreased due to
somnolence).
.
ID; The patient had persistent fevers with leukocytosis.  The
patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for a presumed
ventilator-associated pneumonia, although culture data was
negative.  One blood culture (out of eight sets) was notable for
coag negative staph which was presumed to be a contaminate.
Antibiotics were discontinued after a four day course.  He
continued to spike temperatures and underwent a CT chest
indicative of multifocal pneumonia as well as a cavitary LUL
lesion.  Infectious disease was consulted and on [**3-10**] he began
an 8-day course of vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl (to be
completed [**3-18**]) and is currently had AFB x3 sputum samples
negative to rule out TB.  He is known to have chronic nocardia
infection and has been treated with doxycycline for this in the
past.  In consultation with ID, this was discontinued.  An HIV
test was negative.  On [**3-15**] the patient was found to have
aspergillus fumigatus from a sputum sample [**3-10**] with one colony
on one plate.  Infectious disease has been following, and did
not recommend treatment at this time.
.
Pulm; The patient has a history of COPD and was continued on
albuterol and atrovent nebulizers.  The patient was extubated
for approximately 24 hours
