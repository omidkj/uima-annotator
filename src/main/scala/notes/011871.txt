CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Ischemic ulcer of the right heel.

Information was obtained from the daughters and computer
records.  The patient is not a reliable historian.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 84 year old non-diabetic
white female with known coronary artery disease status post
angioplasty with stent placement of the left anterior
descending and left circumflex in [**2193-1-16**], with a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy,
hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism,
CML, myeloproliferative disorder and asthma, who developed a
right heel ulcer in late [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.  She was
ambulating with a walker at home and developed a small area
of redness without any known trauma.  She has had prior
symptoms of right calf claudication.

During the preoperative cardiac evaluation, the patient had a
positive Dobutamine stress and echocardiogram at [**Hospital6 11896**] on [**2195-1-21**].  The following day, the
patient had a cardiac catheterization and after an episode of
hypertension and developed a left groin hematoma which
required emergent repair of the left common femoral artery by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was then
transferred here for angioplasty and stent placement on
[**2195-1-29**].

The patient was admitted [**3-12**] until [**3-16**], to the Medical
Service for right leg arteriogram which showed right SFA
disease and severe disease of the run-off vessels.  The
patient was discharged to [**Last Name (un) 38746**] Nursing Center.  She was
seen in the office on [**2195-3-19**], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
scheduled for elective bypass graft.  The patient is now
admitted for surgery.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed.  She lives with her daughter
and is currently at rehabilitation.  She uses a walker at
home.  She has had blood transfusions in the past; the most
recent was in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.  She is a nonsmoker and
nondrinker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 98.8 F.; 178/52; 58; 20.
She is an alert female.  Her HEENT examination was
unremarkable.  Carotids are palpable without bruits.  The
radial pulses are palpable.  The femoral pulses are palpable
bilaterally.  The right popliteal is nonpalpable.  The
dorsalis pedis is monophasic signal on the right and the
posterior tibial is non-Doppler-able or palpable.  The left
popliteal is palpable with a Doppler-able dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial on the left.  The lungs show a few coarse
rhonchi in the left base.  The heart is a regular rate and
rhythm without murmur.  Abdominal examination was
unremarkable.  She does have an abrasion on the sacrum which
is tender to palpation.  Joint examination shows feet equally
warm with mild foot/ankle edema on the right.  There is a
large 3.5 cm dry gangrenous ulcer to the right heel with some
fresh bloody drainage on the dressing.  It is tender to
palpation.  There is no odor or fluctuance.  The patient is
alert and oriented to self; not to date or place.  She knows
she is here to have surgery to bring back her foot to heal.

LABORATORY:  On admission included a CBC with a white count
of 31.3.  Hematocrit 35.0; platelets 326,000.  BUN 17,
creatinine 1.3, potassium 4.5, glucose 110.  PT, INR and PTT
were normal.

A urinalysis showed white blood cells were positive with 11
red blood cells and 9 white blood cells.

Chest x-ray showed a small left pleural effusion.

EKG was a sinus rhythm, normal axis deviation; no acute
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent, on [**2195-3-25**], a
right common femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass with in situ
greater saphenous vein in angioscopy.  She tolerated the
procedure well.  She was transferred to the PACU for
continued monitoring and care.

Postoperatively, the patient had a drop in her hematocrit
from 26 to 20 with low urinary output.  Nipride drip was
started with improvement in her urinary output.  She received
three units of packed red blood cells with a post-hematocrit
of 36.  The right foot was warm with palpable graft pulse and
Doppler-able dorsalis pedis.  She had a small hematoma on the
left thigh; otherwise remained on her Nipride for blood
pressure control.

She was followed perioperatively by Cardiology.  Her EKG was
without changes.  She received Protamine to reverse her
coagulopathy.

The Urology Service was consulted because of her anuria.
They agree with aggressive volume resuscitation and agreed
with cycling cardiac enzymes and follow her potassium closely
at q. six hours along with her calcium phosphatase and
replete magnesium.  A Clonidine patch was reinstituted with
improvement in her systolic blood pressure control and her
SVR and increase in cardiac index of 2.78, with improvement
in her urinary output with resolving of her acute renal
vasoconstriction.

The Nitroglycerin was weaned and the patient was begun on
Dopamine renal dosing with continued improvement in her renal
function and urinary output.  Hematocrit remained stable at
30.  Her hematoma was not enlarged.  There was no active
drainage from the incision wounds.  She had a palpable graft
pulse and Doppler-able dorsalis pedis.  She remained on bed
rest.

Postoperative day three, the renal dosed Dopamine was
discontinued.  She continued to show clinically and by
creatinine, improvement in her renal function.  Her
creatinine was back to baseline of 1.2.  Her hematocrit was
29.8.  She required a mild diuresis.  Her renal Dopamine was
discontinued on postoperative day four.  On postoperative day
five, her arterial line was discontinued.  Diuresis was
continued.  She received another unit of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 32.  Her vascular examination
remained unchanged.  Her hematoma remained stable.  Her PA
line was converted to CVL on postoperative day number five
without incident.

Postoperative day six, she had an episode of a 33-beat run of
asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia.  Her electrolytes were
unremarkable.  Her CPK was 33; her troponin less than 0.3.
She was continued on aggressive Physical Therapy.  Chest
therapy and diuresis continued and repletion of electrolytes.

Postoperative day number eight, there was noted some
ecchymotic and dry eschar
