Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2534**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Motor vehicle crash

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
67 yo female s/p motor vehicle crash vs. pole at approx 40 MPH;
? if fell asleep vs. syncopal episode this morning at the wheel.
She was taken to an area hospital where a CT scan of the neck
showed C2 vertebral foramina fracture, and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further managment. Her GCS was 15 upon arrival; she was also
complaining of pain in the back of her head and neck, but denies
weakness and numbness/tingling, though she does have severe pain
from her
orthopaedic injuries, including a left wrist fracture.


Past Medical History:
ONC HISTORY (per OMR, previous discharge summaries):
Ms. [**Known lastname 103705**] was diagnosed with her lymphoma following preop
workup in preparation for Nissen fundiplication mid-[**Month (only) 404**]
[**2116**]. During her pre-operative workup, a CXR showed a R
mediastinal mass. Since then, she has had multiple CT/MRIs for
further workup. Noted to have extensive lymphadenopathy both
above and below the diaphragm. Right cervical LN biopsy ([**2116-12-23**])
showed involvement by high grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma,
best classified as diffuse large B-cell-type. By
immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells are diffusely
immunoreactive for pan-B-cell marker CD20 with coexpression of
bcl-2, CD10 (minor subset), and bcl-6 (subset). The neoplastic
cells do not coexpress bcl-1 or CD5. Pan T-cell markers CD3 and
CD5 highlight background T-cells. By MIB-1 staining, the
proliferation fraction amongst large neoplastic cells is greater
than 90%. In-situ hybridization studies for [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Virus
encoded RNA ([**Last Name (un) **]), was negative.
Restaging PET scans ([**2117-2-8**] and [**2117-3-24**]) revealed further
reduction in her disease burden. Course has been complicated by
peripheral neuropathy that was present prior to initiation of
chemotherapy but has been exacerbated by vincristine toxicity.
Now s/p 6 cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **].
Last cycle [**Date range (1) 101391**]. Tolerated well. Complicated by some dyspnea
during course that responded to d/c of standing fluids and 10 IV
lasix.

NONCONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, edema, mass effect, or evidence of
infarct.
Hyperostosis frontalis is and a subcentimeter left frontal sinus
osteoma are
incidentally noted. There is no evidence of calvarial injury.
Comminuted
odontoid fracture is better evaluated on concurrent CT C- spine
performed at
outside hospital.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


C-spine [**2117-7-23**]
FINDINGS: Please note that the study is markedly limited due to
patient
positioning, technique, and overlying collar. The known
fractures at C2 is
not well seen on this study. Prevertebral soft tissues appear
slightly
prominent.

IMPRESSION:

Known C2 fracture is not well seen on this radiograph due to
technique and
collar. Please refer to prior outside imaging for additional
reporting.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2117-4-27**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality as
the patient was difficult to position. The rhythm appears to be
atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal / borderline (LVEF 50-55%). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted given the spine fracture. Initial discussions took
place between team and family regarding Halo placement; after
much discussions the decision was to manage the fracture non
operatively with a cervical collar that includes a thoracic
extension. This brace is not to be removed at all unless until
follow up with Neurosurgery in 2 weeks. She has experienced
