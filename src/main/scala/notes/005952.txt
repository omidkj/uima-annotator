Conclusions
Prebypass
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is severely dilated. The aortic
arch is moderately dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**2130-10-6**] at 900 am.
Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving a infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Graft material
seen in the ascending aorta. Mild aortic insufficiency persists.
Rest of examination is unchanged from prebypass. Aorta is
intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41757**] was admitted with an incidental finding of an
ascending aortic aneurysm during work-up for a complaint of
worsening cough.  She underwent a pre-operative work-up.  She
was brought to the Operating Room on [**2130-10-6**] and underwent an
ascending aortic aneurysm replacement.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  On waking she did not follow commands and
did not move her right upper extremity.  She was re-sedated
overnight.  The following day she was again woken while
witholding narcotics and she presented with a simlilar exam.  A
head CT was performed which was negative for an acute
intracranial process.  A neurology consult was obtained.  She
was weaned from vasopressor support.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  She was treated
with amiodarone for post-operative atrial fibrillation and
converted to a sinus rhythm.   Beta blocker was initiated and
the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
She was able to be extubated with the aid of precedex on
post-operative day 5.  Zosyn was started to treat possible
pneumonia.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  On
post-operative day seven her neurological deficits persisted so
an MRI was performed.  This study revealed likely global
cortical hypoxia.  By the time of discharge on POD 11 the
patient remained abulic with a flaccid right upper extremity and
vision loss.  Her sternal wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital1 **], [**Location (un) 86**] with appropriate follow up instructions.
