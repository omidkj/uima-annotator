Midline intravenous line

History of Present Illness:
59 yo M w/hx multiple sclerosis, neurogenic bladder,
schizoaffective disorder, s/p trach, sacral decubitus ulcers,
and hx VRE/MRSA UTI and recurrent aspiration pneumonia presents
from the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU with fever to 102 rectal, hypotension
to 50s/palp, and heart rate in the 130s, with tachypnea with RR
30s. Patient is a long term [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident, and was
admitted to the MACU for treatment of pneumonia and urosepsis
with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, and IVF. In
the MACU patient's labs revealed ARF with creatinine of 2.7, as
well as an elevated WBC of 51 with 21% bands. However, today, IV
access was unable to be obtained at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, and patient
was brought to the ED, where he received 4L IVF, and had a
femoral line placed due to concern for sepsis. Patient's BP
increaed from 70s-130s systolic, but then dropped to 80s, at
which point levophed gtt was started. He received vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and metronidazole in the ED prior to transfer.
Patient is nonverbal at baseline but denies any pain.

ECG ([**2-9**]): Sinus tachycardia. Early transition. Other than
rate, no diagnostic abnormality. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2119-10-7**] no significant change.

SUPINE AP CHEST ([**2-10**]):  A tracheostomy is in place at the
thoracic inlet.  There are low lung volumes.  The upper lungs
are clear.  There is bibasilar volume loss. Heart size is
difficult to assess, although it is likely normal.  The aortic
contour is unchanged from prior studies.  No pneumothorax.  No
definite effusion is seen.  There is marked right convex
scoliosis of the thoracic spine, limiting the evaluation.
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, without definite evidence of
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104995**] is a 59 yo M w/multiple sclerosis and neurogenic
bladder, with hx MRSA/VRE UTIs who presents with fever,
hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate and a positive UA
c/w sepsis.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Urosepsis: Patient had fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
elevated lactate c/w sepsis, with potential sources on admission
being urine, sacral decubitus ulcer, and lung, with his trach
and copious secretions.  He received approx 5L IVF within the
first 12h of admission to the ICU (plus IVF given at rehab prior
to transfer).  He also intermittently required pressors for BP
support during the first 36 hours.  These were weaned well
before transfer back to rehab.  GNR rapidly grew from sputum an
