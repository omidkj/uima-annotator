Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
N/V/D

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
87yoW with h/o . She presented to [**Hospital6 33**] [**2192-2-27**]
with complaint of abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood-streaked
diarrhea. She denied fevers at that time. Initial CT scan
diagnosed ileitis of the distal ileum, and she was treated with
iv levofloxacin/metronidazole, and kept NPO. Repeat CT showed
improvement in inflammation, but she failed po trial, and
continues to have nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. She
underwent upper and lower endoscopies and small bowel follow
through studies that were nondiagnostic, showing only a small
patch of cecal inflammation and left diverticulosis. She has
been evaluated by GI and surgical services at [**Hospital1 34**]. Stools
studies for c.difficile were negative. She developed a non-anion
gap metabolic acidosis, thought to be due to ongoing diarrhea.
TTG was 3, ANCA negative, stool cultures negative. She was to be
transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] for capsule endoscopy, but as bed was not
available, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluatin
and treatment.
.
On presentation now she complains of continued bilateral lower
quadrant abdominal pain, L>R, nausea, diarrhea, and also of LLE
pain. The LLE pain developed while hospitalized at [**Hospital1 34**]. Doppler
U/S was negative for DVT there.

.
CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Presacral soft tissue stranding of unclear etiology, but
indicates inflammatory process at this site. This is of unclear
clinical significance.
Has the patient had prior radiation?
2. Inflammatory fat stranding within the subcutaneous tissues of
the back.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left) with
associated atelectasis.
4. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation that is
likely secondary to cholecystectomy and likely chronic.Mo
retained stones are seen.Correlation with LFTs is recommended.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is a mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
HEAD CT:
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. There are again
noted mild periventricular changes of small vessel disease.
There is prominence of ventricles and sulci, consistent with
age-related mild involutional change. Noted again are vascular
calcifications. Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are well aerated. Osseous structures are unremarkable.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) NAUSEA/VOMITING:
At OSH, pt had evidence of ileitis on CT scan.  Repeat CT here
showed resolution of this.  It was likely an infectious
enteritis.  This may have provoked N/V that is persisting due to
IBS or another cause.  Medications effect was considered and
pt's pain regimen was altered and digoxin dose was reduced.  In
addition, a head CT was done to r/o intracranial mass lesion.
Before discharge, she was tolerated simple small meals.  She was
also started on TPN for supplementation.
.
2) SVT:
Pt went into an SVT, likely afib or aflutter with RVR and
required admission to ICU.  There her nodal blocking agents were
titrated up.  Dig was increased to 0.375.  With this her rate
was controlled and her rhthym was subsequently mostly sinus.
However, due to high dig level, dig dose was reduced back down
to 0.125. Last dig level was 1.4. She was maintained on
lopressor for HR and BP control.  Ideally, digoxin can be
tapered off completely given narrow therapeutic range.
.
3) CHF:
Pt had total body fluid overload with b/l pleural effusions,
pericardial effusions.  She was gently diuresed with lasix.  An
echo was done which showed mild LVH with preserved EF.  There
was mild LVOT gradient.  Cozaar (which she took at home) was
restarted and can be titrate up as tolerated by BP.
.
4) CHRONIC LEG PAIN:
Continued on fentanyl patch.  Neurontin re-added to her regimen.
 This will need to be titrated up every few days as tolerated
until effect.  RTC tylenol added.  Avoid morphine or other IV
opioids which were likely contributing to nausea.
.
5) DM2:
Glipizide was held due to limited PO intake.  Pt was placed on
sliding scale insulin and insulin was added to TPN.  This should
continue.  Glipizide can be restarted when pt taking better POs.
.
6) CHRONIC DIARRHEA:
No clear etiology for this was found.  At [**Hospital6 **],
pt had abd Ct, colonoscopy, CTA which did not reveal etiology.
Infectious workup was negative.  Diarrhea was fairly minimal ie
once a day though at baseline occured 2-3 times a day.  Pt will
continue to have workup with outpt GI follow up but can use
lomotil for now.
.
7) ASTHMA:
At home, pt on chronic prednisone, singulair.  It was not clear
why pt was on chronic prednisone as this is not the ideal
management of asthma.  In the hospital, she was moving air well
and had no evidence of asthma exacerbation.  Therefore,
predisone was stopped, singulair continued, and given prn
bronchodilators.  If required, an inhaled steroid can be started
but at this point, not necessary.
.
8) ANEMIA:
Iron studies consistent with ACD though level of anemia and lack
of chronic inflammation made this unusual.  Her hct was variable
between 24-30 but did not require any transfusions.  Stools were
guiac negative and hemolysis labs were negative.
