Cystoscopy Operative Report:
Upon entering the bladder, there was quite a bit of hematuria
and
debris making a full evaluation and pan cystoscopy difficult.
There were no obvious filling defects in the bladder, but again
the bleeding thorough inspection impossible.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient's MICU course: In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 4901**] is a 81 y/o M 3
vessel CAD, Parkinson's disease, recurrent Klebsiella ESBL UTIs
admitted to MICU with hypertensive urgency. He was admitted with
BP 220/130 following cystoscopy performed for hematuria that was
too extensive to complete the procedure. He was also at the time
c/o of headache, CT head here was normal. He was given labetalol
10mg IV X2 followed by a labetalol gtt. Had trop leak and cards
was called for ECG had with TWI laterally. Cardiology was
consulted, felt likely strain pattern related to HTN. Urology
was consulted felt related to UTI/prostatitis per notes in OMR
and recommended treating.

Once on the floor,
#. Hypertensive emergency - BP better controlled now on floor,
ECG with no acute ischemic changes but strain pattern which may
have accounted for trop leak but down trending(CKs flat), not
likely having ACS. Started lisinopril for BP control. Can
continue to titrate up in creatinine is stable. In addition,
could try PO hydralazine. Beta blockers avoided because of AV
block. He was monitored on tele, continued on Imdur, statin,
aspirin, lasix 40mg PO qday.  The patient has been started on
Norvasc 5mg [**1-6**] to uptitrated as necessary. Please follow weekly
K/Cr for lisinopril adverse effects.

#. Hematuria - urology following, concern for ongoing UTI
causing hematuria, continued with condom catheter as he was not
retaining urine. Started Meropenem for Klebsiells UTI(ESBL)
500mg IV Q8 for 2 weeks ending [**2182-1-16**].  The patient has an
appointment scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].

#Chronic venous stasis changes. No current systemic signs of
infection. Continued lasix for LE edema.
