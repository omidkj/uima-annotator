bedtime, when he had one episode of BRBPR. He had no other
symptoms and attributed to his usual intermittent GI bleeding,
which he has had many episodes of over the past decade. He went
to bed, and awoke in the AM to find blood staining his pajamas.
Over the course of the morning, he continued to have small
amounts of BRBPR every 30-45 minutes, until about midday. At
that point, he began to feel lightheaded and presented to the
ED. Denies F/C, no N/V or hematemesis. No CP or SOB. No
abdominal pain.

standing, and BP trended down to 100s (initially 130s). Benign
abdominal exam. Passed BRBPR and clot from below in ED. HCT
noted to be 32.8 from most recent value of 36.4 in [**2191**]. GI was

IMAGING:
[**4-20**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. No previous tracing

.
[**4-21**] FLEX SIG:
Diverticulosis of the transverse colon, descending colon and
sigmoid colon
There was dark red blood clot coating along the mucosa of colon,
which precluded us from examining his colon mucosa.
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure and distal
transverse colon.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Acute blood loss anemia due to Diverticular lower GI bleed -
NG lavage was clear in ED, making an UGIB highly unlikely. Pt
was hemodynamically stable throughout his admission, and
required only 1 unit of pRBCs transfused at time of admission.
He underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed diverticulosis
(extensive) and no active bleeding. His HCTs were stable and he
was tolerating a regular diet at time of d/c. His BMs had
cleared to brown (from grossly bloody). He was given an Rx for
iron tabs, and his antihypertensives were held until PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**]. He was advised to use bowel/stool softeners and to
avoid constipation and straining during BMs.
.
#. HTN - held irbesartan and tamsulosin until PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**].
.
# BPH  - held tamsulosin until PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**]
.
# asthma - not active on this admission. Discharged with home
albuterol  and fluticasone (was previously on Azmacort which has
been discontinued).
.
# OSA - not acitve on this admission, no nocturnal desats. Did
not use CPAP.
.
# FEN: initially NPO, then advanced,well tolerated.
.
# CODE: DNR/I, discussed and confirmed with pt, he has form
filled out at home as well.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for
gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from your diverticulosis.  You
were monitored in a medical ICU and you received one transfusion
of blood.  You underwent sigmoidoscopy which showed blood but no
definite source of active bleeding. Your bloody bowel movements
improved on the 3rd day of your admission.  Your blood pressure
and heart rate improved.

Eating a high fiber diet and taking stool softeners as needed to
reduce straining are methods by which you can reduce your risk
for redeveloping bleeding.

Please note the following medication Changes:
- START: ferrous sulfate (iron) 325mg daily to help replace
blood loss
- START: docusate sodium 100mg twice daily as needed for stool
softening
- STOP: tamsulosin (for BPH, blood pressure) until you see your
PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]: irbesartan (for blood pressure) until you see your PCP
.
Please continue to take your other medications as before.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3510**] phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11962**], early next week. It is improtant for
you to be seen within the next 1 week.
.
You will need to be seen by a gastroenterologist for continued
followup of your diverticulosis. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3510**] can help to arrange
this.
