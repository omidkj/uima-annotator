81 yo man w/ho CAD, COP, PVD, AAA xfered from OSH for mngmt resp
failure.  Pt was found @ home by EMS followign c/o [**5-25**]
"crushing", nonradiating SSCP.  Pt diaphoretic during transport.
 Sat 84-->94% on NRB.  Given [**Month/Year (2) **], NT, nebs en route to OSH where
started on BIPAP and eventually intubated.  BP on arrival
240/140 so started on NTG drip titrated up until BP fell to
90/58 resulting in IVF, dopamine.  Given 80 IV lasix.  First set
enzymes negative and BNP 1700.  Pt xferred for further
management.
.
On arrival, pt intubated but responsive to y/n questions.
Indicated CP similar to what he had in past when he was cathed.
Started on hep gtt in ED.

PVD, AAA- 5 x 5 cm, PAF, CVA, COPD, depression, symptomatic
bradycardia (dig and B-B held during [**1-20**] admit w/ resolution of
brady)

Pertinent Results:
[**6-18**] Echo:
1. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably normal
(LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. There is a small pericardial effusion.
...
[**6-23**] PA/Lat CXR
Cardiomegaly, tortuous aorta, and improving CHF and atelectasis,

with persistent bilateral pleural effusion. Discrete nodular
opacities in
bilateral lungs, which are probably unchanged and represent
granulomas,
however, please repeat the PA and LAT study after CHF has been
resolved.
...
Renal artery US with doppler: No findings to suggest renal
artery stenosis. Echogenic kidneys consistent with the known
chronic parenchymal disease. If clinically [**Last Name (LF) 56542**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MR
could be performed.
...
[**1-17**] sputum Cx + for Hafnia Alvei; no other growth


Brief Hospital Course:
This 81 yo man w/ho CAD, COP, PVD, AAA was xfered from MVH for
mngmt resp failure.
.
Resp failure- Etiology likely volume overload [**2-17**] diastolic chf,
renal failure.  Pt was diuresed in the CCU then extubated and
subsequently oxygenated well and was called out to the stepdown
unit.  The patient initially failed diuresis with lasix alone,
then with lasix 100 IV / diuril 500.  Thus, despite lack of
systolic HF, nesiritide was used in the urgent situation of
hypoxic respiratory failure w/good diuresisi, allowing
extubation.  Following this, the patient did respond to lasix
100 IV w/500 diuril.  Following recommendation of renal
consultation, 60 PO lasix with 5 metolazone was attempted with
good results. No diuretics given after [**6-26**] and patient
continued to autodiurese about 1 L/day. Will d/c patient on PO
lasix, 20 mg /day. He was instructed to call his cariologist or
PCP if he gains >3 pounds to adjust doses of this medication.

Pt reports dry weight is about 200lbs (91kg).
.
CHF: The likely contributors to decompensated acute pulmonary
edema was acute HTN, diastolic HTN and renal dysfunction. BNP at
MVH was 7000 and pro-BNP was 17,700 here.  Stat echocardiography
performed on admission demonstrated no wall motion abnormalities
and good LV function.  The patient was diuresed as above.
.
HTN- CCB changed to clonidine.  Hydral/nitro were added for
afterload reduction.  Final regimen as listed under DC meds. Pt
developed chest pain while in the MRI suite when getting study
for transient aphasia. Recieved 2 SL nitro and SBP remained 145.
Pt was briefly transfered to neurology service on [**6-26**] for
further work up/evaluation of aphasia at which time all BP meds
were stopped. ON transfer back to cardiology service on [**6-28**]
patient was restarted on metoprolol 24mg [**Hospital1 **] which was increased
to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-29**]. He was d/c'ed on this dose. Imdur (30mg
daily) was added back on [**6-29**].
.
Neuro - ?CVA/TIA: Pt appreared to have TIA. Had acute episode of
confusion and aphasia. Completely resolved with no further
episodes. Neuro followed pt during admission, and he was
transfered to neurology service briefly for further eval and
treatment of transient aphasia. MRA with unchanged evidence of
small vessel dz but no acute infarct; evidence of TO of ICA but
there is reconstitution of the right anterior cerebral artery
and right middle cerebral artery branches from the left side via
anterior communicating artery - unchanged from prior exam. It
was thought that his transient aphagia was likely TIA [**2-17**]
cardioembolic event. He was restarted on coumadin and plavix was
discontinued.
Keep SBP 130-160. pt has been on coumadin in the past for h/o
Afib. wil lrestart coumadin [**6-28**] 10mg X2 nights followed by 5mg
QHS. cont heparin ggt until therapeutic at INR of [**2-18**]. His INR
was 2.6 on [**6-30**] and he was discharged on 5mg coumadin QHS. He is
to follow up with his PCP on [**Hospital3 4298**] for INR and
coumadin adjustments.

.
Ischemia- ?ACS, but no sig EKG changes and enzymes flat, no wall
motion abnormalities.  There was thus no ischemia.
.
ARF: On admission, creatinine bumped from baseline 1.5-2.0 to 4.
 FENa of .06 indicates effect intravascular depletion or renal
inability to excrete Na.  [**Month (only) 116**] be poor renal perfusion from being
off Starling Curve but this is less like as it did not improve
with diuresis.  24 hour urine demonstrated protein of [**Numeric Identifier 56543**] and
creatinine of 1444 demonstrated nephrotic range proteinuria.
Dopplers OK.  OP renal bx strongly suggested to patient, but he
refused as he does not wish this intense of a level of care.
.
The patient was full code throughout his stay.
.
Dispo: PT was consulted but reported that the patient has no PT
needs. He was dischareged with VNA services for BP control and
INR follow ups.
