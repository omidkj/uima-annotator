[**2186-11-26**] CXR
Borderline cardiac enlargement has decreased, comparable to the
preoperative appearance on [**10-23**]. Thickening of the right
costal and apical pleural margin is probably due to fat
deposition, not fluid, although a tiny volume of layering
pleural fluid is present bilaterally. No pneumothorax. No
pneumonia.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-11-21**] for elective
surgical management of his aortic stenosis. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement utilizing a 25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine valve.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was initially
slightly confused requiring a sitter however his mental status
slowly cleared. Later on postoperative day one, he was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
monitoring. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. Beta blockade was discontinued for low blood pressure.
The physical therapy service was consulted to help increase his
postoperative strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] developed
atrial fibrillation which converted spontaneously back into
normal sinus rhythm. Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative
day six. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
Beta blockade should be resumed as an outpatient when his blood
pressure can tolerate.
