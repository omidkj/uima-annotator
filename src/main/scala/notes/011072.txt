History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old man with a history of hypertension and
smoking who presented to an outside hospital this morning
complaining of severe headache and left sided weakness.  He is
currently intubated and sedated and the notes from the OH ER are
scant.  I spoke with the staff at his homeless shelter
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 67746**]) who say that he was well until this morning
around
6AM, when he was suddenly unable to move his left arm. They
immediately called EMS.  He was brought to the OH ED:  vitals
were HR 68 BP230/119 RR 18 O2Sat 100%.  Initial NIHSS=8 (left
limb weakness, ataxia, dysarthria).  Head CT at 6:15AM revealed
a
2.2x2.1 cm hyperdensity within the right basal ganglia.  Per the
ED notes, he was complaining of headache at 7:50AM and given 2mg
of dilaudid for pain.  Shortly thereafter, he became obtunded
and
was intubated for "neurologic deterioration".  During
intubation,
he received fentanyl, versed and succ.  Over his course, he
received an additional 10mg IV labetalol for elevated blood
pressure.  He was also given ativan 2mg x 7 (14mg total), versed
2mg x1 and dilantin 1g IV x1.  Prior to transfer, he was given a
dose of vecuronium (about 40minutes ago) and versed.

In our ED, he received another 4mg of Versed (trying to pull out
ETT with right hand).

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old with hx of HTN and smoking who presented to OSH with
left sided weakness and headache, found to have a large,
right-sided ICH centered in the thalamus.  His exam was limited
by sedation for much of his early stay, but he consistently had
little to no movement on his left side, but would follow
commands on the right.     The etiology of the bleed, given the
location, is likely to be poorly controlled hypertension.

1.Neuro:  The pt was admitted to the ICU and kept on close
neurochecks given the spread of his hemorrhage into all
ventricles and the concern that he may develop hydrocephalus.  A
CT scan here showed progression from the outside scan, and
despite normal coags, he was given Factor 7 as it was not known
whether his bleeding continued.  His BP was controlled
aggressively to keep his SBP<150.  He had serial CT scans which
showed stability.  Out of concern that he may develop
hydrocephalus given clotted blood in the 4th ventricle, an EVD
was placed and tpa was introduced into the ventricles.  This
resulted in clearance of blood from the 3rd and 4th ventricles.
His ICP remained in the 7-10 range with the drain and when
clamped, it stabilized out at ~14.  The drain was removed.  The
patient was kept sedated as he became very agitated when off
sedation and his BP would rise above goal ranges. When weaned,
he consistently followed commands on the right side but not the
left. His pupils were pinpoint and difficult to assess
throughout.

On transfer to the floor, the patient's alertness improved, as
did his attention to the left side of space and awareness of his
weakness. The patient requires further titration of his
captopril up - current dose is 37.5mg TID, for goal sbp<140.

2.ID: The patient was spiking fevers since admission and this
seemed to worsen over time, with spikes to the 103 range at
times.  His WBC ct went to 14, but then resolved over several
days on antibiotics.  Multiple sets of blood cultures were
negative.  Multiple UAs and urine cultures were also negative.
He had a sputum sent which grew haemophilus and strep
pneumoniae.  He also had a CXR which showed LLL hazy opacity.
He was put on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl.  This was
narrowed to levofloxacin when the sensitivities returned.  He
continued to be intermittently febrile.  CSF was sent from his
ventricular drain which had a negative GS and 300 WBCs(but with
200K RBCs, so the ratio is appropriate for normal blood).
However, as the fevers continued, he was expanded back to
vancomycin and ceftazidime.  He has evidence of sinus disease on
multiple CTs.  ENT looked at the scan and did not feel that this
could account for his fevers.  ID was consulted and suggested
repeating the CSF analysis.  This was done and showed
meningitis; fevers resolved on antibiotics and the external
ventricular drain was removed. He requires further antibiotic
treatment until [**7-20**].

3.CV: As above, he had significant hypertension with agitation.
He was started o
