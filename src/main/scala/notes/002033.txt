Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hickman placement ([**2110-6-13**]) - right sublcavian; double tunneled
hickman line with c-arm.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 70 year-old male with striatonigral degeneration,
history of multiple admissions for hypoxia and respiratory
failure who presents with fever.

Patient was recently admitted in [**Month (only) **], ([**Date range (1) 16592**]) when he
was admitted with hypoxia/respiratory failure. He was found to
have a pseudomonal PNA and acute exacerbation of hypoxia at that
time was thought to be secondary to thick secretions. He was
treated with zosyn x 14 days, vancomycin x 10 days. Initially,
the patient required ventilatory support due to hypercarbia but
was able to be weaned to trach mask by the end of the second
week. Additionally, fluid overload played a component in this.
Other things complicating admission were hypernatremia and
metabolic alkalosis requiring diamox. Pt was d/cd home on
[**2110-5-19**].

Per wife, pt left on the day of discharge at 4 pm. He arrived
home and by 8 pm he was spiking a temperature. He has had fevers
since then, more noticable in the AM, with the highest morning
of admission to 102.5. Because of his continued fevers, and
culture sputum results (one of three colonies of pseudomonas
came back sensitive to tobra but not to zosyn), a PICC was
placed by IR on [**2110-5-22**] as an outpt and he was started on
tobramycin IV (360 mg IV q24 hr). He was also started on flagyl
PO for diarrhea that resolved.
+fatigue; + increased grey secretions this week per wife. Today,
PICC line was clogged, the patient was still febrile, and sent
to ED per PCP.

In the ED, VS on arrival were: T: 100.5; HR: 97; BP: 114/75; RR:
20: 98 on 3L trach mask. He was given flagyl 500 mg IV and
levaquin 500 mg IV

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 70 year old male with striatonigral degeneration,
multiple hospital admission for hypoxia and respiratory failure
who was recently d/cd on [**2110-5-19**] with a pseudomonal pneumonia
who presented with fevers and sputum cultures that grew
pseudomonas and later MRSA and with stool positive for c. diff.
Required ventilatory support for much of hospital stay, but
currently on trach mask, afebrile for many days and improved.

1. Fever:  [**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to tracheobronchitis/PNA
(grew pseudomonas on sputum cultures from [**5-28**], [**5-29**], [**5-31**] and
[**6-4**]; grew MRSA on sputum cultures from [**5-28**], [**5-29**], [**5-31**], [**6-8**];
grew enterobacter on sputum from [**6-4**]).  Was c. diff positive at
presentation.  Both blood and urine cultures were negative
throughout stay.  The pulmonary infection was treated with
tobramycin, meropenum and vancomycin; the c. diff was treated
with flagyl.  The patient remained afebrile from [**6-10**] until
discharge.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Was placed on vent on [**5-28**] as
ABG showed 7.28/104/63.  During this time, the patient produced
copious secretions.  Initial attempts at weaning were
unsuccessfull as the patient would experience apneic episodes on
pressure support ventilation.  Therefore, he emained on vent
until [**6-10**], at which time trials of trach mask were successfully
attempted during the day time.  From [**6-13**] until discharge, did
well back on trach mask.  A VBG done on [**6-16**] which showed:
7.40/70/40.

3. Seizure:  Patient had seizure like activiy on [**5-28**] (leg
twitching, face twitching) which lasted for 15-30 seconds and
resolved spontaneously.  There was no bladder or bowel
incontinence noted (pt. had foley in place).  Ativan, 1 mg was
given just after event ended.  The patient was seen by neurology
who thought it may have been due to toxic metabolic, structural,
or hypoxia.  An EEG showed encephalopathy.  No further seizure
activity was noted during hospital stay.

4.  Anemia:  Presented with a Hct of 28.8 from a highly variable
baseline (25-35). Was guiac (-) on [**5-31**]. Iron studies of 9/95
showed low iron and TIBC, c/w anemia of chronic disease.  On
[**6-11**], Hct was 19.8 for which he recieved one unit of pRBCs.  No
other blood products were needed and the patient's Hct at
discharge was 26.8.

5. Abdominal distention: Noted on [**6-2**].  NG was placed and
bilious secretions were noted.  G-tube was noted to be clogged,
so this was re-opened using solution of pancrease and
bicarbonate.  Over time, the disention diminished and the NG was
removed.  At discharge, some distention remained, although less
than had been noted initially.

6. Right hip fracture:  A KUB on [**6-3**] showed a chronic fracture
of the right femoral neck.  Hip films confirmed this.  The
patient's wife noted that this was an old fracture and she chose
to not work it up any further.

7. Striatonigral degneration: Stable during stay.  We continued
outpatient medications (Sinemet and Ritalin)

8. Hypothyroid: Stable during stay.  We continued outpatient
levoxyl.

9. GERD: Stable during stay.  We continued outpatient PPI.

10. FEN:
Fluids: Initially treated with 1/2 NS, which was later
discontinued.  For intial hypernatremia, recieved free water
boluses.  Later in stay, patient was total body overloaded;
lasix (20 mg I
