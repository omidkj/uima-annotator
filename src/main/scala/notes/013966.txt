History of Present Illness:
50 M with h/o MVP, who presented [**7-29**] after 2-3d fever (Tm 103),
malaise. On the morning of admission pt's wife noted increased
confusion, and thus brought pt to ED.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **] pt was initially A&Ox3, but intermittently found to
be confused, though otherwise neurologically intact per notes.
CT HEAD was obtained which revealed left frontal SAH with
multiple foci of ?hemmorhage vs emboli. labs revealed platelets
77, WBC 7.9, Na was 126 with K of 3.1.
.
pt received 4 units of platelets [**3-8**] SAH, and was loaded with
phenytoin 1g. ID and neurosurgical consult were obtained. for
fever, ddx was broad given mental status changes (bacterial,
meningitis, parasitic, lyme, RMSF, HSV etc..), pt started on
vanco, doxycycline, CTX, acyclovir for concern of bacterial
infection vs lyme disease, though he remained febrile to 101
despite tylenol and cooling blankets.
.
Blood cultures on [**7-29**] subsequently grew [**Month/Year (2) 8974**], raising concern
for septic emboli. Given his h/o MVP, pt underwent TTE and TEE
which were negative for vegetation, but did reveal new flail
mitral valve. Cardiothoracic surgery consulted [**7-31**], with plan
for likely outpt valve replacement.
.
pt underwent MRI [**7-29**] to further evaluate multiple foci of
hemmorhage in head and for concern of mycotic aneurysm, however
shortly after study developed respiratory distress, ultimately
requiring intubation [**7-30**]. This was subsequently felt most
likely [**3-8**] aggressive IVF hydration during initial ED
presentation (8L IVF per notes). Pt was diuresed, and quickly
weaned from vent on [**7-31**]. Cerebral angiogram performed on [**8-2**]
which was limited by motion, but unremarkable.
.
On [**2193-8-5**] he had a cerebral angiogram under general anesthesia.
The procedure was complicated by hypotension while intubated,
for which he was on neo transiently. He received 1600ml of LR
during the case. He was extubated, but in the PACU developed
respiratory distress with oxygen sats in the 80's and
reintubated. He again had hypotension (while on propofol) to the
80s and was bolused LR and restarted on Neo (at 1-0.75mcg/kg) to
maintain an SBP of 90-100's. Pt transferred to MICU.
.
Patient was extubated in the MICU (neg 3.2L) and breathing on
room air prior to transfer back to the floor. Noted to have
temperature spike to 102.3. Repeat echocardiogram was done and
no change was noted. Patient was sent to abdominal CT for
further work-up of fever, which demonstrated ? splenic abscess
(final read pending).
.
Pt triggered at 2:47 am for BP 180/91, HR 140s in setting of
fever to 102.3. RR 24, satting 97% 2L. Pt given tylenol 350 mgx1
and 1 L NS. Pt defervesced and HR returned to 90s. Pt reported
some shortness of breath. EKG: ST 120s, no st-t changes. Given
concern for flash pulmonary edema in setting of
fluid/compromised hemodynamics, o/n attg recommended transfer to
MICU service for further monitoring.

IMAGING:
[**2193-8-6**]: TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic  function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There
is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (posterior leaflet and its
supporting structures are markedly thickened). The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral valve leaflets are
elongated. There is moderate/severe posterior mitral leaflet
prolapse. There is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail. An
eccentric jet of (at least) moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen; the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
underestimated secondary to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant flow (Coanda effect). No vegetation/mass is seen on
the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-7-31**], the findings are similar.

[**2193-8-5**]: REPEAT CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM under general anesthesia
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous
malformation, or other cause for subarachnoid hemorrhage. On
delayed images from the bilateral external carotid injections,
there are small foci of patchy blush of the bilateral posterior
parietal scalp which is nonspecific but likely venous filling.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation,
or other cause for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

[**2193-8-2**] CEREBRAL angiogram:
Severely limited exam due to patient motion, but no gross
aneurysms or vascular malformations are identified. A repeat
angiogram with anesthesia may be considered if clinically
warranted.
.
[**2193-8-1**] TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No ASD or PFO are seen (saline contrast at rest
given). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The
mitral
