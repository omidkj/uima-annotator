HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a
71-year-old gentleman referred by his cardiologist for a
cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 2018**] due to complaints of lower chest burning for the past
eight months that has woken him up from sleep.  He had a
recent GI workup which was negative and the pain did not
resolve with a trial of proton pump inhibitors.  His exercise
treadmill test was significant for inferolateral ST changes
and reversible inferolateral defect on imaging.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Tobacco 55 pack year, current smoker.
2.  Osteoarthritis.
3.  GERD.
4.  Multiple hand surgeries for finger contractures.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Celebrex 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Nitroglycerin p.r.n.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on [**2120-11-1**].  Cardiac
catheterization at that time showed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 35-40%, 80% distal left main coronary
artery disease, 50% left circumflex, 60% OM1 and 90% OM2
lesions and a 90% mid RCA lesion.

The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for operative
consideration.  It was decided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], due to the
patient's severe coronary artery disease, that the patient
would be taken to the Operating Room that same day.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a
CABG times four with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1, SVG to OM2, and
SVG to RCA.  The total bypass time was 87 minutes, cross
clamp time was 72 minutes.  Transesophageal echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 40% with mildly depressed LV
systolic function, improved postoperatively in light of
inotropes.  Normal RV systolic function, trace MR, no AI, and
the aorta was intact.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  Shortly after arriving to the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient became profoundly hypotensive and was
unable to sustain an adequate blood pressure in spite of
being given boluses of fluid and calcium.  The patient
subsequently became pulseless and was administered boluses of
epinephrine, bicarbonate, and fluids.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was at the
bedside.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed
which showed cardiac standstill.  The chest was opened at the
bedside and internal cardiac massage was begun.  The
patient's rhythm during this time deteriorated into
ventricular fibrillation and was not responsive to internal
defibrillation.

During open cardiac massage it was noted that there was no
blood in the chest cavity when it was initially opened.
There subsequently was a large amount of dark blood coming
from the region of the right atrium from a presumed tear.
The patient was taken emergently back to the Operating Room
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**], and placed back on bypass.
The tear in the right atrium was repaired and the patient was
resuscitated.  The patient was weaned from bypass with the
assistance of an intra-aortic balloon pump, low-dose
inotropic support, and the patient was separated from bypass
without difficulty.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition where he remained on low-dose
