Discharge Instructions:
The operation you have experienced is a "scraping" operation;
that is to say, the bladder tumor or biopsy sample was "scraped"
off the bladder wall. Bleeding was controlled with
electrocautery which will produce a "scab" in the inside bladder
wall. About 1-2 weeks after the operation, pieces of the scab
will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs,
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. Because of this
tendency for bleeding, aspirin and Advil must be avoided for 2
weeks following your operation, but Tylenol is okay. If bleeding
occurs and persists for more than 12 hours or if clots impair or
block your stream, call your urologist. If the stream is
completely blocked and you cannot contact your urologist, go to
the ER for Foley flushing.

If you develop a fever over 101?????? or chills, call your urologist.
Although not common, this may indicate infection that has
developed beyond the control of the antibiotics that you have
taken.

It will take 6 weeks from the date of surgery to fully recover
from your operation. This can be divided into two parts -- the
first 2 weeks and the last 4 weeks. During the first 2 weeks
from the date of your surgery, it is important to be "a person
of leisure". You should avoid lifting and straining, which also
means that you should avoid constipation. This can be done by in
3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use stool softeners (Colace and
Senna) which have been prescribed for you, and 3) use gentle
laxatives such as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased at
your local drug store. It is important for you to avoid
prolonged sitting. You should avoid sexual activity during this
time. Also, avoid driving. The danger is not so much the
driving, but it may delay you from urinating if you have the
urge; and, "holding" urine may cause bleeding. If you return to
work before 2 weeks, you may feel fatigued and require a
decreased work load.

During the second 4 week period of your recovery, you may begin
regular activity, but only on a graduated basis. For example,
you may feel well enough to return to work, but you may find it
easier to begin on a half-day basis. It is common to become
quite tired in the afternoon, and if such occurs, it is best to
take a nap! Also, you may begin to drive as well as lift objects
such as a briefcase, etc. If you are a golfer, you may begin to
swing a golf club at this time. Sexual activity may be resumed
during this time, but only on a limited basis. In general, your
overall activity may be escalated to normal as you progress
through this second time period, such that by 6-8 weeks
following the date of surgery, you should be back to normal
activity. If you take aspirin as a regular medication, it may be
resumed at this time.

Finally, call your urologist in one week after your surgery for
the results of your biopsy and your next appointment.

You have significant lung disease and emphysema which
contributed to the difficulty extubating you after your surgery.
 You are being discharged with prescriptions for inhalers which
you should use as directed to help treat your lungs.  Please
also talk with your primary care doctor about a referral to a
pulmonologist.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in [**1-22**] weeks. Call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 5727**] for an appointment as soon as you get home.

You have an appointment to follow up with an endocrinologist for
your thyroid.  Please make every effort to attend this
appointment: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 251**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16624**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1803**]

You have an appointment to follow up with your primary care
doctor.  Please talk with your doctor about seeing a
pulmonologist for your lungs.  There is evidence of signficiant
emphysema on your Cat Scan which likely contributed to the
difficulty removing the ventillator after your surgery and the
need for reintubation.
