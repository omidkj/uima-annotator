Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Cholangitis/Pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year-old congenitally deaf, Russian sign only Male
with a history of systolic dysfunction, DM II, HTN, who
presented initially in the ED with pancreatitis [**12-21**] CBD stone
s/p ERCP.

Via translator pt stated he started experiencing a constant
[**2124-5-25**] sharp pain in his RLQ yesterday afternoon after eating
dinner, pain did not improve which was why he came into the ED.
Since the pain started he has had no appetite. He also
experienced an episode of emesis, non-bloody yesterday. He
denies any fevers, chills, changes in bowel movements, melena,
hematochezia, hematemesis, chest pain, difficulty breathing.

In the ED, had BP 115-140/70-92, HR 100-116, RR 16-20, Sat
96-100%. He underwent a CT abd which showed a small CBD stone
with some inflammation of the pancreas head. Labs were also
notable for Lipase of 2650, AST/ALT 413/402, Alk Phos 203. An
EKG obtained in the ED was also notable for ST depressions with
T wave incersions, cardiology was consulted and assessed pt
having likely demand ischemia from his infectious state. Pt was
started on Zosyn for cholangitis broad coverage as well as 2L
NS. Pt underwent ERCP which resulted in visualization of two
irregular stones in the common bile duct, one in the ampulla and
one in the common hepatic duct with mild dilation of the biliary
tree. Pt noted to be hypotensive with a SBP in the 70s following
induction and during procedure was started Neosenephrine and
transferred back to ICU still intubated.

Imaging:
CXR: No evidence of free air. Stable appearance of the right
proximal
humerus osteochondroma.

CT ABD and PELVIS w/o Contrast:
1. Marked peripancreatic inflammatory stranding, most consistent
with acute pancreatitis. Evaluation for complications related to
acute pancreatitis is limited without intravenous contrast.
Presumably, given the presence of multiple small gallstones, and
likely stone in the region of the distal CBD,these findings
represent gallstone pancreatitis.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Bilateral incompletely characterized hyperdense renal cysts.
Followup
renal ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.

ERCP:
Bulging of the major papilla, due to impacted stone. Two
irregular stones in the common bile duct ( one impacted in the
ampulla) and common hepatic duct. Mild dilation of the biliary
tree.  Successful sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Successful extraction of  two stones and sludge successfully
using a 9 mm balloon. Infected black bile was seen draining from
the bile duct.

CT ABDOMEN [**2122-12-26**]:
FINDINGS: There is atelectasis and/or consolidation at both
bases, with
bilateral small pleural effusions, left worse than right.
There is extensive stranding surrounding the pancreas, with
stranding also
throughout the retroperitoneum, in keeping with pancreatitis.
Overall, the
extent of inflammation is unchanged. Please note that the lack
of intravenous contrast limits the evaluation for pancreatic
necrosis. Within the common bile duct as well as the cystic
duct, there is hyperattenuating material. There is also
hyperattenuating material layering within the gallbladder. The
density of the material within the gallbladder appears somewhat
higher when compared with the gallstones seen on the recent
examination. Therefore, while some of this material may
represent gallstones, contrast material retained within the
gallbladder lumen is a possibility. Likewise, the
hyperattenuating material within the common bile duct and within
the cystic duct may also represent small stones vs. small amount
of refluxed contrast. There is no evidence of common bile duct
dilatation.
The stomach is somewhat distended, and there is reflux of oral
contrast into the esophagus. However, there is no evidence of
bowel obstruction. Oral contrast passes to at least the distal
ascending colon. Small bowel loops are normal in caliber
throughout. Note is made of mild wall thickening of the
ascending colon distally. The transverse colon and descending
colon demonstrate no evidence of wall thickening. The findings
in the right colon may be secondary to the
pancreatic/retroperitoneal inflammation. Alternatively, it may
reflect edema. It should be noted that there is evidence of
diffuse subcutaneous edema as well as a small amount of ascites.
Less likely, the findings could represent a focal infectious or
inflammatory process.
Allowing for lack of intravenous contrast administration, there
is no gross contour abnormality associated with the liver,
spleen, adrenals, or kidneys. There is no abdominal
lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
PELVIS: There is trace free fluid within the pelvis. The bladder
is
decompressed by a Foley catheter.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent inflammatory changes consistent with pancreatitis.
Please note that non-contrast technique precludes the evaluation
for pancreatic necrosis. Overall, the extent of inflammatory
change is stable.
2. Hyperdensity within a non-dilated common bile duct extending
over a fairly long segment. Differential considerations include
small stones vs. refluxed oral contrast, vs. retained contrast
material from the patients ERCP.

ECHO [**2122-12-28**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no per
