History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yo woman COPD on home O2, currently
admitted to MICU with SOB. She was at baseline at her [**Hospital 4382**] facility until approximately one week ago. Baseline
consists of 2L O2 at rest and 4L with exertion, able to walk
across the room without SOB but mild dyspnea with further
exertion, no chronic cough. For the past week she has noticed
new mildly productive cough and progressive SOB with exertion
around the room. Of note, she ran out of her tiotropium inhaler
3 days prior to admission. On the day of admisison, patient was
found by the nurse at her [**Hospital3 **] facility to be Her VNA
found her to be hypoxic to 70s on RA. She was given 2 nebs
without significant improvement, so EMS was activated.
.
In the ED, initial VS BP 106/66, HR 94, RR 36, O2 Sat 96% on
NRB.
She received albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, azithromycin 500
mg, and solumedrol 125 mg for presumed COPD exacerbation. CXR
demonstrated R-sided multilobar pneumonia; thus, 1g ceftriaxone
and 1g vancomycin were administered. After a total 5 combination
nebulizers followed by albuterol nebulizers every 15 minutes,
she remained quite tachypneic and uncomfortable, with RR >30 and
NRB O2 requirement. She was admitted to the MICU for further
managment.
VS prior to transfer: HR 97, RR 32, BP 101/54, 97% on NRB
.


Past Medical History:
1. COPD
2. Stab wound in [**2187**] leading to splenectomy and partial
pancreatectomy.
3. Esophageal reflux.
4. Intracerebral hemorrhage as a consequence of a hypertensive
crises, needing craniotomy and a ventricular peritoneal shunt in

the craniotomy. She has a ventricular peritoneal shunt in place.

5. Left hip replacement.
6. Hypertension
7. Longstanding lower extremity swelling.
8. Partial R upper lobe collapse noted in [**2191-4-27**],
confirmed by CT. PET was negative for any sign of malignancy. A
subsequent chest x-ray showed improvement.


Social History:
She currently lives in [**Hospital3 **] and is not working. She
quit smoking 15 years ago and had a roughly 40 pack year
history. She denies any known exposure to asbestos or relevant
toxic dust or fumes.
.


Family History:
No lung disease. Her mother had a stroke.

aeration.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 67 yo woman with a history of very severe COPD on home O2
presents with pneumonia and COPD exacerbation requiring MICU
admission.
.
#Respiratory failure: Pt had multifactorial hypoxia, secondary
to pneumonia, very severe COPD, and, after resuscitation, volume
overload.  She was intubated after several hours in the ICU for
primarily hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She was treated with
Vancomycin, Cefepime, Azithromycin for hospital acquired
pneumonia and atypical pathogens.  She was intubated shortly
after admission.  She required pressors to maintain MAP > 65 in
the setting of intubation, was weaned from pressors by the
following morning.  She completed an 8 day course of
antibiotics, continued on methylprednisolone q8h and standing
nebs which were tapered off during her ICU stay.  She also
required 15L IVF resucitation on admission and became volume
overloaded, contributing to her requirement of ventilatory
support, requiring aggressive diuresis prior to extubation.  She
was difficult to wean from the ventilator and finally extubated
to bipap on hospital day 13.  She was then transferred to the
floor where remained clinically stable.  Oxygen requirement
improved to baseline of 2L and she was discharged to rehab on
nebulizers.
.
# h/o hypertension: Antihypertensives were held initially when
requiring pressor. After extubation syhe was restarted on her
amlodpine.  Captopril was discontinued.  IF she becomes
hypertensive at rehab, would consider starting a low dose ACEI.
.
