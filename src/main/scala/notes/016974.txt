Placement of a midline IV


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 27 yo female with MMP incl asthma, fibromyalgia and
tobacco abuse here with complaint of difficulty breathing and
wheezing for last 3 days.  Has been having similar problems for
the last few months, but more acute now. Pt states that she had
fevers upto 101.4 and chills at home.  Generalized weakness, and
myalgias as well.  Pt admits to a cough, but hasn't been able to
cough up anything.  Denies any sick contacts.  Denies nasal
congestion or sore throat. Was recently treated for a UTI with
7d course of Cipro. Pt also complains of chest pain in the
epigarstic area, no radiation, worse with deep inspiration and
certain movements. Took her inhalers/nebs and 40 mg of
Prednisone yesterday, with no improvement of symptoms.
.
Of note, pt went to see her PCP yesterday, and had a CT chest
that showed bilateral opacities.  She was told to come to the ED
in the setting of increased SOB. Pt was noted to have
lymphadenopathy in the past, and is being worked up for
sarcoidosis.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.8 P 111 BP 146/88 R 20 O2 sat
95% on RA. Patient's O2 sats went down to 88% on RA.  She
received nebs, but was still hypoxic, eventually requiring NRB.
Pt also received 2L NS for IVF and Solumedrol 125mg IV,
Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone.
.
She was then transferred to the ICU.
.

Imaging:
[**2196-10-6**] Chest CT: New widespread areas of ground-glass opacities
in both lungs involving all lobes with no central or peripheral
predisposition as well as with no apical basal gradient with
slightly more of the abnormality seen within the upper lungs.
The differential diagnosis might include infectious process such
as viral pneumonia or mycoplasma. Less likely , hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia , vasculitis or COP may be
also suggested. Clinical correlation is recommended.

[**2196-10-7**] CXR: The CT scan of one day prior demonstrates scattered
areas of
ground-glass opacity throughout both lungs, predominantly in the
apices. The current x-ray study, though limited as above,
demonstrates increased density in the left perihilar and lower
lung regions. It is unlikely that the process noted on the CT
has resolved; however, some of the opacity in the left lung that
is now visualized may be due to atelectasis. If clinically
feasible, consider PA and lateral view for more sensitive
evaluation. However, there is likely underlying evolving
infection as detailed in the chest CT report.

[**2196-10-9**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stable. The
patient is in mild volume overload. There is still no focal
consolidation demonstrated with the focal areas of ground-glass
opacities seen on prior chest CT from [**2197-1-5**] can be
seen in the left upper lung and as previously mentioned might
represent infectious process.


Brief Hospital Course:
27 yo female with MMP incl asthma, fibromyalgia and tobacco
abuse admitted to ICU for hypoxia/respiratory distress.

# Respiratory distress/hypoxia: On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
patient was satting at 97%-100% on NRB.  Patient reports this
episode felt different from her usual asthma exacerbation as she
felt much worse this time. The differential diagnoses included
CAP pneumonia / atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, influenza
complicated by asthma exacerbation.  PE, ACS, CHF on
differential but unlikely.  Eosinophilic PNA less likely as no
peripheral eosinophila, no other signs of vasculitis at this
time (ESR and CRP only mildly elevated).  Per patient's PCP
patient has long reported excessive mold in her building which
could be significant given ddx includes hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. Patient was put on Levoquin for possible CAP vs
atypical pna. CXR showed no consolidations or clear infiltrate;
together with her clinical exam of severe wheezing, this was
most consistent with viral pneumonia complicated by asthma
exacerbation despite her negative viral cultures.  Patient was
put on Advair, Flovent, Xopenex. In addition, solumedrol and
singulair were started. Patient was initially put on high flow
aerosol mask, which was slowly weaned to nasal cannula. On the
day of transfer to floor, patient walked 3 laps on ICU floor on
room air with oxygen saturation of around 93%. While on the
floor she remained stable, with improvement in her tachycardia.

# Chest pain: Differential included pneumonia, asthma
exacerbation and chest tightness, PE, GERD, anxiety or ACS.  EKG
showed no acute changes. Patient had very low risk for CAD.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 2. Outpatient percocet was
continued.

# Fibromyalgia: Patient complained of bilateral leg pain on
admission. Home Percocet q4-6h PRN was continued for pain. Home
dose Lyrica was continued as well.

# Depression: Stable. Home Cymbalta and Valium were continued.

# GERD/gasteoperesis: Home dose pantoprazole and ranitidine were
continued.

# Vit D def: Home dose calcium and vitD supplementation were
continued.

FEN: regular diet
Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen
