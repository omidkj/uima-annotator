Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9454**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, fevers, hypoxia, hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Briefly this is a 41 y.o. Male with h.o. OSA on BiPAP, HTN, and
asthma who initially presented with 3 day h.o. increased SOB,
diaphoresis, fevers. Transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and
hemoptysis with Hct drop.
.
Day prior to admission noted a cough productive of clear phlegm.
He also noted some watery [**First Name3 (LF) **] with cough. Per prior H&P he had
similar episode 7 years ago after shooting cocaine. He denies
any recent drug use. On admission he was noted to have a
leukocytosis of 16.3. CXR showed no PNA however no retrocardiac
opacity was able to be ruled out per medicine team. He was sent
for influenza swabs which were negative. He also was started on
Levofloxacin for presumed CAP.
.
On review of OMR it appears his nasal swab for viral was
negative, [**First Name3 (LF) **] cultures x 2 were negative and pending. A sputum
culture was attempted but was unfortunately contaminated. Since
admission pt has been saturating in the mid 90s on 3L n.c.,
subsequently pt triggered for hemoptysis and hypoxia. He had an
episode of hemoptysis x 1 and desaturated to the low 80s. He was
transitioned to shovel mask 10L and his saturation improved to
the low 90s even with continuous nebulizers. Pt underwent ABG
which showed pH 7.43, pH2 60, pCO2 42. CTA was also obtained
which was notable for pneumonia versus hemorrhage.
.
Pt was transferred to ICU for closer monitoring and
consideration for possible Non-invasive versus intubation for
possible bronchoscopy. He is subsequently being transferred to
the floor on [**2-5**] L NC, with saturations in the mid to high 90s,
on levofloxacin.

Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
[**2167-9-13**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2167-9-12**].
Heart is enlarged. Mediastinum within normal limits. There is
interval development of prominence with central pulmonary
vasculature consistent with mild congestive failure. Left lung
base omitted from the study.
.
[**2167-9-12**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe atelectasis, similar to the previous
chest CT
.
[**2167-9-11**]: CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Very limited study. No pulmonary embolism in the main
pulmonary arteries.
2. Left lower lobe collapse.
3. Likely mild atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
4. Mild right hilar adenopathy.
.
[**2167-9-10**] CXR PA/lateral:
IMPRESSION: Opacity in the left retrocardiac region obscuring
the left
hemidiaphragm, could represent atelectasis or early infection.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 y.o. male w/ OSA on CPAP, HTN, Asthma p/w fevers, SOB,
hemoptysis, transferred to ICU for hypoxia, lobar consolidation,
now being transferred to medical floor.
.
##. Hypoxia: likely from CAP in setting of obesity
hypoventilation syndrome and reactive airway
disease/bronchospasm given physical exam and imaging. CXR
showing, "opacity in the left retrocardiac region obscuring the
left hemidiaphragm, could represent atelectasis or early
infection." These factors likely led to shunt, A-a gradient, and
hypoxia. CTA chest without PE.  Initially transfererd to MICU,
requiring shovel mask 10L and continuous nebulizers,
subsequently weaned to 4-5L oxygen by NC in the MICU, then over
the course of two days, oxygenating well with minimal oxygen
support.  Patient was started on levofloxacin for CAP on
admission, and will complete an 8 day regimen on discharge.  He
was also continued on albuterol nebulizers as needed.  He was
provided incentive spirometry, which he will continue on
discharge.  Patient continued CPAP at night, per home settings.
He was > 92% on RA when ambulatory, prior to discharge.
.
##. Hemoptysis: small volume (1 teaspoon) hemoptyis, which had
resolved by discharge. Hematocrit and upper airway were stable
throughout hospitalization. Suspect source to be from pulmonary
circulation/pneumonia. CTA neg for PE or tumor burden. PPD was
negative. Patient was started on scheduled benzonatate, which he
can take as needed on discharge.
.
##. Acute Kidney Injury: resolved. Pt's creatinine on admission
elevated at 1.5 but trended down and 1.1 on discharge. Suspect
pre-renal causes due to increased insensible losses from fever
and poor PO intake during shortness of breath/pneumonia.
.
##. HTN: continued on home regimen of Clonidine. [**Month/Day/Year **] pressures
were slightly elevated on this admission (consistently recorded
as 160s/100s, manual 150s/90s). This was communicated with the
patient and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is to discuss the possibility of adding a
new [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pressure [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with his PCP at the [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] visit.
.
##. Microcytic anemia: patient with mild anemia, without
evidence of bleeding to explain degree of anemia. Work-up with
iron studies suggested a component of anemia of chronic disease
as well as iron deficiency. Results and implications were
communicated with patient and primary care doctor. Patient may
require iron supplementation, early colonoscopy, and/or
hemoglobinopathy work-up.
.
##. PSYCH: pt with h.o. bipolar d.o., depression. Continued on
home regimen of Citalopram and Buproprion. Home trazodone was
resumed when hypoxia improved.
.
##. OSA: continued on home CPAP regimen

Medications on Admission:
Atenolol 150 mg daily
Bupropion 75 mg [**Hospital1 **]
Citalopram 10 mg daily
Clonidine 0.1
