Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old man
with a past medical history as noted below, who presented to
the Emergency Department with complaints of several weeks of
progressive weakness and fatigue.  On the morning of
admission, the patient states that he developed mild "slow
vertigo" that was worse when sitting up.  The patient states
that he had a similar episode one month prior to admission
that was attributed to dehydration from diarrhea; the patient
was hospitalized from [**3-18**] through [**2146-3-22**] for
this problem.  [**Name (NI) **] has also noted slurred speech for about
three weeks prior to admission, which his family attributes
to cyclobenzaprine and Percocet use.

He otherwise, denied fever, chills, headache, tinnitus,
hearing loss, visual changes, chest pain, shortness of
breath, or sensory loss.  In the Emergency Department, the
patient received hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, 1 gram of
Vancomycin IV, ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and 2 liters of normal
saline IV.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 100 pack year smoking
history, but he quit smoking cigarettes five years prior to
admission.  He denies any history of alcohol abuse.  He
worked in the Navy, which is where he had asbestos exposure.
He walks with assistance at home, and he is on 2 liters of
oxygen by nasal cannula at home.  His daughter is actively
involved in his medical care.

FAMILY HISTORY:  [**Name (NI) **] mother died of bone cancer.  His
father died of lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the
patient's temperature was 96.6, heart rate 80, blood pressure
96/56, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation 100% on 1.5
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.  The patient was a thin,
elderly, cachectic gentleman in no acute distress.  His
sclerae were clear bilaterally, pupils were 4 mm and equally
reactive to light bilaterally, his oropharynx was dry, and he
had no jugular venous distention.  He had no wheezes, he had
empty breath sounds over the right upper lung fields, and had
bibasilar crackles.  He had no rhonchi.  His heart was a
regular, rate, and rhythm, there were normal S1, S2 heart
sounds.  There was a 1-2/6 early systolic ejection murmur
heard best at the right upper sternal border, no S3, S4 heart
sounds, and evidence of a prior CABG scar.  His abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended, there were normoactive bowel
sounds.  He had no hepatosplenomegaly.  There was no rebound
or guarding, and he had a lower abdominal scar.  There was no
lower extremity edema.  He had palpable dorsalis pedal pulses
bilaterally, and evidence of chronic rheumatoid arthritis
deformations of his hands bilaterally.  He was alert and
oriented times three, had occasional slurred speech, cranial
nerves II through XII were intact, strength was [**5-2**]
throughout, he had no focal sensory deficits, and his deep
tendon reflexes were 1+ throughout.

On initial laboratory evaluation, the patient's white count
was 8.6 (with a differential of 83% neutrophils, 2% bands, 5%
lymphocytes, and 9% monocytes), hematocrit of 29.9, and
platelets of 203,000.  Initial serum chemistries demonstrated
a sodium of 130, potassium 5.5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 18,
BUN 61, creatinine 2.3 (baseline creatinine is 1.3-1.5), and
glucose of 108, his calcium is 8.8, magnesium 2.3, and
phosphate 4.3.  His INR was 1.1 and his PTT was 24.3, ALT was
8, AST 24, amylase 33, total bilirubin 0.4, and his albumin
was 3.2.  His initial urinalysis demonstrated a specific
gravity of 1.020 and was otherwise negative.  Of note, the
patient's initial CK was 60, but his initial troponin-I was
10.

His initial electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus
rhythm at 80 beats per minute, intraventricular conduction
delay, normal axis, minimal ST segment depressions in leads
V4 through V6; his ST segment changes were slightly different
compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2146-3-18**].

On initial chest radiograph, he had persistent chronic
changes, no evidence of failure, and no acute cardiopulmonary
process.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:  After the initial troponin value of 10,
the patient subsequently had troponin values of 15 and then
9.  Given his elevated troponins in the setting of
hypotension on admission, the patient was felt to have had a
recent NSTEMI in the setting of low effective circulating
volume.  In the absence of recent or active chest pain or
anginal symptoms, and given the patient's acute renal
failure, it was thought that this myocardial infarction most
likely occurred within seven days prior to admission.
Because he appeared to have a low effective circulating
volume on admission, the patient was aggressive rehydrated
with intravenous fluids with a subsequent good response in
his blood pressure.

In order to evaluate whether or not the patient had any new
clinically significant ischemic changes resulting from his
NSTEMI, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on
hospital day two.  This study demonstrated that the left
atrium is mildly dilated, the left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal, there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated.  There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, the
aortic root is moderately dilated, and there were no
significant valvular abnormalities noted.

Overall, compared with the report of a prior transthoracic
echocardiogram done on [**2142-6-27**], no major changes were
found on this transthoracic echocardiogram.

In order to further evaluate the patient's NSTEMI, he had a
small P-MIBI on the day prior to discharge.  During this
study, he had no angina or ischemic electrocardiogram
changes.  The nuclear portion of this study demonstrated a
moderate, fixed defect in the inferior myocardial wall,
enlarged left and right ventricles, and global hypokinesis
with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 18%.  When
compared to the prior study of [**2142-8-27**], there was
significant interval deterioration.

In terms of the patient's hypotension on admission, by
hospital day two, his standing metoprolol dose was restarted.
On hospital day three, his ACEI was reinstituted, and on the
day prior to discharge, he was restarted on his standing
furosemide dose for his significant congestive heart failure.

2. Renal:  The patient's renal function improved dramatically
following aggressive fluid resuscitation.  On the day prior
to discharge, his serum creatinine was 1.0; on the day of
discharge it was 1.2 following the reinitiation of therapy
with furosemide.

3. Endocrine:  Given the patient's presentation with relative
hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension, there was
consideration given to the possibility of adrenal
insufficiency, especially given the patient's prolonged
steroid use.  Of note, his prednisone dose had reportedly
recently been changed from 7 mg daily to 6 mg daily.  D
