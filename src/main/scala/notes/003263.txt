Chief Complaint:
Chest pain --> bradycardia

History of Present Illness:
76 yo man with DM, HTN, HL, (possibly CHF, CAD) who presented to
OSH today after several days of worsening CP and apparently self
titrating up of his home medical regimen (see below: digoxin,
BB, amlodipine) who was found to be bradycardic to 20s (? BP)
and was electively intubated (difficult intubation) and was
externally paced.  While at OSH, he received 1mg of atropine,
digibind (1 vial), calcium gluconate (10g), glucagon (4mg).  He
was also started on Dopamine and propofol.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.
.
On arrival to OSH his BP was 100/40 and in ventricular escape.
with rate in 20s.  His BP trended upward to 229/112 prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] attempt to place an internal
pacer (now at R atrium vs. vent. wall) was made, however there
was no capture.  He required continued external pacing
throughout as apparently w/o this he had no intrinsic rhythm.
He received 4 vials of dibibond, 4mg glucagon, 2mg of calcium
gluconate.  The patient spontaneously converted to slow afib
with LBBB.
.
Unable to obtain ROS given intubation.

IMAGING:
TTE (on admission): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage. No intracardiac shunt seen
at rest (with agitated saline). No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
atria/ atrial appendages. No intracardiac shunt. No thoracic
aortic dissection. Normal global [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic
function. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

EKG: Atrial fibrillation. Left bundle-branch block. Since the
previous tracing of [**2113-3-27**] no significant change.

CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
2. Moderate-to-severe small vessel ischemic changes.

CT chest/abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar consolidative opacities, likely atelectasis.
Superimposed
pneumonia however is not excluded and may account for the
enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes. Small focus of hyperdense
material at the right base could suggest aspiration.
2. CBD dilation without intrahepatic duct dilation. No definite
mass or
stone. A non-emergent MRCP could be used to further evaluate.
Probable
gallbladder sludge. Changes from initial wet read were discussed
via phone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10755**] at 9:20pm on [**2113-5-19**].
3. Left adrenal nodule, indeterminate for an adenoma. If
clinically warranted, recommend dedicated adrenal cross
sectional imaging.

Abdominal U/S:
IMPRESSION: Dilated common bile duct measuring 1.9 cm
proximally, tapering
down to 0.8 cm but not completely visualized along its entire
length. No
cause for dilation identified. Further evaluation with an MRCP
is
recommended.
