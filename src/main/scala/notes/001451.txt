Brief Hospital Course:
On hospital day one, patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] and
his surgical team.  At that time his hematocrit was noted to be
26.1, down slightly from 28 on [**12-24**].  He was transfused 2 units
of packed red blood celss with an appropriate increase in
hematocrit to 28.  While stool was noted to be guiac positive,
subsequent NG levage cleared easily, and there was no evidence
of further bleeding.  Over the next 2 days of observation,
patients vital signs remained stable, and there was no change in
hematocrit.  After a final evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**], it wa
fealt that the patoent was appropriate for discharge back to
rehab.
