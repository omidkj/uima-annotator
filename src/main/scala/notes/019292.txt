Service:  MICU GREEN

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34-year-old
male with severe [**Hospital 46283**] transferred from the floor for
optimization of treatment for worsening hypoxemia.  He was
diagnosed with IPF in [**2121-8-12**] by open lung biopsy,
treated with prednisone and azathioprine.  His last set of
PFTs on [**2121-10-30**] showed an FEV of 35%, FVC 30%, home 02
requirement of [**4-17**] liters.  He was recently put on the
transplant list at [**Hospital6 1708**].  He
presented to [**Location (un) 47**] ER with worsening dyspnea, a
nonproductive cough.  He was given a steroid bolus and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Here, he had a CTA.  There was no PE, new
ground glass opacities were seen.  He was treated with
levofloxacin for seven days for a presumed pneumonia and
diuresed to the point of orthostasis.  A bronch was negative.
All were without improvement of severe intermittent
hypoxemia.

The patient was taken to the unit for a PA catheterization
which showed a CVP of 10, PA of 28/12, and a CWP of 10, and
sent back to the floor.  On the floor, he had repeated
episodes of tachypnea, rigors, and 02 saturations in the 70s
to 80% on a face mask nonrebreather.  The patient was
returned to the MICU and intubated on [**2121-11-10**] for worsening
respiratory failure.  He was treated with antibiotics for
another presumed infection which was also supported by a chest
CT scan. His white count responded. The patient was given
pressure support trials which he failed.

On the morning of [**2121-11-13**], the patient and his family
decided that they would prefer extubation and comfort
measures only.  The patient was extubated on the evening of
[**2121-11-13**].  We were called to the bedside with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 496**], M.D., Pulmonary Fellow, to examine the patient
post extubation.  The patient was cyanotic with no
respirations, no pulse, no heart beat, and no electrical
rhythm on the monitor.  On examination, the pupils were
dilated.  There were no heart sounds or breath sounds after
two minutes of auscultation.  No pulses palpable.  No
response to vigorous sternal rub.  Time of death was called
at 8:52 p.m.  The family was present and declined a
postmortem examination.
