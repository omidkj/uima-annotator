Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 714**] [**Known lastname 19004**] is a 74-year-old woman with widely
metastatic breast cancer (metastases to brain, lung, bone, and
liver), on Coumadin for DVT, history of a with right sided
deficit, who presented with an acute change in mental status,
weakness, and word garbling per her husband now with altered
mental status, word garbling, and weakness per husband.

Per report from her husband, patient was doing well until one
week ago.  At that time she developed bilateral sharp shooting
pain in her thighs, radiating up to her pelvis and inguinal
area.  She spoke with her oncology team, and was given a
prescription for oxycodone 20 mg, which she took [**Hospital1 **].  She also
developed diffuse pruritis around the same time, but no rash.
She has continued to have pain that is responsive to oxycodone.


Yesterday, she went for an INR check and felt lethargic and
weak.  Her weakness was more notable on her left side, which is
usually her stronger side.  She was unable to get out of the car
without significant assistance.  She was noted to be slurring
her speech, but otherwise was making sense.  At the [**Hospital 263**] clinic,
the nursing team had a difficult time obtaining blood.  She then
reported she wanted to go home and go to bed.  She then went to
bed, and per her husband, awoke later than usual in the morning,
around 10 AM.  He noticed at that time her face was asymmetric,
especially her mouth.  She again had difficulty speaking and it
was apparently difficult to get the words out.  She did not want
breakfast, and her husband fed her breakfast.  At this time, her
husband was concerned and brought her in for evaluation.  He
states she has not urinated since yesterday.  There had been no
changes in her urine noted.  She has poor PO intake, usually
only eating breakfast, with poor fluid intake.  She was also
recently started on Megace, which was stopped about one week ago
due to an elevated INR.

In the emergency department, her initial vital signs were:
temperature of 98.1 F, blood pressure of 102/80, heart rate of
86, respiratory rate of 16, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room
air.  While in the emergency room, her blood pressure flucuated
from 67 systolic to 93 systolic.  She received a total of three
liters of IVF for intermittent hypotension, with fair response.
She was given 2 grams of ceftriaxone, 1 gram of vancomycin, 2
grams of ampicillin, 25 mg of benadryl, and percocet 5/325 mg
times two.

She was noted to have a right-sided facial droop, which per
report was old.  She was guaiac negative. A head CT was without
a bleed or edema.  Her laboratories were remarkable for
thrombocytopenia, anemia, and new renal failure.  An
urinanalysis was unremarkable. She was started on empiric
coverage for bacterial meningitis and was given 1 gram of
vancomycin and 1 gram of ceftriaxone after recommendations given
by the oncology team to the emergency room physicians.  A lumbar
puncture was not pursued as her INR was 4.2, and it was felt
this was no consistent with her goals of care.

While she was in the emergency room, her mental status may have
improved somewhat, but she is not back to her baseline. Upon
sign-out to ICU team, ampicillin for Listeria coverage was
discussed and given prior to leaving the ED.

Of note, her last gemcitabine therapy was on [**2145-3-3**], with
neupogen given on [**2145-3-4**] and [**2145-3-5**].  Per report from her
husband, this therapy is no longer working, and a different
therapy plan will be pursued in the coming weeks.

Upon arrival to the ICU, patient's blood pressure was 102/46.
She denied any discomfort and would answer some questions
appropriately.

Review of systems is otherwise negative for fevers, recent
illness, chills, nightsweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

Past Medical History:
She was born at home in [**2070**] without any TORCH perinatal
infections.  She does not have diabetes, hypertension, or COPD.
She has cardiomyopathy from Adriamycin.

Social History:
Patient does not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Per OMR
notes, she drinks a glass of wine a few times a week. She lives
with her husband, and mainly bed-bound.

Family History:
Father died of rectal cancer.

Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.3 F, pulse 97, blood pressure
103/58, respiration 20, and oxygen saturation 98%in room air.

fold.
NECK: Supple, flat JVP, no LAD appreciated. No meningismus,
Kernig and Brudzinski signs negative
CARDIAC: Regular, III/VI SEM best heard at RUSB, no rubs or
gallops

occasional wheeze, few rales at bases
ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no dullness to percussion, no

CXR [**3-20**]:
1. Left lower lobe opacity may represent pneumonia or edema.
Recommend repeat
imaging after diuresis to excluded underlying infection.

2. Minimal CHF.

3. Moderate left and small right pleural effusion.

Head CTA [**3-23**]:
1. No evidence of stenoses in the cervical or intracranial
arteries. No
evidence of intracranial aneurysms.

2. No CT signs of an acute infarction. MRI would be more
sensitive for an
acute infarction.

3. Unchanged intracranial calcifications, consistent with
treated metastases.

4. Unchanged sclerotic bone lesions in the spine. Sclerotic
lesions in the
sternum, not previously imaged. These are consistent with
metastases.

5. Patchy pulmonary opacities in the imaged upper lungs.
Partially imaged
pleural effusions. Clinical correlation is recommended. Further
evaluation
may be performed by dedicated chest imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Ms. [**Known firstname 714**] [**Known lastname 19004**] is a 74-year-old woman with past medical
history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA
and cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status and
feeling of weakness on left side.  Has weakness on right side at
baseline.

(1) Altered Mental Status: Patient had altered mental status on
admission and thru [**2145-3-22**], oriented only to self and was
combative.  On [**2145-3-23**], her mental status improved
dramatically.  This is thought likely to be toxic/metabolic
factors in the setting of old CVA deficits.  The toxic/metabolic
factors could include penumonia, oxycodo
