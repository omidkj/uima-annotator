Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2136-8-27**] aortic valve replacement (21mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
pericardial),coronary artery bypass graft (Svg-RCA)
[**2136-8-23**]  Simple extractions numbers 10 and 20

History of Present Illness:
84 yo F with PMH severe AS by echo ([**2136-6-8**]) with peak gradient
66mg, mean of 38mmHg, aortic valve area 0.5cm2 without aortic
insufficiency, COPD (mild), GERD, HLD, arthritis, and occult
anemia transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation for valve
replacement. She was in her usual good state of health until 2
days prior to admission at [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-17**], when she noticed DOE
and mild SOB. She denied any chest pain, palpitations or cough.
At baseline, works 4 days/week and is physically active. On
admission, she had SOB and AMS requiring intubation in ER. CXR
showed pulmonary edema. She received 40mg IV Lasix and had
significant diuresis. While in ICU, she was agitated on vent.
She was extubated this AM and found to have mild confusion but
alert and oriented to place, person, month, year and day (not
date). Of note, she was also started on abx and steroids due to
D/D of COPD acute exacerbation; is planned for quick prednisone
taper and short abx course. cardiac surgery was consulted for
aortic valve replacement.

GENERAL: NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.

pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with JVP of 9 cm.
CARDIAC: Tachy, normal S1, S2. Systolic murmur.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. CTAB,
no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.  Poor inspiratory effort.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominal bruits.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ [**Last Name (un) **],a. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2136-8-22**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent
with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Critical aortic stenosis.
Moderate to severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated estimated PCWP.
Very small anterior pericardial effusion.
.
CAROTID US [**2136-8-22**]:
Right ICA <40% stenosis.
Left ICA <40% stenosis.
.
CXR [**8-18**] OSH: Mild pulmonary edema, improved from day prior.
Small right pleural effusion.
.
ECHO [**2136-6-8**] OSH: Severe AS with peak gradient of 66 mmHg,
mean of 28 mmHg. Valve area os 0.5 cm2. Thickened mitral
leaflets, calcified annulus, mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1754**]. Normal
RV. Borderline normal LV. LVEF 50-55%. Mild pulm hypertension,
estimated PA pressure 45mmHg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 36589**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2136-8-19**] via transfer
from [**Hospital3 **] for aortic valve replacement.On arrival she
was stable, but still with some dyspnea. Over the course of the
day her respiratory status worsening, with hypoxia, increasing
respiratory rate, increasing pulse and hypertension. A chest
xray revealed worsening pulmonary edema. She responded well to
lasix 40mg IV and morphine, with resolution of symptoms after
diuresis. She remained stable and comfortable on home regimen of
lasix 20mg PO daily. She was initially brought to the OR on
[**8-24**], but had a coughing fit with concern for pneunomia. She was
brought back to the floor and a chest xray revealed improving
pulmonary edema without infiltrates. She was monitored over the
weekend without event and returned to the OR on [**2136-8-27**] where
she underwen Coronary bypass grafting x1 with reverse saphenous
vein
graft to the right coronary artery/ Aortic valve replacement
with a 21-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease pericardial tissue valve.
CROSS-CLAMP TIME:87 minutes.PUMP TIME:106 minutes. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was transferred
to the intensive care unit for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. Her CVICU course was uneventful and she transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day two. Chest tubes and pacing wires
were removed without complication. Beta blockade was resumed and
advanced as tolerated. An ACE-I was not able to be resumed at
this time due to her blood pressure. This will need to be
readdressed as an outpatient due to her LVEF=30%. She remained
in a normal sinus rhythm. Over several days, she continued to
make clinical improvement with diuresis. She was eventually
cleared for discharge to [**Hospital3 13990**] Health Care  rehab on
postoperative day # 5.All follow up appointments were advised.
