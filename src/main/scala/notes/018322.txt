Brief Hospital Course:
# Bright red blood per rectum: The patient presented with a
hematocrit of 21, down from a baseline hematocrit of 30, with
maroon stools with clots.  The patient was actively bleeding and
symptomatic despite stable vital signs.  The patient received 2
units of packed red blood cells in the emergency room and an
additional unit upon arriving in the MICU.  The
gastro-intestinal team was consulted and planned to scope the
patient (colonoscopy and upper endoscopy)on Tuesday [**7-6**].  The
patient was treated with IV pantoprazole and an oral bowel
regiment (no stool since admission). The patient's hematocrit
was stable overnight without active bleeding and stable vital
signs.  In total, patient received 5 units of blood with Hct
increaed to around 30.  The  patient was transferred to the
floor on the afternoon of [**7-3**] for further management.  On the
floor, his hematocrits were stable.  He was prepped for
endoscopy and underwent the procedure on [**7-7**].  [**Last Name (un) **] and EGD did
not reveal any source of bleeding. GI suggests out-pt capsule
study and repeat screening [**Last Name (un) **] at discretion of PMD as prep was
not adequate to screen for colon CA.
.
# Right Lower Lung Opacity: The patient's CXR had a right lower
lobe opacity on chest xray.  It was decided to not pursue
treatment as the patient was asymptomatic, afebrile, and had a
normal white count. Of note - the patient was given a
prescription for levaquin one week prior at an OSH for reasons
the patient does not recall.
.
# Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has known
diastolic congestive heart failure with multiple admissions in
the past few months for shortness of breath. The patient was
considered to be at risk for developing flash pulmonary edema
while receiving transfusions.  The patients pressures and
respiratory status were stable overnight.  On the floor, his
home medications (labetalol, lasix, amlodipine) were restarted.
.
# Hypertension: The patient was normotensive on admission to the
MICU.  The patient has a history uncontrolled hypertension.  The
patient's anti-hypertensive medications were held to maintain
normo-tensive pressures as the patiet was at risk for flash
edema given blood products and diastolic heart failure.  His
home medications were restarted on the floor.  To control his
blood pressure, his labetalol was increased to 400 mg tid and
captopril was added and up-titrated to 50 mg tid.  On discharge,
his blood pressures are controlled with SBP in 150s.  Will
discharge patient on increased dose of HTN medications.
Recommend follow-up with PCP for adjustment of meds.
.
# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:   The patient is on 2
liters of nasal cannula oxygen supplementation at home.  The
patient was administered albuterol nebulizer treatment as needed
and was continued on his home dose of tiotropium and fluticasone
inhalers during his stay.  The patient did not have any episodes
of respiratory distress in the MICU.  On the floor, he was kept
on [**3-5**] L of oxygen and had stable O2 sats.
.
# CKD:  The patient's creatinine was 2.2 on admission to the
MICU which is up from baseline of 1.  The patient was likely
pre-renal on admission secondary to blood loss. The patient's
creatinine was 1.7 at the time of discharge form the MICU.  On
the floor, Cr remained at 1.8.
.
# BPH: The patient was continued on doxazosin and finasteride
daily.
.
# Glaucoma/Cataracts: The patient was continued on his home eye
drop regiment.
.
# Nutrition:  As the patients's hematocrit was stable and there
was no active bleeding evident, he was advanced to a soft diet
on [**7-3**].  He was kept NPO for the procedure.  He advanced to
regular diet prior to discharge.
