Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mediastinoscopy, lymph node biopsy

History of Present Illness:
83 y/o man with PMH significant for type 2 DM, CHF, first degree
AV block, and recent 2 month illness characterized by weight
loss and failure to thrive who was admitted through the ED on
sepsis protocol. Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-13**]
through [**12-23**] with failure to thrive. At that time, he was
evaluated for a possible malignancy given the presence of
widspread lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow biopsy was done which was
consistent with a possible myeloproliferative disorder.
Interventional pulmonary then did a BAL and TBNA on [**12-20**] which
was nondiagnostic without malignant cells. Therefor, the pt was
scheduled for a mediastinoscopy with thoracic surgery but has
not yet received this procedure. During this admission, the pt
was also treated for possible sepsis since he had hypotension
with a SBP in the 80s and an elevated WBC count of 23 on
admission. He was treated emperically with vancomycin and
aztreonam. These were then discontinued as his WBC count
decreased but he was continued on stress dose steroids. Pt was
discharged to rehab on [**12-23**].
.
Pt did fairly well at rehab until [**2190-12-28**] when per report he
suffered a fall. Pt was apparently not injured but this morning
he was unresponsive and wouldn't follow commands. The pt's wife
reported that he hadn't had any new complaints over the past few
days. It is unclear what occurred during the course of the day
at the nursing home and further information will need to be
obtained. However, at 6:00 PM he was noted to be pale and
diaphoretic with a temperature of 102.8 and BP of 100/50. He was
transported to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's VS were 104, tachycardia to the 140s, and
hypotensive to the 90s/50s. He was intubated for altered mental
status. Pt was then placed on the sepsis protocol. He received
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl in addition to stress dose
steroids. The pt also received three liters of normal saline. Pt
was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.

I/o 1800/2400
General: awake, alert NAD, elderly male.
HEENT: perrl, eomi, mmm
Chest: good air movement, no wheezes, crackles
CV: RRR, systolic murmur LUSB
abd: soft, NT/ND, no HSM
ext: no c/c/e. distal pulses palpable

Pertinent Results:
[**12-29**] CXR:
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes are
reduced.
Pulmonary vascular markings are somewhat indistinct but without
frank
pulmonary edema. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip just
proximal to the carina. An NG tube is seen with its tip in the
stomach. There is a right IJ central venous catheter with its
tip in the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is seen on this supine
radiograph.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Lines and tubes in satisfactory
position.

[**12-29**] Non-contrast head CT:
FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. Low attenuation within the
periventricular white matter is consistent with small vessel
infarction. There is mild mucosal thickening within the left
maxillary sinus. Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are appropriately aerated. There is no evidence of
fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
2. No major vascular territorial infarction.

[**1-1**] CXR:
CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP: Comparison made to prior study of one
day earlier. A right internal jugular central venous line is
unchanged in position with tip in the mid superior vena cava.
The ET tube has been removed. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. Increased interstitial markings are noted
bilaterally. No infiltrates are present.
IMPRESSION:
Slighty increased interstial pulmonary edema.

[**1-2**] Head CTA:
FINDINGS: The early arterial enhancement phase of this CTA may
be suboptimal for the detection of intracranial masses. The
noncontrast images of the head are degraded by motion. As
presented, there is no change from the prior day. There is no
intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal extraaxial fluid collection,
mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles are unchanged in
configuration. Low attenuation in the periventricular white
matter remains similar in appearance. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
interface is preserved. No enhancing intracranial lesion is
detected. The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appear
patent, without significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.
No arteriovenous malformation is detected.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial mass is identified. See note above
re: CTA
technique relating to mass lesion detection.

[**1-5**] RUQ U/S:
FINDINGS: The liver is markedly heterogenous, with predominantly
increased
echogenicity with multiple focal areas of decreased
echogenicity, which
appears to be increased in number and size compared to the prior
study. Common bile duct is not dilated. There is no evidence of
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Gallbladder is mildly dilated,
with sludges. Spleen measures 15 cm. The previously noted
multiple nodules in the spleen could not be well demonstrated on
the present study, in this patient who could not hold the
breath. Note is made of ascites.

IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly heterogenous echotexture of the liver, with multiple
small
hypodense areas, the largest one in the right lobe measuring 2.5
cm, which
appears to be increased in size and number compared to the prior
CT study. The findings probably represent microabscess, or
hepatic involvement of malignancy such as lymphoma. Please
correlate clinically.
2. Splenomegaly. Prior noted splenic lesions are not well
demonstrated on
the present study.
3. Ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was suspected of being septic, with fever
to 104F, mental status changes, hypotension, and leukocytosis
with left-shift. He was intubated and placed on the sepsis
protocol, and was placed on vancomycin, flagyl, cefepime, and
acyclovir. The latter was added due to HSV-like cytopathic
effects seen on [**12-18**] BAL. Cefepime switched to ceftriaxone on
ID recommendations on [**12-31**]. No evidence of PNA on CXR. UA
normal with no growth on UCx. [**12-30**] blood cultures had no growth
on bacterial cultures, and preliminarily no growth on fungal or
mycobacterial cultures.

LP was done [**12-30**], which showed no evidence of meningitis. CSF
