Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
80 yo male with COPD, afib, HTN, who presents today after having
worsening dyspnea at home. Patient states that earlier today, he
became acutely dyspneic and had significant wheezing after
eating lunch. He denies any preceding aspiration event. He tried
a neb treatment in the afternoon, which usually works for him,
but this time, he did not feel better. He does report recent URI
symptoms, with a whitish sputum production over the last few
days. He denies fevers, chills, chest pains, orthopnea, or
abdominal pain. He subsequently presented to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS: 97.9, 147/77, 116, 34, 100% NRB. He was
given nebs, magnesium, and levofloxacin in the ED for presumed
COPD exacerbation. His CXR did not show any infiltrate. He had
an ECG with a RBBB, but no prior available for comparison. He
was initially placed on BiPAP (18/8), but then given his
improvement, he was changed back to nasal cannula. Prior to the
time of transfer, he was changed to 2L NC, but he had increased
work of breathing, and was eventually switched back to BiPAP.
His vitals prior to transfer were 104, 106/71, 27, 98%2L NC. His
ABG at that time was 7.41/50/81.

Currently, he has difficulty speaking more than a few words at a
time. He is still on the BIPAP mask. He denies any current chest
pain.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo male with COPD, Afib, HTN, who presents with dyspnea and
wheezing

# Dyspnea/Wheezing: Initially presentation was most consistent
with a COPD exacerbation. There was no clear inciting event,
though most likely either from a viral URI or aspiration event.
A CXR did not show any infiltrate to suggest PNA. He was
initially placed on BiPAP given his significant wheezing,
respiratory distress, and tachypnea with improvement.  He was
maintained on standing ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers
initially.  The patient became quite agitated on albuterol, and
switched to xopenex with some improvement.  He was also started
on methylprednisolone as well for a COPD exacerbation.  He was
given a 5 day course of levofloxacin. His sputum culture grew
oropharyngeal flora and repiratory viral studies were all
negative. His blood/urine cultures were negative as well.

Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to a prednisone taper-
he should take 50 mg x 5 days, 40 mg x 5 days, 30 mg x 5 days,
20 mg x 5 days, and 10 mg x 5 days then stop.  He was discharged
with a shovel face mask just for comfort, but his oxygen
saturations were 96% on RA.

If patient is to be on greater than or equal to 20 mg of
prednisone daily for
