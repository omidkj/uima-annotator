remote CABG at NEDH (approx 15 years ago), cardiomyopathy with
EF last measured at 15%, and mild memory impairment who
presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ER last night after multiple falls
in a 24-hour period of time. Patient was walking from his bed to

his right shoulder on the sink on the way down. X ray at OSH was
of poor quality but showed possible greater trochanter fracture.

Imaging:
X-ray
Three views of the right shoulder are slightly limited by this
patient's large size. There is an essentially undisplaced
fracture of the right neck of the humerus, probably extending
into the greater tuberosity. No other fractures and no
dislocation. Visualized left lung clear.

[**12-7**] EKG:

Sinus rhythm. Borderline P-R interval prolongation. Left atrial
abnormality.
Left bundle-branch block. Consider inferior myocardial
infarction. No previous
tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
# NSTEMI: Pt presented with Trop 0.13 with peak at 0.17 and CK
1,211. Given his long standing history of CAD + EKG with Q waves
with elevated enzymes in a diabetic pt, there was initial
concern for possible MI. However, the elevated CK was attributed
to MSK injury and the troponin elevation was secondary to demand
ischemia in setting of renal insufficiecny. CK trended down to
178 by day of discharge and trop dropped to 0.14.
Catheterization deferred. Pt had no chest pain symptoms. Patient
continued on ASA, atorvastatin, and carvedilol.
.
# Systolic CHF:  History of CHF with most recent EF of 15% in
[**Month (only) **]. Pt did not appear fluid overloaded. Chest X-ray on
[**12-7**] demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary congestion. Although
pt qualified for ICD, pt and family wished to decline at this
time. Continued Losartan and Carvedilol.
.
# Leukocytosis: No obvious signs of infection. Urine culture
with 10-100K gram negative rods, ID and sensitivities pending.
Pt was started on Cipro for 7 day course. WBC trended down
during hospitaliztion, 9.2 at discharge.
.
#  Shoulder fracture: Pt had right humeral neck non-displaced
fracture from fall. Orthopedics recommended a sling for comfort.
The patient's pain was treated symptomatically with a lidoderm
patch, prn tylenol and ice packs. Ortho reccomended he follow up
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in a few weeks for repeat x-rays of his
right shoulder on arrival.  If the x-rays look okay, he can
start passive ROM of his
shoulder for 4 weeks followed by active ROM after repeat x-rays.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Unclear baseline Cr but was
1.5 in [**Month (only) 462**] and  2.1 on admission. Pre-renal by lytes.
Patient was given small bolus of 250 mL on [**12-8**] after
creatinine had risen to 2.4, it then trended down to 1.2 by day
of discharge.
.
# Dementia: Pt was near baseline per wife. [**Name (NI) **] has mild
impairment in short term memory.
.
# DM2: Home insulin regimen was given. Metformin was held in
setting of acute kidney injury. A1c=6.7.
.
# HTN: Normotensive on admission. Home antihypertensive meds
were continued.
.
# History of falls: Unclear etiology. History was not consistent
with syncope or seizure. Worked up for both in past at OSH.
Falls likely secondary to his peripheral neuropathy. RPR was
negative. Pt takes monthly B12 injections. Geriatrics was
consulted. They started pt on Vit D and recc he continue
gabapentin and hold his percocet. He has not received any
percocet in the last 72 hours and has had no pain. B12 levels
were checked and WNL, 366. Vitamin D level was checked and is
pending at this time. It was strongly recommended to the patient
that he should go to rehabilitation after discharge but he
refused, stating "I will be careful at home". Family was unable
to dissuade him. He was observed walking with rolling [**Name6 (MD) **] by
RN and CCU team, is mostly steady and shows good exercise
tolerance. He will go home by ambulance and get maximum services
at home including [**Hospital 37739**] home health aide and nursing.
.
# Hyperlidipdemia: Continued statin therapy.
.
# Gout: Allopurinol therapy continued.
.
# COPD: Continued oxygen and prn Combivent.
.
# Peripheral Neuropathy: Continued gabapentin. Did not require
narcotics for foot pain while on the step down unit.

Vitamin D level sent, will need to be followed up after
discharge.
Final urine culture results should be followed up after
discharge.
