Zosyn/levo and d/c'd with LSC line in place. On [**3-15**], in [**Name (NI) **], pt
r/o for DVT in RUE, however, noted to have whole body rash,
hypothermia to 92, hypotension to 80s. CXR c/w mild CHF. Sepsis
protocol was initiated: LSC pulled, new RIJ placed, and pt
received Vanco/Zosyn and started on levophed. He was admitted to
the MICU for further management

Physical Exam:
T=97.6,BP=94/47-106/57,HR=96-99,RR=23-29,O2=95-96% on 4L NC
Gen: Pt in tired appearing, in mild resp distress, with audible
rhoncherous BS's
HEENT: nonicteric, mucosa slightly dry
CV: RRR, difficult exam secondary to BS's
Lungs: diffuse rhochi and exp wheezing ant and lat

Extrem: [**1-24**] LE edema bilaterally
Neuro: pt somnolent but arounsable; will answer simple
questions; not clearly oriented to place or time
Skin: diffuse erythematous rash of ant thighs, abdomen and chest

Pertinent Results:
Upper extremity noninvasive: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of
the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, and brachial
veins were performed. Normal flow, compressibility, and
waveforms are demonstrated. Intraluminal thrombus is not
identified. The cephalic and basilic veins are also patent.
Evaluation of the left subclavian vein is unremarkable.
.
CT head: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major
vascular territorial infarction. Again noted is a large sellar
mass, which is eroding into the sphenoid sinus and intimately
involved with the right internal carotid artery and cavernous
sinus. [**Doctor First Name **] ganglia calcifications are again identified.
Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are stable.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Redemonstration of large
invasive sellar mass.

.
SINGLE PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again seen is a
left subclavian central line with its tip terminating in the
superior vena cava. Again seen is marked cardiomegaly with
bilateral perihilar opacities and vascular redistribution
consistent with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. The
left costophrenic angle is not included on the film. There
appears to be a small right-sided pleural effusion. No
pneumothoraces are identified.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU, he was broadly covered with Vanco/Zosyn, stress
dose steroids (given panhypopituitarism) for sepsis attributed
to RUL PNA. He was subsequently found to have C. diff and
metronidazole was added to his antibiotic regimen. Fluid
resusicitation was limited given pts CHF/pumonary status in the
setting of being DNR/DNI. His pressors were broadened to
levophed/vasopressin with limited response. On [**3-19**], given
declining clinical status despite maximal therapy, a family
meeting was held and pt was made CMO.  He was transfered to the
floor on [**3-19**] overnight.  Patient's was continued on Morphine
gtt.  He expired on [**3-20**].
