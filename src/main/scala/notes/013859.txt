History of Present Illness:
50 yo M with CAD s/p multiple PCI, CHF, AFIB on coumadin, and
active cocaine use presented to the ED this morning c/o 3 days
of epigastric pain and melanotic stools. He was discharged from
the medicine service at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-5-18**]. The reason for this
prior admission was initially chest pain, which was thought to
be non-cardiac, but his hospitalization was prolonged by severe
knee pain.  Despite the absence of crystals on joint aspiration,
he was empirically treated for gout and started on prednisone
20mg daily, allopurinol, colchicine, and pantoprazole; his
ranitidine was stopped. He was discharged on a lovenox bridge
for 2 doses but never received it.
.
Per patient, the day after discharge, he developed diffuse
abdominal pain and noted black stools. The consistency of the
stool varied between soft to hard. Denied BRBPR. He also
experienced some dizziness and substern chest pressure, but no
chest pain similar to prior MI. He endorses using cocaine on the
day prior to admission. Otherwise denied alcohol or tobacco use
or any ingestions.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.1, P 72, BP 102/76, R 22, O2
sat 100% RA. Initial Hct was 39.6, down slightly from his
baseline in the low 40's. BUN was elevated to 40s from a
baseline of 10, and Cr to 1.3 from a baseline of ~1.0. Abd CT
with po/IV contrast done as the ED staff was concerned for
mesenteric ischemia given the epigastric pain in the setting of
recent cocaine use--CT Abd preliminary read unremarkable. NG
lavage was notable for "specks" or BRB which cleared after
500cc. Rectal exam notable for melena.
.
He was given morphine 4mg IV twice for epigastric pain in
addition to zofran. GI was consulted and he was given 10mg IV
vit K + 2u FFP for INR 1.7.  He developed a diffuse urticarial
rash after receiving FFP for which he received 50mg of benadryl.
 During the initial 6 hours of his ED stay, he received 1L NS.
Immediately prior to transfer: HR= 108, BP= 132/68 and a second
liter of NS was started.
.
On the floor, patient was slightly tachycardic and complaining
of diffuse abdminal, shoulder, leg pain. He reported nausea but
no vomiting.
.

Labs on Discharge:

Imaging:
[**2180-5-20**]
- CXR: The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. The
lungs are
grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or
pulmonary
edema. Bony structures are intact.
- CT abd/pelvis: The visualized lung bases demonstrate slight
atelectasis but no masses, nodules or pleural effusions. The
spleen, adrenals, pancreas, and liver appear within normal
limits. Patient is status post cholecystectomy with clips in the
gallbladder fossa. Kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
symmetrically without solid masses or hydronephrosis.
Hypodensities in the mid pole of the left kidney (2:32) is too
small to characterize but is likely a cyst. No free air or free
fluid or adenopathy is present. Incidental note is made of a
circumaortic left renal vein but the aorta and its mesenteric
branches are patent. Stomach and bowel appear normal.  PELVIS:
Bowel loops appear normal including a normal visualized
appendix.  The bladder is normal in appearance. No free air or
free fluid or adenopathy is present.  BONE WINDOWS: No
suspicious bone lesions are present. Degenerative changes are
present in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:
No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis to explain patient's
symptoms.

- KUB: The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. The
lungs are
grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or
pulmonary
edema. Bony structures are intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo M with CAD s/p multiple PCI, CHF, AFIB on coumadin, and
active cocaine use, presents with 3 days of epigastric pain and
melanotic stools, concerning for GI bleed.

# GI bleed: Patient noted to have occult positive stool,
however, NG lavage only borderline positive.  Hct is stable at
39 though lower than baseline of mid-40s. Most likely etiology
of GI bleed is from medications, which includes prednisone
(recently started), baseline aspirin, plavix, coumadin, and
lovenox.  H2-blocker was also recently stopped and patient
transitioned to PPI.  All of these medications would make the
patient more prone to bleed.  On presentation, he was slighly
tachycardic with HR in the 100s, most likely from not receiving
home diltiazem and metoprolol.  He was started with IV
pantoprazole gtt.  Coumadin, Lovenox and Plavix were held.  His
initial q6h Hct series remai
