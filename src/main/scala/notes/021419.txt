UPDATE on FLOOR:
1. GIB: active bleed at splenic fx was detected during the
nuclear study; 2 large bore ivs were placed and pt did require
four units of pRBCs along with 2 units of FFP. Since the
patient's crit did not bump appropriately, pt was sent to ICU
where she was ultimately taken for colonoscopy, which revealed
multiple diverticuli, one of which demonstrated stigmata of
recent bleed-this was cauterized and the pt had no further
bleeding. Tolerated po well & was asymptomatic.

Pt's ASA and coumadin were held initially.  The ASA was
restarted due to her extensive CAD hx but the coumadin has been
discontinued at discharge in light of her life-threatening
bleed.  This pt does have a substantial stroke risk due to her
afib and CHF but the risks of coumadin therapy seem to outweigh
the benefits after this admission for severe LGIB.

2. CAD: Pt ruled out for MI; she at no point complained of chest
pain and serial ekgs were unremarkable and continue to
demonstrate a paced rhythm.

3. CHF: Pt demonstrated no signs of acute CHF and her CHF
regimen of ace, beta blocker, lasix, aldactone and imdur were
gently restarted during her course of imptovement.

4. HTN: PT now back on her HTN regimen with good BP control.
5. Afib: amio was continued along with her beta blocker.  Pt had
good rate control during the later portions of the
hospitalization.  Pt has been taken off of coumadin as described
above.
6. anemia: serial crits were followed and were stable after
initial transfusion.
7. dementia: donepizil continued; pt seemed reasonably well
oriented but continued to have short term memory/memory
consolidation problems.
8. [**Name2 (NI) **]: guardianship is being pursued at [**Name (NI) 582**]; pt
transferred back there to resume this process
