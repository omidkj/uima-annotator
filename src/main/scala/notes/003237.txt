Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old woman with past medical history
significant for COPD (0.55 FEV1/FVC 38% of predicted on home
O2), status post left upper lobe endobronchial lung reduction,
CAD, CHF, PVD status post multiple bypass surgeries, on chronic
anticoagulation who presented with worsened dyspnea over the
past 4 weeks associated with hoarseness of voice since 2 weeks.
On admission, she was noted to have INR 8.1 in her PCP's office.
She was also found to have a CXR which showed left lung collapse
with tracheal deviation to the left, and was referred to our ED
for this, where she received a combivent nebulizer prior to
transfer. On presentation to the ED, the patient was complaining
of dyspnea and was tachypneic with respiratory rate to 25 with
O2 sat 95% on 5L. Otherwise, her systolic blood pressure was in
the 110 range and pulse in 80-90 range. Her admission labs were
remarkable for WBC of 22.7 and INR of 11.7. In the ED, she
received two combivent nebulizers and 10 mg SC vitamin K and was
then transferred to the MICU. There, she was given 60 mg
prednisone but she refused this citing history of steroid
induced psychosis; she is currently on a prednisone taper (20 mg
a day currently). She denies any recent chest pain, fever or
chills, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, headache, dysuria
and polyuria.
.
Since presenting to the MICU, she has undergone emergent rigid
bronchoscopy which demonstrated a mass in the left bronchus
which has subsequently been shown to be non small cell
carcinoma, likely squamous cell. Oncology is setting up a
complete outpatient workup for this patient, including Pet CT.
She was also seen by ENT for evaluation of hoarseness. She is on
aspiration precautions for a paralyzed vocal cord and will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33748**] as an outpatient. Two nights prior
to moving out of the MICU, the patient was found to be in
asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with RVR. She was started on an
amiodarone drip and converted back to sinus. Then, she had
another episode the night prior to transfer and converted on IV
amiodarone. She was switched from IV to PO amiodarone on [**8-21**]
and has been in sinus rhythm since the night prior to transfer.

.
At the present time, the patient feels at her baseline. She
denies any shortness of breath that is worse than her usual. She
denies any pain and states that she is "ready to get out" of the
hospital. She denies palpitations and chest pain.

RADIOLOGY:
=========
CXR [**2162-8-17**]-
1. Left lung atelectasis with associated leftward mediastinal
shift. CT scan can be performed for further evaluation to assess
etiology.
2. Emphysema.
.
CT [**2162-8-17**]-
Nearly complete collapse of the left lung, accelerated over
several hours. Heavy secretions throughout left bronchial tree,
could be disguising an endobronchial mass. Severe emphysema.
Ground glass peribronchial opacities in the right lung, likely
infectious, warranting CT. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
presumably reactive
.
CT [**2162-8-20**]-
1. Extensive intrathoracic malignancy, left lower lobe primary
mass with hilar adenopathy obstructing left upper lobe bronchus
and mediastinal extension crossing the midline in both the
subcarinal and lower paratracheal stations.
2. Severe emphysema. Endobronchial reduction valves, left upper
lobe. Left upper lobe fully collapsed.
3. Embolic occlusion proximal left subclavian artery, not due to
tumor invasion.
.
STUDIES:
=======
[**2162-8-18**] Bronchial washing:
ATYPICAL.
Rare atypical squamous cells.
Squamous cells, inflammatory cells and bacteria
.
PATHOLOGY-
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: LEFT MAIN STEM TUMOR FOR F/S, LEFT MAIN STEM
TUMOR (RUSH). [**2162-8-19**]
DIAGNOSIS:
A). "Left main stem tumor biopsy for frozen":
Non-small cell carcinoma, favor squamous cell, focus suspecious
for lymphatic vascular invasion.
B)."Left main stem tumor (fresh)":
Non-small cell carcinoma, favor squamous cell
.
CXR ([**8-20**]): Left lower lobe has been substantially reexpanded.
Left upper lobe remains collapsed and left hilus enlarged. New
bronchial stent extends from the carina to just before the
anticipated location of the left upper lobe takeoff. Left
pleural thickening, unchanged. Leftward mediastinal shift
stable. Severe emphysema in the right lung, otherwise clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 47011**] is a 69 year old female with a history of COPD on
home oxygen (4L NC), status post left upper lobe reduction, CAD,
CHF, peripheral vascular disease on chronic anticoagulation who
presented with dyspnea secondary to left lung collapse and
associated tracheal deviation. On bronchoscopy, the patient had
a mass seen with biopsies taken which were consistent with
squamous cell lung cancer; a subsequent CT chest confirms
extensive intrathroacic malignancy.
.
#) Left lung collapse/atelectasis: On bronchoscopy, a mass was
seen with biopsies taken which were consistent with squamous
cell lung cancer. A subsequent CT chest confirms extensive
intrathroacic malignancy. The patient's left lung collapse
improved with stenting by IP. She has follow-up scheduled with
hematology/oncology and is scheduled for outpatient staging PET
scan.  Oncology will call patient at home with appointments, PET
scan  A social work consult for new diagnosis was obtained.
According to ENT & S&S recs, we will discharge patient home on
aspiration precautions with [**Hospital1 **] PPI, regular diet, medications
given in purees
.
#) Coagulalopathy: The patient did have a supratherapeutic INR
on admission on coumadin. At that time, her coumadin was held,
and her INR improved with vitamin K. Heparin was started for
bridge to coumadin prior to discharge, and transitioned to
lovenox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] until her INR becomes therapeutic.  On day of
discharge, INR was 1.6 today, we therefore increased coumadin to
2mg po daily today, and discharged home on lovenox 50mg SC BID
(to treat embolic occlusion of left subclavian artery), while
waiting for INR to become therapeutic.  Pt was aware, and
amenable to this plan.  She will have home VNA check INR daily
and fax results to PCP ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Telep
