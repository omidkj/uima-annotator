Intubation
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
42 y/o female with PMH sig for depression, pregnancy induced
hypertension, who initially presented to NVMC on [**4-26**] with cc of
SOB x 5 days. She had just finished taking course of
Azithromycin on day of presentation. Per OSH records, also
reports having non-productive cough, severe post-tussive CP,
along with subjective fevers/chills/anorexia. Upon presentation,
patient was afebrile (96), pulse ox 88% RA, WBC 8.1, D-dimer
506, BNP 231, normal CEs. Initial ABG 7.34/46/43 (arterial per
report); CT chest showing no pulmonary embolism but did reveal
bilateral patchy predominantly lower lobe alveolar infiltrates.
Was treated initially for CAP with with Cipro, Ceftaz, Azithro,
admitted to ICU. HIV test send and pending but CD4 count nl
(1276).

Per report, patint required increasing 02 over outside hospital
stay. Bronchoscopy was attempted on [**5-1**] but could not be
performed b/c of hypoxia. On [**5-2**] she was intubated for
progressive hypoxia. Upon intubation, patient required heavy
doses of Versed to be sedated. Subsequently received Vecuronium
along with Versed and Propofol drips. ABG on 100% 02 was
7.36/64/114. Repeat CT scan poor quality but showed ?PE, final
report pending.

BAL:
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2181-5-3**]): 1+ PMNs, NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE NO GROWTH. NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII NOT SEEN.
FUNGAL CULTURE GREW YEAST. NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED. NO VIRUS
ISOLATED.

Cytology (BAL): ATYPICAL.
  Atypical cells with enlarged nuclei and vaculated cytoplasm.
  Numerous alveolar lining cells and pulmonary macrophages.
  No viral cytopathic changes and fungal forms seen.

ECHO [**2181-5-3**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CT chest [**2181-5-4**]:
1) Extensive pneumonia within left lower lobe.
2) Diffuse, predominantly central ground-glass opacity in both
lungs. This may reflect hydrostatic edema, ARDS, or diffuse
infection.
3) Low- density structure within the left adrenal gland is
benign and either represents an adrenal adenoma or myelolipoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure. The patient was initially transferred
from OSH to MICU. The etiology of respiratory failure on
admission was not clear. The patient felt to have had ARDS
possibly secondary to CAP. She was initially treated with broad
spectrum Abx and steroids for PNA/ARDS. She was then continued
on Levaquin only empirically for total 14 days. She was
ventilated ARDs NET protocol. She underwent bronchoscopy to rule
out acute eosinophilic pneumonia or other infectious processes
of respiratory failure and the results were unrevealing. Testing
for Legionella, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia titters were all
negative for evidence of acute infection. BNP was elevated at
777 and the patient received empiric diuresis in ICU.
Echocardiogram was with normal EF. At the time of transfer from
the outside hospital, the patient was on therapeutic doses of
Lovenox because of concern for PC on preliminary report of chest
CT. Lovenox was discontinued after final report came back
negative for PE. The patient's respiratory status has improved
with treatment and she was successfully extubated on [**2181-5-8**].
The patient was then transferred to the regular medical floor.
She continued to require supplemental oxygen at about 3
liters/min and desatted on room air. The patient was discharged
home with supplemental oxygen to wear at all times.

2. Orthostatic hypotension. After extubation, the patient was
noted to have orthostatic hypotension. This felt to be likely
related to adrenal insufficiency given recent quick steroid
taper. She had no nausea, vomiting of other symptoms of adrenal
insufficiency. The patient was gently hydrated and po intake was
encourage without significant improvement in orthostasis. She
was started on dexamethasone in order to have cosyntropin stim
test. Cosyntropin stim test showed normal adrenal function. The
decision was made to discharge the patient on slow prednisone
taper. She worked with physical therapy who cleared her for
discharge home. The patient was instructed on getting up slowly
and other techniques to avoid symptoms of orthostasis.

3. Depression. The patient was continued on Klonopin,
fluoxetine, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, BuSpar. Social work were
consulted regarding the patient's coping (reports of
anxiety/tearfulness in ICU). The patient denied any suicidal or
homicidal ideation. The patient will follow up with her
outpatient psychiatric provider.

4. Polysubstance abuse. Patient admitted to nicotine only
currently. In the ICU, she has also been monitored on a CIWA
protocol for question of ETOH abuse with prn Valium for
agitation (agitation also thought to be secondary to
prednisone). At the time of discharge, she was interested in
quitting smoking. She was discharged on nicotine patches and she
was already on Wellbutrin. The patient was instructed not to
smoke with a patch or while wearning the oxygen.

5. Left adrenal incidentaloma, 1.7 X 2.1cm. This was found
incidentally on chest CT which extended into the upper abdomen.
The need for outpatient follow up was discussed with the
patient.

The patient's code status was FULL CODE during this admission.
