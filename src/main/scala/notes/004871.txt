Pertinent Results:
[**2110-3-4**] Carotid U/S: There is mild homogeneous calcified plaque
at the carotid bifurcations bilaterally, but no evidence of a
hemodynamically significant stenosis. Flow in the vertebral
arteries is prograde.
.
[**2110-3-6**] ECHO PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection
is seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at
time of study.
POST-CPB: The left ventricular systolic function remains normal,
estimated EF>55%. The RV systolic function remains normal. The
mitral regurgitation remains mild to moderate. Other valve
function remains unchanged. There is no evidence of dissection.
.
[**2110-3-9**] Chest X-ray: A tiny pneumothorax suggested on the films
dated [**2110-3-8**] at 10 a.m. is not distinctly visualized on the
current exam and has likely resolved. No other evidence for
pneumothorax is identified. There are small bilateral effusions
seen posteriorly and slight blunting of the right costophrenic
angle. There is minimal plate-like atelectasis and some patchy
retrocardiac density, which has improved in the interim. Minimal
plate-like atelectasis at the left base is new.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but slightly
improved.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips noted. There
is upper zone re-distribution, without other evidence of CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2110-3-4**] for further
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner including a carotid ultrasound
which showed no evidence of a hemodynamically significant
stenosis. Heparin was started given his significant disease and
coronary anatomy. On [**2110-3-6**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to four vessels. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He remained on Neo through POD #1 this
was weaned off by POD#2 and he was started on low dose
lopressor. He transferred to floor for further care. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. While on
the telemetry floor he continued to make good progress and
worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility. On
post-op day four he was discharged home with VNA services with
the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
