History of Present Illness:
82 year-old woman with CAD s/p NSTEMI [**5-19**] managed medically,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, [**Hospital 15134**]
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] [**2103-6-15**] after presenting there
with progressive exertional dyspnea, 5-lb weight gain,
orthopnea, leg swelling, and cough productive of white sputum.
Her ECG showed lateral ST depressions, CXR showed mild CHF, and
labs showed hyponatremia (Na 130), acute renal failure (Cr 3.9,
baseline 2.2), TropI 1.04, and Hct 25. She was transfused 1 unit
PRBC for anemia. Guaiac negative, so she was given ASA, Plavix
load, Lasix 120 mg, Heparin gtt, nitropaste, and Mucomyst and
was transferred for possible cardiac catheterization. She had a
5 L/min O2 requirement upon transfer.

Serial CK were flat and troponin levels remained stable ~0.4 (Cr
~4.0). Nonetheless, she was treated with heparin gtt x 48 hours
for possible acute coronary syndrome leading to decompensated
heart failure. She was started on Lasix gtt and metolazone upon
arrival here but did not display adequate urine output. TTE
showed EF 45% with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis,
mildly dilated RV with borderline normal free wall function, 1+
AI, 2+ MR, and moderate pulmonary HTN. Nephrology was consulted
for management of volume status in the setting of acute on
chronic renal failure - they felt that hypoxemia did not
correlate to volume status and recommended discontinuing
diuresis. She was started on vancomycin+ceftazidime for right
lower lobe hospital-acquire pneumonia and UTI. She received an
extra dose of Klonopin on the evening of HD #2. The morning of
HD #3, she was more delirious and hypoxemic, with O2 sat 85% on
5 L/min (ABG 7.34/34/96/23) and was transferred to the CCU. CXR
showed progression of pulmonary edema. Oxygenation requirement
improved to 3 L/min NC without diuresis, and CXR [**6-17**] showed
improvement in pulmonary edema. Urine output 600 cc since
midnight, negative 700 cc since arrival in CCU. Metoprolol was
changed to carvedilol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], increased hydralazine to 30
mg q8h. Patient was then transferred back to the [**Hospital1 1516**] Cardiology
Service.

ECG [**2103-6-15**]  6:58:18 PM
Sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia. Q-T interval is prolonged
for rate. Extensive ST-T wave abnormalities. Cannot rule out
myocardial ischemia.  Clinical correlation and repeat tracing
are suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CXR [**2103-6-15**]
There are no old films available for comparison. The heart is
upper limits of normal in size. There is bilateral lower lobe
volume loss with probable infiltrate as well on the right. There
is some mild pulmonary vascular redistribution.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe volume loss with right lower
lobe infiltrate. The overall appearance is worrisome for an
infectious process rather than pulmonary edema.

CXR [**2103-6-19**]
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**2103-6-17**].
There is interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions. The
patient is in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema that appears to
be unchanged since the prior study. Bibasilar retrocardiac
opacities are most likely consistent with areas of atelectasis.

Echocardiogram [**2103-6-16**]
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is elongated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with inferior
and infero-lateral hypokinesis suggested. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Renal ultrasound [**2103-6-18**]
There is cortical thinning involving the kidneys bilaterally. No
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis is seen. The right kidney
measures 10.0 cm in size, and the left kidney measures 7.3 cm in
size. A Foley catheter is in place
