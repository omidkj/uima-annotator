Admission Date:  [**2201-1-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2201-1-28**]

Date of Birth:              Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Acute renal failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   [**Known lastname 14537**] is a 48 year old
African-American female with severe hypertension recently
diagnosed with diastolic dysfunction and heart failure,
chronic renal insufficiency, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] between [**12-12**] until [**2201-1-2**], for pulmonary edema and uncontrolled hypertension.
During that admission, the patient was started on a whole new
regimen of anti-hypertensive pills including Coreg,
Enalapril, Norvasc.  The patient was discharged home on high
doses of these anti-hypertensive medications and was followed
by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3742**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D., as well as Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
the Heart Failure Clinic.

During one of her follow-ups at her Heart Failure Clinic the
patient had labs drawn on [**2201-1-8**].  The results of
these labs revealed an increased creatinine of 3.4, up from a
baseline of 2.5 on [**2201-1-1**].  Between [**2201-1-10**] and [**2201-1-15**], multiple attempts were made to
call the patient to return to the estimated date of delivery
for evaluation of her worsening renal failure.  Unfortunately
the patient's phone line was disconnected at this time.  The
patient incidentally called in to the [**Hospital 191**] Clinic to speak to
her physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3742**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and she was feeling
unwell.  She was told to come straight to the Emergency
Department for examination.

On discussion with that patient it appears that over the week
prior to her current admission, the patient has had increased
nausea, increased lightheadedness, and worsening ankle
swelling.  The patient reported that she had followed a
strict 2 gram salt diet as instructed on the last hospital
discharge and was compliant with all of her medications.  The
patient was noted to be in extreme financial difficulties on
last admission and multiple resources were elicited in an
attempt to help the patient with her financial difficulty and
in coping with her heart failure.  Unfortunately, the
patient's telephone had been disconnected during the early
week of [**Month (only) 1096**].

The patient reported that in the week leading to this current
admission, she had been experiencing increased fatigue and
increased shortness of breath with occasional headaches.  She
had been taking her blood pressure once a day at home and it
remained in the normal range from 100 over 70s and 60s.  She
did, however, notice her urination was decreased from two to
three times a night with her evening Lasix down to once a
night.  The patient had no chest pain, no orthopnea, no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no dysuria and no change in
bowel habits and no vomiting or abdominal pain.  She denied
any fever or chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Recently diagnosed heart failure due to chronic
uncontrolled hypertension.  A recent echocardiogram on
[**12-17**] showed small ASD with some left-to-right shunt,
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a
hyperdynamic left ventricular, ejection fraction greater than
75%, right ventricular hypertrophy, one plus mitral
regurgitation, consistent with hypertrophic hypertensive
heart disease.  Cardiac catheterization on [**12-22**]
revealed right dominant system, severe systolic systemic and
pulmonary hypertension, with an elevated left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure at 33 and no flow limiting renal
artery disease.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease status post left
femoral-popliteal bypass.
3.  Question of history of asthma.
4.  Fibroid uterus status post tubal ligation.
5.  Chronic O2 requirement on home O2 since [**2200-8-3**].
6.  History of positive PPD in [**2195**] with a negative chest
x-ray.
7.  Status post gunshot wound to right arm with foreign body
and metal place in place.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg.
2.  Iron sulfate 325 mg three times a day.
3.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
4.  Norvasc 20 mg two times a day.
5.  Lasix 20 mg two times a day.
6.  Enalapril 20 mg two times a day.
7.  Carvedilol 75 mg two times a day.
8.  Tylenol as needed.
9.  Oxy-Codon as needed.
10. PhosLo two tablets three times a day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to penicillin which gives
her hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is currently applying for SSDI
and SSI as well as Mass Health.  This is mediated by Social
Work from her last admission.  The patient lives with
boyfriend for the past 38 years.  The patient has three or
four grown children.  The patient denies any intravenous drug
use.  Has occasional alcohol use.  Has quit smoking for a few
months.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother died of an myocardial
infarction at age 27.  The patient has two sisters who died
of heart disease in their twenties.  The patient has several
maternal uncles with coronary artery disease and also has a
positive family history in numerous family members.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient had a
temperature of 98.2 F.; heart rate of 58; respiratory rate of
16; blood pressure of 120/60, saturating 89% on two liters
and 94% on four liters.  General examination revealed an
alert and awake woman in no acute distress.  Head, Eye, Ear,
Nose and Throat examination revealed mucous membranes moist
with no icterus.  Of note, on the general examination, the
patient has whole body edema, most markedly in her face and
neck compared to discharge three weeks ago.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI
systolic ejection murmur in right upper sternal border.
There was no jugular venous distention.  Lung examination
revealed minimal rales at both lung bases.  Abdomen
examination revealed a soft nondistended abdomen with minimal
epigastric tenderness and normoactive bowel sounds.  There
was no guarding and no rebound.  Extremities revealed trace
ankle edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  On admission revealed a hematocrit of
32.3, white count of 6.0, and a platelet count of 176.
Differential on her white count revealed 54% neutrophils, 20%
lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 17% eosinophils and 3% basophils.

Serum chemistry revealed a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.7,
chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 32, BUN of 65 and a creatinine
of 3.7.  Blood sugar was 87.

Liver function studies revealed an ALT of 9, AST of 19,
alkaline phosphatase of 97.  Her CK was 55, troponin of less
than 0.3, amylase of 61 and total bilirubin of 0.3.

Urinalysis revealed 30 of protein.  Urine electrolytes
revealed urine sodium of 15, urine creatinine of 118, giving
free urinary sodium excretion of 0.3%.

Chest x-ray on admission revealed congestive heart failure,
slightly worse compared to chest x-ray on [**2200-12-26**].
There were small bilateral pleural effusions.  EKG showed
sinus bradycardia in the 50s, T wave inversion in lead I, AVL
and leads V5 to 6, T-wave flattening in lead V4.  There were
no changes compared to her old EKG on [**2200-12-22**].

COURSE IN HOSPITAL:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
on Cardiology Service for her new acute renal failure likely
secondary to decreased renal perfusion in setting of
over-controlling systemic hypertension.  Upon admission, the
patient's diuretics and ACE inhibitors were discontinued due
to her increased creatinine and worsening renal failure.  Her
Coreg was continued and her blood pressure was continued to
be kept at 110s to 130s range systolic with the use of Coreg.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is the patient's regular nephrologist, was
re-consulted to follow the patient in the setting of acute
renal failure.

Over the two days of [**1-15**] and [**1-16**], the
patient's creatinine continued to worsen to 3.9 on [**2201-1-16**].  At this time, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient's
Cardiologist, brought the patient back to the Catheterization
Laboratory and re-performed a cardiac catheterization.  On
this catheterization, the patient was found
