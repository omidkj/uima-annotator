Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**]
Chief Complaint:
Sob

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
88 yo female with known history of CLL and melanoma complicated
by pleural effusions was recently at rehab for six weeks and was
discharged home 1 week ago. She now presents with increasing SOB
over the past week. Of note she was d/c'd from rehab on [**1-29**] L O2
from rehab but at home has had to increase it to 2L. of note pt
has history of chylous pleural effusion in the past. Pt denies
fevers but admits to yellow productive cough. No chest pain,
orthopnea or PND. IN [**Name (NI) **] pt's vitals were 98.3, 113/61, 67 100%
2L. CXR revealed large increasd L effusion, increasing R
effusion, spiculated unchanged opacity LUL. labs revealed WBC of
14 and Lactate 1.1. cardiac enzymes were negative and ekg
revealed no acute ischemic changes or right heart heart strain.
pt was pancultured and started on vancomycin and levofloxacin
for community acquired, nosocomial and atypical pneumonia. she's
admitted for further management.

Past Medical History:
ONC PMHx:
88 yo female with Hx of CLL, melanoma and bilateral pulmonary
nodules of unclear etiology. The patient had been initially
evaluated at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**9-/2176**] for left inguinal adenopathy,
which was biopsied showing melanoma with unknown primary. At
that time, a peripheral blood smear was also consistent with
CLL. She underwent a femoral lymphadenectomy with a muscle flap

in [**2176-12-27**]. Since that time, she has been followed by
serial PET CT scans for her known CLL and pulmonary nodules.
She has not received any treatment for CLL and was not felt to
be an appropriate candidate for adjuvant therapy for melanoma.

Her most recent PET/CT on 4/41/09 showed moderate-to-large
right-sided pleural effusion as well as an interval increase in

size and FDG avidity of the left upper lobe nodules. She
underwent thoracentesis on [**2179-5-25**] and the effusion was found to

be chylous. The fluid re accumulated and she had underwent RT
VATS, thoracic duct ligation and talc pleurodesis on [**6-23**]. Her
postop course was complicated by a new diagnosis of atrial
fibrillation. She was seen as an outpatient on [**7-19**] complaining

of increasing weakness and shortness of breath. A CT on [**7-19**]
showed moderate bilateral dependent pleural effusions and
multiple loculated collections of pleural fluid in the right
hemithorax. She was admitted for further evaluation and
treatment.

Other PMHx:
Bilateral pulmonary nodules
Recent Dx A fib during last admission in [**6-5**]
CLL
Melanoma
Cataracts
Hypothyroidism following thyroidectomy for goiter.
H. pylori infection in [**2172**].
Vaginal hysterectomy in [**2133**] for fibroids.

Social History:
She is a retired woman who has previously worked as a procedural
analyst for the government.  She has a history of significant
travel including living in [**Last Name (LF) 651**], [**First Name3 (LF) 6171**], [**Country 3992**], and [**Country 3396**],
but her last travel outside of the country may have been in the
late 80s.  She was a past smoker with about a
60-pack-year smoking history and she quit 3 years ago.  She
denies any alcohol use.  She has no known asbestos exposure.


Family History:
Mother has history of lung cancer and she was a nonsmoker, her
maternal aunt who was a smoker, had a history of lung cancer.
Her sister also had a history of lung cancer and there is family
history of second-degree relatives with history of melanoma.

IMAGING:
cxr [**2179-9-26**]:
1. Slight interval increase in size of bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Interstitial opacity within the right lung, particularly
within the right lung base is worrisome for lymphangitic spread
of tumor.
3. Persistent dense consolidation within the retrocardiac region
which could represent atelectasis but infection is not excluded.

4. Unchanged spiculated opacity within the left upper lobe,
which on the prior CT was worrisome for malignancy.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2179-9-27**]
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Increasing moderate left pleural effusion.
3. Increased extent and distribution of lymphangitic
carcinomatosis on the
right, as well as increasing mass lesions in both upper lobes.
4. New small focus of peribronchovascular consolidation in the
right upper
lobe (21, 2), concerning for an early focus of infectious
pneumonia in the
appropriate clinical setting.
5. Unchanged conglomerate central and upper abdominal
lymphadenopathy.

Pleural fluid [**2179-10-1**]: Rare highly atypical epithelioid cells
in a background of mesothelial cells and many lymphocytes,
suspicious for  metastatic melanoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 88 yo woman with history of CLL and
metastatic melanoma, bilateral pleural effusions and possible
lyphangtic spread of malignancy transferred from ICU s/p
thoracentesis and brief BiPAP course with improvement in
respiratory status, now doing well on baseline O2 status at
3LNC.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure/somnolence - resolving with
improvement in ventilation on most recent ABG. Respiratory
failure thought to be combination of HAP, possible worsening
lymphangitic spread of cancer in lung, and baseline COPD.
Resolved with antibiotics over time. However, patient remained
with weak cardiopulmonary fx as would desat to mid 80s on 3LNC.
For this reason, PT recommended inpatient PT to regain
endurance.

# Bacteremia: micrococcus not usually a pathogen. Surveillance
cultures negative. Patient afebrile with no symptoms of systemic
infection. Patient completed 8 day course of vanc and zosyn IV
and did well.

# Bilateral pleural effusions - Pleural fluid exudative,
cytology suspicious for metastatic melanoma, not diagnostic.
Patient felt improved after 1.3L tap in ICU. Pt to f/u with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] re further management of effusions.

# Leukocytosis/CLL - chronically elevated WBC likely [**3-1**] CLL.
Not undergoing tx and WBC is actually lower than previous. No
fevers or other signs of active infection.

# Melanoma - being managed symptomatically. Not felt to be
candidate for adjuvant
