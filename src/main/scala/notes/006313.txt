Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
30 year old female with h/o asthma who presented with
respiratory distress.  She reported one to two weeks of
rhinorrhea and cough productive of clear sputum, as well as
increased wheezing.  She needed an increase in frequency of nebs
at home and was using them every 4 hours.
.
This morning, she presented to her PCP's office with SOB after
waking up feeling acutely worse.  She was found to have an O2
sat of 89%RA and tachycardia to 110.  She was given a set of
nebs and EMS was called.  EMS gave her 125mg IV solumedrol and 2
more nebs.
.
In our ED, initial vitals were HR 104 RR 29 O2 Sat 97%NRB.  She
was reportedly diaphoretic and tripoding with prolonged I/E
ratio with significant wheezing.  She was given continuous
duonebs, 2g IV mag, and Zofran (for nausea).  She was put on
BiPap and felt symptomatically improved with FiO2 100% with
pressure support of 3.  ABG was done while on BiPap which showed
7.15/65/579/24.  She was subsequently intubated due to fatigue.
Also given epinephrine x 1.  Vitals on transfer T 95.0 HR 117 BP
135/84 RR 22 O2 100% on BiPap.  She has 2 PIVs for access.
.
Notably, she had an admission to [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2159**] for similar
symptoms.  At that time she was intubated and was difficult to
ventilate in spite of continuous nebulizers and high-dose
steroids.  She was paralyzed on Nimbex and started on heliox.
She had a bronch that revealed sputum positive for staph and
treated with nafcillin.  She also developed pneuomediastinum and
pneuoperitoneum felt to be [**1-6**] high ventilatory pressures.  She
had a normal esophagogram and her ABGs improved.  She was
extubated 8 days after admission.  She also had sinus
tachycardia with T wave inversions in V5-V6 that were new and EF
showed concentric LVH with EF 40-45% felt to be due to her high
ventilatory pressures and severe asthma exacerbation.

Past Medical History:
Severe Asthma s/p recent intubation [**12/2159**] at [**Hospital1 112**] similar to
this admission, also with intubation at age 18
