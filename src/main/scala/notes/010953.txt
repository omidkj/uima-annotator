EEG [**2154-9-16**]: This is a likely normal portable EEG. No focal,
lateralized, or epileptiform discharges were noted. No seizure
activity
was noted. If clinically warranted, the study could be repeated
during
the more waking state so that transitions in state could be
evaluated.

CXR [**2154-9-16**]: An endotracheal tube terminates with its tip 3
cm above the carina in satisfactory position.  The
cardiomediastinal contour is normal.  Allowing for technique,
the heart is not definitely enlarged.  There is a linear
retrocardiac density and blunting of the left costophrenic angle
likely
