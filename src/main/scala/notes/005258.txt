Chest CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Evaluation for subsegmental emboli is limited due to contrast
timing.
2. Changes of moderate centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe
predominance. No airspace consolidation or pulmonary nodules are
seen.
3. Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
4. Incomplete assessment of a partially imaged possible
pathologically enlarged porta hepatis lymph node. Clinical
correlation and comparison with outside imaging studies is
recommended. If no prior studies are available, follow up with
contrast enhanced abdominal CT should be performed.
.
Renal US:
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 8.1 cm and the left kidney
measures 8.8 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis and no stones or
solid masses are identified on either kidney.  There is a simple
cyst on the right kidney which measures 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm.
Images of the bladder are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  Simple 1.3 cm left renal cyst.  Otherwise,
unremarkable renal
ultrasound.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76 y.o. female with Afib on coumdain, HTN, hyperlipidemia
who presents with URI symptoms and hypoxia.  She subsequently
required an overnight overnight stay in the MICU on hospital day
#2 with worsening respiratory disress, and was found to have +
RSV.  Patient improved with IV steroids but had an ambulatory
oxygen requirement upon d/c.  She is discharged home with 2L
oxygen and pulmonary rehab.
.
# Hypoxia - Initially, CXR neg for pneumonia, CTA neg for PE or
consolidation, but does show evidence of emphysema.  Upon
admission to regular floor patient with increased hypoxia
requiring 6 L of O2 and tachypnea with accessory muscle use.
Patient ABG was 7.29/58/74 on 3L NC. In MICU pt. received IV
methylprednisolone, ipratropium nebs & supplemental 6L O2 with
improvement of hypoxia.  She was transfered back to regular
floor and her RSV antigen returned positive at that time.  Her
wheezing improved on IV steroids and she is discharged on 2
weeks of steroid tapers, along with combivent nebs and advair.
Pt. also completed 5 day course of Azithromycin for COPD
exacerbation.
Diff dx also included CHF, ACS, or blossoming pna. No h/o COPD
but does have 40 pack year smoking hx and mild pulm htn by last
echo.  The CT scan confirmed emphysema and wheezing necessitated
steroids.  She would probably benefit from pulmonary PFTs as
outpatient once improved and pulmonary evaluation. CHF
considered given elevated BNP but pt dry on exam.  Her recent
echo showed nl systolic and diastolic function, but she does
have mild cor pulmonale likely due to pulmonary hypertension.
Her lasix was held while in house as she was dehydrated.  No MI
w/cardiac enzymes WNL.
.
# ARF - Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.2 & without signs of clinical
hypervolemia. Creatine was followed and returned to 0.8 by HD#3.
Pt. was continued on Moexipril after resolution of renal
failure, while continued to hold lasix as pt without signs of
volume overload with likely dehydration.
.
# Afib - Pt. anticoagulated w/ warfarin. Warfarin held on HD#3
as INR 3.9. INR normalized prior to discharge and pt. resumed
warfarin therapy as prior to admission. Pt. continued metoprolol
100mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Hypertension - Pt. remained hypertensive (SBP 130-150's)
throughout admission and was continued on metoprolol, moexipril.
 Her amlodapine is restarted upon discharge.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia - continued Pravastatin
