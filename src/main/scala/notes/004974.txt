PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Sitting up in bed,
declined, denies pain or shortness of breath.  Heart rate 57.
Blood pressure 199/54.  Respiratory rate 14.  O2 sat 98% on 2
liters.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Sclera anicteric.  Oropharynx with mucous membranes moist.
Neck supple with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  No JVD.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac regular
rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  4/6 systolic ejection murmur
like a washing machine.  Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender,
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities were
without edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurological awake,
lucid, able to communicate in broken English.  Moves all
extremities without focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.2, hematocrit
36.1, platelets 192, sodium 131, potassium 3.4, chloride 92,
CO2 31, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 318.  PT 12.3, PTT
27.1, INR 1.0.  Electrocardiogram rate of 53 in sinus rhythm,
left axis deviation with a long QT of .456, peak T waves in
V1-3, elevated J point in V2 and 3.  Chest x-ray showed low
lung volumes, no congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Service for anginal workup and rule out myocardial
infarction.  The Cardiology Service was consulted and on
[**2-9**] the patient was brought to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory.  Please see the catheterization
report for full details.  In summary, the patient was found
to have no significant disease of the left anterior
descending coronary artery or circumflex and right coronary
artery with a 70% stenosis and an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm
squared.  Following catheterization CT Surgery was consulted
and the patient was seen and accepted for aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting times one.
On [**2-10**] the patient was brought to the Operating Room.
 Please see the Operating Room report for full details. In
summary the patient had an aortic valve replacement with a
#19 Mosaic porcine valve and coronary artery bypass grafting
times one with a saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery.  The patient's bypass time was
131 minutes with a cross clamp time of 96 minutes.  She
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer the patient's mean arterial pressure was
86 with a CVP of 13.  She was AV paced at a rate of 89 beats
per minute.  She had Propofol at 10 mcs per kilogram per
minute as well as a neo-synephrine drip to support her blood
pressure.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was successfully weaned
from the ventilator and successfully extubated.  She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the day of surgery.  On
postoperative day one the patient continued to do well.  She
was weaned from all vaso active intravenous infusions.  Her
Swans-Ganz catheter was removed as well as her chest tubes.
She was begun on beta blockers as well as diuretics.  On
postoperative day two the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  She was restarted on her
preoperative antidepressants and on postoperative day three
the patient was transferred to the floor for continuing
postoperative care and acardiac rehabilitation.  Over the
next several days the patient had an uneventful
hospitalization.  With the assistance of the nursing staff
and physical therapy staff her activity was gradually
increased.  On postoperative day four her temporary pacing
wires and central venous access were removed and on
postoperative day five it was decided that she would be ready
for transfer to rehabilitation for continuing cardiac
rehabilitation and postoperative care.  On postoperative day
six the patient was transferred to rehabilitation.

At the time of dictation the patient's physical examination
is as follows, vital signs temperature 98, heart rate 70
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 128/52, respiratory rate 18, O2
sat 97% on room air.  Weight preoperatively 67 kilograms at
discharge 68.1 kilograms.  Laboratory data white blood cell
count 5.3, hematocrit 27.4, platelets 179, sodium 141,
potassium 4.7, chloride 105, CO2 29, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8,
glucose 251.  Neurological alert and oriented times three,
moves all extremities, follows commands, respiratory clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac regular rate and rhythm.
S1 and S2. Sternum is stable.  Incision with staples open to
air, clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well
perfuse with trace edema.  Right saphenous vein graft site
with Steri-Strips open to air clean and dry.

bypass grafting times one with a saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery.
2.  Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement with
a #19 Mosaic porcine valve.
