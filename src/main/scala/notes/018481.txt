Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 29878**] is an 83 year old femaile who was admitted from
[**Hospital6 **] for increasing hip pain after being
discharged on [**6-20**] for a presumed left hip infection, washout
and hemiarthroplasty.  Mrs.  [**Known lastname 29878**] had numberous cultures
drawn from her wound, but they never grew out anything.  The
patient was discharged to her rehab center on lovenox and her
previous meds.  She was then admitted for this hospital stay on
[**2181-6-28**].  She was brought to the OR on [**2181-6-28**] for I&D of her left
hip and a large hematoma was evacuated and a surface VAC was
placed.  On POD1 the patient was restarted on lovenox and home
medications.  The VAC produced 200-300cc of serosangous drainage
per day and as a result was brought back to the OR on [**7-2**] for
another washout and surface VAC placement.  During her
procedures, intra-op cultures were drawn but all returned
negative.  The infectious disease team was consulted and her
medications were adjusted.  It was felt taht dispite the
negative cultures, we would aggresively treat this as an
infection due to the high suspicion and aftermath of a missed
infection.  The wound continued to drain a large amount of
serosangous fluid and on [**7-7**] the orthopaedic team decided to
stop the patient's lovenox and begin the patient on low dose
coumadin with an INR goal of 1.3-1.5 for DVT prophylaxis.  On
[**7-9**] the wound had completely stopped draining and she was felt
stable to return to the rehab center.  She is being discharged
today back to her nursing home in stable condition.
