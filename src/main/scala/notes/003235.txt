- UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2187-2-17**] 3:48 PM
FINDINGS: Color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. There
was normal flow, augmentation, and waveforms demonstrated. There
was no intraluminal thrombus identified. Due to the patient body
habitus, compression images of the common and superficial
femoral arteries could not be obtained.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis. Somewhat limited study.

- RADIOLOGY  TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) RIGHT  [**2187-2-17**]
FINDINGS: There is a marked soft tissue edema and density, in
the proximal right lower extremity. There is no gas noted in the
subcutaneous tissue. There is no sign of fracture or dislocation
or degenerative change. There is no underlying cortical
reaction. There are no radiopaque foreign bodies.
IMPRESSION: Marked density and edema of soft tissues of the
proximal right lower extremity. Please note that absence of gas
does not rule out necrotizing fasciitis.

- RADIOLOGY  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2187-2-17**]
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lung volumes are low.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no evidence
of central lymphadenopathy. Lungs are clear, with the exception
of bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion.
Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process

- RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-2-18**]
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance to the chest with no acute process
seen.

- RENAL U.S.  [**2187-2-18**]
FINDINGS: Study is very limited secondary to large body habitus.
The left kidney measures 11.9 cm. The right kidney measures 10.7
cm. No hydronephrosis identified within the kidneys. No definite
mass lesion or stones identified.
IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to increased body habitus.
No hydronephrosis identified and no definite mass lesion or
renal stones identified.

- LUNG SCAN  [**2187-2-19**]
INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol
in 8 views
demonstrate mild decrease in tracer uptake in the posterobasilar
segment of the right lower lobe. Perfusion images in the same 8
views show a matched defect in the posterior right lower lobe.
No other perfusion defects are identified.
Chest x-ray shows an air space opacity in the right lower lobe
corresponding to the area of matched tracer defect.
IMPRESSION: Decreased perfusion and ventilation in the posterior
right lower lobe corresponding to an infiltrate on CXR. These
findings would be entirely compatible with air space disease,
but in the face of CXR findings, the possibility of pulmonary
embolism can not be fully excluded. No other segmental perfusion
defects are present.

- BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2187-2-19**]
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Compared to DVT study of
just two days prior. Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] were
performed of the bilateral lower extremity veins including the
greater saphenous, common femoral, superficial femoral,
popliteal, and deep tibial veins. Venous structures demonstrate
normal compression, flow, waveforms, and augmentation without
intraluminal thrombus. Note is made of large right groin lymph
nodes measuring up to 2.8 cm in long axis, demonstrating a
benign-appearing fatty hila, likely reactive given history of
cellulitis.
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of DVT.
2) Right groin adenopathy, likely reactive.

- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-2-19**]
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is a new area of faint
opacity within the right lower lobe in comparison to the prior
study. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The
remainder of lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary vascular
congestion. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax seen.
IMPRESSION: New faint opacity in the right lower lobe may
represent an area of aspiration and/or consolidation.
