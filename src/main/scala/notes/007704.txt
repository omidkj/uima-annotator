RENAL U.S.

COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen dated [**2110-12-2**].

RENAL [**Month/Day/Year **]: The right kidney measures 10.1 cm. The left
kidney measures 11.2 cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stone or
solid renal mass identified. There are a couple of simple renal
cysts of the left kidney, the largest of which is at the upper
pole, measuring up to 4.0 cm in largest diameter. The bladder is
collapsed.

IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Left renal cysts.

TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *47 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)
Pericardium - Effusion Size: 2.8 cm

INTERPRETATION:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). False LV tendon (normal variant).


RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Significant PR. The end-diastolic PR velocity is increased c/w
PA diastolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Large pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. No
significant respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
flows.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Conclusions:

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chambersize and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic
hypertension. There is a large, circumferential, echolucent
pericardial
effusion extending 2-2.8cm around the right and left ventricles.
There is mild right ventricular diastolic invagination, but no
respiratory accentuation of transmitral E wave velocity.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2109-6-13**], the size of the pericardial effusion
is larger, and mild right ventricular diastolic collapse is now
seen.

Based on [**2102**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings  indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions  regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and  echocardiographic
data.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS

CT ANGIOGRAM:

Atheromatous plaque along the normal caliber included portion of
the lower descending thoracic aorta, the upper abdominal aorta
is normal in caliber measuring 2.3 cm. The common hepatic and
splenic arteries have separate origins.

Interval Endo stent repair of the infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm with the stent graft extending from less than 1 cm
above the origin of the renal arteries,both of which are patent.
The stented aorta measures less than 2 cm AP at the level of the
renal artery origins.
No evidence of endoleak. The infrarenal aneurysm sac at its
largest measures up to 5.1 cm AP x 5 cm transverse (series 3A,
image 93). Distal stent limbs extend to the mid right common
iliac and distal left common iliac artery. Both internal and
external iliac arteries are normal in caliber and patent. Minor
retrograde filling of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] noted.

CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

Large pericardial effusion measuring up to 4 cm in depth (larger
than on the prior CT of [**2110-7-25**]). Small bibasilar pleural
effusions, left lower lobe collapse and partial atelectasis of
the posterior right lower lobe.

Nasogastric tube in situ with the tip lying in the nondistended
gastric body. The liver, spleen, pancreas, both adrenal glands
appear normal. A small amount of free intraabdominal fluid
mainly along the right pericolic gutter and mild circumferential
thickening of the gallbladder wall. These findings with the
appearances of the lung base may be secondary to cardiac
congestion, for example.
No intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Some vicarious
excretion of contrast noted within the gallbladder.

Some residual contrast noted in both kidneys on enhanced CT
following recent angiography. Both kidneys show symmetric
post-contrast enhancement. Hyopattenuating, partially exophytic
renal cortical cyst arising from the left upper pole medially
measures up to 3.9 cm.

No abnormal large bowel loop dilatation or focal segmental
stricture to strongly suggest ischemic bowel on the CT.

CT SCAN OF PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

No free pelvic fluid. Urinary catheter within the bladder, which
is empty at the time of scanning.

No bone lesions demonstrated. Degenerative change noted in the
lumbar spine with moderate lumbar scoliosis convexed to the left
side.

CONCLUSION:

1. No abnormal bowel loop dilatation or segmental thickening to
strongly suggest bowel ischemia on the current CT. Celiac and
superior mesenteric artery are widely patent.

2. Interval Endo stent repair of the infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm. No evidence of endoleak.
