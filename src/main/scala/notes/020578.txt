CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  82-year-old non-diabetic white
female with coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2124-11-24**], hypertension, had an endovascular
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2125-11-24**].  Routine follow-up CT scan done on [**2126-5-13**] showed the
presence of an endo-leak.  The patient was asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable.

On the morning of [**2126-5-16**], the patient became dizzy at 6 A.M.
when she awoke and went to the bathroom.  While sitting down,
she felt like the room was spinning.  She did not move her
bowels.  This weakness and dizziness lasted approximately 15
to 20 minutes.  She denied chest pain, diaphoresis, or
abdominal pain.  There was no shortness of breath, no nausea
or vomiting, and no loss of consciousness.  The patient
returned to bed, but still felt a persistent weakness.  She
presented to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 190**] for evaluation.

A repeat CT scan in the Emergency Room showed no evidence of
rupture or retroperitoneal hematoma.  The area of the known
endo-leak was the same diameter.  Her hematocrit was
unchanged at 35.

Vascular Surgery was consulted.  The decision was made to
admit the patient to the Medical service to rule out
myocardial infarction.  Angiography of the endograft was
scheduled for the following morning.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 8.7, hematocrit 35.3,
platelets 177,000.  PT 13.4, PTT 27.7, INR 1.2.  Sodium 142,
potassium 3.7, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 22,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 113.  Electrocardiogram showed a
normal sinus rhythm in the 60s, poor R wave progression, no
change from previous electrocardiogram in [**2125-4-24**].  CT of
the abdomen on [**2126-5-13**] showed an endo-leak at the proximal
aspect of the stent in the abdominal aorta.  Aneurysm 5.4 x
5.2 cm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
on the Medical service.  Abdominal aortogram was scheduled
for the following morning.  Just before midnight on the night
of admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain.  Her
blood pressure fell to 60, with a heart rate between 150 to
160.  Her hematocrit had dropped from 35 to 25.  Ultrasound
done at the bedside showed a small amount of fluid around the
aorta.  The patient underwent an emergent repair of her
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with an aortobi-iliac
graft and removal of the endograft.  Her abdominal incision
was left open, and two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were left in
place.  Estimated blood loss was between 2 and 3 liters.  The
patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells
intraoperatively.

The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit, intubated, paralyzed, and sedated.  Extended intubation
was expected because of the open abdominal wound.

The patient was maintained on Kefzol while her abdomen was
open.  She was started on total parenteral nutrition.  She
was hypotensive and required pressor support.  She developed
thrombocytopenia with platelets as low as 72,000.  Heparin
was discontinued until the patient was determined to be HIT
negative, and then subcutaneous heparin was resumed.  The
patient was diuresed with intravenous lasix.

Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**], General Surgery, was consulted for future
abdominal wound closure.  Partial closure of the abdominal
wound with Silastic mesh was done on [**2126-5-23**].  The
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were left in place.  On [**2126-5-28**], a
fascial closure of the abdominal wound was done after
excision of the mesh secondary to fibropurulent peritonitis.
Normal saline wet-to-dry dressings were ordered for the
incision, which has been healing well.

Postoperatively, the patient developed leukocytosis with a
white count of 20,000.  The culture of the line tip grew
Enterococcus.  Kefzol was changed to ampicillin.  However,
the sputum culture grew Serratia, and the patient was started
on ceftazidime and vancomycin for seven days.  The patient's
white count decreased, however, she had another spike to
20,000 on [**2126-6-1**].  Infectious Disease was consulted, and
concluded that the patient had Serratia peritonitis.  They
recommended stopping the vancomycin after seven days if the
patient remained afebrile.  They recommended extending
treatment with ceftazidime for a total of 14 days.

Because of the patient's open abdominal wound, she remained
intubated, paralyzed, and sedated for an extended period of
time.  On [**2126-5-29**], paralysis was discontinued.  However, she
still remained sedated.  On [**2126-6-1**], sedation was stopped and,
on [**2126-6-3**], the patient was extubated.  The patient managed
to avoid a tracheostomy, which had been considered earlier.

Because of the patient's peritonitis and abdominal wound, the
patient was not a candidate for a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy.  Therefore, a Dobbhoff nasogastric catheter was
placed, and total parenteral nutrition was transitioned over
to tube feedings.  The patient attained her goal of 75
cc/hour, which is cycled between 6 P.M. and 8 A.M.  Tube
feedings consist of the Promote with fiber at full strength.
Her residuals are checked every four hours, and feedings are
held for a residual of greater than 150 cc.

The patient was transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit to the Vascular Intermediate Care Unit on [**2126-6-7**].  A
Speech and Swallow consult was requested.  A modified barium
swallow was done on [**2126-6-11**], which showed no aspiration.
However, the patient was at high risk for aspiration and
pureed diet with honey-thick liquids and strict aspiration
precautions was recommended.  The patient started a trial of
eating on [**2126-6-12**].  She complained of some abdominal pain and
cramping.  The KUB was unremarkable.  A C. difficile culture
was sent off.  This came back positive for C. difficile.  She
was started on a ten day course of Flagyl.

Her white count again went up to 19.4, but the patient
remained afebrile.  Her blood cultures are negative to date.
Her urine culture grew greater than 100,000 yeast.  The Foley
catheter is still in place because the patient is being
diuresed.  Further treatment of
