Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
elective intubation [**2152-9-26**]

History of Present Illness:
77 YO old male with PMH significant for DM, HTN, high chol, CAD
s/p stents [**2150**], CHF, Afib s/p PPM [**2150**], CKD who presents to ED
because of weakness and collapse at home. Patient was found on
admission to be febrile, tachypneic with RUL pneumonia on chest
film. Patient complained of chronic cough with increasing sputum
production.  He denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath,
chest pain.  He denies any loss of consciousness or head trauma
with falls.  Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or changes in
function.  Denies any weight loss or changes in eating habits.
No abd pain/n/v/d.  No choking on food reported.

Patient was admitted and started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for CAP which was then changed to Levoflox and Flagyl as CXR
showed ? evidence for aspiration PNA. The patient since
admission has remained tachypneic and hypoxic requiring O2
today. He needed a non-rebreather for some time but has since
been titrated down. As the patient additionally has a history of
CHF, a repeat chest film was performed to evaluate for any
component of congestion. Although the film did not appear to be
all that congested, the patient's pneumonia appeared to worsen,
now a multilobar pneumonia involving the right upper and
middle/lower lung fields.  ABG 7.43/37/54 at time of transfer to
ICU, he received 80 mg of Lasix with minimal urinary output
after 20 mg caused 250 cc of urine output earlier in the day.
Albuterol nebs with minimal improvement in O2 sat.  Pt was
x-ferred to ICU and started on BiPAP.  See additional course
below.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  77 year old male with hx of HTN, high chol, CAD, afib s/p
pacer here with lobar PNA.
.
1. Respiratory Distress: Initially, the patient was started on
ceftriaxone and azithro for CAP but Abx were adjusted to
levoflox/flagyl based on patient's continued hypoxia and CXR
[**Location (un) 1131**] concerning for aspiration event. The patient became more
distressed with his respiratory state over the first 3 days of
his hospitalization.  It was felt that the most likely source of
his resp distress was thought to be his RUL pneumonia, perhaps
with contribution from his diastolic CHF.  PE was considered but
felt to be very low suspicion given XRAY findings, febrile
state.  Although the film did not appear to be all that
congested, the patient's pneumonia appeared to worsen to a
multilobar pneumonia involving the right upper and middle/lower
lung fields. The patient was found to be dangerously hypoxic on
[**2152-9-25**] with increasing work of breathing. ABG 7.43/37/54 at
that time, patient received 80 mg of IV Lasix with minimal
urinary output.  Albuterol nebs resulted in minimal improvement
in O2 sat. Pt was x-ferred to ICU and started on BiPAP.  He was
intubated [**2152-9-26**] due to continued respiratory distress (it was
a difficult intubation).  His Abx was adjusted again to include
Vancomycin and levofloxacin to cover MRSA and CAP.  Despite no
cx data, it was felt the patient most likely had strep pneum.
pneumonia due to clinical course.  The pateint was liberated
from ventilator slowly due to difficult airway issues and he was
extubated on [**10-2**].  His sputum culture from BAL on [**9-28**] showed
1000 oropharyngeal flora; all other cultures were negative.
Serial CXRs showed clearing of pneumonia. He was transferred to
the floor on 4L NC on [**2152-10-3**].  He maintained excellent O2 sats
and he was weaned to 2L upon discharge.  He has been
intermittently diuresed with Lasix (20mg IV), but his CXRs have
not shown congestion and the course of his respiratory status
has closely followed that of his pneumonia. He has also received
albuterol and atrovent nebs with improvement in his wheeze and
dyspena. He has completed 12 days of Vancomycin and
levofloxacin, and they were continued upon discharge to finish a
14 day course for ? pneumococcal vs staph aureus pneumonia.  The
patient was given pneumococcal vaccine prior to discharge.  No
blood cx were positive.
.
2. CAD: His EKG showed a paced rhythm and old LBBB. He was
without chest pain and had no signs of ischemia throughout his
stay.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out the possibility
of silent ischemia, and were negative.  He was maintained on his
ASA, BB, and statin.  An outpatient echocardiogram may be
considered for future management.

3. HTN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on metoprolol, [**
