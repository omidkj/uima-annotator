History of Present Illness:
64 yo male with esophageal cancer s/p XRT, on chemo, presented
to the ED with complaint of coffee-ground emesis 3x over the
past 2 days. He had last chemo dose on Monday and had a week of
his usual post-chemo fatigue. He had significant epistaxis the
night prior to vomiting that required packing. Also complained
of diarrhea, but denies melena. Had complained of some abdominal
pain. He did endorse lightheadedness and dizziness. Throughtout
ED course, compained of abdominal pain, and wife noted he had
some ectopy on his tele. He denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, or palpatations.
Approx 5 hours after arriving in the ED, patient developed
V-tach that progressed to V-fib per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) **]
attending note. Vitals had been stable until that time except
for a temp of 101.7. Patient was shocked at 200 and returned to
paced (baseline) rhythm, pulse returned. He was breathing
spontaneously, but was intubated for airway protection. OG tube
placed, no red blood on lavage, no coffee-grounds were noted.
Patient was fighting the tube, and was sedated. Patient was
dosed with protonix, cefepime, vancomycin. Lidocaine gtt was
started. Norepinephrine started for BP support.
.
Of note, patient had been using MagicMouth for esophageal
discomfort. He was more fatigued, but this was normal for his
chemo. The epistaxis was also not atypical. Recently, his ace
and BB were discontinued.

Echo [**2133-12-15**]:
LV EF 35% mod dilated LV,
RV: dilated RV, depressed fxn. TR gradient 50
Valves: 2+MR, 2+TR, traace AR
CXR: : A left-sided pacemaker is seen with lead in unchanged
position. The patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy

wires are visualized. A right-sided subclavian catheter
terminates in the cavoatrial junction. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable with a large left atrial shadow. Again
noted is left-sided pleural thickening and adjacent parenchymal
scarring. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung
is clear. There is a small left pleural effusion. There is no
evidence of free air underneath the hemidiaphragms.
.
KUB: Air is noted in the rectum and sigmoid colon. There is no
evidence of acute obstruction. Surgical clips are noted in the
left groin. The osseous structures are unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo male with esophageal cancer, one week after his last
chemo, who presented with coffee-grounds emesis after having
significant epistaxis requiring packing. While in the ED,
patient had a VT/VF arrest that resolved after one shock, and
remained hypotensive thereafter.

1. VT/VF arrest:
The pt was found in the ED to be unresponsive with a rapid heart
rhythm that was assessed by the ED physicians to be V-tach vs
VF. There were no ECG rhythm strips recorded for review. The pt
was cardioverted, and he rapidly regained awareness. Patient is
at risk for VT/VF with his hx of CHF as well as prior CAD. He
was started on a lidocaine drip at 30ug/kg per min for
suppression of VT, which was continued on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
The pt was evaluated by cardiology in the ED who agreed that he
had a possible episode of VF and that lido vs amio could be
continued initially. Given that there were no recurrent events,
lidocaine was discontinued on the following day.  It was likely
that sepsis was the precipitating event. EP consulted, and they
recommended starting on amiodarone.  This was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient's cardiologist.  The patient tolerated
amiodarone loading, and he had no further events on telemetry.

2. Septic Shock:
Patient bordering on neutropenia. Pt was febrile to 102 in ED,
with increased neutrophil predominance, immunosuppressed, and
ANC ~600. His lactate level was 3.0 (after VF and shock). He was
pan-cultured, started on vanc/cefepime, and arrived to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
on levophed in addition to the lidocaine drip.  He was weaned
off pressors quickly, and all culture data were negative with
the exception of sputum gram stain which showed 4+GNR, 4+GPC.
His antibiotics were changed to cefpodoxime to complete a 14 day
course for a likely respiratory infection.

3. Respiratory Failure: Intubated for airway protection, and
weaned from supplemental O2 prior to discharge.

4. GI bleed/hematemesis: Likely this was from large epistaxis
the night prior to presentation and did not represent GI bleed.
However, he is at risk for bleed given esophageal cancer/xrt. OG
tube had a negative lavage, no sign of melena. Vitals were
stable on presentation to ED for the first 5 hours. Hct trended
down from ~30 to 23.3 during his hospital course, and he was
guaiac positive, though he had no gross blood loss since ICU
admission. INR was 5.3, and he was reversed with 3 U FFP and
transfused 2U pRBC in setting of CAD and recent VT event.  His
Hct stabilized, and coumadin was restarted.

5. CHF EF 35%: Pt was recently taken off ACE and BB as
outpatient because bp was too tenuous.  He was diuresed with
transfusions.

6. CAD s/p CABG:  He had no current evidence of active ischemia,
and ruled out by enzymes.  Aspirin not given due to low platelet
counts, and statin started.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], who is aware of these issues.

7. Esophageal cancer: Last cpt dose was one week prior to
presentation. Follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**].

8. CRI: Baseline cr 1.7; continued epo.

9. Diabetes: NPH 9u Qam, RISS.

10. Aortic valve replacement: Pt has St. Jude's valve with high
risk for clot and requiring anti-coagulation.  INR elevated, and
he was reversed with FFP.  Restarted coumadin for goal INR >2.5
