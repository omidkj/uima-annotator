History of Present Illness:
64 yo female, h/o metastatic breast cancer, presenting with new
onset LE edema.  She was first diagnosed with her disease in the
summer of [**2102**] where she had a mammogram showing suspicious
microcalcifications in her left breast.  At 6 month follow up,
the mammogram showed worsening of the calcifications, and she
underwent a stereotactic biopsy.  She also had nipple discharge
at this time and underwent bilateral ductograms.  Pathology was
consistent with invasive ductal cancer, poorly differentiated,
with DCIS, ER/PR negative.  Of the ducts evaluated, they were
consistent with papillomata.  She eventually underwent
mastectomy of the left breast with axillary dissection. She then
had adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of Cytoxan, adriamycin, and
taxol (her last taxol was [**11-10**]).  In [**1-10**], she had a CT that
showed at least 6 brain mets, and she had a short course of XRT
at that time (5 days of Rx).  Since that time, she has been
receiving Herceptin (has had 2 doses thus far, most recent dose
[**2105-2-27**]). Recent CT of the chest showed probable liver mets with
a stable appearance of her left lung  (post-xrt changes). CT of
the brain on [**2105-2-20**] showed multiple enhancing masses, the most
prominent in the left cerebellar region.

For the past 2 weeks, she has been having LE edema.  She was
initially evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**3-6**] who thought
the edema could be due to Herceptin (uncommon side effect) vs.
CHF.  She was started on Lasix, advised to eat a low salt diet,
and she was instructed to return to clinic in 1 week.  When she
presented to clinic today, her LE edema was markedly worse, and
she was also lethargic and confused.  She denies any
SOB/CP/abdominal pain/blood in urine stool/dysuria/hematuria.
She does report subjective chills today (no temperature taken).
On presentation to clinic, she had a low grade fever, and when
she got up to the floor, her temperature was 101.4.  Her LDH was
elevated as well.  Chest X-ray was unchanged from prior (no pna,
no effusion, edema, or infiltrate), and bilateral LE US were
negative for DVT.  She presents for further management and work
up of her fever and change in mental status.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LE edema: there are several possible etiologies for this LE
edema.  This can be a side effect of her Herceptin therapy (not
extremely common as per primary oncologist).  She was tried on
Lasix without effect.  US was negative for DVT.  Other possible
causes include heart failure; she had a normal TTE in [**3-13**], but
it is possible she has developed systolic/diastolic dysfunction
in the interim (can also be a side effect of herceptin).
Although her lungs show no evidence of edema, she could have
right-sided failure accounting for her peripheral edema.  Other
etiologies to consider include infection, obstruction of the
vessels draining her lower extremities.  Initially, she was
hemodynamically stable and started on Levofloxacin for ?UTI (she
was febrile on admission).  Overnight, she became less
responsive, hypotensive, and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
?sepsis.  She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics from
presumed sepsis from RLE cellulitis, fluid resuscitated, on
pressors, and started on stress dose steroids (completed a 5-day
course).  Dermatology was consulted regarding LE cellulitis and
recommended covering for pseudomonas given the appearance
(?echthyma gangrenosum), so she was changed to Vancomycin/Zosyn.
 She improved on this regimen, became hemodynamically stable,
and was transferred back to the floor.  Aggressive diuresis was
continued on the floor (she was grossly volume overloaded s/p
fluid resuscitation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]).  ID was consulted for the LE
cellulitis and recommended better wound care, better glycemic
control, continued antibiotics.  Plain film of the RLE was
without evidence of osteomyelitis.  Her LE edema and cellulitis
slowly improved with this care, and she was continued on
Zosyn/vanco until discharge.  She was discharged on
Augmentin/Levofloxacin, to finish a 14 day course of antibiotics
(or until cellulitis resolved).

TTE in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] revealed new MR and right sided failure.  This
was likely a contributing factor to her new onset LE edema. The
etiology of this new heart failure was not determined (unlikely
to have been solely the effect of her Herceptin therapy).  TTE
was rechecked prior to discharge and found to be back to her
baseline with improvement in biventricular function and no
valvular abnormalities.  She was discharged on 80 mg PO Lasix
with potassium supplementation. This lasix will need to be
tapered as her edema resolves, and her Potassium will need to be
monitored given this lasix therapy.  Repeat TTE prior to
discharge showed resolution of the MR and new right-sided
failure.

2.  Lethargy/Delta MS: According to her family, she has been
progressively lethargic this week and is confused as compared to
her baseline.  Her mental status improved after she was treated
for her sepsis.  It was likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
infection, hypotension, and sepsis.  She was back to her
baseline at the time of discharge.

3.  Inflammatory Breast Cancer: she is s/p mastectomy, XRT to
brain, chemotherapy, and is currently on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] therapy
with Herceptin.  Her Herceptin therapy was held in-house
secondary to her new heart failure.  She was started on
Arimidex, continued on her Decadron (after completing 5-day
course of stress dose steroids) and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in oncology clinic).  Staging bone scan was obtained in-house
showing increased uptake at multiple levels in the T-spine, but
no other areas of probable metastatic disease.  A slow taper of
her Decadron was started in-house (taper by 1 mg, every four
days).  She was started on 1 mg qam, 2mg qhs on [**3-23**] and then
discharged on 1 mg [**Hospital1 **].  The need for further decadron treatment
will be determined by her primary oncologist.  She was
discharged only on Arimidex, and she will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] who will determine the possibility of further chemotherap
