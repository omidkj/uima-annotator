Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76-year-old female with CAD, paroxsymal atrial fibrillation, DM,
COPD of home 02 and chronic prednisone, cor pulmonale, AAA
repair transferred from OSH on [**2174-9-20**] with abdominal pain and
hypotension. She was admitted to the vascular service for
concern of rectus sheath hematoma. Surgery did not feel that AAA
graft was infected. CTA showed retroperitoneal bleed without
active extravasation (Hct was 33 on admission and nadired to
24). Hct now stable after 1unit PRBC transfusion at 30. She was
subsequently found to have UTI and presumed urosepsis. Urine Cx
grew proteus, blood cultures show NGTD. She has been on
meropenem (ID following, plan for 7 day total course). She was
also given stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone use.
She also had hypoxia for which pulmonary was consulted. They
thought this was due to pulmonary edema from initial aggressive
IV fluid hydration. She received 40mg iv lasix this morning. Of
note, she was also seen by cardiology on admission for ST
depressions seen on ECG with slightly elevated troponin. They
recommended medical management for likely demand ischemia
She has had atrial fibrillation with difficult to control HRs.
This morning, she had afib with HR 140s with concomitant SBP in
the 80s transiently. Hypotension resolved when HR returned to
90s.
Of note, she also has area of erythema on left elbow concerning
for cellulitis; she has been on vancomycin with improvement.

[**2174-9-20**] 11:50 am BLOOD CULTURE  **FINAL REPORT [**2174-9-26**]**
   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2174-9-26**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2174-9-24**] 4:25 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Line-central.
   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):

CXR [**2174-9-23**]:
1. New right-sided PICC line is in adequate position. There is
no
complication.
2. New pulmonary edema is mild.
3. Left lower lung collapse with moderate pleural effusion is
stable.

CTA abdomen/pelvis [**2174-9-20**]:
1. Left lower abdominal rectus sheath hematoma with a hematocrit
level is grossly similar to this morning's exam at 8:30 a.m.,
and perhaps slightly larger. There is no active arterial
extravasation.
2. Periaortic soft tissue density is attributable to
postoperative fibrosis, as demonstrated by delayed mild
enhancement. No evidence of contrast extravasation.
3. Small left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion.

TTE [**2174-9-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion with no
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Mild to moderate
regional left vetnricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Right
ventricular dilation and mild global hypokinesis. Mild aortic
and mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT Study Date of [**2174-9-25**]
IMPRESSION:  Partially occlusive thrombus in the right axillary
vein.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2174-9-25**]
FINDINGS:  The IJ line has been removed.  The right-sided PICC
line is still in place.  The tip is difficult to visualize on
today's study, but is at least in the superior vena cava.  There
is a moderate left effusion and a tiny right effusion.  There is
volume loss in both lower lobes.  There is pulmonary vascular
redistribution and moderate cardiomegaly
