Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: shortness of breath
REASON FOR CCU ADMISSION: transfer for severe AS, CHF, resp.
failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 85y/o lady with HTN, diastolic HF (EF 70%),
severe AS (valve area 0.8cm2), CVA, and anemia who was admitted
to [**Hospital6 17032**] two days ago for shortness of
breath and is transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU due to CHF with
respiratory failure.

Of note, she was admitted to the OSH twice last month due to CHF
exacerbations.  She had been doing fine at rehab until [**2192-3-28**]
when she went for a doctor's appointment and got acutely short
of breath - by the time she arrived at the OSH ED she had
decreased level of consciousness and was intubated.  She had
pulmonary edema as well as ?RLL infiltrate.  During her OSH
stay, she was ruled out for acute MI, diuresed, and treated for
CAP with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.  Leukocytosis reportedly
decreased from 15 on admission to 5 on the day of transfer.
Left subclavian CVL was subsequently placed and CVP was [**2-23**],
with decrease inurine output.  Given her prior aggressive
diuresis, she was given 500cc IVF followed by maintenance IVF
and 1u pRBC with improvement in her urine output.  Creatinine is
at baseline.

Also, her hospital stay has been notable for anemia.  Her
baseline Hct is 24.  Upon OSH admission her Hct was 28, but
today was 20 in the setting of the fluid boluses and she is
reportedly guaiac negative.  She is a very difficult
cross-match; did receive one unit pRBCs with repeat Hct prior to
transfer of 23.7.

On arrival to the CCU, she is intubated and sedated.  Opens eyes
to command, appears comfortable.  Per discussion with son
[**Name (NI) **], she has never had any interventions for her AS.  Has
not been complaining of chest pain.  She did have syncope in the
past (incl. syncope and a fall 1.5 years ago).  Does get short
of breath with ambulation, which has been her biggest complaint.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Patient is intubated and unable to respond.

Micro:
blood cultures ([**3-30**] and [**4-1**]): no growth
urine cultures ([**3-30**] and [**4-1**] and [**4-9**]): no growth
legionella urinary antigen ([**2192-3-30**]): negative
sputum ([**3-31**]) no growth
catheter tip from central line ([**4-1**]): no growth

STUDIES:
CXR ([**2192-3-31**]):
An ET tube is present.  The tip is partially obscured but
appears to lie
approximately 3.2 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present,
tip extending beneath the diaphragm overlying the gastric
fundus.  A left subclavian line overlies the distal SVC,
unchanged.  No pneumothorax detected.
There is cardiomegaly.  Enlarged tapered pulmonary hilum raises
the question of pulmonary hypertension.  There is upper zone
redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with
CHF.  There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with
left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Probable small
bilateral effusions.   Compared with [**2192-3-30**] at 18:29 p.m.,
there has been slight interval clearing at the right lung base
and in the left mid zone, but, overall, findings are otherwise
similar.

ECHO ([**2192-3-31**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic valve
stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension.

Pathology Crossmatch ([**2192-3-30**]):
Ms [**Known lastname 1968**] has a new diagnosis of anti-E antibody. E antigen is a
member
of the Rh blood group system. Anti-E antibody is clinically
significant
and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the
future,
Ms [**Known lastname 1968**] should receive E antigen negative products for all red
cell
transfusions. Approximately 70% of ABO-compatible blood will be
E
antigen negative.

Limited carotid ultrasound ([**2192-4-2**])
1.  Unable to scan the right carotid artery due to presence of
central venous line.
2.  40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

Cardiac Catheterization ([**2192-4-4**]):
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease of proximal LAD.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Moderately elevated left sided filling pressure.
4. Medical rx for CAD.
5. Return to CCU.
