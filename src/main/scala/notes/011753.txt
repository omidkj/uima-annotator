Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Nsaids

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4028**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Lumbar puncture
-Extubation (was intubated at an outside hospital)


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 year old female with history of CAD, PVD (s/p
left AKA), HTN, CHF, Afib with pacemaker, carotid stenosis, and
hypothyroidism who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **]
with right inguinal pain and right foot pain. In the ED, right
foot was initially cold and pale but warmed up by itself. She
received dilaudid for pain.
.
Per discharge summary from [**Hospital3 **], patient was
doing well until her second day when she had 2 witnessed
seizures (tonic clonic on right side of body) lasting about 10
minutes each. HR 160s, BP 150s at the time. Patient was
intubated for airway protection. She was given 2 mg Ativan.
Patient had stat head CT which showed old lacunar infarcts. Her
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 81048**] depressions
diffusely different from her old EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
were elevated with troponin of 0.33. Troponin peaked here at
0.55 but trending down to 0.37. Cardiac index normal.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of seizures.
.
Patient could not have MRI because of pacemaker. She had LP
which was negative for meningitis. Per neurology, they think
cause of seizures is toxic-metabolic vs. PRES as she was noted
to have pressures 190-200 systolic when the propofol was weaned.
No history of seizures in her or her family. Patient was
extubated at 11 am on [**4-5**] successfully.
.
Patient denies any headache, dizziness, chest pain, sob, cough,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leg pain or any other
symptoms. She asked multiple times when she would be able to
leave the hospital. She does not remember the events of her
hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **]. Per family, she
complains of chest pain at rest intermittently at home.
.
Cardiology was consulted while she was in the TSICU and felt her
troponin rise was due to demand ischemia in setting of seizure
and tachycardia. Given her multiple medical problems and since
her enzymes were trending down and she was not having any
current symptoms, cardiology recommended ongoing medical
management of CAD and no interventions. They recommended
stopping heparin gtt and holding amiodarone (started in TSICU)
and sotalol (takes at home) because of long QT. Also recommended
starting her home lopressor dose which was being held.
.
Given her multiple medical issues and seizure thought to be
related to HTN, neurology requested medical transfer. Neurology
recommended EEG, carotid ultrasound, and echocardiogram/TTE. She
was on Dilantin 100 mg TID at time of transfer. Neurology to
follow her on the consult service.
