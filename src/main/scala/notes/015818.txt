Allergies:
Levaquin / Bactrim / Flexeril / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BIPAP

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year old female with a history of
CREST/scleroderma, COPD (known to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4648**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], FEV1% 62%),
mild PAH (echo [**5-29**] PAH 27 mm Hg), no known CAD, bilateral
diffuse peripheral vascular disease who presented to the ED from
her PCP's office on [**2118-7-7**] the chief complaint of worsening
shortness of breath.
.
The patient has a long history of exertional dyspnea with mild
PAH and says she is short of breath with exertion at baseline
but is able to walk 2 blocks without difficulty at baseline.
However, over the past 1-2 weeks, the patient notes that she has
had progressive increasing shortness of breath that manifested
on the Sunday prior to admission when she was walking to her car
(approximately 600 feet) and felt increased shortness of breath,
diaphoresis, no chest pain or radiating pain to her
jaw/back/arms. She experiences bilateral calf pain with a
history of bilateral PVD with exertion and thought she was
anxious because of the pain.
.
Of note, she recently returned from [**Country 4754**] [**6-14**] to [**2118-6-21**]. Her
symptoms began shortly thereafter.
.
The patient has noticed increasing orthopnea requiring 2 pillows
over the past week (she sleeps without a pillow at baseline).
Her weight she thinks has been stable. She admits to paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea which she says is new after prolonged coughing
spells (sparse white sputum) with lying flat. She denies any
chest pain or radiating symptoms. She admits to a salty diet and
drinks at least 60 oz. of fluid a day. She states her baseline
weight is 153 pounds.
.
She saw her NP at [**Hospital3 4262**] Group on Monday. She was given 2
nebulizer treatments and sent home with albuterol and atrovent
for presumed COPD exacerbation. She has never been intubated
before and does not have a peak flow meter at home. Her symptoms
did improve with nebulizers.
.
She was re-evaluated on Wednesday by her NP who then treated her
again with 2 albuterol/atrovent nebulizer treatments and gave
her azithromycin 500 mg for which she took 2 doses.
.
She was to follow up on [**2118-7-7**] in clinic but called early given
increasing shortness of breath. She was evaluated in the clinic
and referred to the ED for further management. Labs from her
PCP's office on [**7-6**] revealed a sodium of 127, HCO3 22. Hct 35.
.
In the ED, she was given 125 mg IV solumedrol for ? COPD
exacerbation. Her CXR was negative for acute disease/CHF. Her
EKG had no ischemic changes. However, her CK was 296, MB 27, MBI
9.1, trop 0.1 (new). BNP 3698 ( up from 98 in [**May 2117**]). Her Na
was 119 (she has reported history of hyponatremia). She was
given ASA 325 mg and albuterol nebulizer. Initially, she was
breathing on  2 liters O2 sat'ing in the mid 90s and was 92% on
RA. She underwent a a CT-A to rule out PE and upon her return,
she became acutely diaphoretic, tachypneic to the 40s and her
SBP peaked to the 220s -> she was placed on CPAP+ PS TV FiO2
100%, TV 911, rate 27, PEEP 5, PSV 5, sat'ing 96% and a nitro
gtt.
.
Her EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 bpm, NL axis, intervals.
Delayed R wave progression. Flattened T waves I, AVL, V1-V2. No
STE/depression. Compared to baseline [**5-29**], no change.
.
A gas during this time showed on BIPAP:
.
7.17/54/369/21
.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED given her elevated cardiac
enzymes but felt her presentation was noncardiac and not
ischemic in origin. She was started on a heparin gtt in the ED.
.
In the ED, the patient had a CT-A on [**2118-7-7**] which showed no PE.
A CXR showed no CHF.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was 93% on RA and 97% on 4
liters O2, breathing comfortably off of CPAP which she stated
she had been on for 45 minutes.
.
ECHO [**2117-6-7**]:
.
Conclusions:
EF >55%, diastolic dysfunction. Mild PAH, 27 mm Hg.
.
The patient had a similar presentation in [**5-29**] at which time she
ruled out for an MI, found to not have a PE, and her symptoms
were felt to be secondary to a URI.
.
ROS:
.
Positive for claudication. No fevers/chills. Positive for cough
worse with lying flat. Recent constipation relieved with
laxatives.
.

EKG [**2118-7-7**]: sinus rhythm at 98 bpm, NL axis, intervals. Delayed
R wave progression. Flattened T waves I, AVL, V1-V2. No
STE/depression. Compared to baseline [**5-29**], no change.

CXR [**2118-7-7**]: no CHF.

CT-A [**2118-7-7**]: No PE.
FINDINGS: No filling defect is identified within the pulmonary
arteries. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is
identified. The heart is normal in size. The proximal coronary
arteries are patent. The pericardium is unremarkable. Again
noted are bullous changes, more prominent at the apices,
consistent with emphysema, unchanged. Previously described small
non- calcified nodules in the right middle lobe (series 2, image
36), right upper lobe (series 2, image 19) and left upper lobe
(series 2, image 10) are unchanged. Pleural plaques are present
which
