Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82F h/o prior CVA with residual R-sided weakness, AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2
cm2), cecal and splenic flexure masses admitted with chest pain.
Describes 3 days of chest pain that radiates across the chest,
occuring only while supine at night, describes as a constant
"punching" sensation, lasting multiple hours, and resolving
either spontaneously or with tylenol. Pain is similar in
character, but more severe, compared to prior episodes (most
recently many months ago). Had one episode of nonbloody emesis.
No associated dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations,
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, dyspepsia, edema, or
positional/exertional component. Son also reports seeing bright
red blood on the bed sheets two days ago (not since). When pain
recurred for the 3rd straight night, she presented to the ED.

Had CP in the ED, at which time EKG showed ~1mm ST elev in aVR
with new ST dep in I,II,L,V2-V6. Given ASA 325, morphine 2 mg
(with resolution of pain), protonix 40 mg IV. EKG changes
improved with resolution of pain. Given [**1-24**] unit pRBC then

Imaging:
[**2199-7-13**] PA/LAT Evaluation is suboptimal, due to patient rotation
and
underpenetration. Mild vascular congestion has resolved. The
lungs are clear without focal consolidation. Moderate
cardiomegaly persists, with a slightly tortuous aorta. Dense
calcifications are present in the mitral annulus. Mild
degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
82F h/o CVA, AS, known colonic masses admitted with chest pain
at rest and global ischemic EKG changes in the setting of acute
on chronic blood loss anemia.  Admitted to the MICU on [**7-13**],
transferred to the floor on [**7-14**], discharged on [**7-16**].
.
#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia - Patient was admitted to
the MICU with chest pain x 3 days after son had noticed a
significant amount of blood in her bed.  On admission, Hct was
found to be 20.  She was transfused 4U and hct stabilized in the
low 30s where it remained for admission.  She spent one night in
the MICU and was transferred to the floor on HOD #2.  The source
of her bleeding has not been confirmed, but differential
includes hemmhoroidal, diverticular, or from masses in her cecum
an splenic flexure which were found on colonoscopy in [**3-/2199**]
(likely malignant).  She was followed by both surgery and GI
in-house and both agreed that she would likely need surgical
intervention for the masses but acknowledged that she had a high
surgical risk (aortic stenosis, history of CVA).  She remained
hemodynamically stable on the floor, but did have an episode of
BRBPR on HOD#3 with a hct drop from 31.6-->29.9.  She remained
asymptomatic with this episode and did not require PRBC. A
tagged red blood cell scan was deferred given that she was
asymptomatic.  She was discharged on HOD#4 with follow-up in the
geriatrics clinic for further discussion of options for her
colonic masses.  She was informed to return to the ED if her
symptoms of chest pain return, or if she has significant
bleeding.
.
#Chest pain/EKG changes - Along with BRBPR, patient presented
with chest pain , and an EKG with diffuse ST depressions,
suggestive of global ischemia in the setting of profound anemia,
likely a demand ischemia. Her pain resolved with blood
transfusions.  Aspirin 81 mg was restarted, and beta blockade
was also started, and she continued to receive her statin.  She
continued to remain asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint
throughout transfer to floor and remainder of admission.
.
#Colonic masses-  Seen by both surgery and GI in-house.  Both
agreed that surgical intervention was likely warranted given
high likelyhood of malignancy from her cecal/splenic flexure
masses.  However her comorbidities make her an increased
surgical risk, especially in the setting of her recent acute
bleed.  Decision was made by the primary team to have her follow
up with geriatrics the following week to discuss options.
.
#HTN - On admission to the MICU, she was started beta blockade
and her lisinopril/dilt were held in the setting of the bleed.
Lisinopril was restarted upon transfer to the floor on [**7-14**].
Metoprolol was continued through her discharge day, and she was
discharged on her diltiazem at home dose with instructions to
have her home health aid to check her blood pressure as an
outpatient.
