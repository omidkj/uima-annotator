Admission Date:  [**2110-3-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2110-3-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2046-12-20**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old man
with a [**5-17**] month period of episodic chest pain which has been
progressively becoming worse.  These episodes occur up to
three times per week, developed at rest or with exertion.
They are associated with dizziness and left arm numbness
which radiates down to his fingers.  He had noted using
Nitroglycerin in the past with some relief but he has not
used any recently.  When these occur, he performs some
relaxation techniques which help in shortening the length of
the episode.  Sometimes they persist up to three hours.  He
notes that he has had similar symptoms in the past and has
had a cardiac catheterization twice in the early [**2097**]'s, all
of which have been reported as negative, though they reported
valvular abnormalities.  A work-up in the past has also
included an echocardiogram which showed a dilated left atrium
with normal left ventricular function, positive mitral
stenosis with a mean gradient of 5 mmHg with a valvular area
of 1.6 cm sq., mean aortic gradient of 45 mmHg with a
valvular area of 1.1 cm sq.  Due to the fact that his
symptoms have progressively become worse over the last year,
the patient presents to [**Hospital1 69**]
for cardiac catheterization and then question AVR, MVR
performed by the cardiothoracic team led by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypercholesterolemia,
status post TIA.  TIA reports about 1-2 times per week, they
present as loss of vision, passing out, dizziness or migraine
symptoms and now patient was placed on Coumadin.  Also
history of anxiety, congestive heart failure, decreased PFTs
and diabetes mellitus.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for status post
cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission include Coumadin 2.5 mg on Tuesday
and Thursday and 5 mg on all other days (Coumadin was held on
[**2-27**]).  Also Glucophage 500 mg po q 12 hours p.m., Lasix 20
mg po q d, Lipitor 10 mg po q d, Folate 0.4 mg q h.s., Toprol
25 mg po q d, Serzone 100 mg po bid, Buspar 5 mg po tid,
Ambien 5 mg q h.s. prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, retired manager for
a local company.  Occasional etoh use.  Occasional pipe use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is a white male in no acute
distress, temperature 97.8, heart rate 56, blood pressure
107/46, breathing at 18, 90% on room air.  His neck is supple
with no lymphadenopathy.  His lungs are clear.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm with systolic and diastolic murmurs.
Abdomen is soft and nontender.  No peripheral edema.  Distal
pulses intact.  He is alert and oriented times three,
neurologically intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission include white count of 8.9,
hematocrit 43.9, platelet count 280,000, sodium 135,
potassium 4.2, chloride 98, CO2 31, BUN 18, creatinine 1.2.

Chest x-ray shows within normal limits, no evidence of
pneumothorax or infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 346**] where he underwent cardiac
catheterization.  We felt this was significant for right
dominant circulation with no flow limiting coronary artery
disease.  Also there was a significant aortic stenosis with
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 cm sq and a mean gradient of [**3-15**] mmHg.  There
is mitral stenosis with mean gradient of 5 mmHg and MVA of
1.8 cm sq.  There was an EF of 60%.  Also significant for 2+
aortic regurgitation.  The patient procedure well and then on
[**2110-3-10**] the patient went to the operating room where he
underwent AVR with a Carbomedics #21 and MVR with Carbomedics
#27.  The patient tolerated this procedure well, was
transferred to the SICU, AV paced on Propofol drip.
Postoperatively the patient's systolic blood pressure was
labile initially.  He was placed on IV Nitroglycerin.  On
arriving to the unit he proceeded to have a high chest tube
output of 450 ml in 90 minutes.  He received 50 mg of
Protamine times two, two units of FP and two units of packed
red blood cells.  Hematocrit then went from 23 to 29.  The
patient was weaned to extubate on postoperative day #1.  The
patient was weaned off of drips, was awake, alert and
oriented times three.  He continued to be paced with
underlying nodal rhythm in the 50's.  Postoperative day #2
the patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood
cells for hematocrit of 22.7.  He was continued to be on VVI
at a rate of 58.  He was otherwise stable when transferred to
the floor.  On the floor the patient was reporting feeling
jolts with the pacer.  In place, the pacer was turned off and
the underlying rhythm was junctional with a rate in the 60's.
His blood pressure was stable at 115-120/60-70.  He was left
in this rhythm.  He was evaluated by the EP service who
determined he would benefit from the placement of a pacemaker
secondary to arrest of sinus node.  Postoperative day #3 the
patient went into atrial fibrillation.  With the rate up to
100's, blood pressure remained stable.  Then on the morning
of postoperative day #4 the patient continued in an irregular
rhythm with rates up into the 100's, had an 8 second pause on
the monitor.  The patient stated he felt a hot burst through
his body and a dull feeling in his heart.  The staff ran into
the room and upon entering, the monitor spontaneously showed
the start of a junctional rhythm.  That day patient went to
the EP lab where he underwent placement of a DDD pacer.
Since that time, patient has remained AV paced.  Blood
pressures remained stable.  The patient has been Coumadinized
to the appropriate INR of greater than 2 and for his valve
and atrial fibrillation.  The patient has been ambulating,
tolerating a regular diet and is now ready for discharge to
home.
