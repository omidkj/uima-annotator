Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old Cantonese speaking male with metastatic
NSCLC proven by biopsy on [**2175-9-5**] admitted from clinic p/w
severe [**8-27**] neck and intermittent R chest wall pain. Per the

STUDIES
.
CT SPINE [**2175-9-19**]:
1. Pathologic fracture of C5 vertebral body. Posterior aspect of
C5 likely
contacts the spinal cord. If patient can tolerate, MRI of the
cervical spineis recommended. Additionally, erosion of the
transverse process at this level is present. If indicated,
evaluation of the vertebral arteries may be performed with MRA
neck or CTA of the neck.

2. Multiple pulmonary nodules, better evaluated on CT
examination dated
[**2175-9-13**].

3. Asymmetry of the paraspinal muscles on the right could
indicate additional metastatic disease and/or intramuscular
hematoma.

4. Multiple additional lucencies in the cervical spine
concerning for
metastatic disease, most notable in the C7 vertebral body.
.
MRI SPINE [**2175-9-20**]
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Metastatic involvement at multiple cervical levels, centered
around a C5
vertebral body which demonstrates compression deformity, and
retropulsion due to complete invasion by metastatic tumor. There
is associated central canal stenosis, with spinal cord
compression, though there is no intrinsic cord abnormality at
present.

2. Metastatic involvement of T3, L1, and the left iliac bone,
with no
expansion outside of the bony confines.

3. Mass in the soft tissues of the posterior neck most
consistent with
hematoma, which should be correlated linically
.
LENIs [**2175-10-1**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity
DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 M w/recently diagnosed NSCLC p/w severe neck pain [**9-19**] s/p
anterior C4-6 diskectomy with anterior fusion on [**9-20**] and
posterior fusion [**9-21**], admitted to SICU for difficult airway s/p
extubation [**9-25**] transferred back to oncology floor [**9-30**] for
pain control.
.
#Agitation: Delirium was initially thought to be due to large
amount of narcotics that patient was recieving in ICU and
patient was started on haldol.  On the oncology floor, the
haldol was initially stopped and the pain regimen was modified
but the patient continued to have agitation and restlessness.
It was felt that the agitation was most likely secondary to
either pain or dyspnea associated with mucus/secretion
accumulation.  Mental status changes may also be related to
prolonged hospitalization/sundowning. The patient's
agitation/restlessness tended to improve greatly with prn pain
medications and/or suctioning.  He was started on prn olanzapine
for agitation as well.  Vitals overnight were held.  Our
recommendation is to avoid restraints, hold vitals overnight,
provide a bed next to a window if at all possible, use pain
medications and suctioning as first line treatment for agitation
and to use olanzapine as back-up.
.
#Neck Pain: Secondary to cancer mets as well as post-op pain.
Neck pain difficult to assess give patient's mental status and
language barriers.  Palliative care was consulted to determine
an appropriate pain regimen.  Patient was NPO after failing
speech and swallow several times including video swallow
evaluation.  His pain was managed with a fentanyl patch and SL
morphine.  Radiation-oncology was consulted for palliative
radiation options and the decision was made with the family not
to pursue any radiation at this time.
.
#Nutrition: The patient failed speech and swallow in the ICU and
was made NPO.  A doboff was placed but he pulled it out and the
decision was made in conjuction with the family not to pursue
another doboff.  He failed repeat speech and swallow including
video swallow study, which was attributed more to post-op
changes/neck swelling rather than mental status.  Per speech and
swallow, the patient will aspirate if he takes POs but we can
make pt comfortable and minimize cough by feeding him thin
liquids and pureed solids by spoon.  Family meeting was held
with medical-oncology team, palliative care, and primary
oncologist.  Decision was made not to pursue feeding tube at
this time.
.
#NSCLC: Biopsy proven on [**2175-7-6**], initially presenting with neck
pain and ?pathologic C5 fracture evaluated by orthopedic
surgery. CT chest reveals multiple mets. s/p anterior C4-6
diskectomy with anterior fusion on [**9-20**] and posterior fusion
[**9-21**].  Patient had previously communicated wishes to family that
he would not want chem
