Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
82yoM with complicated medical history including CHF (EF 25%),
moderate aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin,
s/p CABG [**2130**], AV block s/p dual chamber [**Year (4 digits) 4448**], COPD,
presenting with hypotension and lethargy.
.
The patient was previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-21**] - [**12-28**] for
community acquired pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and heart
failure exacerbation.  He was noted to have bilateral
infiltrates and has a history of MRSA, and was treated with
Vancomycin IV, Ceftriaxone po, Prednisone taper x12 days.  His
Lasix was decreased from 40 mg daily prior to admission to 20 mg
daily on discharge for acute renal failure, and Losartan was
held at time of discharge due to the elevated creatinine.  His
prior hospital course was complicated by dysphagia and concerns
for aspiration.  He was discharged to [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**] on
Vancomycin IV through a right double lumen PICC, Ceftriaxone po,
and a 12 day Prednisone taper.  Around [**1-11**], he was started on a
7 day course of Flagyl.  Per ED documentation, the patient then
developed symptoms consistent with a CHF exacerbation on [**1-15**]
and was diuresed with Torsemide [**Hospital1 **].  However, he continued to
be short of breath and wheezing, and was started on Prednisone
again on [**1-17**].  The day prior to transfer at his rehabilitation
facility, the patient was noted to be lethargic and fatigued.
He was found to be hypotensive in the 80's/60's with question of
hypoxia and was sent to the ED by EMS.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.2 80 99/50 18 91% 2L n/c (noted
to have PO2 in the 80's on RA, later 94% on 2L NC)
Labs were significant for an elevated creatinine of 2.1 from a
baseline of 1.5 within the last year, elevated lactate of 2.4,
and stable BNP in the 4000's consistent with prior values.  A
CXR was obtained and he was given a dose of Vancomycin IV and
Zosyn IV empirically.  He received 250cc and 500cc boluses of NS
for a total of [**12-18**].5L with appropriate increases in blood
pressure and urine output, but blood pressures subsequently
decreased back to the 80's systolic.  He was started on Levophed
0.3 through his right PICC, as he declined a central line
placement in the ED, and SBP were 110's.  Hydrocortisone 100 mg
IV was given for hypotension without significant improvement in
blood pressure.    Although the patient denies history of
shortness of breath currently, he was reported to endorse
dyspnea on intial presentation to the ED and was placed on
oxygen 2L NC.  He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and
hypoxia in the low to mid 90's on 2L NC.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was breathing comfortably
and denied any complaints including pain, shortness of breath,
cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache,
lightheadedness, chest pain, or other symptoms.  He did report
feeling very tired and fatigued.

CXR [**1-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited, negative. PICC in appropriate position.
Limited
evaluation due to motion artifact, repeat CXR might be
considered.

CXR [**1-19**]:
FINDINGS: Patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary
artery bypass surgery. ICD remains in place as well as a right
PICC. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and accompanied by
mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Persistent patchy right
basilar opacity and new patchy left lower lobe opcity as well as
a persistent linear area of atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
The etiology of the basilar opacities is uncertain, but could
represent aspiration, infectious pneumonia, or a dependent
distribution of edema in the setting of known upper lobe
predominant emphysema.

EKG [**1-19**]:
Ventricular paced rhythm with a ventricular premature beat and a
fusion beat. Compared to previous tracing of [**2136-1-18**] the fusion
beat is new. The ventricular rate is faster.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension:  The patient's clinical presentation is
consistent with hypotension secondary to hypovolemia, likely
from overdiuresis.  His Lasix dose was increased as an
outpatient and he subsequently was diuresed with Torsemide just
prior to admission for dyspnea that was attributed to a CHF
exacerbation.  The patient's mildly elevated lactate on initial
presentation which down-trended with IVF, as well as hypo
