Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Failure to wean off ventilator, question of
tracheobronchomalacia

Arterial line

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 80 y o Creole-speaking male with
PMHx significant for COPD, asthma, HTN, hyperlipidemia, sick
sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker placement who presented from
[**Hospital 107**] Hospital in [**State 792**]for evaluation by
interventional pulmonology of tracheobroncheomalacia for
possible stenting. Patient admitted to [**Hospital 796**] Hospital in RI
on [**2101-9-9**] for SOB (and has been in hospital since admission
date), treated for COPD exacerbation and URI, required
intubation for respiratory failure.  Complications during the
hospitalization at the OSH included VAP (serratia, pseudomonas)
treated with cefepime. Had a CT on [**10-4**] with BL pleural
effusion, with compressive atelectasis. Also had ? sick sinus
syndrome s/p pacemaker placement on [**10-27**], shock liver and DIC
secondary to sepsis, severe C.diff colitis now resolved, and
anasarca. Underwent tracheostomy on [**2101-9-29**] and despite this has
failed weaning attempts. Per outside hospital notes, he was seen
by cardiology consultant on [**10-11**], because there were several
episodes fo bradycardia/PEA during repositioning thought [**2-14**]
mucous plugging.  He also had an episode of narrow complex
tachycardia that may have been A fib.
Patient was transfered from OSH on [**11-11**] for evaluation by IP
for possible stent placement for TBM. Upon transfer from OSH,
routine EKG was performed and found to be abnormal. EKG showed
0.5-1mm STD in II/III/AVF, trops 0.4 with normal renal function.
 Repeat troponins stable (0.41) this AM.  Echo this AM, with EF
>55%, no focal WMA.  Cardiology was consulted on patient, would
like to cycle troponins, and if these increase will plan to do
cardiac catheterization, otherwise would like to medically
manage. Since arrival patient has had antibiotics stopped, and
pan-culted; has been afebrile here, MAP 60. Patient is making
appropriate urine, 1.4L urine since midnight. Patient was also
started on Diamox for alkalosis. For rate control patient was
changed from diltiazem to beta blocker, with good rate control.
Nutrition was also consulted on the patient, and per their recs
tube feeds were started.
.
Review of systems positive for right eye pain, increased right
eye pain with right eye movement, and decreased vision in right
eye. 14 point review of systems reviewed and otherwise negative.

IMAGING, siginificant. For full list of images see OMR
[**2101-11-11**] EKG

Atrial paced rhythm. Slight inferior ST segment elevation.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

[**2101-11-11**] Echo
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
[**11-11**] CXR

FINDINGS: No previous images. There is hyperexpansion of the
lungs with
flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic
pulmonary disease.
Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with pleural
effusions.
Tracheostomy tube is in place, as is a dual-channel pacemaker
device.

No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.

[**11-13**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling and other recordings showed a mildly slow background in

wakefulness suggestive of an encephalopathy. Nevertheless, there
were
no areas of prominent focal slowing. There were no epileptiform
features in the recording, whether by routine sampling or by
automated
detection programs. There were no electrographic seizures.

[**11-13**] CT head without contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Severely limited study secondary to streak artifact from
metallic EEG
leads rendering the study nearly nondiagnostic. No definite
acute
intracranial process identified. Repeat exam is highly
recommended following
removal of metallic leads.
2. Diffuse opacification of the sinuses, which may be related to
intubation.
Infection cannot be excluded.

[**2101-11-14**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling showed a mild to moderately diffusely encephalopathic
background consisting of mostly theta activity with oc
