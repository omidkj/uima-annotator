Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Codeine / Vicodin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
patient expired [**5-21**].

History of Present Illness:
87 year old male with h/o CAD s/p CABG, Afib, SSS s/p PPM, CHF
with EF 35%, moderate-severe AS, HTN, HL, and prostate cancer
who presented on [**5-3**] to [**Hospital3 **] with worsening SOB
found to have an [**Hospital 39700**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath,
and now transferred to CCU in setting of worsening respiratory
distress and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.

.

He reports over a month of shortness of breath which worsened in
the few days prior to admission and was associated with
worsening peripheral edema.  He had previously increased his
home lasix dose but this did not improve his breathing.  His
weight increased 10 pounds over one week prior to admission with
substantial peripheral edema.  He then developed nausea and
vomiting and presented to the ED at [**Location (un) **].  At the time of
admission to OSH he denied any chest pain.  He did endorse
recent diarrhea.  He also endorsed 3 pillow orthopnea and severe
PND.

.

On admission to [**Location (un) **], Troponin I was 0.19 with CPK of 65.
Creatinine was elevated to 1.6.  Cardiology was consulted and he
was treated with IV lasix with improvement in his SOB and lower
extremity edema.  Creatinine improved to 1.2 throughout his
stay.  His troponin I initially downtrended to 0.13.  Yesterday
he had an episode of recurrent chest pain with transfer from
chair to bed that lasted 15 minutes and resolved without
intervention.  Troponin I then trended up to 0.42 with unchanged
CK.  He was loaded with 300mg Plavix this morning.  He was not
given lovenox or a heparin gtt given anemia Hct to 28-30.  He
was chest pain free on transfer.  He was also started on digoxin
at the OSH for his CHF and was also started on amiodarone.
Vitals on transfer: 96.4, 108/68, 60 paced, 99% 2LNC.  He was
transferred for cardiac catheterization Tuesday.

.

While at [**Hospital1 18**] today, he went to cardiac catheterization; prior
to procedure he became very nauseous and endorsed difficulty
breathing.  His breathing difficulty was noted to consist of
periods of apnea associated with rapid, short breaths, thought
to be consistent with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.  Troponins were
stable and EKG did not reveal any new changes.  Given
respiratory distress, he was transferred to the CCU for further
management.

.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.  Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
syncope or presyncope.
