History of Present Illness:
76 year-old woman with type 2 DM complicated by ESRD on HD,
hypertension/hyperlipidemia CHF (EF 30-40% in [**3-/2162**]),
sarcoidosis who presents with bright red blood per rectum. The
patient was in her usual state of health this morning when she
had two bowel movements ~9:30 am which were soft, slightly loose
and the toilet bowl was filled with blood. The patient denies
chest pain, shortness of breath, lethargy with these two
episodes although she did endorse some mild abdominal crampiness
and lightheadedness. Of note, the patient had a normal
colonoscopy in [**2160-5-13**] when she was also evaluated for BRBPR.
She had been guaiac negative X3 last week, per report.

She was brought from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to the ED where her initial
Hct 31.3 (baseline low 30s) and her creatinine slightly elevated
from priors but no significant electrolyte abnormalities. She
reports her last HD session was last Tuesday. Her initial vitals
were T98.2, BP185/72, HR80, RR20 and 99% on RA. The patient had
two more bowel movements in the ED which were maroon colored,
with streaks of blood also on soft stools so she was admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She denied any symptoms, including crampy abdominal
pain, with these two bowel movements. She received 2L IVF.

ROS (+) Per HPI

.
EKG ([**1-11**]): Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2162-8-11**] no diagnostic interim change.
.
CXR ([**1-11**]): Left PICC ends at level of mid to low SVC. No
pneumothorax.
.
Sigmoidoscopy ([**1-14**]):
Findings: Contents: Old blood was seen in the rectum, sigmoid
and descending colon, and splenic flexure. Blood was washed off
at multiple sites and normal appearing mucosa was noted beneath.
Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the rectum, sigmoid colon,
descending colon and splenic flexure. Protruding Lesions Two
non-bleeding polyps of benign appearance and ranging in size
from 2 mm to 3 mm were found in the rectum. Excavated Lesions
Multiple non-bleeding diverticula were seen in the sigmoid colon
and descending colon.
Impression: Blood in the rectum, sigmoid colon and descending
colon. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Polyps in the rectum. Normal mucosa in the rectum, sigmoid
colon, descending colon and splenic flexure. Otherwise normal
sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure.
Recommendations: Return to hospital floor.
Follow Hcts and transfuse PRN.
Will need full colonoscopy at some point.
If brisk bleeding would proceed to tagged-RBC scan.
.
Colonoscopy ([**1-17**]) Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 682**] or by email [**University/College **]. Likely
resolved diverticuli bleeding.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 year-old woman with ESRD, CHF (EF 30-40%), was initially
admitted with LGIB to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  In the ICU she received 3 units of
PRBCs over the course of 3 days.  She was transferred to the
floor where she received a 4th unit of PRBC ([**1-14**]). 1st attempt
at bowel prep resulted in pulmonary edema after 1L golytely.
Tried tap water enema instead for flex sig.  Flex sig [**1-14**]
showed old blood.  Pt still with intermittent blood per rectum,
so a reattempt at bowel prep was made. Slow prep with GoLytely
over 36 hours was successful.  She underwent colonoscopy which
showed diverticulosis, but no blood.  It was suspected that her
episode of bleeding was likely due to a diverticular bleed.  Due
to this episode, it is recommended that patient remain off of
bisacodyl, as it may predispose her to future episodes of
bleeding.

# Anemia [**3-16**] acute blood loss from LGIB: patient recieved 4
units of PRBC transfusion.

# ESRD: patient continued HD, and required dialysis for
management of acute CHF.

# HTN, benign: On Losartan, helding Coreg during GI bleed, but
this was resumed prior to discharge.

# Systolic CHF, EF 30-40%
Pt developed pulmonary edema from Golytely prep during the
admission, for which she received dialysis.  On [**1-18**], she felt
somewhat short of breath and had pulmonary rales on exam. She
underwent HD with 1 liter fluid removal, and she now appears
euvolemic.  Her Avapro (non-formulary) was replaced with
Losartan during the admission, which she tolerated well. Coreg
was resumed prior to discharge.

# CAD, native vessel:
Her Aspirin and plavix were initially held due to her GI
bleeding.  Her HCT appeared stable, without any evidence of
ongoing bleed, so she was resumed on her aspirin 81 mg po q day
on [**1-18**].  Her Plavix remains held for now, and recommend
resuming on [**1-21**].

# Diabetes type II, controlled: continued insulin sliding scale

# Gout, chronic: continued allopurinol

# Sarcoidosis: No
