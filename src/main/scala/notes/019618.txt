Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Motrin / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
Watery diarrhea for two weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 69yo AAF with a PMHx significant for ESRD, COPD,
HIV+, CAD, CHF, PEA arrest, MR, PE, GI bleeds, Anemia, and
Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma that was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia and treated with a complete dose of
antibiotics, that began to have watery diarrhea for five days,
developed fevers, chills, and abdominal pain. Pain is diffuse,
nonfocal, [**7-28**], and not associated with nausea or vomiting.
.
CC: Transfer from surgery service with diarrhea
.
HPI: 69 female with MMP including ESRD on HD, HIV (cd4 940
[**7-23**], on HAART), CAD s/p MI, CHF, COPD presents to our service
for continued treatment of medical conditions and diarrhea.
Briefly, she was admitted on [**12-12**] with fever chills and
abdominal pain one week after being discharged on
vanco/levo/flagyl for pneumonia.  She reports increasing
frequency of BM and worsening abdominal pain.  She had F/C at
home, but was free of them since being in hospital.  She also
had episodes of chest pain while at rest at hemodialysis.
Cardiology was consulted twice. THe first episode was associated
with a troponin elevation, thought to be due to demand ischemia
in the setting of going into AF.  The second episode of
substernal burning was releived with maalox, and felt to be very
atypical for ischemic chest pain.  She has also been followed by
infectious disesase for a fairly resistant diarrhea, with the
only positive micro data being positive c.dif.  The diarrhea was
watery, and is slowly improving.
.
She currently is feeling well, with much less abdominal pain and
slowing frequency of bowel movements.  She had 3 BM two days
ago, 2 BM yesterday, and 1 BM thus far today (more formed).  She
has been treated with flagyl, PO vanco, and cholestyramine.  She
was admitted with a WBC of 23K, and now is 11K.  Her hematocrit
has remained stable in mid 30s.  She has been persistently
elevated.  Her INR was supratherapeutic on admission (on
warfarin for h/o DVT with PE) at 10.  Her warfarin was restarted
now.  She currently denies F/C/NS, occasional cough, no
abdominal pain. SHe has occasional nausea that responds to
anzemet.

CT C/A/P [**12-13**] - 1. Interval development of bowel wall edema
affecting the entire length of the colon with peri-colic
stranding consistent with pan-colitis. In the setting of
prolonged antibiotic use, this is suspicious for Clostridium
difficile / pseudomembranous colitis. No pneumatosis or portal
venous gas is seen. No extraluminal air or free air is seen.
2. Interval improvement with residual opacity in previously
demonstrated multilobar patchy opacities.3. Persistent
spiculated right upper lobe focus that measures smaller in size
compared to the previous exam.
4. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 5. Bilateral
low-attenuation renal lesions that are too small to
characterize.6. Possible tiny low-attenuation lesion in the
uncinate process of the pancreas that is probably unchanged
compared to the previous exam

CXR [**12-12**] - Right perihilar ill defined paranchymal opacity; ?

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to hospital electively on [**12-12**] for watery
diarrhea and possible operative intervention based on patient's
prednisone usage. Patient was started on empiric flagyl and
serial abdominal exams, while obtaining a CT scan whose results
are mentioned above. Patient was admitted to the ICU for her h/o
PEA, and WBC of 24.9 concerning for possible bowel/colitis
rupture. Renal was consulted to manage the patients dialysis
needs, ID was consulted to manage her colitis, and cardiology to
r/o possible MI.  Patient felt much improved by HD2, cardiology
supported her beta blockade administration and felt no
antiarrhythmic was warranted. ID recommended vancomycin
empirically while sending three stool studies for c.diff toxin
and stool cultures.  By HD4, patient's abdomen was soft and
nontender, but etiology not yet determined, and diarrhea
episodes continued.  ID recommended oral vancomycin
administration and no flagyl.  Cardiology felt patient's
elevated Troponins were the result of demand ischemia and not an
acute coronary event.  Patient was allowed to advance diet as
tolerated but maintained on PO vanco for 14 day total course.
Patient continued to have numerous, nonbloody bowel movements.
On HD 7 while obtaining HD, the patient had episode of CP for
which and EKG was obtained and reviewed by
