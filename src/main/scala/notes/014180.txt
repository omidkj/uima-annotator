Brief Hospital Course:
83 year-old woman with CRI, dementia presents with multi-lobar
pneumonia.
.
# Pneumonia: Patient presented to ED with confusion, shortness
of breath, cough and chest pressure. Bilateral infiltrates on
chest x-ray on admission. No significant hospital exposures,
lives at home. Reason for admission to MICU was Confusion,
uremia, and age: CURB-65 score of 3 and 3 minor criteria for ICU
admission. Patient started on Vancomycin/Levofloxacin in the
ICU. On transfer to the floor patient was narrowed to only
levofloxacin. Given her renal dysfunction, the patient's
levofloxacin was dosed every 48 hours. She received her final
dose to complete a seven day course on the afternoon of
discharge. Patient continued to improve clinically on only
levofloxacin and was sating 97% on room air at discharge. With
ambulation patient maintained sats. She will follow up with
PCP/Nephrology on discharge.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline 2.4 prior to
admission. On admission creatinine 3.9. Likely pre renal.
Improved to 3.0 at discharge with IVF. FeNa of 1.2 suggests some
intrinsic renal component as well. Patient scheduled for follow
up with Nephrology as an outpatient. Patient given instruction
to maintain a low potassium diet as an outpatient.
.
# Anemia: Low Reticulocyte index. Elevated ferritin. Most likely
secondary to renal disease and may benefit from EPO. Patient
scheduled for follow up with Nephrology.
.
# Dementia and psychosis: Continued on Zyprexa. Patient is no
longer taking Aricept
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 25 mcg by mouth
daily
.
# PROPHYLAXIS: Subcutaneous Heparin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 69066**],

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were hospitalized
with community acquired pneumonia. During your stay your
pneumonia was treated with antibiotics and your cough/breathing
improved. During your stay you also were found to have an acute
change in your kidney function secondary to dehydration. This
change in your kidney function was reversed with intravenous
fluids. At discharge you will continue an oral antibiotic and
follow up with both your primary care physician and [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
nephrologist for further evaluation of your kidney function.

You finished your antibiotic course while in the hospital. No
changes were made to your medical regimen.

Followup Instructions:
You have the following appointments:
You have an appointment to see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] nurse
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3639**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69067**] on [**2-5**] at 8:00am
Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 721**].
