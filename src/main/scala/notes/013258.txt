operation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old man with a
pituitary adenoma resection in [**2084**], and hypertension, who
was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for evaluation of
a left parietal occipital lesion with edema and minimal
hemorrhage with a midline shift on CT.  He is also status
[**2105-8-18**], from [**Hospital3 **].  He was noted to be
hypoxic and short of breath in room air postoperatively.  He
was ruled out for myocardial infarction, VQ scan and was sent
for pulmonary function tests after discharge.

At the pulmonary function laboratory, he was found to be
confused, saturating at 86%.  Head CT emergently done showed
the above lesion in the parietal occipital area.  He was
started on Decadron intravenously and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for:
1.  Nonsecreting microadenoma of the pituitary, status post
resection in [**2084**].
2.  Pigmented villonodular synovitis.
3.  Status post transurethral resection of prostate in [**2084**].
4.  Secondary hypothyroidism.
5.  Secondary adrenal insufficiency.
6.  Chronic insomnia.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Obesity.
9.  Status post knee arthroscopy [**2105-8-15**].
10. Status post hemorrhoidectomy [**2105-8-18**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
2.  Dilantin 100 mg t.i.d.
3.  Diltiazem 100 mg q.d.
4.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg q.d.
5.  Accupril 40 mg q.d.
6.  Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously q6hours.
7.  Pepcid 20 mg intravenously q12ours.
8.  Synthroid 0.125 q.d.
9.  Nitroglycerin paste.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife of 53 years.  He
was smoking a pack a day for thirty years and quit thirty
years ago.  He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.   He
is a retired electrician.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient has not had any weight loss,
no night sweats, no fever or chills, no difficulty talking,
no chest pain, no abdomen pain or diarrhea, no constipation,
no bloody stools, no trouble with urination, no numbness or
tingling.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 98.9,
blood pressure 108/64, pulse 66, respiratory rate 20, 96% on
two liters nasal cannula.  The patient is pleasantly
interactive, no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat was grossly normal.  Pulmonary is clear to
auscultation bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Neurologically,
cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  The patient is
able to move all four extremities.  Pulses 2+ in upper and
lower extremities and no lower extremity edema.  No rashes.
The patient was alert and appropriate.  He was oriented to
person, place and time.

HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted for a new mass and lesion of
the left parietal occipital lobe.  The patient was admitted
to the neurosurgical team in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
and followed by neurosurgery.

On hospital day three, the patient had a left parietal
occipital craniotomy that showed a high grade glioma.  He was
continued on the Decadron and did well postoperatively.  On
[**2105-8-27**], the patient was transferred to the floor.  He was
noted to be hypoxic the following day and pulmonary team was
consulted for hypoxia, shortness of breath and tachypnea.  At
that point, he was readmitted to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit for poor saturation and had an arterial blood gases of
7.5, 33, 44, 24 and 0, and was given BiPAP treatment for
about forty-five minutes per day.  At that time, he had a
normal CT angiogram and chest x-ray.

On [**2105-8-30**], the patient was transferred back to the floor,
continued on Decadron taper, had improved oxygen saturation
and was continued on his antihypertensive medications.  On
the floor, the patient continued to have low oxygen
saturation into the 80s on 100% nonrebreather almost every
night, usually would improve on own and was helped with some
BiPAP.

The CT angiogram again was negative and lower extremity
noninvasive studies were negative.  Bubble echocardiogram was
performed that showed an aneurysmal interatrial septal shunt
with a right to left shunt but a right heart cath showed
that there was no increase in left atrial saturation with
oxygen and VQ scan was negative.  It was decided by the
pulmonary team after multiple examinations and days of notes
and discussions that it was OK to tolerate an oxygen
saturation over 86% in this gentleman.It was felt that
atelectasis could be part of the issue ? sleep apnea or occult
lung disease.

His issues throughout his hospital stay included:
1.  Hypoxia of unclear etiology.  He was discharged home on
oxygen and told to get some pulmonary function tests.
2.  Hemorrhoids that flared and were improved with Anusol.
3.  High grade glioma brain tumor.  The patient will be
following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and continue on Dilantin and
Decadron.
4.  Endocrine, he was continued on Synthroid and hydrocortisone

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Anusol.
2.  Colace 100 mg t.i.d.
3.  Dilantin 100 mg t.i.d.
4.  Hydrocortisone 20 mg in the morning, 10 mg at night.
5.  Levoxyl 125 mcg q.d.
6.  Oxygen.
7.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
8.  Xanax 0.25 mg b.i.d. p.r.n.

The patient will be following up with oncology and pulmonary
as well as primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3321**].
