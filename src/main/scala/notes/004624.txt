Chief Complaint:
Fevers, hypotension, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82 M w DM, CHF, CRF, recent AKA who was transferred from
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after he was noted to be unresponsive to verbal
stimuli with the following vital signs:
100.9 120s 90-92% on 2L NC.
.
In the ambulance the patient was placed on a NRB with sat 100%.

He was given 650 mg APAP.
Vital signs in the ED: 102.3 132 81/54 93% on RA (98-99% on 3L)

.
He was noted to have minimal purulent drainage from staples of
AKA which was sent for culture. Pt was awake but nonverbal and
unresponsive to verbal stimuli. A rigt hip wound/opening 4 cm in
length was noted; culture was sent. His skin was noted to be hot
to touch.
.
In the ED, a CXR was performed that was negative for acute
cardiopulmonary process. Medications and interventions in the
ED:
- Empiric levaquin
- Vancomycin to cover for likely SSI
- 2 L NS
- Blood cultures x2
- EKG: ST at 120s, inferior Q waves, TWI & STD anteriorly
- SC CVL placed (confirmed by CXR)
.
Initially labwork revaled lactate of 4.0. He remained
hypotensive approx 70/40 despite 2 L NS. Levophed started at
0455. Repeat lactate at 0502 was 3.1.
.

   URINE CULTURE (Pending):

Imaging:
TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. Left ventricular cavity size could not be determined
(no parasternal views available) but was visually normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed secondary to hypo to akinesis of the distal segments
of the LV, akinesis of the apex, and dyskinesis of the basal
inferior and infero-lateral walls. The remaining segments are
hyperdynamic (LVEF= 35-40 %). A small (0.6 cm) sessile,
pedunculated, mobile structure is seen in the apex of the left
ventricle most likely c/w a thrombus, although a prominenent
trabeculation cannot be excluded . Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Poor image quality. No pericardial effusion.
Moderate regional and global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Possible small left ventricular
apical thrombus. No significant valvular disease.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2128-5-7**] 3:26 AM
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacity likely
represents
atelectasis rather than focal consolidation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2128-5-7**] 4:53 AM
Left subclavian catheter tip is in the upper SVC. There is no
evident
pneumothorax. There are persistent low lung volumes with
bilateral
atelectasis, larger on the left side. Cardiomediastinal contours
are
unchanged. The stomach is very distended. There is no pleural
effusion.
Sternal wires are aligned.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2128-5-7**] 5:16 AM
FINDINGS: There is minimal dependent atelectasis at the lung
bases. Diffuse
multivessel coronary artery disease is present. The liver
enhances
homogeneously. No focal liver lesions are identified. The portal
veins are
patent. The gallbladder is decompressed. The pancreas is mildly
atrophic.
The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Several cysts
are seen in
both kidneys, the largest have simple fluid attenuation. The
kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. There is no
ascites. No
abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy is present. The stomach
is distended
with air. The small and large bowel are of normal caliber and
appearance.

PELVIS: There is a large amount of formed stool in the distal
sigmoid colon
and rectum, the wall of which is mildly thickened. A normal
air-filled
appendix is seen in the right lower quadrant. There is no free
pelvic fluid.
There is no inguinal or abdominal adenopathy. There are no
concerning lytic
or sclerotic bone lesions. Several bilateral gluteal granulomas
are noted.
Subcutaneous soft tissue nodules are noted in the left abdomen.
Correlate
with subcutaneous drug injection.
