Atrial pacing. Probable prior inferior infarction. Long QTc
interval.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-2-8**] atrial pacing is now
evident.
Q-T interval is slightly shorter. The other findings are
similar.

Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%
Mitral Valve - Peak Velocity:  1.4 m/sec
Mitral Valve - Mean Gradient:  4 mm Hg

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2174-2-3**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Torn mitral chordae. No MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**12-3**]+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Torn
mitral chordae are present. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: No significant pericardial effusion.
Normally-functioning mitral valve bioprosthesis. Preserved
global biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-2-3**],
stenotic mitral valve has been replaced with a bioprosthesis.
Right ventricular function has improved and pulmonary pressures
are lower. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Underwent cardiac catherization for evaluation prior to starting
dofetilide.  She was started on dofetilide and underwent
surgical evaluation for mitral valve stenosis.  On [**2-10**] she was
brought to the operating room where she underwent a mitral valve
replacement, MAZE procedure and left atrial appendage ligation.
Please see operative report for surgical details. She received
vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.  She was transferred
to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic montioring.  In the
