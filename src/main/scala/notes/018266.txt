History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 61 yo female with PMH of metastatic ovarian CA and
recently diagnosed DVT on lovenox presents with right sided CP
and SOB to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] found to have a large right pulmonary
artery PE and pulmonary infaract as well as several small PE's
in right lower pulmonary artery as well as left lower lobe.  Of
note, she was seen in Heme/onc clinic on [**5-16**] and was found to
have a RLE DVT and was started on lovenox.  She received a dose
of pemetrexed on [**5-21**] and was diagnosed with a UTI and started on
ciprofloxacin. The morning of admission, she developed acute
right-sided CP radiating to the right flank and right back with
SOB.  She presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and was found to have

taxol in [**2187**], doxil 6 cycles in [**2188**]. Her CA-125 began to
increase and she was then started on 8 more cycles of doxil. She
was then started on tamoxifen. Most recently she was started on
gemcitabine of which she completed 1 cycle last dose on [**4-30**].
She completed radiation on [**4-6**]. Given that she seemed to be
progressing through these therapies she received first dose of

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT head : 1. No acute intracranial process.
2. No evidence of edema to suggest an underlying mass lesion.
However, of note, CT is not as sensitive as MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 54340**] of
intracranial metastatic disease.
.
CTA and CT abd/pelvis:

1. LARGE CENTRAL RIGHT MAIN PULMONARY EMBOLI.  THERE IS FLOW
DISTAL TO THE LARGE CENTRAL THROMBUS.  FAIRLY EXTENSIVE EMBOLI
ARE NOTED IN THE  RIGHT LOWER PULMONARY ARTERY AS WELL.  Wedge
shaped consolidation in right lower lobe concerning for
infarctionTHERE ARE SMALL LEFT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY ARTERIAL
EMBOLI.

2. FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSE METASTATIC DISEASE WITH
NUMEROUS METASTASIS THROUGHOUT THE LIVER. MEDIASTINAL AND HILAR
ADENOPATHY AND A LARGE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT PELVIC MASS.

3. DELAYED EXCRETION WITHIN THE RIGHT KIDNEYS WITH SEVERE
HYDRONEPHROSIS AND CORTICAL THINNING.  THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE
RIGHT KIDNEY IS BEING CAUSED BY THE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT PELVIC
MASS.

4. CHOLELITHIASIS.

5. SIGMOID DIVERTICULOSIS.

6. MILD ANASARCA AND MILD ASCITES
.
CXR [**2192-5-27**] - The cardiac size is within normal limits. Tortuous
aorta is present. Left lung is clear. Some opacities are present
within the right lower lobe which would be more characteristic
for aspiration pneumonia than for pulmonary embolus. The known
pulmonary metastases are not positively identified.

IMPRESSION: Opacities in right lower lobe not particularly
characteristics for pulmonary embolus.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61 yo female with metastatic ovarian cancer with recently
diagnosed DVT now with large right main pulmonary artery PE and
pulmonary infarct and small bilateral lower lobe PEs despite
anticoagulation with lovenox now s/p IVC filter placement
.
# PE: The patient presented with a large R main pulmonary artery
PE despite lovenox therapy. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] the pt was
taken to IR for placement of an IVC filter. She was started on a
heparin gtt and transfered to the ICU for monitoring given her
large clot burden. The pt remained HD stable overnight and
