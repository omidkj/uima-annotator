ADDENDUM:  This is an addenum for discharge summary #[**Numeric Identifier 50173**]
for admission date [**2194-12-2**] to [**2194-12-30**].

1.  ENDOCARDITIS:  The patient remained afebrile with a
stabilized white blood cell count for the remainder of his
hospitalization.  Surveillance blood cultures taken on
[**2194-12-25**] showed no growth to date at the time of this
dictation.  Previous blood cultures prior to [**2194-12-18**] were
all negative and the last positive blood cultures were
[**2194-12-9**].  The sensitivities on the Enterococcus for
aminoglycoside sensitivities returned and the species were
found to be resistant to aminoglycosides.  Given these
findings, the Infectious Disease staff recommended the
addition of IV ceftriaxone for synergistic treatment of
Enterococcal endocarditis.  This treatment was added on
[**2194-12-26**].

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] is to continue on IV ceftriaxone and penicillin G
for approximately six weeks.  He is to continue the
antibiotics and they should not be stopped prior to valve
surgery.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in
the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for further evaluation of
his mitral valve and surgical treatment and valve
replacement.

2.  IV ANTIBIOTICS:  As above, the patient had a right PICC
line which was replaced twice during the remainder of his
hospitalization due to a defective lumen and accidental
withdrawal of the catheter.  He is to continue on six
additional weeks of IV penicillin and ceftriaxone as above.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient continued to
periodically enter atrial fibrillation.  He was continued on
metoprolol and digoxin.  A digoxin level on hospital day
number 23 was found to be 0.5 and subtherapeutic.  Based on
this, the digoxin was dosed to 125 micrograms every day,
increased from the every other day dosing he had been
receiving.  In addition, on [**2194-12-29**], the day prior to
discharge, based on continued atrial fibrillation and heart
rates in the 80s to 90s, his dose of metoprolol was increased
to 75 mg twice a day.

Cardiology continued to follow the patient throughout his
hospitalization.  They suggested the potential addition of
Amiodarone for additional antiarrhythmic properties; however,
based on his relative stability on the current regimen,
Amiodarone was not added.  His anticoagulation was held
following his fall and subsequent subdural hematoma.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] from the Neurosurgery Department was consulted
for the duration of withholding anticoagulation.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 50174**] recommendations were to withhold anticoagulation
for at least ten days.  At the time of this dictation, his
anticoagulation has continued to be held given potential for
surgery.  Further follow-up with Neurology or Neurosurgery is
recommended prior to anticoagulation following heart valve
replacement.

4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient's heart failure
was thought to be secondary to mitral regurgitation and he
was initially continued on his ACE inhibitor; however, due to
episode of hypotension, his ACE inhibitor was held in order
to increase forward pressures and allow further diuresis
during hemodialysis.  His dose of metoprolol, however, was
increased, as above, as well as his digoxin.  His dyspnea and
tachypnea remained continually improved for the remainder of
his hospitalization and during the final eight days of his
hospitalization, he had no events of oxygen desaturation.  He
was weaned off of oxygen by nasal cannula and at the time of
this dictation, he is stable with oxygen saturations of 94%
on 2 liters nasal cannula.

5.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE:  The patient continued to be
followed by the Hemodialysis Team.  He was dialyzed
approximately every other day and 2.5 to 3.5 kilogram volumes
were removed during each session.  He tolerated the dialysis
with occasional episodes of hypotension, however.  His right
IJ non-tunneled dialysis catheter was ultimately found to be
inadequate for long-term use and a right tunneled IJ was
placed by the Interventional Radiology Service without
complication.  He is to continue to use this site for
dialysis and will continue to be followed by the Nephrology
Service for dialysis treatments with a schedule to be
arranged by their service.

6.  BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA:  The patient's hematocrit remained
stable and he received no additional blood products for the
remainder of his hospitalization.  His goal is to keep the
hematocrit above 30.  In addition, he has chronic anemia
likely due to chronic renal failure and received Epogen shots
at hemodialysis.

7.  SUBDURAL HEMATOMA:  The hematoma initially diagnosed
following his fall was felt to be stable.  He had no other
sequelae of neurologic intracranial bleeding.  As above, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] from the Neurosurgery Department recommended
withholding anticoagulation for approximately ten days for
the atrial fibrillation.  Further recommendations are
required prior to anticoagulation for the mitral valve
replacement.

8.  DELIRIUM/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  During the remainder of
his hospitalization, the patient became increasingly more
alert and oriented.  He was able to have appropriate
conversations.  His mother who visited him often felt that he
was returned to his baseline mental status on the three
remaining days of his hospitalization.

9.  LOWER BACK PAIN:  After the initial evaluation, no
further complaints of low back pain continued for the
remainder of his hospitalization.

10.  INCREASING WHITE COUNT:  The patient's white blood
count, as above, remained stable and the patient was
continued on Flagyl for Clostridium difficile toxin positive
stool.  He is to continue on Flagyl during the course of his
penicillin as discontinuing Flagyl while on penicillin would
likely lead to return of the Clostridium difficile infection.

11.  NEW ONSET RASH:  No further problems with this rash
persisted after its initial resolution.

12.  ELEVATED INR:  The patient was continued with vitamin K
and remained with stable INR after initial treatment.

13.  HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA:  The patient was treated initially
with aluminum hydroxide and his phosphate level returned to
[**Location 213**].  He will receive aluminum hydroxide as needed for
hyperphosphatemia and will continue to have electrolytes
managed during his hemodialysis.

14.  POOR DENTITION:  The patient was evaluated by the Dental
Service and was noted to have poor dentition and would likely
benefit from tooth extraction prior to cardiac surgery.  Due
to the patient's inability to tolerate the Panorex testing at
the time of his discharge, he will require further
rehabilitation prior to the Panorex examination and further
oral surgery consultation.  It is still felt that he would
benefit from tooth extraction prior to cardiac surgery.

15.  SPLENIC INFARCT VERSUS ABSCESS:  During a CT of the
abdomen for source of infection, it was noted that the
patient had a small infarct in the spleen as well as an area
of lucency which could not be ruled out for abscess.  Given
the lack of clinical signs and/or radiologic signs of splenic
abscess, it was felt that a repeat CT scan in two weeks
following discharge would be recommended as follow-up to
evaluate for progression of an abscess or the lesion.

On [**2194-12-30**], hospital day number 28, the patient was deemed
in stable condition for discharge to an extended care
facility.

assistance, requiring minimal oxygen by nasal cannula and at
