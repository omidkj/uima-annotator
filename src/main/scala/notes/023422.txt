Test Date: [**2124-8-24**]


Reason for referral:
This patient is referred by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3315**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation of gi bleeding

Procedure Data:
Height: 68.0 Inches. Weight: 150 Lbs. Waist: 34.0 Inches. Build:
Normal. Gastric Passage Time: 0h 10m. Small Bowel Passage Time:
6h 7m.

Procedure Info & Findings:
1. Poor preparation in the majority of the small bowel

Summary & Recommendations:

Summary: 1. Poor preparation in the small bowel precluded a
complete evaluation of the small bowel 2. otherwise Normal small
bowel capsule endoscopy

Recommendations: 1. Follow HCT/HGB. 2. Follow Up with referring
physician

Small Bowel Enteroscopy:
Findings: Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
jejunum:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
ileum: Not examined.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Normal mucosa in the stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Normal mucosa in the jejunum
Additional notes: No source of bleeding found in upper GI tract
to mid jejunum. All sites well visualized. Will procede with
inpatient capsule study at this point. Continue PPI.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acute blood loss anemia / GI bleed: Admission hct 16.  He was
admitted to the ICU and transfused PRBC and FFP. EGD done in ICU
identified no source of bleeding. Colonoscopy done in [**1-21**]
showed diverticulosis, rectal angioectasia, and grade I hemorr.
Capsule endoscopy was the performed. Though the prep was fair,
no bleeding lesions were identified. The Hemoglobin remained
stable and at that time anti-coagulation was restarted with IV
heparin drip and warfarin. (for mechanical valve). The bleed was
presumed to be precipitated by ASA, Plavix, and a
supra-therapeutic INR.

After discussion between Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], hospitalist attending and
the patient's cardiologist, plavix was stopped as the stents
were placed in [**1-21**]. ASA and warfarin continued.
.
2) AVR/St. Jude's valve:
- Careful anticoagulation was started and INR goal of 2.5-3.5
was achieved. IV heparin coverage was maintained during this
time. No signs of bleeding noticed and hematocrit remained
stable.

3) CAD s/p stent:
After, initially holding the meds, all meds were restarted
slowly and titrated to the hoem dose. On ASA. Plavix stopped
(refer above) Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed that Plavix should be d/c'd for
now given s/p 6 mos stenting (cypher, drug-eluting) and
life-threatening GI bleed.
.
4) Diastolic CHF (EF 60% 1/06): Remained stable, medications
continued.
.
5) H/o Afib: currently in sinus rhythm; continue beta-blocker
and amiodarone. On Anticoagulation.
.
6) Postherpetic neuralgia: Left neck; oxycodone prn, lidocaine
patch
.
7) h/o AAA: stable AAA without any evidence of rupture /
compromise on CTA [**4-20**]. No abdmonial pain or any other symptoms.
