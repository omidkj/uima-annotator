Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Biliary obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic retrograde pancreaticogram (ERCP)x 2
Endoscopic ultrasound
Transjugular liver biopsy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59 year old male with a history of CAD,
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation not on Coumadin, Hodgkin's disease in remission,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and ventricular tachycardia
s/p ICD implant in [**2123**].  He was transferred from [**Hospital3 29818**] for possible ERCP after having an elevated TBili and
RUQ ultrasound showing borderline intrahepatic biliary dilation
and borderline CBD dilation 6 cm.
.
He was recently discharged home from rehab on [**2129-7-26**] after a
one month stay following a brief hospitalization for a CHF
exacerbation.  On the day he returned home, he developed severe
bilateral neck pain and stiffness which prompted him to present
to the [**Hospital3 2568**] ED.  The pain was constant, worsened with
palpation or head movement, and not exertional.  On exam in the
ED, it was localized to the SCM muscles and thought to be muscle
spasm.  He was given Ativan 5 mg PO x2 and Tylenol 975 mg PO.
His neck pain improved, and he was about to be discharged, but
he became hypotensive with SBP down to 66/34.  He was given IV
fluids with improvement in his pressures.  He was found to be
guaiac positive and his Hct was down about 6 points from his
prior admission.  Labs showed creatinine 1.5, Hct 27.3, and
D-dimer 906.  There was concern for both PE and GI bleeding, so
he was admitted.
.
He had a V/Q scan on [**2129-7-27**] which was negative.  He was
transfused a total of 3 units PRBCs with his Hct remaining at
34-35 afterwards.  Cardiology felt that his Troponin leak was
due to demand ischemia.  He had several episodes of rapid Afib
requiring rate control.  He did report some chest pain during
one episode, and noted that he had been having intermittent
chest discomfort over the last few weeks at rehab which was
attributed to GERD.  His blood pressure was labile and would
drop to the 80s-90s systolic at night.
.
Labs on [**2129-7-29**] showed ALT 51, AST 33, ALK 75, TBili 4.4, DBili
3.4, and INR 1.7 not on coumadin.  Subsequent abdominal US on
[**7-29**] showed borderline intrahepatic biliary dilation and CBD
dilation 6.5 mm.  Abdominal CT on [**2129-7-30**] showed stranding and
inflammatory changes adjacent to the pancreatic head.  He denied
any abdominal pain or other GI symptoms, but did note several
days of diarrhea at rehab ust before discharge which was worked
up for C diff but negative.  MRCP was not possible due to his
ICD.  He was treated with empiric Flagyl and Levofloxacin given
the concern for colitis noted on CT.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and possible ERCP.  Prior to
transfer, he reportedly looked clinically well.
.
Once in the ICU, he reported feeling fairly well with few
specific complaints besides his chronic medical issues.  He
reports that the neck pain that initially brought him to [**Hospital3 10959**] has completely resolved.  He has not noticed any bloody,
black, or tarry stool.  He does not have any abdominal pain or
recent change in bowel habits.  He denies any chest pain,
pressure, palpitations, cough, or SOB.   He denies any
lightheadedness or dizziness.  He has chronic lower extremity
edema which he thinks is slightly increased from baseline.  He
has several decubitus ulcers which developed during his recent
rehab stay.  He denies ever having similar skin issues in the
past.  He has chronic weakness of the left arm from his
inclusion body myositis.

Pertinent Results:
TTE (Complete) Done [**2129-8-1**] Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position (suggestive of RV pressure overload). The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
probably mitral valve prolapse (not well seen but suggested). An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
