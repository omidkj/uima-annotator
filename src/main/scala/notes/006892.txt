67 M w/ CAD s/p MI [**56**] yrs ago, ischemic CM, EF 10-15%, VT s/p
ICD placement in '[**26**], s/p upgrade in '[**31**], had stem cell therapy
in [**Country **] in [**6-23**], PVD, resented [**8-25**] with recurrent firing of
his ICD.  Received VT ablation and ICD reprograming.  He was

earlier this am.  Here for possible ICD generator change +/- AV

resected.  On last visit, total of 7 shocks, not consistently
associated with any activity.  First 3 were not associated with

Pertinent Results:
[**2137-2-13**] ECG:  A-V paced rhythm, no significant change since
previous tracing of [**2136-9-14**]
.
[**2137-2-15**] CT ABD:  Right-sided rectus sheath hemorrhage extending
along the oblique muscles as well. There is no
retroperitoneal/intraperitoneal extent of hemorrhage.
.
[**2137-2-15**] ECG:  A-V sequentially paced rhythm with capture.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-2-13**] the paced interval
has decreased.
.
[**2137-2-16**] ECG:  The rhythm is likely atrial fibrillation with
ventricular pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-2-15**]
atrial paicng is not evident.
.
[**2137-2-17**] ECG:  Atrial fibrillation and ventricular paced rhythm
with capture. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-2-16**] no
diagnostic interim change.
.
[**2137-2-18**] CT CHEST:  1) No findings to indicate amiodarone lung
toxicity.
2) Left circumflex artery stent and calcification of the distal
anterior and septal left ventricular walls.  3) Emphysema

Brief Hospital Course:
.
EP:  In the EP lab [**2-14**] the Pt had [**4-26**] different VTs, two of
which were ablated, one of which was not well tolerated.  The Pt
was on dopamine and neosynephrine during the case secondary to
hypotension.  During the case he also had Afib which was
cardioverted.  He was placed in the CCU overnight and dopamine
was weaned off.  He returned to the EP lab [**2-15**] for an ICD
generator ([**Company 1543**]) replacement w/o complication.  Rhythm post
procedure was AF.
.
PAF:  Pt was placed on heparin IV for anticoagulation
pre-procedure and continued on carvedilol for rate control.  Pt
was in Afib post generator change and cardioverted.  digoxin and
amiodarone levels were checked and meds dosed accordingly.  CT
chest performed, and did not show any findings suggestive of
amiodarone toxicity.  Pt had asymtomatic runs of VT noted on
telemetry throughout the hospitalization.  His final ECG showed
atrial fibrillation and ventricular paced rhythm with capture
[**2-17**].
.
HEMATOMA:  Pt developed a right-sided rectus sheath hemorrhage
extending along the oblique muscles post [**2-15**] procedure.  Pt was
transferred to the CCU, heparin and coumadin held, received
PRBCs with stabilization of Hct.  Coumadin was restarted after
Hct stabilization.  Pt was seen by rehabilitation before
discharge
.
CAD: no angina.  Continued on atorvastatin, isosorbide
mononitrate (Extended Release), and aspirin at time of
discharge.
.
CHF:  euvolemic throughout stay.  Continued on furosemide,
spironolactone, carvedilol, digoxin at time of discharge.
.
GOUT:  Pt with gouty flare noted on [**2-13**], started on colchicine,
discharged on allopurinol once gout resolves.
.
