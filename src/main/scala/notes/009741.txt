HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78-year-old
patient who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2109-6-10**]
complaining of a two week history of increasing shortness of
breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, as well as
acute onset of chest discomfort. He ruled out for myocardial
infarction at that time. However, he has a significant past
medical history with a history of coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2097**]. He was ultimately transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2109-6-14**] to undergo a
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for known coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2097**],
hypertension, peripheral vascular disease,
hypercholesterolemia, question of a seizure in the past and
he has been maintained on Dilantin since that time. He has
also had a transient ischemic attack from an embolic stroke
and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He also has a significant
alcohol abuse history and states that he has decreased his
alcohol intake recently to three drinks a day. The patient
was admitted to the [**Hospital3 3583**], ruled out for myocardial
infarction and did transfer here on [**2109-6-14**] on the
following medications.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Quinapril 20 mg b.i.d.
2. Dilantin 130 mg b.i.d.
3. Lipitor 40 mg q d.
4. Imdur 60 mg in the morning and 60 mg at 3:00 p.m.
5. Betoptic eyedrops 0.25 percent in the left eye twice a
   day.
6. Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q d.
7. Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q d.
8. Multivitamins one p.o. q d.
9. Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.
10.      Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d.
11.      Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
12.      He had also been on Coumadin but this was being held
   because of his need for a cardiac catheterization.
13.      He was also transferred to us on two liters nasal
   cannula supplemental oxygen.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission to
the hospital was essentially unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  Essentially unremarkable preoperatively.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory and this showed severe aortic stenosis, as well as
three-vessel coronary artery disease. Previous left internal
mammary artery graft is widely patent.

This patient underwent CT scan of the chest, as well as
carotid artery studies in his preoperative work-up. These
were felt to be noncontributory to his operative course and
he underwent a redo sternotomy with an aortic valve
replacement, a 25 Paramount tissue valve, by [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 40324**], M.D. on [**2109-6-17**]. Postoperatively, he was
transported from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit in good condition on dobutamine, Neo-Synephrine
and propofol intravenous drip.

On postoperative day one, the patient was weaned from
mechanical ventilation and successfully extubated on the
night of surgery. On postoperative day one, he remained
hemodynamically stable, remained on dobutamine intravenously
continuous drip. This was very slowly weaned down over the
next 24 hours and ultimately discontinued by the end of
postoperative day one. The patient was placed on intravenous
amiodarone, which was ultimately converted to oral amiodarone
on postoperative day two. This was for postoperative atrial
fibrillation. He also had some preexisting atrial
fibrillation preoperatively. His chest tubes were removed on
postoperative day two and he was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26 percent. The
patient continued to progress from a pulmonary toilet
standpoint requiring a fair amount of pulmonary toilet and
assistance with increased mobility.

On postoperative day three, he remained in atrial
fibrillation while his blood pressure was stable and his
cardiac output and index also remained stable. An
Electrophysiology consult was obtained due to continued
atrial fibrillation with the thought that he would tolerate
it better from a hemodynamic standpoint if he were able to be
converted to a normal sinus rhythm. He attempted
cardioversion which was initially successful. The patient was
converted to a sinus rhythm with a rate of 55. However, he
subsequently reverted back to atrial fibrillation later that
day.

On [**2109-6-23**], the patient was transferred out of the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit to the telemetry floor. His epicardial
pacing wires had been discontinued. He remained stable from a
hemodynamic standpoint. He had begun anticoagulation with
Coumadin by that point and remained in atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day seven, the patient's INR was noted to be
3.5 and his Coumadin was subsequently held due to an elevated
INR. His physical examination was unremarkable. The patient
was progressing, albeit quite slowly. From a Physical Therapy
standpoint, he still required much assistance to ambulate,
but had remained hemodynamically stable in atrial
fibrillation. His Lopressor was resumed on postoperative day
eight. It had been stopped previously because of the slow
ventricular response, as well as slow sinus rhythm for the
brief period that he was in sinus rhythm, but his rate in
atrial fibrillation had been in the high 70s to low 80s with
a blood pressure in the 140s by postoperative day eight and
the Lopressor was resumed. The patient remained on amiodarone
as well, however, in atrial fibrillation. His INR today on
postoperative day eight remains elevated to 4.2. His Coumadin
was held yesterday, as well as today and needs to be
rechecked tomorrow on [**2109-6-26**]. If his INR has begun to
decrease, he will be stable and ready to be discharged to
rehabilitation to progress with cardiac rehabilitation and
physical therapy.

Physical examination today on [**2109-6-25**] is as follows.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurologically, the patient is alert
and oriented with no apparent deficits. Pulmonary
examination:  His lung are clear to auscultation bilaterally,
although slightly decreased in the left base. His coronary
examination is irregular. His sternum is stable. His
incisions are clean, dry and intact. His abdomen is benign.
His extremities are warm without edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  The most recent laboratory values are from
today, [**2109-6-25**], which reveal a white blood cell count of
8.2 thousand, a hematocrit of 34.0, platelet count 249,
sodium 131, potassium 4.2, chloride 93, CO2 of 29, BUN 7,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 110. His weight today is 60.3. His
preoperative weight was 64.5 kg.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Dilantin 130 mg p.o. q d.
2. Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Amiodarone 200 mg b.i.d. for one week, then he should
   decrease the dose to 200 mg q d for two weeks or until
   discontinued by the patient's primary cardiologist, Dr.
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q d times seven days.
5. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q d times seven days. This
   is to then be reevaluated by the patient's primary care
   physician or cardiologist for further need of diuresis.
6. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Aspirin enteric coated 81 mg p.o. q d.
8. Niferex 150 mg p.o. q d.
9. Ascorbic acid 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10.      Multivitamin one tablet p.o. q d.
11.      Coumadin, which was held on [**2109-6-24**] and
   [**2109-6-25**] for an elevated INR. His INR will be checked on
   the morning of [**2109-6-26**] and the Coumadin dose
   determined. The patient should have frequent INR checks
   while in rehabilitation and have dosing to target INR of
   2.0-2.5. He should probably have another INR checked on
   [**2109-6-27**] or [**2109-6-28**] at the latest. He will continue
   his Coumadin dosing.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease.

Aortic stenosis.

Atrial fibrillation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good. The patient is discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

FOLLOW UP:  He should follow-up with [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5662**], M.D.
in approximately five weeks. He should follow-up with Dr.
