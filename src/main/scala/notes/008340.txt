Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
dizziness / hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 55-yo man w/ recent large ICH and DVT s/p IVC filter
not on anticoagulation, who presents from rehab with
hypotension, and found to have PEs on Chest CTA at OSH as well
as increased bleeding at the site of his ICH, in the setting of
INR 1.3. The pt was doing well at [**Hospital **] Rehab but was found to be
hypotensive today, so was transferred to [**Hospital6 5016**].
There, Chest CTA revealed small PEs in the RLL, and Head CT
revealed re-bleeding at the site of the previous ICH, so he was
transferred here for Neurosurgical evaluation.

In the ED: VS - Temp 98.1F, HR 108, BP 138/94, R 25, O2-sat 98%
2L NC. He was found to have a WBC 20 with 84% PMNs, INR 1.4,
lactate 1.5, and subtherapeutic Dilantin level of 2.6. UA was
negative, CXR was clear, and Blood Cx were sent x2. ECG revealed
ST-segment changes in V4-V5, and he ruled-out for an MI with 2
sets of negative CEs. Head CT revealed a large left
frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with moderate edema
and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, with no
midline shift or evidence of herniation. Head MRI confirmed the
large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding vasogenic edema, with left-sided sulcal effacement
but no evidence for uncal herniation or transtentorial
herniation; it also revealed bifrontal subdural hematomas as
well as subdural hematomas along the interhemispheric cistern
and the falx; there was no evidence for infarction. He was seen
by Neurosurgery, who recommended repeat CT neck / brain and CTA
brain to assess the vasculature. He was continued on Dilantin,
started on steroids, and coumadin was continued to be held. He
is being admitted to the ICU for close neurological monitoring

Past Medical History:
- Pt had MVA [**2189-8-26**] after cough-related syncopal event.
Unconscious at the scene, admitted to [**Hospital 12017**] Hospital. Head
CT and pan-CT were unremarkable, INR was 2.8 at the time. Within
36 hours, developed large intracerebral hematoma, MRA negative.
Coumadin was stopped. Transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab, where he has been
since.

NCHCT ([**9-10**]) - There is an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage
within the left frontoparietal lobes centered deep in the medial
subcortical white matter, measuring 5 cm AP x 3.5 cm CC x 2.3 cm
TRV. There is a moderate amount of surrounding vasogenic edema.
No discrete underlying mass is identified. There is one area
where the hemorrhage appears more heterogeneous (2:24), and this
may be due to swirling of blood (perhaps acute on chronic
hemorrhage) or an underlying mass. There is no evidence of
intraventricular extension of hemorrhage. There is mild mass
effect on the left lateral ventricles. No shift of the normally
midline structures. The suprasellar and basal cisterns are
preserved. There is a small amount of mucosal thickening in the
left maxillary sinus and a mucus retention cyst in the right
axillary sinus. The mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized
and aerated. A spongy lucent lesion in the left parietal bone
likely represents arachnoid granulations. There is no soft
tissue abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with moderate edema and mild mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. No midline shift or evidence of herniation.
The location of the hemorrhage is atypical for hypertension, and
the acuity of the bleed in unusual two weeks post-contusion
unless this represents hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct,
or rebleeding. An underlying mass, AV malformation, and amyloid
angiopathy are also considerations and could be evaluated for by
CTA or MRI.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: It would be helpful to compare
to prior studies. The hemorrhage on this study does not appear
acute, given the extensive surrounding edema, but there might be
rebleeding into an established hematoma. I agree that the
etiology is not apparent, and that further work up is needed to
distinguish among the diagonstic possibilities listed.

CXR ([**9-11**]) - The lungs are clear, with no evidence of pneumonia.
No effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
normal.

Head MRI ([**9-11**]) - (PFI) Large left frontoparietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema
previously seen on CT examination. There is left-sided sulcal
effacement but no evidence for uncal herniation or
transtentorial herniation. There are also bifrontal subdural
hematomas as well as subdural hematomas along the
interhemispheric cistern and the falx. There is no evidence for
infarction. CTA or MRA could be used to further evaluate
intracerebral vasculature.

MRA intra and extra cranial vessels
1. Unremarkable cranial and cervical MRA, with no flow-limiting
stenosis or
aneurysm larger than 3 mm in diameter.
2. No evidence of vascular abnormality in the region of the
large left
parieto-occipital evolving h
