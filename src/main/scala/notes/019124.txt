Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: LA not well visualized. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
LAA. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: PFO is present. Left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic
function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. The patient received antibiotic
prophylaxis. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Houseofficer caring for the patient was notified of the results
by e-mail. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass
study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
Preserved biventricular systolic function post cpb. Anterior
wall is improved. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation..

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2193-4-26**] where he underwent coronary artery
bypass x 3.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well
and post-operatively was transferred to CVICU in good condition
for invasive monitoring and recovery.  POD 1 found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  He was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support at this time.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued in the usual fashion without
complication.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor on POD 1.  Beta blocker was started and the patient was
gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight.  The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with post-operative
strength and mobility.  Hospital course was uneventful and the
patient was discharged home in good condition on POD #4.  By the
time of discharge he was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He was
given appropriate follow up instructions.
