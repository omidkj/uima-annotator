Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old woman with a history of asthma who
presents with an asthma exacerbation.
.
The patient is an ex-smoker with PFTs in [**2168**] which showed an
FEV1 of 60% predicted and FVC of 92% predicted who was last
hospitalized in [**2173-12-1**] for asthma, COPD exacerbation, who
presented to clinic on [**2174-11-1**] with shortness of breath over the
last 7-10 days.

The patient's symptoms started out with some upper respiratory
tract symptoms of cough and cold sneeziness.  She has no
allergic symptoms, no rhinitis, watery eyes, or itchy eyes.  No
fevers or chills, sweats or weight loss.  She increased her
albuterol use from 3 to 4x/day. She also has a nebulizer at home
which she has been using about four times per day. Given her
increased respiratory difficulty, she increased her Atrovent and
cromolyn to twice a day.  She does check her peak flows at home,
and her baseline is 350.
.
In clinic she was told to use atrovent four times a day and was
put on a prednisone taper. She completed the taper on Monday and
has had increasing wheezing and shortness of breath since then.
On [**11-18**], she presented to clinic where she had a peak flow of
150 down from 350. She could barely speak without becoming short
of breath. She was sent to the ED where she was afebrile. O2 sat
was 99% on RA. She received continuous albuterol and atrovent
nebs, prednisone 60 mg po, solumedrol 125 mg IV, ciprofloxacin
500 po. Her peak flow improved to 200, but worsened off the
nebulizers.
.
She recently visited her sister in a nursing home, who had a
respiratory infection. She had the flu shot two weeks ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 year old woman with history of asthma who presented
with an asthma exacerbation. Her hospital course is as follows.
.
##  Exacerbation of severe persistent asthma:
Due to her clinical presentation the patient was admitted to the
ICU. The patient's exacerbation was thought to be secondary to
infection, given her cough and sputum production.  She was
started on azithryomycin, solumedrol 40 q8, q 2 nebs w/ prn. By
the following morning, the patient felt less short of breath but
had increased cough. A sputum sample was collected which later
grew out mod oropharyngeal flora. The patient's O2 sats 94-100%
w/ RR 22-26, peak flow improved from 200-350 (baseline). By
[**11-22**], the nebulizer treatments had spaced out to q 4, she had
finished 5 day tx of azithromycin, solumedrol was changed to
prednisone 60 daily, advair dose increased to 500/50. Other than
these changes she was maintained on her outpt meds. Her O2 was
91 on RA w/ RR 22 w/q4 nebs on [**11-22**].
.
The patient was transferred to the medicine service on [**2174-11-23**].
 She was maintained on q4 nebulizer treatments and prednisone
60mg.  At the time of discharge the patient's O2 sat had
improved to mid 90s on room air. The patient was discharged on
albuterol and atrovent nebulizers.  She instructed to spread out
these treatments so that every 3 hours she was receiving a
treatment.  She was discharged with instructions for a steroid
taper. The patient was instructed to continue taking her home
asthma meds.  At the time of discharge the patient was advised
to followup with a pulmonologist and an allergist.
.
##  DM2:
The patient's glucose levels were at times elevated to 200.  Her
glargine dose was increased to 38U at bedtime.  At discharge,
the patient was instructed to continue on glargine and use a
humalog sliding scale to monitor her glucose levels.
.
##  GERD:
The patient was maintained on a PPI, without any complications.
.
##  Left calf pain
The patient had left calf pain.  On examination, her left calf
was slightly greater than the right.  The concern was that the
patient may have had a deep venous thrombosis.  Dopplers were
done and no clot was identified.  The patient was discharged
with instructions to control her pain with acetaminophen.
.
## Elevated WBC
At the time of discharge the patient had an elevated WBC.  The
patient was on a steriod taper and had been afebrile throughout
her course.
.
##  Dispo
The patient was discharged with prescriptions for albuterol
nebulizers, atrovent nebulizers, humalog, an anti-tussant and
prednisone taper.  The patient was instructed to continue taking
her other home medications.  The importance of following up with
an allergist and pulmonologist was re-emphasized.
