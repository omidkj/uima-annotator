HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old
woman with end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who now
presents with symptoms of congestive heart disease.  The
patient has coronary risk factors of hypertension, age and
gender, with a question of hypercholesterolemia and no
episodic orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the
last week.  Episodes occurred at rest and spontaneously
resolved.  She felt slight fatigue yesterday and awoke this
morning to use the bathroom.  Upon returning to bed, she had
increasing shortness of breath and was unable to lie back,
severe orthopnea and progressive shortness of breath at rest
from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m.  Called daughter 5:00 a.m., who
tachypneic with oxygen saturation of 91% in room air,
hypertensive to 204/110 and diaphoretic.  Given sublingual
nitroglycerin times three and 40 mg of intravenous Lasix and
mild improvement, started on nitroglycerin drip and continued
improvement to oxygen saturation of 97% to 99% on 100%
nonrebreather.  The patient has no chest pain, no
palpitations, no nausea, no vomiting, no lightheadedness.  At
baseline, is very active.  Hospitalized from [**3-16**] with episodic chest pain across the chest and right
arm, was ruled out by CKs and troponin, no
electrocardiographic changes.  Exercise tolerance test was
done in [**Month (only) 116**], left ventricular ejection fraction 43%, mild
diffuse hypokinesis but no definite perfusion abnormalities
identified at level of exercise achieved, suboptimal test.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  End-stage renal disease, on
hemodialysis.  2.  Hypertension.  3.  Gastritis.  4.  History
of Helicobacter pylori.  5.  Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  6.  Status
post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Benadryl 25 mg p.o.q.h.s.,
Premarin 0.625 mg p.o.q.d., Epogen 4,000 units t.i.w.,
metoprolol 50 mg p.o.q.d., Nephrocaps one p.o.q.d., Tums four
p.o.q.d., Rocaltrol dose unknown and Tylenol p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  Vasotec (tongue swelling and anaphylactic
reaction), Minocin (ecchymosis) and aspirin (easy bruising).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her daughter
downtown. She does not use alcohol.  She has a tobacco
history of greater than 30 pack years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died at age 67 with
coronary artery disease, onset at age 60.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 96.4, blood pressure 115/50, heart rate
70, respiratory rate 16 and oxygen saturation 99% on 100%
nonrebreather.  General:  Pleasant woman, speaking
comfortably.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Mild
conjunctival pallor, anicteric sclerae, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
positive S3, jugular venous pressure to 10 cm.  Lungs:
Diffuse crackles bilaterally two-thirds of the way up with
decreased breath sounds at right base.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, unable to palpate
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  +2 dorsalis pedis
bilaterally, no edema.  Neurologic:  Grossly within normal
limits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 14.9 with 1
band, hemoglobin 15.9, hematocrit 49.4, platelet count
131,000, BUN 74, creatinine 4.7, potassium 6, recheck 5, INR
1.2, CK 104, troponin less than 0.3.  Urinalysis:  255 white
blood cells, moderate bacteria.  Chest x-ray:  Moderate
congestive heart failure with pleural effusions, right
greater than left.  Electrocardiogram:  T wave inversions in
I and AVL, 1 to 1.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in V1 through V4, could
be early repolarization; electrocardiogram number showed same
thing, T wave inversions in I and AVL with improved ST
changes and signs of heightened T waves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 84 year old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors, admitted with congestive heart
failure, which is suspicious for ischemia.  Given the sudden
onset of the congestive heart failure, it is thought that the
patient's etiology for her congestive heart failure is
diastolic failure secondary to a fast heart rate and
ischemia.  It is thought that the patient is approximately
close to her dry weight and this is not secondary to volume
overload from inadequate dialysis.  Therefore, the patient
was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit, at which point and
echocardiogram was performed which confirmed a suspicion that
the patient has decreased left ventricular function.

Later on that day, the patient improved dramatically after
dialysis.  She had approximately one kilogram removed and her
oxygenation improved dramatically.  She eventually required
only six liters on nasal cannula, saturating about 97% to
99%.  She was eventually called out to the floor.  On the
following day, she underwent a cardiac catheterization, which
showed no significant disease except for a 60% diagonal
lesion.  At this point, no further intervention was done.
There was no stent placed.  Of note, her left sided pressures
were elevated, with a wedge pressure of approximately 16, so
it was then thought that the patient was truly volume
overloaded but did not appear to have any significant
coronary artery disease.  Of note, the patient did have a
positive troponin of approximately 5, which we thought was
secondary just to congestive heart failure and not to an
acute coronary syndrome.  Therefore, the patient was taken
back to dialysis and two kilograms of fluid were removed.  It
is thought that the dry weight of this patient was grossly
over-estimated or patient may have lost muscle mass and
therefore her dry weight was dramatically over-estimated.
The patient was diuresed a total of three kilograms during
this hospital admission and improved dramatically from a
congestive heart failure standpoint.

Therefore, the clinical diagnosis thought at this time is
that the patient has systolic and diastolic dysfunction with
a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 40% and
apparent diastolic pressure with an increase E to A ratio on
echocardiogram.  Therefore, the patient was started on
hydralazine, initially 10 mg and increased up to 25 mg orally
per day, and Isordil 10 mg three times a day.  The patient
was also restarted on her beta blocker to 50 mg twice a day.
Therefore, the patient was stable upon discharge, with no
other complaints.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Hydralazine 25 mg p.o.q.i.d.
Imdur 30 mg p.o.q.d.
Benadryl q.h.s.
Premarin 0.625 mg p.o.q.d.
Epogen 4,000 mg t.i.w.
Nephrocaps.
Tums.
Rocaltrol.
Tylenol.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure.
No evidence of significant coronary artery disease on
catheterization, no interventions done.
End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, dry weight grossly
over-estimated.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable, without any
complaints.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow up with her primary care
physician within two weeks and follow up with dialysis three
times per week.
