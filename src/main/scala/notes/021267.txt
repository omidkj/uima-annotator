Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Right-sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year-old right-handed woman with a family
history of early stroke (mother in her 50s) and personal history
including DM, hypertension, and tobacco use who presented about
35 minutes after the acute onset of right hemiparesis and
aphasia
for whom a code stroke was called.  The patient's co-worker
explains that Ms. [**Known lastname **] was last known well when she laid
down
to rest (it was nap time at the nursery school where she works).

At about 2:45 pm, she stood up and fell onto a nearby table.
She
announced that she couldn't feel her right side.  The patient's
co-workers called 911 and she was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] where
a code stroke was called.

Initial NIHSS score was eight for right facial palsy (1),
absence
of movement in the right upper extremity (4), sensory alteration
in the right upper extremity (1), mild to moderate aphasia (1),
and mild dysarthria (1).  The findings were considered
concerning
for a left MCA stroke.  A non-contrast CT of the head
demonstrated a hyperdense left MCA sign.  The patient was given
t-PA within about one hour of presentation.

CT:
Comparison with the prior head CT scan reveals more extensive
hypodensity within the left lentiform nucleus, left internal
capsule and head of the left caudate nucleus, consistent with an
evolving infarct, likely involving lenticulostriate artery
territory. As was also noted on the prior MRI scan, there is a
small area of hemorrhagic conversion within this infarct
centrally, measuring up to 1 cm in diameter. There remains mild
compression of the left lateral ventricle, particularly the left
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], but there is no subfalcine herniation. No other
new pathology is seen, acknowledging that many of the images are
degraded by patient motion.

MRI:
Findings compatible with evolving left MCA territory stroke with

microhemorrhage in the left basal ganglia.

TTE:
No PFO, ASD, or cardiac source of embolism seen. Normal global
and regional biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 y.o. lady with acute left MCA stroke presented to  ER within
TPA interval and IV TPA was given 1 hour since the beginning of
symptoms at 1545. TPA without resolution of symptoms so IR
performed CTA --> complete occlusion of L common carotid which
was angioplastied; L MCA M1 thrombus angioplastied and
thrombolysed resulting in clear M1 and many of M2 branches,
though some M2 branches still occluded.

COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: F/u MRI findings compatible with evolving left MCA
territory stroke with interval hemorrhagic transformation as
evident on gradient echo sequence.  ER within TPA interval and
IV TPA was given 1 hour since the beginning of symptoms at 1545.
TPA without resolution of symptoms so IR performed CTA -->
complete occlusion of L common carotid which was angioplastied;
L MCA M1 thrombus angioplastied and thrombolysed resulting in
clear M1 and many of M2 branches, though some M2 branches still
occluded.  With patient's collateral flow pressures wehre kept
between 140 and 180.  She remained aphasic however after
intubation she began mouthing words.  She was then transferred
to the floor.  TEE showed no thrombus

Cardiovascular: Patient's EKG in SR.  A TTE was done which did
not demonstrate any PFO, A
