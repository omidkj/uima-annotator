Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: After an extensive workup in the ED, she had
activity that appeared to be a seizure, and was started on
dilantin.  She was extensively hydrated, and her hypernatremia
was corrected from 162 to 140 over the next two days.  She was
noted to be in acute renal failure, thought to be due to an
ATN-type picture.  She was also found to be hypothyroid and an
initial echo showed an EF of <10% with global LV akinesis.  She
required pressor support for her hypotension and remained
intubated for breathing support.  Her MICU course by systems is
as follows:

CV: Elevated CKs on admission but no evidence of MI from
troponins or EKG changes.  Echo on [**2188-4-14**] showed LV dysfunction
as noted above, noting EF<10% as well as 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Also
noted at that time to have a large LV thrombus as well as LAA
thrombus, for which she was started on IV heparin.  Over the
course of her MICU stay her hypotension resolved and gradually
she developed mild hypertension, for which she was started on
isordil and nifedipine.  Repeat echo performed [**2188-4-25**] shows
global LV dysfunction but improvement in LVEF to 20-25%, with
left thrombi still visible.  Her PTT has been maintained in the
55-75 range and she was started on coumadin today.  Cardiology
has been following closely.  Her hypothermia resolved with
passive warming on admission, although she has had several
episodes of mild hypothermia off and on over her hospital stay
which has resolved with blankets and monitoring.

Neuro: Seizure activity last noted on [**4-22**], EEG performed
[**2188-4-18**] which showed global slowing without focal abnormalities
indicative of a diffuse metabolic, toxic, or infectious process.
 Was switched to Keppra on [**4-22**].  Neurological exams have been
non-focal to date, with a gradual improvement in mental status
over the course of her MICU stay. At the time of discharge, she
is awake and talking but not completely oriented and very
lethargic, but this is vast improvement over initial
assessments.  She has had an extensive head and neck workup upon
admission which has been largely negative save for evidence of
old lacunar infarcts.  Neuro has been following closely.  As her
mental status improved, it became apparent that the patient
suffered from cortical blindness with associated neglect of her
deficit; MRI exam failed to demonstrate discrete lesions
affecting her visual pathways.

Renal:	Acute renal failure with low urine output on admission
and was started on CVVH [**4-13**] and switched to hemodialysis on
[**4-17**] for which she had a tunneled RIJ catheter placed. Urine
protein to creatinine ratios since [**4-14**] have been consistently
higher than 3.0, indicative of a probable nephrotic syndrome,
but U/A microscopy showed only scant muddy-brown casts. At the
time of discharge, she had increased urine output and was
started on an oral diuretic regimen. She did not require
hemodialysis for 4-5 days prior to discharge and her creatinine
remained stable.

Endocrine: long-standing NIDDM with unknown complications, and
has required NPH and sliding scale insulin during the MICU
admission.  Hypothyroidism initially treated with levothyroxine
and IV T3, which has improved her lab values, and the IV T3 was
stopped on [**4-24**], and she has remained on the levothyroxine.
Considerable thought has been given to the idea that this
clinical picture may be one of myxedemic coma, and endocrine has
been following as well, but is not convinced this is the case.
She was also noted to have low cortisol response on admission
and was started on IV steroids, has since been tapered down and
is currently on a prednisone taper which was completed by the
time of discharge.

Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname 54741**] was markedly thrombocytopenic on admission with
platelets around 30K, but this remained somewhat stable and has
improved with platelet transfusions (3 total, most recently on
[**2188-4-23**]).  Her hematocrit on admission was low (21.7) and she
has received a total of 6 units RBCs since admission (most
recently 2 units on [**4-21**]).  The heme service was constuled and
felt that there was no evidence of ongoing hemolysis but that
her iron studies show some indication of a possible chronic
anemia unrelated to her iron levels, and a continually low
reticulocyte count. If there are any future concerns, she should
follow up with hematology.

Pulmonary: Pt was intubated on admission and remained intubated
until [**4-24**].  During that time she was initially clear on CXR but
developed bilateral layered effusions bilaterally (R>L) and a
focal  ground glass opacity in the LUL.  The effusion is thought
to be evidence of CHF, infection, or aspiration.  The patient
was started on a week course of Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and
