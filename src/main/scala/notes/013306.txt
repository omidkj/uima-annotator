CXR [**2188-2-27**]: IMPRESSION: Interval progression of airspace
disease, particularly at the left lung base concerning for
pneumonia. Superimposed air-fluid level in the left lung base
medially, potentially air within enlarged bronchus versus
cavitary pneumonia. Multiple air-fluid levels at the right lung
base suggestive of fluid within dilated bronchi as demonstrated
on previous exam.  CT scan would offer additional detail.


CT CHEST [**2188-2-28**]
1. Multifocal pneumonia as seen on chest radiographs from [**2-27**].
2. Worsening cystic bronchiectasis in both lower lobes.
Air-fluid levels at
the right base are most likely secretions. No evidence of
abscess.
3. Pneumobilia. Question whether this patient has had a recent
biliary
intervention.
4. Tracheal diverticulosis, unchanged.
5. Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

BRONCHOSCOPY [**2188-3-6**]

BAL samples obtained.
Extensive cystic disease
Foreign body noted and query of possible tracheo-oesophageal
fistula

Brief Hospital Course:
# Sepsis secondary to pneumonia with acute bronchiectasis:
Confirmed pneumonia noted on CT chest [**2188-2-28**].  CT chest also
showed progression of bronchiectasis with multiple fluid/air
levels.  Patient was continued on broad antibiotics
Vancomycin/Meropenem/Azithromycin.  Gram stain of sputum showing
 4+ g- rods, 4+ g+ rods, G+ cocci in pairs and clusters,
eventually came back as contamination with oral flora.  He was
started on aggressive broncho-pulmonary hygiene.  Steroids were
held given no evidence of bronchospasm. A more adequate sputum
sample was required and a bronchoscopy was done on [**2188-3-6**].
However, sputum came back showing oral flora suggestive of his
airways being colonized. Bronchoscopy showed cystic disease as
well as a small foreign body which was unable to be retrieved
during procedure. This raised a concern for a new
tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Interventional pulmonary team will
work him up for this when he is back from his trip next week. He
was discharged on [**2188-3-7**] to complete home IV ertapenem (14 day
course of carbopenem).  He had already a planned trip to go out
of town.  It was explained to him that it was a better idea to
stay in [**Location (un) 86**] and have home IV nurses visit but he chose to
take IV antibiotics with him in his suitcase on his trip and
administer them himself abroad ([**Location (un) 19061**] and [**Location (un) 55444**]).  IP will
follow up with him as an out-patient for further work-up

# Hyponatremia:  Given rapid response to 2L IVF, patient was
thought to be volume deplete.  His sodium remained corrected
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.

# Hypotension: Concern for septic physiology given reported
normal baseline and significant penumonia.  However, patient had
no evidence of lactic acidosis.  BP did not respond to bolus.
After speakign to the patient and reviewing the medical record,
pt's BP tends to run in the 90s to low 100s.

# Coagulopathy:  INR 1.4 which appears chronically elevated.
Could be nutritional vs component of liver dysfunction.
