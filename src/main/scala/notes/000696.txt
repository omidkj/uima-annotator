Normal sinus rhythm. Possible left atrial abnormality.

cardiopulmonary process.

CT head [**3-21**]
No definite acute intracranial process. Lytic lesions throughout

the skull compatible with multiple myeloma.

1. Ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung zones may
reflect
atelectasis, though a developing infectious process, possibly
aspiration,
cannot be excluded.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. 2.2 cm rounded hypodensity in the lower pole of left kidney
may represent hemorrhagic cyst, however cannot exclude
malignancy. No lymphadenopathy evident. Could be further
evaluated with ultrasound.
3. Extensive rounded peripancreatic calcifications of unclear
etiology may
represent combination of calcified cysts, and adjacent
