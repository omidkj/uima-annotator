History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 yo F w/ h/o COPD/emphysema, HTN, OSA, who presented
with acute worsening of dyspnea. Ms. [**Known lastname 35914**] reported dypsnea
worse than her baseline and diaphoresis, but denied productive
cough, chest pain, fevers, sick contacts, abdominal pain,
bloody/black stools. Patient is poor historian. Per EMS
documentation, patient found at home, with labored breathing,
with RR of 39 and O2 sat of 97%. In the ED she had a Tmax of
99.6, RR 26-36, O2 sat in mid-90s on nebulizer. With persistent
dyspnea she was started on non-invasive ventilation in the ED.
She received solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, ceftriaxone 1g IV, and
azithromycin 500 gm PO.
.
At home, Ms. [**Known lastname 35914**] uses home oxygen (uncertain of amount) and
Bi-PAP.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 35914**] was admitted for a COPD exacerbation on [**3-8**],
thought to be secondary to non-compliance with home O2 and
possible URI.
.
Given severity of dyspnea, minimal improvement with nebulizer
treatments, she was admitted to the ICU for non-invasive
ventilation and frequent nebulizer treatments.
.
In the MICU, she was initially placed on non-invasive
ventilation. But due to increased work of breathing, rising
PCO2, and increased acidosis she was intubated on night of
admission.
.
She was extubated on [**2199-4-21**]. she did well over the last 24
hours. she was continued on CTX and azithro for pnumonia. her
steroids were changed to PO. when I saw her, she was sitting in
a chair. pt denies any trouble breathing. however she says that
she has not yet walked and hence cant really tell if her
breathing is at baseline. she denies any CP, paslpitations,
dizziness, N/V/D/pain in [**Last Name (un) 103**]. her appetite is good. had a BM
today. pulled foley today and is yet to void.
