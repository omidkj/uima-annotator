History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 51-year-old M with PMHx obesity, HLD, HTN who
presented to PMD today ([**6-19**]) with 2-3 days of malaise, SOB, and
epigastric bloating. Over the past 2 weeks he could not lie flat
and occasionally had PND. He also noted intermittant fever and
chills with myalgias with an intermittent dry cough while lying
flat. No recent travel or sick contacts. The patient denies
having any chest pain, including no CP on exertion. No dizziness
or palpitations.

On entrance into Urgent Care today, initial oxygen saturation
was 86%. With 6 L nasal cannula, increased to 90% with some
improvement in
symptoms.

The patient reports that he had recently been lost to follow up
because he lost his job and also his health insurance. During
this time ([**2150-10-20**]-[**2151-3-21**]) he was very depressed and began
drinking heavily. The patient would finish a full bottle of
Vodka every 2-3 days. He stopped after convincing from his
daughter and subsequently found a new job last month.

He reports that while he had no health insurance, he was not
able to take some of his BP medications.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He does have
SOB on exertion and orthopnea.

ECG [**6-19**]
Possible atrial ectopic rhythm given unusual axis of P wave.
Possible old
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Possible old inferior
myocardial
infarction. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.

TTE [**6-21**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and
anterior walls. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (mid LAD distribution; cannot exclude Takosubo
cardiomyopathy if clinically cuggested).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-6-20**], the
findings are similar.

Caridac Cath- [**6-22**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA was
free of any angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
The LAD
had a large 90% lesion proximally.  There was a 100% occlusion
in the
large D1.  The LCx also had a 90% stenosis proximally in the
large ramus
intermedius branch.  The large OM2 had an 80% stenosis.  The RCA
had a
100% occlusion in the mid-vessel.  The distal vessel filled via
well-established left-to-right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
systolic
arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 124/84,
mean 98
mmHg.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 year old male presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-19**] from urgent care with 3
days worsening shortness of breath and fatigue. He was found to
be in systolic heart failure. Cardiac cath revelaed severe 3
vessel disease and patient is scheduled for CABG procedure [**6-29**].

Systolic CHF
Patient presented with decompensated CHF and severe pulmonary
edema, requiring intermittent BiPAP on admission. After several
days of aggressive IV diuresis, the patient no longer needed any
O2 therapy to maintain normal sats. His medication regimen for
heart failure was optimized: now on 40mg Lisinopril daily, 12.5
Carvedilol [**Hospital1 **], and Furosemide 40mg Daily. Spirionolactone may
be started as an
outpatient.

3 Vessel Coronary Artery Disease
Cardiac Cath [**6-22**] revealed:
The LAD had a large 90% lesion proximally.  There was a 100%
occlusion in the
large D1.  The LCx also had a 90% stenosis proximally in the
large ramus
intermedius branch.  The large OM2 had an 80% stenosis.  The RCA
had a
100% occlusion in the mid-vessel.  The distal vessel filled via
well-established left-to-right collaterals.
The patient was maintained on ASA 81mg.
The patient is scheduled for CABG [**6-29**].
Based on ECG findings and patient's history, he likely had a
silent, large anterior MI approximately 4-6 weeks prior to
presenting to urgent care center.
The patient's CAD was medically managed before CABG procedure
with Aspirin and Atorvastatin.  He was chest pain free and did
not experience shortness of breath leading up to his surgery.

The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2151-6-29**] where
the patient underwent Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x5;
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
and saphenous vein graft to diagonal, and saphenous vein
sequential graft to ramus and obtuse marginal, and saphenous
vein graft to posterior left ventricular branch and Endoscopy
harvesting of the long saphenous vein.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   POD 1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact. He required
milrinone for hemodynamic support until POD#2.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.
