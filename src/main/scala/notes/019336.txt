does not know much about this course, and is unsure of
antibiotics use. She did develop a rash while she was there,
which has continued, but not gotten worse. Per her daughter, it
sounds like she may also have been transfused while in the ICU
there.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2124-4-17**]:
AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
are within
normal limits. Streaky opacities are seen in both lung apices,
with
associated right apical pleural thickening are unchanged and may
relate to
mild chronic fibrotic changes. There is minimal bibasilar
atelectasis without focal consolidation. Stable blunting of
right costophrenic angle is noted.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
