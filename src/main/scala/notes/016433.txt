Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
code stroke: aphasia, right facial droop, right hemiparesis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trach, PEG, HD, TEE


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 yo man with DM II x 15 yrs, ESRD on
dialysis, HTN, hyperlipidemia, smoker, who presents with acute
onset aphasia, R facial droop and R hemiparesis, last seen nml
by
his wife at 22h30. [**Name2 (NI) **] was brought to [**Hospital 48159**] Hospital where he
was assessed around 23h30. He had a NCHCT that did not reveal
intracranial bleed. Given that his R hemiparesis had almost
fully
resolved, the ED physician was of the opinion that his deficits
were improving and elected not to administer ivTPA on that
basis,
though the patient remained mute and had no contraindication on
the screening form they filled out. He received 0.5 mg Ativan at
2 am prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and upon arrival a stroke
code
was called at 3h15 am. I arrived 5 mins later and we planned for
a CT perfusion as well as CTA. Given his renal failure, the
dialysis fellow was called prior to administering iv contrast
which accounted for some of the delay, such that the CT scan was
performed at 4 am and completed at 4h30. His last dialysis was
Fri [**1-27**], a few hours prior to presentation. CXR: no
consolidation. EKG nsr, LAD, primary AVB, IVCD, peaked T waves,
NSST changes. U/a neg for leuks or nitrites, protein > 300
mg/dL.
INR 0.96. K 4.8, gluc 200-300.

CTA/CTP HEAD/NECK:
CONCLUSION: Extensive elevation of the mean transit time
throughout the left middle cerebral artery territory. The blood
volume in this location is mostly preserved, indicating that
this is potentially a reversible defect. However, the
non-contrast CT scan suggests low density and swelling in the
left MCA territory, which would imply a completed infarct.

The CT angiogram demonstrates occlusion of the left vertebral
artery in its cervical course. However, the carotid arteries and
their intracranial branches appear patent.
.
MRI HEAD:
FINDINGS: The MR findings are similar to those displayed on the
prior CT scan. There is evidence of acute infarction in the
distribution of the superior division of the left middle
cerebral artery. This demonstrates marked hyperintensity on the
diffusion-weighted images, and corresponding hypointensity on
the apparent diffusion coefficient map. The MRA examination
demonstrates an abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the
left MCA with a faint tapering that suggests a meniscus and a
likely intraluminal filling defect. These findings are most
suggestive of an embolic infarction in this location with a tiny
trickle of flow passing distal to the occlusion. The distal left
vertebral artery appears tiny and the right vertebral artery
appears dominant. This is a normal variant. No other
intracranial vascular abnormalities are noted.

CONCLUSION: Acute infarction in the superior division of the
left middle cerebral artery with near occlusion of this branch
just distal to the middle cerebral artery bifurcation. There is
no evidence of hemorrhage.
.
CXR In comparison with the study of [**2-11**], allowing for
differences in
position of the patient, there is little overall change.  Tubes
remain in
place.  Patchy area of opacification persists at the left base,
which could well represent atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot
be excluded.
.
TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. There are
complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the ascending aorta,
aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta to 37cm beyond the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2) by planimetry. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is moderate valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2) related to the severe MAC (no
evidence of rheumatic deformity). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The intra-atrial septum and right atrium were not well
seen. Agitated saline was injected at rest with no appearance of
bubbles in the left atrium suggestive of the absence of a PFO or
ASD with right to left shunting. Left ventircular function is
probably normal based on limited views.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old man with a history of DM2, ESRD on
HD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented with aphasia and right
face/arm/leg weakness, found to have a L MCA stroke from likely
embolic source, transfered to ICU for possible PNA management
and subsequent trach/peg on [**2-6**].

#. Neuro: STROKE. He was found to have a L MCA superior division
stroke. He was not a candidate for thrombolysis as he was more
than 6 hours past his last known well time when Neurology was
consulted at [**Hospital1 18**]. Patient was initially evaluated at OSH
within the tPA windonw, however none was given as it was felt
that his symptoms were improving.  Etiology was thought to be
intracranial thromboembolism secondary to multiple risk factors.
He was started on aspirin, which is sufficient anti-platelet
therapy as he was not on prior such agents. CT Angiogram showed
patent carotids but chronically occluded left vertebral artery.
TTE and TEE showed no ASD, PFO, or cardioembolic source. Hb A1c
was found to be 8.2; covered with an ISS, though he may need
adjustment of his diabetes regimen as an outpatient after his
acute illness. LDL was 113, HDL 39, Tot chol 184, and Trig 160;
he was started on Lipitor. However, lipitor was stopped due to
marked elevation of CKs to 1000s.  Patient also had a repeat
head CT on [**2-9**] that showed slight progression of his affected L
MCA teritory.  They
