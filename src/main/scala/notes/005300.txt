Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
82f with HTN, DM2, cva from bleeding aneurysm x 2 s/p clipping,
COPD on 2L home o2, and a recent admit at [**Hospital1 112**] for what sounds
like urosepsis presented to the ED with bloating and dyspnea.
After her admit, she's been at [**Hospital1 599**] NH, where for the past few
days she's had worsening dyspnea and has felt bloated.  Her
daughter is concerned they weren't keeping up with her
medication regimen, and this is why she became overloaded.
.
In the ED, she required 4L to keep o2 in mid-90's.  She was felt
to be significantly overloaded, with plans to admit to the
medical floor for diuresis, but while in the ED, she became
increasingly lethargic, demonstrated poor respiratory effort;
ABG returned 7.13/151, and she was intubated.  There was
question of post-intubation seizure activity, but her daughter
(who was with her for the majority of the time and is intimately
familiar with her health history) does not feel that she had a
seizure.
.
She's had some intermittent fevers since her admit to [**Hospital1 112**].
Cough and phlegm for about two weeks.  No other major sx,
without c/s, chest pain, abd pain, n/v/d/c, dysuria, hematuria,
rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 woman with AS, htn, dm2, diastolic chf, cva x 2, seizure d/o,
severe copd here with hypercarbic resp failure in setting of
volume overload.  Hosp course by problem:
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient is with known COPD
and chronically elevated bicarb suggestive of CO2 retention,
however acute precipitant of decompensation in the ED not
entirely clear (preintubation gas 7.13/151/53).  CXR revealed
volume overload. Sounds as if has been progressively overloaded
and this may have been primary insult, though atypical for
overload to cause a primary hypercarbia.  Perhaps overload
caused increased work of breathing and she tired.  She was
intubated in the ED and treated in the MICU.  Treatment included
abx for PNA, steroids and nebs for COPD, and lasix gtt for dCHF
exacerbation.  See below for details.  Respiratory status
improved with treatment of COPD exacerbation, fluid overload and
MRSA pneumonia.  She was extubated on [**5-31**] without issue and
transferred to floor in stable condition on [**6-1**].
.
# MRSA pneumonia: Growing MRSA from sputum culture. Treated with
8 day course  of vancomycin.  This was completed prior to
discharge.  No infiltrate grew on CXR so not entirely clear that
this was primary issue.
.
# COPD exacerbation. Chronic C02 retention. Baseline CO2 around
80. Treated with prednisone taper, nebs, home inhalers with
improvement. On room air at time of discharge.  Please continue
atrovent, albuterol, and steroid taper as per med list.
.
# Congestive heart failure: Diastolic etiology. Treated with
lasix gtt followed by boluses for preload reduction. Discharged
on lasix 20mg PO daily. ON ACE-I for afterload reduction and
betablocker. Euvolemic at time of d/c.  Please recheck lytes in
[**2-15**] days and adjust ACE-i and lasix as needed.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW. Baseline low 30's at [**Hospital1 112**].
Stable but profoundly below baseline. Brown, guaiac + stools.
EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] [**2114**] at [**Hospital1 112**] showed non-errosive gastritis with negative
antral biopsy, colonic polyp: hyperplastic adenoma. Treated with
IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] initially. HCT nadir at 20 so received 1u in MICU.
HCT stable therafter.  We gave an additional 2u on day prior to
discharge and her hct was 31. Switched to PO PPI daily, iron
supplements and will likely need outpatient colonoscopy.
Consider repeat HCT in [**2-15**] days to ensure stability.
.
# Decreased mental status: In part hypercarbia and in part
phenoytoin load and lorazepam in ED. Improving with decreased
sedating meds. Likely component of delirium as well given
infection and hospital stay.  Delirium improved and patient was
without sitter for >24h prior to d/c.
.
# ? seizure activity: Possible seizure after intubation.
Unclear if actually was a seizure. She has some seizure history
per [**Hospital1 112**] records but unclear details, may have been placed on
phenytoin for prophylaxis given prior intracerebral hemorrhage.
Level on arrival low but s/p load in ED. No clear seizure
activity during her stay. Treated with phenytoin per home dose.
.
# UTI: ESBL E. coli. Initially treated with bactrim but ESBL.
Patient's foley removed and repeat UA/urine culture checked.
Pending upon discharge.  Completed 3 day course of bactrim.  Not
clear that she had a UTI.  Instead may just be colonized with
ESBL.
.
# Lung nodule: Per [**2119-5-29**] CXR read: "Left mid lung nodule,
which remains indeterminate, however, may contain calcified
component. Repeat chest radiograph recommended in three months
for further evaluation."
- will need repeat imaging to follow as outpatient.
.
# Diabetes melitus, type 2: BG moderately controlled with RISS,
uses NPH at home: 6u qam, 12u qpm; Started back on home reigmen
adn couvered with sliding scale.
.
# Hypernatremia: Improved with 500cc D5W. Sodium subsequently
normalized.
.
# Access: PICC placed and remained at discharge.  Since abx
finished, we pulled PICC prior to transport.
.
# Full code.
