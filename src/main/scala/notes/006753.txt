Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83 yo male with history of CAD, DM with significant neuropathy,
HTN, CHF with EF 40-45% in [**2176**] presenting with acute dyspnea.
The patient was in his usual state of health until he started
feeling fatigued on the day prior to admission on [**2183-1-23**]. Of
note, he says he stopped taking his lasix 1 month ago because he
was told by his PCP to do so, however, PCP's letter does not
support this. He also reports some sodium indiscretions
including occasional bacon and corned hash. Last night, he was
awoken by the sensation of sudden severe dyspnea and tachypnea.
He took oxazepam which gave him no relief and he promptly called
EMS. Per EMS report, he was saturating in the 60s on room air
and was given supplemental O2 and lasix 40mg IV ONCE.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.7 110 152/96 30 85% RA (as low as
79% on RA). He was still hypoxic and tachypneic in the ED, and
was therefore given another 40mg of lasix IV in the ED and was
initiated on bipap. His saturations improved to 100% and he
became more comfortable and less tachypneic. After 30 minutes,
however, he became hypotensive to the 80s/50s and thereore bipap
was discontinued. A nitro gtt was ordered but never given
secondary to hypotension. His saturations and tachypnea improved
however but he still remained on 4LNC as he was found to be 89%
on RA. He refused a foley therefore it was difficult to discern
how much urine output response he had. His last set of vitals
were 97.4 102 137/88 18 94%4LNC.
.
Of note, he had a recent hospitalization for acute heart failure
and new onset atrial fibrillation at [**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesly ICU [**11-22**].
He was incidentally noted to have left 5th and 6th rib fractures
on CXR secondary to recent fall. He was given labetolol for RVR
rate control but became hypotensive and given dopamine. His RVR
worsened and was switched to neosynephrine. His troponins peaked
to 1.97 but were thought to be [**1-15**] demand. He was diuresed with
lasix and called out to the regular floor with continued
improvement. He was not anticoaggulated [**1-15**] frequent falls, but
started on ASA 325 daily and discharged to rehab. He continues
to see PT.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he denied complaints but felt cold.
.

8. New onset a fib [**11-22**] not on coumadin [**1-15**] falls.

Social History:
Lives with his wife, still drives, walks with cane when he is
out and a walker in his home. Has had about [**2-14**] mechanical falls
per month over the past few months and this is concerning for
him. He has been worried about having to need help at home or
having to move to [**Hospital3 **] although he adamantly refuses
to go to rehab. Drinks 3-4 high balls per day, former smoker, no
drug use. Former OB/GYN, retired in late [**2151**]'s. Wife was a gyn
pathologist.

CXR [**1-24**]
FINDINGS: Compared to the film from earlier the same day, there
continues to be moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular
redistribution and hazy alveolar infiltrate. Left posterior rib
fractures are again visualized.
IMPRESSION: CHF, similar in appearance compared to the film from
earlier the same day.

EKG [**1-24**]
Narrow complex regular supraventricular tachycardia. Possible
prior inferior myocardial infarction. Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes. Cannot exclude
myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-1-23**]
irregular supraventricular tachycardia is present. ST-T wave
changes are more pronounced and possibly rate-related.

TTE [**1-23**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
all distal segments and the apex. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 30-45 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is mild to moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and mildly reduced overall left ventricular
systolic function with regional wall motion abnormalities as
described above. Elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis. No clinically signficant
valvular regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic
pressures.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2177-2-17**], mild to moderate aortic stenosis is
new. The overall left ventricular systolic function is similar
although additional new wall motion abnormalities cannot be
excluded given suboptimal image quality.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo male with history of CAD, DM with significant neuropathy,
HTN, CHF with EF 40-45% in [**2176**] who presented to the ED on
[**2183-1-23**] with acute dyspnea in the setting of recent
discontinuation of lasix and dietary indiscretions.

#) Dyspnea: Most likely secondary to acute on chronic systolic
congestive heart failure secondary to 1 month of lasix
nonadherance from a misunderstanding of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10700**]. Als
