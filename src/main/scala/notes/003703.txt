obstruction, with transition point at the level of the ileocecal
valve.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2146-1-22**] 3:48 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Complete small-bowel obstruction, with transition point at
the level of the ileocecal valve. Taking into account the recent
hernia reduction, it is unclear whether these findings could
represent slow passage of fecalized small bowel contents into
the cecum following the hernia reduction.
2. No sign of incarcerated hernia. Fluid-filled hernia sac seen
in the right inguinal region. This may be related to recent
reduction of the inguinal hernia.
3. Right lower lobe atelectasis, and a few nodular areas of
right lower lobe opacity which could represent aspiration, less
likely an infectious process.
4. Extensive thoracolumbar spine degenerative change, and
multiple vertebral body compression fractures as described
above.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2146-1-22**]  2:43:36 PM
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Extensive
ST-T wave
changes which are likely due to rate or myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2145-12-22**] the rate has increased
significantly and there are
now diffuse ST-T wave changes. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2146-1-30**] 4:15 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman s/p LOA for obstruction w/ elevated WBC
COMPARISON: [**2146-1-26**].
FINDINGS: The NGT, left CVL and ETT have been removed. Large
retrocardiac density with air-fluid level was consistent with
hiatal hernia. Adjacent atelectasis is seen. There are no new
focal consolidations and the pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] markings appear
normal. There is stable cardiomegaly.
IMPRESSION: No new consolidations.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old female with 1 1/2 days of abdominal pain,
right groin pain, and
N/V. EMS was called for respiratory distress and she was
intubated in the ED. She had peritoneal signs on exam and a SBO
was found on CT and the pt went to the OR for ex-lap + LOA.

CV: She received beta blockers when appropriate for rate
control. She continued in A-fib. When appropriate, her Coumadin
was restarted.
Her cardiologist recommended IV Lasix for 24-48 hours to assist
with diuresis and then to resume her home PO dose. She responded
well to the IV Lasix.

Resp: She was intubated and comfortable. As she improved
clinically, she was weaned to extubate. She was extubated on
[**2146-1-26**]. She had CXR at time of discharge to assess volume
status and she was not fluid overloaded.

Abd/GI: She was NPO with IVF and a NGT. She had a Dobhoff
placed, but it remained in the stomach. She was started on
trophic tubefeeds. She was seen by speech and swallow and
cleared for a PO diet. Her NGT was removed, Dobhoff removed, and
her diet was advanced along.
Her incision was C/D/I, with a small amount of redness along the
incision.

Renal: Her BUN/Cr were monitored and stable. She had good urine
output and her volume status was watched closely. She received
occasional fluid bolus for hypovolemia. As she continued to
improved, she was started back on Lasix for diuresis due to her
CHF.

ID: She was started on broad coverage ABX, including Vanco,
Zosyn, and Flagyl. Her antibiotics were tailored and she grew
E.coli from her urine and completed a 7 day course of Meropenum.

The patient's daughter was concerned about recurrent [**Name (NI) 14870**] and
was requesting prophylactic ABX.

Atrial Fibrillation: She continued in A-fib with a controlled
rate. She was started back on her Coumadin.

PT: It was recommended that she be discharged to a rehab
facility for further strength and stability training.
