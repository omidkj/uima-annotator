History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10602**] is an 89 yo male with prostate cancer who presents
with a right ankle fracture sustained during a mechanical fall
yesterday. He states that he was bending over in the bathroom to
pick up something from the floor and fell onto his right side.
He denies hitting his head or loss of consciousness. He
initially refused transport to the hospital but was then
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] this morning after noting that
his ankle was more swollen with worsening pain. He states that
he was unable to ambulate. On arrival at [**Hospital3 **], he was
diagnosed with a bimalleolar fracture of the right ankle. His
labs at [**Hospital3 **] were significant only for troponinI of
0.07. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation.

on RA. At the time of this interview he reports pain is 4 out of
10 in severity and he complains only of hunger. He states that
he ambulates at baseline with a walker and can walk for 30
minutes in duration with his walker and routinely walks in the
corridor of the apartment building where he lives. He reports
occasional falls and states that his wife has always been able
to help him up. He has never had any chest pain and denies any
shortness of breath, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black

Knee/Ankle X-ray [**2159-1-20**]:
Limited examination secondary to overlying cast material.
Bimalleolar fractures involving the right ankle as described.
Overall, the alignment appears near anatomic. If further
assessment of fracture extent is required, a CT of the ankle is
advised. Unremarkable right knee.

Abdominal x-ray [**2159-1-23**]:
Dilated loops of colon, with air also seen in the rectum, which
can be seen in an early obstruction or pseudo-obstruction.

CT abd/pelvis [**2159-1-25**]:
1. Extensive emphysema within the gastric wall, with foci of
free air along the GE junction and medial aspect of the stomach.
Given the patient's reported lack of acute abdominal findings or
risk factors for infarction or signs of infection, these
findings are likely due to traumatic dissection by repeated NG
tube placement or intramural dissection of air from massive
gastric distention as seen on prior abdominal radiograph from
[**2159-1-24**]. These findings were discussed urgently with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5320**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73438**] at 6:30 p.m. on [**2159-1-25**].
2. Decreased colonic distention without evidence of obstruction,
likely resolving ileus.
3. Non-obstructive 5-mm left renal calculus and additional tiny
left renal stones vs. excreted (previously administered)
contrast.
4. Small left and tiny right pleural effusions.
5. Incompletely evaluated lesions of the left kidney, for which
ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.

CT abd [**2159-1-27**]:
1. Interval decrease in the gastroesophageal pneumatosis and
tiny pneumomediastinum.
2. Stable small left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
3. Small cystic-appearing lesion in the uncinate process of the
pancreas. This could represent a side-branch IPMN or sequela of
prior pancreatitis. Further evaluation with MRCP would be
helpful when the clinical situation permits.
4. Stable severe L2 compression fracture.
5. Tiny volume ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10602**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-1-20**] via transfer from
[**Hospital3 **] Medical Center with a right ankle fracture.  He
was evaluated, prepped, consented, and cleared for surgery by
medicine.  On [**2158-1-20**] he was taken to the operating room and
underwent an ORIF of his right ankle.  He tolerated the
procedure well, was extubated, transferred to the recovery room,
and then to the floor.  On the floor he was seen by physical
therapy to improve his strength and mobility.

On [**2159-1-23**], a KUB film showed dilated bowel 11.5 cm, stool in
rectum, and he was given mag citrate. The following day, a KUB
obtained after the patient vomited showed very large gastric
bubble with no definite ileus. An NG tube was placed with a
large amount of fluid draining. His WBC increased to 20 (up from
13) though the patient remained afebrile. Cipro IV was started
while the patient was NPO. On [**2159-1-25**], his NGT put out 600cc
brown flacky out-put within 3 hrs. The patient appeared to
improve and WBC went down to 19.5 from 23. Again, he remained
afebrile, with stable VS, soft abdomen, and decreased
distention.

A subsequent abdominal CT showed emphysema within the gastric
wall, Heme Occult +, Gastric Occult +, and IV Protonix was
started. The CT findings may be related to extensive gastric
distention from recent ileus, or traumatic dissection from NG
tube, with focal perforation.

A General Surgery Assessment concluded it was a contained
perforation. The NGT was continued and broad spectrum
antibiotics were started (Vanc, Cipro, Flagyl, Fluconazole). GI
was consulted and felt an EGD would be contraindicated.
After after stay in the ICU for precautionary reasons, a repeat
CT scan showed resolving emphysema. The patient did receive two
days of TPN in the interim. This was discontinued as the patient
began to tolerate PO intake. He was started on Vitamin D and
calcium supplement. He was restarted on Lovenox for an
additional two weeks post-discharge and is to remain non-weight
bearing on his right lower extremity until further follow up in
ortho clinic in two weeks.
