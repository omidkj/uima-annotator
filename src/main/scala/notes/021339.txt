HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with
lethargy and a change in mental status for the last four to
five days.  The patient was noted by his family to be more
sleepy than usual for the last four to five days prior to
admission.  He had a sore throat and a cough.  He took two
days of antibiotics.  He became dehydrated and vomited.  He
has had similar episodes of lethargy eight years and ten
years ago.  He was thought to have transient ischemic attack.
He was brought into a neurologist at [**Location (un) 1121**] the day
before yesterday, who thought that this was not a transient
ischemic attack.

The patient was reported to be just sleepy.  He was oriented
times three.  No complaints.  No headache.  No abdominal
pain.  Weight loss was denied for the last six months.  No
fractures.

In the Emergency Department he was found to have a calcium
of 14.9 with a free ionized calcium of 1.87.  He was given 3
liters of normal saline as well as one dose of Lasix in the
Emergency Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2168**].
2.  Biopsy of a liver mass earlier this year showed only
cirrhosis.  No malignancy.
3.  Congestive heart failure, was admitted for congestive
heart failure with pulmonary edema as well recently.
4.  Has a history of peripheral vascular disease, no
amputations.
5.  His last PSA was normal.  He has benign prostatic
hypertrophy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer in daughter.  [**Name (NI) 3730**] in son as
well.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Quit smoking on recent admission.  Has a
plus 60-pack-year history.  No alcohol.  Lives at home
independently with his wife.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a blood pressure
of 189/79, 197/86; repeated 141/51, 130/148 after receiving
his medications.  Afebrile.  Pulse in the 50s.
Respirations 20.  HEENT examination revealed normocephalic
and atraumatic.  Oropharynx was dry.  No jugular venous
distention.  Cardiac revealed S1/S2, bradycardic.  No
murmurs.  Lungs revealed crackles in the left lung.  Abdomen
revealed bowel sounds positive, soft and nontender.  Liver
edge was palpable.  Extremities had no edema.  No palpable
pulses, warm and well perfused.  Spoke Russian only.
Appeared alert and oriented.

LABORATORY RESULTS:  Significant for a calcium of 14.9
and 14.6, phosphate of 3.9, magnesium of 2.1, ammonia 25.
White blood cell count was 6.7, hematocrit 38.  Chem-7
revealed a sodium of 137, potassium 5, chloride 106,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 42, creatinine 1.7, glucose 126.  Urine
toxicology screen aspirin, alcohol, benzodiazepines,
barbiturates, and tricyclics were all negative.  Urinalysis
revealed yellow/clear, clean for infection.  Free calcium
was 1.87.  ALT 47, AST 46, LD 137, alkaline phosphatase 108,
amylase 131, lipase 30.  Creatine kinase 48.  Total bilirubin
of 0.4.

A head CT was done in the Emergency Department which was
negative for acute bleed or mass.

Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm, Q-T was 390, QTc
was 400.  A new T wave inversions in lead II; otherwise, no
change in ST-T wave segments.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service.  He was given intravenous fluids as well as Lasix
for his hypercalcemia without change in calcium levels over
the first two days.  In addition, on admission, he was given
a pamidronate infusion 90 mg, and over the next two days his
calcium normalized.

Workup included a parathyroid hormone which was elevated
at 299.  Before that came back, however, he was sent for a
bone scan which showed no lesions.  A CT scan was planned of
his abdomen and chest; however, that was not obtained since
it appeared that he had primary hyperparathyroidism.

An Endocrine consultation was called and they recommended
following his calcium daily.  In addition, for the primary
parathyroid, they wanted as sestamibi scan of the parathyroid
for localization, and then they wanted a Surgery consultation
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for timing of removal of his parathyroid.
At the time of discharge, the patient's calcium was stable
and normal.


CARDIOLOGY:  The patient had a ventricular fibrillation
arrest on [**2192-5-10**], on the floor.  He was noted to be
unresponsive and pulseless.  A code was called, and a quick
look demonstrated torsades.  He was given intravenous
magnesium, shocked at 300 joules, developed a wide complex
escape rhythm, and then ventricular fibrillation, and shocked
again, developing a wide complex tachycardia at 140.  Shocked
an additional three times, resulting in a narrow complex
tachycardia; later had a Wenckebach.

The patient was intubated and transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit where he was stabilized.  His creatine kinases in
the unit peaked in the 400s and then trended down.  The
patient was extubated the following day without any
difficulty.

An echocardiogram was obtained.  Echocardiogram showed left
atrium elongation, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, left ventricular cavity size was normal,
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
right ventricular chamber size was normal.  Mitral valve
leaflets were mildly thickened, mild annular calcification,
mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation was seen, moderate
tricuspid regurgitation was seen.  No pericardial effusion.
Aortic root was normal.  Aspirin and beta blocker was
continued.  The patient was on intravenous heparin during his
admission.  It was discontinued on his transfer to the floor.
His beta blocker was discontinued because the patient had a
pause on telemetry.  Captopril was used for his blood
pressure control and increased as needed for good control.
It was later changed to lisinopril for convenience of dosing.

The patient had atrial fibrillation after transfer from the
Coronary Care Unit to the floor.  Rate was in the 70s without
any beta blockade.  The patient spontaneously converted to
normal sinus rhythm.  Question of starting amiodarone on this
patient.

CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  The patient's mental status had not
improved.  He was lethargic on admission and that was
attributed to her hypercalcemia.  After ventricular
fibrillation arrest and extubation, the patient was
somnolent, gradually improving; however, still did not
recognize family.  He was conversant and spoke in full
sentences.  He did become agitated.  He was being medicated
with Ativan for agitation rather than Haldol because of his
torsade on ventricular fibrillation arrest.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had blood cultures drawn in
the Coronary Care Unit which seemed to have carinii bacterium
species diphtheroids in his blood on [**5-10**] from cultures
drawn from two different sites.  The decision was made to
treat this since the patient had a central line in and a
low-grade temperature, and the patient was started on
intravenous vancomycin 500 mg q.18h., renally dosed, for a
total of seven days.  In addition, the patient was seen to
have a urinary tract infection.  The final was Proteus
mirabilis.  The patient was on intravenous
ciprofloxacin 250 mg b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hyperparathyroidism.
2.  Hypercalcemia.
3.  Status post ventricular fibrillation arrest.
4.  Delta multiple sclerosis.
5.  Urinary tract infection.
6.  Carinii bacteremia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lisinopril 15 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Ciprofloxacin 250 mg intravenously q.12h. (last dose on
[**5-20**]).
3.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
4.  Vancomycin 500 mg intravenously q.18h. (last dose on
[**5-19**]).
5.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable for rehabilitation.

FOLLOWUP:  Follow up with General Surgery for removal of his
parathyroid glands.
