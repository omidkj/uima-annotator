Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior ST elevation myocardial
infarction, status post thrombolytic treatment.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old man with a
known history of coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction times three in the past eleven years,
who was in his usual state of health until midnight prior to
admission when he woke up from sleep due seven to eight out
of ten substernal chest pain.  It was a heavy sensation
associated with shortness of breath very similar to his prior
myocardial infarction.  He drove himself to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital
Emergency Department.  Upon arrival to the Emergency
Department, he had persistent chest pain with heart rate of
87, blood pressure 185/117 and oxygen saturation 97% on two
liters.  However, he then went into ventricular tachycardia
and ventricular fibrillation arrest for which he received 360
joule shock for five times and he was brought back to sinus
rhythm.  His electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in leads
II, III, aVF, V5 to V6 and ST depression in aVL and V1 to V3.
His initial CK was 71.  Given sublingual Nitroglycerin,
Aspirin and Lopressor.  He was loaded on Amiodarone and
started on Nitroglycerin drip, Heparin drip.  However, he had
persistent chest pain after thrombolytic treatment.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty but due to his
body size, catheterization via groin site could not be
performed.  Finally, a catheterization via the right radial
side was performed but it was only able to visualize the
right coronary arteries. The right coronary arteries showed
diffuse disease, but had no flow limiting lesions. Therefore,
no interventions had been performed.  The patient was
transferred to CCU for further monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2160**], status post Streptokinase, non Q wave
myocardial infarction in [**2167**], inferior myocardial infarction
in [**2168**], status post TPA.
2.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Morbid obesity, height five foot six inches, weight
greater than 400 pounds.
5.  Sleep apnea.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of myocardial infarction

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking in [**2160**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Norvasc 5 mg once daily.
2.  Insulin 70 units, 75/25 twice a day.
3.  Lipitor 80 mg once daily.
4.  Lasix 40 mg twice a day.
5.  Lotensin.
6.  Toprol XL 25 mg once daily.
7.  Glucophage one gram twice a day.
8.  Actos 45 mg twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to CCU, temperature was
97.1, heart rate 62, blood pressure 129/55, respiratory rate
13, oxygen saturation 96% on five liters.  Generally, the
patient is comfortable in bed in no acute distress. Head and
neck examination - no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular - normal S1 and S2, no murmur, rubs or gallops
appreciated.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Chest
- skin markings due to shock, tender at costal margins with
palpation. The abdomen is obese, soft, nondistended,
nontender.  Extremities are cool to touch, bilateral chronic
venous stasis skin changes.  Neurologically, the patient is
awake, alert and oriented, nonfocal examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  At [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, chem7 revealed sodium
133, potassium 3.7, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, blood urea
nitrogen 20, creatinine 0.7, glucose 429.  White blood cell
count 11.3, hematocrit 49.0, platelet count 338,000.  CK 71.

Laboratories on admission at [**Hospital1 188**] included white blood cell count 13.0, hematocrit 40.1,
platelet count 353,000.  Chem7 revealed sodium 132, potassium
6.0, repeat potassium 3.6, chloride 98, bicarbonate 19, blood
urea nitrogen 21, creatinine 0.7, glucose 469.  Calcium 9.0,
phosphorus 4.3, magnesium 2.0.  CK 2195, CK MB 262, MB index
11.9.  Albumin 3.6, total bilirubin 0.5, ALT 71, AST 257,
alkaline phosphatase 69.  Prothrombin time 14.4, partial
thromboplastin time 71.6, INR 1.4.  Triglycerides 262, HDL
33.  Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.33, pCO2 49, pO2 262
at 15 liters oxygen supplement.  Urinalysis negative.  Urine
culture negative. On the day of discharge, negative nitrites,
small amount of leukocyte esterase. Urine culture pending.

On [**2172-9-6**], coronary angiogram demonstrated right dominant
system. Given the patient's morbid obesity and the presence
of thrombolytic drugs, transradial approach was chosen.
However, the innominate was extremely tortuous making
catheter manipulation extremely difficult. The right coronary
artery could not be selectively engaged with a variety of
catheters.  Attempts to access the RFA were unsuccessful.
While the pulse could be localized with a Doppler needle, the
needle did not reach the artery.  The right coronary artery
system was successfully engaged and demonstrated a long 50%
stenosis in the midvessel with normal flow.  Limited resting
hemodynamics demonstrated aortic blood pressure of 133/73
with a mean of 102 at a heart rate of 59.  An elevated left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 mmHg.  Left
ventriculogram was not performed.

Catheterization [**2172-9-8**], two vessel coronary artery disease,
reduced systolic function, successful percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty stenting of the proximal
circumflex.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated
severely elevated left sided filling pressures.  Selective
coronary angiograph of the left dominant system demonstrated
two vessel disease.  The left main had mild disease.  The
left anterior descending had a focal 60% proximal stenosis.
The circumflex had an 80% proximal lesion.  OM2 and OM3 were
totally occluded.  Successful percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty/stenting of the left proximal circumflex
was performed using a 3.5 times 12.0 millimeter express two.
There was 10% residual stenosis and no apparent dissection.
No reflow was treated with aggressive vasodilators. The
thrombus in the OM2 was treated with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty using a 3.5 times 20.0
millimeter.  Final angiograph demonstrated normal flow into
OM1 and AV groove circumflex with timi 2 fast flow in OM2 and
OM3.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated impaired systolic
function with ejection fraction of 40%.  There was severe
inferior, lateral, posterior basal hypokinesis.

Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2172-9-7**], was a suboptimal
study.  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function  and wall motion cannot be reliably
assessed.  The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  No
pericardial effusion.

Chest x-ray [**2172-9-9**], limited examination secondary to
patient body habitus.  The heart is enlarged.  Mild upper
dome redistribution and blurring of the vascular detail at
the base consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
There may be a small left pleural effusion.  The lungs
otherwise appear clear.  No rib fractures are identified.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since the first catheterization via the
right radial side and visualized right coronary arteries and
revealed no flow limiting lesions, no interventions had been
performed during the first catheterization.  Upon arrival to
CCU, the patient continued to complain of four out of ten
chest pain which was relieved with Nitroglycerin drip and
Morphine.  He was given Aspirin, Plavix, Heparin drip for
possible ongoing cardiac ischemia because the patient had
received TNK at his initial presentation and Heparin drip was
not given due to the concern for increased risk of bleeding.
Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on hospital day two
was not able to assess left ventricular ejection fraction and
wall motion abnormality.  On hospital day three, he was taken
back to the catheterization laboratory again for
catheterization via the left radial side.  The second
