Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for respiratory failure on vent, b/l IJ compression,
large supraglottic SCC tumor and urgent XRT to shrink tumor
burden

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement x 3

History of Present Illness:
61 yo M w/ h/o ETOH abuse, smoker, Supraglottic SCC stage [**Doctor First Name 690**],
initially admitted on [**5-13**] for G tube placement course c/b
respiratory failure, C-diff infection, and psuedomonal PNA.
.
He initially presented with a sore throat, dysphagia and
anorexia who on fiberoptic laryngoscopy found a large
supraglottic mass. A biopsy was done and final pathology
confirmed poorly differentiated SCC stage [**Doctor First Name 690**].  He was admitted
to an OSH on [**2111-5-13**] specifically for a G-tube placement due to
this large subglottic mass.  His course was c/b ETOH withdrawal
requiring benzos prn, then developed PNA with cultures revealing
Psedomonas. He subsequently developed respiratory failure and
was initially intubated on [**2111-5-16**], extubated on [**2111-5-25**].
However, he had to reintubated by ENT on [**2111-5-28**] with question
of  difficulty reintubating due to supraglottic mass. The pt
underwent tracheostomy on [**2111-6-1**].
.
He was initially treated with zosyn for his pseudomonal pna,
then switched to Ceftaz; Pseudomonal culture sensitivities
returned on [**6-8**] and abx were switched to Cefapime and Gent prior
to transfer.
.
His WBC began to rise from 11-->25-->32 with the development of
diarrhea which was C-diff + and initially treated with PO vanco
then switched to PO flagyl.
.
His HCT dropped (28.6 TO 26.9) of unclear etiology and was
transfused 2 UPRBC on [**6-1**], hct increased to 33.4.
.
He started chemotherapy with Carbotaxol x 1 on [**6-4**] and was
called out to the medicine service on [**6-5**]. While on the medicine
service he became tachypneic and hypoxic with O2 sats 70% and
transferred back to the MICU. There are no records of CTA or
chest CTs done during this hypoxic event.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of b/l IJ
clots R>L and possible XRT to shrink tumor burden.

The pt. was initially admitted with a WBC 11.9, however his WBC
continued to drop, as low as 0.6, becoming neutropenic, probably
secondary to dose of CarboTaxol received at the [**Location 1268**] VA.
He received several doses Neupogen, after which his WBC
increased, currently 12.1 on [**2111-6-23**]

MICROBIOLOGY:

.
IMAGING:
CT head [**2111-6-9**]
- No acute intracranial hemorrhage or masses is seen.
- Large bilateral posterior cervical triangle masses, likely
metastatic,
  necrotic lymph nodes.
.
CT chest [**2111-6-9**]
- Extensive necrotic lymphadenopathy of the supraclavicular
region, with
  apparent occlusion of both internal jugular and subclavian
veins.
- Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left
pleural
  effusion, with associated atelectasis involving the entire
right lower
  lobe.
- Biapical opacities may reflect radiation treatment if there is
such a
  history.
- Ground-glass opacities throughout the remainder of the lungs
are
  nonspecific, possibly reflecting edema or infection. A more
focal
  opacity in the lower right upper lobe suggests pneumonia.
- Axillary lymphadenopathy and borderline mediastinal nodes.
- Extensive subcutaneous edema.
.
Chest Xray [**2111-6-9**]
- Multifocal opacities consistent with pneumonia.
- Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
- Tracheostomy tube in appropriate position.

.
MRA of neck [**2111-6-12**]:
- No evidence of arterial occlusion or invasion identified by
large masses
  in the neck.
- There is no evidence of occlusion of the superior vena cava
seen.
- Both jugular veins are occluded, the left vein is occluded in
the upper
  third, while the right vein is occluded by tumor near the
skull base.
- Partial visualization of both subclavian veins with findings
suspicious
  for invasion and extension of tumor through the right internal
jugular
  vein to the junction of right subclavian vein.
.
ECHO [**2111-6-10**]
- EF > 55%
- Normal study. Preserved biventricular cavity sizes with normal

  global and regional systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo M with large supraglottic SCC here for XRT, s/p trach for
resp. failure, now on trach collar.  Also with pseudomonal PNA,
R pleural effusion, and C-diff infection.
.
# Supraglottic SCC with potential compression of bilateral IJs
on MRI. Pt is s/p 1 dose carboplatin/paclitaxel prior to
transfer and was temporarily neutropenic, but now resolved after
G-CSF.  Heme-onc is following and restarted
carboplatin/paclitaxol on [**6-30**] with goal of improving
radiotherapy efficacy.  He is also s/p 15 doses XRT since
arrival in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], for a total of 16 treatments per Rad-onc.  He
had an almost immediate reaction consisting of facial swelling
and erythema after the 1st dose, which is now resolved. He has
had good response to the XRT with significant decrease in size
of his neck mass. Pt is receiving supportive care with pain
control with Dilaudid & Fentanyl prn though has not required
pain control recently. There is a plan for family meeting with
heme-onc, rad-onc, and medicine team today or tomorrow.
.
# Respiratory: Pt is currently satting well on trach collar with
FiO2 of 35%.  Pt had pseudomonal PNA (s/p 12-day cour
