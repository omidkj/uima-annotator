Brief Hospital Course:
52-year-old female with a history of asthma and HIV who present
with 3-5 days of wheezing and shortness of breath.

air and had a peak flow of 270 (baseline of 250) in the
emergency department. She was started on prednisone, standing
nebulizers and antibiotics. She was admitted to the ICU for fear
of decompensation. She remained saturating well on room air
overnight and was sent to the floor. On the floor the patient
felt much better. Her nebulizers were spread to q6hours and she
stated she was at her baseline. The patient had an ambulatory O2
sat which was normal on room air. She was discharged on a 10 day
steroid taper, 5 day course of azithromycin, spiriva, advair,
albuterol nebs, ipratropium nebs. She will follow up with her
primary care physician and pulmonologist in the future.

remained stable. Stools were guaiac negative. She will need to
be follow by her primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may require a
colonoscopy.

# Chest pressure: The patient was ruled out for MI with EKG and
cardiac enzymes. The pressure was likely secondary to her
respiratory status.
