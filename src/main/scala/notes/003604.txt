History of Present Illness:
83 female with history of CAD s/p CABG and DES to LMCA, dCHF,
DMII, ESRD on HD (started last month), COPD, HL, PVD, HTN,
recent admission for colitis ([**2201-5-23**] to [**2201-5-28**]) who reports
never feeling quite same since last discharge. She was doing
well until three days ago when she fell on her back without head
trauma, LOC, chest pain or palpatations while getting up because
her legs gave up. She presented to the ED and was noted to have
hypoglycemia to 42 which improved with D50. She was discharged
home but represented yesterday as she still felt weak and did
not think she could tolerated dialysis yesterday.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.6 HR 68 BP 188/48 RR 16
97%RA
Exam was notable for poor joint sense in L>R LEs, stance and
gait unsteady, unable to ambulate without assistance. Slow but
intact heel-shin. CN II-XII intact, strength 5/5 throughout,
sensation intact. No spine tenderness. Patient was given
kayexelate for K=5.8. CXR was done revealing mild fluid overload
and could not exclude pneumonia. Initially she was medically
cleared for discharge from ED, but patient failed PT eval. She
was seen by case management and admitted to [**Hospital1 **] observation for
dialysis tomorrow morning since she missed HD yesterday.
However, upon getting ready to transfer to the floor, BP was
noted to be 208/59. She was given metoprolol and hydralazine IV
with no improvement in BP. Denied HA, blurry vision or CP at any
time throughout episode. Given the persistently elevated BP, the
decision was made to admit her to the MICU yesterday.
.
In the MICU, she received dialysis this morning with removal of
2L to her dry weight of 63 kg. She was restarted on her home
antihypertensive regimen with nifedipine, metoprolol and
lisinopril. She was tranferred to medicine floor for further
evaluation and management of her weakness.
.
On the floor, she does not report headache, fever, chills, chest
pain, shortness of breath, myalgias, abdominal pain, back pain,
nausea, vomiting or dysuria. She reports bilateral ankle pain L
> R.

Brief Hospital Course:
 83 year old female with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, chronic
diastolic CHF, diabetic neuropathy who presented with subacute
progressive weakness and subsequently missed HD admitted to ICU
with hypertensive urgency.
.
# Hypertensive Urgency: Was likely due to volume overload from
missing HD. BP was unresponsive to medications, but after HD the
following day, her pressures normalized.  2L of fluid was
removed with HD and she returned to dry weight.  She was
discharged with all of her home antihypertensives and on
discharge she was normotensive.

# Weakness/Gait instability: Progressive weakness seems to have
been present over several months. Neuro exam nonfocal.  Pt does
have h/o spinal stenosis, PVD and diabetic neuropathy which
could certainly contribute to feelings of weakness and gait
instability.  She also reported that this has happened after HD,
which is a common HD side effect.  Lastly, on presentation to
ED, she was hypoglycemic which might have explained weakness.  A
B12, folate and ESR level were all normal indicating that
weakness is not secondary to B12/folate deficiency or
inflammatory condition like PMR.  Pt is followed by neurology at
[**Hospital1 18**] for previous CVA and will be followed up by neurology post
discharge.  PT evaluated pt and determined that she was able to
be discharged with home PT.
.
# ESRD: Was dialysed twice during hospital stay.  Will continue
to HD on MWF at [**Hospital1 18**].  She was discharged home on sevelamer,
nephrocaps and Iron.

#Type II Diabetes Mellitus: throughout hospital course, pt was
on ISS.  She was discharged on home regimen and continued with
gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy.
.
#Hyperlipidemia: Pt was discharged home on normal statin dose.

.
#Chronic back pain: Likely secondary to spinal stenosis, which
as per patient will not be managed surgically.
.
#CVA prophylaxis/CAD: Discharged on home regimen of aspirin,
clopidogrel, BB and statin.

No pending results or reports at time of discharge.
