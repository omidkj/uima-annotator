Brief Hospital Course:
Acute jaundice: On presentation most consistent with obstructive
jaundice as with pale stools and dark urine, and elevated alk
phos. Patient had ERCP and sphincterotomy on [**8-21**]. His
bilirubin, LFT and amylase, lipase were trended. Lactate was
0.8. Hemolysis labs were checked as well as hepatitis serologies
which were negative. Levofloxacin was started and continued for
a [**6-11**] day course per ERCP recommendations. A script for
levofloxacin was provided at discharge.
.
Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has a tracheostomy and
has been ventilator dependent since [**2170**]. His home ventilator
settings were continued. His albuterol and atrovent nebulizer
treatments were continued as well as suctioning prn and cough
assist. The patient remained without any respiratory complaints
or complications.
.
Metabolic acidosis: patient with a low bicarb and AG of 20 on
admission. Unclear in etiology, lactate was as above, ketones in
urine but glucose normal. Patient is not uremic, not a known
diabetic. Likely secondary to poor po intake over days prior to
discharge. Given D5 1/2NS IV with resolving gap but bicarb
levels remained low. Will encourage patient to follow-up with
PCP and have labs drawn several days post-discharge; script for
outpatient blood draw was provided.
.
Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy: Patient was continued on
mechanical ventilation per home vent settings and turned
frequently to prevent ulcers.
.
h/o long QT interval, known RBBB: Patient had prior holter
monitor which revealed isolated PVC's and infrequent ventricular
couplets.  He was monitored on telemetry. QT prolonging
medications were avoided and EKGs were followed for any changes.
.
HTN:
