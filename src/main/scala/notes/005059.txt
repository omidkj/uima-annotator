Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17283**] is a 64 yo gentleman who was admitted on [**12-29**] with
unstable angina.  Cardiac catheterization showed LM and
significant vessel disease.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was
inserted due to ongoing angina and marginal hemodynamics. He was
taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] on [**12-30**] for a
CABGx5.  His ejection fraction in the operating room was 20%.
Postoperatively he was hemodynamically unstable for several
days, requiring inotropes and IABP.  On [**1-1**] he was taken to the
cardiac catheterization lab due to marginal hemodynamics which
showed that all of his bypass grafts were patent.  He also had
moderate hypoxia and an interventional pulmonary consult was
obtained.  It was recommended that the patient receive
bronchodilators.  His hypoxia gradually resolved and his
ventilator was weaned.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor in an
attempt to wean his inotropes, but it was discontinued due to an
elevated creatinine.  By POD#9 his inotropes were weaned and the
patient was able to diurese.  He was extubated from mechanical
ventilation on POD#11, but required intermittent BiPAP and was
re intubated on POD#14 due to hypoxia and work of breathing.
The patient underwent CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary emboli
which showed 2 small pulmonary emboli which were thought to be
clinically insignificant, but it was recommended that he be
anticoagulated.  He had bilateral lower extremity venous
dopplers preformed which were negative for evidence of DVT.  On
POD#19 he self extubated and after several hours was re
intubated for hypoxia and work of breathing.  On POD#19 he
underwent bedside tracheostomy and PEG placement.  He continued
to wean on the ventilator.  On POD#21 he underwent a
transthoracic echocardiogram which showed his ejection fraction
had improved to 30% with no significant valvular abnormalities.
On [**1-21**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained due to the patients
continued elevated blood sugar.  It was recommended that the
patient be started on Lantus insulin which was started without
difficulty.
