History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo man with a h/o CAD, s/p CABG in [**2112**],and DES
[**8-5**] and [**7-6**], s/p AVR in [**2120**], and hyperlipidemia who presents
with 1 month of worsening CP on exertion and DOE. Approximately
1 month ago, Mr. [**Known lastname **] noted worsening chest pain on exertion and
DOE which have been worsening over the last 4 weeks.
Approximately 1 week ago, he also noted resting shoulder pain,
and nocturnal cough. Pain responded to nitro at home. He denies
nausea, lightheadedness, dizziness, leg swelling, palps. Denies
fevers, chills, sick contacts or cold symptoms. Does endorse a
nonproductive cough for the last 3 days. Denies recent increase
in salt intake.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.0; 142/75; 76; 20; 97%RA. Labs
significant for Trop 0.06; BNP [**2075**] with no prior. EKG with new
TWI in I, aVL, V4-V6. CXR showed low lung volumes, patchy focal
infiltrate in LLL which may indicate early pneumonia vs
aspiration, no pulmonary edema. CTA chest showed no PE, b/l
pleural effusions and septal thickening c/w fluid overload,
bibasilar consolidations, atelectasis vs pneumonia. He developed
an episode of CP in the ED that resolved with 1 SL nitro.
Patient was given ASA 325mg, Lasix 20mg IV, Levofloxacin 750mg
IV, Nitro 0.4mg SL x1. Blood cultures were drawn. Vitals on
transfer were 98.0, 62 NSR, 22 RR, 104/53, 92% 4L NC.  He
diuresed 800 cc of urine to 20mg IV of lasix.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable without CP or
SOB, feels well.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,  hemoptysis, or red
stools. He does endorese black stools x several months. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TEE:
-No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
-There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with EF 30% with moderate inferoseptal wall
hypokinesis.
-The appearance of the ascending aorta is consistent with a
normal tube graft.
-A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. [The amount of regurgitation present is
normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] No abnormal
perivalvular leak is appreciated.
-The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
-There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
75M with complex cardiac history.  He underwent CABG in [**2112**] and
a redo sternotomy, AVR in [**2120**] and then stented in [**2124**] and
[**2125**].  Over the past month he has developed progressive DOE and
chest pain.
 He presented to the ED with an NSTEMI and new onset CHF on
[**2128-8-6**].  Echo revealed severe bioprosthetic Aortic Valve
stenosis with a valve area 0.8-1.0cm2. Cath revealed
multi-vessel CAD. Cardiac surgery is consulted for 3rd time
sternotomy, AVR,CABG evaluation.
On [**2128-8-16**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent

1. Third time redo sternotomy.
2. Second time aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm onyx
    mechanical valve, reference number [**Serial Number 79137**], serial
    number [**Serial Number 79138**].
3. Redo CABG times 2 with reverse saphenous vein graft from
    the neo ascending aorta to the preexisting saphenous
    vein graft to the right coronary artery; reverse
    saphenous vein graft from the neo ascending aorta to the
    preexisting OM1 vein graft.
4. Endoscopic vein harvesting.
5. Replacement of ascending aorta  with a 28 mm tube graft
    using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
His chest was left open at the end of the case despite multiple
blood products, the patient was coagulopathic and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
decided to pack the chest and the the chest and the chest open.
The patient was taken directly from the OR to the ICU for
ongoing post-op care and management. He was on milrinone, epi,
vasopressin, Neo and propofol. He was taken back tothe operating
room on POD#1 and his chest was closed. He was weaned and
extubated on POD#2. He was weaned off his inotropes and was
hypertensive and refractory to po anti-hypertensives and started
on a nicardipine drip. The oral antihypertensives were increased
and the nicardipine was weaned off. He was started on coumadin
for mechcanical AVR. He was started on statin, ace, betablocker
and lasix therapies. despite aggressive diuresis he continued to
have firm taut edema of his lower extremities. He continued to
progress quickly and was transferred to the stepdown unit on
POD#6. He was evaluated by physical
