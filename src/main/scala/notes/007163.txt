[**2168-6-17**] ECHO
Prebypass

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed.
2.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
3.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. Central jet with a wide base. Vena
contracta is 4mm.

Post Bypass
Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine.

1. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
2. Mitral regurgitation persists.
3. Aorta intact post decannulation.

[**2168-6-20**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound
Extremely limited study due to patient's body habitus and
central line with overlying dressings obscuring the common
femoral veins. There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
the proximal and mid SFV, or the popliteal veins.

[**2168-6-20**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
large pericardial effusion. The effusion appears loculated and
is dustrubuted along the inferiro and posterior walls of the
left ventricle. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

[**2168-6-21**] Liver Ultrasound
Secondary to subcutaneous gas from recent surgical procedure, no
ultrasound evaluation can be made of the intra-abdominal organs.

[**2168-6-25**] CT Guided Cholecystostomy
Status post successful percutaneous cholecystostomy under CT
guidance.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2168-7-16**] 10:34 AM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: r/o mediastinitis
Field of view: 38

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man with s/p cabg, open chest for decreased CO, WBC
63K
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o mediastinitis
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT of the chest.

INDICATION: 63-year-old male status post CABG, presenting with
increased white blood cell count of 20,000 today. Assess for
mediastinitis.

COMPARISONS: [**2168-7-3**].

TECHNIQUE: Following the administration of 75 cc of Optiray
intravenous contrast, MDCT axial images were acquired from the
thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen. Coronal reformatted images
were then obtained. 1.25-mm thin sections through the chest were
also obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post
median sternotomy and CABG. There are associated postoperative
changes in the anterior chest. There are several foci of air
along the superficial aspect of the anterior chest. No air is
present within the mediastinum. However, on today's examination,
just anterior to the heart, there appears to be a low- density
area with diffuse fat stranding, particularly along the inferior
margin which is suspicious for inflammatory. This area extends
superiorly along the anterior aspect of the pericardium. The
heart is enlarged. There are diffuse atherosclerotic
calcifications of the right coronary, left anterior descending,
and left circumflex arteries respectively. There are multiple
prominent lymph nodes in the prevascular space, the largest of
which measures 11 mm in short-axis dimension (4:64). New on
today's examination within the left upper lobe are several
fluid-attenuation collections. The largest collection is located
superiorly and measures 6.2 x 3.5 cm and has a mildly denser
rim. There is a possible communication with a more superiorly
located posteromedial simple-attenuation collection which
measures 3.7 x 2.7 cm (2:12). There is a small-to-moderate left
pleural effusion which may contain some proteinaceous material
as it is higher in attenuation than simple fluid. There is
associated mild compressive atelectasis. The left lower lobe
pleural effusion is not significantly changed compared to the
previous examination. There is right lower lobe atelectasis
which also appears unchanged compared to the previous
examination. There is a small, 3-mm pulmonary nodule within the
right middle lobe, lateral aspect (3:34).

Limited views of the lung bases again demonstrate bilateral
adrenal nodules which are incompletely imaged. The largest is
located within the left adrenal gland and measures approximately
1.7 x 1.3 cm. A right-sided nodule measures approximately 1.3 x
1.0 cm. A tube can be seen within the stomach. There is at least
one calcification within the head of the pancreas. Limited non-
contrast views of the liver and spleen are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. No foci of air within the mediastinum to suggest
mediastinitis. However, there is increase
