Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was initially seen on HD #2. Felt pt would be best suited
for bypass surgery, but first needed work-up. Work-up included
PFT's, Carotid U/S, Echo, ABI, and heart failure consult. After
work-up, pt was brought to the OR on HD #4 and underwent a CABG.
Please see op note. Pt. tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU in stable condition.  After surgery, he
was extubated by post op day 1. He remained on Levophed and
milrinone, which were weaned to off by post op day three. Chest
tubes, pacing wires, and Foley catheter were all removed per
protocol. He was transferred to the step down unit on post op
day 5. An echocardiogram on POD #6 showed severe left
ventricular hypokinesis, and mildly dyskinetic apex and EF 20%
(improved from pre-op by 5%). He was started on anticoagulation
with Coumadin for low EF on POD #7. He improved slowly with no
complications and was ready for discharge on POD #9.
