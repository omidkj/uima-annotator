Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, weakness, incontinence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with past medical history of aortic
stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and chronic cough who presented
with weakness, stool incontinence, confusion, and questionable
respiratory symptoms.  On the morning of admission the patient
apparently had diarrhea in her bed and was unable to recognize a
regular visitor.  Apparently, these were both acute developments
as she is rarely confused and does not have incontinence at
baseline.  She was also having some increased secretions and
cough per her daughter (the patient minimizes this).  No fevers
or chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, lower extremity
edema, orthopnea, or PND per the patient's report in retrospect.
 When her daughter came to see her later in the day on the day
of admission she noted she was quite weak and unable to walk
without assistance, which is not her baseline, though she does
note her mother has been weaker and less mobile recently
secondary to her spinal stenosis.  Upon noting he decreased
ability to ambulate her daughter became quite concerned and the
patient was brought to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department for
further evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department VS: 98.7, 116/70, HR 102, RR
16, 100% 2L NC.  Her chest radiograph was without pneumonia and
UA was without signs of infection.  Given the patient's
confusion remained unchanged she was admitted to medicine after
receiving a liter of IV fluids.  On the floor, the patient
denied any major complaints and seemed much closer to her
baseline mental status.

OTHER RESULTS
==============
Chest Radiograph [**2125-4-30**]:
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.

ECG [**2125-5-1**]: Sinus rhythm. Consider prior anterior myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-8-23**] atrial
ectopy is no longer recorded. There is diffuse non-specific ST-T
wave flattening with a decrease in the limb lead voltage.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

CXR [**2125-5-1**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-30**], there is
continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Ectasia of the
aorta persists. Generalized prominence of interstitial markings
could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung
disease, or both. No acute focal pneumonia.

Echocardiogram [**2125-5-1**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2123-2-2**], no major change is evident.

ECG [**2125-5-2**]:
Normal sinus rhythm. Deep T wave inversions in the inferolateral
leads.
Left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing
sinus
tachycardia has resolved. T wave inversions are more marked. R
wave
progression is improved.

Chest Radiograph [**2125-5-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
Bibasilar airspace opacities which may be attributed to
atelectasis versus
aspiration pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. Clinical
correlation is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of hypertension, moderate aortic
stenosis, and mitral regurgitation presenting with cough,
increased secretions, weakness, and stool incontinence presumed
due to viral syndrome with course complicated by pulmonary edema
and respiratory distress requiring ICU stay.

1)Viral bronchitis:  The patient denied dyspnea on presentation
and numerous attempts were made to seek out a frank pulmonary
bacterial infection given accounts of cough and then respiratory
decompensation. Chest radiograph was never read as consistent
with pneumonia until possibly on [**2125-5-3**] but by that point
patient had been afebrile and improving and there was no reason
to suspect aspiration or infection.  It is possible the patient
had a viral bronchitis precipitating her initial symptoms but
this is nearly impossible to prove.

2)Acute vs Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: On the
morning of [**2125-5-1**] the patient developed fairly acute shortness
of breath consistent with flash pulmonary edema.  The exact
etiology of this acute decompensation of presumed diastolic
failure is unknown.   This did occur in the context of rising
cardiac enyzmes but as inter NSTEMI echo was within normal
limits it seems unlikely that area infarcted was large enough to
cause significant pump dysfunction.  It seems more likely that
the fluid the patient had received overnight and and element of
hypertension in the context of AS precipitated acute volume
overload in the LV and pulmonary edema.  The patient responded
well to diuresis with furosemide and creatinine remained stable.
 She was euvolemic on the floor and prior to discharge was
restarted on her home triamterene with no signs of fluid
overload. Her diltiazem dose was increased to 240mg PO daily.
Echocardiogram obtained during enzyme elevation showed
preserved, normal EF.

3) NSTEMI/CAD: Cardiology was alerted during enzyme rise, but as
the patient was el
