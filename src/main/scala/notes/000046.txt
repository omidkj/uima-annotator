Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
coffee ground emesis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
Patient is severely demented at baseline and history was
obtained via [**Hospital1 1501**] records.
.
This is a 76 y/o F with history of CHF, Afib on coumadin, HTN,
dementia who prsented from her living facility after vomiting
coffee grounds earlier today. Per records, patient was suffering
from constipation. Bowel regimen was aggressively uptitrated and
on day prior to admission, patient was given magnesium citrate.
Patient began vomiting coffee grounds on several occasions.
Unclear if patient had fevers or chills, or abdominal
discomfort.
.
In ED patient's initially VS were 99.7 140 167/110 22 99%4LNC.
Patient triggered for HR. Exam was unrevealing. Initial EKG
demonostrated SVT. Patient was given a total of 12mg of
adenosine which revealed atrial flutter. Patient was given a
total of 40mg IV diltiazem and 1LNS. NGL was completed which
showed 1L coffee grounds with clots. This apparently cleared
with an additional 500cc NS. GI was consulted and planed to
scope patient in AM. Patient was started protonix gtt. Lab
findings were significant for a WBC of 18, Hct of 44.5 (both
which were thought to be hemoconcentrated) and a Na of 129 with
Cr of 1.2. INR was noted to be 3.3. Patient received a total of
10mg of vitamin K and 1 unit of FFP. Lastly pt spiked to 101;
blood cultures were taken and pt was given ceftriaxone for ?UTI.
Prior to transfer, vital signs were 125/62 144 (still in
flutter) 98% RA.
.
In the MICU, patient was resting comfortable complaining of
thirst.

Imaging:
EGD:
Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Grade D esophagitis with stigmata of recent bleeding
was seen starting at 15 cm from the incisors to the GE junction,
compatible with severe erosive esophagitis most likely from
GERD.
Stomach:
 Excavated Lesions Multiple superficial non-bleeding ulcers
ranging in size from 1 cm to 1 cm were found in the fundus,
stomach body, and antrum .
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
Impression: Grade D esophagitis in the From 15cm to the GE
junction compatible with severe erosive esophagitis most likely
from GERD
Ulcers in the fundus, stomach body, and antrum
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 84029**] clinic in 4 weeks
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 9891**]
Start high dose ppi (protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] or equivalent) for 6
weeks
Avoid Nsaids

CT ABD/PELVIS ([**7-26**]):
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is dependent subsegmental
atelectasis at the lung bases. The heart is enlarged without
pericardial effusion. There is coronary artery and thoracic
aortic atherosclerotic calcification.

The liver, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The
gallbladder is surgically absent. A poorly evaluated 13-mm
hypodensity arising from the posterior aspect of the pancreatic
body may be new from the prior study. There is fatty atrophy of
the pancreas. The non-opacified stomach and intra-abdominal
loops of small bowel are normal without evidence of obstruction.
A nasogastric tube terminates in the gastric fundus. There is
colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.

There is mild bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Within
the right
kidney, there is a fat-fluid level in an anterior interpolar
calyx (2A:35). In addition, a fat-fluid level is noted within
the mid right ureter (2A:66). Multiple hypodensities in the
bilateral kidneys are mostly new compared to [**2189**] and are too
small to further characterize, but may represent cysts. There
has been interval atrophy of both kidneys. In addition, cortical
thinning in the upper pole of the right kidney suggests prior
infection or ischemia.

There is no free air or fluid in the abdomen. There are no
mesenteric lymph nodes meeting CT criteria for pathologic
enlargement. A left para-aortic lymph node measuring 16 mm is
similar to the prior study (2A:42). There is atherosclerotic
calcification of the abdominal aorta which is of normal caliber
throughout. Vascular calcifications are also noted in the branch
vessels.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a tiny fat-fluid level
within the
anterior portion of the bladder (2A:82). The distal ureters are
dilated
bilaterally, and scattered areas of mild urothelial enhancement
are seen
bilaterally. The urinary bladder is distended with irregular and
lobulated
appearance of the wall, with diverticula. Heterogeneity is noted
in the
region of the endometrium, possibly due to an underlying polyp
or fibroid.
Adnexa and sigmoid colon are normal. There is a large amount of
stool within the rectum. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy meeting CT criteria for
pathologic enlargement is noted.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is
identified. There is multilevel degenerative change of the
thoracolumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of bowel obstruction.

2. Irregular lobulated appearance of the bladder wall with
diverticula
suggests neurogenic bladder and clinical correlation is
recommended.
Mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis may be due to bladder
distention. Mild urothelial enhancement could be seen with
infect
