Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
71F with hx of COPD (on home O2 with cor pulmonale), DM2,
history of NSTEMI, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, diastolic
dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension presents s/p PEA arrest
during hip fracture surgery.  2 weeks prior to admission,
patient had 2 falls, daughter spoke with witness of fall who
reported patient "blacked out".  On [**10-8**], patient had MVA, hit a
tree but refused to go to the ER, no major injuries.  On [**10-11**],
she had to lower herself to the floor to become comfortable
because of "swollen legs", but lost balance and fell on her
buttocks, causing a left hip fracture, which brought her to the
hospital the day after falling.  Minimal PO intake in days prior
to admission.

Upon admission to OSH ED, found to have K+ 6.7, given calcium
gluconate, D50 with insulin, repeat K was 5.2.  CK 66, Trop
0.04.  CXR showed hyperinflation and left costophrenic angle
blunting.  ECG in complete heart block with peaked T waves.
Dual chamber atrial sensing pacer placed [**2144-10-13**], then had hip
fracture surgery [**2144-10-14**].  Also received 1 unit PRBC transfusion
for dropping Hct ? GI bleed per family, they were told she would
need outpt colonscopy.

Towards closing of surgery, her BP suddenly dropped, she went
into PEA arrest, was given epi and atropine and CPR was
completed for 2-3 minutes with restoration of pulse.  Echo was
completed that showed ? new anterior wall motion abnormality,
but hard to assess because she was paced.  [**Hospital 56108**]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath and CCU management.

Update before arriving to floor: Clean coronaries found during
catheterization, fighting tube, mean PCWP 38, biventricular
failure, mean RA 20, RV 55/20, PA mean 47, CI 4.2, latest ABG
7.19/67/349/27 Vent 420mL, 26, 100% FiO2, 5 PEEP, K 3.6, Lactate
1.0, H/H 9.8/29, no central line access, on 5mcg dopamine
peripherally, urine cloudy 100cc, received 300mL NS bolus, on
heparin for possible PE

On review of systems, she is intubated and sedated, not
responding to stimuli.  Upon arrival to the floor patient no
longer on dopamine drip, BP dropped to 50s/30s with MAPs 40s, HR
120s ventricular paced regular p waves, faint carotid pulses
felt, started phenylephrine drip with rapid increase in MAPs to
70s and greater palpable pulses.

Per family, cardiac review of systems is notable for absence
TIA, stroke, palpitations, dysphagia, odynophagia, moves bowels
1/day, occasionally BRBPR [**3-17**] hemorrhoids, no melena, has
diarrhea occasionally, + ankle edema, no orthopnea, no PND, no
chest pain, baseline is 0.5-1 flight of stairs then needs to
stop secondary to SOB no CP.

Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2144-10-14**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
revealed
no angiographically significant disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right
(RVEDP=20mmHg)
and left (PCW=38mmHg) sided filling pressures. There was
moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension (SBP=56mmHg). Systemic pressures
were
normal while on 5mcg/kg/min of dopamine. The cardiac index was
normal
(CI=3.1l/min/m2).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures
.
ECG Study Date of [**2144-10-14**]
The patient is atrial sensed and ventricular paced at a rate of
111. There is an intraventricular conduction delay with
secondary ST-T wave changes. On the prior tracing of [**2138-8-12**],
the patient was in normal sinus rhythm. Therefore, comparisons
are not valid.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2144-10-14**]
FINDINGS: No pneumothorax. The patient is newly intubated, the
tip of the
ETT projects 4.5 cm above the carina. Expected course of the
nasogastric
tube. Newly inserted right pectoral pacemaker with expected
course of the
leads. Slight costophrenic angle blunting due to old pleural
scar, no
evidence of recent pleur
