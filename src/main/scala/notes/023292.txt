Pertinent Results:
[**6-5**] CT head noncontrast: 1. New subgaleal fluid collection in
the scalp overlying the right craniotomy site.
2. Post-right frontal lobectomy, with resolved post-operative
pneumocephalus. No superimposed acute intracranial process
detected.

[**2114-6-6**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received
a
right pectoral Port-A-Cath. The Port-A-Cath is in correct
position. There
are no complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. No acute lung
parenchymal changes.  No pleural effusions. No pneumonia, no
pulmonary edema. Normal hilar and mediastinal contours, normal
size of the cardiac silhouette.

[**2114-6-7**] CSF cytology
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**2114-6-8**] CXR
The right Port-A-Cath is again visualized. There is no
pneumothorax. There is a new area of opacity in the left lower
lung that
could represent volume loss or infiltrate. Small amount of
volume loss in the right lower lung as well. Overall, the
appearance has worsened compared to the study from two days
prior

[**2114-6-9**] CT head
1. Unchanged size of a subgaleal fluid collection communicating
with the
epidural space, however, neighboring increased soft tissue
swelling is
present.This may represent a pseudomeningocele.
2. Post-right frontal craniotomy changes. No superimposed acute
intracranial process detected. No new mass effect.

[**2114-6-9**] CT head
Unchanged appearance of a right frontal
pseudomeningocele/extra-axial fluid collection. There is
expected mild enhancement of the overlying subcutaneous soft
tissues, with some stranding and swelling posteriorly. No
abnormal intracranial enhancement is detected.  While no
definite signs of an abscess are seen, infection/inflammation of
this
collection cannot be excluded by imaging alone.

[**2114-6-11**] ECG
Sinus tachycardia, rate 106. Left atrial abnormality. The
tracing is
otherwise, within normal limits

[**2114-6-11**] CT head
Stable to slightly decreased right frontal extra-axial fluid
collection, with minimally increased size of right frontal
subgaleal fluid
collection.

[**2114-6-11**] CTA chest
Tiny, non-occlusive, marginal, filling defects in the
subsegmental branches of right upper and left lower lobe are
likely small pulmonary emboli, not necessarily acute. No
evidence of emboli in main, lobar, and segmental branches.

[**2114-6-12**] CXR
In comparison with study of [**6-8**], there is a little overall
change.
Continued opacification at the left base with poor visualization
of the
costophrenic angle is consistent with atelectatic changes in the
left lower lobe and possibl small effusion. No vascular
congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Port-A-Cath position is
unchanged.

[**2114-6-12**] LE US
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg

[**2114-6-13**] CXR
Cardiac size is top normal accentuated by low lung volumes. Left
lower lobe atelectasis has improved. There is mild vascular
congestion. There is no pneumothorax. Right Port-A-Cath tip is
in unchanged position. There are no enlarging pleural effusions.


[**2114-6-15**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever and low saturations.
Cardiac size is top normal.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The right Port-A-Cath tip is
in the right atrium, which is difficult to visualize.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89057**] was admitted from clinic on [**6-5**] for draining right
craniotomy site.  CT head demostrated a large subgaleal fluid
collection. Aspiration of the collection was performed on [**6-7**] at
the bedside in a sterile fashion. He head was wrapped with
Coban. The gram stain showed no poly's and no organisms. On 5.4
the colelction had reaccumulated so ti was again tapped and the
fluid was sent. the head was then wrapped again. the fluid
showed 2+ GPCs in clusters and staph aureus. He was started on
vancomycin and ceftaz and ID was consulted. His mental status
declined and his head wrap was loosened.

On [**6-9**] he was febrile to 102 and he was panculutred. He had a
head CT with adn without contrast which showed no suigns of
infection but persistent fluid collection. On 5.6 he had
periorbital edema and a vanomycin rough of 15. He had blood
cultures sent as well and his vancomycin was discontinued and he
was started on Nafcillin.

On [**6-11**] his O2 sats decreased to the 80's, was febrile to 102
axillary, and tachycardic to 117. He had a CTA chest and head CT
and was sent to the unit. Prelim reads of his CTA chest showed
PE so he was started on a heparin gtt. Final read of the CTA
Chest showed RUL and LLL subsegmental non-occlusive PE likely
subacute/chronic. On [**6-12**] his exam was improved and had LENIS
which were negative and his heparin gtt was stopped.

On [**6-13**] and [**6-16**] he was neurologically stable on Q2 hr neuro
check. He had some intermittent delirium. He was on nafcillin
per the ID team.

On [**6-19**] the ID team recommended adding rifampin to pt's ABx
regimen.  He was given one dose in house and tolerated it well.
He was set up with ID follow-up appointments, and they will
deter
