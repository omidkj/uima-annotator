History of Present Illness:
49 yo morbidly obese female who weighs 310 lb with hx of IDDM,
MRSA bacteremia, and low back pain was transferred from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] today.  Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with 16
hour history of fevers and left low back pain.  She also
complained of dysuria and abdominal discomfort 3 days prior to
admission and was seen by her PCP but her urine culture was
negative.  The night prior to admission, she experienced fever
of 101.5, chills, and diaphoresis.  She was initially admitted
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for evaluation of her fever and flank pain.  She
was initially treated with Levaquin but was started on
Vancomycin 1g q12 once the blood culture grew out MRSA.  Blood
culture was positive for MRSA on multiple occasion and showed no
growth on [**7-25**].  Patient continued to spike fever with Tm=105.1
on [**2135-7-26**].  At that time Gentamycin was added for synergy after
ID consult.  TEE was done which was negative for any valvular
vegetation.  Patient has left paraspinal tenderness with high
grade MRSA bacteremia of unknown source, MRI of the L spine was
recommended to rule out epidural abscess.  However, patient is
claustrophobic  and can only do either open MRI or MRI under
general anesthesia.  For that reason, patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] to have the MRI done under general anesthesia.  Dr.
