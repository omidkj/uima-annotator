COUMADIN (WARIFIN)

What is warfarin?
Warfarin is the generic name for Coumadin?????? (brand or trade
name).
Warfarin belongs to a class of medications called
anticoagulants, which help prevent clots from forming in your
blood and or keep grafts open.

Why am I taking warfarin?
You are taking warfarin because you have a medical condition
that puts you at risk for forming dangerous blood clots, or to
keep open vessels that have stents and or vessels that allow
blood to flow for ischemic leg symptoms.
How do I take warfarin?
Warfarin is taken once daily at the same time every day,
preferably in the evening, with or without food.
If you miss a dose of warfarin, take the missed dose as soon as
possible on the same day. If you forget, do not double up the
next day! Write the day of your missed dose on your calendar and
let your health care provider know at your next visit.

Why is warfarin use monitored so carefully?
