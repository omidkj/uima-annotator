Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 58 yo with DM, HTN, p/w syncope and found to have massive B
pulmonary emboli
.
1. Pulmonary embolus:
The patient's likely source of her clot was her long plane ride.
She had calf pain and it is questionable if she had a DVT which
led to the embolus. Her malignancy screen is up to date for her
age. She has no history of dvt, no ocp use and does not smoke.
Her hypercoaguability workup is pending (Protein C Antigen;
Protein S Antigen; Anti-Cardiolipin Antibody; Prothrombin
Mutation Analysis; Homocysteine). Her Leni's were negative. A CT
of her abdomen and pelvis did not reveal evidence of IVC clot.
She was maintained on a heparin drip until she therapeutic on
coumadin.
She will need close follow up with her PCP (for INR monitoring)
and [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. She also has a follow up appointment with the
pulmonology clinic scheduled.
.
# Diabetes:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71455**] is a type II diabetic. She was initially controlled
with sliding scale insulin protocols but was transitioned back
to her home regimen in anticipation of discharge. Her blood
sugars were somewhat elevated throughout her hospitalization and
she should likely have a repeat A1c and medication eval by per
primary care provider after discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Ms. [**Known lastname 71455**] was hypertensive on floor and was
maintained on her home regimen of diltiazem. Her lisinopril was
up titrated to attempt to improve her BP control. We will
discharge her on the new regimen and she should follow up with
her primary care provider for repeat hypertension evaluation.
.
# Cardiac
a) Ischemia: The patient had EKG changes (related to PE), and
Tropoinin elevation (likely from RV strain). Given the RV strain
noted on Echo once this resolves the troponin will likely
resolve as well. She did not have any other indication of
ischemic cardiac disease. She was maintained on daily aspirin,
ACE inhibitor, and lipitor. She should have a repeat EKG in the
future to eval for resolution of her strain changes.

.
b) Pump: RV strain with severe free-wall hypokinesis secondary
to PE seen on ECHO. Preload reduction was avoided. The patient
remained asymptomatic in hospital. She should have a repeat ECHO
in a few months to re-evaluate.

.
c) Rhythm: She was in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
hospitalization.
