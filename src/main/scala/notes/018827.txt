 84 yo presenting with AFIB, HTN, CHF who presented with SOB
since yesterday. Pt resides at [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay NH, and on morning
pill administration (0530) pt was found to have room air oxygen
sats in 70s, as well as SOB and congestion. Facemask 5L O2 was
placed at NH and sats improved to 93%. BP at NH was 148/82.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98 P 87 BP 195/76 RR 40 O2sat 93%
on NRB. The pt did not require bipap, and was found to have
crackles and edema on exam. Pt had UA concerning for UTI,
lactate was 2.2, WBC 20, Creatinine was 1.4, which may be
baseline or slightly elevated from baseline. Troponin was 0.02,
and on recent admission in [**8-31**] Trop was 0.03. Patient was given
nitro gtt, lasix 40 IV x1, zosyn and tylenol. Vanco was written
for, but pt did not receive it before transfer to the ICU.
Reason for ICU admission was that pt still requiring nitro gtt.

Echo. [**2132-9-26**].
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-9-25**],
pulmonary pressures are lower. The other findings are similar.
.
CXR.  [**2132-9-26**].
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with interval development of
pulmonary edema
and mild congestive heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old woman with history of DM, HL, diastolic CHF,
admitted with respiratory distress and likely flash pulmonary
edema [**2-25**] hypertensive urgency, perhaps provoked by underlying
UTI.
.
# Acute Pulmonary Edema - Initially was treated in MICU with
lasix IV and nitro gtt. SOB improved. CXR consistent with
pulmonary edema. Thought to have flashed in setting of elevated
BP with hx of diastolic HF. Oxygen requirements decreased with
diuresis. Echo ruled out systolic dysfunction with EF>55%. On
the floor, continued diuresis with IV Lasix with significant
improvement of her breathing.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Echo with unchanged from prior
with EF>55%. Tx with lasix for fluid overload. Continued ACE-I
and atenolol. Initiated salt restriction and 2L fluid
restriction. She was discharged on her home doses of the
atenolol and lisinopril.
.
# Urinary tract infection: Pt reports urinary frequency leading
up to her admission. Received zosyn x 1 in Ed, cefepime x 1 in
MICU. Was then changed to cipro. Initial UA positive for UTI and
culture showed GNR. She was treated with Cirpo IV and discharged
on a 14 day po course, as pt had a foley throughout her
hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension: BP initially controlled with nitro gtt
initially. Pt continued on amlodpine, atenolol and lisinopril
throughout her stay to manage high BP with adequate control.
.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: At baseline Cr 1.4 with slight
increase to Cr 1.8 in the setting of Lasix diuresis.
.
# Anemia: Pt is at recent baseline hct (29). Pt was seen in [**Month (only) **]
by hematology, and was diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease
secondary to chronic renal failure.
