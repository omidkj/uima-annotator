Brief Hospital Course:
Pt patient was admitted to the medial service and to the MICU.
She was transfused 2 units of PRBC, which she had a poor
response to.  Gastroenterology was consulted for possible
endoscopy.  She received another 3 units of blood prior to
endoscopy, which was only showed blood in the lumen of the
bowel, no active bleeding.  Upper endoscopy was unremarkable.
The patient had tagged red cell scan on HD2 which was
inconclusive.  Capsule endoscopy was inconclusive as well.  This
was unsuccessful as well.  On HD 3 the surgical service was
consulted for possible operative management of the bleed.  We
recommended repeat tagged RBC scan, which was suggestive of a
bleed in the region of the splenic flexure.  The patient was
then brought to IR for an attempt to coil any active lesions.
They we able to see the SMA which showed no active
extravagation, but from the arteriogram was only supplying up to
the right colon.  Since the bleeding scan was suggestive of a
splenic flexure source, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] angio was attempted, but was
unsuccessful.  The over the next day, the patient continued to
drop her HCT, requiring continued transfusion.  She was then
brought to the operating room on HD 6 (after a total of 14 units
of blood) for left colectomy, transverse colostomy, and
cholecystectomy of a gall bladder incidentally full of stones.
She was left intubated at the end of the case

On POD 1 she received multiple boluses for low urine output and
hypotension, but her Hct was stable at 31.  Otherwise did well.
POD 2 a vent wean was attempted but the patient became acidoic
(pH 7.2) on CPAP, so she was put onto AC.  POD 3 brought a
corrected acidosis, and echo was done showing a normal EF, but
severe AS.  By POD 4 she was 35L positive, and her HCT had
drifted to 27.  Lasix was started, with good mobilization.  On
POD 6 her ostomy started to function, so TF were begun.
Throughout this time, a slow vent wean had been in progress.  On
POD 9 she had to be put back on AC, as she once again became
acidoic.  POD 10 lasix drip was started, and we were able to
remove a great deal of fluid (-3L).  By POD 12 she was on a
minimum of vent support, so extubation was attempted.
Unfortunately, this failed, and an urgent reintubation was
performed.  POD 15 she received tracheostomy in the OR, this was
uneventful.  POD 17 she spiked a fever to 101.9.  She was
started empirically on Vancomycin and zosyn.  Cultures were
drawn, CXR which showed infiltrate was taken and her CVL was
resited.  Cultures grew back pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn, so
Vanco was d/c??????ed.  She was bronched as well, which was
unremarkable.  BAL grew out the same pseudomonas.  She has
finished a 10 course of Zosyn, and remained afebrile.  We have
been able to wean her to CPAP 5/5 and are now starting trach
mask trial.
