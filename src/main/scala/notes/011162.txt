Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
ICU issue: pt has a trach

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
48F lives at [**Hospital3 672**] rehab with vegetative state s/p
pontine hemorrhage [**7-12**], now presents with fever. She was
previously normal functioning with HTN and tobacco use and had a
pontine hemorrhage on [**2170-7-10**]. She was treated at [**Hospital3 9947**] from [**Date range (1) 68715**]. Per OSH records, the pt was requiring
mechanical ventilation at [**Hospital1 2177**], later developing Ventilator PNA,
and ultimately requiring trach and PEG placement, and was
dicharged to the rehab. Neurology and neurosurgery consultants
reportedly assessed the prognosis as quite poor. I spoke on the
phone with nursing staff at the rehab facility who stated that
the pt was having no signs of verbal or non-verbal communication
or interaction. Also of note, the pt was having unstable and
fluctuating temperatures at the rehab since her admission and
intermittently was requiring cooling blankets.
Last night the pt had a temp at the rehab to 107.7. Pt was also
observed to vomit x2. Sats were remaining at 95%. The temp
remained elevated to 106 and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.
In the ED, VS temp 102 p124 bp110/70 16 99% on trach mask. She
was noted to have an elevated WBC count to 17.4 and CXR was
initially read as c/w PNA. Pt was given Vanc/ceftaz, NS x 3L.
RSC central line was placed and pt admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

CXR [**9-21**] - FINDINGS: Support tubes and lines previously
described are stable. There are reduced lung volumes with
resultant bronchovascular crowding. Mild superimposed edema
persists. No new focal consolidation is seen. The mediastinum is
stable with cardiomegaly. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
noted.

CT head [**9-19**] - There are areas of low attenuation within the
pons, which likely represent changes from the patient's known
prior pontine hemorrhage. No intracranial hemorrhages are
identified. The ventricles are symmetric, there is no shift of
normally midline structures. There are several areas of low
attenuation within the subcortical white matter, which may
represent changes from chronic small vessel ischemic infarct,
though the patient is slightly young to have these findings. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The soft tissue
and osseous structures are within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course:
48F lives at [**Hospital3 672**] rehab with vegetative state s/p
pontine hemorrhage [**7-12**], now presents with fever.
.
1. Fever/leukocytosis: We initially began empiric CAP treatment
with Zosyn and Vancomycin, however it was felt that given the
chest films unimpressive for pneumonia, it was more likely to be
a bronchitis that would be better treated with a course of
azithromycin 500mg QD for 10 days. Neurology evaluated the
patient and felt that her high temperatures are secondary to
autoregulatory temperature instability. Blood, urine culture and
chest xray were unremarkable for signs of infection and this was
not felt to be a CNS infection that required an LP. She will
require tylenol round the clock to control high temps.
.
2. Seizure activity?/vegetative state: the patient was started
on dilantin originally as there was a question of seizure
because of vertical nystagmus, however this was stopped after 2
days as EEG was negative for seizure activity while nystagmus
continued. Vertical nystagmus likely secondary to pontine
hemorrhage with high fevers. CT head did not demonstrate acute
changes.
.
3. troponin elevation:  The patient had a mild bump in her
troponin to 0.1 but had a negative CK in the setting of no prior
cardiac hx. This was felt to be a nonspecific finding in the
setting of acute illness.
.
4. Nutrition - tube feeds at goal at time of discharge.
