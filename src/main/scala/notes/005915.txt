History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year-old man with high grade follicular lymphoma dx
in [**2105-6-26**] resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens,
now 8 days s/p R-CHop (first cycle) admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
sepsis.  He presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED complaining of fatigue,
shortness of breath, 1 day of chills, and abdominal fullness. He
was feeling more or less in his usual state of health when
presented to [**Hospital 478**] clinic on [**3-15**] for a count check.  He only
complained of fatigue and foot swelling. He was given an
additional lasix 20mg iv and kcl 20meq. He was also given a PRBC
transfusion via his PICC line
.
In ED  bp initially 100's but then to 60's-70's, non-rebreather
throughout in low to mid 90's, heart rate 90-110's.  He got 5
liters fluids, fem line placed, started on two
pressors-levophed, neosynephrine, given cefipime, vancomycin,
ambisome.  Pan-cultured, PICC line d/ced and sent for culture.
Chest CTA showed multi-focal pneumonia.  Patient asked not to be
intubated unless tehre was no other option.

Past Medical History:
1. High grade follicular lymphoma: He was diagnosed with a high-

grade lymphoma in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year when he presented with night

sweats, diffuse bone pain, and bulky diffuse adenopathy. He was
initially treated with CHOP to which he initially had a good
response. He has also been treated with R-[**Hospital1 **], and ICE. He has

had numerous neurological complications from his lymphoma. He
developed blurred vision, for which he responded well to
radiation therapy. He also developed a C3-5 mass that resulted
in left arm weakness such that he is unable to raise his arm. He
also has a medial nerve palsy and decreased sensation on the
left forearm. He underwent radiation therapy to the C3-5 lesion
with no effect.
He is now undergoing R-CHOP-day #8 of cycle 1
2. Melanoma-in-situ on left foot: Resected in [**2099**], no evidence
of recurrence on [**2100**] biopsy.
3. Hypertension.
4. hx of prostatitis
5. Neuropathy secondary to vincristine
6. Recent hospitalization for MRSA high grade bacteremia from
port-a-cath
7. More recent hospitalization (d/c on [**2106-2-18**]) for chord
compression-radiation and high dose steroids.
8. Focal dorsal epidural mass centered at T9-10 levels with
extension through the neural foramen, with a moderate degree of
cord compression


Social History:
He lives in [**Location 23962**], is married, and has two children. He is
a math professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15559**]. He is a non-smoker and
used to drink 2 wine with dinner but has stopped once he was
diagnosed with lymphoma.


Family History:
There is no history of cancer in his immediate family. He has
three healthy siblings.

Pertinent Results:
Microbiology:
[**3-17**] Urine culture: no growth.
[**3-17**] Blood culture: [**3-30**] blood cultures positive for oxacillin
resistant staph aureus.
[**3-17**] R PICC catheter tip culture: no growth.
[**3-18**], [**3-19**] Blood culture: pending.
All subsequent blood and urine cultures were negative.

Images:
[**3-17**] CT
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal areas of consolidation in the lungs, worrisome for
multifocal pneumonia.
3. Numerous foci of presumed lymphomatous disease involving both
axilla, the kidney, the retroperitoneum, and the osseous
structures.
...........................................

[**2106-3-19**]
CXR
FINDINGS: The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. There are new heterogenous opacities in
both lower lobes indicative of pneumonia. Upper lung fields are
clear. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia/aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68 year-old man with high grade follicular lymphoma dx
9 months ago s/p multiple chemotherapeutic regimens currently
day #8 of cycle 1 R-CHOP, known epidural mets-thoracic chord
compression, pancytopenic, on levoquin, fluconazole, acyclovir
prophylaxis admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] septic, likely secondary to
multi-focal pneumonia.
.
# MRSA Sepsis: Likely source of bacteremia leading to sepsis was
pneumonia vs. PICC line infection.   Patient was treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics including cefipime, vanc, ambisome
(changed to cefepime), and flagyl.  Aggressive ivf's and
pressors needed to maintain BP.  Patient recovered from sepsis
and was transferred to BMT floor where broad spectrum
antibiotics were continued.  Fevers resolved and patient was
tapered off all antibiotics (finished 14 day course of
vancomycin).
.
# PNA - Felt to have PNA by CXR. Once above antibiotics were
tapered off, patient was started on levofloxacin for presumed
PNA.  Had continuous 02 requirement, low grade.
.
# HEME/ONC: Patient recieved r-chop as above, but had extremely
poor prognosis.  He was given decadron for chord involvement (no
new acute sxs during this admission) as well as frequent
transfusions for anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**]
followed the patient, and repeated discussions were had with the
patient and the family regarding the poor overall prognosis of
the patient.  D/T the aggressive nature of his follicular
lymphoma and his multiple comorbidities and concommitant medical
problems, the patient was made DNR/DNI and shortly thereafter
the family moved to CMO.  The patient was started on morphine
for comfort and passed away approximately 48hrs after from
respiratory depression.
