Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91946**] is a 76 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, DM, HTN, CKD
(baseline Cr ~3), CHF with EF 45%, PVD with chronic right 3rd
toe ulceration, s/p bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, who
is being transferred from OSH for shortness of breath, found to
have pneumonia and CHF exacerbation. Patient was recently
discharged from [**Hospital3 **] to rehab (Newbridge on the
[**Doctor Last Name **]) after admission for falls and uncontrolled diabetes.
Prior to that he had been living independently at home. During
hospitalization at Sturdy, his ACE inhibitor and Bumex were
stopped due to worsening renal function. While in rehab, he
subsequently developed respiratory distress and hypoxia to 82%
on RA. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], where he was found to
have worsening respiratory failure possibly due to pneumonia or
CHF. CXR showed likely multifocal BL pneumonia, +/- pulmonary
edema. Echo showed LVEF 40%, moderately depressed LV systolic
function, hypokinesis/near-akinesis of at least basal and
mid-anteroseptal segments, moderate MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 16835**] negative (CPK
100, MB 2.3, Trop T 0.129 -> 0.138). EKG unremarkable. BNP
[**Numeric Identifier 91947**]. Lasix gtt @ 5cc/hr was started with good diuresis
(-1300cc on [**2-2**], -1500cc on [**2-3**]) but limited improvement in
oxygenation. Patient received dose of vanc/azithro/ceftriaxone
in [**Location (un) 620**] ED, then started on azithro and ceftriaxone as
inpatient. On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he is on 100% nonrebreather
satting in the 80s, antibiotics and Lasix gtt. He is currently
normotensive.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient is hemodynamically stable,
satting in low 90's on 100% NRB. He complains of "weakness" but
denies dyspnea.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Social History:
Prior to hospitalization and rehab, patient continued to work at
the Bay [**Location (un) 47997**] teaching appliance maintenance and
refrigeration. He has not smoked for more than 50 years. He
lives independently with his girlfriend.

.
CXR ([**2123-2-2**], [**Location (un) 620**]): The patient is status-post CABG and
median sternotomy wires are intact. There is diffuse air space
opacity overlying the right hemithorax and portions of the left
hemithorax with sparing of the left lung apex and upper lobe.
The opacity obscures the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is
no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: BILATERAL AIR SPACE OPACITIES, WORSE ON THE RIGHT.
IN THE PROPER CLINICAL SCENARIO, THESE ARE CONSISTENT WITH
MULTIFOCAL PNEUMONIA. LESS LIKELY, THIS WOULD REPRESENT
PULMONARY EDEMA.
.
CXR ([**2123-2-3**]): bilateral pulmonary edema and possible bilateral
infiltrates, pleural effusion on left.
.
EKG ([**2123-2-2**], [**Location (un) 620**]): NSR at a rate of 74 beats per minute,
normal axis, QTC of 495, minimal ST depression in V5 alone.
.
EKG ([**2123-2-3**]): ST depressions V4-V6
.
ECHO ([**2123-2-3**], [**Location (un) 620**]): [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated. RA moderately
dilated. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild/moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
and mid anteroseptal segments. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, additonal focal wall motion abnormalities cannot be
fully excluded. Overall LV systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 40 %). There is abnormal septal
motion/position. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Normal left ventricular cavity
size and wall thickness with moderately depressed left
ventricular systolic function and hypokinesis/near-akinesis of
at least the basal and mid anteroseptal segments. Right
ventricle not well-visualized. Well-seated, normally functioning
bioprosthetic aortic valve. At least moderate mitral
regurgitation in the setting of severe mitral annular
calcification. Mild pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
.
EEG ([**2123-2-11**]):
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG because
of
frequent bursts of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges
at 1-1.5
Hz in the beginning of the recording which became prolonged
induration
by the afternoon. These do not have any clinical correlation. In

between bursts of GPEDs, the background remains slow and
disorganized at
a maximum of 5 Hz posteriorly indicative of moderate diffuse
encephalopathy. During the recording, frequent right arm and leg

writhing movements that are sometimes generalized are seen,
associated
with grunting at times, and do not have any electrographic
correlate or
clear association with GPEDs. No clear electrographic seizures
are
present in this recording. Compared to the previous day, there
is no
significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:  76 yo M with h/o CABG, DM,
HTN, CKD (baseline Cr ~3), systolic CHF with EF 40-45% who is
being transferred from OSH for shortness of breath, found to
have pneumonia and CHF exacerbation thought to be due to
pneumonia and cessation of Lasix.
