Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and central venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 75257**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a medical history
notable for dementia on hospice care She presented from home
with a 1 week history of poor oral intake and shortness of
breath since midnight (per report from her daughter). EMS
reportedly had difficulty obtaining a heart rate and blood
pressure on arrival to her home. She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
without intervention.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial vital signs were: Rectal
temp 101.8, HR 101, BP 62/38, and no O2 sat was able to be
obtained despite being on a non-rebreather. She was noted to be
mottled on arrival. EKG showed deep TWI anteriorly and laterally
in the setting of tachycardia and hypotension, concerning for
ischemia. An intraosseus line was placed in her right tibia for
access. Vancomycin and Zosyn were started and she was switched
from phenylephrine to levophed for BP support. She was then
intubated for respiratory support (complicated by initial right
mainstem bronchus). A NG tube was placed and drained 10cc of
dark brown fluid. A Foley catheter was placed, and UA was
grossly positive draining very cloudy urine. Lactate was
elevated to 4.2, Trop was elevated to 0.28 with flat CK and MB.
She was also noted to be hypernatremic to 170. Patient recieved
total of 5L NS in the ED. Cardiology was notified of elevated
troponin and EKG changes and felt that no heparin gtt was
indicated in setting of likely demand ischemia. She was given an
aspirin. CT-A Torso showed RLL opacity, concernin for an
aspiration event but there was no pulmonary embolus. She was
then transferred to the ICU.

In the ICU she was treated for sepsis (presumed sources were
urine and possible pneumonia) with IV fluids, presors, and
Vancomycin and Zosyn (this was later switched to Unasyn on
[**2125-5-17**]). Other active issues included acute renal failure, a
2-unit GI bleed of unclear origin, and severe constipation. She
was successfully extubated on [**5-17**] and pressors were turned off
on [**5-18**].

Of note, due to her dementia she was minimally verbal but was
able to ambulate until [**9-/2124**] when she broke her hip. She was
then in Rehab for 2 months. Since [**1-/2125**], she has been bedbound,
sometimes transfered to wheelchair by family members. Since this
time, her geriatrician convinced the family to place her on
Hospice for increased services at home, though the patient
continued to be Full Code as part of the Hospice agreement. She
is usually taken to [**Hospital1 2177**] for all hospitalizations, but she was
too unstable this time. Per daughter, she is able to answer
simple yes/no questions at baseline and was able to speak in
short 5-word sentences up to two weeks ago. She lives with her
son, though the daughter/HCP lives nearby and sees her often.
Daughter reports that patient had some poor po intake a few
weeks ago, decreased appetite for a couple of days, then
diarrhea for a week. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for a couple of
days for right hand and left leg edema noted by visiting nurse;
during this hospitalization, ultrasounds ruled out blood clots.

Past Medical History:
dementia
arthritis
recurrent syncope
Hip Repair [**9-/2124**]

Social History:
Lives with son, Daughter [**Name (NI) 54855**] nearby is HCP and sees her
often.  Daughter is social worker.  [**Name (NI) **] has been bedbound
since [**1-/2125**], after difficult recovery from Left Hip repair in
9/[**2124**].

distress, cachectic

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-5-15**] 2:40 AM
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities or interval
change.

[**2125-5-15**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat. Left axis
deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block. Diffuse
T wave abnormalities - cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing  of [**2124-9-21**]
diffuse T wave abnormalities are now present.

[**2125-5-15**] CXR:
Satisfactory NG tube position. Probable right mainstem
intubation. Recommend repeat radiograph with all tubing removed
from the
front of the chest to better evaluate. Left basilar atelectasis
but otherwise no acute findings.

[**2125-5-15**] CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:
1. Right mainstem intubation with extensive atelectasis or
aspiration in the left lower lobe. Multifocal opacities in the
right lower lobe concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
2. No pulmonary embolism, but this study is not suited for
evaluation for
pulmonary embolism as no contrast was given.
3. Severe fecal impaction in the rectum without bowel
obstruction.
4. 6-mm nonobstructive calculi in the lower pole of the left
kidney.
Moderate right renal pelvic dilation due to UPJ obstruction as
the distal
ureter is not dilated.
5. Severe coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic disease.
4.6 cm
ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm.

CXR [**2125-5-23**]: Left central venous line tip is most likely in the
azygos vein. There is new bilateral pleural effusion, moderate
to large with bibasilar, left more than right consolidations.
Findings might be consistent with massive aspiration or
infection. No evidence of edema is noted. No pneumothorax is
seen.
