History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 49695**] is a 87 yo F with h/o afib on coumadin, CHF, and
asthma, who presents following an unwitnessed fall at home from
her chair at 6 a.m. this morning. Per her husband's report, he
heard her calling for help from the kitchen and found her lying
on the floor. He states that she was responsive and
communicative at the time and denied any bladder or bowel
incontinence. He called EMS, and she was transported to [**Hospital **]
Hospital. Stat CT head revealed smal acute subdural hematoma
within the interhemispheric fissure adjacent to an acute corpus
callosum hematoma. She received 1 unit FFP, Vitamin K 10 mg x1,
and 20 meq of KCL at OSH. CT c-spine and pelvic x-ray were
negative. She was found to have a troponin leak of 0.1 with MBI
6.6 at OSH and an EKG with nonspecific ST deviations in the
precordial leads. UA was negative.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], T 98.5, HR 66, BP 108/50, SpO2 95% on 4L
NC. She complained of right hip pain and denied headache or
chest pain. She received 2 additional units of FFP, Vitamin K
5mg SC, Profilnine 4 vials IV, Lasix 40 mg IV, and 20 meq KCl.
ABG was 7.53/50/266. Stat head CT was performed which confirmed
small SDH. Neurosurgery and Neurology were consulted.

STUDIES:
=========
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2101-5-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema with new moderate
bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Right middle and lower lobe opacities appear more confluent
with worsening of retrocardiac consolidation could reflect
worsening atelectasis and/or interval aspiration.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-5-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No interval change in the small-moderate subdural hematoma
with adjacent intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal
lobe.
2. Hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe, chronicity of
which is unknown, and may reflect an area of encephalomalacia
from prior infarct. HOWEVER, COMPARISONW ITH PRIOR STUDIES IS
ESSENTIAL FOR BETTER ASSESSMENT AND TO EXCLUDE ACUTE ETIOLOGY.

HIP (UNILAT 2 VIEW) W/PELVIS (1 VIEW)  [**2101-5-25**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-5-25**]
HEAD CT W/O IV CONTRAST: Adjacent to the left falx, there is a
small subdural hematoma superior to the corpus callosum. There
is also an adjacent parenchymal hematoma measuring 3.1 cm (AP) x
2.3 cm (transverse) x 1.8 cm (CC). There is surrounding
vasogenic edema with mild effacement of the sulci. There is no
midline shift. A several centimeter area of hypoattenuation in
the right frontal lobe (2:21) is consistent with
encephalomalacia due to prior infarction, although comparison to
more remote studies is recommended to exclude an underlying
mass. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in size and
configuration. There is no fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left subdural hematoma and adjacent intraparenchymal
hemorrhage related to fall. Resulting vasogenic edema and
effacement of the sulci with no midline shift.
2. Right frontal low density focus consistent with
encephalomalacia, but comparison to older (outside) studies is
recommended to exclude an underlying mass.

[**5-25**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation. Ventricular premature beats. Left axis
deviation which may be left anterior fascicular block and
consider also possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
ST-T wave abnormalities. The QTc interval appears prolonged but
is difficult to measure. Findings are non-specific but clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
TRACING #1

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-5-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Small subdural hematoma and left frontal intraparenchymal
hematoma unchanged with mild sulcal effacement. Small focus of
hyperattenuation along the right superior frontal convexity may
represent a small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage; this is also
unchanged from prior exams.

2. Hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe which is again of
uncertain chronicity, is likely to reflect an area of
encephalomalacic change from prior infarct. However, comparison
with prior study or MRI is recommended to exclude an acute
process.

slow and disorganized, typically reaching a 6 Hz maximum in most
areas.
