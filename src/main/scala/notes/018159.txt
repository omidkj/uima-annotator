History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89956**] is a 61-year-old gentleman, with a past medical
history of Ph+ ALL in remission s/p chemotherapy (DVA, Gleevec)
and s/p MUD myeloablative all-BMT [**2132-7-9**] (today D+209) c/b GVHD
of the liver, CMV viremia, R leg Zygomycetes infection treated

+209 post-transplant, being admitted with acute onset fever,
cough and URI symptoms for the past 2-3 days.  While upper
respiratory symptoms began three days ago, patient first noted
fever of 100.2 this morning.  Patient has had malaise, aches,
vomiting and cough productive of white sputum sputum as well.
He notes diarrhea, two bowel movements per day, for the past
three days, and episodes of vomiting when he takes his pills

decreased oral intake.  He also notes headaches, responsive to
Tylenol, without any visual changes or neck stiffness.  He
denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, neck stiffness,
changes in vision, hematuria, dysuria, hematochezia, hematemesis
or new rashes.  He notes that the infection on his left leg is
improving.  Of note, his wife has been sick at home with an ear
infection and cough.  On [**Holiday **], the patient visited with his
five grandchildren, aged 10, 9, 7, 2 and 1.  Also of note, on
[**1-31**] AFB grew out from BAL a months ago, but is still
speciating; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] thinks this may be [**Doctor First Name **].
.
In clinic today, the paitent was febrile to 102.1.  He received
meropenem and micafungin.  On arrival to the floor, the patient
was feeling alright, but tired.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
He originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED with dyspnea on
exertion and lower extremity edema. Labs showed him to be anemic
with a Hgb of 7.1 and Hct of 21 and thrombocytopenic with a
platelet count of 13,000. His white count was normal at 6.3 but
he had 11% bands in his differential. A bone marrow biopsy was
performed and per OSH records pathology was consistent with
acute leukemia, although no Heme/Path reports were sent. Mr.
[**Known lastname 89956**] was then transferred on [**2132-3-20**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy was done on [**2132-3-21**], pathology was
consistent with ALL. Cytogenetics showed the presence of BCR-ABL
gene rearrangement in 90/100 cells. He was started on Hyper
C-VAD part A on [**2132-3-22**], which was complicated by tumor lysis
syndrome and low-grade DIC. He was also started on Gleevec.
During his nadir on [**2132-3-29**] he spiked a fever and was started on
Cefepime and vancomycin. Blood cultures from that day returned
with 2/4 bottles positive for MRSA. His PICC was therefore
pulled on [**3-31**] and the tip was sent for culture, which came back
negative. An echo showed no signs of vegetation, and a
replacement PICC was placed after 48 hours of remaining
afebrile. Several days later he spiked fevers again and was
noted to have infiltrates on CT suggestive of multi-focal
pneumonia, a subsequent bronch with BAL demonstrated MRSA.
Repeat echo again did not show any evidence of vegetations. He
was discharged home on [**2132-4-18**] with his PICC line to continue IV
vancomycin for 3 weeks (end [**5-1**]). Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 89957**]
creatinine began to rise from a baseline of 0.7-0.9to a max of
2.4 on [**2132-4-15**]. This was felt to be secondary to an episode of
relative hypotension coupled with toxic levels of vancomycin.
Vanco was held and then renally dosed, after which he had only a
slight improvement in his creatinine. A bone marrow biopsy on
day +23 of his treatment showed no evidence of leukemia and
normal cytogenetics indicative of remission.
.
After his discharge on [**2132-4-18**], he was re-admitted on [**2132-4-22**]
with a diffuse rash and a RUE DVT at his PICC. The rash was
thought to be due either to nifedipine, which was started during
his prior admission for hypertension, or vancomycin, although
this was thought to be less likely because he did not
havedesquamation. Instead of completing a 3 week course of
vancomycin, this drug was stopped after approximately 2 weeks
due to development of his rash as per ID recommendations, and he
was discharged on [**2132-4-25**] off antibiotics. An ultrasound of his
right arm prior to discharge showed resolution of the previously
noted DVT.
.
He was re-admitted on [**2132-5-5**] for fatigue, new cough, and a
elevated white blood cell count of 14.0. He was subsequently
discharged on [**2132-5-7**] after receiving IV fluids and starting on a
course of po linezolid. During this admission his Gleevec dosage
was increased from 300 mg daily to 400 mg daily. An LP with
prophylactic IT methotrexate administration was also attempted
during hospitalization but was unsuccessful. Ultimately he ended
up having 4 weekly doses of prophylactic IT methotrexate given
locally by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his last dose was on [**2132-6-17**].
.
He was admitted for his transplant on [**2132-7-3**], day 0 was [**2132-7-9**].
His post-transplant course has been complicated by MRSA
bacteremia, acute kidney injury d/t tacrolimus toxicity (was
accidentally given 10 mg of tacro versus 1 mg), urinary BK
virus, and CMV viremia requiring therapy with Foscarnet. See
dischargesummaries in OMR for details regarding these
admissions.
.
On day +98 he was re-admitted with sudden onset RUQ abdominal
pain and fever. An ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge without
cholecystitis and an ERCP was performed revealing blocked common
bile duct. A sphincterotomy was performed with extraction of
sludge, stone fragments, and a small amount of pus.His total
bilirubin was elevated to 10.3 several days s/p ERCP with
stenting. A repeat ERCP and MRCP showed no residual biliary
obstruction. A liver biopsy was then performed which showed a
mixed picture of GVHD infectious cholangitis. He was started on
steroids for GVHD and his total bili had decreased to 2.5
upondischarge on [**2132-10-26**].
.
In [**2132-11-1**], pulmonary nodules noted on CT scan, and
aspergillus in sputum.  In [**Month (only) **], patient was readmitted with
right leg mucor infection.  At which point, he started treatment
with ambisome and micafungin, which were continued as an
outpatient, with treatment course complicated by PICC line
thrombus.
