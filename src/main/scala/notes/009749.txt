Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
Anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy [**2162-1-10**], [**2162-1-15**]

History of Present Illness:
Primary Care Physician: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

Chief Complaint: Anemia

History of Present Illness / ICU course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old Russian-speaking male with remote history of
duodenal ulcer, prostate cancer, and recent GI bleed secondary
to gastric ulcers who presents from rehab with lethargy and
anemia. The patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) **] after
presenting with malaise and lethargy, and found to have a HCT of
17. He underwent an initial EGD on [**1-5**], which revealed blood
in the fundus without evidence of active bleeding. The patient
was intubated for this procedure given evidence of aortic
stenosis on physical exam. EGD was repeated on [**1-6**] and
revealed 2 gastric cardia ulcers with a visible vessel. The
ulcers were injected with epinephrine and 2 clips were applied.
At the time of discharge, the patient's HCT was 24.2 after a
total of 4U PRBCs.

Since discharge, per son, patient has been doing fine. On the
day of admission, he was more lethargic. He had no vomiting, no
bright red blood per rectum, and denied lightheadedness, chest
pain or shortness of breath.

In the ED inital vitals were, 98.4 75 84/39 20 99%RA. Labs were
significant for HCT 20 (24.2 at discharge on [**1-9**]), INR 1.1,
WBC 13.8. NG lavage was positive for bright red blood then dark
clotted material after 1 liter. He was given levofloxacin for
concern of HCAP based on CXR. He also received metoclopramide
and pantoprazole. Patient received 250 cc IVF with improvement
of SBP to low 100s. He had 2 X 18G PIVs placed and received 1
unit PRBC.

ICU course [**Date range (1) 75505**]:
On arrival to the ICU, VS were T 98.4, HR 76, BP 125/62, RR 16
O2 100% on RA. Patient was lethargic but responsive to
questions. He reported mild epigastric pain, no shortness of
breath and no chest pain.

Patient was given an additional 2 units PRBC in ICU. He had a
repeat upper endoscopy on [**1-11**] that showed a diverticulum with
clot at the fundus without any evidence of a clear source.
Surgical options were discussed with the patient and his family
which they are not interested in pursuing at this time given
relative clinical stability.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood culture [**2162-1-10**] - PENDING
H.pylori antibody [**2162-1-10**] - Negative
MRSA screen [**2162-1-11**] - Negative

IMAGING:

ECG [**2162-1-10**]: Probable ectopic atrial rhythm. Left axis
deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block. Right
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2162-1-4**] the rate is slower.

CXR [**2162-1-10**]:
The lung volumes have decreased, with increasing areas of
atelectasis at both left and right lung bases. No pleural
effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No
pulmonary edema.

CXR [**2162-1-10**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
intubated. The lung volumes have decreased, with increasing
areas of
atelectasis at both left and right lung bases. No pleural
effusions.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema.
The nasogastric tube is in unchanged position.

CTA ABD/PELVIS [**2162-1-10**]:
1. Surgical clips within the gastric fundus from prior
endoscopy. No signs of active GI bleeding.
2. Left-sided non-obstructive nephrolithiasis with the largest
calculus measuring 7 x 13 mm in the left renal pelvis.
3. Multiple renal cysts
4. Sigmoid redundancy and diverticulosis without signs of acute
diverticulitis or active bleeding.
5. Accessory right renal artery.
6. Stable compression deformity of the L2 vertebral body causing
moderate canal stenosis at this level.

EGD [**2162-1-10**]:
Diverticulum in the fundus
Blood in the stomach
Previously placed clips in the stomach
There was no blood in the duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

EGD [**2162-1-15**]:
Impression: Some small amount of coffee ground was initially
seen in the fundus. Three clips were seen in the fundus. A
gastric diverticulum was noted in the fundus 7mm in diameter.
Fresh red blood was noted halfway through the procedure. An area
of active bleeding was seen in the cardia consistent with a
dieulafoy lesion. 1cc of 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] epinephrine was injected in two
quadrants for hemostasis prior to endoclip placement. (endoclip,
injection)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

CXR [**2162-1-11**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has

been removed. The lung volumes are slightly lower than on the
previous image, with bilateral areas of basal atelectasis. There
is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, so that the
presence of a minimal pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No
evidence of pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged borderline
size of the cardiac silhouette.

TTE [**2162-1-12**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is basal septal
hypertrophy. There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilat
