Imaging:
Head CT [**11-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable size of left-sided subdural hematoma.
Hyperdensity seen
within this collection is most likely due to resolving blood
products in the
setting of stable hematoma size. However, increase in shift of
midline
structures to the right when compared to [**10-21**] study but
improved when
compared to [**10-20**] study. No new acute intracranial
hemorrhage seen.

Head CT [**11-2**](post-op):
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval partial evacuation of a left subdural hematoma, and
placement of a catheter into the left extra-axial space.
2. Residual subdural hematoma overlying the left cerebral
convexity
posteriorly, with rightward subfalcine herniation of 6 mm.

EKG [**11-1**]:
Sinus rhythm with one atrial premature beat. Voltage criteria
for left
ventricular hypertrophy. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities
consistent with
left ventricular hypertrophy but cannot exclude ischemia.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2174-10-21**] rhythm is now sinus and voltage has
increased.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T
78	154	100	420/451	31	42	-62

CXR [**11-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild fluid overload with bilateral pleural
effusions.

Cardiac ECHO [**11-4**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

UE US [**11-4**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.

EKG [**11-4**]:
Atrial fibrillation with mean ventricular rate 97. Diffuse
non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2174-11-1**]
multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU and monitored closely. She had a
repeat Ct here that showed enlarged subdural and after
discussion with family who preferred surgical intervention she
was brought to the Or where under general anesthesia she
underwent left craniotomy with evacuation SDH.  She tolerated
this procedure well and was monitored closely post op in PACU.
Post op CT showed improvement. Pt's neurological exam continued
to be poor. She had blood transfusions for low hematocrit.
Discussions with pt's daughter [**Name (NI) 96960**], she confirmed DNR/DNI
status but she did wish to proceed with feeding tube.  On [**11-7**]
PEG was placed without difficulty.  In the early morning [**11-9**],
she became fluid overloaded and recieved lasix with good
diuresis. Later that morning, while daughter was present, her
SBP, HR and RR slowly declined.  She expired peacefully at
11:15am. Daughter did not want autopsy due to religious
preference.
