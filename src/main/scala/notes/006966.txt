History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M presents with several days of increased DOE and fatigue
(started [**8-15**]). He lives alone is normally fully independent.
Daughter notes gradual and severe worsening in his symptoms. Pt
with severe aortic stenosis, s/p recent valvuloplasty. Pt denies
chest pain. Family and patient noted increased LE edema over
this time frame.  Pt hasn't slept well.  SOB worse with
exertion.  Has had episodes like this before but never this bad.


No cough, confusion, dysuria, abdominal pain, change in bowel or
bladder habits.  No recent weight gain.  As per patient, he
weighs himself every day, and he actually lost pound and a half
in past day.  He hasn't slept well recently due to SOB.  Not on
O2 at home.  No positional change in SOB.  Pt denies fever,
change in speech, focal weakness, sick contacts.  His legs have
never been this swollen before.  He takes torsemide and has been
taking it regularly.

In the ED, 99.6 HR: 50 BP: 93/55 Resp: 28 O(2)Sat: 99.
Consulted cards, who did not think this was c/w cardiogenic
shock, based on patient being warm.  ED thought cardiogenic
shock, but treated with fluids 300cc when patient had falling
SBPs, to as low as 73.  They started RIJ and norepinephrine
pressor.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was mentating well, but did
report feeling SOB.

CXR [**2117-8-18**]:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged. New right lower
lobe opacity is concerning for pnuemonia. Additional hazy
bibasilar opacities obscuring the costophrenic angles are likely
again due to a combination of atelectasis as well as effusions.
Mild vascular congestion is present in both lungs. Osseous and
soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1) New right lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia.
2) Small effusions and mild congestion.
.
EKG [**2117-8-18**]:  sinus arrhythmia, LAD/LVH, ST depression V5/V6,
new T-wave inversion V4/V5

ECHO: [**2117-8-20**]:
"The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Critical aortic valve stenosis. Left ventricular
cavity enlargement with severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse
process. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Increased PCWP. Dilated aortic sinus.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-7-15**],
the gradient across the aortic valve is lower, but critical
aortic stenosis persists.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis. Based on [**2111**]
ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is
symptomatic (angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate,
surgical intervention has been shown to improve survival."
