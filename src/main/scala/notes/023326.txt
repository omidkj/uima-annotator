Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old male
with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, CHF with an ejection fraction of 15% and ICD for
DF/VT.  Here for possible ICD malfunction after he was
shocked three times at home the night before admission to an
outside hospital.  The first shock occurred on the morning
prior to admission with no preceding symptoms.  The second
shock occurred while walking downstairs, and he reported
reaching out his arm.  Third shock occurred shortly after
this when he was reaching out with his left hand, and the
final and fourth shock occurred when he was reaching out in
bed with his left arm and received multiple shocks in a row.

At the outside hospital, the patient had a magnet placed over
his ICD, and was given magnesium sulfate.  He was
hemodynamically stable, and had no complaints otherwise.

On review of symptoms, the patient reported occasional
orthostatic hypotension, but denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient denies fever or
chills.  Denied bloody stools or black stools.  The patient
denied orthopnea, PND, or dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. ICD for VF with second SVC coil because of high DFTs with
three-lead fracture in 03/99.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. CHF with an EF of 15%.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Obesity.
8. History of unsuccessful VT ablation.
9. Osteoarthritis.
10. BPH.
11. Reactive airway disease.
12. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol 50 b.i.d.
2. Vasotec 10 b.i.d.
3. Lasix 40 b.i.d.
4. Imdur 60 q.d.
5. Lanoxin 125 mcg.
6. Levoxyl 125 mcg.
7. Lipitor 40.
8. Plavix 75.
9. Spironolactone 25.
10. Dofetilide 250 q.d.
11. Coumadin 10 two days a week, 7.5 five days a week.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient reports coronary artery disease in
his father.  [**Name (NI) **] also has a 50 pack year smoking history, but
quit 34 years ago.  He denies alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish and IV dye, which causes hives, and
amiodarone which caused edema.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate of
80, blood pressure 86/52, respiratory rate 16.  Saturating
97% on room air.  Patient was alert and oriented times three
in no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.  There was
no JVD and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular reveals
regular, rate, and rhythm with occasional irregular beats.
Faint systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Respiratory:  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac rhythm:  Patient is admitted with multiple shocks
from his ICD.  The shocks had occurred when the patient was
using his left arm predominantly.  This is likely due to the
fact that there was a device malfunction.  The device was
interrogated, and found to be oversensing noise from certain
arm movements.  The device was turned off and programmed DDD.
The INR was 2.5, so the patient was given vitamin K with plan
for future need revision.

Overnight the patient had a four-second pause on telemetry,
although the patient was asymptomatic.  The patient returned
to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a pacing catheter
placed.  The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2126-5-7**] for further monitoring in the setting of transvenous
pacing.  The patient remained comfortable and when his INR
trended down, he returned to the EP Laboratory for device
revision and lead revision.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well.

After this, the patient returned to the [**Hospital3 **]
floors and received multiple shocks on the morning, which
were appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's
pacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well.
It was reprogrammed to over pace out of ventricular
tachycardia prior to shocking.  The patient had additional
episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were successfully
paced out of by his pacemaker.  Patient was started on
lidocaine drip given his significant ventricular tachycardia
and the episodes of VT diminished significantly.  The patient
was transitioned to mexiletine on the next day, and tolerated
this well.  The patient had no further episodes of
significant ventricular tachycardia.

2. Coronary artery disease:  The patient currently had no
symptoms.  He was continued on his Plavix, statin,
beta-blocker, and Imdur.  Patient was not admitted on an
aspirin, although he was given an aspirin during his
hospitalization given the fact that was Coumadin was held.
Plan for no aspirin on discharge with resuming his Coumadin
as per his prior home regimen.

3. Congestive heart failure:  Patient has an ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
An echocardiogram on this hospitalization again revealed an
ejection fraction of 15-20%.  While the patient was NPO
during episodes of this hospitalization, his Lasix and
aldactone was held; however, he was continued on his Lasix,
aldactone, digoxin, and ACE inhibitor.  Patient had no
evidence of congestive heart failure during this
hospitalization and he resumed his prior medications before
discharge.

4. Endocrine:  Patient with hypothyroidism:  The patient was
continued on his Levoxyl.  He was also maintained on a
regular insulin-sliding scale.  Blood sugars remained in
normal levels, and he did not require significant amounts of
insulin.

5. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency.
Remained stable throughout this hospitalization.

6. Heme:  Patient's INR was reversed with vitamin K, and the
patient was instructed to resume Coumadin dosing on the
evening following discharge.  The patient will follow up with
his cardiologist or primary care physician for further
monitoring of his INR and adjustment of his Coumadin dose.

7. ID:  The patient had a temperature greater than 101.5
following his pacemaker placement, and therefore was
continued on his cephalosporin, which was originally given
for prophylaxis.  The patient was transitioned to p.o.
antibiotics, plan for seven-day course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ICD firing.
2. ICD revision.
3. Ventricular tachycardia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Furosemide 40 b.i.d.
2. Spironolactone 25 q.d.
3. Plavix 75 q.d.
4. Atorvastatin 40 q.d.
5. Levothyroxine 125 mcg.
6. Digoxin 125 mcg q.d.
7. Mexiletine 150 p.o. b.i.d.
8. Isosorbide mononitrate 30 q.d.
9. Enalapril 2.5 q.d.

14. Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow up with his primary
care physician in the week following discharge.  In addition
to this, the patient will follow up with the
electrophysiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**6-7**] in addition
to his appointment in Device Clinic on [**5-29**].
