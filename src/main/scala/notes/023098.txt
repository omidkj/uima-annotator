Imaging
.
ECG [**10-6**] - Atrial Fibrillation, nl axis and intervals, no
changes from prior
.
Radiology - CXR [**10-6**] - Cardiomegaly, left basilar opacity which
may be secondary to effusion or atelectasis. Lateral view may be
obtained to confirm.
.
CT CHEST - prelim - Biatrial enlargement. Left pleural effusion.

Multiple pulmonary nodules - f/u 1 year. Left adrenal gland
thickening. Left femoral hernia, nonobstructive. Rectal
thickening, likely chronic.
.
Multiple xrays c/w old fractures.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o F with PMH of diastolic CHF, dementia and
atrial fibrillation transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab after
sustaining an unwitnessed fall. Admitted to MICU for rapid
atrial fibrillation.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation - Pt with long standing history of atrial
fibrillation. Not medications at rehab. Cardizem and metoprolol
were used in attempt to decrease HR, but neither had a sustained
effect, and both caused drops in SBP. These meds were stopped
when patient was made CMO.
.
# S/P Fall - most likely mechanical fall but nonwitnessed. No
LOC reported. Head laceration was sutured. Sutures removed on HD
#5. Head CT neg for bleed.
.
# Chronic Renal Failure - Meds were renally doses until made
CMO, then all meds d/c'd, save Tylenol and morphine.
.
# Diastolic CHF - This was stable throughout hospitalization
with no clinical evidence of overload, despite elevated BNP.
.
# Hypothyroidism - Synthroid stopped when patient made CMO.
.
# Dementia - Ritalin stopped when patient was made CMO. She had
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. Alert and oriented x1 on
discharge.
.
# Code - DNR/DNI
.
# Dispo - To [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, per family meeting. Both daughters,

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen and treated for injuries you incurred after a
fall. Also, it was found that you had a urinary tract infection
that was treated with antibiotics. Your CT scan and xrays showed
evidence of old fractures, so no treatment is needed at this
time, except pain control.
.
All of your medications were stopped, as you do not need to be
bothered with them at this time. You will continue to receive
acetaminophen, per rectum, for pain and inflammation from your
fall. If you have breakthrough pain, you may receive morphine in
liquid form. No other medications, including oxygen, are
warranted.
.
You will be going to a facility that will help you to be
comfortable in a Hospice setting. You will not need to come back
to the hospital in the future.

Followup Instructions:
There is no need to arrange follow up with any health care
workers at this time, but you may call your PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **],[**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
