Studies:
CXR Pa/Lab ([**2103-6-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.

CXR [**2103-6-16**]:
Heart size top normal.  Pulmonary vasculature minimally
engorged, both
unchanged.  No pulmonary edema, atelectasis or pneumonia.
2.  Stable cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old woman with morbid obseity (BMI 60), schizophrenia,
HLD, HTN, reactive airway disease who presents with altered
mental status (decreased level of consciousness) cough,
shortness of breath and fatigue, consistent with COPD
exacerbation vs. asthma exacerbation leading to acute on chronic
hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Active Issues:

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Trigger thought to be asthma
vs COPD flare in the setting of presumed obesity hypoventilation
syndrome and OSA.  She has some pulmonary vascular congestion on
CXR, but no systolic heart failure on recent ECHO 3/[**2103**]. She
was placed on BiPAP, treated with nebs, steroids and
azithromycin.  Continued fluticasone inhaler. Also given 10mg IV
lasix x 2 with good effect.  On the floor she remained
asymptomatic with saturations in the mid-90's.   She will need
outpatient sleep study and PFTs.

# Schizophrenia: No active hallucinations, she says abilify
makes her less fatigued than geodon.  Likely her metabolic
syndrome has been worsened by these atypical antipsychotic
medications. Was continued on Abilify 10 mg daily.

# Hypertension: continued hydrochlorothiazide but decreased dose
to 25mg.
