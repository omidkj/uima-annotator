she diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Ampicillin was started
for a positive urinalysis.  It was discontinued when the culture
revealed no growth, and follow up urinalysis was negative.  Also
on this day she was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol. She progressed well during
post-op period and worked with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful.
On post-op day 5 she appeared suitable for discharge to rehab.
Appropriate medications and arrangements for follow-up
