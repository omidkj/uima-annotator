Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20816**],
.
Thank you for coming to [**Hospital1 18**] for your medical care. You were
admitted to the hopital for shortness of breath that we believe
is from a flare of your COPD. You were initially admitted to the
meidcal intensive care unit (MICU) because a machine called
BiPAP was being used to help you breath. When you were off this
machine and your breathing was more stable, you were transferred
to the medical floor. You recieved a course of antibiotics and
steroids. Your breathing has improved, but you are still
requiring some extra oxygen to help your breathing. You will be
going to a rehab facility until your breathing is back to usual.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
- Please START taking prednisone 60 mg daily for 1 more day
(last day [**2124-11-21**]).
- We would like
