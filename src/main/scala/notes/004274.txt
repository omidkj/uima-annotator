History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 88542**] is a 41F with history of alcoholism, HCV, who was
transferred from an outside hospital for management of
complicated pancreatitis. Patient was hospitalized from
[**Date range (3) 88543**] with acute hemorrhagic alcoholic
pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, upper GI bleed, E.coli
bacteremia from ascending cholangitis, and acute renal failure.
After a prolonged ICU course, she was discharged to rehab in
good condition. Patient was recovering well until [**2192-10-11**] when
she developed abdominal pain with distension, fevers (max
101.2), and diarrhea. She denied nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
cough, and
dyspnea. She was admitted again started on IV
Vanco/Levaquin/Meropenem, all blood cultures were negative. She
was transfused 2 units for Hct of 25 which remained stable at 37
for the remainder of her stay. Patient continued to have low
grade fevers, abdominal pain, and significant distension. She
was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her intra-abdominal
collections. Her current complaints include abdominal and back
pain. She denies nausea, vomiting, and malaise. She has not
passed flatus in days but has had multiple daily episodes of

IMAGING:
[**10-22**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Interval decrease in size to organized
peripancreatic and retroperitoneal collections extending into
the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces with appropriate
positioning to indwelling bilateral pigtail drainage catheters.

2. Interval increase in size to simple left pleural effusion
with adjacent compression atelectasis. Slight interval increase
in amount of nonorganized intra-abdominal ascites. 3. No other
vascular or parenchymal complications of pancreatitis
identified.
[**10-23**] CXR: ET tube is in standard placement, left internal
jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein. Left PIC
catheter tip still in the low SVC. Nasogastric tube should be
advanced 4 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Left
lower lobe atelectasis unchanged. Lungs otherwise grossly clear.
Heart size normal. No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion
along the left lateral chest wall and apex is new.
[**10-25**] CXR: Interval increase in left pleural effusion and
atelectasis.
[**10-25**] KUB: No retained surgical sponges identified.
[**10-27**] CXR: Unchange from prior: Large left retrocardiac
atelectasis with a small left pleural effusion. basal
atelectasis on Rt
[**10-29**] CT torso: PRELIM - Unchanged left pleural effusion w/
assoc'd left lower lobe collapse. Small right pleural effusion.
2. Interval decrease in size of the peripancreatic,
retroperitoneal and
intraperitoneal fluid collections. Interval increase in the
amount of peritoneal enhancement
[**10-30**]: CXR- S/p L thoracentesis with pigtail catheter in L lung
base, without evidence of ptx. ETT, NGT in unchanged position
since 1 day ago; note side port of NGT is at the GE junction.
Decreased L pleural effusion since 9 hours ago. Bibasilar atx.
Post surgical changes of anterior abdomen redemonstrated
[**10-31**]: CXR: Little change from prior
[**11-1**]: CXR: retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis improved.
right basal atelectasis unchanged.
[**11-2**]: 1. Right PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. 2.
Improvement in right lower lung atelectasis. 3. Persistent
vascular engorgement.
[**11-4**]: 1. Lines and tubes as described. Clinical correlation
regarding the PICC line is requested as it overlies the right
atrium. If clinically indicated, this could be retracted
approximately 3 cm.
2. NG tube probably does not extend below the GE junction, with
side port in mid esophagus. Clinical correlation rega
