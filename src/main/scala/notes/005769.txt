Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 28 yo woman with mental retardation, reactive airway
disease, DM, and severe kyphscoliosis with restrictive lung
disease, who was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] and discharged on
[**3-9**] after a MICU stay s/p intubation found to have a pulmonary
embolus. Pt at that time presented to [**Hospital 58752**] Hospital with
several days of decreased POs and increased shortness of breath.
She also had 2 wks of abd pain and facial swelling and was
recently treated with amoxicillin after tooth extraction. During
the prior hospitalization, pt was noted to have acute
respiratory distress and was intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory failure, given abx for possible PNA and then found
to have a large embolus in her R. pulmonary artery for which a
heparin gtt and coumadin were started. Antibiotics were stopped
at that time given no evidence of PNA on chest x-ray. She was
easily extubated the next day without difficulty. She remained
HD stable throughout her MICU stay. Pt was also placed on an
insulin gtt for DKA per signout notes. It was felt pt's facial
swelling may be secondary to an amoxicillin reaction. Pt was
discharged earlier today with supratherapeutic INR of 4.6 (4.0
earlier in AM).

Pt represents ~2 hrs after discharge to [**Hospital3 1810**] ED
with ? seizure activity with description of grinding teeth and
jaw clenching lasting ~1 minute. Per mother who witnessed this
activity, she denies any tonic clonic movement, LOC, urinary
incontinence, LH, dizziness during this episode. She was not
post-ictal after this episode and was oriented x 3 per family.
Her initial FS was 160. Per her father, she had a similar
episode of this the evening prior to discharge. She was also
noted to have increased work of breathing and on exam was noted
to have decreased air movement. She was given combivent neb x 3
and solumedrol 50 IV x 1. She had a head CT at [**Hospital1 11900**] which was negative for hemorrhage or infarction
(verified with radiologist at [**Hospital3 1810**]). She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED as there were no ICU beds available at
[**Hospital3 1810**].

Here, pt was started on her nightly BiPAP settings and is still
awaiting chest CT to rule out further extension of her pulmonary
embolus.

MICU: Patient was admitted to MICU on nite of [**3-9**], as she
showed respiratory distress, ABG 7.37/71/73; CXR poor quality
but diffuse opacity.  receive nebs and solumedrol w/ good
effect.This episode most likely represent asthma exacerbation,
and not likely due to worsening of her PE.  Started on
continuous nebs but not intubated. Switched to q2 nebs and now
transitioned to q4 nebs.

Pertinent Results:
Blood cx ([**2164-3-12**]) NGTD
Urine S. coag neg ([**2164-3-11**]) >100,000, [**2164-3-14**]

Holter ([**2162-1-29**]): Frequent IVCD; frequent uniform PVC during
sleep (no further intervention per card)

R heart cath in [**2144**] c/w pulm HTN  [**2-29**] upper aiway obstruction
(30-46 mm)

ECHO: ([**3-29**])-poor quality; low R vent pressure; low/nl LVEF; no
LVH, no AR

ECHO: [**2164-3-2**]
1. LV cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
3. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears significantly depressed. The pulmonary
artery is anterior to the aorta, which suggests transposition
(what corrective surgery has been done is unclear). Clinical
correlation is suggested.

RUQ u/s ([**2164-3-13**]): Gallbladder not definitely identified on this
very limited examination. Extensive shadowing overlying the
expected site of the gallbladder fossa, probably overlying
colon, although a large gallstone cannot be excluded. If further
evaluation of the gallbladder is needed, a CT or MR might be
helpful.

Head CT ([**2164-3-15**]): no head bleed

EEG: results pending

A/P: 28 yo woman with mental retardation, reactive airway and
restrictive lung dz, here with continued respiratory distress as
well as ?seizure activity yesterday.
Transferred to MICU on [**3-9**] from floor for respiratory distress
most likely [**2-29**] asthma exacerbation and improved on continuous
nebs and IV steroids, now transioned to q4 nebs.

A/P: 28 yo woman with mental retardation, reactive airway and
restrictive lung dz, here with continued respiratory distress as
well as ?seizure activity yesterday.
Transferred to MICU on [**3-9**] from floor for respiratory distress
most likely [**2-29**] asthma exacerbation and improved on continuous
nebs and IV steroids, now being transioned to q4 nebs.

1. Resp distress: most likely asthma exacerbation; need to to
consider if extension of clot, but less likely given therapuetic
level during respiratory distress. Now still w/ coarse breath
sound and decreased air movement, but overall stable
-cont nebs q4 + prn
-change prednisone to 40 [**Hospital1 **] (slow taper)
-serevent d/c and advair and singulair started instead

2. Seizure activity - ?hx of seizure activity in the past as she
is on topiramate, but per mother that is for her psych
condition.  Sounds like [**Doctor Last Name 11332**] mal seizure activity per
description of her seizure. hx of MVA and episodes of seizure
like history (loss of BM, post-ictal since [**12-28**]). Evaluated by
neuro at [**Hospital **] hosp and originally scheduled for outpt EEG.
 If seizure, ppt by ?hypoxia [**2-29**] of DOE??. NO further event upon
admission. electrolytes stable and no metabolic cause for
seizures.
- Head CT ( from [**Hospital **] hosp) negative for hemorrhage given
increased INR
- f/u urine cx
- CXR negative for PNA
- EEG results no signs of seizure activity, but encephalopathy
most likely [**2-29**] mental retardation and ectopy from heart (pt
already has known history)
-head CT neg for bleed

3. Pulmonary Embolism- supratherapeutic INR on current dose of
coumadin. Will hold coumadin for tonight with goal INR [**3-1**]. -
likely secondary to coumadin dose same. Will hold coumadin for
now with goal INR [**3-1**].  Will need to monitor coumadin dosing
closely.INR subtherapeutic at 1.8 on [**3-16**].--will cont on lovenox
until INR therapeutic
-cont coumadin.

4. ?DOE-?right heart failure- given symptoms of DOE and lower
ext edema, right heart hypertrophy suggestive of chronic cor
pulmonale (likely longstanding  poorly managed sleep apnea,
poorly managed and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome-> pulm
hypertension-> RVH) and now worsened by recent PE. Now improved
lower ext edema.
-consult cardiology and per card  rec: continue to treat PE and
underlying pulm etiologies
-lasix 20 IV given

5. Psych-suicidal idea\tion
-continue respirdal and haldol 2.5 qid  prn
-continue sitter
-will d/w team re: SW need + antidepressant once med condition
stabilized

6. RUQ abd pain- ?gallstone/liver: RUQ u/s limited but cannot
exclude gallstone.? constipation. Persistent and worrisome. HIDA
scan negative.clinically improved.
-will monitor clinically

7. Reactive Airway disease- sev
