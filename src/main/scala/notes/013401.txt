Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
gentleman with a history of hydrocephalus with a couple of
revisions of ventriculoperitoneal shunt who was admitted on
[**2101-4-19**] with decreased mental status.  It was found the
patient's ventriculoperitoneal shunt was not working.  The
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further evaluation and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hydrocephalus.
2.  Pituitary microadenoma.
3.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sinus surgery.
2.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement plus revision.
3.  Status post appendectomy.
4.  Frontal sinus surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to
the Neurosurgery Service.  He underwent ventriculoperitoneal
shunt revision of his new shunt and valve placement.

1.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  Initially, after the operation, the
patient showed an improvement in mental status changes.
However, on [**2101-4-29**] the patient's mental status started
to deteriorate again, to the point where he became
unresponsive.  He had to be intubated and
transferred to the intensive Unit.  At the same time, the
patient's
white blood cell count decreased.  He spiked a fever.  He had
a computed tomography scan of the head which showed dilated
ventricles.  The patient's reservoir was accessed with [**Known firstname **]
pus expressed.  The VP shunt was externalized.

For the next four weeks the patient had multiple drain
revisions due to poor flow and clogging by cell debris.  All
changes were made on the right side with left side being
saved for potential ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in
the future.

The patient's mental status was depressed with localizing
bilaterally and withdrawing to pain; however, this level was
intermittently changing, mostly in correlation with well
functioning of ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  On [**2101-5-22**], the
patient's mental status was slightly
improving with eyes opening and spontaneous movement of all
extremities.  However, in the evening of that day, after his
tracheostomy was suctioned, the patient's blood pressure
increased to 190.  After that, he had bright red blood
showing up in his drain, and his pupils became nonreactive.
On examination, he was not moving extremities and was not
withdrawing from pain.  He did not have gag reflex.

He underwent an emergency head computed tomography scan which
showed very large hemorrhage in the left hemisphere with
midline shift
and herniation.
His repeat examination was the same.  The patient had two
apnea tests which were both showed no spontaneous respirations..

On [**2101-5-23**], after discussing with the patient 's family his
ventilator was disconnected the patient expired.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient's blood pressure was
somewhat labile throughout the whole stay in the hospital;
however, mostly staying in the 90 to 150 range,
intermittently requiring a Nipride drip and neosynephrine in
order
to meet blood pressure parameters.

On [**5-22**], after right hemispheric bleed, the patient's
blood pressure was low, requiring neosynephrine for blood pres
sure
support.

3.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient remained intubated for all that
time.  Intermittently, the patient was on continuous positive
airway pressure with pressure support; however, we were
unable to wean him off the ventilator because of his poor
mental status.  Given the chronicity of the problems, the
patient underwent a tracheostomy on [**2101-5-13**].

On [**2101-5-22**] and [**2101-5-23**] the patient had an apnea
test both of which he failed and expired upon withdrawing
ventilator support.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Once transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit, the patient had a nasogastric tube placed and was
started on tube feeds.  Also on [**2101-5-15**], the patient
had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement and
was continued on tube feeds per percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube.  Throughout his stay in the hospital, there
were no concerns or issues with gastrointestinal tract or
liver.

5.  RENAL:  The patient continued having good urinary output.
No renal issues.

6.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  In the beginning of the patient's
Intensive Care Unit stay, he developed signs of syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone with low
serum sodium.  However, it was corrected by fluid
restriction.  The patient was intermittently receiving doses
of dexamethasone to decrease his edema; otherwise,
unremarkable.

7.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Concurrently with the patient's
initial decompensation on [**2101-4-29**] he was found to have a
urinary tract infection.  Once the initial VP shunt was
accessed and drained, it was cultured which eventually grew
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pan-sensitive enterococcus.  The
patient was initially treated with vancomycin, gentamicin,
and ceftazidime; however, later on it was switched to
vancomycin and gentamicin.

Also, for a period of about two weeks, the patient was
receiving IT injections of gentamicin.  Approximately after
one week of initial antibiotic treatment, his urinary tract
infection cleared.  His cerebrospinal fluid had cleared also,
and the last three consecutive cultures were negative for
bacteria.

8.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient was seen by Physical
Therapy and Occupational Therapy.  He had no active issues.

Once it was evident the patient was taking a turn for the
worse on [**2101-5-22**], the patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **]
who arrived to be with the patient.  The situation and
prognosis were explained by both the primary team as well as
the Intensive Care Unit team.

The family changed the patient's status to do not
resuscitate/do not intubate and then eventually to comfort
measures only, and the patient expired after withdrawing
respiratory support.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Death.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient's body was released to
the family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Hydrocephalus; status post ventriculoperitoneal shunt
revision.
 2.  Status post ventricular drain placement.
 3.  Status post meningitis.
 4.  Status post ventriculitis.
 5.  Status post left cerebral hemisphere bleed.
 6.  Status post cerebral herniation.
 7.  Hypertension.
 8.  Failure to thrive.
 9.  Respiratory failure.
10.  Urinary tract infection.
