History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with stage IV small cell
lung cancer w/ metastatic disease to brain and liver s/p last
chemo [**9-19**] and radiation in [**2147-6-18**] presenting with profuse
diarrhea and shortness of breath, and fluid responsive
hypotension in the setting of large PE in right pulmonary artery
extending into segmental branches.  He reports going to ED for
profuse, "projectile" diarrhea.  Patient does have chronic
intermittent diarrhea, usually worsened with courses of
chemotherapy.  He does have occasional nausea and vomiting that
is usually associated with po intake. Patient has not been
tolerating po well for several weeks. He denies any dysphagia,
chest pain, fevers, cough, abdominal pain. Patient has not
noticed a significant change in his shortness of breath. He had
a PE in [**2146-10-18**] treated with lovenox for 2 months and then
developed high fevers associated with medication. Patient was
then switched to a 6 month course of Arixtra.

In the ED, initial VS were:  96.8 118 98/79 26 100% on 2L NC

ED course:
-Reportedly short of breath and speaking in short sentences.
-Heparin bolus followed by drip
-Hypotension to systolic of 90's was responsive to 2L NS.
-Levofloxacin 500mg x1
-pt on chronic steroids and hypotensive in triage: concern for
adrenal insufficiency; gave 100mg hydrocortisone IVx1

On arrival to the MICU: AF 116/75  HR 90  sat 99% on 2L NC
He denies any pain or change in his dyspnea.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
1. Small cell lung cancer, metastatic to liver and brain.
Followed by [**Year (4 digits) **] [**Year (4 digits) 40356**] with [**Hospital1 18**]. Last chemo was [**2147-9-19**]
and last radiation was [**2147-6-18**].
2. Dermatomyositis (paraneoplastic syndrome),
3. Hx of bronchitis
4. Hx L ankle fracture; other bone fractures
5. BPH
6. Pulmonary embolism [**10/2145**], cancer and IVIG related.
7. right 5th toe fracture ~[**2146-6-20**].

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2144-7-18**]: Presented with rash over forearms and torso.
[**2144-8-18**]: Later developed muscle weakness. Saw dermatologist, Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 16077**] - biopsy positive for dermatomyositis. Started on
prednisone 60 mg daily with good improvement of his rash and
weakness. He was also referred to a rheumatologist and
neurologist for further evaluation. Dysphagia symptoms also
apparent, evaluated by a speech and swallow therapist at [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2144-10-18**]: Radiographical workup - CT scanning showed a prominent
right hilar node and a lesion in the liver. Liver lesion by MRI
on [**2144-11-9**] at [**Hospital6 1109**] was equivocal.
[**2144-11-23**]: PETCT scan performed at [**Hospital1 **] showed abnormal
uptake in the right paratracheal lymph node, right hilum, liver
nodule in the mid portion of the right lobe, also a region of
the gallbladder.
[**2144-11-17**]: [**2144-11-26**]- an ultrasound guided liver biopsy was
performed at [**Hospital1 **]; lesion consistent with small cell lung
cancer. Staining shows positivity for synaptophysin, TTF-1, with
weak positivity for CK 7 and chromogranin (Pathologist Dr
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 83828**]). Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurology ordered anti-[**Doctor Last Name **]
and anti-striate muscle antibody which are positive, done on
[**2144-12-7**]. (Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] positive by immunofluorescence, but was not
positive by Western blot). A head MRI was performed on [**12-16**]
and showed no evidence of intracranial malignancy.
[**2144-12-18**]: Started chemotherapy
[**2145-3-18**]: Complete chemotherapy
[**2145-6-17**]: Dermatomyositis flare; subsequently given course of
steroids, IVIG, methotrexate. Interval CT scans do not show
obvious evidence of cancer progression.
[**2145-10-18**]: Pulmonary Embolism [**2145-11-7**], started on Lovenox
[**2145-11-17**]: hematochezia thought to be inflammatory colitis,
resolved with rectal steroids
[**2145-12-18**]: Dermatomyositis (DM) flare with fevers and ulcerative
lesions; CT on [**2146-1-7**] shows no progression of cancer
[**2146-2-15**]: Fevers, DM continue; lovenox implicated as one of
causes of fevers; fondiparinux substituted for lovenox. Hi dose
IV steroids used to control DM sx.
[**2146-3-18**]: Fevers abated with use of fondiparinux. PETCT suggests
inflammatory changes rather than overt SCLC recurrence.
[**2146-5-18**]: Recurrent disease seen mainly in liver on PETCT
[**2146-6-6**].

TREATMENT HISTORY:
FIRST LINE REGIMEN: carboplatin (5 AUC on day 1) and
etoposide(80mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) every 21 days per cycle.
-Started [**2144-12-21**] and completed 6 cycles. Last chemo given on
[**2145-4-9**].
SECOND LINE REGIMEN: carboplatin (5 AUC on day 1) and etoposide
(80mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) every 21 days per cycle. Repeated
regimen since was >1 year at time of recurrence. Had response.
-Started [**2146-6-14**] C1 D1, and completed 6 cycles without
complication, last chemo on [**2146-10-6**].
[**2146-11-22**] - continues on chemotherapy break after good response on
CT

CTA Pulmonary [**2147-10-3**]:  Acute pulmonary emboli to the right
main, upper, middle and lower lobar pulmonary arteries.  Small

Focal consolidation in the right lower lobe may represent
pulmonary infarct or pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with stage IV small cell
lung cancer s/p carboplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan C4 with
metastases to brain and liver, now presenting with complaint of

hypotension in the setting of a newly diagnosed large pulmonary
embolism and [**Last Name (un) **].

#  PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  In setting of active malignancy.
Patient was initially started on a heparin gtt then subsequently
transitioned to fondaparinux and coumadin (allergy to lovenox).
Discharged when INR was 2.1 (given fondaparinux on day of
discharge so technically bridged for 24 hours).  Patient was
written for coumadin 5mg QD but switched to 4mg QD on discharge
given steep rise of INR.  Did not have oxygen requirement on
discharg
