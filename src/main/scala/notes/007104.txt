Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2191-9-17**] after MVC. His initial
injuries were: left rib fractures [**2-15**], right midshaft ulnar
fracture, right posterior acetabular fracture, and retrosternal
hematoma. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. Of
note, his home aggrenox (which he takes for pmh of CVA) was
held.
On HD3 he was taken to the operating room by orthopedic surgery
for open reduction internal fixation of right ulnar shaft
fracture. He was kept intubated postop overnight because or poor
respiratory effort and decreased ability to clear secretions at
baseline.
On HD4 tube feeds were started via OGT. A thoracic epidural was
also placed for pain control.
On HD5 the patient was extubated and diet was advanced as
tolerated.
On HD6 the patient had an episode of respiratory distress with
desaturation to the low 80s for which he required re-intubation.
On HD7 the patient received 2U of PRBCs for a Hct of 20.6. He
was hypotensive to the mid 80s and his epidural was discontinued
with improvement of hypotension and increase in urine output.
On HD9 the patient was found to have a left cephalic vein
thrombosis for which he was treated conservatively with
extremity elevation and warm compresses.
A thoracenthesis was also performed and yelded about 1L of
serosanguinous fluid which was sent to gram stain and culture.
The patient was re-extubated on [**2191-9-27**], and his pulmonary
function started to improve. He was initially on face tent for
supplemental oxygen, but this was transitioned to nasal cannula
on [**2191-10-1**]. The patient had persistent agitation and confusion
throughout his hospital stay, but this was worse on [**2191-9-29**],
requiring intermittent haldol. The patient was initially
receiving several psych and narcotic medications but these were
discontinued and patient's sedation improved. Geriatrics was
consulted on [**2191-10-1**] and made recommendations to discontinue
multiple of his medications and start olanzepine standing and
prn for agitation. Diuresis with lasix was also suggested and
carried out successfully, resulting in clearing of his pulmonary
congestion. A 1:1 sitter was also recommended for safety, as
well as removal of his foley which was executed.

On [**2191-10-1**] the patient was transferred to the floor. At that
time he was hemodynamically stable, only on nasal cannula with
O2 sats in the low 90s. By the time of discharge, his oxygen
saturations remained in the high 90's on room air with continued
pulmonary toileting. He was monitored on telemetry until
discharge and remained in NSR. His vital signs were routinely
monitored and he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
His electrolytes were checked and repleted as needed as within
normal limits at the time of discharge. CBC's were monitored and
his hematocrit remained stable (29.7 at discharge) as well as
his WBC count (9.9 at discharge). He remained on lovenox for DVT
prophylaxis per orthopedic recommendations.

He was receiving tube feeds via dobhoff tube. Overnight on [**10-1**]
the patient self-d/c'd his dobhoff due to agitation. He also
became agitated and combative, and restraints and a 1:1 sitter
were implemented according to recommendations from a geriatric
consult. On [**2191-10-2**], the dobhoff feeding tube was replaced. His
delirium began to improve with implementation of geriatric
recommendations. On [**2191-10-4**], the patient's mental status was
much clearer and the 1:1 sitter and restraints remained off. He
was able to tolerate PO intake with a soft diet and nectar
prethickened liquid, and his dobhoff was therefore removed. He
was voiding without difficulty.

Physical and occupational therapy continued to follow Mr.
[**Known lastname **] throughout his postoperative period. By the time of
discharge he was able to tranfer with assistance from bed to
chair. See p.3 PT evaluation for details of patient mobility. He
maintained weightbearing as tolerated on his RUE and partial
weightbearing status on his RLE.

On the day of discharge on [**2191-10-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was afebrile
without signs of infection and hemodynamically stable. He
reported adequate pain control on an oral regimen of standing
tylenol and low-dose oxycodone prn. His delirium was improving
and he remained alert and oriented to himself and place, but
unsure of the date and year.  His antipsychotics were
discontinued according to the recommendation of geriatrics. He
was discharged to rehab for further physical therapy and
monitoring, with plan to follow up as an outpatient with
orthopedics for his acetabular and ulnar fractures and with the
acute care service for his rib fractures.
