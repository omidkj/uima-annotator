History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 109590**] is an 87 yom with history of CAD s/p RCA and left
circumflex stent in [**2146**] and [**2151**], TIAs, afib on coumadin, MVR
s/p bioprosthetic MV in [**2151**], pacemaker, prostate cancer s/p
radiation c/b obstructive uropathy and suprapubic [**Last Name (un) **] a

.
Per family report, patient has been uncomfortable with his
catheter recently. Typically has his catheter changed every six
weeks but he had to go longer this time. Having difficulty
holding his urine, was having several accidents during the last
week. Last infection just prior to catheter change. Today he was
working out in the gym in his independent living facility,
returned to his aprtment to his wife reporting feeling weak,
rigoring severely, and was unable to stand. He was also unable
to communicate and was grunting responses only.
No documented fevers. Symptoms started acutely today. He was at
his baseline two days ago.
.
In the ED, patient triggered for appearing critically ill.
Initial vital signs were T99.4 HR84 BP148/68 RR20 O2 sat 99%RA.
He was pale, not verbally responsive, but able to shake his head
yes or no to commands. Repeat rectal temp was 102.6. Examination
was notable for lower abdominal tenderness. He had no focal
neurologic symptoms. Guaic was negative. He underwent evaluation
with head CT and CT abdomen. CBC was notable for leukocytosis.
UA strongly consistent with UTI. He received 850cc NS, and was
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. Per report his vital signs
remained stable throughout his time in the ED. Vital signs were
HR 60, BP 139/37, RR 20, 100% on 3L NC.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient verbally responsive but only
able to respond to simple questions.
.

Studies:

Cardiovascular Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2161-3-16**]  4:35:06 PM
Atrial pacing and ventricular pacing. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2161-1-29**] no significant change.

Radiology Report	CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2161-3-16**]
4:47 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.

Radiology Report	CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2161-3-16**] 4:47
PM
IMPRESSION: Lower lung volumes on the current exam. Left lower
lobe opacity
seen medially, potentially due to atelectasis; however,
infiltrate is not
completely excluded. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Radiology Report	CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of

IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. No
acute abdominal
pathology.
2. Moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal
aorta and
visceral arteries.

Cardiovascular Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2161-3-17**]  1:25:12 PM
Atrio-ventricular pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2161-3-16**] the
ventricular rate is slower.

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increased area
of atelectasis at the left lung base, presence of a minimal left
pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumonia, no
pulmonary edema.

[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]       [**Hospital1 18**] [**Numeric Identifier 109591**]Portable TTE
(Complete) Done [**2161-3-18**] at 4:44:26 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-1-11**],
the degree of pulmonary hypertension has increased. The right
ventricle appears mildly dilated/hypokinetic. The other findings
are similar.
