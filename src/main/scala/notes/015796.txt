History of Present Illness:
77 yo woman w/ h/o Adeno Ca s/p chemo/xrt/resection, COPD, DVT,
and HTN, who presents from NH w/ lethargy, worsening shortness
of breath, and respiratory distress.  Patient reports increasing
dyspnea at rest and on exertion over the last week.  Denies CP,
but c/o some pain w/ coughing.  +cough w/ yellow sputum x 1
week.  +nausea, denies vomiting.  +abd pain w/ nausea, however,
denies abd pain at this time.  +wt gain (10 lbs) over a "short
period of time."  No dietary changes.  Denies fever, chills,
dizziness, or syncope.
.
Upon arrival to ED, O2 sats were in the mid-80s, and patient was
hypertensive to 200s.  Patient also febrile to 102.  Nitro drip
was started which brought SBP down to 140s.  She was given lasix
w/ ~500cc urine output, as well as combivent nebs.  Patient was
also given antibiotics for UTI.  CXR did not reveal CHF or
consolidation.  CTA ruled out PE, but revealed aspiration PNA.
Aspiration was treated w/ levo 500mg x1, and flagyl 500mg x1.
Patient admitted to MICU for further treatment.
.
Upon arrival to MICU, patient satting well on NRB.  BP's
improved on nitro gtt at 133/70.  Nitro gtt turned off.  During
evaluation, patient's BP slowly drifted down to ~100 systolic.
Then dropping further to SBP in the 80's.  500cc fluid bolus
started, BP's continued to drop to SBP in 70's; therefore,
levophed started.  SBP increased to 100-110's after 1.5L NS,
levophed, and decadron 4mg x1.  Patient placed on BiPAP.  ABG on
NRB prior to BiPAP 7.32/72/272.

Pertinent Results:
.
DIAGNOSTICS:
[**2116-3-17**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Post-lobectomy changes evident in the
right hemithorax. Correlate with surgical history (not
provided). Minimal left basilar atelectasis with no focal
consolidation or edema.
.
[**2116-3-17**] CT chest :  IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Consolidation and peribronchial thickening in the right lower
lobe, with retained secretions in the trachea, suggesting
aspiration or aspiration pneumonia.
3. Previous right partial pneumonectomy and other stigmata of
treatment for lung cancer.
4. Atherosclerotic celiac axis narrowing.
.

[**2116-3-25**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Overall, improved aeration compared to
[**2116-3-24**]. Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube.
Minimal residual left lower lobe atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo woman w/ h/o Lung Adeno Ca s/p chemo/xrt/resection, COPD,
DVT, and HTN, who presents from NH w/ lethargy, respiratory
distress, initially hypertensive emergency, followed by
hypotension.
.
MICU COURSE:
.
#) HYPOXIA/HYPERCARBIC RESP FAILURE: On admission, the patient
was initially  hypoxic, improved on NRB.  She also was noted to
have HTN with SBP 200s, which improved with nitro gtt.
Respiratory status initially improved with lasix and nebs.
Etiology was felt to be multifactorial, including CHF, COPD
exacerbation, and pneumonia.  She ultimately required intubation
due to hypercarbic respiratory failure (elevated PCO2 around
70s) with decreased mental status on BiPAP.  She was treated for
pneumonia with 7 days of vancomycin.  She had initially been on
zosyn, cipro, and flagyl as well, but these were discontinued as
there was no evidence of GNR infection.  Sputum culture grew
only beta strep (not group A).  She was initially on
hydrocortisone (due to hypotension and adrenal insufficiency)
and was continued on a prednisone taper for COPD when this was
completed.  She was also on standing albuterol and atrovent.
She was extubated on [**3-20**], but required reintubation later that
day due to tachypnea and respiratory distress with increased
secretions.  She was then further diuresed with lasix and was
ultimately extubated on [**3-25**].  From that time she did well,
continuing on her prednisone taper and prn nebs.  She was also
started on spiriva to maximize her COPD regimen.  On [**2116-3-29**] she
was transfered to the floor, and her oxygen was slowly weened
back to her home level of 2L nasal cannula.  She will complete a
steroid taper with 4 more days of 30mg prednisone, then 4 days
of 20mg, then 4 days of 10mg, then stop.
.
#) HYPOTENSION: The patient initially presented with
hypertensive urgency.  She was on a nitro gtt, which was
titrated off after diuresis.  The patient's SBP then dropped to
the 70s, requiring fluid boluses and pressors.  She was also
found to have adrenal insufficiency with an inappropriate [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stim.  She was therefore treated with hydrocortisone and
fludrocortisone as stress dose steroids.  The hypotension was
felt to be due to sepsis from her pneumonia, which was treated
with vancomycin as above.
.
#) MAT:  Throughout her course, the patient was noted to have
episodes of MAT, with variable heart rate.  She was initially on
metoprolol, but this failed to adequately control her heart
rate.  She was therefore started on a diltiazem drip, and then
converted to PO diltiazam which controlled both her BP and HR.
Her home dose of metoprolol was added back to achieve the best
control of her tachycardia.
.
#) UTI: UA was positive on admission, but culture grew only
~[**2109**] of corynebacterium/diphtheroids.  The patient completed a
course of antibiotics for pneumonia as above.
.
#) HTN: Hypertensive urgency treated as above.  Thereafter,
diltiazem was used as above to treat MAT and also to manage
blood pressure.  Her home dose of metoprolol was added back to
her medications as well.  Her SBP on discharge was 130-150 with
HR 80-90.
.
#) PPX: patient was placed on heparin SC for DVT ppx, bowel
regimen, H2 blocker for GI ppx but she will be discharged on her
home prilosec.
.
#) Code status: Full code
.
#) DISPO: patient will be discharged back to [**Hospital3 537**].
