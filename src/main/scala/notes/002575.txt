Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath (initial CC)
Transfer from OSH for NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy and PTCA of left
circumflex artery


History of Present Illness:
49 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary
artery disease with ?PCI and stents, presenting from [**Location (un) **]
with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.  Initially,
the patient presented called EMS with a hx of shortness of
breath x 2 hours. He told EMS that he was unable to lie flat and
he was thought to be pale and diaphoretic.  The patient denied
any chest pain or chest pressure; he was tachycardic to the
130s, HTN to 245/128 and oxygen saturations of 75-85% on 2 L NC.
He was started on nitropaste, SL NTG in the field. Lopressor,
ativan, solumedrol, lasix, levoquin and CTX, vanco were given,
and was then bag ventilated given poor saturations and
eventually placed on mechanical ventilation and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] on transfer
from Nashobe, BP still in 150s, slowly trended down to SBP
90s-110s, on a propofol drip for sedation. He received 4L NS
with 3L uop.

Chest CT [**10-27**]
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Sequelae of massive aspiration with bilateral lower lobe
consolidation and scattered centrilobular ground-glass
opacities.
3. ET and NG tubes positioned appropriately.

TTE [**10-28**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
basal inferolateral wall and mild global hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional and mild
global left ventricular systolic function. No pathologic
valvular flow identified.

Cardiac Cath [**10-28**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
5. Acute posterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
6. Manual aspiration thrombectomy and PTCA of the late stent
thrombosis
of the LCX.

CT Head [**11-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited study secondary to motion artifact
without evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. Consider MR if there is concern for PRES as [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12287**] [**Male First Name (un) **]
the requisition.
2. Layering secretions in the [**Last Name (un) **]- and oropharynx.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**11-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar consolidations, right more than left.
2. No evidence of intra-abdominal source of fever.
3. Fatty liver

Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo man with presumed CAD, DM who presents w/ resp distress
found to be profoundly hypertensive, evidence of aspiration on
CT chest and rising CEs.
.
1) NSTEMI:  Pt presented with shortness of breath, rising
troponins, and LBBB (unknown baseline), overall suspicious for
ACS, possibly in the setting of hypertensive emergency and flash
pulmonary edema. Troponin, CKs rising since presentation to OSH.
 Pt denied any history of pain.  He was started on IV heparin.
He was continued on ASA, Plavix which he was taking his coronary
stent.  Troponins were cycled X 3 with elevation in CK-MB and
troponins. ECHO showed akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall
and mild global hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40
%). Cardiology was consulted, and cath patient underwent cardiac
cath, which showed in-stent restenosis of patient's prior LCx
stent, and underwent thrombectomy and re-stenting.  Patient was
also found to have moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
2) Acute on chronic Heart Failure:  Patient was found to have
moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction (EF 40%), and
required Lasix diuresis for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
He responded well to a Lasix drip, with no supplemental O2
requirement on discharge.
.
2) Aspiration PNA - Febrile with WBC count elevated at 27 on
initial labs, now trending down likely after fluid
resuscitation. Aspiration PNA vs pneumonitis read based on
appearance on CT Chest.  He was started on vancomycin, cefepime,
and ciprofloxacin.  Sputum and blood cultures were obtained, but
were negative.  Patient finished a course of treatment for
aspiration PNA and antibiotics were subsequently d/c'ed.
.
3) Persistent Fevers - Patient continued to be febrile despite
broad antibiotic coverage, and was believed to be febrile [**2-24**]
DTs vs. drug fever, as all cultures and infectious w/u was
negative following the initial imaging of aspiration PNA vs.
pneumonitis.  Following the resolution of DTs and d/c of CIWA,
patient's antibiotics were discontinued after a full course of
treatment for possible aspiration pneumonia.  Patient's fevers
resolved shortly thereafter with all cultures negative.  Likely
fevers [**2-24**] DTs or from antibiotics which were started to treat
aspiration PNA on intial presentation, and had completely
resolved prior to discharge.
.
4) Acute renal failure - Pt was admitted with elevated
creatinine, which improved upon receiving IVF.  Likely [**2-24**] poor
perfusion in the setting of NSTEMI.
.
5) Mental Status - Patient was initially sedated on a vent, but
was weaned off vent and sedation following cardiac
catheterization.  Once off sedation, the patient went into DTs
from alcohol withdrawal, and CIWA scale was promptly initiated
and patient was re-intubated with re-initiation of sedation.
Patient was gradually weaned off sedation and extubated, and
CIWA scale was continued until patient's DTs resolved.  Mental
status returned to baseline prior to discharge.  Patient was
seen by social work re: quitting alcohol use and was interested
in quitting alcohol use on discharge.
.
6) DM:  Patient requ
