HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 5579**] is a
79-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who
presents from Shore House Rehabilitation following episodes
of tachypnea, hypoxemia and obtundation requiring
endotracheal intubation.  The patient is status post recent
hospitalization from [**7-4**] to [**2183-7-25**] for gallstone
pancreatitis requiring open cholecystectomy and
choledochoduodenostomy on [**2183-7-11**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**] with
hospitalization complicated by E. coli sepsis, volume
overload and bilateral pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation
and postop abdominal abscess which grew out Vancomycin
Resistant Enterococcus.

The patient subsequently had a gallbladder drainage by CT
guidance on [**2183-7-18**].  The patient suffered C. diff colitis at
prior hospitalization.  Towards the end of hospitalization
was noted to have acute tachypnea.  She was subsequently
discharged to Shore House on [**2183-7-25**] on antibiotics
Linezolide for four week course for her Vancomycin resistant
enterococcus abscess and Flagyl for 14 day course for C. diff
colitis.

At the Shore House however, the patient was doing poorly with
continued lethargy, anorexia and depression.  The patient was
noted to develop hyponatremia.  She apparently developed
cough on [**7-29**] for which she was treated with Robitussin and
the day prior to admission was noted to have hypoxemia with
O2 saturations 90% on two liters nasal cannula.

On the morning of presentation to [**Hospital1 190**] the patient shortly was noted to become more
tachypneic and somnolent with oxygen saturation in the 60's
and requiring 100% non-rebreather.  The patient subsequently
then became unresponsive and was subsequently started manual
artificial respirations and was sent to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation.

In the Emergency Room she was afebrile, heart rate in the 80s
and blood pressure 140/80, oxygen saturation 90% on 100%
non-rebreather, unresponsive.  The patient subsequently
intubated at the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 190**].  She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
for further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease, FEV 1 of 1.74, 70%
    predicted.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of
    60%  Basal septal hypokinesis.
5.  History of Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to aspirin.
6.  Degenerative joint disease.
7.  Migraine headaches.
8.  Cataracts.
9.  Substernal goiter with hypothyroidism status post
    biopsy.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin which causes gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON PRESENTATION:
1.  Linezolide 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. q 8 hours.
3.  Percocet
4.  Atenolol 100 mg q day.
5.  Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. q day.
6.  Levoxyl 75 mcg q day.
7.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q day.
8.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day.
9.  Florinef 0.1 mg p.o. q day.
10. Prednisone 30 mg p.o. q day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon presentation the patient was
subsequently intubated, temperature 101, heart rate 70 to 80
and atrial fibrillation.  Blood pressure 107/48 on Dopamine.
Skin was dry.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Oropharynx dry.  Neck:
Prominent external jugular veins.  Lungs:  Bilaterally coarse
breath sounds.  Cardiac:  Irregular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Surgical site healing
well.  Hyperactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender to
palpation.  Extremities:  No edema, peripheral pulses 2+.
Neurological:  Moving all extremities.  On vent setting,
assist control 500, tidal volume, respiratory rate of 17,
FIO2 0.7, PEEP of 5.

LABS ON PRESENTATION:  White count 17,300, hematocrit 33.5,
platelets 187,000.  Prothrombin time of 14, PTT 30, sodium
130, potassium 2.7, chloride 94, bicarbonate 26, BUN 13,
creatinine 0.3, glucose 81.  Calcium 7.1, magnesium 1.2,
albumin 2.2, CK 75, troponin less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray revealed left effusion, questionable
consolidation left base with mass with tracheal deviation
which is unchanged from [**7-22**].  CT of the chest revealed
no pulmonary embolism, moderate bilateral pleural effusions
slightly increased from [**2183-7-23**].  Left sided atelectasis,
partial collapse adjacent to pleural effusion.  Superior
mediastinal mass calcific densities consistent with right
goiter with deviation of the trachea.  Scattered ground glass
opacities in both lungs.  CT of the head revealed no
bleeding.  Chronic small vessels with ischemic changes.
Fluid in the mastoid ear cells, right greater than left,
right middle ear.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient was subsequently admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
She is a 79-year-old person with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure
presents from rehabilitation on [**2183-8-6**] following episode of
tachypnea, hypoxia, obtundation requiring intubation with
presumed sepsis.  The patient is status post recent
hospitalization [**7-4**] to [**7-25**] for gallstone pancreatitis
requiring open cholecystectomy and choledochoduodenostomy
with hospitalization complicated by sepsis, volume overload
and bilateral effusions, atrial fibrillation, C. diff colitis
and postoperative intra-abdominal abscess at the
port-a-hepatis requiring CT guidance drainage and extended
therapeutic use of Linezolid.  The patient had one episode of
unexplained respiratory decompensation at hospitalization
characterized by respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.  She had
a negative CT angio of the chest and episode resolved on its
own after treatment with high flow oxygen.  The patient had
been failing to thrive at rehabilitation with poor p.o.
intake, unable to fully participate in rehabilitation
activities.

THE patient presented on [**2183-8-6**] in ventilatory failure and
hypertension requiring volume resuscitation and temple
posterior support.  Sputum grew out Klebsiella and urine grew
out pseudomonas.  All blood cultures were surprisingly
negative.  The initial impression was that the patient may
have aspirated however, further workup revealed a
questionable myopathy and we suspected she is unable to
effectively clear her secretions.  She has since undergone a
complicated tracheostomy requiring tracheal repair and open
sternotomy.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM AND PLAN:
1.  Pulmonary.  Infectious disease.  The patient initially
presented with hypoxemia, hypercarbia, respiratory failure
requiring intubation.  The patient originally spiked to 102.8
and developed leukocytosis to 37,000.  Chest x-ray showed
bilateral moderate effusions with ill defined opacification
in the right lung.  CT angio of the chest revealed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism, scattered ground glass
opacity, emphysematous changes and moderate bilateral
effusions, slightly increased since last hospitalization.
She also demonstrated a large substernal goiter which was
unchanged.  She was co
