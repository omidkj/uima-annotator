Findings
The patient at the initial exam did have mild MR. However, MR
became dynamic at varying stages to even become a 3plus at one
stage as shown in the images. This was consulted with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **]
and the same informed to Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. No LV aneurysm. Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Severe global LV hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The TEE probe was
passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a
laryngoscope. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. Suboptimal image quality - poor echo
windows. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. No left ventricular
aneurysm is seen. There is severe global LV systolic dysfunction
with focalities in the apex, septal and inferior walls.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. The mitral regurgitant jet was eccentric,
varying in time and quantity reflecting an ischemic basis. The
annulus was 34-36mm and the left atrium and ventricle were
dilated. There was blunting of pulmonary venous inflow when
moderate to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 48613**].
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-Bypass:
Overall LVEF 35% on milrinone.
Mild improvement of focal LV systolic function.
Normal RV systolic function.
A prosthesis is seen on the mitral annulus stable and well
seated. There was no m itral regurgitation seen. Mean pressure
gradient across the mitral valve was 4mm of Hg.
Aortic contour is well preserved.
Trivial TR/.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

FINAL REPORT


REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Follow up of patient after CABG.

PA and lateral upright chest graft compared to [**2101-11-19**].


Additional improvement of the bilateral atelectasis has been
observed with
still remaining left retrocardiac atelectasis. The left pleural
effusion has
been decreased. There are no new consolidations. There is no
pneumothorax.
The sternal wires are intact. There is no evidence of congestive
heart
failure.

IMPRESSION: Improvement of bilateral plate-like atelectasis.
Unchanged left
lower lobe atelectasis. Remaining left tiny pleural effusion.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2101-11-16**] and underwent cabg x4/MV repair with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on
levophed, propofol, and milrinone drips. Extubated the next
morning and transferred to the floor on POD #2 to begin
increasing his activity level. Beta blockade and ACE inhibitor
started and gentle diuresis continued. Pacing wires and chest
tubes removed without incident. Cleared for discharge to home on
POD #6 with VNA services.

paroxetine 10 mg daily
crestor 10 mg daily
ibuprofen 600 mg prn
glyburide 5 mg daily
