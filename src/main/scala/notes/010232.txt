Pertinent Results:
[**2100-8-26**] TEE, Intra-op
Conclusions
PRE-Operative:
The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2100-8-26**]
at 1215.

POST-Operative:
Estimated ejection fraction and left ventricular function are
unchanged from prebypass. There is no evidence of aortic
dissection in observed images. Valvular function is unchanged
from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2100-8-26**] where
the patient underwent Off-pump CABG x 1 with LIMA-LAD.  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
