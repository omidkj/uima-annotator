Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-11-3**]:
Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from aorta to the 1st obtuse marginal
coronary; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to
posterior descending coronary artery. Left anterior descending
coronary artery endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty.

History of Present Illness:
65 yo male with chronic atrial fibrillation with new onset
dyspnea on exertion. Recent stress testing showed mild
anteroseptal ischemia. Subsequent cardiac catheterization
revealed multivessel coronary artery disease. He was referred
for surgical revascularization. He continued to experience
dyspnea on exertion but remains very active at home. He performs
routine ADL without difficulty. He denies chest pain, orthopnea,
PND, pedal edema and palpitations. Of note, patient has never on
Warfarin anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation. He has
been maintained on Aspirin only and has declined/refused
Warfarin.

Pertinent Results:
[**2169-11-3**] TTE: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is an inferobasal
left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricle displays
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly to
moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
POST BYPASS The patient is atrially paced. There is normal right
ventricular systolic function. The left ventricle displays
overall normal systolic function with the exception of the
inferobasal aneurysm. The mitral regurgitation is slightly
worsened but remains mild. The ascending aortic graft is only
very poorly seen. The portions of the ascending, arch, and
descending thoracic aorta that are seen are free of dissection.

[**2169-11-4**] CXR: There is dense retrocardiac opacity consistent
with combination of volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. The extreme
left CP angle is off the film. Right IJ line tip is in the SVC.
Increased opacity at the right base suggesting an area of volume
loss/infiltrate in this region. This is new compared to the
prior study. Sternal wires and mediastinal clips are again seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2169-11-3**] where the patient underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous vein single
graft from aorta to the 1st obtuse marginal coronary; reverse
saphenous vein
single graft from aorta to posterior descending coronary artery,
left anterior descending coronary artery endarterectomy and vein
patch angioplasty and replacement of ascending aorta with a
28-mm Dacron tube graft. Please see operative note for surgical
details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable
on no inotropic or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight. The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication. The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility. Additionally, Occupational Therapy was
consulted given the patient's AKA and dependence on prosthesis.
He does have long history of atrial fibrillation and remained in
AF post-op. As in the past, he declined/refused Warfarin and was
continued on Aspirin. In addition, Plavix was started for the
LAD endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty
By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics. The patient was discharged to rehab ([**Hospital3 **]
in [**Hospital1 3597**], NH) in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
