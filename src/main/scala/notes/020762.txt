sternal wound.  Was treated for COPD exacerbation with steroids
in the post-op period.  During routine post-op check was noted
to have frank purulent drainage from the lower pole of the
incision and an open area.  Upon further questioning of the
rehab facility where he was staying, it became evident that the
drainage began on [**2137-3-19**] and was treated with PO cipro and
topical neosporin and dressing changes.  Admitted for
debridement and closure, and IV antibiotics on [**2137-3-27**].
