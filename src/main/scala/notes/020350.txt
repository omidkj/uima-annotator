History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 68 y.o man with history of recurrent
esophageal cancer, right MCA stroke with residual left
hemiplegia who presents to the hospital [**2193-11-26**] after falling

.
.
Mr [**Known lastname 5890**] states that on Monday, [**2193-11-25**], he remembers
distinctly having a very large BM, standing and stepping away
from the toilet, after stepping out of the BR he realized that
he should flush the toilet again, at which point he turned to go
back into the bathroom and caught his foot on the divider
between the [**Doctor Last Name **] and the bathroom falling into the bathroom and
hitting his head. He states that he did not experience any LOC,
but did feel (before he fell) that he was going to need to sit
down because he was feeling fatigued. Denies dizzyness prior to
the fall or other prodrome.

.
Upon arrival to the ED, initial vs were: 98 111 182/104 20 95%.
X-rays showed left femoral neck fracture, CT head and C-spine
were negative and he was noted to have tachycardia and new O2
requirment. He had a CTA chest which did not show PE.
Orthopedics saw patient in the emergency room and planned for
hemiarthroplasty on [**2193-11-27**]. Due to new oxygen requirement an
ABG was sent which showed pH 7.46, pCO2 32, pO2 71, HCO3 23. Pt
also received morphine in ED. Vitals prior to transfer to ICU
were 120/7, 112 22 98% on 2L. Of note, the pt reported that he
had missed his daily metoprolol succinate 50mg.

Imaging:
Echo:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Left atrial appendage ejection
velocity profile suggests underlying atrial flutter. The right
atrial aThe descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta to 35 cm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but without
vegetations seen. There is trace aortic regurgitation. There is
a small (4 mm) focal area of calcification at the tip of the
left coronary leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened but without mass or vegetation seen. Mild [1+] mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened without mass or vegetations seen.

IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets without
discrete vegetation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Simple aortic atheroma.
.
CT Chest/Pelvis:
FINDINGS:

Stable heart size. Calcification of the mitral valve. No
pericardial
effusion. Stable small sliding hiatal hernia. Trace bilateral
effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis. Incidental gynecomastia.

ABDOMEN: Liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions or
intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. The hepatic flexure is interposed
between the
diaphragm and the anterior margin of the liver. Stable normal
adrenal glands,
pancreas, and spleen. Multiple hypodense lesions are seen in the
kidney on
the right, too small to further characterize and likely cystic.
Stable
minimal perinephric stranding. No hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Minimal
thickening of the gallbladder wall is seen in comparison to
recent prior exam,
and maybe related to underdistension. No radiopaque gallstones
or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

Abdominal aorta remains tortuous with minimal ectasia of the
distal abdominal
aorta just proximal to the bifurcation, measuring up to 2.8 cm
anteroposterior. Two infrarenal IVC filters are again noted with
gradual
narrowing and occlusion in the distal IVC below the level of the
filters.
Venous collaterals are again noted in the anterior abdominal
wall. No
significant retroperitoneal adenopathy is seen.

The stomach contains oral contrast material and air. Small bowel
loops are
normal in caliber. No evidence of free fluid, abnormal fluid
collections, or
transition point. Abundant stool is retained throughout the
right colon.
Under distention of the left colon. Stable metallic densities
are seen in the
right lower quadrant and mid lower abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Urinary bladder is unremarkable. Prostate and
seminal
vesicles are unchanged. Rectosigmoid containing stool without
other
abnormality. Stable small fat-containing inguinal hernias. No
significant
pelvic or inguinal adenopathy by CT size criteria.

Bones: Stable alignment left femoral neck fracture. No other
acute osseous
abnormality is identified. Multilevel degenerative changes of
the visualized
thoracolumbar spine and bilateral sacroiliac joints.

IMPRESSION:
No apparent acute abnormality to account for fever and
bacteremia. Multiple
other chronic and incidental findings as above.
.
CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolism.
2. No evidence of traumatic injury in the abdomen.
3. Mildly displaced left femoral neck fracture.
4. Chronic occlusion of the IVC with multiple abdominal wall
collaterals.
5. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta, with
mild ectasia
of the infrarenal aorta.
.
CT C-spine without
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cervical spine
