History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old woman with history of hypertension who
presented to the ED with throat and mouth pain and hematuria.
She notes a swollen left neck which is tender to palpation. She
had myalgias and fevers for the past several days, along with
gross hematuria for the past two weeks (although she has a
history of microscopic hematuria). She denies headache, cough,
dysuria.
.
She was seen three days ago in the ED, where she presented for
multiple complaints. A U/A was performed and was negative for
infection but grossly bloody. She was discharged with no other
interventions.
.
On the day of admission, she saw her PCP and was sent to the ED
with concern for peritonsillar abscess and abnormal labs
(elevated white count). At some point she was seen by ENT and
was started on acyclovir and prednisone 10mg daily for Zoster on
the tonsils.
.
In the ED on the day of admission, her vital signs were T98.5,
HR 87, BP 91/61, RR 22, Sat 93%RA. She received levofloxacin
750mg x 1, ceftriaxone 2g x 1, and vancomycin 1g x 1. Initial
lactate was 2.8. A CT neck was performed without contrast (given
elevated creatinine) with no peritonsillar abscess noted. Her
temperature was noted to climb to 103F and her blood pressures
were dropping, so a right IJ was placed. Levophed was started in
the ED. She received a total of 7L fluid in the ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was mildly short of breath and
extremely wheezy. Her breathing improved with nebulizer
treatments and use of non-invasive ventilation. Her blood
pressure stabilized off of pressors.  She grew gram positive
rods [**12-27**] anaerobic bottles.  She received vancomycin and
augmentin.  She appeared fluid overloaded from agressive
hydration and required supplemental oxygen and nebulizers to
help with her breathing.  She was stable on transfer to floor.

diverticuli, or calculi noted. Ureteral orifices were normal in
size and location with clear efflux; mild trigonitis

.
EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals. Isolated Q
in III. No ischemic changes.
.
Imaging:
CXR [**10-17**]: The heart is mild to moderately enlarged in size with
a left ventricular configuration. The aorta is mildly tortuous.
The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. The
lung volumes are overall low. There is bibasilar atelectasis. No
discrete focal opacity is identified. The soft tissues and
osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: No
acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT PORT  [**10-18**]:  Deep vein thrombosis
of the left internal jugular vein.
.
CT Neck [**10-18**]: 1. Limited evaluation secondary to lack of
intravenous contrast administration. No definite left tonsillar
abnormality.  2. Septal thickening and bilateral pleural
effusions likely reflect an element of pulmonary edema. Clinical
correlation recommended.
.
MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST  [**10-19**]:  Left internal jugular vein and
basal left sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Left internal jugular vein
thrombophlebitis. Surrounding induration suggeting infection. No
evidence of abscess.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**10-21**]: Occlusive thrombus within
the right internal jugular vein, unchanged in appearance and
extent compared to 3 days prior.
.
MRV HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**10-21**]:  Findings on the MRV of the head
is suggestive of extension of jugular vein thrombosis to the
left sigmoid sinus. Otherwise, the MRV of the head is normal.
.
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**10-22**]:  Left internal jugular
vein septic thrombophlebitis extending to the skull base with
edema in the retropharyngeal space, without convincing drainable
fluid collection identified.  Moderate-sized bilateral pleural
effusion with worsening of airspace disease in the right lung
apex.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**10-24**]:  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**10-24**]:  No evidence of internal carotid
artery stenosis on either site.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**10-26**]:  1. No pulmonary
embolism.  2. Predominantly peripherally located, mostly
wedge-shaped pulmonary opacities without areas of cavitation
could be consistent with early septic emboli. However, other
infectious and inflammatory etiologies should be considered.  3.
Partial occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein with
extension of clot from the left internal jugular vein. Possible
occlusion of the left axillary vein, although this is
incompletely assessed on this study. If there is clinical
concern for left-sided venous obstruction, a dedicated
ultrasound venous exam should be performed.  4. Moderate pleural
effusions.
.
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**10-26**]: 1. Again demonstrated
is thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein likely extending
cephalad up to the sigmoid sinus.  2. There are no abscesses of
the neck.  3. No significant change in the cervical lymph nodes.
 4. Again seen are moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
ground-glass densities of the right lung apex.
.
TTE [**10-24**]:  The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
57yF with no major past medical history who presented with
fever, hypotension, and left neck swelling and found to have L
IJ septic thrombophelbitis, Strep milleri bacteremia, and basal
left sigmoid sinus thrombosis.
.
# Septic shock:  This resolved within 24 hours in the ICU upon
initiation of antibiotics.  The source is felt to be septic
thrombophlebitis of L IJ.  Blood cultures on admission grew
Strep milleri bactermia.  Please see below.
