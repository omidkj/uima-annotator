Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis x 3 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multiple bronchoscopies
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
72yo F w/distant h/o TB who presents w/hemoptysis x 3 wks. Per
pt's daughter, she had febrile illness ~1 month ago associated
w/cough and had 2 episodes of hemoptysis with it. She coughed up
1 teaspoon of blood the first time ~4wks ago and she was treated
with a z-pak for bronchitis; then another episode of coughing
spasm 1 wk later w/~[**1-18**] cup blood she was treated with 10 days
of levofloxacin for possible PNA. She went to [**Hospital1 2177**] and had a
sputum AFB negative for TBx 1. The fever and cough seemed to
resolve and she did not have any more episodes of hemoptysis
until Wed night, 3 days prior to presentation. At that time She
had coughing and small volume-1 teaspoon-of hemoptysis. It
resolved until the next morning when she had another episode of
hemoptysis which again was ~[**1-18**] cup and her daughter brought her
to the [**Name (NI) **]. No recent fever/chills, no CP, but +SOB w/coughing.
.
In the ED, her vitals were T 98 BP HR 94 RR 18 sat 100%RA. She
was intubated for airway protection. At 3pm had 200cc of
hemoptysis in the ED. CT chest revealed dense colidation in LUL.
Interventional Pulmonology was consulted and bronch was
performed - blood clot was seen at the level of the carina,
between the apicoposterior and anterior segments of the left
upper lobe. No endobronchial lesions or active bleeding was
noted. Pt's HCT was stable at that time, she was not transfused.
Covered for PNA w/Azithromycin 250 mg, CeftriaXONE 1g.
.
On ROS, her daughter notes that prior to her febrile illness 1
month ago, she had been very well. She was active and did not
have any ongoing medical problems. Since the illness, she has
had a 10lbs weight loss. She had one recent episode of
lightheadedness. No hematemesis/abdominal pain, no
diarrhea/hematochezia. + night sweats with the febrile illness
4wks ago, none since or prior.
.
Pt was then transferred to the MICU.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2113-7-20**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.  PENICILLIN SENSITIVITY AVAILABLE ON
REQUEST.

CHEST CT PERFORMED ON [**2113-7-14**]:
1. Unusual airspace consolidation in the left upper lobe,
anterior segment with central foci of hypodensity. Additional
findings of scattered ground-glass opacities in the left upper
lobe adjacent to the dense consolidation. Overall, findings are
most likely related to an infectious etiology (must consider
tuberculosis), though other considerations include mucoid
impaction or neoplasm. Recommend correlation with bronchoscopy.

2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

3. Calcified mediastinal, hilar, and mesenteric lymph nodes with
calcified granulomas in the lung and liver, compatible with
prior granulomatous disease (patient is known to have had prior
treated tuberculosis).
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS [**2113-7-19**]:
1. Multiple segmental and subsegmental right-sided pulmonary
emboli. This
was discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 20431**] [**Name (STitle) **] at the time of
interpretation on [**2113-7-19**].

2. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, with new regions
of
consolidation as outlined above.

3. Region of consolidation/mass in the anterior left upper lobe
now contains a small focus of air. This may be related to
biopsy.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2113-7-28**]:
Improved multifocal airspace consolidation. Specifically, there
is
continued improvement of the previously noted left upper lobe
anterior
segement consolidation which suggests that it is likely to be
infectious in etiology. Recommend followup to resolution.
BILAT UP EXT VEINS US [**2113-7-21**]:
1. Occlusive DVT in the right brachial and cephalic veins.

2. Partially occlusive DVT in the right internal jugular vein.

3. Echogenic, noncompressible material in the left axillary and
subclavian veins most consistent with partially occlusive
catheter- associated thrombus. Less likely this could represent
chronic wall thickening in these vessels.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE (per MICU housestaff)

Pt is a 72 year old female with history of TB that presented
with hemoptysis for three weeks. The patient was sedated and
intubated in the MICU. The patient's INR was high and of unclear
etiology. The patient was bronched looking for the source of the
bleeding , but no source was found. The next day, there was an
episode of hemoptysis again, and the patient was again bronched.
Again, no source was found. IR attempted to find some vessels to
