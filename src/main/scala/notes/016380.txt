Imaging:
OSH NCHCT: there is interval development of a large area of
hypodensity involving the distribution of the right middle
cerebral artery.  This extends to the periphery consistent with
a
large area of cytotoxic edema.  There are areas of high
attenuation within the medial aspect of the abnoramlity c/w
areas
of hemorrhage.  Findings most c/w hemorrhagic R MCA distribution
infarct.  There is mass effect with effacement of the sulci and
compression of the body of the right lateral ventricle.  There
is
approx 2 to 3 mm of midline shift.  Hypodensity of the left
periventricular white matter is unchanged.  There is likely an
old right cerebellar infarct.  The visualized paranasal sinuses
are clear.  There is no evidence of skull fx.

OSH PCXR: no ptx, pulm vasc congestion, no frank pulm edema.

[**2192-5-9**] CT/CTA head, CTA neck:
NON-CONTRAST CT: Again demonstrated is a large right MCA
territorial infarct
with hemorrhagic transformation. There is associated edema, with
mass effect
on the adjacent lateral ventricle, and mild leftward shift of
normally midline
structures. Allowing for differences in head positioning and
slice selection,
the overall size and extent of these findings are unchanged from
three hours
prior. No new foci of hemorrhage are identified. There is no new
area of
infarction identified. Again demonstrated is encephalomalacia
from a prior
infarct in the right PCA territory as well as a lacunar infarct
involving the
left basal ganglia. Visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate
minimal mucosal
thickening of the posterior ethmoidal air cells. Osseous
structures reveal no
fracture.

CTA: Within the right internal carotid artery, immediately above
the
bifurcation, there is equivocal evidence of an intraluminal
filling defect,
which could reflect a small carotid dissection. Atherosclerotic
calcifications are also seen within this region. Additionally,
more
superiorly, there is moderate narrowing of the caliber of the
right cervical
internal carotid artery all the way to the level of the carotid
canal, which
is of unclear etiology, and could represent either
atherosclerotic narrowing
or intimal hyperplasia. Mild narrowing of the left cervical
internal carotid
artery is also present, but to a lesser extent compared to the
right.

Additionally, there is severe narrowing of the right vertebral
artery, with
atherosclerotic calcifications seen. However, the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] and its
major tributaries appear largely patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large right MCA territory infarct with hemorrhagic
transformation, and
associated mass effect and leftward shift of midline. These
findings are
largely unchanged from three hours prior.

2. Equivocal evidence of a filling defect within the right
internal carotid
artery immediately above the bifurcation, which could represent
a small
carotid dissection.

Transthoracic ECHO [**2192-5-10**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal systolic function. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.


EEG [**2192-5-11**]:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there was a
hemispheric
asymmetry with lower voltages and loss of faster frequency
activity
noted broadly over the right side.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was mildly slow, in the 6.5-7 Hz
frequency range in the posterior regions bilaterally with
admixed bursts
of moderate amplitude generalized theta frequency slowing.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from the waking to drowsy state
but did
not attain stage II sleep during the recording period.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 96 beats per minute and occasional ectopic beats.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states due to a hemispheric asymmetry with lower voltages and
loss of
faster frequency activity noted broadly over the right side.
This
finding suggests the presence of wide spread cortical and
subcortical
dysfunction on the right versus presence of material interposed
between
the cortex and surface recording electrodes (e.g. hemorrhage).
In
addition, the background was mildly slow with admixed bursts of
moderate
amplitude generalized theta frequency slowing, consistent with a
mild
encephalopathy and suggestive of dysfunction of bilateral
subcortical or
deep midline structures. There w
