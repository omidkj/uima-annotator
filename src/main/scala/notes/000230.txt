Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 663**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough

Right pleurex drain insertion [**2193-1-11**]


History of Present Illness:
85 year old female with COPD on home O2 and recent left
exudative pleural effusion who presents with cough, SOB and
palpitations.
.
She reports 1 week of worsening cough productive of yellow
sputum. Also has shortness of breath. She reports that at
baseline she has difficulty walking from room to room in her
house. She wears 3L home O2. However, in the last week, she has
had significant cough and fits of cough. She hasn't been using
her nebulizers often because they make her cough. Endorses
occasional feelings of her heart double beating after a coughing
spell. Denies fevers, chest pain, or nausea/vomiting. States her
breathing sometimes requires her to sit upright, and she told
the on-call pulmonary fellow that she has been sleeping in a
chair due to her breathing. Denies worsening lower extremity
edema, but does endorse waking up at night short of breath.
.
In late [**11-18**] she had a mild COPD exacerbation and her Symbicort
was increased and she was given azithromycin. In [**12-19**] she was
admitted to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with a new left pleural
effusion. She was found to have an "undiagnosed lymphocytic,
exudative effusion with negative cytology, AFB, bacterial and
fungal cultures." It was felt that she may eventually need a
pleuroscopy for diagnosis but the decision has not been made
given her "respiratory frailty and DNR status." She also had a
[**Hospital1 882**] admission in [**10-19**] and she had a sputum culture that
reportedly grew cephalosporin-resistent pneumococcus. She was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] (pulm) last week and had an echo that was
unchanged from prior with normal EF >55% and boderline pulmonary
hypertension.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 97 91 104/52 24 95% 3L. She was found
to be wheezy and tachypneic. ECG showed NSR at rate 77
consistent with prior. She was given solumedrol, nebulizers, and
azithromycin. CXR was normal. Labs were significant for an
elevated lactate to 3.1. Vitals on transfer 97.4 77 126/55 19
96%3L.
.
Currently on the floor she feels much improved and denies
current SOB.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Endorses 3 episodes of bowel incontinence thought
to be due to her Glucerna.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied chest pain or tightness. Denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Social History:

Radiology
.
XR CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2193-1-5**] 7:00 PM
Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Lungs
remain
hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP
diameter ofthe chest on the lateral view, consistent with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are again seen. Small bilateral pleural effusions with
overlying atelectasis are again seen. Superimposed bibasilar
consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. The
aorta remains calcified and tortuous. Cardiac silhouette is not
enlarged. Mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral
body is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
bibasilar
atelectasis. Underlying consolidation not excluded, particularly
in the
medial right lower lobe and infectious process not excluded.
.
XR CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY) Study Date of [**2193-1-6**] 9:20 AM
Right and left chest decubitus were obtained. There is minimal
amount of left pleural effusion and moderate-to-large amount of
right pleural effusion demonstrated on the decubital views.
Otherwise, no change since the prior study has been
demonstrated.
.
XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2193-1-10**] 4:31 PM
In comparison with the study of [**1-5**], there is no change in the

degree and extent of the bilateral pleural effusions with
compressive basilar atelectasis. Findings of chronic pulmonary
disease persists. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2193-1-11**] 11:46 AM
In comparison with study of [**1-10**], the patient has taken a much
better inspiration and is now upright. This may be responsible
for the
apparent decrease in the effusions, especially on the right,
though some of this may reflect the insertion of a right
tunneled catheter. Opacification at the left base is consistent
with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
.
.
Cardiology
ECG Study Date of [**2193-1-6**]  6:57:56 PM

Sinus rhythm. RSR' pattern (probable normal variant).
Anteroseptal
ST-T wave changes consistent with possible ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2193-1-5**] the rate has
increased. All other findings are similar.
