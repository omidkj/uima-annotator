HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old male with
left renal cell carcinoma admitted status post renal
embolization by Interventional Radiology, in anticipation for
a debulking left radical nephrectomy.  Approximately two
months prior to his presentation, the patient had a chest
x-ray obtained by primary care physician secondary to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
progressive cough.  The chest x-ray revealed a pulmonary
nodule.  A chest CT scan was then obtained which revealed
multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.  The needle-biopsy was
consistent with metastatic disease from renal cell carcinoma.
An abdominal CT scan revealed a 6 cm necrotic left renal
mass.

The patient denied hematuria or bony pain, fever or chills,
appetite changes or weight loss.  An MRI obtained on [**4-10**], revealed an 8.1 by 7.1 by 6 cm left renal mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left knee arthroscopy in [**2165**].

MEDICATIONS:
Ativan p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature of 96.3
F.; heart rate 69; blood pressure 117/64; respiratory rate
16; O2 saturation 93% on room air.  Cor:  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  The patient had renal embolization
performed on the 25th.  On [**4-22**], the patient was brought
to the Operating Room where a left radical nephrectomy was
performed.  The mass/kidney was adherent to the pancreas but
was dissected free.  An intraoperative consultation was
obtained with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**].

Postoperatively, the patient was on perioperative Ancef, NG
tube, [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, epidural, Foley catheter, PCA,
chest tube.  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for aggressive fluid
resuscitation.  On postoperative day one, the patient was
transferred to the Floor.  By postoperative day two, the
chest tube was removed.  A chest x-ray obtained after
removing the chest tube revealed no pneumothorax.

The patient continued to ambulate and await return of bowel
function.  On postoperative day five, the patient's epidural
and NG tube were removed.  A Physical Therapy consultation
was obtained at that time also.  On postoperative day six,
the patient's Foley catheter was removed.  On postoperative
day seven, a clear liquid diet was started as the patient
reported some flatus.  This was tolerated well with no nausea
or vomiting and therefore the diet was advanced to regular.
This was also tolerated well.  All of the patient's
medications were converted to oral form including oral pain
control.

On postoperative day eight, the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain
was noted to be minimal, approximately 20 cc per 24 hours.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] amylase was sent and the value was 110.
Therefore, the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] was removed.

chloride 108, bicarbonate 28, BUN 7, creatinine 1.1, glucose
102.
