in [**2106-7-14**] revealed [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8-1cm2 with EF 75%.  Further workup
was delayed at this time, as there was some question of GI
bleed. Endoscopy and colonoscopy have been performed in the

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-4-14**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
hickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). The peak and mean gradients are 60 and 35
m of Hg. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on Mrs [**Known lastname **] [**Name (STitle) 60351**]: Preserved biventricular
systolic function. LVEF 55%. Normal RV systolic function. Aortic
prosthesis is stable and functioning well with residual peak and
means of 30 and 12 mm of Hg. Mild to Moderate TR. Intact
thoracic aorta. Trivial MR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and on [**4-14**] she was brought to
the operating room and underwent an aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass graft. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Amiodarone was started for premature atrial
contractions and eventually discontinued. Chest tubes were
removed on post-op day two and she was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. She started on having episodes
of atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was re-started.
Epicardial pacing wires were removed and she worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility.  By the time of
discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to rehab in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
