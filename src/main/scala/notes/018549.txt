HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
woman who presented with shortness of breath and heart
failure.  The patient stated that she had been having
worsening lower extremity edema, increasing abdominal girth,
weight gain, and increasing shortness of breath over the last
ten days.  Also the patient has been seen in the clinic
recently with labs that showed severe prerenal azotemia, in
addition to her fluid retention.

The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease,
diabetes, and hypertension.  She has had multiple admissions
for severe fluid retention with renal insufficiency.  Both
catheterization and echocardiogram in [**2118**] showed mild left
ventricular hypertrophy and mitral regurgitation.  Since her
admission on [**2119-7-7**], she has gained at least 20 lbs,
recurrent massive lower extremity edema and exertional
shortness of breath.  She did not complain of any angina;
however, she is now only able to walk ten steps, and at
baseline, she is can walk one block.

The patient was referred today from the clinic to the CCU for
an elective Swan-Ganz to help assess her intracardiac
pressures and adjust her medications accordingly to see if we
can prevent her recurrent admissions for congestive heart
failure. The patient on admission was also noted to have a
hematocrit of 19, but she denied melena and hematemesis.  She
did note that she has had some blood streaked stools.  She
had a negative colonoscopy several weeks ago.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes mellitus.  2.  Coronary
artery disease.  She has had multiple catheterizations.  She
had a PTCA of the right coronary artery in [**2109**].  She had
PTCA of the left circumflex in [**2110**], and also PTCA of the
right coronary artery in [**2113**].  3.  History of congestive
heart failure.  Last echocardiogram was [**2119-9-21**],
which showed an ejection fraction of 60-65%, left atrial
enlargement, right atrial enlargement, trace aortic
insufficiency, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation,
with severe pulmonary hypertension.  4.  She has a history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone and Coumadin.
5.  History of pulmonary embolism in [**2117**].  6.  History of
thyroidectomy on Synthroid.  7.  History of chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline of 1.1.  8.  History of


osteoporosis.  9.  Depression and anxiety.  Borderline
personality disorder.  10.  Sleep apnea.  11.  Peripheral
vascular disease.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN CAUSES A RASH.  PERCOCET ALSO CAUSES
RASH.  TEGRETOL CAUSES LIVER ABNORMALITIES.  SHE IS ALLERGIC

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone.  She has occasional alcohol
use.  She denied tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  She had a father who died of myocardial
infarction at 47 and mother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.9??????, pulse
51, blood pressure 84/25, respirations 10, oxygen saturation
100% on room air.  General:  She was a pleasant, pale, female
in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements full.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple.  There was
an 11 cm JVP.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  There was a 3 out
of 6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border and at the
right upper sternal border.  Abdomen:  Soft, slightly
distended, obese, nontender.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  She
also had guaiac positive brown stool.  No evidence of blood.
Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis, but she had 3+ pitting
edema in both lower extremities.  Neurological:  She was
alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 6.4,
hematocrit 19.8, platelet count 221,000; INR 4.0, PT 24.6,
PTT 45.0; sodium 128, potassium 4.8, bicarb 88, chloride 26,
BUN 149, creatinine 2.7, glucose 154.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  She was a 67-year-old female with a
history of coronary artery disease, and congestive heart
failure, with multiple admissions, atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin and Amiodarone, diabetes type 2, peripheral vascular
disease, and hyperthyroidism, presenting with worsening
congestive heart failure symptoms and anemia, as well as
elevated BUN and creatinine ratio, and anemia with a
hematocrit of 19.8.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient had an exam consistent with
congestive heart failure.  We will place a Swan-Ganz to
assess .............. possibility once her elevated INR has
been decreased.  We will give her Vitamin K.

2.  Hematocrit:  The patient has had over a ten-point
hematocrit drop with negative guaiac positive stool.  We were
planning to transfuse her.  After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
we decided not to place an NG tube because of elevated INR
and the fear of aspiration.

3.  Endocrine:  She has a history of hyperthyroidism on
Synthroid.

4.  Renal:  She has had worsening renal function with an
increase in creatinine.  We will continue to diurese anyway
and hope that with improved cardiac output, the patient's
renal function will improve.

5.  GI:  We will reverse her INR with Vitamin K and start
Protonix at 40 mg IV q.d.  We will also consult GI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  The patient's INR was
reversed with Vitamin K, and a Swan was placed.  Swan numbers
revealed pulmonary artery hypertension but also an elevated
wedge felt to be due to left heart failure due to diastolic
dysfunction.  Echocardiogram was done which showed an
ejection fraction of 55%.  The patient was diuresed with
Lasix, and throughout the hospital course, lost 10 kg with
complete resolution of her 3+ lower extremity pitting edema.
She remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the hospital
course.  Her pulse was in the 50s and 60s throughout but
stable.  Once her heart failure resolved, she was restarted
on her home medications, Lopressor 25 b.i.d.  Lisinopril was
decreased to 10 mg q.d., and she was restarted on Lasix 120
mg q.d.  She was also restarted on Aspirin and placed on
Lipitor per her home regimen.  She was continued on
Amiodarone and restarted on Coumadin after a negative GI
work-up.

Pulmonary:  The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension on
echocardiogram but has a history of PE.  She had negative
lower extremity Dopplers recently, so this was not repeated.
At the time of discharge, the patient had good oxygen
saturations on room air.

Renal:  Her renal function improved throughout the hospital
stay with diuresis.  Creatinine returned to baseline of 1.1.

GI:  EGD found erosions in the antrum that were small and
localized.  There was no active bleeding or coffee-grounds
and no evidence of recent GI bleed.  The patient later had a
barium study with small bowel follow through which was a
unremarkable small bowel study; barium passed freely through
the small bowel reaching the cecum within 45 min.  The small
bowel was of normal caliber in the mucosal pattern, no mass
lesions.  Terminal ileum and cecum appeared normal.

Heme:  The patient was transfused multiple units of packed
red blood cells.  Hematocrit eventually stabilized around 31
with no evidence of further bleeding.  The patient was
restarted on her Coumadin, as well as Aspirin without
incident.

DISPOSITION:  The patient saw Physical Therapy who
recommended a short rehabilitation stay of several days with
a plan to follow-up with Heart Failure Service on [**10-5**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 120 mg q.d., Lopressor 25 mg
b.i.d., Lisinopril 10 mg q.d., Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s. q.o.d.,
2.5 mg q.o.d. q.h.s., Zantac 150 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg
