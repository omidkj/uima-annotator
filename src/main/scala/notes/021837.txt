History of Present Illness:
83 year old woman with a history of recently diagnosed
diverticulosis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and
temporal arteritis who presents from OSH with brisk bleeding
from rectum since 8:30 PM [**2173-7-20**]. Her last normal BM was that
morning, and her last meal was 7:00pm that day. Reportedly
passed ~1L BRBPR. Associated syncopal episode at [**Hospital 2725**]
hospital. She has also had LLQ pain for the past several weeks
that prompted a CT 4 weeks ago that reportedly revealed the
diverticulosis. At the OSH ED, her BP was initially 100/50 P in
60's.. Hematocrit 31 (at 10pm on [**2173-7-20**]). She received 2 units
pRBC. Because she continued to have brisk bleeding from her
rectum, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management
while the second unit was running.
In ED at [**Hospital1 18**], BP intially 192/70, though was as high as
235/79--both in setting of nausea, P 76 but became bradycardic
-- she was noted to have continued BRBPR and hematocrit returned
at 24.5. An NG lavage was attempted but the patient became
bradycardic & vomitted (brown emesis, no frank blood) during
this procedure. P returned to [**Location 213**] spontaneously. Through the
ED course she continued to have brisk bleeding Her BP ranged
downward to the 100-110 range, P unchanged. Pt passed total of
800cc of BRBPR, 2 additional pRBC were given. She was also given
4 units of platelets because she was reported to be on plavix.
It was decided to send the patient to IR urgently for
embolization.
.
On further questioning, the patient reports she has never had
BRBPR. She does not recall ever having a colonoscopy.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old woman with diverticulosis, hypertension, and [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH with LGIB. On admission, pt had placement
of 3 large bore IVs, pt was typed and screened. She had active
bleeding in cecum detected on angiography ([**2173-7-21**]). HD1, pt
successfully underwent embolization of ileocolic branch of SMA
per interventional radiology.  Pt was transferred to the MICU in
hemodynamically stable condition, Hct 26.6.  She initially c/o
nausea and abdominal pain, but symptoms resolved over time.  Hct
trended down over 24hrs, with Hct 24.5 on [**2173-7-22**], and 1u pRBCs
was given.  GI was consulted, and recommended outpatient f/u
with appt on [**2173-8-24**] for possible colonoscopy.
Pt was transferred to a regular medical floor on HD 2 after
stable HCT for 48 hours and having been hemodynamically stable.
She was transfused 1 unit PRBC's with appropriately increased
HCT to 30.1. She had not had a BM since embolization. HD 4 had
BM w/small amount BRBPR early in AM. HCTs stable at 30.9. Pt was
monitored for 48 hours after with stable HCT. Repeat BM on day
prior to discharge was with brown stool. Pt did not have signs
of bowel ischemia during this admission. Her plavix was held to
be restarted outpt.
.
With regard to her hypertension: Pt was hypertensive with SBP in
180s on arrival to MICU.  Home BP meds held initially due to
concern for bleeding, but she was restarted on home Cozaar,
Clonidine, and Norvasc with good response.  Atenolol was
initially held.  EKG and cardiac enzymes did not suggest a
cardiovascular event.
Atenolol was restarted on HD 4 after pt was hemodynamically
stable throughout hospitalization and continued to be
hypertensive.
.
With regard to her Bradycardia: At OSH, pt was reported to have
become bradycardic during NG tube placement, likely due to vagal
reaction. She did not have any episodes of bradycardia during
this hospitalization.
.
With regard to her Acidosis: Plasma bicarbonate was 16
initially, likely due to GI loss and aggressive colloid and
crystalloid resuscitation (high salt load).  Resolved HD 3.
.
With regard to her baseline Anemia, normocytic: chronic causes
likely from CRI and/or anemia of chronic disease on epo
outpatient. Monitored HCT, transfused as above.
.
With regard to her CKD: Cr 1.7 trended down to pt's baseline Cr
of 1.4 with transfusion and IVF.
.
With regard to her Temporal Arteritis: After embolization
procedure, pt was placed on fludrocortisone to substitute her
home prednisone regiment.  She was switched back to home
prednisone 5mg po on [**2173-7-22**] and continued on this regiimen
during the rest of her hospitalization.
