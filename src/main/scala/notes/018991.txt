Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
Right flank pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
45 yo man with HIV/AIDS (last CD4 7 in [**10/2110**]) presenting with
right lower thorax, pain for last 4-5 days. Pain is sharp,
pleuritic, non-radiating. No diarrhea, hematuria, dysuria.
Patient endorses decreased oral intake in last 5 to 6 days,
though it is not clear why. Also with subjective fevers and
chills relieved by acetaminophen. Also with headache in last
week. History notably absent for any cough, sputum production,
dyspnea, and chest pain. Was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**11-13**] to [**11-15**]
for hypotension and fever attributed to PCP pneumonia as patient
was thought to be non-compliant with prescribed treatment
course. Was discharged on [**11-15**] with planned course of prednisone
and Bactrim ending on [**11-21**], which he states he did take. He
also states that shortly after discharge he had an episode of
similar pleuritic chest pain and was evaluated in the ED (not at
[**Hospital1 **]) and told everything was ok, after which the pain resolved.
The pain then recurred. He denies other associated symptoms
including cough, sob, fevers, chills, doe, leg swelling, nausea,
vomitting, sore throat, myalgias, arthralgias. He denies sick
contacts, lives alone, has not travelled. He has worked a few
shifts at a gas station but denies being exposed to ill contacts
via this. He is not fully aware of the names of his medications,
and likely was not taking all of them but does claim to at least
be taking some of them (see medication section for details). He
does not recall taking bactrim at a ppx dose after completing
treatment in [**Month (only) **]. He did receive a seasonal influenza
vaccine, though did not get vaccinated for H1N1. Currently his
pain is improved from presentation, rated [**2111-4-13**], for which he
does not want medication.

Upon presentation to the ED: T 99.4, HR 89, BP 123/73, RR 18,
O2Sat 98% RA. CXR was concerning for multilobar pneumonia and
thus patient was given Bactrim DS three tabs, prednisone 40 mg
PO, Vancomycin 1 g IV, Cefepime 1 g IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV.
EKG was intially concerning for lateral ST segment elevations in
setting of slight trop rise to 0.02 and thus cardiology was
called. They felt EKG consistent with J-point elevation and trop
likely attributable to decreased renal clearance. Patient was
initially destined for medical floor bed and was seen by
admitting hospitalist who was worried about tachypnea to 30s and
thus patient was deemed to need ICU level of care. Vitals prior
to transfer to the ICU were: HR 82, BP 128/68, RR 30, O2Sat 96%
RA.

In the ICU he remained stable, with mild tachypnea but no
respiratry distress. He was continued on broad spectrum
antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin,
osteltamivir, and bactrim. He had a flu swab and an induced
sputum, but not until [**2110-12-13**] am.

ROS: + for frontal HA without photophobia, meningismus or
confusion for 10 days, constipation intermittently without blood
or melena, last bm today, and rash on left arm since [**10-17**],
unchanged, but otherwise negative except as noted above.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo M with HIV/AIDS (last CD4 7 in [**10/2110**]) presenting with
right flank pain for last three days.

#. Pneumonia: Radiographically impressive, and likely his
pleuritic chest pain co-relates with his infection. He is at
high risk for recurrence of PJP given was not taking his
prophylactic Bactrim and may or may not be compliant with his
HAART and known to have very low CD4 (LDH also very elevated c/w
PJP). Additionally at risk for CAP and was hospitalized within
the past month so HAP. Was initially on broad spectrum
antibiotics (including cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
oseltamivir). ID was consulted for assistance with management.
DFA for flu was negative and oseltamivir was discontinued.
Cefepime and vancomycin were also discontinued as he improved
(and in the absence of any discovered bacterial etiologies). He
will complete a 7 day course of levofloxacin for
community-acquired pneumonia. He will continue on Bactrim until
[**1-2**] along with a prednisone taper (40mg [**Hospital1 **] through [**12-17**], 40mg
daily through [**12-22**], and 20mg daily through [**1-2**]).

#. Right chest pain: Pleuritic, likley related to acute
infection. Improved with treatment of pneumonia.

#. HIV/AIDS: Recent CD4 of 7 ([**2110-10-31**]). High risk for OI,
likely not taking [**Month/Day/Year 33337**] as prescribed including HAART and
prophylaxis. He was continued on his home regimen of
Atazanavir, Ritonavir, Tenofovir, and Zidovudine. Prophylactic
azithromycin and itraconazole were continued, and he will
require Bactrim prophylactically once he completes his treatment
course.

#. CKD: stage III, at recent baseline, monitor, renally dose
[**Month/Day/Year 33337**].

#. Leukopenia: not neutropenic, stable, likley related to HIV
vs. medications.

#. Anemia: normocytic, at recent baseline though this is
relatively new for him. Guaiac negative
