Attending:[**Known firstname 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
59yo male with history of HIV and CAD s/p NSTEMI and CABG in
[**2136**] presenting with 40 minutes of pressure beginning at 8pm
this evening while at rest. Pt reports he had just taken his
evening meds when he felt aching and tingling in his left thump
that then progressed up his arm to his shoulder and transitioned
into chest pressure. No SOB/Diaphoesis/N/V. This was different
then his previous episodes of chest pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.5, HR 73, BP 155/84, RR 16,
Sat 100%.  EKG suggested an inferior MI, so a code-STEMI was
called and he was taken to the cath lab. Got integrillin heparin
aspirin plavix. BMS was placed in the SVG to PDA. Some
bradycardia during case, got atropine once. Recovered.

Cardiac CATH [**10-5**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel
disease. The
LAD had sequential 70-80& stenoses in the mid-distal portion of
the
vessel. The circumflex artery had a long proximal 80% stenosis.
The
right coronary arteyr was proximally occluded proximal to the
vein graft
touchdown.
2. Selective conduit angiography demonstrated that the LIMA-LAD
was
patent. The SVG to the ramus was patent. The SVG to the PDA was
occluded
with what appears to be fresh clot. The SVG to OM1 was patent
with an
80% stenosis near the touchdwon.
3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrate systemic normotension.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. STEMI s/p thrombectomy

[**2140-10-6**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to moderate hypokinesis of the
inferior wall and mild hypokinesis of the posterior wall. There
is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared to prior study (pre-CABG) of [**2137-1-9**], the left
ventricular ejection fraction is increased. Apical
hypokinesis/akinesis is no longer present.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 59 YO HIV positive gentleman with history of
CABG in [**2136**] presenting to ED with acute onset left arm pain and
chest pressure found to have STEMI secondary to occulsion of SVG
to PDA. Had cardiac cath, s/p PTCI with placement of BMS. Pt
transfered to the CCU for close monitoring.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient underwent cardiac cathterization with
placement of BMS in SVG to PDA. CP free on the floor with
resolution of EKG fidnings and stable in the CCU. He was started
on aspirin and his plavix was transitioned to plasugrel.
Integrillin was continued for 18h post cath. There was initial
concern about interactions between his HAART and atorvastain.
Pharmacy was consulted they did not feel interaction was an
issue. His home statin was continued. He was switched from
plavix to prasugrel on day 2 and after receiving a loading dose
of 60mg was maintained on 10mg daily. His BB and ACE-I were
initially held secondary to hypotension during the procedure.
His was eventually restarted on metoprolol and lisinopril. At
discharge he was taking 25mg metoprolol XL, 5 mg lisinopril,
81mg Aspirin, 10mg Prasugrel and 80 mg atorvastatin.
.
# PUMP: Evidence of hypokinesis in [**2136**]. An echo the morning
following his procedure showed demonstrated similar findings of
LVH hypokinesis and an EF of 40% which was unchanged from [**2136**].


# HIV: He was continued on his HAART for the duration of his
stay. After consultation with pharmacy his statin dose was
continued.

# PUD: Continued omeprazole
.
# Guiac positive stool: On morning of discharge patient reported
dark stool. This was found to be guiac positive. Pt has been
taking Iron supplements and has had a stable hematocrit
throughout his hospital course. An acute bleeding event was
thought to be unlikely. However given his history of PUD this
should be investigated further as an outpatient. Pt encouraged
to discuss this with his PCP.
.
# Depression: Continued citalopram
.
# Peripheral neuropathy: Continued neurontin
