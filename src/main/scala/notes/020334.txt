Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 40 year old right handed female pediatrician
with past medical history of metastatic breast cancer with known

brain mets who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2152-8-8**] with altered
mental status and seizure activity.

Normally gets care at [**University/College **] Hitchock. Patient diagnosed with

locally advanced left breast cancer in [**2150**]. Staging showed
large
ill defined cancer in left breast along with lymphadenopathy.
Biopsy with 2.2 high grade ductal carcinoma with invasion.
Underwent lymph node dissection and adjuvant chemotherapy
[**2150-8-8**]. Underwent mastectomy [**12-30**]. Cerebellar met discovered
[**5-30**]. Surgically resected followed by radiotherapy. Pulmonary
and
mediastinal mets [**7-1**]. Progessive brain mets noted [**10-1**] and
underwent whole brain XRT [**10-31**] with some regression. Routine
follow up scan [**6-1**] with interval increase in brain mets.
Asymptomatic at that time, but over past one month, apparently
has had episodes of wavy lines in her vision. Started on [**Doctor Last Name **]
AUC 6/docetaxel q3 weeks, with 4 infusions thus far, last on
Thursday [**2152-8-3**].

She was in [**Location (un) 86**] today shopping with a friend. Around 11:30 am,

friend reports that she complained of the wavy lines in her
vision. Then ate lunch okay and accompanied friend to friend's
doctor's appointment on [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]. While there, complained of
nausea in the waiting room. Friend went to see doctor. When she
came out, patient looked glazed over, was unable to get up out
of
chair, ?due to weakness. Friend went to get car while [**Hospital Ward Name **]
staff helped patient into wheelchair and took her down to lobby.

When friend pulled up, patient was reportedly unresponsive.

Transferred to ED. After arrival to ED, noted to have several
minutes of bilateral tonic clonic movements of the extremities
with eye deviation up to the left. Associated with stool
incontinence. Given 2 mg Ativan. Afterwards, reportedly opened
eyes, but never conversant, did not follow commands. Noted to
have persistent tonic extension of her left arm per ED staff.

About 30 minutes later, had second seizure with left eye
deviation and left face and eye rhythmic twitching. Witnessed by

me. Extremities flaccid at time. Unresponsive. Given another 2
mg
Ativan. Loaded with 1 gram Dilantin. Given 10 mg Decadron IV.

Head CT with multiple areas of vasogenic edema concerning for
mets with minimal mass effect, no midline shift, no signs of
herniation, no hemorrhage.

Upon reasssessment 30 minutes later, patient remained
unresponsive and flaccid. No withdrawal to pain. Code status
confirmed with husband. [**Name (NI) 227**] another 4 mg Ativan and then
intubated for depressed mental status and inability to protect
airway.

Thirty minutes post intubation was fight ETT, gagging and
withdrawing to pain. Bolused with additional 500 mg IV Dilantin
while in ED.

CT head [**2152-8-7**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage. There are multiple areas of vasogenic edema in the
frontal lobes bilaterally, in the occipital lobes bilaterally,
and more subtle regions within the parietal lobes and left
cerebellum. There are subtle soft tissue attenuation nodules,
isodense to the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, seen centered in these areas, best

seen on series 2, image 20 and series 2, image 19. There are
several areas of loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation, most
prominently in the left frontal lobe. These findings in this
patient with history of breast cancer are likely consistent with

metastatic disease. There is local mass effect in the areas of
vasogenic edema but no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no hydrocephalus. The cisterns and sulci are preserved.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen
within the osseous structures. IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of
vasogenic edema, with a suggestion of soft tissue nodules
centered within these areas; these findings are likely
consistent
with metastatic disease in this patient with known breast
cancer.
Followup MRI is recommended for confirmation. There is no
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, or evidence of impending herniation.

PET scan [**2152-5-31**]: Multiple new hypermetabolic lesions in the
bilateral posterior occipital lobes, midline infrathalamic
region, and at least three regions in the left cerebellar
hemisphere. Suspicious small focus in the right pedicle of L3,
possibly on the left side of L3 body. Likely benign healing rib

fracture in left anterior second rib.

MRI Scan [**2152-3-28**]: Multiple metastases including left frontal
ares, left posterior cerebellar.

EEG - [**2152-8-9**] - preliminary findings show no epileptiform
activity, finalized report pending at the time of d/c.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 40 year old right handed woman with past medical
history of metastatic breast cancer with known brain mets who
presents to [**Hospital1 18**] after having generalized tonic clonic seizure
followed by focal seizure of left face. No return to lucid
baseline in between events and failure to return to lucid
baseline in appropriate time frame after second seizure.
Necessitated increased doses of Ativan as well intubation for
airwary protection. Now with grimacing and localization on exam
so less concern for persistent seizure activity. CT head with
multiple areas of vasogenic edema consistent with mets but no
hemorrhage, midline shift, mass effect.

She was admitted to the Neuro ICU for further monitoring.  The
patient had no further seizure activity in the ICU.  [**8-9**] the
patient was extubated without difficulty.  She had an EEG that
was found to be negative for subclincal seizures.  Her dilantin
level remained therapeutic at 15.  An MRI study was deferred as
the patient care was assumed by her primary oncologist in New
[**Location (un) **].  She was d/c to home with prescriptions for dilantin
and decadron.  Arrangements were made to have the patient follow
with her oncologist upon discharge.
