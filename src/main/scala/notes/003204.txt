Pertinent Results:
[**2144-1-5**] Echo: Normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity
size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic regurgitation. A well-seated
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large, partically echofilled pericardial effusion
most prominent inferlateral to the left ventricle (2-2.6cm). The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Large loculated ?bloody
pericardial effusion most prominent along the inferolateral wall
of the left ventricle and anterior to the right ventricle but
without echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Mildly depressed
global left ventricular systolic function. Well seated
bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement with no mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2143-9-8**], the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller and
appears more loculated. Global left ventricular systolic
function is now lower, and the patient is now in atrial
fibrillation. The mitral valve has been replaced.
.
[**2144-1-6**] Chest CT: 1. Status post mitral valve replacement and
Maze procedure with expected appearance of the mitral valve and
left atrium. 2. Small left and small-to-moderate right pleural
effusion. Substantial atelectasis of the left lower lobe, with
no evidence of central compression with not re-expanding left
lung and substantial left mediastinal shift. 3. Evidence of
substantial pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2144-1-6**] Lower Ext. U/S: Left and right subclavian veins are
patent with normal flow and compressibility. Left internal
jugular vein is patent with normal flow and normal
compressibility. There is normal compression and augmentation of
the left axillary, left brachial, left basilic, and left
cephalic veins.
.
[**2144-1-7**] Echo: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a large pericardial effusion. No
right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery. Post evacuation\window: no effusion, otherwise no
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yr old s/p MVR/MAZE on [**12-13**] discharged to rehab on [**12-21**]. She
returned from rehab to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-1-4**] with complaints of chest
pain associated with hypotension. TEE showed loculated
pericardial effusion. On [**1-7**] she underwent  pericardial window
via left anterior thoracotomy. In [**Name (NI) 13042**] PT was not able to be
extubated due to low o2 and high CO2. She was therefore
transferred to CVICU vented on Neo gtt and bilateral [**Doctor Last Name **]
drains. She eventually extubated and was transferred to floor
the following day, CTs' were removed prior to transfer. The
following day while on the floor she became hypoxic and CXR
revealed large left effusion with collapse. She was therfore
transferred back to the CVICU for care. Left pigtail placed by
IP for drainage of effusion and she required reintubation for
left lower lobe collapse. She was bronched and mucus plug was
extracted. She was rebronched the following day with improvement
in lung findings. However she remained intubated for several
days longer due to continued tachypnea and SOB.  She eventually
self extubated on [**1-13**] and continued an 8 day course of
antibiotics for VAP coverage. She also received a short course
of steroids for possible reactive airway disease. She remained
hemodynaically stable. TTE revaled that she was underfilled  and
was transfused to optimize her BP. During her ICU stay she was
in rapid afib and was started on amiodarone for rate contol. At
times she bacame bradycardic into the 30's therefore her
lopressor was adjusted. She was seen by speach and swallow and
was placed on modified diet for mild swallowing difficulties
regular with nectar thick. She was restarted on anticoagulation
for her a-fib with goal INR 20-2.5. Once
