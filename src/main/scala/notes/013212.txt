History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female, lives at home, d/c'd from rehab 5 days ago, with
pmh of afib on coumadin, CHF (EF 35%), rectal cancer s/p
resection in [**2178**], presents BRBPR x 10 days, along with R arm
bruising and L buttock bruising. Per patient, it began at rehab.
VNA stopped coumadin 2 days ago per the daughter. When her
daughter found out she had been bleeding she was brought to ED.

Of note, had recent admissions in [**10-16**] for appendicitis with
abscess and in [**11-15**] for RLL pneumonia, and was at rehab until 5
days ago after the PNA admission. She denies abdominal pain,
chest pain, and has baseline shortness of breath which is
unchanged. She feels tired but otherwise has no complaints.
.
In the ED, vital signs were stable. Her INR was 6.4. Hct 23.5,
slightly below basline of 26-28. Troponin 0.07 is at baseline
and ECG unchanged from prior. She was given Vitamin K 10mg IV
x1, 2 units FFP with 20mg IV lasix inbetween, IV protonix 40mg
x1, and was ordered for 2 units PRBCs which were begun in the
ICU. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. Upon
arrival to the ICU, her VS were stable (BP 130/80, HR 100), and
she had a medium maroon stool.

CXR [**2190-12-13**]:
Severe cardiomegaly has worsened slightly, pulmonary vasculature
is distinctly more dilated and early interstitial edema may be
developing, all consistent with cardiac decompensation.
Mediastinal veins are dilated to a stable degree. Pleural
effusion if any is small. No pneumothorax. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15259**] and I
discussed these findings, at the time of dictation.
.
[**2190-11-8**] ECHO:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with inferior
and infero-lateral hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect with borderline normal
free wall function. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-10-9**],
the findings are similar (the LVEF was slightly underestimated
on prior study).


Brief Hospital Course:
Hct was found to be 23.5 from BL of ~ 26-28. INR was 6.4. ECG
was unchanged and CEs were negative. SHe received 2 units of
FFP, 10 mg of IV vit K, and 20 mg of IV lasix and was admitted
to the ICU for close monitoring.  Upon arrival to the ICU,
patient SBPs continued to be stable. Her beta blocker was
initially held but then had a episode of AFib into the 120s and
received 25 mg of oral metoprolol.  She received 2 units PRBCs
with 20 mg of IV lasix with each transfusion. Hct 23.5-> 28.2->
31. INR this am 6.4-> 1.4. At 7 am this morning, patient had
recurrent episode of AF with RVR and became acutely SOB. CXR c/w
pulmonary edema. She received 5 mg of IV lopressor, 50 mg po
lopressor, and 40 mg of IV lasix with good UOP and improved SOB.
GI was consulted and came to evaluate patient.  However, patient
refused all endoscopy.  She had 1 maroon stool last night but no
further bleeding. This am, her diet was advanced to clears.
.
# BRBPR:  Most likely LGIB. Brisk upper GI bleed also considered
although less likely given hemodynamic stability. Etiologies of
lower GIB include recurrence of colon cancer, diverticulosis,
ulcer at anastomosis site, AVM, ischemic colitis.  Complicated
by supratherapeutic INR. No further bleeding now with INR
reversed. Hct stable following transfusion. Patient refusing
endoscopy. Favoring conservative management. PPI was
discontinued as bleed was thought most likely lower in origin.
Her coumadin was not restarted after long discussion with
patient's daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] aspirin was held until the day of
discharge.
.
# supratherapeutic INR: in setting of coumadin administration.
Corrected now after vit K and FFP. LFTs normal. Her INR remained
subtherapeutic throughout hospitalization after reversal.
.
# Afib: long history of PAF although only recently initiated
coumadin after hospital admission in 11/[**2189**]. Followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of Cardiology. Due to episodes of RVR at times of
agitation while on the hospital floors beta blocker was
uptitrated to 75 mg TID.  HRs improved to 70s and BP tolerated.
She was transitioned to Toprol XL 200 mg daily at the time of
discharge. Long discussion held with family regarding risks and
benefits or reinitiating coumadin. It was explained that this
bleed was in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and that she
may not have any bleeding with INRs in the goal range of [**1-11**].
Risks of holding coumadin also discussed with daughter including
risk of stroke as well as risk of embolization to organs and
other tissues given known aortic thrombus at high risk of
embolization.  Patient's daughter remained convinced that she
would not want her mother reinitiated on coumadin and so this
medication was held.  On the day of dischage a full dose aspirin
was restarted. She was scheduled for Cardiology follow up as an
outpatient.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2176**]. ECG unchanged and CEs negative despite
GIB and RVR. She remained asymptomatic throughout admission.
Aspirin was initially held in the setting of GI bleed but was
restarted at the time of discharge.  After stabilization of GI
bleed, she was restarted on her beta blocker and ace inhibitor.
She was continued on her statin throughout.
.
# thoracic aortic mural plaque: Found incidentally on recent CT
abdomen. At high risk of embolism according to radiology read.
As above, patient and family refusing systemic anticoagulation.
.
# Asymmetric LE swelling:  L>R. Noted on admission and persisted
despite
