chest CT without clear cause of pain. Pt reports last drink
afternoon of [**2102-9-28**]. He has been drinking about 1L of liquor

In the ED, the pt was afebrile, hypertensive (220's/110's), and
tachycardic (HR up to 140's). He was given a total of 14mg of
ativan for withdrawal, along with some morphine. He was started
on a nitro gtt to help control his BP. However, his BP was still
difficult to control despite nitro gtt. Pt denied HA/vision
changes. No weakness/numbness. for placed on a CIWA scale. His
tox screen was positive for alcohol with a level of 68 and
benzos. His first set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
.
Pt was admitted to the MICU for close monitoring of his blood
pressure with a nitro gtt and placed on CIWA scale. The CIWA
scale was tightened given pt had high use of Valium thought to

before call-out and Lisinopril titrated up.
