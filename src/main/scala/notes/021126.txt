Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Left lower extremity swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement ([**2126-9-12**])

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3069**] is a 71 year old male with a history of metastatic
melanoma to brain, lung and liver s/p ten sessions of cranial
radiation in [**Month (only) 205**] who presented to outpatient oncology clinic
for a scheduled appointment this morning and noted for the past
three days that he has had left lower extremity swelling.  He
does not have pain in his leg although this leg has felt heavy
for the past 2 months which prompted his initial CT scan which
diagnosed his brain metastases.  He has not had any fevers,
chills, chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain.  He does have left
sided leg weakness but this has been stable.  All other review
of systems negative in detail.  He was referred to the emergency
room directly from oncology clinic for evaluation of potential
DVT.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 94.1 P: 90 BP: 120/80 R: 18 O2
sat 100% on RA.  He had a left lower extremity ultrasound which
was positive for DVT.  He had a CTA which was preliminarily
negative for pulmonary embolism.  He had a non-contrast CT of
the head which showed three hemorrhagic metastases (unclear how
these compare in size post-radiation).  Given findings on CT
head he was not started on anticogulation.  He was seen by
vascular surgery for consideration of IVC filter.  He was also
seen by neurosurgery, official recommendations pending.  He was
transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.
.
On arrival to the ICU he has no specific complaints.  Left lower
extremity weakness is unchanged.  He denies other numbness,
tingling, weakness, fatigue, leg pain.  No blurry vision.  Gait
has been unstable since diagnosis of metastatic lesions.  He
endorses 10 lb weight loss over past two months.  All other
review of systems negative.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS: 1. Small right subsegmental pulmonary
embolism in the right posterior lower lobe pulmonary artery, no
dissection or aortic aneurysm. 2. Large left upper lobe soft
tissue mass with pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe and
left lower lobe as described. 3. Probable metastasis in the
spleen.
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST ([**2126-9-11**]) Multifocal high-attenuation foci
with the perilesional vasogenic edema, in setting of known
metastases suspicious for hemorrhagic intracranial metastases.
If further evaluation is desired, please consider
gadolinium-enhanced MRI. No prior comparisons available to
assess for change.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT ([**2126-9-11**]) Extensive DVT in the left
lower extremity extending from common femoral vein to posterior
tibial veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with a history of metastatic melanoma to brain,
lung and liver who presents with a left lower extremity DVT.
.
# LLE DVT and small PE: DVT found in LLE with small subsegmental
PE, but patient also has hemorrhagic brain metastases shown on
head CT preventing anticoagulation.  Vascular was consulted,
recommended IVC filter placement if primary team decided against
anticoagulation.  Patient has an extensive clot burden in the
LLE, but anticoagulation was held in light of the hemorrhagic
potential of the brain metastasis.  IVC filter was placed by IR
on [**2126-9-12**]. Pt tolerated procedure well without complications.
He was ambulatory the next day.
.
# Metastatic Melanoma: Hemorrhagic brain metastasis with
surrounding vasogenic edema demonstrated on CT head.  Patient is
s/p 10 sessions of XRT.  On admission to ICU neurologic exam was
notable for left lower extremity weakness and decreased
reflexes.  Neuro exams were performed every 4 hours.  Pt was
continued on home dose decadron 4 mg TID.  Neurosurgery was
consulted and left decision re: anti-coagulation to the primary
team.
.
# Steroid Induced Hyperglycemia:  Patient is usually on oral
agents and long acting insulin at home, but these were held
while patient was NPO.  RISS was used for glycemic control with
good results.
.
# Hypercalcemia: Likely related to malignancy. Pt's latest
albumin of 3.9.  Given 1 L IVF, calcium monitored with decrease
to 9.0 at time of discharge.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Latest platelet count 93K.  Baseline
platelet count unknown. Also likely related to malignancy.  No
evidence of bleeding.  Platelets monitored with plt of 101 at
discharge.
.
# Hypertension:  Patient was continued on home dose of
lisinopril
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Patient was continued on home dose of
simvastatin
.
# Code: Full (discussed with patient)
