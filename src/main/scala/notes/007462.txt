Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
hyperkalemia, bradycardia, and pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 49 yo Spanish Speaking only male with h/o CAD s/p
CABG, DM, ESRD secondary to DM on HD, HTN, HL, cardiomyopathy EF
25% from Chagas, and pancreatitis who presented to the ED this
AM c/o acute onset of epigastric pain radiating to back
yesterday with 2 episodes of non bloody emesis. He reports his
pain started in the afternoon after eating a [**Location (un) 6002**] and was
[**6-17**] constant sharp pain overnight. He had associated anixety
and chills. Yesterday he reports any air hitting his body caused
pain.  He also had one episode of watery non bloody diarrhea
last night.  He denies any other associated sx. Pertinent
negatives were no CP, SOB, jaw pain, arm pain, back pain, or
shoulder pain. He was not able to answer whether this pain is
consistent with previous episodes of pancreatitis.

Vitals on arrival to the ED were 98.4 166/73 62 16 100% RA. In
the ED intial labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 6.8
(hemolyzed), hyponatremia to 132, gap 18, lipase 196, trop of
0.12. He receiced calcium gluconate 1g Iv, 10 units of insulin,
and an amp of D5. His K was 5.8 at recheck and the 6.9. He
received 4 IV morphine, 4 IV zofran, and O.5mg of IV dilaudid
with improvement of his pain.   While in the [**Name (NI) **] pt became
bradycardic to 41 and was found to have a new partial RBBB with
RVR in v1 and v2, new flipped t wave inversions in v1/v2/aVL,
and PR prolongation in the setting of his bradycardia.
Cardiology was consulted and bradycardia and EKG changes could
be explained by his hyperkalemia. HR improved to the 60s while
in the ED without further intervemtion.
A CT of the abd with IV contrast was done due to his severe abd
pain and showed fat stranding of the pancreas c/w possible
pancreatitis, trace gall bladder edema, and no evidence of
aortic deissection or AAA. The bases of his lungs showed small
bilateral pleural effusion improved compared to prior. Pt was
guiac negative on exam with epigastric and tenderness in the
right and left upper quadrant. A CXR showed small pleural
effusions bilaterally and cardiomegaly similar to prior study.
Vitals on transfer were 98 64 174/93 16 99% RA.

On arrival to the ICU vitals were T98.4 BP166/77 HR62 RR18 100%
RA. He reports a small amount of abdominal pain but better
compared to the ED. He has no other complaints.

STUDIES:
[**2124-4-24**] EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm. Incomplete right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific
ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing heart
rate is
increased and is now sinus rhythm.

[**2124-4-24**] CXR:
Small bilateral pleural effusions, stable. Stable cardiomegaly.

[**2124-4-24**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or abdominal aortic
aneurysm.
2. Trace fat-stranding about the tail of the pancreas. Given the
patient's
elevated lipase, this finding is compatible with acute
pancreatitis. No focal fluid collections.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. Trace
gallbladder wall edema is likely secondary to acute
pancreatitis.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusion.

[**2124-4-25**] CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, today's upright AP
radiograph confirms the presence of mild right-sided pleural
effusion. On the left, no effusion is seen. Unchanged status
post sternotomy with unchanged appearance of the cardiac
silhouette. No hilar or mediastinal changes. No focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

[**2124-4-27**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. ST-T wave abnormalities with borderline prolonged
QTc interval are non-specific but cannot exclude possible
drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect or possible myocardial
ischemia. Since the previous tracing of [**2124-4-24**] incomplete right
bundle-branch block is now absent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 yo Spanish Speaking only male with h/o CAD
s/p CABG, DM, ESRD secondary to DM on HD, HTN, HL,
cardiomyopathy EF 25% from Chagas, and pancreatitis who presents
with hyperkalemia with associated EKG changes (bradycardia & PR
prolongation), pancreatitis, and new partial RBBB.
.
# New partial right bundle: Has h/o CAD and CABG. Trop elevated
to 0.12-0.14, but CK remained flat. Elevated trop more likely
related to CKD. The patient was continued on his home ASA,
statin, fenofibrate, ACEi. BB was restarted after bradycardia
improved. Chart review showed it has been intermittently present
in the past.

# Bradycardia: Seen by cardiology in the ED, who felt that
bradycardia is related to the hyperkalemia. Pt remained
asymptomatic. The bradycardia resolved after dialysis.

# Hyperkalemia: Unclear etiology - has only very occasional
hyperkalemia when reviewing the records, despite being on HD. Pt
received calcium gluconate, insulin 10 IV x1 and 1 amp of glc in
the ED. Infectious w/u has been negative to date. K improved
with dialysis and has remained WN
