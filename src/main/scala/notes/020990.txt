.
On arrival to the ER she was tachycardic to 150s, BP 60/P, RR 34
02 99% NRB with temp of 94.1. Right groin line was placed and IV
fluids were given. Throughout the hospital course the patient
was noted to be intermittently hypotensive with SBPs 88-114. She
was persistently tachycardic and temperature increased from 34.5
to 36.8. She was given 10 Units regular insulin and started on a
gtt at 7 U/hr. 1 gram vancomycin, 2 grams ceftriaxone and 750 mg
levofloxacin were given as well as 40 mEQ potassium.


Past Medical History:

compliance, last A1c [**12-26**]: 13.3%
2. Hypercholesterolemia
3. Pancreatitis
4. HTN
5. GERD
6. Anemia, baseline hct 30
7. nonischemic mild [**Last Name (LF) 19874**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 40-45% [(-) cath in [**2149**]]
.


Social History:
Lives with husband and three children. Denies tobacco, EtOH,

Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient presented with mental
status changes and found to have severe DKA. She was started on
an insulin gtt and given approx 5 L fluid in the ED. The cause
for the exacerbation was unclear. The patient did report cough
with fever, but initial CXR was clear and the patient did not
have significant symptoms while in the hospital. Additionally,
the patient had abdominal pain, but there was no clear site of
infection on CT scan of the abdomen. Leukocytosis was felt to be
likely secondary to stress response. Patient also reported
headache and fever, but meningitis seemed much less likely. The
broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued as she had no
evidence of infection. She was transferred to the floor once her
DKA resolved. She was placed back on Levemir 40 units daily.
.
# Acute systolic heart failure on chronic heart failure: During
her ICU stay, she had Echocardiogram that showed EF of 40 %. She
reportedly had clean cath in [**2149**]. She received total of 10 L of
IV fluids because of persistent hypotension and tachycardia.
Repeat CXR was remarkable for new mild pulmonary edema. She
reported no increased SOB. She has chronic dyspnea on activity.
Her IV fluids were discontinued. She was placed on PO Lasix of
20 MG daily and Coreg 3.125 MG PO BID. Her O2 on activity
remained 98%. Her heart failure is probably related to
nonischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy, based on a clean cath. She
needs to establish an out patient cardiologist to titrate her
Coreg and R/O secondary causes of cardiomyopathy. She will
continue Lisinopril, Statin, and ASA. She remained tachycardiac
but this was believed to be related to heart failure. Her BP
recovered.
.
# Hypernatremia: improved. This should be followed by her PCP.
.
# Abnormal TSH: test should be repeated in [**12-23**] weeks, once she
recovers.
