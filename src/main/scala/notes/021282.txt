History of Present Illness:
Pt is [**Age over 90 **] yo female with lung CA (presumed), Afib, CHF, NIDDM,

vomiting fecal-like material. No F/C or dysuria. No bowel
movements or flatus for 3 days. Pt has chronic CP/SOB, but did
not have any CP/SOB in ED. NG was placed, 1 L of feculent emesis
was suctioned. CT showed small bowel obstruction. She received
levo/flagyl, protonix, [**Month/Year (2) **], morphine, and 5L NS. She was also
found to be guaiac positive in ED (guaiac neg by [**Doctor First Name **] consult).

.
In the ED she was found to be hypotensive to the 60's, and EKG
showed ST depressions in the lateral leads. Surgery was
consulted, and diagnosed likely bowel obstruction causing
ischemia, however the family decided on non-operative
management. Pt was admitted to the MICU for further management

.
CT abd/pelvis (prelim): Abnormally dilated loops of small bowel
with decompressed distal bowel consistent with small bowel
obstruction. Large cavitary lung mass in right lower lobe, large
mass in left lower lobe.
.
Abd XR: Numerous small air-fluid levels and several loops of
dilated bowel are concerning for obstruction. Lung masses at the
lung bases are better evaluated on previously performed chest
x-ray. Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine
including multiple lumbar spine vertebral body compression
fractures.
.
CXR: Interval increase in size in right lower lobe cavitary
lesion, and probable increase in right hilar adenopathy. Left
lower lobe nodule is unchanged. No evidence of focal
consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumoperitoneum.
.
Last EGD [**2134**]
Esophagus:
Mucosa: A salmon colored mucosa suggestive of short segment
Barrett's Esophagus was seen.
Stomach: Normal stomach
Duodenum: Flat Lesions A single small angioectasia that was not
bleeding was seen in the second part of the duodenum. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP
Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Impressions: Short segment Barrett's esophagus
Angioectasia in the second part of the duodenum (thermal
therapy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
Last Colonoscopy [**2132**]
Findings: Protruding Lesions Non-bleeding grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids
were noted.
Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal Colonoscopy to cecum

EKG: NSR @ 86, LAD, STD in I, II, III, aVL, V4-V6, TWI in I, II,
aVL (STD laterally are new)


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo f with presumed lung CA, CHF, DM, here with small bowel
obstruction.

Initial management in the MICU. Family declined surgery but
wanted to continue aggressive medical management of her
condition. The patient was maintained on IVF and her abdominal
exam improved. The NGT was removed and the patient was
transferred to the floor after starting po intake.  The morning
after transfer, she again became distended, developed pain and
began vomiting.  The NGT was replaced with 850 cc immediate
output. She was kept NPO/NGT/IVF for several days with no
improvement in her symptoms.  Extensive discussions were had
with the family regarding her unresolving SBO and the daughter
wanted to continue aggressive care. She became volume overloaded
while on IVF, so the fluid was d/c'ed as it was no longer
medically indicated. Output from her NGT stopped, so her NGT was
d/c'ed. She was kept comfortable and passed away.
