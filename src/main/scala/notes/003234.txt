Chest pain, shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 22833**] is a 67 year old female with a history of CAD s/p
LAD stents in [**2145**], type II diabetes, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who presents with one day of dyspnea on exertion
and subscapular pain.  Patient was in her usual state of health
until one day prior to admission. On the morning of presentation
she took her husband to the doctor for a routine visit.  On the
way into the building she had to walk up a ramp and noticed that
she was short of breath.  She stopped and caught her breath and
felt somewhat better.  The sensation returned when they got home
and she had to climb the 7 stairs into her house.  She got to
the top and had to reset.  At this time she also noticed pain
between her shoulder blades which reminded her of the pain she
felt 10 years ago when she had her myocardial infarction.  The
pain was not pleuritic.  It was associated with exertion and
dyspnea.  It was not associated with lightheadedness, dizziness,
diaphoresis and did not radiate.  It resolved with rest.  It
returned later in the evening and was more severe.  She recalls
feeling as if she were going to die.  She had her daughter call
EMS. In the ambulance she received aspirin 325 mg and SL
nitroglycerin x 1 which she says resolved her pain.

In the emergency room her initial vitals were T: 98.1 BP: 129/79
HR: 118 RR: 20 O2: 77% on RA which improved to 93% on 15L.  She
had a CXR which showed no acute process.  Her initial EKG showed
sinus tachycardia at 108 with left axis deviation, normal
intervals, no acute ST segment changes.  Her first troponin was
0.05 with CK of 186.  Cardiology was consulted who felt her
picture not consistent with acute coronary syndrome.  Her
d-dimer was elevated at 1143 and she underwent a CTA which
showed bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli.  She received
one liter normal saline and was started on IV heparin with a
bolus.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she is awake, alert and speaking in full
sentences.  She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain.
She continues to have dyspnea but this is improved with
supplemental oxygen.  She denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, dysuria, hematuria, diarrhea, constipation, melena,
hematochezia, leg pain or swelling.  She denies recent travel or
immobilziation.  No recent surgeries.  She is up to date on her
mammograms.  No PAP smear in last 10 years.  Due for
colonoscopy.

While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was continued on IV heparin and started on
coumadin.  She was initially requiring 6L nasal cannula and this
was weaned to 3L by hospital day two.  She had an echocardiogram
which showed mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with mild
free wall hypokinesis and mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. She had bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds
which were negative for DVT.  At no time was she hemodynamically
unstable. She is transferred to the floor for further
management.

EKG: sinus tachycardia at 108 with left axis deviation, normal

Imaging:
Chest XRAY [**2154-11-19**]: Single portable view of the chest in
upright position was obtained. The cardiac silhouette is
enlarged. There is no pneumothorax, consolidation, or large
pleural effusions. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The
osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes of the
thoracic spine.

CTA Chest [**2154-11-19**]: There are multiple bilateral filling defects
involving the lobar branches of the pulmonary artery consistent
with pulmonary embolism. The central airways are patent to the
segmental levels, bilaterally. There is motion artifact which
limits the study. There is no pneumothorax or consolidation. The
heart is normal in size and demonstrates right ventricular
strain. A coronary artery stent is seen in the LAD. There is no
mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
The visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate
vascular
calcifications. Atherosclerotic changes of the aorta without
evidence of
aneurysm.

Echocardiogram [**2154-11-20**]: The left atrium and right atrium are
normal in cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 22833**] is a 67 year old female with coronary artery
disease, hypertension, and diabetes who presents with
subscapular chest pain and shortness of breath found to have
bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with evidence of right
heart strain.
.
Pulmonary Embolism: Diagnosed by CT chest.  She was started on
IV heparin in the emergency room and coumadin on arrival to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Her echocardiogram showed evidence of mild right heart
strain but at no time was she hemodynamically unstable.  She was
initially requiring 6L of supplemental oxygen and upon transfer
to the floor she was requiring 3L.  It was weaned off by
discharge.  The etiology of her pulmonary emboli are unclear.
She had bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds whcih were
negative for DVT.  She is up to date on her mammograms.  She has
not had a recent PAP smear or colonoscopy.  She has one sister
with a history of a DVT but no other hi
