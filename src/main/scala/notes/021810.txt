ADDENDUM
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was extubated, remained
hemodynamically stable, but was tachycardic.  The patient was
titrated up on Captopril and Lopressor.  Captopril was raised
to 50 three times a day, Lopressor as high as 75 three times
a day.  Upon discharge, he was switched to Lisinopril 10 once
daily, and Lopressor 75 twice a day.  He was also continued
on aspirin and Plavix.  Pump-wise, his ejection fraction was
20%.  Therefore, he was continued on heparin.  Near the end
of the course of this hospital stay, he was started on
Coumadin.  Heparin was discontinued at the time of discharge,
and the patient will be followed at [**Hospital 197**] Clinic at the
rehabilitation facility.  Furthermore, the patient was
continued on a lasix regimen, 40 mg by mouth.  In terms of
rate and rhythm, there were no active issues, but the patient
will require EPS study as an outpatient.  This will be
scheduled through follow-up visit with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 43035**]
at the outpatient Cardiology Clinic.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was extubated, initially had
episodes of desaturation, which resolved after pulmonary
suctioning.  Eventually the patient was able to tolerate
nasal cannula and, at the time of discharge, he had oxygen
saturation of mid-90s on 4 liters nasal cannula.  The patient
has a good cough.  He is encouraged to proceed with
out-of-bed activities and rehabilitation at the
rehabilitation facility.

3.  Neurology:  The patient has had two subsequent CT scans
to evaluate for bleeds.  In both cases, no interval increase
in hemorrhage was noted.  After the second CT, one of the
hemorrhages was noted to have disappeared.  The patient was
cleared by Neurology to proceed on anticoagulation.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient initially spiked a
temperature up to 102.3, white blood count climbed to above
16. He was pancultured and started on Levaquin, vancomycin,
and later ceftazidime.  The Levaquin and vancomycin were
continued for a 14 day course, and the ceftazidime was
continued for a seven day course.  The patient, at the time
of discharge, had been afebrile for greater than 72 hours,
with white blood count having fallen.

5.  Renal:  BUN and creatinine have remained stable during
the course of the admission.  There are no active renal
issues.

6.  Trauma:  The patient initially was confined to bed rest,
was placed with neck collar.  After CT scan of the neck and
clinical evaluation by Trauma, the patient was cleared for
removal of the neck collar.  The patient also was complaining
of back pain.  Thoracic and lumbar spine films revealed no
signs of fracture or spinal cord compression.  The patient
was initially on total parenteral nutrition, but had no
abdominal pain and active bowel sounds, and was advanced to a
regular diet as tolerated.  First he tolerated liquid diet,
and then eventually was able to tolerate a cardiac diet.  The
patient has been experiencing a lot of shoulder and chest
pain, probably residual pain from surgery and motor vehicle
accident.  This pain has been treated with percocet and
Ambien for sleep.  He will likely have further pain in the
future.

On the day of discharge, the patient is hemodynamically
stable, alert and oriented x 3.  The patient still has
residual pain from the motor vehicle accident and subsequent
surgery.  The patient is being discharged to [**Hospital 38**]
[**Hospital **] Hospital.  He has been advised to schedule
follow-up appointment with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 43036**], within the next week or two.  The patient will
require PT and INR checks at [**Hospital 197**] Clinic, and also
optimization of blood pressure medications and electrolyte
checks to prevent hyperkalemia.

1.  Traumatic anterior myocardial infarction with stenting of
proximal left anterior descending status post motor vehicle
