Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial tachycardia
NASH cirrhosis with fulminant liver failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization [**2117-4-30**]

History of Present Illness:
44M w/ ESLD presented today for liver transplant, noted to have
HR in 100-160s w/ SBP 90-100s. Transplant was cancelled. Pt
denies lightheadedness, visual changes, palpitations, chest
pain. He has no hx of arhythmias.
.
EKG showed an irregular rhythm @ 150 bpm, an old RBBB, it was
difficult to identify p-waves. I delivered 7.5 mg metoprolol
over the course of roughly 20 minutes. The patient cardioverted
to a NSR @ 85 bpm.


Past Medical History:
--ESLD - NASH/cirrhosis/ESLD
--DM diet controlled
--HTN - SBP 120 off antihypertensives recently
--HYPERCHOL
--OBESITY
--DEPRESSION


Social History:
Currently lives alone. He cared for his father for the last 2
years of his life, and has not worked in 5 years. He is a
homosexual male who does not currently have a sexual partner. [**Name (NI) **]
used to work in a laboratory, but does not recall any needle
stick injuries. His last sexual partner was 4-5 years ago. He
has a number of local friends who provide support. He has never
used any intravenous drugs or snorted cocaine or heroin.

CHEST: crackles at bases
ABD: markedly distended, nt, bs+
EXT: 3+ pitting edema bl, warm, no c/c

Pertinent Results:
[**2117-4-29**] P-mibi: No diagnostic ischemic EKG changes or anginal
symptoms
noted. Mild, reversible inferior wall defect in the setting of
transient
ischemic dilatation. Mild global hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction 48%.
.
[**2117-4-30**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed
a right dominant system without angiographic evidence of
coronary artery disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx or RCA.  Of note,
the coronaries were relatively large and dye washed out quickly
- consistent with a high output state.
2. Hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left and right
heart
filling pressures. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension.
There was
significant respiratory variation in wedge and pulmonary artery
pressures. Cardiac output/index were elevated.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. The patient got FFP peri-procedure and only 20ml of dye in
total.
5. The venous and arterial sheaths were pulled in the holding
area
without immediate complication.
6. Of note, the patient's rhythm changed from an atrial
tachycardia at a
rate of 100-110 BPM to sinus rhythm at a rate of 60 bpm during
groin
access and during sheath pull.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries have no angiographic evidence of CAD.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.
Abdomen U/S [**2117-5-7**]: FINDINGS: The liver echotexture is
coarsened and the surface is nodular consistent with cirrhosis.
There is a small amount of ascites around the liver. There is no
large amount of ascites. There is a large amount of bowel gas,
which is causing the patient's abdominal distention. Doppler
evaluation demonstrates patent hepatic arteries with brisk
upstroke. There is hepatopetal flow in the extrahepatic portal
vein and hepatofugal flow in the very distal/intrahepatic portal
vein. Peak velocity is 20 cm/sec.
There is no biliary dilatation. There are no masses.
IMPRESSION:
1. Ascites surrounding the liver. There is now large amount of
ascites elsewhere. The abdominal distension is secondary
presumably to bowel gas, not fluid.
2. Patent portal vein, but irregular flow. This may be secondary
to reversal flow due to portal hypertension or change in flow
secondary to pulsation. These findings were related to the
clinical service on [**2117-5-7**].
