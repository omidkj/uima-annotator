Radiology
---------
[**2180-2-11**] 9:22 PM ~ ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with possible small-bowel
obstruction on outside film.
IMPRESSION: Multiple, relatively proportionately gas-distended
loops of large and small bowel extending to the rectum, without
free intraperitoneal air. Appearance is suggestive of adynamic
ileus, though early or incomplete SBO cannot be completely
excluded; correlate clinically, with imaging follow- up as
indicated.
.
[**2180-2-12**] 9:46 PM ~CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
HISTORY: Right IJ line. Assess placement, evaluate for
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Tube and line placement as described.
.
[**2180-2-12**] 4:50 AM ~ CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with history of colon CA status
post resection, presenting with abdominal distention and nausea.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple dilated loops of fluid-filled small bowel with
fecalized material in the distal ileum extending to the
ileocolonic anastomosis in the mid abdomen. Findings are
consistent with partial small- bowel obstruction. No evidence
for free intraperitoneal fluid or air. 2. Cystic mass in the
right adnexa and fluid filled endometrial cavity are both
concerning findings given the patient's age. Further
characterization with pelvic ultrasound is recommended on a
non-emergent basis if additional followup is warranted. 3. Small
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. 4.
Dilatation of the aortic root to 4.5 cm. Coronary artery
calcifications and enlargement of the pulmonary artery
suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 5. Left adrenal
adenoma. 6. Severe degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar
spine with numerous wedge compression deformities of unknown
chronicity.
.
[**2180-2-17**] 6:29 PM ~FOOT 2 VIEWS RIGHT
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:R foot pain and bruising
FINDINGS: No previous images. Frontal and lateral view show no
definite fracture. There is apparent dislocation of the third
PIP and subluxed fourth PIP. Question of a well-corticated bone
fragment at the distal fourth proximal phalanx. This could be a
sequela of previous injury, though an acute fracture cannot be
unequivocally excluded.
.
[**2180-2-17**] 2:57 PM ~ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: Rales and crackles
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-13**], there has been
the development of substantial pleural effusions bilaterally.
The pulmonary vessels are less sharply seen, consistent with
increasing pulmonary venous pressure. The endotracheal tube has
been removed and the right IJ catheter remains.
.
[**2180-2-18**] 2:21 PM ~FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT
INDICATION: Pain in the third and fourth right toes.
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance when compared to
[**2180-2-17**]. Dislocation of the third and fourth proximal
interphalangeal joint. Subluxation/dislocation of the second and
fifth metatarsophalangeal joint. A fracture at the base of the
fourth middle phalanx cannot reliably be excluded.
.
[**2180-2-20**] 11:28 AM ~CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: increased white count, please eval for acute pulmonary
proce
FINDINGS: Again noted are large bilateral pleural effusions and
right IJ line with tip in the SVC. The upper lungs are clear.
The lower lungs cannot be assessed due to the overlying
effusions.
.
[**2180-2-21**] 7:47 PM ~PORTABLE ABDOMEN
INDICATION: Recent small bowel obstruction status post LOA,
presenting with nausea and vomiting.
IMPRESSION: Limited examination. Recommend upright and supine
views to further assess bowel as indicated. No definite evidence
of obstruction. Dense material of the colon is probably from CT
evaluation nine days prior.
.
[**2180-2-22**] 9:00 PM ~CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
PROCEDURE: Chest portable for line placement on [**2180-2-22**].
IMPRESSION:
1. Right PICC line in a fairly satisfactory location at the
SVC/atrial junction. 2. New bilateral mild interstitial
pulmonary edema.
.
[**2180-2-22**] 11:52 AM ~CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
INDICATION: Status post exploratory laparotomy, [**2-12**], now
with elevated white blood cell count. Evaluate for abscess.
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated loops of small bowel and moderate amount of stool in
the colon. Findings are most suggestive of ileus. 2. Focal area
of peripheral circumferential gas within the colon, just
adjacent to the ileocolic anastomosis, most likely represents
gas trapped around luminal contents, as no other signs to
suggest bowel ischemia are present. 3. Increased bilateral
pleural effusions and atelectasis. 4. Small amount of fluid in
the pelvis without evidence of abscess. 5. Left adrenal gland
prominence could relate to adenoma as previously suggested,
although a focal nodule is not definitely visualized on today's
examination.
.
[**2180-2-24**] 10:00 AM ~CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: pulm edema, ? increasing effusions INDICATION: Followup.
IMPRESSION: No relevant changes as compared to [**2-22**].
