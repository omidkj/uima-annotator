.
26M with history of drug abuse who is an OSH transfer for
obtundation, drug abuse, and concern for suicide attempt.
.
According to mother (although per OSH, she had changed the story
several times), pt was assaulted at a store yesterday and was
choked with the [**Doctor Last Name **] of his sweatshirt by 2 people assaulting
him. He was also sprayed in the face with mace and wallet
stollen. Later in the day, he was apparently cleaning a roasting
pan and cut his wrist on a knife that was in the pan while
reaching into it. Mother noticed he was acting different and
slurring his speech, he seems like "he aws on something" so she
called EMS and sent pt to OSH ED where he appeared "obtunded."
His initial vitals were BP 94/27, HR 72, RR 14, 93%RA. He was
intubated for airway protection. While at OSH ED, he had head CT
and CXR, CT cervical spine which were unremarkable. He was given
narcan x2 with minimal improvement in arrousal. Trop 0.03, [**Doctor First Name **]
neg, ETOH neg. Lactate 0.8. He was transfered to our ED for
further care.
.

18 Assist control, 500 TV, 5 PEEP, 18 F, Ppeak 21. GLASCOW
initialy 15 in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Name8 (MD) **] RN report. FAST neg. Given bolues of
fent/versed. Given 3L IVF with 300cc total UO. He had CT
Cervical which was overall unremarkable. He had left wrist
laceration sp 6 sutures and tetanus vaccine. On exam, he was
found to have ligature mark on neck from likely recent
strangulation as well as what appeared to be cigerette burns
around his penis.
EKG and Tele notable for sinus bradycardia with HR 39-50s. He
was planned to be given 1g Ca Gluconate for possible BB/CCB
overdose but not given [**Name8 (MD) **] RN.
Urine positive for benzos, opiates, cocaine. (he was likely
given benzos and opiates for intubation, but cocaine is likely
recent intoxication). Recent vent settings: Assist control FiO2
50%, PEEP 5, Gas: 7.34/42/233/24.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt follows commands, responds to his
name, opens his eyes, GLASCOW=15. He appears comfortable,
