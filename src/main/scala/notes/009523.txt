Chief Complaint:
DVT, Coagulopathy, Acute Blood Loss Anemia, Bradycardia,
Dysphagia and Diarhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
EGD


History of Present Illness:
77 year old Female who was initially scheduled for a workup of
dysphagia and diarhea, and was brought by her family from home
with severe leg pain. On arrival in the ED, there was concern
for a DVT, which diagnosed with a LENI as bilateral common
femoral vein DVT's. She was recently started on coumadin due to
a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in [**11-13**].

Initially plans were to start LMWH, as her access has been
extremely problem[**Name (NI) 115**] in the past including inability to draw
labs. Eventually labs were drawn, when it was noted that her INR
was 8.1 and her hematocrit had dropped to 22. She was also noted
to be bradycardic.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute DVT, Coagulopathy: INR on admission was 8.1. Unclear
what her INR had been over the past several days, but she
certainly was not subtherapeutic as the pharmacokinetics would
be inconsistent with this. Her differential diagnosis for her
hypercoagulability includes chiefly widespread malignant
processes. Hereditary causes are also possible given h/o DVT in
[**2157**], however, less likely given the lateness of these
presentations. Also, it seems patient is not very active at home
and with this recent acute illness may have been more bedbound
than usual.
During hospitalization, received 2 units FFP for partial
reversal and INR slowly drifted down until not therapeutic.
Received 1 unit PRBCs and hematocrit stable during
hospitalization. When INR was 1.7, patient had colonoscopy for
malignancy workup and for chronic diarrhea (as below). After
this, she was bridged with heparin x 24 hours, then switched to
lovenox bridge. She will need 24 hour lovenox bridge (until AM
of [**2188-1-1**] as long as INR remains therapeutic at 2-3) with every
other day INR checks starting tomorrow ([**2188-1-1**]). Heme-onc was
consulted while inhouse, heme workup was started (results as
above) and patient will f/u in thrombosis clinic as outpatient.
In addition, she had colonoscopy for malignancy workup, biopsies
pending. SPEP with elevated IgG, unclear implications, will f/u
as outpatient. Restarted on ASA 81mg given cardiac history.

2. Delerium - Given coagulopathy and fairly severe delerium at
time of examination, was concerned about intracranial bleed on
admission, but CT head normal. Mental status improved to
baseline over course of hospitalization.

3. Acute Blood Loss Anemia - Unclear etiology, however with INR
of 8, bleeding occultly is the primary concern. Colonoscopy
unimpressive, will f/u with GI as outpatient. Received 1 unit
PRBCs during hospitalization and Hct stable, hemodynamically
stable. Discharged on iron supplementation as well.

4. Bradycardia, Atrial Fibrillation - Spoke with outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Asymptomatic of her bradycardia,
remained euvolemic without worsened heart failure during
hospitalization. EP not consulted because she was asymptomatic
and unclear if pacer placement in line with goals of care of
patient/family, and no acute need to do so given her
coagulopathy as above
