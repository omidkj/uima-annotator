HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 24-year-old [**Country **]
Rican gentleman with a history of CML status post matched
unrelated allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant,
whose hospital course has been complicated with severe
graft-versus-host disease of skin, GI tract, and liver, who
presents today with acute onset of abdominal pain.  Patient
has been on home TPN as well as a variety of regimens for his
graft-versus-host disease including photophoresis and most
recently treated with CellCept [**Pager number **] mg [**Hospital1 **] and cyclosporin.
The patient has had slowly improving liver function tests in
this setting.  He comes in today complaining of intermittent
constipation for 10 days, and also with a relatively acute
onset of localized abdominal pain in the periumbilical area.
He has been afebrile with no other complaints.

Specifically, he denies any fevers, chills, night sweats,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in his stool, melena.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic myelogenous leukemia diagnosed in [**2113-6-30**], positive [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome, status post MUD BMT
[**2114-8-30**] complicated by severe engraftment syndrome
requiring intubation.
2. Severe graft-versus-host disease of abdominal tract, skin,
and liver.
3. History of Clostridium difficile colitis.
4. Cardiomyopathy secondary to cytoxan, ejection fraction of
40%, now resolved.
5. Status post hernia repair.
6. Undescended testicles.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Patient is afebrile.
General:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Country **] Rican male, who speaks some English,
cachectic.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Oropharynx:  Red with
sore on upper lip, no evidence of thrush.  Neck is supple.
Pulmonary:  Scattered crackles at right base.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Abdomen is soft with localized tenderness in the
periumbilical area, no clear guarding, questionable minimal
rebound, right upper quadrant epigastric or left upper
quadrant tenderness.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count of 12.2, hemoglobin of
8.4, hematocrit 23.8, platelets 143.  BUN 43, creatinine 1.2,
ALT 272, AST 93, alkaline phosphatase 750.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. GI:  The patient received abdominal CT scan on admission
which showed free air within the abdomen and a moderate
amount of free fluid.  There was also evidence of mild
thickening of the wall of multiple distal small bowel loops,
but difficult to evaluate given no oral contrast.  Given this
CT scan finding, the patient was taken to surgery.

On [**7-14**], he received an exploratory laparotomy with
drainage of intraabdominal abscess as well as an oversew of
perforated pyloric channel ulcer with omental ...........
patch.  After surgery, the patient was started on aggressive
bowel regimen for constipation and experienced gradual
resolution in his pain.  The patient was placed on TPN
throughout his hospitalization, but demonstrated an
increasing appetite.  Prior to discharge, the patient had one
week of formed bowel movements.

A CT scan performed on [**7-25**] prior to discharge was
significant for improvement in the free air and free fluid.

2. Hematology/Oncology:  Patient admitted with a history of
CML with severe graft-versus-host disease of the skin, gut,
and liver.  The patient was maintained on the Solu-Medrol,
cyclosporin, and CellCept for graft-versus-host disease, with
cyclosporin levels checked regularly and doses adjusted
accordingly.  Patient was also instructed to continue use of
his tacrolimus, which he used topically for his
graft-versus-host disease complications of his lips.

The patient's generally decreasing LFTs as well as his
ability to form stool indicated that his graft-versus-host
disease was being sufficiently treated.

3. Infectious Disease:  A peritoneal swab specimen obtained
during surgery grew out Pseudomonas and fungus, and the
patient was started on fluconazole, Vancomycin, and Flagyl
shortly after surgery.  Infectious Disease consult team saw
patient and recommended fluconazole and Zosyn for seven days.

The patient completed the full seven day course of
fluconazole and Zosyn, and when transferred back to the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**], these medications were not continued.  The evening of
his transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] and the following morning,
the patient developed low-grade fevers.  His blood cultures
were sent.  Urine cultures were sent, and his right IJ tip
were sent for cultures.  The patient was placed back on Zosyn
per ID approval, and once a chest x-ray became positive for a
new left basilar infiltrate consistent with pneumonia,
levofloxacin was added to his antibiotic regimen.

A CT scan performed on [**7-22**] was significant for
multifocal patchy pulmonary opacities in the peribronchial
distribution involving mid and lower lung zones with
associated bronchial obstruction of segments of the left
lower lobe consistent with aspiration pneumonia versus fungal
infection.

Given these findings, expectorated sputum and induced sputum
samples were sent for culture.  The cultures from the sputum
samples eventually grew out Aspergillus fumigatus.  A CT scan
performed on [**7-25**] was significant for interval
resolution of a mucoid impaction of the left lower lobe
airways, however, tree ............... opacities and
ill-defined peribronchial nodules and foci of consolidations
were discovered primarily in the lower lobes, but also in the
right middle lobe and lingula.  These findings were
considered consistent with worsening infection with a
possibility of aspergillus infection.  Given these sputum
culture results as well as these radiological findings, the
patient was started on voreconazole per recommendation of the
Infectious Disease team.

Once the patient was afebrile for several days, and
demonstrated remarkable clinical improvement, Zosyn was
discontinued on [**7-27**].  On the hospital day before
discharge, the patient's LFTs were noted to increase
significantly.  Infectious Diseases was consulted and
recommended changing voreconazole to caspofungin secondary to
voreconazole's effect on the liver.

As a bacterial etiology to the patient's pulmonary disease,
was considered treated, levofloxacin was discontinued prior
to discharge.

3. Cardiovascular:  After transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], the
patient's blood pressure became gradually increased with
diastolic blood pressure over 100.  Lopressor was started and
eventually increased to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].  The patient's
cyclosporin levels were found to be markedly elevated given
thought to be secondary to voreconazole increasing their
levels.  Once this interaction was identified, and the
patient's cyclosporin levels were decreased in half, his
blood pressures were more easily manageable.  The patient
will be discharged with nifedipine 5 mg po prn for diastolic
blood pressures over 95.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE/STATUS:  Good.

1. Chronic myelogenous leukemia status post MUD transplant

gut, and liver.
