History of Present Illness:
83 F called EMS because she felt "not good for too long." Pt
denies weakness. She states that she last felt well until about
4 weeks ago when she returned from a visit to her daughter in
[**Name (NI) 5256**].  She states that she just felt tired after

 Dark brown and voluminous. 1-2 weeks ago she developed a cough,
occasionally productive of yellow sputum.  She has also had some

states she has had a normal appetite. Denies rash. No recent
antibiotic use. No abd or back pain.

         When the EMS arrived, they found her VS BP 152/82 HR
102, irregular, RR 20 93% RA w/ LLL PNA. Placed patient on O2
and transported to ED.
In the ED, she had a CXR which suggested LLL pna and was started
on Levofloxacin. She then developed respiratory distress and was
intubated. A CT chest was negative for PE but notable for ....

          ROS also notable for progressive Lower extremity
edema. + erythema of lower extremity. Pt feels her legs are a
"weak part of her body."

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia: LLL consolidation apparent on both AP and lateral
views on admission. She also had a chest CT which showed no PE,
but did show apparent PNA in right lung as well.  Likely CAP,
but multilobar.  She was treated with Levaquin initially, then
switched to ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  She defervesed on
this regimen and her O2 requirement improved.  WBC ct also
returned to nL.  Continued this for a 10 day course.
.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Pt not on coumadin for this.  She was
apparently on this in past and has chosen not to take.
Continuing ASA 325 PO daily.  Continue diltiazem 90 mg qid for
rate control as this is working well. BPs stable on this drug.
She was apparently on coumadin in the distant past but has been
refusing this recently per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 12883**].  She was not sent out on
this, but was told to readdress this with her PCP this week.
The risks of not being on this were explained to pt.  She
understands.
.
3.CHF: As her course continued and per ED notes, she was given
3L NS over the course of the day.  She was persistently
tachycardic and thus was given Lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 and 12.5 mg
PO. At 8 pm, she became increasingly more tachypneic, her sats
decreased to 90% NRB, she was given 60 mg IV lasix, ceftriaxone
1 gm IV, and was placed on NTG gtt. She was subsequently
intubated. Given the ED's concern for PE, pt then had CTA which
showed no PE, but showed patchy ground glass opacities,
bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations c/w CHF and
multifocal PNA.
Pt with slightly low EF, but believe main issue here is DD given
fluid overload, RVR to a fib recently. She received large amt of
IVFs in ED due to low BP and then additional blood/fluids in
ICU.  She was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was diuresed and abx
continued.  Successfully extubated. Her HR was controlled with
dilt gtt for some time and she has now been switched to PO dilt
with moderate rate control.  Had an echo here which confirmed
decent EF of 45%, 1+ MR, 1+TR, mild PA sys HTN.  She also had
episode of low UOP, received more IVFs and again had trouble
with pleural effusions/pulm edema.  Did not require
reintubation, but was considered.  She has since been diuresed
fairly aggressively.  On day of transfer, she had a
thoracentesis on left side with 630 cc removed.  Once reaching
floor, she had continued daily diuresis with 80 IV Lasix and had
improvement in both exam and oxygen requirements.  On transfer,
she was doing well on 2LNC and was sent out on 80 mg IV Lasix.
Her kidneys had been tolerating this well, and our goal of -500
to 1 liter per day was attained with this. At rehab, her I/Os
and daily wts will need to be monitored and Lasix adjusted prn.
Also her K will need to be watched closely as she has been
losing this with loop diuresis.
.
4. Black stool: Apparently c/o black stools at home that have
resolved.  They have been brown and guaiac neg here in hospital.
 She should be scheduled for an outpt colonoscopy by her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was stable throughout.
.
5. Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid, TSH was normal
.
6.Pt was evaluated by S&S given fact that her PNA was multilobar
and she has had mult PNAs in past.  Aspiration was a concern. As
a result, they rec video swallow as an outpt, but felt she was
okay for thin lqs, ground solids until then. This was scheduled
and pt/rehab will be contact[**Name (NI) **] for date/time.
