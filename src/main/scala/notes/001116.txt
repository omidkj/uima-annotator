Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31014**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
79-year-old male with ischemic CHF NYHA IV (EF 30%) BiV ICD,
pAFIB on coumadin, CKD (Cr 1.6-1.8), hx of LGIB (angioectasia
colonoscopy [**2179**]) with down trending Hct from the low 30s-> 27.5
with progressive fatigue, DOE with any activity.
.
Patient complained of dyspnea with minimal exertion that was
worsening over the last few weeks. He could only walk ~10 feet
before feeling short of breath. He stated that his lasix has
been increased over the last 2 weeks and he was on 160mg [**Hospital1 **],
without symptomatic relief or resolution of significant lower
extremity edema. He was also on spirolactone and metolazone. His
stated that his weight has been stable at ~205lbs. He also
complained of orthopnea.
.
He denied having any chest pain or other respiratory symptoms.
He had darker stools since he was started on iron pills, but
denied having any blood on stool or black tarry stools.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4 67 107/56 18 99% RA. He
overall appeared comfortable. His EKG showed a ventricular-paced
rythm, bigeminy with rate in the 70s. His labs were notable for
creatine at 1.8 (trending up for the last 2-3 months, but at his
baseline), proBNP: 765, Hct at 27.3. Guaiac +.  His chest X-ray
showed pulmonary congestion. The patient was then admitted for
further evaluation.
.
On the arrival to the floor, pt appears slightly uncomfortable.
He states to have increased dyspnea on exertion.

.
ECG ([**2180-5-10**]  12:27:36 PM)
Demand ventricular paced rhythm with frequent ventricular
premature beats.
Q-T interval prolongation. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
ECG ([**2180-5-15**]  2:30:34 PM)
Ventricular pacing with wide complex native beats, probably
ventricular in
origin. Since the previous tracing of [**2180-5-10**] the ventricular
bigeminal pattern is not seen but ventricular premature beats
persist.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2180-5-10**] 1:33 PM)
IMPRESSION:
1. Ill-defined bibasilar opacities, possible aspiration or
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Underlying mild
interstitial lung disease is also possible.
2. Intact pacemaker/ICD leads in standard position.
3. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
4. Possible small effusions or pleural thickening.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2180-5-14**] 9:26 AM)
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable background COPD.
2. Cardiomegaly, with sternotomy and ICD device.
3. Bibasilar opacities, ? infectious, inflammatory or
aspiration. Suspect
some background more diffuse interstitial abnormality. If there
is clinical concern for an infectious process, followup imaging
to confirm resolution is recommended. Chest CT may be useful to
evaluate the background parenchymal pattern.
4. Bilateral pleural thickening.
5. ?increased soft tissue density adjacent to right paratracheal
region, not fully assessed here. Attention to that area at the
time of CT scan is
recommended.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2180-5-14**] 4:32 PM)
IMPRESSION: Fibrotic lung changes with a pattern corresponding
to NSIP, of
overall mild-to-moderate severity. Further pulmonologic workup
is strongly
suggested. Mild-to-moderate mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with
partly calcified lymph nodes, that might suggest previous
exposure to granulomatous disease and also might be related to
the fibrotic lung changes. Status post CABG, left pectoral
pacemaker in correct position.
No evidence of pulmonary nodules or masses. Minimal bilateral
pleural effusions. No pericardial effusions, no osteodestructive
lesions.
.
Cardiac Cath ([**2180-5-15**])
1. Markedly elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

Video swallow study ([**2180-6-8**])
1. Aspiration of thin liquids with moderate residue
2. Barium reflux to nasopharynx
3. large osteophyte in C3

Brief Hospital Course:
79-year-old male with ischemic CHF NYHA IV (EF 30%) BiV ICD,
pAFIB on coumadin, CKD (Cr 1.6-1.8), hx of LGIB (angioectasia
colonoscopy [**2179**]) with down trending Hct from the low 30s-> 27.5
with progressive fatigue, DOE with any activity who was admitted
for CHF exacerbation.

# CORONARIES:  Pt has hx of 3 vessel disease with CABG in [**2172**],
he denied having any chest pain on admission. ASA, BB, statin
were continued on admission. He was started on losartan but due
to his acute kidney injury in setting of diuresis, his [**Last Name (un) **] was
discontinued.  It will need to be restarted as outpatient.

# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF:  Pt with hx of CHF last echo
showed EF of 30%, fluid overloaded on exam. He appears to not be
responding appropriate to home dose of lasix, spironolactone and
metolazone. He was treated with IV lasix/metolazone and assessed
for further diuresis on a daily basis. However, his BP was often
too low and his daily lasix was held on numerous occasions. On
[**2180-5-14**] he was transfused w 2 Units of blood over 4 hours each
(for dropping Hct)
