LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission notable for white count
of 9.6 with 74 percent neutrophils, 15 percent lymphs, no
bands, hematocrit of 46.1, platelets 208,000, PTT 28.5, and
INR 1.9.  Chemistries:  Sodium 139, potassium 5.1, chloride
101, bicarbonate 28, BUN 26, creatinine 1.4 at baseline, and
glucose 132.  Initial set of cardiac enzymes showed CK of 96,
troponin T of 0.02.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate
of 100 to 150 with left axis deviation and questionable new T-
waves in leads III and aVF.  Chest x-ray showed flattened
diaphragm, no CHF, no infiltrate.  ABG showed pH of 7.28,
PCO2 of 57, and PAO2 of 87.

This is a 74-year-old male with COPD exacerbation complicated
by respiratory distress.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for COPD exacerbation with mask
ventilation, nebulizers, IV steroids, and levofloxacin for
presumed upper respiratory infection/bronchitis.  The
patient's respiratory status improved.  The patient was
weaned from the mask, started on a steroid taper, and was
transferred out to the floor on [**2185-4-23**].  The patient's
oxygen was weaned, steroids tapered, antibiotics continued.
The patient ambulated with stable O2 saturations.  The
patient was ultimately cleared by PT for safe discharge to
home and discharged home with VNA.  At the time of discharge,
O2 saturation on room air was approximately 95 percent.  The
patient was breathing comfortably with no active issues.

Alcohol abuse.  The patient has had a history of alcohol
withdrawal.  The patient was started on a CIWA scale with
Ativan.  B12 and folate were checked, found to be within
normal limits.  The patient was explained the risks of
drinking while having a COPD exacerbation.  The patient was
started on thiamine and continued on thiamine.  Social work
consult was obtained for substance abuse.  The patient's
mental status remained stable throughout hospitalization.

Atrial fibrillation:  Improved with decrease in respiratory
distress.  Mild elevation of troponin likely due to demand
ischemia.  The patient was continued on Coumadin.  CK and
troponin were cycled and remained flat.  No further EKG
changes were evident.  The patient denied any chest pain and
was started on home medications.

FEN.  The patient was given a cardiac diet with Pedialyte as
needed.  Prophylaxis was with Coumadin.  PPI, bowel regimen,
regular insulin sliding scale while on steroids.  The
patient's code status remained full code during this
hospitalization.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  Discharged to home with
services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.

Alcohol abuse.

Atrial fibrillation.

Upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Depression.

Hypertension.

4. Verapamil 40 mg p.o. q.[**1-11**].
5. Prednisone taper 40 mg x2 days, and 20 mg x2 days, and 15
