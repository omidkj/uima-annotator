Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
88 y/o F h/o breast CA, AFib (on amiodarone), MDD, recently
admitted in [**9-8**] for FTT now presents with weakness, poor
appetite and abdominal discomfort. At rehab, labs were notable
for elevated LFTS and BUN 60, thus aldactone, lasix and
amiodarone held and she was sent here for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals 97.2 96/71, HR 66 RR 16 97%RA but then
HR 170s, SBP 70, afebrile. SHe was given 2L IVF, refused CVL.
Levo/Vanc given for concern for infection (elevated WBC,
afebrile, CXR with ? infiltrate). Pts HR had minimal response to
the IVF and remained hypotensive. DCCV was considered in ED but
pt declined because of the risk of stroke. Heparin gtt was
started but then stopped. In addition, given SBP pt was started
on neosynephrine and transferred to CCU.
Pt currently denies abdominal pain, CP, palpitations, N/V or
diarrhea, just reports poor PO intake, decreased appetite. SHe
does report some SOB that is worse lying flat.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:[**10-3**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. Mild
to moderate ([**2-2**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo female with h/o a.fibb who presents with poor PO intake
and A fib with RVR and hypotension.
.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - Patient has long history of a fibb,
however her rapid rate on -presentation was thought to be due to
infection and dehydration.  She has not been on coumadin since
[**8-2**] GIB and fall risk.  She also requested not to have
cardioversion at this time, as she is unwilling to tolerate the
stroke risk.  Her heart rates were controlled by starting
amiodarone and dig loads.  Beta-blockaid was also uptitrated.
She was breifly given neosynephrine for BP support.  Given her
fall risk and history of GI bleed, she is not on heparin or
coumadin.  She was anticoagulated with aspirin 325mg daily.  TSH
was nl at 3.2.
.
HYPOTENSION - Patient presented with SBPs in the 70s.  This low
pressure was thought to be related to mild infection in the
setting of hypovolemia.  She was briefly started on
neosynepherin and given IVF.
.
PNEUMONIA - She preseted with a lactate 3.3, mildly elevated
WBC, and elevated LFTs.  Her CXR showed a possible infiltrate
and U/A was negative.  She was initially started on Vanc and
Levofloxacin, which was narrowed to levofloxacin.  She should
complete a seven day course for community-acquired PNA.
.
ABDOMINAL PAIN - She initially had some abdominal pain that
resolved without intervention.  She had an elevated ALT, AST,
Alk phos and T.bili, and RUQ U/S showed gallstones but no
