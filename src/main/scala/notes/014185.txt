Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
aortic stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
redo sternotomy/ AVR(#21 StJude [**First Name3 (LF) 9041**] Porcine)[**8-13**]


History of Present Illness:
74 yo F with pmh of CAD s/p CABG [**2177**] (lima to LAD and SVG to
circ) and s/p PCI (BMS of RCA in [**6-1**]), severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7
/echo; 0.5/cath), CHF, HTN, asthma presents from an OSH
(admitted there on [**2182-7-25**]) for surgical/ cardiology evaluation
of her AS. She has had progressive DOE x 1 year. This had
worsened over the past 1 week (DOE with 5 steps), accompanied by
cough. She was initially treated with levaquin by her PCP for
presumed PNA with little relief. She also has c/o orthopnea.
When she did not improve she was sent to the ED by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
the OSH she was treated for pneumonia (total 14 days levaquin),
CHF (BNP in 6000's), and eval. by CT [**Doctor First Name **] for AVR. She also had
elevated LFTs thought [**12-28**] to hepatic congestion. Per records she
was HIT positive with a plt drop of 273 to 151 (?borderline via
criteria). She was started on lepirudin, which was briefly held
for gum bleeding after surgery (teeth extraction x 3).
Additionally, she was found to have a EF of 15% by ECHO
(previously 60% in [**6-1**]). CT [**Doctor First Name **] felt she was too high risk
for surgery. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] per family wish
for further eval/2nd opinion. Of note, plavix was stopped at
OSH.  On transfer the pt. was tachypneic (rr>30's), using
accessory muscles for breathing, tachy to 110, but maintaining
her BP. Due to her respiratory distress the patient was
transferred to the CCU.

Past Medical History:
Chronic systolic heart failure
MI s/p CABG ('[**77**] LIMA to LAD; SVG to LCx), RCA stent in [**2181**]
(BMS), Asthma, HTN, aortic stenosis (0.7cm on echo, 0.5cm on
c.cath), diverticulitis s/p abscess w/ surgical correction,
herpes zoster, psoriasis, PE in [**2177**], h/o DVT, IVC filter in
[**2176**], APPY, ventral hernia repair, shoulder ORIF, recent tooth
extraction for periodontal disease.

CV: SEM at RUSB.
Chest: expiratory wheezes, rales 1/3 up lungs bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
OSH Echo [**2182-6-11**] shows preserved LV fxn w/ EF 20%, normal LV
dimensions. mild concentric LVH, severe AS w/ [**Location (un) **] and peak
gradients of 56 and 91mmHg  with calculated calce area of
0.7cm2.
.
TTE [**2182-8-12**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is [**4-4**]  mmHg. A small secundum type atrial septal
defect is seen with left-to-right flow. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity  size. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the septum, anterior wall and apex. The inferior and
inferolateral walls contract best.[Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2182-8-12**]:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
native 3
vessel CAD.  The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow
limiting
disease.  The proximal LAD had a 70% stenosis with competitive
LIMA
flow.  The LCx had a severely diseased OM branch with
competitive SVG
flow.  The RCA had a patent proximal proximal stent.
2.  Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA-->LAD graft
to be
widely patent.  The SVG to OM was widely patent.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
systolic and
diastolic blood pressures.
4.  Severe aortic stenosis as described by echocardiogram.  No
attempt
was made to cross the aortic valve due to patient's clinical
condition.
5.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Widely patent LIMA and SVG grafts.
3. Cardiomyopathy with severe aortic stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to CCU for respiratory distress and diuresis in the
setting of severe AS.
Patient was diuresed while awaiting valve replacement. Patient's
respiratory distress improved with diuresis.  It was felt to be
secondary to chronic pulmonary edema and aortic stenosis.
According to medical records, platelets decreased from 273 to
140's, pt HIT Ab positive. Started on lepirudin at OSH per
Heme/onc consult, which was briefly held [**12-28**] to gum bleeding
post-dental surgery then restarted.  Upon admission, patient was
started on argatroban, which was continued until her serotonin
release assay came back negative and it was decided she did not
have HIT.
Treated at OSH for presumed PNA with 14 days of levaquin.  She
did develop asymptomatic bacturia with coagulase negative staph.
 Given that she was awaiting surgery, there was a low threshold
for treatment.  She received vanc until sensitivities came back,
at which time she was switched to doxycycline.
Plavix was held in anticipation of surgery as she had received a
bare metal stent more than six weeks prior to presentation.
Incidental finding of right kidney on CTA of chest and abdomen:
"There is 9.4 x 6.9 mm exophytic enhancing lesion arising from
the interpolar cortex of the right kidney.  This lesion is
worrisome and may be further assessed with an MRI."  Patient
requires follow-up as an outpatient.
She was taken to the operating room on [**8-13**] where she underwent
a redo-sternotomy, AVR (#21 St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9041**] Porcine). She was
transferred to the ICU in critical but stable condition on
vasopressin, levophed and epinephrine. She was extubated later
that same day. She was weaned from her vasoactive srips by POD
#2. She initally had poor oxygenation but improved with
aggresive diuresis. She was transferred to the floor on POD #6.
She complained of difficulty swallowing and swallow evaluation
but refused speech and swallow evaluation and she had no further
problems with eating or drinking. She required a 1:1 sitter for
confusion but improved when her narcotics were discontinued and
she was given small doses of haldol. She was ready for discharge
to rehab on [**2182-8-23**]
