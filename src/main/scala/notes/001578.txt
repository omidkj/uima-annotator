[**8-22**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Pancreatitis, with non-enhancement of the pancreatic neck.
This finding is concerning for necrosis of the pancreatic neck.
The pancreatic body and tail enhance with contrast, however.
Less than one-third of the gland is affected.
2. Distention of the stomach and prominence of the duodenum
bowel wall,
especially in the second portion near the pancreatic head. There
is
surrounding mesenteric stranding, which may be related to the
pancreatitis. However, duodenitis is another diagnostic
consideration.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
4. Rounded lesion within the L4 vertebral body, of relative
lucency. This
probably represents a hemangioma, but if there is any clinical
concern,
further evaluation with bone scan could be performed.
5. Air in the bladder, likely related to instrumentation. Please
correlate with urinalysis.

[**8-22**] CXR: Right lower lobe atelectasis with elevated right
hemidiaphragm.

[**8-24**] CXR: Comparison is made to [**2119-8-23**]. The left
subclavian central venous line tip is not definitely visualized
due to technique. Lung volumes are further reduced. There is
unchanged pulmonary edema, allowing for the differences in
volume. There is worsening right lower lobe atelectasis. Patchy
left lower lobe opacity could be additional atelectasis or
possible aspiration.
.
[**2119-8-28**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size and
systolic function. No structural heart disease or pathologic
flow identified. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
# DKA: The pt has a history of DM2 with poor medicine compliance
related to difficulty with proper education, and financial
troubles with buying insulin. He presented to the ED at
[**Hospital **] hospital with a blood sugar of 976, and anion gap of
30. His blood gas was 7.31/26/121 at that time. His urine had
glucose of 1000 and 50 ketones. He was started on an insulin
drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for an ICU bed. On arrival at
[**Hospital1 18**] his blood sugar was 437 and his anion gap was 15. He was
admitted to the ICU on and insulin drip, and his blood sugars
normalized, and the anion gap closed. He was taken off the
insulin gtt, and transferred to the floor on the second hospital
day. [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center was consulted, and provided
recommendations for an insulin regimen for him while in the
hospital, and initiated teaching for home insulin use. Once he
began eating, his metformin 1000 [**Hospital1 **] was restarted.
.
# Pancreatitis: Mr. [**Known lastname **]' pancreatitis is thought to be
idiopathic, with a lipase of 1330 on admission. Gallstones were
an unlikely cause as he had normal LFTS, CT and U/S. He has no
significant ETOH history and triglycerides within normal limits.
CT showed <[**1-16**] of the pancreas involved with a question of
possible neck region necrosis, and a prominent duodenum wall. It
was felt that there were no indications for antibiotic
treatment. His WBC count and amylase & lipase steadily returned
to normal and his hematocrit was stable. He was given percocet
for pain control. After he came to the floor from the MICU,
where he had been NPO, we advanced his diet as tolerated, and he
was tolerating a full po diabetic diet on discharge with no
problems.
.
# anemia:Mr. [**Known lastname **] was likely hemoconcentrated when admitted,
and his hematocrit was stable throughout his hospitalization.
.
# trouble swallowing: Mr. [**Known lastname **] reported occasional difficulty
with swallowing, and has a known history of an esophageal ring.
.
# hypoxemia: A CXR showed RLL atelectasis w/ pleural effusion.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was diuresed (his fluid status had been very positive
since admission due to his pancreatitis), and encouraged to use
an incentive spirometer. His respiratory function steadily
improved, and he was stable on room air for several days prior
to discharge.
