Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman with
oligodendroglioma that later progressed to anaplastic
oligodendroglioma who presents after a seizure at home.  He was
at home with his wife 1 day prior to admission and started
"feeling seizurish".  She gave him a dose of sublingual
lorazepam.  He then had a short (~8 sec) seizure.  His wife
called his neuro-oncologist, Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office who advised her
to take him to the ED.  While in route by ambulance, patient had
another seizure lasting a total of 8 minutes.  He was intubated
for airway protection but endotracheal tube was placed in the
esophagus. Upon arrival to OSH ED, patient was re-intubated
endotracheally and given phenytoin, dexamethasone, Versed,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation and care.  Given his history of bilateral
pulmonary embolism after surgical procedure in [**11-11**], at [**Hospital1 18**]
CTA performed demonstrating small subsegmental pulmonary
embolism, lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT, and a
head CT showed a small bleed in the area of surgical resection
cavity.  Neuro-Oncology was consulted as to whether
anticoagulation was reasonable in setting of head bleed.  It was
decided that benefit of SC heparin outweighed the risks.
Patient was managed in the NeuroICU.  He was quickly extubated.
He has been in a post-ictal state that has been steadily
clearing.  Per Neurology housestaff, has baseline persistent
left-sided weaksness was worse in the upper extremity.  He was
transferred to Onology Medicine Service (under Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**]) on
[**2178-12-16**] for chemotherapy and further managemet.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2178-12-15**] 7:22 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: assess for bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old man with h/o brain tumor w/ seizures, ? new rt ICH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 58-year-old man with history of brain tumor
(oligodendroglioma s/p resection) and seizures. Evaluate for new
intracranial hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: Noncontrast head CT dated [**2178-11-20**] and the
MRI of [**11-13**]. [**2178**].

TECHNIQUE: Routine noncontrast head CT.

FINDINGS: An approximate 12-mm rounded area of increased density
is seen within the right temporal lobe, below the area of tumor
resection, where there is a known mass. This likely represents a
focus of hemorrhage.

There is stable hypodensity within the white matter within the
temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Stable bilateral
ventricular prominence is seen. No new areas of mass effect are
identified. There are no findings to indicate acute territorial
infarction.

Surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures again reveal the
right parietal craniotomy site.
The sinuses are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:
Small focus of hemorrhage within the left temproal lobe tumor.
No substantial change in the morphology of the brain or extent
of edema.
