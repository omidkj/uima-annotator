Chief Complaint:
vomiting, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) 4338**] L spine


History of Present Illness:
76 year-old woman discharged [**2175-1-18**] after prolonged history of
L4-L5 osteomyletis/discitis (week 10 of 12 of vanc), psoas
myositis, viridans strep bacteremia, and multiple other medical
issues who presents from her nursing home with diarrhea and
vomiting x 3 days.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had episodes of hypotension (SBP down to 60's),
and was given 7 L NS. She was found to have positive UA,
elevated Cr of 2.8 (up to 3.3 at NH, baseline 0.9), and WBC
count of 16.3. She was placed on levophed through a PICC line
(pt refused central line). An arterial line was attempted but
was unsuccessful in the ED. SBP improved to 110 after IVF and
pressors. She received dexamethasone 10mg IV, and had a 250mcg
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. CT scan showed possible L4-L5 osteomyelitis and
aspiration pneumonia. Neurosurg was consulted, who did not
recommend surgical intervention for osteo. In the ED, she
received ceftaz, flagyl, vanco, as well as oxycodone and IV
dilaudid.
.
Pt reports last fever was "1 month ago." She was afebrile in the
ED. She currently denies CP, SOB, N/V, diarrhea. She only c/o
chronic back and knee pain.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-3-14**] 2:21 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic collection over inferior aspect of axillobifemoral
graft just prior to crossover of femorals measuring 5.8 x 4.6 x
10.1 cm.
2. Significant endplate changes with erosive changes noted at
L4-L5 which may represent an osteomyelitis.
3. Increased interstitial markings with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern
which may represent infection and possible aspiration pneumonia.
4. Coil within uterus: removal should be considered.
.
Portable AP [**3-14**]
No focal consolidation, however, there is subtle, ill-defined
asymmetric airspace opacity in the left lower lobe, better
appreciated on the prior abdominal CT, which may represent early
infection, inflammation, and/or aspiration.
.
Portable AP [**3-18**]
The heart and mediastinum are normal. No acute infiltrates are
present. There is a prominent interstitial [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] again seen
suggesting some chronic interstitial process.
.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-3-21**] 10:48 AM
Grossly limited study due to extensive patient motion and early
termination prior to gadolinium administration. Given these
limitations, there is no gross change in findings at L4-L5 from
[**2-15**] exam. Suggest re- examination after sedation to
exclude residual infection at this site.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST [**2175-3-23**]
Pre lim read, no significant change in severe osteo, L4-L5
region Decreased inflammation adjacent to psoas muscle.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo f with chronic L4-L5 osteo/discitis, COPD, HTN, PVD, who
presented with continued osteomyeltis, ARF, hypotension,
diarrhea, and vomiting.
.
#) Hypotension/sepsis: Pt had several sources of infection that
could cause hypotension including worsening L-spine
osteomyelitis, line infection, axillary bifem graft fluid
collection, aspiration pneumonia. However, suspected hypotension
related to severe dehydraton [**2-17**] gastroenteritis. Blood cultures
from [**3-13**] grew 1/4 bottles coag neg staph. She was aggressively
volume repleted. Pt initially required pressors (levophed), but
this was weaned to off prior to transfer to the floor. Her SBP's
remained in the 80's-90's, but she was mentating well and had
excellent [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it was thought that the BP readings may be
erroneous.  CT scan showed intrauterine coil, likely
representing IUD seen on past XR's. During prior admission,
OB-GYN was consulted and stated that given that the string is no
longer palpable, removal would require more invasive attempts
usually performed under anesthesia - therefore rec'd leaving it
in. Was left in. Seroma, psoas myositis stable. Pt was initially
treated with cefepime, linezolid, and flagyl, but this was
changed to vanc prior to transfer to floor, as it was believed
pt did not have active bacterial infecion other than chronic
osteo. Pt's PICC line was pulled given positive blood cultures
(although this was possibly contamination). Not replaced. Pt
afebrile with no diarrhea on floor. C-diff (-) x 3. [**Location (un) 27292**]
virus negative. [**Location (un) 4338**] L spine repeated to assess L4-L5
osteo/discitis. [**3-21**] [**Month/Day (4) 4338**] with movement poor quality film.
Repeated [**3-23**] with no change in osteo, but no evidence of abscess
and some improvement in inflammatory changes adjacent to psoas
muscle.
.
#) L4-L5 osteomyelitis: chronic L4-L5 osteo/discitis. neurosurg
saw pt in ED, recommended non-surgical management. Maintained on
Vancomycin IV throughout admission. Total 12 week course, pt
started [**2174-12-28**]. [**3-21**] [**Month/Day (4) 4338**] with movement poor quality film.
Repeated [**3-23**] with no change in osteo, but no evidence of abscess
and some improvement in inflammatory changes adjacent to psoas
muscle. At discharge to nursing home, no further positive blood
cultures, osteo stable, vancomycin stopped after total 12 week
course of Abx. DC'd on cephalex
