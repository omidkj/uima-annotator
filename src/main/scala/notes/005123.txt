Brief Hospital Course:
59M who had suboccipital craniectomy for evacuation of
cerebellar hemorrhage at [**Hospital1 2177**] in [**2102-7-4**].  He was transferred
to a rehab facility where he had difficulty with ambulation and
was aggitated and combative.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
eval.  CT scan on [**2102-10-10**] showed did not show acute intracranial
hemorrhage, however a fluid collection in the left posterior
fossa craniotomy bed was found.  Repeat CT scan on [**10-11**] showed
showed no interval change in the fluid collection, and the
posterior fossa craniotomy does not appear to contain air and
demonstrates. In addition, 1.6 cm rim-enhancing partially
calcified lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere resection bed
may represent chronic inflammatory changes status post
intracranial hemorrhage, however small tumor could not be
excluded.  MRI was performed on [**10-12**] to follow up CT results,
which showed blood products in the left cerebellum with mild
enhancement of the surrounding area and also extending
inferiorly. The enhancement pattern is unusual for a simple
postoperative enhancement and could be due to underlying
infection or neoplasm. Patient was neurologically stable during
his hospital stay.  Psychiatry was consulted to evaluated the
initial mental status. Psychiatry felt he had improvement in
mental status from admission and behavior could be due to
cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. Psychiatry deemed
patient to be safe and not suicidal.  Physical therapy worked
with patient during hospital stay. Patient is being transferred
in stable condition, afebrile, with interval improvement in
mental status.
