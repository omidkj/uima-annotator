History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2392**] is a 71yo female with PMH significant for ESRD on
HD, respiratory failure, who presents from HD with BRBPR.
Patient was at HD earlier this morning and was noted to have
400cc BRBPR. She was also hypotensive and HD was stopped. Her
blood pressure was 118/80 before her BP dropped. It is unclear
what her BP or how much fluid was removed at this time. Per NH
records, she had quaiac positive BM last night. While in
transport to the ED, she sounded extremely congested per EMS
reports.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.1 BP 80/70 AR 80 RR 24 O2
sat 70% on 50% flowmask. She was placed on 95% high flow mask
and her oxygen saturation increased to 99%. She was noted to
have thick, creamy looking secretions. Given improvement in her
O2 sat, the FIO2 was decreased to 0.50. She received Protonix
80mg IV and 1L NS bolus. She was then transferred to the MICU
for further management.

  RADIOLOGY
==============

CHEST X-RAY ([**2188-9-10**])
FINDINGS: There is a tracheostomy tube that terminates in the
standard
position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is a
left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe. The
right lung does not show any focal consolidations. The tip of
the central venous line is projected over the right atrium.

CONCLUSION:
Left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe,
though focal
consolidation cannot be excluded and followup is advised.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2392**] is a 71yo female with PMH significant for ESRD on
HD, anemia, respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy who is being
transferred to the MICU for LGIB.

1)LGIB: Patient presented with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at
HD. Per her PMH, she has a history of GI bleeding. Differential
diagnosis for LGIB includes hemmoroids, diverticuliosis,
angiodysplasia, colitis (infectious, ischemia, IBD, and
neoplasm. No report of fevers, chills, or diarrhea to suggest an
infectious colitis or IBD.  Most likely diverticulitis vs.
hemorrhoids. Per OMR, she has not had a colonoscopy here. Her
baseline Hct is between 25-30 but her Hct on admission today of
35.5. Her INR and PTT are elevated today.  She is on Aspirin as
an outpatient but is not on any anti-coagulation (in light of
history of atrial fibrillation).

Patients hematocrit remained stable and she did not require any
transfusions. GI consult was obtained and given spontaneous
resolution of bleeding and low expectation for intervation,
colonoscopy was not pursued.

Aspirin was held given on clear indication for therapy was
found, defer further management to PCP.

Heparin prophylaxis dose was adjusted (reduced) from normal
amount, to 2500 SC BID.

2)Hypotension:  Patient was noted to be hypotensive with SBPs in
80??????s, possibly lower at dialysis. Unclear how much fluid was
removed at dialysis. She also had 400cc of BRBPR which may be
accounting for her transient hypotension.  She received 1L NS in
the ED and her BP quickly stabilized and remained at baseline.
No fevers or chills to suggest an underlying infectious process.
 Lactate was elevated to 3.9 but quickly returned to [**Location 213**]. Her
hypotension also resolved upon tranfer to the MICU.

3)Respiratory: Patient has history of respiratory failure s/p
tracheostomy and was successfully weaned in [**1-11**]. Patient was
acutely hypoxic with O2 saturation between 50-70%. She was also
noted to have increased secretions; she likely mucous plugged
given acute desaturation. Her Upon transfer to the MICU, her
respiratory status stabilized.  She is currently on 50%
trachmask.  No evidence of a pneumonia on cxray. Patient had a
single, transient episode of desaturation wich resolved with
suctioning. She has remained with good oxygen saturation the the
trach mask per her baseline. We continued inhaler regimen as per
rehab.

4)Coagulopathy: Patient presented with elevated INR and PTT. She
is not on any anti-coagulation or blood thinners as outpatient.
These labs may have been draw via a line that was flushed with
heparin. This may also be due to heparin SQ she has been
receiving at home. Her labs were repeated and they normalized.
As above, SC heparin for prophylaxis was re-started at a reduced
dose.

5)ESRD on HD: Patient underwent dialysis prior to being
discharged to rehab.

6)COPD: Continue Atrovent and Albuterol

7)Anemia: Baseline Hct between 25-30. Hct on admission was 35,
which is slightly elevated from baseline.  Her Hct remained
stable at 30 during her stay in the MICU. She also receives
Epogen at HD.

8)Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on Levoxyl.
