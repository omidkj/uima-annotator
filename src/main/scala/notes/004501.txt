Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 98592**]
Chief Complaint:
dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 yo F with past medical history of breast cancer,
hypertension, cardiomyopathy now resolved and atrial
fibrillation who is admitted with a segmental RLL PE.
.
The patient presented to the ED on the day of admission after
feeling weak and nauseated after a blood draw for an INR check.
She had approximately 24 hours of diffuse malaise, abdominal
discomfort and bloating as well as dizziness.  She took
pepto-bismol at home which relieved her abdominal discomfort.
In the ED, the patient had one episode of bilious vomiting.
Lactate was within normal limits.  There was concern given her
leukocytosis, malaise and abdominal discomfort for a GI pathogen
so she was covered with levofloxacin 750 mg IV x1 and flagyl 500
mg IV x1.  She was sent for a CTA of her chest as well as a CT
abd/pelvis after she became hypoxic, satting 80s on RA, up to
98% on 4L.  She additionally became tachypneic to the 30s and
tachycardic to 120s per report (though not documented in ED
paperwork).

ECG showing change in p waves, sinus tach. No clinical evidence
of LE DVTs. Cr is up to 1.5, on her second L of fluid. Lactate
1.5. Blood cultures and urine cultures sent.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.9 P 107 BP 108/78 R 18 O2 sat
100% on RA. Patient was given levo/flagyl as above as well as 4
mg Zofran.
On the floor, the patient continues to have some nausea, but no
further episodes of vomiting.  She denies any lightheadedness,
chest pain, pleuritic pain or palpitations.

Imaging:
[**2165-4-5**]:
CXR: Low lung volumes with no acute cardiopulmonary process

[**2165-4-7**]:
CT chest/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. The addendum concurs with the results in the final report
issued
previously on the chest CT. A suboptimal contrast bolus rendered
evaluation
of the distal subsegmental branches incomplete and therefore a
pulmonary
embolism could not be excluded. The patient has had subsequent
chest CTA on
[**2165-4-6**], which demonstrates no pulmonary embolism with a better
contrast
bolus.

2. In addition to the change in the initial wet regarding a
pulmonary
embolism, the pulmonary nodules noted in the CT are stable
relative to a prior
in [**2159**] and therefore there is no suspected metastatic
involvement of the
lungs.

3. Findings are consistent with a high-grade small-bowel
obstruction likely
due to adhesion at the midline of a presumed prior hysterectomy
incision. The
preliminary results to this effect were provided by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 1:30 p.m.
on [**2165-4-7**]. At that point, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], of the clinical team,
inform Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
that she had subsequently advanced her diet and was passing
flatus and
therefore likely spontaneously reduced. Nonetheless, the imaging
findings are
striking. There are no features of intestinal ischemia on the
current study.
A surgical consultation nonetheless is likely advised, now on a
more nonurgent
outpatient basis unless symptoms again arise.

As the patient had already been discharged at the time of
addendum, the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was
informed of these
results at 8:45 pm on [**2165-4-7**].

[**2165-4-6**] CTA chest
1. No evidence of pulmonary emboli.

2. Similar patchy ground-glass opacities and many sub-5-mm
nodules which are not significantly changed.


Brief Hospital Course:
# ?Pulmonary embolism:  Patient presented intially with nausea
and lightheadedness.  Due to transient hypoxia on room air in
the emergency department, a Chest CTA was obtained.  Although
the bolus was inappropriately timed, there was concern for PE.
This was concerning given that she has breast cancer, had a
recent TAH-BSO and was therapeutic on coumadin for Atrial
Fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU and started on heparin
drip. A repeat CTA was performed and there was no evidence of
PE.  Therefore, the decision was made that the patient should
remain on coumadin and did not need an IVC filter.  An echo was
performed and did not show RV dysfuction. she was transferred to
the medicine floor where she remained on telemetry and was
hemodynamically stable. Her coumadin dose was continued per home
regimen.
.
# Nausea/vomiting.  She developed nausea in the ED which
improved with zofran. She was given IVF and a CT abd/pelvis was
performed initially read as negative for concerning findings.
The patients was continued on IV fluids until she was able to
tolerated po. She continued to have intermittent episodes of
nausea, but no vomiting or diarrhea. She was passing flatus.
Once she was able to tolerate food, she was discharged home with
outpatient follow-up. The day post-discharge, her provider was
informed by radiology that the CT A/P did show a small bowel
obstruction on admission, that appeared to have resolved during
her stay. Her PCP was informed, and the patient was contact[**Name (NI) **] to
ensure proper follow-up and further treatment if needed.

# ARF.  Patient presented with pre-renal acute renal failure and
lightheadedness.  This responded to IVF.  ARF was likely
secondary to dehydration, though patient did not report a clear
history of poor PO intake.  She did have an episode of vomiting
in the ED. Her electrolytes and creatinine returned to baseline
prior to discharge.
