Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Metoprolol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central Line placement


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 89 male with PMH sig for Parkinson's disease, AF, CHF (EF
35-40%), hx of aspiration requiring close monitoring during
feeding pureed substances, presented to ED with CC of dyspnea.
He was in his usual state of health until end of last week. His
family noted that he had slightly increased wheezing and SOB.
The course was intermittent and did not worsen immediately. His
respiratory status stablized over the weekand. He continued to
do well until this afternoon around 4-5pm. He had increased
wheezing and dyspnea. He also had increasing cough as well. He
was fed some ice cream and subseuqently developed respiratory
distress and cough. His respiratory status settle down a little
bit. He then went to the bathroom, where he was found later by
his family to have much worsened respiratory status.
.
The family (including daughters and wife) denied that he had
other complaints over the last several days. Denies fever,
chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain, exertional
dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea or dysuria.
.
Of note, he was admitted in [**2185-12-31**] w/ cellulits of left leg
ulceration with [**Date Range 109815**] exposure. His leg film was negative for
osteomyelitis. He was seen by plastics, who felt that pt. should

have evaluation of vascularity to area of wound. Then, he was
seen by vascular surgery. Vascular surgery recommeded MRA to
determine feasibility of revascularization procedure. After
discussion within family, decided to defer MRA. He was treated
with vancomycin. His erythema, warmth, and tenderness to
palpation improved. On discharge. He was discharged w/ vascular
and plastic f/u. He was d/c on [**1-9**] w/ 4 more doses of vanco
over next 8 days. He finished vancomycin course on [**1-17**].
.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt was given dose of IV metoprolol 5 mg which caused some
resultant hypotension. However the hypotension persisted hours
after the single dose of metoprolol infusion. He did not respond
to IVF challenge and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on Dpamine drip.

Pertinent Results:
Portable AP chest x-ray was obtained and compared to the
previous film from [**2186-1-18**], and [**2186-1-17**].

The ETT tube is inserted with its tip projecting 2.6 cm above
the carina. The cuff of the ETT tube looks to be overinflated
with distention of the proximal trachea.

The NG tube is in good position. The right subclavian catheter
is inserted with its tip projecting over the superior vena cava.

The extensive consolidation seen in the right lung as well as in
the left lower lobe may represent an overlying pneumonia in
addition to a known congestive heart failure. No significant
change in the lung opacification is present except for slight
improvement of the left lower lung consolidation.

IMPRESSION:

1. Status post insertion of the ETT tube with overinflation of
cuff. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
during dictating the exam.

2. Satisfactory position of NG tube and right subclavian
catheter.

3. Slight improvement of the left lower lobe consolidation.
Otherwise, no significant changes in comparison to the previous
study.

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images

available) of [**2185-1-14**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal  technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully  excluded. Mild global LV
hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity. [Intrinsic RV
systolic function  likely more depressed given the severity of
TR]. Abnormal septal  motion/position consistent with RV
pressure/volume overload.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**11-28**]+)  MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate to severe  [3+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.  There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular  systolic function is
mildly depressed (estimated ejection fraction ?45%). The  right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. [Intrinsic right
ventricular  systolic function is likely more depressed given
the severity of tricuspid  regurgitation.] There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right  ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
 The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets  are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.  The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]  tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial  effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of  [**2185-1-14**], no definite segmental wall motion
abnormalities were identified in  the current study. Left
ventricular systolic function may now be more rigorous  but
prior images not available for comparison. Right ventricular
size and  function were not described in the [**2185-1-14**] report
(depressed RV function was  noted in the [**2185-6-7**] TEE report).
