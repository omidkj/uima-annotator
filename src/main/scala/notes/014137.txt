Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, OSH transfer for PE.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
64 yo man with h/o COPD presented to OSH complaining of SOB on
exertion that had started on Thursday evening. His breathing
improved with rest, but he contined to have DOE over the
weekend. Earlier in the day on Monday, he felt that he was
unable to catch his breath even at rest and he decided to go to
the ER. He also has noticed that his right ankle was swollen,
the full time like on his ankle swelling is not clear, but he
reports he first officially noticed it on Sunday.
At the OSH, he was found to be tachycardia to the 120s with an
o2 say of 88%. LENIs were reportedly negative. A CTA showed a
"large saddle embolus, involving all lobes, likely small L lower
lobe infarct." He was then started on a heparin gtt (80 mg/kg
bolus, then 18 mg/kg drip; guaiac negative as per report) and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. VS on transfer were HR 115s, SBP 130-140
and stable, and O2 sat of 92% on 2L.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, T 98.1 HR 120 BP 96/57 RR 16 O2
sat 95% 6L NC. He denied current CP or SOB at rest, but
continues to have DOE and desatted to the 80s. He denies recent
trauma, travel or a decrease in ambulation. He has been
afebrile, but has been endorsing a dry cough. A bedside echo was
done which was significant for RV strain, with RA dilatation.
His BP remained stable and he was admitted to the ICU.
.
On the floor, he is resting comfortably and in no acute
distress. He continues to deny CP or current SOB. He denies
recent pleuritic CP, F/C, N/V, abd pain, calf pain. No h/o clots
in the past and no family history of clots. He reports a chronic
cough productive of whitish sputum that is unchanged.
.

Report from OSH - CTA: Extensive b/l pulmonary emboli with large
amount of clot noted within the distal R main pulmonary artery.
Clot is noted in the pulmonary bifurcation c/w cell embolism.
Faint opacity in the LLL may reprent small infarction.  Minimal
emphysematous changes b/l.  Multiple tortuous vessels in the LUQ
suggests varices.  Focal area of low attenuation in the spleen.

Report from OSH - R-LENI: negative for DVT

CXR [**10-20**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process
.
ECHO [**10-21**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal
hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Agitated saline contrast study is consistent with the presence
of an intracardiac shunt (likely stretched patent formamen ovale
or small atrial septal defect).
.
[**10-21**] RUQ u/s:
IMPRESSION:
1. 2.6 x 2.9 x 4.3 cm left hepatic lobe mass, equivocally seen
on the
single-phase reference CT examination from [**2104-10-20**]. An
abdominal MR examination is recommended for further evaluation
of this lesion.
2. Coarse liver echotexture, which may represent fatty
infiltration or
cirrhosis/fibrosis.
3. Splenomegaly.
