History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old woman presented to an outside hospital
with 3 days of dyspnea.  She noted a few days of decreased urine
output and and gradually worsening SOB/wheezing, shaking chills,

[**2132-1-18**] EEG
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Rare left anterior temporal sharp waves were
noted in
the drowsy state.
BACKGROUND: A [**12-1**] Hz posterior predominant rhythm was noted in
the
waking state, which attenuated with eye opening.
YPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to possible stroke.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced symmetric driving, but
no
activation of the record.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from the waking to drowsy state,
and
attained stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A generally regular rhythm was noted, with an
average
rate of 78-84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping
states
due to the left temporal sharp waves in the drowsy state. This
suggests
left temporal cortical hypersynchrony. No definitely
epileptiform
discharges or regions of focal slowing were noted.

[**1-17**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Improving left lower lobe and lingular opacities,
likely due to atelectasis. Persistent small pleural effusions,
left greater than right.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. The IVC
is normal in
diameter with >50% decrease collapse during respiration
(estimated RAP [**5-29**]
mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderately
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. RV function
depressed.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Focal
calcifications in ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets (3). No AS.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Trivial MR. Normal LV inflow
pattern for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal
tricuspid valve
supporting structures. Mild [1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(ejection farction
30-40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum,
anterior free
wall, and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic
valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
