81 mg p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  2.
Congestive heart failure.  3.  Myocardial infarction.  4.
Coronary artery disease.  5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6.  Hematuria.  7.  Hyperlipidemia.  8.  Left hydronephrosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old
gentleman with congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction, benign prostatic
hypertrophy and hematuria, who presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with complaints of chest pressure
and pain, relieved in the Emergency Room by nitroglycerin and
oxygen.

The patient was seen in the hospital two weeks prior to this
admission with hematuria.  A cystoscopy was performed under
anesthesia, which revealed bleeding around the prostate.
Three points of bleeding were coagulated, however, bleeding
restarted by the time of current patient presentation.  The
patient also has known coronary artery disease and was
planned to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting, however,
the surgery was postponed due to the patient's gross
hematuria.  No evidence of tumor.  The patient was admitted
for chest pain, ischemia, gross hematuria and possible
coronary artery bypass grafting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a blood pressure of 124/58 and pulse 67.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  S1 and S2
normal, no murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.  Genitourinary:  Urine
grossly bloody.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission prothrombin time was 15.5, INR 1,
partial thromboplastin time 38.1, troponin 0.04, CK 46,
digoxin level 0.6, white blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit
26.4, platelet count 255,000, sodium 142, potassium 3.9,
chloride 109, bicarbonate 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.5 and
glucose 107.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the patient's hematuria, decrease in
hematocrit since his last admission, and known coronary
artery disease, he was admitted to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  Urology was consulted and a three way Foley
catheter was placed.  Continuous bladder irrigation was
started.  The patient was transfused two units of blood for a
low hematocrit.

On hospital day number two, the patient felt well.  He was
receiving ciprofloxacin prophylactically for his urinary
tract problems.  [**Name (NI) **] was transferred to a regular floor in
stable condition.

On hospital day number three, the patient remained afebrile
with stable vital signs.  Hematocrit was stable at 36.  Liver
function tests were normal.  The patient's family contact[**Name (NI) **]
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and reported episodes of confusion in the
patient in the past.

A neurology consult was obtained.  Neurology thought that the
patient might have a frontotemporal dementia and recommended
a CT scan as well as carotid ultrasound due to the patient's
potentially high risk for stroke, especially during surgery.
A CT scan of the head was performed and no abnormalities
were found.  On hospital day number four, a duplex carotid
ultrasound was performed, with no significant stenosis.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2154-9-6**], where coronary artery bypass grafting times two
(saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal) was performed.
Pacing wires and mediastinal chest tubes were placed
intraoperatively.  The operation went without complications
and the patient was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care
Unit in stable condition and then to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day number one, the patient did well.  He
was slowly weaned off the ventilator and was extubated
overnight on postoperative day number two.  On postoperative
day number three, the patient remained stable.  He continues
to show gross blood in his continuous bladder irrigations.
He was started on beta blockers.

On postoperative day number four, the patient was doing well
and was transferred to a regular floor in stable condition.
On the floor, the patient had a very short episode of atrial
fibrillation.  He did not require conversion or rate control.
His Lopressor was increased to 50 mg twice a day, which the
patient tolerated well.

On postoperative day number five, the patient remained on
Lopressor without episodes of atrial fibrillation.  His wires
were removed.  There was a small amount of blood from one of
the wire removal sites, which spontaneously stopped.  The
patient was on bed rest, serial examinations and vital signs
checks, which remained stable, with no more bleeding.

The patient continued to be stable and there are no issues at
this point.  The urology service was consulted and stated
that they would remove the patient's Foley catheter and stop
continuous bladder irrigation prior to the patient's
discharge from the hospital.  Long term planning will be done
at a later date.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility.
