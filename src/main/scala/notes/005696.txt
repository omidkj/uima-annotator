Pertinent Results:
[**2175-8-30**] cardiac cath:
Selective coronary angiography of this codominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
calcified without angiographically-apparent flow-limiting
disease.  The LAD had proximal calcification.  There was a focal
80% stenosis at the first septal branch.  The LAD had a mid 80%
stenosis.  There was a 50-60% stenosis at the origin of D1.  The
origin of the LCx had a 50-60% stenosis.  There was a 70%
stenosis at the distal OM bifurcation.  The RCA had a diffuse
proximal 90% stenosis with slow flow to the PDA.

[**2175-9-5**] echo:
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. The MR is now
mild. The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

CXR: [**2175-9-8**]
Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
patient
is status post CABG with sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
that are
intact and in similar position to [**2175-9-7**].  Right IJ
central line terminates in the low svc.  New left uppe zone
ill-defined opacity may represent atelectasis, but infection or
aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
stetting.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right
are similar to prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
IMPRESSION: Ill-defined left upper zone new opacity, compatible
with atelectasis, although in the correct clinical setting,
infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40284**] was taken to the operating room on [**2175-9-5**] and
underwent CABG x 4 (LIMA to LAD, RSVG to R PDA, RSVG to OM, RSVG
to D1. Immediately postoperative he was transfer to the CVICU,
where he was extubated and weaned off pressors.  On POD 1, he
was transferred to the floor.  Chest tubes were removed on POD
2.  Wires were removed on POD 3.  He was evaluated by PT and
cleared for home.  He was gently diuresed toward his
preoperative weights. His blood sugars continued to be elevated
165-200's.  His metformin was restarted.  He was discharged home
with an Rx for a Glucometer and supplies to monitor his blood
sugars and instructions to follow-up with [**Hospital **] Clinic in
[**Location (un) 8117**] NH.  On the day of discharge, he was hemodynamically
stable, tolerating a diabetic diet, ambulating, and his pain was
well controlled on a PO regimen.
