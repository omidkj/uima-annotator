U/A ([**9-10**]): 30 Protein, small leukocytes, 20 RBCs, 12 WBCs, few
bacteria
UCx:  Negative x2

EKG [**2112-9-7**]: Sinus tachycardia. Otherwise, within normal limits.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-1-5**] diffuse T wave
flattening, which was previously seen, has largely resolved.
Heart rate is faster. The other findings are similar.
.
CT neck/abdomen [**2112-9-9**]: 1)SVC occlusion w/ possible thrombus
extending to rt atrium. Extensive collaterals and prominent
azygous/hemiazygous. 2) stable appearance of small bowel/colon
without evidence of obstruction. 3) stable mediastinal/hilar
adenopathy 4) bilat axillary lymph nodes w/ haziness of
surrounding fat, uncertain etiology.
.
CXR [**2112-9-9**]: No pneumothorax. No new air space consolidation or
effusion. The patient will be undergoing CTA of the chest.
.
KUB [**2112-9-7**]: No obstructive bowel gas pattern.

ECHO ([**2112-9-10**]):  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium
(best excluded by TEE). Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2112-4-13**], the aortic valve leaflets now appear
mildly thickened (non-specific).

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 52 y.o female with h/o Crohn's dx s/p multiple
complications, and h/o SVC syndrome who presents with facial
swelling and acute on chronic abdominal pain.
.
#. SVC syndrome: Pt has a h/o SVC syndrome in [**2101**] and presented
with facial swelling for one day and pain upon flushing her
port. Chest CT on [**2112-9-9**] revealed SVC clot to R.atrium with
extensive collaterals to the azygous vein.  Patient was
evaluated by vascular surgery and Cardiothoracic surgery in the
ED, and both felt that she was not a surgical candidate at this
time, as her collaterals suggested a non-acute nature.  The
patient has a history of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on Argatroban
in the ED.  This was discontinued on [**9-11**].  Patient was started
on Coumadin on [**9-11**], and her INR was 3.1 at discharge (on 5 mg
daily).  Patient has a follow-up appointment with the
