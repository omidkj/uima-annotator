History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23919**] is a 57 year old man with a history of paranoid
schizophrenia, prior left frontoparietal infarct, tardive
dyskinesia, and seizures, who was found to be seizing in his bed
this evening.  He lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility, and was
seen at supper around 5 p.m. according to the receptionist
taking calls this evening. Between 7 and 7:30 p.m.
one of the care assistants went to his room to check on him and
saw that he was seizing (reportedly generalized tonic-clonic).
Unfortunately no one from the facility is available to provide
any further details at present, but the receptionist said she
does not think he has been sick lately.  EMS was called and he
was given 4 mg Ativan en route, but continued to exhibit
episodic right gaze deviation and nystagmus upon arrival to the
ED.  He received another 2 mg of Ativan, then was intubated and
sedated
with propofol, at which point no further seizure activity was
observed.  The propofol had to be held due to hypotension, and
since he has been off propofol he has not had recurrence of
seizure activity.  He is in the midst of a load with 1g Dilantin
IV.

It is not known if there have been any recent changes to Mr.
[**Known lastname 23920**] medications.  He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Behavioral
Neurology, but at his last appointment in [**2118-4-9**] he did not
bring a list of his medications.  Per his facility he currently
takes Trileptal 300 mg [**Hospital1 **]. His last seizure was in [**Month (only) 359**] of
[**2117**].  At that time he had an EEG that revealed a slow
background
with occasional bursts of generalized slowing, as well as
occasional left temporal theta slowing.

Review of systems: Per the receptionist at his facility tonight,
he has not been sick, but it is really unknown if he has had any
fever, URI symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or neurologic
smptoms.  There is some concern that he may have aspirated this
evening during the seizure.

Head CT:
Study limited by patient motion.  No evidence of hemorrhage or
significant change from prior.

CXR:
Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube
in appropriate position with tip approximately 4 cm above the
carina.  A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  The
heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
limits.  The lung parenchyma is clear.  There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Borderline left axis deviation. Possible left
anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2117-10-26**] no diagnostic change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 57 year old man with history of seizure disorder,
paranoid schizophrenia, prior left frontoparietal infarct,
tardive dyskinesia, who had a prolonged seizure lasting at least
30 minutes (time of onset is unclear) considered to be status at
admission. He required total of Ativan 6mg and
intubation/Propofol to stop seizure. He was admitted to
Neurology ICU for further management.
The triggering event, e.g. medication, infection, etc. is
unclear.  Extensive work up for possible cause was done. Only
one thing that we could suggest was a relatiely low dose of
Trileptal (all cultures were negative so far).  There is no
evidence of a new intracranial process.  He has an elevated wbc,
and there is concern for an aspiration event this evening, but
so far CXR and UA are not remarkable.  He has received
Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the ED.

He was admitted to Neurology ICU with Dilantin loaded and
Trileptal was increased up to 600 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was successfully
extubated and remained stable respiratory wise.
He did not have further seizure events after admission. He
returned to his baseline, except he had difficulty in
ambulation, which he required further [**Hospital 23923**] rehabilitation.

His neurological examination after recover, was unchanged to the
pre-episode. We contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Behavioral Neurologist,
patient's primary neurologist) and made appointment for follow
up in [**2-11**] weeks.
In the meantime, he knew that he should come to ED if any
suspicious episode for seizure, change in his neurological
condition, such as difficulty in speech, change in vision,
hearing, new weakness, numbness.
