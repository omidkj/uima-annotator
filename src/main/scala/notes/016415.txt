History of Present Illness:
72F AFib, HTN, breast and thyroid CA, s/p tracheostomy several
years ago after breast cancer surgery and hysterectomy
presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with respiratory distress and
fever. EMS crew arrived on scene to find her in respiratory
distress, with a heart rate of 180, febrile although temperature
not documented. Patient was in atrial flutter versus atrial
fibrillation per EMS report. She was saturating at 75-80% on her
trach collar without any supplemental oxygen when EMS arrived,
was put on a nonrebreather blow by into the trach collar and
quickly raised her saturations to the mid 90s.  Of note patient
recently was evaluated for cough and fever with CXR done at
[**Hospital3 **] that showed possible early PNA, started on avelox
on [**3-4**], but either did not receive this at all or not a full
course per [**Hospital3 **] staff.  UTI recently dx, on cipro
starting [**3-2**], completed 3 day course.  Per family has lived in
[**Hospital3 **] for about 6 months.  Looked well on Monday when
they saw her.
.
In the ED, she was quickly put on the ventilator with 5 of PEEP
50% FiO2 and raised her oxygen yet further to 97. Copious blood
tinged purulent secretions were noted from trach on arrival.
CXR with multiple opacities noted, RUL most prominent,
concerning for multifocal PNA.  UA concerning for UTI so pt was
started on vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin.  Temp noted to
be 101.2 in ED, given 650 mg of tylenol x 2.  Exam notable for
rhonchi throughout lung fields.  Also received IV NS.  HR on
arrival was HR on arrival was 138 Aflutter or afib per report, w
BP 130s-140s systolic.  Around 10:20 AM pt converted to sinus
rhythm with subsequent decrease in BP to 90's systolic, bolus of
IV NS given with improvement.  VS on transfer BP 107/48 MAP 62
HR 56 on CPAP 10/5 with 50% FiO2.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt is nonverbal but shakes head no when
asked if she has any pain, looks comfortable.  Pt is still on
CPAP 10/5, weaned down to 5/0.

New multifocal opacities worrisome for multifocal pneumonia,
although an unusual pattern of asymmetric edema could also be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Persistent

Brief Hospital Course:
72F AFib, HTN, breast and thyroid CA, s/p tracheostomy several
years ago presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with respiratory
distress and fever, UTI, multifocal PNA
.
# Respiratory distress:  Most likely in setting of multifocal
PNA.  Pt with h/o tracheostomy placement after thyroid surgery
and lumpectomy, normally on trach collar but initially required
CPAP ventilation when admitted. Covered for HCAP with
vancomycin, zosyn for 10 day course, requiring PICC line
insertion.
.
# UTI: UA suggestive of UTI, culture showing pansensitive
Klebsiella. Covered by vanc/zosyn.
.
# Afib:  RVR initially on admission and prior to transfer to
medical [**Hospital1 **]. Now resolved, most likely in setting of illness
and having had her AV nodal blockers held on admission. Not on
warfarin. Continued outpatient doseing of metoprolol, diltiazem,
and aspirin.  Telemetry monitor misread her as having rapid
heart rate, and was disconcordant with same time EKG showing
good rate control in 50-60s.
.
# breast cancer: cont home anastrozole
.
# depression and psychosis: cont perphenazine
.
# blindness: cont eye drops from home
.
# hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine
.
# Code = DNR, ok to intubate.
