Studies:
[**2170-8-20**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature depolarizations.
Borderline left axis deviation. Possible left anterior
fascicular block. Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-7-25**] no major change.
.
[**2170-8-20**] CXR PA & LAT FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral views of
the chest were obtained. The study is limited by
underpenetration due to body habitus. Lung volumes are low, but
stable in comparison to [**2170-7-25**]. The lungs are clear, without
focal airspace consolidation or effusion. Cardiac size is
stable. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. Hilar
structures are normal.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process within the
limitations of the
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with anemia, obstructive sleep apnea and a
history of pulmonary embolisms who presented with increasing
somnolence and mild dyspnea that improved after holding all
narcotics and resuming BiPAP overnight.
.
1. Somnolence: Initially the patient was placed in the MICU due
to her hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Her home narcotic use
for chronic pain and her recent non-use of her BiPAP machine at
home likely contributed to her somnolence.   Initially narcotics
were held and the patient was put back on BiPAP and she became
more alert.  She was transfered to the floor and narcotics were
tapered per the recommendations of the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she
remained alert for the remainder of her hospitalization.
.
2. Dypsnea: The patient's initial dyspnea was likely related to
ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive
sleep apnea.  Despite the patient's history of pulmonary emboli,
there was low concern for this because she did not have acute
hypoxia, she has an IVC filter, and she had a supratherapeutic
INR on admission.  Her dypsnea resolved with nebulizers and
BiPAP therapy.  She maintained good oxygen saturation and had no
further shortness of breath for the duration of her
hospitalization.
.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), Recurrent: The patient had a
positive urine analysis on admission and had a recent admission
with a UTI growing pan-sensitive E. coli, although she does have
a history of resistant UTIs.  She was started on ciprofloxacin
empirically for her UTI, and then changed to cefpodoxime 3 days
later when sensitivities showed that the E. coli UTI was
resistant to ciprofloxacin and sensitive to ceftriaxone.  The
patient was afebrile without a remarkable white count throughout
her admission.  She had no symptoms of dysuria.  She received 2
days of cefpodoxime while hospitalized and was discharged on 8
additional days of treatment for a total of 10 days of therapy
for complicated/recurrent UTIs.
.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient has a history of
Stage III chronic kidney disease secondary to high dose loop
diuretics and metolazone.  She is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as
an outpatient.  Her baseline creatinine is 1.0-1.5.  It was
elevated to 2.1 on admission.  Urine lytes were
