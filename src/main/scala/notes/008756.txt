Shortness of breath and weight gain

Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 62 yo man with a h/o cardiomyopathy, AFib, CRI, and
DM who presented to OSH with LGIB and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for acute renal failure. Patient originally presented to
[**State 20192**] Center on [**7-17**] with a LGIB.
Patient was found to have an elevated TnI and Cr. The patient
has a long history of chronic kidney disease with CHF and a
baseline EF of 35%. Diuresis with Lasix was attempted at the
OSH, but patient responded poorly to increasing doses of loop
diuretics and HCTZ. Patient underwent Tesio placement on [**2146-7-28**]
and has been dialyzed every day since this time. His Cr has
decreased from 4.4 to 2.4, and his oxygen requirement has
decreased as well. Patient is currently stable and has been
transferred for further dialysis and evaluation.

Patient states that his weight has increased over the past few
weeks, and he has had significant difficulty breathing. He has
had LLE cellulitis since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]. He
states that that last time that he was ambulatory he was 290lbs.
He was admitted in the evening of [**2146-8-3**] and diuresis was
attempted with increasing doses of lasix gtt. However despite
lasix gtt at 25mg/hr and diuril 500mg q8 the patient continued
to be fluid positive (>600 cc+ on the 24hrs prior to CCU
transfer). He was transferred for elective initiation of CVVH
for volume control.

Patient received CVVH in the CCU for two days.  He then began to
receive ultrafiltration and has had ~ 8L removed since [**8-7**].
Patient has continued to have minimal UOP.  Patient's pacemaker
was interrogated by EP, and he was found to be in AFib since
[**2146-7-18**].

PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-8-4**] at 3:45:00 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis and inferior
akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is moderately dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Dilated right ventricle with
moderate systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary hypertension.

 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-8-9**] 1:00 PM
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2146-7-5**].
The double-lumen catheter was inserted through right internal
jugular vein
with its tip terminating in distal SVC. The pacemaker leads
terminate in
right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiomegaly is unchanged,
moderate.   The vascular engorgement is moderate representing
volume overload/mild pulmonary edema. No obvious pneumothorax is
demonstrated. Small bilateral pleural effusion cannot be
excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: Patient is a 62 yo man with a h/o CHF, paroxysmal
AFib, and CKI who presents from OSH with fluid overload and
shortness of breath.

#. Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has a history of CHF and
has been admitted to the hospital multiple times in the past few
months for CHF exacerbation. In the OSH, patient was noted to be
unresponsive to medical management and was thus started on
hemodialysis for fluid overload. On physical exam, patient had
elevated JVP, lower extremity edema, and had gained upwards of
above his dry weight.  Diuresis had not been achieved with
aggressive Lasix gtt with synergistic thiazide diuretic, so he
has needed HD for volume control.  Patient initially received
CVVH and then was transitioned to normal hemodialysis.
Approximately 4-5L of ultrafiltration was achieved at each
hemodialysis.  He is estimated to have an additional 10-20L of
excess fluid upon discharge.  In addition to hemodialysis for
volume control he was continued on Metoprolol at 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
was fluid restricted to 1000 cc daily.  He had a heart-healthy,
renal, low-Na diet.   Digoxin was decreased given elevated
levels and he was discharged on QOD dosing.

# AFib/Tachy-brady Syndrome: Patient has a h/o paroxysmal AFib
s/p conversion. Patient was on amiodarone and had a permanent
pacemaker placed in [**2146-1-18**]. Patient was found to be in
AFib since [**2146-7-18**]. While in atrial fibrillation his pulse
generally ranged 70-80 BPM.   He then developed several days of
increasing episodes of NSVT.  Electrolytes were within normal
limits and patient was asymptommatic.  Given increased frequency
and length of VT runs, the patient was started on Amiodarone 200
mg [**Hospital1 **] since [**2146-8-12**].   Since starting Amiodarone, patient
converted out of atrial fibrillation and is now in an A-V paced
rythm upon discharge.   In additi
