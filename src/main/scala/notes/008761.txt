Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical ventilation and intubation
Central venous line placement
Tunneled line placement
Hemodialysis
Fasciotomies x 2


History of Present Illness:
49M with past medical history significant for asthma, GERD,
multiple psychiatric problems, heavy alcoholism and new lung
nodule presents from outside hospital in rhabdomyolysis, renal
failure, shock requiring 2 pressors of unknown etiology, as well
as depressed mental status.
.
Interval history reveals that apparently the wife found him this
morning lying in the bathtub, where he apparently slept
overnight after being involved in a domestic dispute. She found
that he had taken more doses of his prescription meds than
should, including all of his fluoxetine, ativan, ambien, and
Neurontin, and naproxen, and doxepin [**1-3**] pills and he was again
not responsive. He was taken to outside hospital where he was
unresponsive and so was intubated for airway protection. Trauma
CXR pelv there negative, as were head and C-spine CT (unknown
whether trauma was involved initially). His labs there showed an
anion gap acidosis, with rhabdomyolysis (CK of about 10,000),
potassium of 7.1 EKG changes for which he was given calcium,
insulin, bicarbonate.
.
Arrived to our emergency department on dopamine and we have fed,
with a wide complex EKG (QRS 170) and potassium of 6.5. He
required 2 amps of calcium, bicarbonate, and after bicarbonate
his QRS narrowed dramatically.
.
Bedside echocardiogram and shock ultrasound revealed
hyperdynamic ventricular function, normal caliber aorta, IVC
which appeared very compressible with respiratory variability
indicating under resuscitation. He was aggressively fluid
resuscitated and subsequently weaned off the dopamine during his
ED stay.
.
Prior to transfer he dropped his pressures and was restarted on
dopamine and levophed.
.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated.
.
Wife says he has had no access to over the counter medications
specifically denying benadryl.

.
ECG [**1-7**]: Wide complex tachycardia with left bundle-branch block
morphology and left superior axis suggestive of supraventricular
tachycardia with intraventricular conduction delay. However,
cannot exclude ventricular tachycardia or accelerated
idioventricular rhythm. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
ECG [**1-12**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads. Compared to tracing #1 atrial ectopy
is new. QRS voltage in the precordial leads is increased.
.
LENI [**1-9**]:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis seen in either
leg. Note is
made of some fluid tracking in the region of the left popliteal
fossa. Note
is also made of prior left lower leg amputation.
.
Head CT [**1-11**]: 1. New hypodensity in the genu of the left
internal capsule is suggestive of an acute infarction. A
dedicated brain MRI is recommended for further evaluation. 2.
Ethmoidal and sphenoidal mucosal thickening with air-fluid
levels and aerosolized secretions is suggestive of acute
sinusitis.
.
TTE [**1-12**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage
ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast at restx2 (late bubbles are seen at 5 beats c/w
transpulmonic passage). Global left ventricular systolic
function is normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch
and descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
discrete vegetations are seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The anterior mitral valve leaflet is mildly thickened, but
without discrete vegetation. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within normal limits). There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis seen.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Normal biventricular
function.
.
Carotid U/S [**1-13**]: Duplex was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. No significant plaque is seen bilaterally.
.
CT Abdomen [**1-15**]
1. Small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the right
lower
quadrant. No evidence for free air or bowel ischemia.
2. Nodular consolidative opacities seen at the right lung base
are likely
representative of developing pneumonia.
3. Distended gallbaldder with enhancing wall and surrounding
fluid may be
related to volume status. However, if there is clinical concern
for
cholecystitis a HIDA scan should be obtained.
4. Small trace bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis.
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**1-18**]
1. Widespread multifocal pneumonia involving primarily right
lung but also
left upper lobe.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Segment [**Do
