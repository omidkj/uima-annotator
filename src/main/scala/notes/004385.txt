History of Present Illness:
83F with MMP in USOH until 6pm on DOA when, at an outdoor fair,

CTA: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

     2) Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions
representing mild left ventricular failure.

     3) Patchy opacities in right middle and lingular lobes.
Differentials include pneumonia or aspiration

Head CT:  No hemorrhage or mass effect

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes are nonspecific
Repolarization changes may be partly due to rate

Echo:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired
relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot
be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure: she was intubated on transfer from
outside hospital.  Chest xray showed evidence of CHF; she had no
signs or symptoms of infection, making pneumonia unlikely.  She
was admitted to the ICU and was maintained initially on pressure
controlled ventilation for 1 day.  Meanwhile, she was treated
with ceftriaxone/azithromycin to cover for possible PNA.  She
was diuresed with lasix, and her respiratory function improved
so that she was weaned off the ventilator on hospital day #2,
and was transferred to the general Medicine team.  At this time,
it was clear that she had no active PNA, and antibiotics were
DC.  She was maintained on lasix throughout her admission, with
no further respiratory distress during her hospital stay.  At
DC, she was breathing comfortably and maintaining good
peripheral O2 saturation on room air.

2. CAD: ACS was ruled out by normal biomarkers and EKG.  She was
maintained on her outpatient regimen of ASA and lipitor, and
showed no signs of cardiac ischemia during her hosptial stay.

3. HTN: blood pressure was normal upon admission, so her outpt
anti-hypertensive meds were held.  Her BP was stable and normal
throughout her stay; she was discharged on no anti-hypertensive
meds, and was instructed to follow-up with her Cardiologist to
address the need for reinstituting medical therapy for HTN.

4. CHF:  her respiratory failure was thought to be [**12-26**] CHF.  She
was maintained on lasix for diuresis throughout her admission,
and her respiratory status improved steadily.  Echocardiogram
showed normal LVEF with diastolic dysfunction and moderate
pulmonary hypertension, which was likely responsible for her
symptoms.  At DC, she is breathing comfortably with minimal
peripheral edema.  She will require close follow-up with her
Cardiologist to manage CHF.

5. DM2: she was hyperglycemic on admission; her outpt meds were
held and she was maintained on an insulin drip in the MICU for
glucose control.  On transfer to the general Medicine service,
insulin drip was DC and her oral hypoglycemic medications were
added to her regimen.  Blood glucose was well-controlled on
glyburide and pioglitazone during her admission, though
metformin was held.  At DC, she was instructed to continue
taking her outpt meds at her usual dose, including metformin.
