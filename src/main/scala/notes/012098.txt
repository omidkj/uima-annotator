Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Erythromycin Base / Naprosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Heart Catheterization
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old man hx of CAD and likely prior
IMI, HTN, AF (on coumadin,) hypercholesterolemia, s/p right
fem-tib popliteal aneurysm transfered for cath after presenting
w/ CP. the patient has a hx of CAD, s/p angioplasty 10 years
prior. In [**3-21**], patinet underwent a EST as part of pre-op
evalution, which showed inferior and lateral wall ischemia with
an EF of 60%. Decision was made to treat with conservative
medical manegment. The patient underwent a right proximal
superficial femoral to distal posterior tibial bypass with non
reversed saphenous vein angioscopy and ligation of femoral and
popliteal aneurysms on [**2127-4-1**] complicated by PE.

4 days prior to presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] the patinet was at home in
his usual state of health when he had sudden onset of substernal
chest pressure while watching the red sox game. The pressure was
described as [**7-22**] without radiation. He denies assoicated
shortness of breath, n/v, diaphoresis, palpitations, or
lightheadedness. The patient took his own blood pressure, and
noted it to be 176 systolic. The chest pain continued for a few
hours; he decided to activate EMS and was brought to [**Hospital **] hospital. Chest pain was relieved with SLNG.

At the OSH, the patient reportendly had an unremarkable EKG and
negative cardiac markers negative x 3. He was given ASA 325mg,
metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **], and plavix. Because of his elevated INR
(1.9,) his coumadin was held, and the patient was transfered
after his INR drifted down.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization upon transfer,
showing 3VD, 80% mid LAD, 60% Lcx, 90% prox ramus, and 80% osial
RCA. No intervention was taken. The patient admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for
futher manegment.

** On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools. He
reports rectal bleeding suggestive of hemmeroidal origin, and
has been by GI and the OSH. He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac catheterization:
1- Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant
systemdemonstrated severe diffuse three vessel disease. The LMCA
had a
30-40% ostial taper. The LAD was a diffusely diseased and
calcific
vessel with 80% haxy mid segment stenosis. The LCX had a 60%
proximal
disease. The RI was a large vessel with serial stenosis
including 90%
proximal and 80% mid-vessel lesions. The RCA had a 70% ostial
stenosis.
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed normal
systemic
arterial pressure (114/62 mmHg).
3- Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Consult cardiac surgery (Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] notified)

Carotid u/s: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid
stenosis.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Study limited by nonadministration of intravenous contrast.
Concentric
narrowing of the short segment of the distal descending colon,
which may be
due to underdistension, however, mass lesion cannot be excluded
and further
evaluation with colonoscopy is recommended.
2. Diverticulosis, no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

TTE:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal
hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, status post POBA 10
years prior.  A recent outpatient persantine MIBI revealed
inferior and lateral wall ischemia.  With a presentation of
acute onset chest pain concerning for ACS, the patinet was ruled
out for MI and had non-specific EKG changes.   With the recent
abnormal stress test, he underwent cardiac catheterization,
which revealed three vessel disease.  He had been started on
heparin at the OSH and had been given plavix, but not loaded.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for likely bypass, and
pre-op evaluation was performed, including carotid u/s, chest
XR, and vein mapping.  While on heparing, the patinet was noted
to have BRBPR (work up discuss below.)  Surgery was deffered in
the acute setting, with plan to further addess as an outpaitn.
He was continued to 81mg of ASA, high dose atorvastatin, and
metoprolol.
.
#. Congestive Heart Failure: Again, complaints of chest pain
consistent with unstable angina, and no evidence of cardiac
damage.  A TTE was optained, which showed  2+ MR/ 1+ AR / EF >
55%/ concentric LV hypertrophy.  He was euvolemic on exam.  His
metoprolol dose was uptitrated.  There were no formal
indications for ACEi, and was not started.
.
#. Rhythm:  On presenation, patinet showed his known AF with
normal ventricular response.  While on a heparing Gtt, had
BRPB
