Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for possible cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left heart catheterization with selective coronary angiography.
Ablation.


History of Present Illness:
60M with CAD s/p Omnilink bare metal stent to mid-RCA [**2-6**], EF
32%. Presented this afternoon to [**Hospital6 19155**] after
two episodes CP overnight (3:30am, 5am). Took 1 SL NTG for each
with resolution of his symptoms, and went to the ER. In the ER,
VSS: T 98.0F, BP 125/85 HR 77, RR 20, SaO2 97% RA. He was given
lopressor 2.5mg IV. Initial OSH labs were significant for CK
312(4), trop 0.01. Hct 52.4, plt 319, INR 1.3 (on coumadin), K
3.9, gluc 106. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
possible cardiac catheterization.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he stated that he has not had additional
episodes of chest pain since this am. He usually has episodes
about every 2 weeks but the episodes have been more frequent
over the past week and has had three other episodes this past
week. His chest pain awoke him from sleep at 3:30 and then 5:00
this am and he described the pain as radiating across his chest.
He also had "the sweats" at the time and felt dizzy. Each
episode lasted 10 minutes and was relieved by NTG.
.
Note: Approx. 1 hour after arriving to the floor, he began to
flip in and out of VT. His blood pressure was stable throughout
the episode and he appeared to flip out with valsalva but
immediately went back in. The episodes lasted 30 seconds to 1
mins. Amio bolus and drip was started and the runs of VT stopped
but he continued to have ectopy. He was asymptomatic throughout,
although scared.
.
ROS: No PND, +/- orthopnea (doesn't like to sleep flat) but
hasn't increased the number of pillows. No f/c/n/v. No abd
pain/const/diarrhea. No dysuria. No cold sx.


Past Medical History:
CAD: s/p MI
CHF: EF 32% on [**2-6**] cath
AF s/p CV [**6-8**]. [**12-20**] INR 1.9, coumadin switched to 4mg MWF, 5mg
other nights.
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
OSA (he denies, no snoring)
BPH s/p prostate resection
h/o LE superficial thrombophlebitis
.
PSurgH:
Prostate resection
Double Hernia repair


Social History:
Currently smokes 2.5 ppd X 24 yrs. Denies EtOH or illicit drug
use. Lives with wife and brother-in-law. Now retired but last
worked at the [**Holiday **] Tree Shop. Lives a sedentary lifestyle.

Family History:

Pertinent Results:
[**2112-12-29**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation. Left anterior fascicular
block. Poor R wave progression could be due to left anterior
fascicular block but also consider old anterior wall myocardial
infarction. T wave inversions in leads V4-V6 suggest myocardial
ischemia.
.
[**2112-12-30**] CATH: COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, minimal disease in the LAD and LCX vessels and
widely
patent RCA stent with 30% lesion distal to the stent.
2. Left ventriculography showed a moderatedly depressed ejection

fraction of 37% with global hypokinesis.
3. Limited hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic aortic
pressure
and LVEDP.
.
[**2112-12-31**] TTE: IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with EF 30-35% and moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal, anterior, and
inferior hypokinesis. Moderate symmetric LVH with mildly dilated
LV cavity. Elevated LV filling pressure. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
[**2113-1-2**] TEE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed. Regional left
ventricular dysfunction is present with basal-to-mid inferior
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No left atrial or left atrial appendage thrombus.
Mild mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior TEE study (images
reviewed) of [**2111-6-10**], trace aortic regurgitation is now seen.
.
[**2113-1-2**] CXR:
An endotracheal tube is positioned 5 cm above the carina.  There
is a new dense air space consolidation involving the left lower
lung zone.  Fullness in bilateral hila is concerning for
underlying adenopathy.  The right lung is clear.  The
surrounding soft tissues are unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Endotracheal tube in good position at the thoracic inlet.
2.  New left lower lung dense airspace consolidation, concerning
for
pneumonia. Follow-up status post treatment to exclude an
underlying mass
lesion.
.
[**2113-1-2**] CXR:
Since [**1-2**], trachea has been extubated.  Lung volumes are
normal.  Lungs are now clear.  Previous opacification in the
left upper lobe is due to atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is
longstanding, probably unchanged since [**2110-11-5**].  No
pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22079**] is a 60 year old male with a history of CAD,
ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 37% 07/05), HTN, afib who presented
with chest pain concerning for unstable angina.  While being
admitted to the floor, he had several episodes of asymptomatic
sustained ventricular tachycardia and was transferred to CCU
care.

#) Cardiac:
RHYTHM:
a) Sustained asymptomatic VT:  Monomorphic VT with an uncertain
etiology but ddx included significant structural heart disease
(eg, coronary heart disease with prior myocardial infarction,
dilated cardiomyopathy, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Patient
describes several episodes of CP with dizziness leading up to
hospitalization, and of note, his lisinopril was recently
discontinued secondary to
