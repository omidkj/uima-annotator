Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Vein Isolation Ablation


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year old woman with PMHx monomorphic VT arrest
while on Flecainide, CAD s/p mid RCA and proximal LAD stenting
in [**2157**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation previously treated with
Sotalol, Flecainide, Amiodarone and dronedarone who comes to the
CCU after becoming hypotensive and 1 pressor dependent after a
PVI.  The patient was previously treated with multiple agents
for her A fib, most recently amiodarone which was d/c'd due to
concern over pulmonary toxicity and dronedarone which was
stopped in advance of the PVI.  She also underwent a TEE/DC
Cardioversion on [**2164-3-26**], however reverted back to atrial
fibrillation within a few weeks of the cardioversion.  The
patient decided to undergo a PVI at that time and presented
today for the procedure.  She was noted to be hypotensive in the
PACU and received a DOSE of neosynephrine which increased her
SBP to 110, however, her heart rate was in the high 40s and 50s.
 She was switched to dopamine which kept her SBP 97-100.  She is
being transferred to the CCU for management of her hypotension.

.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2164-6-29**]):    No MRSA isolated.

ECG: [**6-26**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Modest ST-T wave changes
are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of the same date
the
QTc interval appears shorter but there may be no significant
change

[**6-26**]: Atrial fibrillation. The QTc interval appears prolonged but
it is difficult to
measure. Modest ST-T wave changes. Findings are non-specific.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2164-6-19**]
probably no
significant change

[**6-27**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Delayed R wave
progression with late precordial QRS transition. Modest ST-T
wave changes.
Findings are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2164-6-26**]
no significant
change.

[**6-27**]: Sinus rhythm with a single ventricular premature beat.
There is borderline
prolonged A-V conduction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2164-6-27**] atrial
fibrillation is no longer present

[**6-28**]: Sinus rhythm. Borderline prolongation of the P-R interval.
Poor R wave
progression is likely a normal variant but consider prior
anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2164-6-28**] no
diagnostic interim change

[**6-28**]: Sinus rhythm. Borderline prolonged A-V conduction. Compared
to tracing #1 ventricular premature beat is no longer present

Echo: PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Conclusions
On very limited imaging there is no definite pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad

CXR [**6-28**]: Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2163-2-15**].

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, but there is slight
interval
progression of interstitial opacities, finding that might
represent
interstitial pulmonary edema that has developed. Widening of the
left
mediastinum is present, but this may reflect asymmetric position
of the
patient. Repeated radiograph after diuresis, preferably in PA
and lateral
upright technique is recommended for precise characterization of
the
mediastinum and documentation of resolution of mild pulmonary
edema.
