Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year-old male with
a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2186**] with severe three vessel
disease, congestive heart failure with recent catheterization
showing moderately to severely elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with 90% occlusion of his left anterior
descending coronary artery and subtotally occluded left
circumflex and diffusely diseased left internal mammary
coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery with 90% stenosis at the touch down of the left
anterior descending coronary artery.  The patient also has
hypertension, hypercholesteremia and type 2 diabetes.  He was
transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where he presented with 10
out of 10 chest pain.  The patient reported taking two
nitroglycerins sublingual yesterday without significant
relief of his chest pain.  The patient states he has been
having chest pain since his cardiac catheterization on
[**2194-12-18**], but was particularly worse on the day prior
to admission.  At [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital the patient was
experiencing 10 out of 10 chest pain and received nitropaste
two inches, three sublingual nitroglycerins, morphine 4 mg
intravenously, Lopressor 5 mg intravenously.  The patient's
pain was subsequently decreased to 1 out of 10 after the
sublingual nitroglycerins.  His vital signs remained stable
throughout his stay at the outside hospital.  The patient was
transferred on a nitroglycerin drip and Aggrastat drip as
well as given Lovenox and aspirin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2187-5-21**], status post Q wave
inferior myocardial infarction.  At that time left internal
mammary coronary artery was grafted to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery.  On [**9-/2187**] he had another
catheterization showing occluded grafts with 80% stenosis of
his left internal mammary coronary artery.  In [**2190-4-20**] a
catheterization showed severe three vessel disease with 30%
left main disease, 60% proximal left anterior descending
coronary artery disease, diffusely diseased left anterior
descending coronary artery, proximal right coronary artery
occlusion, atretic left internal mammary coronary artery to
left anterior descending coronary artery and severe left
ventricular dysfunction with an EF of 30%.  On [**2194-12-18**] the patient had another catheterization that showed
again three vessel disease with the left main severely and
diffusely diseased with proximal left anterior descending
coronary artery 90% and proximal left circumflex subtotally
occluded, diffusely diseased left internal mammary coronary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery with 90%
stenosis at touch down site of the left anterior descending
coronary artery.  Increased right sided filling pressures
with LVEDP of 25, wedge of 25 and at that time he had a
failed intervention to his left internal mammary coronary
artery graft.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife and children.
Not currently smoking or drinking.  The patient has a brother
in his 40s with coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile
with a blood pressure of 90/50, heart rate 76, breathing at
18, 90% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient is in no acute
distress.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Anicteric sclera.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  Neck showed no evidence of JVD.
Cardiovascular examination positive S1 and positive S2.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Occasional skipped beats.  Lungs
faint bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen is soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities minimal
lower extremity edema with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Neurological examination awake, alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  The
patient's white blood cell count is 6.7, hematocrit 35,
platelet count 251.  Chem 7 129, sodium 5.3, potassium 97,
chloride 19, bicarb 37, BUN 1.5, creatinine 460, glucose
calcium 8.8, INR 1.6.  CK 111, MB 2.3, MB index 2.1.
Troponin I 2.7, which is elevated.  Electrocardiogram shows
normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute, normal axis,
normal intervals, Q wave inversions in 2, 3 and AVF and in V4
through V6.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, but no evidence
of acute congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient
was taken to the catheterization laboratory on [**2195-1-21**] where
similar findings were noted on his prior catheterization and
had a stent placed in his proximal left anterior descending
coronary artery as well as his left main.  He had failed
intervention for his vein graft to his right coronary artery
and no intervention done to his left internal mammary
coronary artery.  The patient was also noted to have a wedge
pressure of 31.  The patient was sent to the Coronary Care
Unit with an intraaortic balloon pump given his poor cardiac
output and continued chest pain.  In the Coronary Care Unit
he was continued on his Plavix, aspirin, beta-blocker,
statin, ace inhibitor and on heparin drip and Aggrastat drip
status post catheterization.  However, on [**1-22**] his platelet
count was noted to drop from 251 to 5 on [**1-22**] and his
Aggrastat drip and Heparin drip were discontinued.  He was
monitored closely for signs of bleeding and had mild amount
of epistaxis.  See additional information in heme section of
the hospital course. The patient was transferred to the floor
having intermittent chest pain and was transitioned to po
nitrates for his chest pain.  He briefly required
nitroglycerin drip for relief of chest pain in the Coronary
Care Unit and he was transitioned to po nitrates.  He was
slowly titrated off his drip.

The patient was initially placed on long acting nitrate of
Imdur, however, due to hypotension issues was transitioned to
shorter acting Isosorbide dinitrate and titrated up as his
blood pressure tolerated.  When the patient left the hospital
he was chest pain free for greater then 24 hours.  During his
episodes of chest pain in the clubbing, cyanosis or edema and
on the floor he had no ST or T wave changes that were changed
from normal.  It was felt the patient was likely not a
candidate for further intervention given his limited
remaining blood supply to his myocardium.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26194**] was
considering a possible intervention to his left internal
mammary coronary artery graft, however, will hold off on any
plan until the patient more urgently requires intervention
given the complicated nature of the procedure.  In the
interim the patient will be maximally medically treated with
aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker, statin and ace inhibitor.  He
will be given po nitrates for pain relief.

Pump:  The patient was diuresed once he came into the
Intensive Care Unit with intravenous Lasix.  He was
responding to 40 mg intravenously.  His PA diastolic
pressures, which were used as an estimate of his wedge
pressures decreased significantly during his stay in the
Coronary Care Unit and were approximately in the low 20s when
he was transferred to the floor.

Rhythm:  The patient had frequent premature atrial
contractions noted on telemetry and was thought to be in
atrial fibrillation, however, he was mostly in normal sinus
rhythm with frequent premature atrial beats.  His heart rate
was well controlled with beta-blocker.
