Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 43 y/o man with ESRD on HD s/p recent removal of
transplant nephrectomy in [**8-7**], HTN, and hepatitis C who
presents with ongoing abdominal pain, hematuria, and difficulty
breathing. The patient notes ongoing right lower quadrant
abdominal pain at site of nephrectomy (done in [**8-7**]) since
surgery. No real change in pattern or quality of pain. Pain
located directly over site of surgical incision. No diarrhea or
vomiting but nauseated. No increase in pain today. Has also had
hematuria since his nephrectomy last month without change.
Hematoma was visualized at nephrectomy site on CT done [**2161-8-21**].
Also complaining of dysuria with subjective fevers at home with
unclear timeline (states that subjective fevers have occurred
since his prior hospitalization).
.
In addition, patient notes recent orthopnea and increasing
dyspnea at rest. He did not go to dialysis today (usual
T,Th,Sat). Has not missed any doses of medication per his
report. He denies increased salt intake. He endorses chest pain
while "fatigued" but does not further characterize. Reports no
chest pain at rest. No palpitations. Has chronic right lower
extremity edema per his report. No chest pain currently.
.
On arrival to our ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 98.2,
HR 80, BP 152/106, RR 16, 100% on RA. BP in the ED ranged from
160s-170s systolic. He desaturated to 90 and then in to the 80s
with sleeping and was placed on a NRB mask with improvement in
sats to 100%. He received 2 mg IV morphine X 1 for abdominal
pain. CXR demonstrated volume overload; renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] for
possible dialysis tonight. Transplant surgery was also consulted
given his recent nephrectomy.
.
ROS: + subjective fevers at home. No weight changes. No chills.
Denies headache, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, pain with
swallowing. Endorses chest pain while "fatigued" but does not
further characterize. No CP at rest. Dyspnea as above. No
palpitations. Nausea without vomiting. No hematemesis. No
diarrhea or blood in stools. Pain in RLQ at site of prior
nephrectomy. + hematuria as above. Chronic RLE swelling. No
joint pain or rash.
.
Patient was admitted to the MICU.  He had dialysis and his
dyspnea improved some.  Called out of the MICU when he was
satting 100% on RA after dialysis and fluid removal.  Patient
was started on cefpedoxime for trace + UTI.
.
Overnight, his O2 Sat dropped to the high 80's on [**12-31**] L NC.  ABG
was done which showed PO2 at 74.  Increased O2 to 4L NC and O2
sat improved to 95% on RA.  At the same time the patient was
complaining of chest pain.  He said this pain was present at
rest and constant.  He said it was worse with inspiration,
relieved somewhat by nitroglycerin. CE's sent and were at
baseline.  CXR done, showed continued fluid overload.
.
This AM, the patient continued to feel chest pain with
inspiration.  He continues to feel short of breath.  He reports
diaphoresis, but consistent with his subjective fevers.  He said
the pain never really went away overnight even though he was
given nitroglycerin.  Repeated EKG this AM, no change.  Cycling
enzymes.  Patient going to HD early this AM.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: [**2161-9-15**]:  Worsening pulmonary edema and slight interval
increase in size of small bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right.
.
Echo: [**2161-9-16**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).,
most prominent in the septum and anterior walls. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-7-24**],
the LVEF has signficantly declined
.
CXR:  [**2161-9-16**]:  The double-lumen dialysis catheter tip is in the
right atrium. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
Interval increase in bilateral perihilar opacities consistent
with volume overload and current pulmonary edema. Bilateral
pleural effusions are present as well as bibasal atelectasis.
.
Abd US: [**2161-9-16**]:  1. 4.7 x 2.2 x 2.9 cm thick-walled fluid
collection in right lower quadrant has decreased in size from
previous examination from [**2161-8-21**]. 2. Bilateral pleural
effusions.
3. Gallbladder polyps.
.
CXR: [**2161-9-17**]: Persistent but improved mild pulmonary edema.
.
US of AV Fistula:  Patent radiocephalic AV fistula on the right.
There are no focal velocity elevations to suggest stenosis in
the outflow vein. The elevated anastomotic velocities with
turbulence is characteristic and is difficult to correlate with
any level of stenosis. Suggest repeat exam with volumetric flow
analysis to judge suitability of the fistula for dialysis.
.
Cardiac MRI:  Impression:
1. No significant obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Severely dilated left ventricle with mild global hypokinesis
and no
regional wall motion abnormalities. The LVEF was mildly
decreased at 42%. The effective forward LVEF was moderately
decreased at 31%.
3. Moderately dilated right ventricular cavity size with mild
free wall
hypokinesis. The RVEF was mildly depressed at 37%.
4. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation.
5. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was mildly dilated.
6. Moderate biatrial enlargement.
7. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
