HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year old
male who was admitted on [**6-30**] for a syncopal episode while
climbing up to the stairs at his home.  At that time the
patient lost consciousness.  He was found by his daughter who
then called the paramedics.  Upon admission the patient had a
syncopal workup which included a head computerized tomography
scan which was negative, as well as a carotid duplex which
was negative.  The patient had an electrocardiogram done
which showed no ST elevation and nonspecific changes.  He was
then sent for a stress test which had uninterpretable changes
because of his current regimen which included Digoxin.  It
was thought that at that time the patient may have increased
vagal tone which may have lead to the syncopal episode so a
biventricular pacer was then placed.  The patient at that
time was still in atrial fibrillation which he has been in
for some time.  Following his pacer placement, the patient
was doing well but the following morning he was found
unresponsive and pulseless by the house staff.  The patient
was immediately given oxygen and recovered quickly without
cardiopulmonary resuscitation or any other means.  The
patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit.  Upon
admission the patient was found to be afebrile with a
temperature of 98 degrees.  His heartrate ranged between 72
and 83 with atrial fibrillation.  His respirations ranged
from 17 to 26, blood pressure systolic ranged from 103 to
112/51 to 59.  He was sating at 99% on 2 liters of oxygen,
nasal cannula.  His ins and outs at that time for a 20 hour
period were 501 cc in, 1105 cc out for a negative total of
604 cc.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient was calm,
in no apparent distress but was found to have [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
respirations with notable hyperventilation followed by apneic
periods.  Head and neck examination, the patient was
nonicteric, mucosa were moist.  No jugulovenous distension
was noted.  His chest was clear to auscultation, anteriorly
and laterally.  Cardiac examination, he had an irregularly
irregular rhythm with a II/VI murmur, no rubs were noted.
His abdomen had positive bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended.  His extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema with intact 2+ pulses bilaterally.  Neurological
examination, he was alert and oriented times three.  Pupils
were equally round and reactive to light, extraocular
movements intact.  The patient had no nystagmus.  Mild
increase in tone in all four limbs symmetrically with
downgoing toes bilaterally.  His strength and sensation were
grossly intact and symmetrical bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed
the patient had a white count of 6.4, hemoglobin 9.5,
hematocrit of 27.1.  Chem-7 with sodium 143, potassium 4.5,
chloride 108, bicarbonate 23, BUN 31, creatinine 1.7.  His
AST was 24, ALT 20, lactate of 3.7.  The patient had serial
cardiac enzymes with a peak CPK of 487, calcium 9.0,
phosphorus 3.2, magnesium 2.1.  He had a urine culture from
[**6-30**] which was positive for enterococcus over 100,000
units.  The previous head computerized tomography scan was
negative.  Chest x-ray showed a possible small infiltrate.
Stress test, electrocardiogram was uninterpretable because of
Digoxin therapy.  His echocardiogram done on [**7-2**] showed a
dilated left ventricle, decreased left ventricular systolic
function with an ejection fraction of 25% with 1 to 2+ aortic
regurgitation and 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation with some mild pulmonary hypertension, all
findings which were similar to a previous echocardiogram,
[**2161-11-15**].  Carotid duplex showed no abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During the patient's admission to Cardiac
Care Unit, serial cardiac enzymes were drawn at which time he
ruled in for a myocardial infarction with no ST segment
elevation.  The patient was started on a beta blocker,
Aspirin, heparin with an Ace inhibitor which was held
temporarily because of his increase in creatinine which was
thought to be due to his hypotensive episode.  The patient
was then sent the following day for a cardiac catheterization
which revealed no change in his coronary artery disease and
no intervention was done at that time.  The following day,
[**7-6**], the patient was transferred to the floor and was
found to have a creatinine that improved to 1.2.  At that
time an ACE inhibitor was started.  The following day, [**7-7**], the patient did well but had some confusion over night
and was found to have a slight decrease in urine output with
a slight rise in creatinine to 1.4.  The patient had gentle
intravenous hydration.  The case manager was consulted at
that time as well as physical therapy.  The patient's Foley
catheter was discontinued.  The following day [**7-8**], the
patient did well over night with no confusion noted.  The
patient did urinate some dark red urine which was thought to
be related to trauma from his Foley catheter.  It was also
decided at that time that the patient should be cardioverted
for his atrial fibrillation so that his biventricular pacer
could function more efficiently.  It was also decided at that
time that the patient should continue on anticoagulation with
Coumadin after his discharge from the hospital because of the
future risk of atrial fibrillation and history of stroke.
The following day, the patient did well.  He had somewhat
decreased urine output which was red, thought to be secondary
to his Foley catheter which had since been removed.  The
patient had a chest x-ray which showed no signs of congestive
heart failure so he continued with gentle intravenous
hydration.  His creatinine at that time was found to be 1.5.
His blood pressure was stable with systolics to the 160s so
the patient's Lopressor was increased to 50 mg b.i.d. and his
ACE inhibitor was changed to Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.  Because
the patient's INR was 1.5 on his Coumadin dose of 60 mg per
day, the patient was placed on Lovenox temporarily until his
INR became therapeutic between 2 and 3.  The patient was then
discharged to a rehabilitation facility.  At discharge, the
patient's status was good.  The patient was found to have
good mental status, bibasilar crackles with some lower
extremity edema 1+, but the rest of the examination was
unremarkable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Syncope with permanent pacer placement
2.  Acute myocardial infarction
3.  Atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day
2.  Lipitor 10 mg once a day
3.  Amiodarone 400 mg twice a day
4.  Coumadin 6 mg once a day
5.  Metoprolol XL 50 mg twice a day
6.  Lisinopril 5 mg once a day
7.  Docusate 100 mg twice a day
8.  Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneously q. 12 until his INR is
therapeutic

FOLLOW UP:  The patient's follow up plans are to go to a
rehabilitation facility where he will have his INR checked
and continue Coumadin.  The patient will have frequent
creatinine checks with close monitoring of his ins and outs
with gentle intravenous hydration.  The patient will also
continue on his Amiodarone where he will follow up with
pulmonary function tests, liver function tests and thyroid
function tests to monitor toxicities.  The patient after
rehabilitation will have follow up appointments with Device
Clinic for his pacemaker, have a cardiology follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He will follow up with his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 30867**] for an appointment in
approximately two to three weeks.  The patient will also
follow up with INR checks either at home or at [**Hospital 263**] Clinic.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred to [**Hospital3 7511**] for rehabilitation.
