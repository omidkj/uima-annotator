Admission Date:  [**2170-3-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2170-3-16**]


Service:  CARDIAC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is an 82-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
inferior [**Doctor First Name **] myocardial infarction.  Prior catheterizations
demonstrated 30% left main coronary artery stenosis, 50% left
anterior descending stenosis and occlusion of the PVA arising
in the left circumflex coronary artery.  The right coronary
artery is nondominant.  He has been maintained on medical
therapy.  On [**3-6**], at home, the patient had a syncopal
episode.  He was taken by the ambulance to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
There, the patient had a ventricular fibrillation arrest
which responded to 200 joules of defibrillation shock.  The
patient reverted to atrial fibrillation.  He was placed
initially on lidocaine and then intravenous amiodarone and
reverted to sinus rhythm.  His CKs and troponin at that time
were negative and his electrocardiogram was negative.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital6 2910**] for further
management.  He underwent cardiac catheterization there.
Please see full report for full details.

Briefly, the cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 1322**] showed left main 30%, left anterior descending
proximal 90%, left circumflex a distal 90%, nondominant right
coronary artery with MCI.  His cardiac output at that time
was 3.4.  His cardiac index was 2.2.  His ejection fraction
was 50%.  He had inferior wall basal hypokinesis.
Echocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 2910**] briefly
showed normal left ventricular size with regional wall motion
abnormality but overall preserved left ventricular systolic
function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild
aortic stenosis, mitral annular calcification, mild 1+ mitral
regurgitation, mild 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2545**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery at [**Hospital6 649**] was contact[**Name (NI) **].  Arrangements were made for the
patient to be transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for urgent coronary artery bypass surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 4.7 mm abdominal
aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease.  The patient
underwent coronary angiography in [**2164-1-5**] which
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  At that
time, there was 50% proximal left anterior descending
stenosis.  There was 80-90% of both coronary artery stents.
The left circumflex artery was dominant.  The right coronary
artery was nondominant vessel and demonstrated 70% proximal
stenosis.  A left ventriculogram was noted.  The patient
subsequently underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty with stenting of the left circumflex coronary
artery at that time.  Also in his past medical history, the
patient had a right bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty in [**2168-1-5**].  A cholecystectomy in [**2169-9-4**].  A right carotid
endarterectomy.  He has a history of hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension and there is a question of a history of atrial
fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient was taking aspirin and Lipitor, as
well as Atrovent and albuterol inhalers at home.  The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] on
amiodarone, Aggrastat, heparin and nitrodrip.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a
retired bakery salesman.  He no longer smokes tobacco, but
has a remote history of tobacco use.  He rarely drinks
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's physical exam on
admission revealed vital signs afebrile.  Heart rate 76 in
normal sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure 129/52.  Respiratory
rate 16.  Oxygen saturation was 98% on five liters of oxygen
via nasal cannula.  He was in no acute distress on admission.
His pupils were equal and reactive to light and
accommodation.  No jugular venous distention.  Cardiac:  He
was in a regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  His lungs were clear to auscultation.  His abdomen
was softly distended, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  He
had arterial and venous sheaths in at the time with a
positive hematoma of the right groin.  His pulses were intact
with no edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.9,
hematocrit 28.5%, platelets 442,000.  Sodium 139, potassium
4.0, chloride 106, C02 22, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, glucose
123.  PT 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 150.  AST 17, ALT 11, ALK 76,
total bilirubin 0.5, albumin 3.7, calcium 8.4, magnesium 1.6,
phosphate 4.5.  CK 133, MB 0.8.  Arterial blood gas 7.39, 34,
65, 21, 94%.

His chest x-ray on admission showed mild congestive heart
failure for which he Lasix.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**3-9**], the patient was taken to the
Operating Room and he underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times one off pump.  Left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending.  Patient reportedly had no
complications from his surgery.  He was admitted to CSRU on
propofol postoperatively as well as Neo-Synephrine.  Dopamine
was started for chronotropic support.  His heart rate at that
time was in the 40s sinus bradycardia.  He remained on
dopamine at 2 mg/kg/minute and then later on that day, the
dopamine was weaned off and nitroglycerin was started for
hypertension systolic blood pressure of 150-160s.  The
patient remained intubated.  He had an arterial line, a
Swan-Ganz catheter, two mediastinal chest tubes and one
pleural chest tube in place.

The patient continued to do well postoperatively and on
postoperative day one, the patient was extubated without
incident.  Also on postoperative day one, the patient was
noted to have erythematous swollen area on his left
antecubital intravenous site.  The intravenous was
discontinued and the patient was subsequently started on
Ancef for left arm cellulitis.  The patient continued to do
well and on postoperative day two, the patient was weaned off
all of his drips and he was transferred to the Step Down
Unit, [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6.

Once transferred to the floor, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course until postoperative day five, where he
had a short verse of atrial fibrillation with a heart rate to
the 150s.  He at that time was re-bolused with amiodarone 150
mg and was started on po amiodarone.  Shortly thereafter, the
patient's rhythm went back into normal sinus rhythm and has
had no further bursts of atrial fibrillation.  He remains in
normal sinus rhythm.  Since his admission to the hospital,
the patient had been followed by the EP Service for his
preadmission ventricular fibrillation arrest.  Post coronary
artery bypass graft, EP study was noninducible and there were
no complications.  Since being transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 on a
daily basis, the patient has been seen by Physical Therapy.
His activity level has increased with the assistance of
Physical Therapy and the nursing staff.

On postoperative day six, the patient ambulated at a level of
[**2-5**] using his cane which he uses at home.  His vital signs
were stable with activity.  On postoperative day seven, the
patient was discharged from the hospital to home with
Physical Therapy Services.

Physical examination at time of discharge were vital signs:
Temperature 98.9 with a heart rate of 66 normal sinus rhythm.
Respiratory rate of 18.  Blood pressure 123/66.  O2
saturation 98% on three liters.  His weight at the time of
discharge was 67.3 kg.  His preoperative weight was 66 kg.
He was alert and oriented times three.  Respiratory:  He had
diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  He had 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
Pedal pulses were palpable.  Left arm cellulitis has
resolved.  No redness or edema on the left arm.  His sternal
wound incision is dry and intact with Steri strips, no click,
no drainage, no redness.

Laboratory data at the time of discharge is as follows:
Hematocrit 33.2%, sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 104,
CO2 24, BUN 33, creatinine 1.6, glucose 103, calcium 8.7,
