Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22990**]
Chief Complaint:
xfer from [**Location (un) **], ? new afib

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion
Dobbhoff feeding tube placement


History of Present Illness:
78yo M, dizziness with PMH of IDDM, afib not on coumadin (GIB,
frequent falls), bradycardia s/p pacer, diastolic CHF with EF
55%, chronic microvascular infarcts who presented to an OSH
after falling at home. He reports to me that his legs felt weak
and then he lost consciousness. He denied lightheadedness, chesp
pain, palpitations, loss of bowel/bladder, though per OSH notes,
he reportedly had dizziness and one second of chest pain before
falling. He endorses orthopnea, chronic SOB, denies PND. Per
OSH, he was down for roughly one hour. In the OSH, he had a
negative head CT, EKGs showed anterolateral ST-TW changes, and
he had a CPK of over 1200 with MB 18.4 and TropI of 0.8. An ECHO
showed EF 40-45%. He was started on heparin at some point during
his stay. On [**3-25**], complained of L shoulder pain without N/V,
F/C, SOB, chest discomfort. PE showed large bruise on left
lateral chest wall. Heparin was discontinued. CT scan showed
chest hematoma and lymphnodes suspicious for malignancy. On
[**3-25**], his HCT was 31.7, down from 44 on admission. He was noted
to have an decrease in EF compared to previous ECHOs, so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cath. On the floor he denies
chest pain, lightheadedness, but endorses shortness of breath.

Has chest wall hematoma.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2119-3-27**] 5:37 PM
FINDINGS: Several axial slices are degraded by motion artifact,
some of which were subsequently repeated. A metallic density is
noted adjacent to the left orbit creating streak artifact
limiting evaluation in this region. There is no evidence of
acute hemorrhage or mass effect. There is no hydrocephalus. The
major intracranial cisterns are preserved.
There is near complete opacification of the right maxillary
sinus with a focus of high-attenuation material within, possibly
representing calcification or fungal chronic infection. This
region opacification appears to distort the superomedial
maxillary sinus wall with extension into the adjacent ethmoid
sinuses. A small amount of opacification is detected in the left
maxillary sinus. The right mastoid air cells are completely
opacified while the left are clear. There is complete
opacification of the right frontal sinus.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Opacification of multiple right-sided sinuses. Given the
unilateral aspect of this process, this may represent a
congenital process. Recommend correlation with clinical history
and outside hospital radiographs if available. A CT or MRI of
the paranasal sinuses with contrast may be obtained for further
evaluation if indicated.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2119-3-27**] at 8:31:04 AM      FINAL

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2118-9-21**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade III/IV (severe) LV
diastolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate
([**1-11**]+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated LA pressure.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views. Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Suboptimal image quality -poor suprasternal views. The rhythm
appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due
