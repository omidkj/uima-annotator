CTA
1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
2. Mediastinal lipomatosis.
3. Multinodular and heterogeneous thyroid gland with
calcifications. Correlate clinically, with physical exam and
biochemical profile, and if necessary, thyroid ultrasound.
4. No definite evidence of interstitial lung disease. Dedicated
high- resolution CT of the chest would be more suitable for
assessing for subtle interstitial changes.
5. Cardiomegaly, with leftward mediastinal deviation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25922**] is a 58 yo woman with ESRD on HD, CHF, Afib, DM,
obesity, and vertebral fractures, who presented with clotted AVG
and DOE, was transferred to the MICU for further respiratory
distress in the setting of narcotics, successfully reversed and
diuresed and called out to the floor at her baseline O2
requirement. The following issues were investigated during this
admission:
.
1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Acidosis: While on the floor,the patient
received narcotics for pain control and subsequently went into
respiratory distress which largely responded to Narcan in the
ICU. She was treated with Zosyn/vanc for 5 days for possible
aspiration along with hypotension on original presentation to
the ICU (requiring levophed for less than 24 hours). Her
respiratory distress however, did not completely resolve and
subsequent ABGs performed in the ICU suggested that her baseline
is likely acidemia with pH of 7.2. CXRs were negative for
evidence of parenchymal lung disease (an initial concern given
her amiodarone use) and w/u for PE was negative. It was
concluded that her respiratory acidosis likely represented a
combination of restrictive picture secondary to her obesity, CHF
and possible COPD. Additionally, her respiratory decline began
approximately 2 weeks prior to admission when her Digoxin was
stopped, so this was restarted. The patient was transferred back
to the general medicine floor at her baseline oxygen requirement
with no complications. She continued to have oxygen saturations
in the high 90s on 2L with no complaints of dyspnea.
.
2. AVG Thrombus: Because the patient went into respiratory
distress, she was not able to have the thrombectomy performed
initially. She continued HD through a groin catheter. She
eventually had a tunneled R IJ [**Last Name (un) **] placed where she continued
to have HD done. After arriving to the floor, an attempt was
made to perform a thrombectomy, but this failed and the patient
continued HD daily with the tunneled catheter.
.
3. T11-12 vertebral fractures: Case was discussed with
orthopedics and pt. was determined to not be a surgical
candidate. She was maintained on calcium, vitamin D and
calcitonin, with Tylenol for pain.
.
4. CHF: Patient was maintained on Spironolactone and
Ace-inhibitor and Carvedilol. Digoxin was restarted as stated
above.
.
5. Afib: Pt. was maintained on Amiodarone for rhythm control and
Coumadin for anticoagulation, held only briefly in the
perioperative period for the thrombectomy.
.
6. RA: Pt. was treated with a Prednisone taper and Leflunomide.

.
7. Skin breakdown: Pt. had various areas of skin breakdown
around pannus and coccyx. For which wound care and plastic
surgery were consulted. Wound care recommendations as have been
provided in the discharge paperwork, were followed.
.
8. NIDDM - Pt. was maintained on an insulin sliding scale and
NPH with good control.
.
9  GERD - Pt. was maintained on a PPI
