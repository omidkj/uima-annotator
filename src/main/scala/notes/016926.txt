Chief Complaint:
SOB, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Intubation
Bronchial Blockade placement and removal
Central Line placement

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and pulm
hypertension presents with hypoxia and pleuritic chest pain. Pt
first developed cough with sputum production 2 weeks prior to
admission. She was treated with Azithromycin for 5 days and had
some initial improvement in symptoms. However, after completing
the course, she began to have worsening cough, DOE and
developped a pleuritic chest pain. The chest pain began on her
left side while lying down 3 nights ago. She denies CP with
exertion, symptoms seem to come on when lying down. She denies
any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or [**Month (only) **] po intake.
She has significant DOE and some increase in ankle edema.
Orthopnea is at baseline of 3 pillows and denies PND. She was
being seen in clinic on thursday morning and was sent to ED for
O2 sats in the 80s and tachypnea.
.
VS on arrival to ED: 96.6 72 128/62 18 87 %on RA. Pt underwent
CTA that was negative for PE but showed small to moderate right
sided pleural effusion and R basilar atelectasis. EKGs were
essentially unchanged from prior with non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Pt received Lasix 40mg IV, Aspirin 325mg, Levofloxacin
750mg and combivent nebs. on arrival to floor, pt was feeling
comfortable at rest but reports DOE with minimal exertion.
.
ROS on admission: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

On the floor, a right sided diagnostic and therapeutic
thoracentesis was done. Within minutes, she became hypoxic and
had hemoptysis. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout,
however a code blue was called for emergent intubation. She was
transferred to the MICU for intubation and bronchoscopy, with
possible endobronchial blockade.

Pertinent Results:

compressive
right lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Apparent skin thickening over the right breast. Please

clinical exam.

[**2108-1-10**]: TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-11-16**],
findings are similar.

The current study demonstrates newly developed opacification of
the right
lower lung with a relatively straight upper margin, findings
that are
suspicious for atelectasis of the right middle and right lower
lobe with still
present pleural effusion. The left pleural effusion is
unchanged, but the
aeration of the left lower lung has improved. The upper lungs
are
unremarkable. No evidence of pneumothorax is present.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate
pulm hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia
and DOE transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following
thoracentesis.

1. Hemoptysis: Patient was intubated on arrival to the MICU for
airway protection and ease of bronchoscopy with central line and
arterial line placed.  Bronchoscopy showed RLL bleeding, however
not brisk and bronchial blockade placed to tamponade bleeding.
She was fluid rescusciated and on levophed as needed to maintain
blood pressure.  Bleeding stopped with stable hematocrit and the
blockade was removed.  Prior to extubation on [**2108-1-12**] a short
course of methylprednisolone was given for concern of laryngeal
edema that did not develop post extubation. Hematocrit was
stable for the rest of the hospitalization, and there was no
further evidence of hemoptysis.

2. Hypoxia/DOE: The patient remained hypoxic through her
admission to the MICU secondary to volume overload. She
tolerated diureses with Lasix drip and bolus well and was
transferred to the floor on 5L NC. She was diuresed on the floor
with IV lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **]. On discharge she had
