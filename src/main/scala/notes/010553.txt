History of Present Illness:
81 year old woman with minimal medical
history presented to her primary care provider's office several
months ago with what sounds like congestive heart failure. She
describes that she was very short of breath and having
difficulty
lying down due to "congestion". She was started on Digoxin,
Atenolol and Lasix and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17285**] where she
underwent an echocardiogram which revealed severe mitral
regurgitation. She is now being referred for cardiac
catheterization and surgical consultation. In terms of symptoms,
although she reports an improvement in her symptoms, she
continues to have dyspnea with as little as walking room to room
and an inability to climb stairs due to shortness of breath. She
reports sleeping with her head elevated on the couch and often
waking feeling short of breath. She is now being referred to
cardiac surgery for evaluation of a mitral valve
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-6-8**], Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2) with planimetry
and the continuity equation.The peak gradient across the aortic
valve is 20 mmhg,This could be a severe underestimation given
the severe mitral regurgitation.Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. There is a Mitral P1 flail segment Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass
The patient is now s/p Mitral valve repair with a 28 ring
annuloplasty and CABG
The patient is on a Norepinephrine drip at 0.1 mcg/kg/min ,the
cardiac index is 1.4 ,BP- 96/54
There is transvalvular ,[**12-14**]+ Mitral regurgitation seen
The aortic valve area is 1.2 cm2,with the peak gradient of 20 mm
hg
Ejection fraction is preserved at>55%
Aorta seems intact post decannulation with no visible dissection

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2105-6-8**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 1 and Mitral Valve repair with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].   Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  She remained on vasopressor support for
3 days in the ICU.  Drips were weaned and the patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  The
patient initially had a junctional rhythm and beta blocker was
witheld until recovery.  She developed a thrombocytopenia, HIT
screen was sent and would return negative.  Platelets would
return to normal prior to discharge.  Following extubation, she
displayed signs of aspiration.  The speech and swallow service
was consulted, and recommendations were followed regarding diet
modifications.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  She developed atrial fibrillation and
converted to a junctional rhythm with Amiodarone, and eventually
Sinus Rhythm. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 8 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged home in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
