History of Present Illness:
78 F with CHF, HTN, DM admitted [**2193-9-7**] after 3 episodes of
vomiting in AM, Ruled out x 3. On day 3 of admission ([**2193-9-9**]),
the patient triggered at 4:30 am for right-sided twitching in
the bed. The patient was found on her stomach with her legs
dangling over the side of the bed and her whole right -side
twitching which self-resolved in <5 minutes (prior to arrival of
nightfloat). At that time the patient's oxygen level was 78% on
2LNC. The patient was placed on 6LNC with sats recovering to
100%.
.
Earlier in the same day(9:40AM), the patient developed a new
oxygen requirement 80% on RA, and 97% on 2LNC. Then at 7pm the
patient who was previously AOx3 had become AOx1. At the same
time the patient was noted to have an increasing distended
abdomen and was felt to have SBO. The patient was signed out as
AMS, negative UA, to night float. Nightfloat repeated abdominal
x-ray which showed gas throughout and the patient was noted to
be passing gas. At the time of the twitching event, on exam by
the night float intern, the patient was found to be alert and
oriented to self, but not location or date. The patient was able
to follow commands to move all 4 extremities, take deep breaths,
and open her eyes. Her pupils were equal, round and reactive to
light. She was taken for a stat head CT to rule out intracranial
process, it was prelim negative. Her ABG was 7.18/104/121,
Lactate 0.5. She was transferred to the MICU for further care.
.
While in the MICU, the patient was found to be in hypercarbic
respiratory failure on serial ABGs. BIPAP was initiated and the
patient tolerated this well. Pulmonary/Sleep consult was
initiatied, and the patient is to undergo study while in
hospital with formal study once discharged

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y.o. F with CHF, HTN, DM transeferred back to MED/[**Doctor First Name 147**] from
MICU on [**9-11**] s/p hypercapnic respiratory failure and altered
mental status.
.
#Delta MS/hypercapnic respiratory failure: Likely due to severe
obesity hypoventilation syndrome coupled with sleep apnea. Her
baseline pCO2 appears to be ~60-70. The addition of nasal
cannula oxygen on the floor likely decreased her hypoxic drive
leading to hypoventilation and hypercapnic failure.
Autotitration was performed in the ICU recommending CPAP 7 at
night. The patient's bicarb remained at 40 for 3 days but
trended down to 37 prior to discharge. The patient's lasix was
held throughout her admission and she was discharged on HCTZ.
The patient was discharged home on BiPAP.
.
# Abdominal distension: The patient had normoactive bowel sounds
throughout admission. The distension is thought to be likely due
to gastroparesis. Upon initiation of aggressive bowel regimen,
the patient moved her bowel regularly while admitted. The
patient was discharged home on a bowel regimen.
.
#HTN: The patient's blood pressure was poorly controlled on
atenolol. Nifedipine was added [**9-11**] and the patient was
discharged on 60mg daily.
.
#DM: The patient's blood glucose was covered with 1/2  of her
home dose NPH. She was also covered with a sliding scale insulin
while in house.
.
