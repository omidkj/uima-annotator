Imaging:
[**2-22**] ERCP: Successful biliary cannulation.   A severe diffuse
dilation was seen at the middle third of the common bile duct
and upper third of the common bile duct with the CBD measuring
18 mm in maximal diameter. There was also moderate dilation of
the intrahepatic ducts as well.  A single stricture that was 20
mm long was seen at the middle third of the common bile duct.
Successful placement of a 6cm by 10FR fully covered metal
Wallflex biliary stent (REF 7[**Numeric Identifier 84630**]) was placed
successfully in the main duct.  Otherwise normal ercp to third
part of the duodenum.

[**2-22**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**2133-10-30**], there is large
area of
opacification with apparent cavitation in the left mid zone.
This is
consistent with cavitary process for which TB must be also
considered. An
area of patchy opacification at the right and left bases also
are seen,
raising the possibility of multifocal infection. Central
catheter extends to mid portion of the SVC. Esophageal stent is
in place.

[**2-23**]: In comparison with study of [**2-22**], the cavitary lesion in
the left
upper zone is again seen. The multiple nodules seen on CT are
difficult to
appreciate. There are some patchy areas in the right lung that
could also
represent foci of infection.

[**2-24**] Chest CT: There are multiple pulmonary arterial filling
defects, which appear acute. These include filling defects to
the right middle lobe (2:28), right lower lobe (2:39), right
upper lobe (2:27), lingula (2:33), left lower lobe (2:35) and
possibly the left upper lobe (2:17). However, no definite
pulmonary infarcts are identified and no evidence for right
heart strain is present. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
present.
In the left upper lobe is a thin-walled space, 4.1 x 3.8 cm,
containing no
fluid or debris, surrounded by a 9 x 6.5 cm region of
consolidation.  Additional areas of consolidation or developing
abscesses are present in the right middle lobe (2:32) and right
lower lobe (2:41, 42). In the right upper lobe is a probable
bronchocele (2:24) adjacent to an area of consolidation (2:30).
Mild apical emphysema is present. Millimeter sized pulmonary
nodules described on the prior examination are less evident on
this study, probably subsumed in consolidations. Debris in the
right main stem bronchus (2:25), documents aspiration. A long
mid esophageal stent which contains fluid and debris, new since
the prior study. A stent previously spanning the
gastroesophageal junction is now in the stomach. The GE junction
mucosa is markedly thickened, similar to prior study. The aorta
and SVC are of normal caliber. Left paratracheal lymph nodes
measuring up to 11 mm. Soft tissue, difficult to evaluate is
present along
the inferior anterior mediastinum adjacent to the pericardium
(2:51), could be infiltrating tumor. The heart appears normal.
Although, this study is not tailored for evaluation of the
subdiaphragmatic region. There is heterogeneous attenuation of
the liver, suggestive of diffuse metastatic disease. A metallic
stent is seen within the region of the
CBD, better evaluated and visualized on the recent ERCP. The mid
stent
appears narrowed and possibly kinked, but this appearance is
similar to that seen on the ERCP. A Wallstent is seen within the
stomach. Ascites is
present. There is probable soft tissue surrounding the celiac
axis (2:60),
but evaluation is limited on this early arterial study. BONE
WINDOWS: No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions are present.
IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient has
reported history of pulmonary
emboli, but no prior imaging available at [**Hospital1 18**] to permit
assessment of the progression. No evidence for heart strain, or
pulmonary infarct.
2. Multifocal consolidation and developing abscesses including a
probable
pneumatocele in the left upper lobe, are probably due to
aspiration. These
findings suggest a multifocal infection, which could bacterial
or tuberculous, although no signs of prior tuberculosis are
present. The
