CXR [**1-18**]: Since examination of [**2173-11-29**], there has been interval
improvement in moderate pulmonary interstitial edema, though
mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists, as manifested by
prominence of the interstitial markings and redistribution of
the pulmonary vasculature. Trace left pleural effusion.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  [**11-29**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2172-8-14**], no major change is evident.
.
CARDIAC CATH:  [**6-26**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel CAD. The LMCA was calcified but without
significant disease. The LAD ahd diffuse disease, especially in
teh mid segment up to 70%. The LCX had mild diffuse disease. The
RCA had a 90% hazy lesion in the mid vessel which was diffusely
diseased and
calcified. The distal vessel had 50-60% ISR.
2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated minimally elevated left
sided
filling pressures with LVEDP=13 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful placement of two overlapping Vision bare metal
stents in proximal RCA with considerable difficulty and effort
(3.0 x 12 mm
distally and 3.0 x 8 mm proximally). Final angiography
demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel CAD.
2. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful placement of two bare metal stents in proximal
RCA.

TTE [**2174-1-19**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. At least mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-11-23**],
mitral regurgitation is now more prominent, the right ventricle
is now larger and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is now higher.

CXR [**2174-1-18**]
FINDINGS: Since examination of [**2173-11-29**], there has been interval
improvement in moderate pulmonary interstitial edema, though
mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists, as manifested by
prominence of the interstitial markings and redistribution of
the pulmonary vasculature. Trace left pleural effusion. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Stable appearance of cardiomediastinal
silhouette demonstrates moderate cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic
calcification and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Multilevel
degenerative change of
