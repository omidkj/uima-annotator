Pertinent Results:
[**11-24**] MRI Brain with and without contrast: IMPRESSION:
Presurgical planning evaluation for a homogeneously enhancing
mass arising from the planum sphenoidale as detailed above.

[**11-24**] CT head noncontrast: Postoperative changes in the form of
right frontal and temporal craniotomy and pneumocephalus in
bilateral frontal region and right temporal region. Mild
intraventricular hemorrhage in occipital horns of bilateral
lateral ventricles which is likely post operative.

[**11-25**] MRI BRain with and without contrast:
1. Post-surgical changes with right-sided craniotomy and an
extra-axial fluid collection, measuring approximately 1.8 cm
with displacement of the right frontal lobe and shift of the
midline structures towards the left side by 5 mm. Hemorrhagic
components are noted within the fluid collection related to the
recent procedure.
2. Interval resection of the previously noted tumor in the
sellar/suprasellar
regions with minimal enhancement along the dura likely related
to
post-surgical changes. Significant improvement in the previously
noted mass effect on the optic chiasm.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively on [**11-24**] for a right sided
craniotomy for tumor resection. he toelrated the procedure well,
was extubated in the operating room, and was transferred to the
intensive care unit post-operatively for frequent neuro checks
and SBP control less than 140. POstop head CT demonstratd no
hemorrhage.  Postoperatively he was started on dexamethasone 4mg
IV Q6 hours.

On POD 1 [**11-25**] he was transfered to the regular floor.  POstop
MRI was performed that demonstrated good resection of the mass.
He advanced his diet and began to mobilize.  In the evening on
POD1 and on POD2 he was slightly confused and became agitated
requiring temporary restraints and Haldol 1mg IV x1 dose on
[**11-26**].

By [**11-27**] his exam was greatly improved and he no longer required
restraints.  The Dexamethasone was tapered rapidly as it was
felt to cause psychosis.

On [**11-28**], patient remained stable, he was discharged to rehab.
