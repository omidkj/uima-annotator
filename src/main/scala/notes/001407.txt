Pertinent Results:
[**2150-1-1**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
POST-CPB: There is a bioprothetic valve in the aortic position.
The valve appears well-seated with normally mobile leaflets.
There are no paravalvular leaks and no AI. The LV systolic
function remains normal, estimated EF>55%. There is no evidence
of dissection.

Chest X-Ray: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2150-1-4**]
Previous vascular congestion and borderline interstitial edema
have cleared.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal
postoperative appearance. Lateral view shows small bilateral
pleural effusions and mild to moderately severe bibasilar
atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
