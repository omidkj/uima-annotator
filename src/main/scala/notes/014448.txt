.
# Asthma- Continued albuterol MDI
========================
Transitional issues
# UTI's: she has h/o multiple UTI's, and can be expected to have
more in the future. With her multiple drug allergies, she
unfortunately may need to come to the MICU for desensitization
each time. PCP has tried longterm suppressive therapy, which she
has not been tolerant too. Have set her up with appointments
with Allergy and Uro/Gyn, in hopes that a better long term plan
to manage her UTI's can be found.
