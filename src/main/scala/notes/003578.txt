History of Present Illness:
79 year-old right-handed man with a past medical
history significant for alzheimer's disease,
hypercholesterolemia, and hypothyroidism who was found at around
4:30pm this evening to be behaving oddly. Though he has moderate
alzheimer's at baseline he clearly was acting differently. He
was
clearly more agitated. He was found at one point in the bathroom
folding and unfolding towels. He did this with a napkin and a
handkerchief as well. He was much more fidgety than normal. The
patient's wife called her daughter who phoned their Neurologist.
A decision was made to call EMS and have the patient brought to
[**Hospital **] hospital. Blood pressure there was 149/78 There a CT
scan
showed a right frontal hemorrhage. The white blood cell count
was
slightly elevated at 10.8. The patient was transferred here for
neurosurgical intervention.


Past Medical History:
Hypothyroidism
Hypercholesterolemia
Alzheimer's Dementia


Social History:
Lives with wife. [**Name (NI) **] a daughter in neighborhood.
[**Name2 (NI) **] smoking or drugs.  Drinks a glass of red wine every evening.


Functioned minimally with advanced dementia, but was
conversation and pleasant. Needed prompting and cueing for most
ADLs, and needed help with dressing and personal hygiene. When
put in chair with book/newspaper he would read happily. Was able
to join family on small outings.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Eyes closed. Opens to his name if repeated
loudly
and often. Variably following commands. Didn't open and close
right hand to command. Did close his eyes to command. Didn't
open
his eyes to command. Wasn't able to tell where he was. Correctly
identified his wife as "[**Name2 (NI) **]" when I asked him who she was.
He
doesn't move his limbs to command, but he does keep them up.



-Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested. Pupils equal at 1mm and
minimally reactive. Unable to obtain fundoscopic exam. Corneal
reflex intact bilaterally. No facial droop. Patient actively
opposed eye opening. He was able to hear my questions.



-Motor: All four limbs are antigravity. The patient does not
comply with a formal motor test. He can keep both arms up for 10
seconds and both legs up for 5 seconds.



-Sensory: Intact to noxious stimuli in the upper and lower
extremities bilaterally.



-Coordination: Nt tesed.

Pertinent Results:
MRI [**5-5**]
Again demonstrated is a large right frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, measuring approximately 5.5 cm x 5 cm, not
significantly changed in size from three hours prior. This
lesion demonstrates mostly T2 hyperintensity and T1
isointensity, compatible with an acute hemorrhage. There is
associated mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle with mild subfalcine herniation, not significantly
changed.

Additionally, a moderate amount of layering intraventricular
hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles
is stable. Thre is no evidence of hydrocephalus. On
gradient-echo sequences, scattered punctate foci of
susceptibility are seen within the sulci, likely reflecting
blood products from a small amount of associated subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

No definite enhancement is seen within the right frontal region
to suggest a large mass or vascular malformation. However, given
the relatively large size of this, assessment is somewhat
limited. Additionally, there is no evidence of an acute infarct
within any particular vascular territory. No convincing evidence
of amyloid angiopathy is identified. Minimal mucosal thickening
of the ethmoidal sinuses is seen. No abnormal enhancement is
identified after contrast administration.

IMPRESSION:

1. Large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with
associated subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. Overall
size and appearance is largely unchanged from three hours prior.

2. Mild leftward subfalcine herniation and effacement of the
right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and lateral ventricle is not changed.

3. No definite evidence of underlying mass, vascular
malformation, or infarct. No convincing evidence of amyloid
angiopathy. However, due to the large size of this hemorrhage,
assessment is limited for an underlying lesion, and a followup
study after resolution of acute symptoms is recommended to
exclude any underlying mass or vascular malformation.

CT [**5-5**]
Again is noted a large right frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, slightly larger than the study conducted at 3:00
a.m. this morning. There is associated subarachnoid hemorrhage,
comparable to the prior study. Unchanged bilateral
intraventricular extension is again noted. There is extensive
vasogenic edema surrounding the hemorrhage causing mass effect
and effacement of the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral
ventricle. There is a 4.9 mm leftward subfalcine herniation
compared to prior 4.4 mm. There is no uncal or downward
transtentorial herniation. There is diffuse global atrophy,
unchanged. There are no acute major vascular territorial
infarcts or obvious masses. There is no hydrocephalus. No other
interval changes are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval increase in the right frontal
intraparenchymal and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Stable intraventricular hemorrhage and minimal leftward
subfalcine herniation.

CT [**5-6**]
Again is noted a large right frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, slightly larger than the study conducted at 3:00
a.m. this morning. There is associated subarachnoid hemorrhage,
comparable to the prior study. Unchanged bilateral
intraventricular extension is again noted. There is extensive
vasogenic edema surrounding the hemorrhage causing mass effect
and effacement of the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral
ventricle. There is a 4.9 mm leftward subfalcine herniation
compared to prior 4.4 mm. There is no uncal or downward
transtentorial herniation. There is diffuse global atrophy,
unchanged. There are no acute major vascular territorial
infarcts or obvious masses. There is no hydrocephalus. No other
interval changes are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval increase in the right frontal
intraparenchymal and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Stable intraventricular hemorrhage and minimal leftward
subfalcine herniation.

CT [**5-10**]
The large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated
edema, mass effect and effacement of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the lateral ventricle have shown expected evolution from prior
study without any evidence of new hemorrhage or infarct. The
4-mm leftward midline shift is unchanged. The diffuse
subarachnoid blood within the cortical sulci is similar,
although the confluent area in the left parietal lobe is less
apparent. There is slightly less blood within the occipital
horns of lateral ventricles than on prior. The mild
ventriculomegaly and dilated temporal horns is similar to prior.

There is new opacification of the left sphenoid sinus. The
mastoid air cells are normal. There are no fractures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Expected evolution of right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricula
