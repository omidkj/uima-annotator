Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
increased shortness of breath and worsening dysphagia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheostomy, PEG placement, IVC filter placement, peptic ulcer
cauterization

History of Present Illness:
50 yo M Spanish speaking quadraplegic male with h/o ALS related
muscle weakness and worsening respiratory failure s/p multiple
hospital admissions for worsening weakness and FTT who presents
from home w/ continued chronic complaints of weakness,
difficulty eating, and intermittent shortness of breath. He
denies any new complaints in the last 5 months. He has had
intermittent SOB and intermittent O2 requirement at home. He has
had continued problems with eating.  Food gets stuck in his
throat when eating. He also complains of intermittent nausea.
He is wheelchair bound at home. He was last admitted
[**Date range (3) 50217**] for FTT, nausea and decreased po intake. At that
time, neurology recommended hospice care because of frequent
admissions for failure to thrive. It was also recommended that
he have acute rehab placement rather than a discharge home as it
seemed he needed more help at home. However patient refused and
was discharged home with VNS.
.
In ED, was febrile to 101. CXR and U/A were unremarkable. Blood
cultures were drawn. Given total of 3L NS in ED. He states he
has not received any of his medications today. On the floor, he
is comfortable and smiling. He denies and chest pain, abdominal
pain, vomiting, dysuria, changes in his stools, fever, chills.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2187-8-22**]:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. No definite valvular regurgitation seen in
suboptimal views.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
Date: [**2187-8-29**]
Signed by [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], CCC,SLP on [**2187-8-29**]  Affiliation:
[**Hospital1 18**]

EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, and pureed consistency barium were administered. He
refused to try a ground consistency. The exam was performed with
him seated fully upright at 90  w/the Passy-Muir Valve in place
over the trach.  Results follow:

SUMMARY:
Significant worsening of his oral and pharyngeal swallowing
ability s/p trach placement compared with his videoswallow on
[**2187-8-9**].  He is now having penetration with straw sips of thin
and nectar thick liquid and aspiration with straw sips of thin
liquid.  Aspiration is "silent" or without coughing.  He can not
clear the aspirated material with a cued cough. He has residue
in
his valleculae even when he alternates between bites of puree
and
sips of nectar.  He refused to try a ground consistency.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  It is not possible to eliminate the aspiration risk if he
    takes PO's.  However, we can reduce the risk.  Head position
    is critical to adequate airway protection.  He must be
    propped up with his head at 90 to fully protect his airway,
    and the Passy-Muir speaking valve must be in place over the
    trach.  He reported difficulty breathing by with the PMV on

    by the end of our study despite 02 sats of 98%.  His
    respiratory rate was 31 by the end of the exam and it
    dropped back to 24 after removal of the PMV.

2.  The safest way to feed him with the least aspiration risk:
    A.  Sit fully upright w/head propped forward at 90
    B.  Cup sips of nectar thick liquid
    C.  Alternated with bites of pureed foods
    D.  Only when wearing the PMV
    e.  Only after thorough suctioning prior to any PO's

3.  If he is made CMO and he wants water, we would suggest
    Thorough suctioning & complete oral care w/mouthwash first
    then cup sips of ice water only when fullu upright w/PMV on

4.  If he is unable to wear the PMV, we should repeat the
    videoswallow without it to see if he is still safe to take
    PO's without the PMV.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse
and
the medical team.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with
1) respiratory failure, 2) nutritional failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with
1) respiratory failure, 2) nutritional failure.

PROCEDURE:
1.  Tracheostomy.
2.  Gastrostomy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the
operating theater and his neck, chest and abdomen were
prepared with Betadine and draped sterilely. The head was
positioned extended with shoulder roll placed. The
tracheostomy incision was performed first with the remainder
of the field isolated with an over drape.

A vertical midline incision was formed in the neck between
the cricoid and the sternal notch. This was infiltrated with
1% lidocaine with epinephrine for improved hemostasis. The
wound was taken down in the midline using cautery taking care
to remain in the raphae. The anterior surface of the trachea
was crossed at the first interspace by the thyroid isthmus.
The isthmus was therefore isolated and suture ligated
bilaterally with #2-0 silk. It was then divided and the
second and third tracheal rings exposed widely by dissection
of the thyroid off of the trachea. At this time, stay sutures
were placed into the trachea in the midline at the first and
third rings with 3-0 Prolene. A trap door was scored with
cautery and then the trachea was entered sharply with the
endotracheal balloon deflated. The transverse incision at the
second ring was used to visualize the endotracheal tube,
which was then passed distally and further work was done with
airway control above the balloon until we were ready for the
exchange. At this time the remainder of the flap was cut
using [**Hospital1 **] scissors and hemostasis was obtained using cautery
on the tracheal mucosa. At this time, a prelubricated #8
