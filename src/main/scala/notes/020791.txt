         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

   LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: No prior studies. Study is somewhat limited as
it was performed portably and it was difficult to adequately
position this intubated patient. Allowing for this, the right
and left kidneys are normal in appearance allowing for patient
age, with the left kidney measuring 9.5 cm and the right kidney
is somewhat smaller at approximately 8.5 cm, with more cortical
thinning. There is a single simple-appearing cyst involving the
lower pole of the right kidney measuring 1.8 cm. No
hydronephrosis. No perinephric collections. No evidence of focal
hypoperfusion to suggest pyelonephritis, however, correlate
clinically.

IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis nor perinephric abscess.

.
HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is no mass
effect or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles,
cisterns, and sulci are prominent secondary to involutional
change. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are the
sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction and a lacunar
infarct is identified in the right basal ganglia. Extensive
atherosclerotic changes are present in the cavernous carotid
arteries and vertebral arteries. There is partial right ethmoid
sinus opacification. The patient is intubated. The mastoid air
cells are poorly pneumatized.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Involutional changes.

.
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) with
?basal inferior hypokinesis (could not be confirmed). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of mitral regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets and supporting structures are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function with
?basal inferior hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure.  Sputum remarkable for pseudomonas and
enterobacter with left lower lobe infiltrate on subsequent CXR
following hydration consistent with possible pneumonia.  Based
on sensitivities, patient will complete a total of 10 days of
zosyn for treatment.  Midline in place.  She is currently stable
on room air.
.
# VRE UTI:  Urinalysis with wbc too numerous to count and many
bacteria.  Culture grew vanc resistant enterococcus.  Patient
was started on linezolid and will complete a 7 day treatment
course.  Recommend rechecking UA and urine culture upon
completion of antibiotic course.
.
# NSTEMI:  EKG with subtle ST depressions.  Troponin peaked at
0.67 with MBI 23.  Suspect this was due to demand ischemia
(found down with O2 80%).  Complicated by pulmonary edema in the
setting of concurrent volume resuscitation. She diuresed well
and is on a beta blocker, hydralazine, nitrate, statin, and ASA
for medical management.  ECHO with low normal EF with ? basal
inferior hypokinesis, 1+ AR, 2+ MR.
.
# Hypoglycemia. Per notes and discussion with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has
history of hypoglycemic episodes and BS was 40 on EMS
evaluation. Her repaglinide was discontinued given her poor
renal function.  She receiv
