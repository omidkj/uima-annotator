Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2136-8-7**] - Aortic Valve Replacement( 19mm Magna Pericardial Tissue
Valve)

History of Present Illness:
This 78 year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure and hypertension who for
the past 2 years had had progressive symptoms which included
dyspnea on exertion. These symptoms have progressively
increased, especially over the past 2 months. The
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 65 to 70% with
an aortic valve area of 0.51. Coronary catheterization
revealed no evidence of coronary artery disease. Based on
this findings the patient agreed to proceed with surgery. The
risks, benefits and possible alternatives were discussed with
the patient, including but not limited to bleeding,
infection, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,
death, renal and pulmonary insufficiency as well as future
operations for her heart valves and she agreed to proceed. We
specifically discussed the possibility of all these
complications. We also discussed the valve choices and the
patient agreed and would like to have a tissue valve to avoid
the use of Coumadin. All questions were answered prior to
proceeding to the surgery to the patient's satisfaction.

Pertinent Results:
[**2136-8-13**] 04:51AM BLOOD Hct-26.4* Plt Ct-78*
[**2136-8-13**] 04:51AM BLOOD UreaN-31* Creat-0.8 K-3.2*

[**2136-8-12**] CXR:
Again seen is moderately enlarged heart but it is similar in
size compared to the prior study. The mediastinal contour is
also unchanged. Again seen is a right IJ line with tip in the
right atrium and scarring or volume loss at both bases. There
are small bilateral pleural effusions that have increased
compared to the film from three days ago.

[**2136-8-7**] ECHO
Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is being AV paced and is receiving an infusion
of
Phenylephrine
1. A bioprosthesis is well seated in the Aortic position. Trace
wash in jets and trace central AI are noted. A peak gradient of
40-45 mm of Hg was noted and an epicardial scan was also
performed confirming the findings. All 3 leaflets move well.
2. Aorta appears intact
3. Other changes are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted directly to operating room on [**2136-8-7**] for
scheduled aortic valve replacement. At that time she had an AVR
with #19 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna pericardial tissue valve. Her
bypass time was 111 minutes, crossclamp time was 87 minutes. She
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the OR to
ICU on Neosynephrine and Propofol infusions. Please see OR
report for details.
The pt did well in the immediate post-op period, anesthesia was
reversed, sedation was weaned off and she was sucessfully
extubated. On POD1 shw was weaned from her Neo infusion,
remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the step
down floor for continued post-op care.
Once on the floor the patient had an uneventful post-op course,
on POD2 her chest tubes were removed, on POD 5 here epicardial
wires were removed. Her activity level was advanced with the
assistance of nursing and PT.
On POD 6 it was decided the patient was stable and ready to be
discharged to rehabilitation.
