CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting, and hyperglycemia.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 23-year-old
male with long-standing diabetes mellitus type 1, peritoneal
dialysis for end-stage renal disease since [**Month (only) 547**] of this
year, hypertension, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
of 35%, who presented to the Emergency Room with three days
of nausea, vomiting, and hyperglycemia.  The patient was
noted with two to three days of worsening nausea and
vomiting.  The patient denied fevers, chills, or chest pain.

"not working".  The patient states that peritoneal dialysis
has drained net of 2,500 cc out over the last two to three
days.  The patient denied abdominal pain but did note cloudy
peritoneal dialysis fluid.  The patient also had diarrhea
recently that has been worse than his usual.

The patient has been admitted numerous times this year.  The
patient was admitted in [**Month (only) 958**] for diabetic ketoacidosis, in
[**Month (only) 547**] once for congestive heart failure and pneumonia, and a
separate admission for renal failure and initiation of
peritoneal dialysis.  The patient also admitted in [**Month (only) **] of

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] and then later
transferred to the Inpatient Medicine Service on the [**Hospital Ward Name 12053**].

1.  DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS:  The patient is with multiple
episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis this year.  The patient's
increased anion gap, high glucose, ketones also diagnostic of
another episode of diabetic ketoacidosis on admission.  The
patient was monitored in the ICU closely with q. one hour
fingersticks.  The patient was started on an insulin drip
which was eventually tapered according to [**Last Name (un) **] protocol.
The patient was then given D5 normal saline as well as
subcutaneous insulin overlap.  The patient was off of the
insulin drip and requiring only subcutaneous insulin by the
day after admission.  The patient's anion gap closed and
fingerstick glucoses were within normal limits by the second
day of admission.

[**Last Name (un) **] consulted on the patient throughout his hospital stay.
On the medical floor, the patient was restarted on his home
dose of Glargine 20 units q.h.s.  Etiology of the patient's
multiple admissions to the Intensive Care Unit this year for
diabetic ketoacidosis is unclear.  However, the timing of
these admissions seem to correlate with starting of
peritoneal dialysis.  Of note, peritoneal dialysis fluid
contains a large amount of glucose and is likely contributing
to his poor glycemic control.

The Renal Fellow, [**Last Name (un) **] doctors, medical team have been
discussing this issue and the patient has been switched to a
lower glucose peritoneal dialysis fluid as well as receives
insulin in his peritoneal dialysis fluid.  It was recommended
that he check his fingerstick glucose home regularly in
addition to his carbohydrate counting which he does due to
the difficulty in assessing how much glucose is being
absorbed during peritoneal dialysis.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient met the criteria for
peritonitis on admission.  The patient had no signs or
symptoms of peritonitis on the medicine floor but was
continued on cefazolin 500 mg IV b.i.d. while an inpatient.
The patient was maintained on this antibiotic throughout his
inpatient stay but this was discontinued at discharge.

The patient's pneumonia was treated with fluoroquinolones
during his hospital stay.  Blood, urine, and peritoneal
dialysis cultures were nonrevealing.

3.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE:  The patients' peritoneal
dialysis catheter was apparently malfunctioning on admission.
The patient underwent laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis
catheter placement in the Operating Room on [**2155-7-9**].
Beginning on [**2155-7-10**] and [**2155-7-11**], the patient
resumed his peritoneal dialysis cycles at the bedside with
multiple short dialysis cycles, which the patient tolerated
well.  The patient's nephrologist was involved with his care
throughout his hospital stay.  The patient was continued on
his Nephrocaps.  The patient was on the waiting list for a
renal transplant.

4.  ANEMIA:  Hematocrit in the mid 20s.  No signs or symptoms
of acute bleed, Guaiac negative, no history of coronary
artery disease.  The patient was not transfused.  His anemia
was likely related to his end-stage renal disease.  The
patient was on Epogen as an outpatient.

5.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Left ventricular ejection
fraction estimated at 30%, the patient with trace lower
extremity edema.  The patient was continued on Lasix 80 p.o.
b.i.d.  The patient was also restarted on metolazone 2.5 once
he was stable on the medicine floor.  The patient was also
restarted on his labetalol up to his home dose of 600 b.i.d.
on the medicine floor.

6.  PAIN:  Related to the patient's laparoscopic peritoneal
dialysis catheter placement on [**2155-7-9**].  The patient's
pain was controlled with Ultram p.r.n. as well as Tylenol 650
q. six hours.  The patient also received morphine initially
after the procedure.

7.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
maintained on a diabetic, renal, cardiac die
