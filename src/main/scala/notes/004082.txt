Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Pre-syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.Pacemaker placement
2. Surgical evacuation of Hematoma at pacemaker site

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with a past medical history of
atrial fibrillation, Hypertension and has a mechanical aortic
valve which was placed approximately 30 years ago for a "leaky"
aortic valve per patient. The patient is on home Coumadin
therapy for his atrial fibrillation and valve. He presented to
the emergency room complaining of multiple presyncopal episodes.
The patient describes these episodes as sudden occurences of
lightheadedness while sitting at the table. He would then set
his head down on the table and within seconds the symptoms would
resolve. These episodes occur at rest and never happen when the
patient is walking or up and about and more active. He denies
palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and he has no
associated nausea or vomiting. These episodes have occurred [**12-27**]
x in the past week. No related orthopnea, PND, or edema.
.
Pt was recently admitted to the cardiology service for similar
episodes. It was felt that his episodes were due to bradycardia
secondary to severe HTN up to SBP 220s. The patient was started
on lisinopril, amlodipine and HCTZ. Upon discharge, HR ranged in
70s, SBP in 130s. Of note, the patient has been inadvertently
taking [**11-25**] his prescribed dose of amlodipine prescribed over the
past week.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were: Temp 97.1 F, Pulse Rate 48,
BP 180/72 and RR 18, oxygen saturation 100% RA. His HR ranged
from 40-60 in slow atrial fibrillation. On telemetry, he
reportedly had occasional pauses of up to 3-5 seconds, but he
remained asymptomatic during these pauses.
.
On the floor the patient promptly triggered for marked nursing
concern and persistent HR < 40. Patient had multiple [**2-27**] second
pasuses on telemetry with narrow junctional escape beats.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended deferring temporary
pacing wire given elevated INR and history of mechanical valve.
Patient was transferred to CCU for closer observation and
monitoring overnight.  On arrival to CCU patient denied chest
pain, SOB, PND, orthopnea, LE Swelling, syncope or other
complaints.


Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:: Hypertension
2. CARDIAC HISTORY: No interventions in past.
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

pack year smoking history. Quit 30 years ago.


Family History:
non contributory

mechanical click

.
At time of discharge:
Pt's Exam is unchanged except for extensive erythema and edema
of left arm secondary to tracking of blood associated with pace
maker insertion.  He has a palpable, but small hematoma
surrounding his pacer site which is bandaged.

Pertinent Results:
[**2145-8-28**] : EKG: Atrial fibrillation with bradycardia HR 40-50bpm,
left axis, no hypertrophy, mildly peaked T-waves, no acute ST-T
changes
.
TELEMETRY [**2145-8-28**]: Bradycardia with junctional escape, frequent
pauses of [**2-27**] seconds duration
.
[**2145-8-30**] TTE / ECHO : (no priors for comparison) The left atrium
is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The discs appear to move, but the
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis (unless very small prosthesis - details unknown). .
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of
regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic
valve.] The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structures are
thickened. No mitral stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic pressure. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Well seated aortic valve prosthesis with slightly increased
gradient. Increased PCWP. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2145-8-31**] CXR post-pacemaker placement:  Single-chamber pacemaker
lead ending in the right ventricle. The rest of the study is
grossly unchanged compared to the previous scan.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with PMH atrial
fibrillation, HTN, and s/p AVR on coumadin who presented with
pre-syncope, bradycardia and prolonged pauses on telemetry/EKG
and was referred to the EP team at [**Hospital1 18**]. Ultimately, after
evaluation it was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] would benefit from a
pacemaker. He underwent surgery on [**2145-8-31**] and had a local
complication of a left anterior subclavian and anterior shoulder
region small hematoma after his procedure with some additional
ecchymotic tracking down his left arm. He was given a pressure
dressing and warm compresses for comfort after the procedure.
Throughout this time he had a slight dip in his Hct levels from
29-30 range to 25-26 range but was hemodynamically stable and
did not require transfusion.  Discharge delayed by hematoma and
by subtherapeutic INR. Pt has a INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0 given his
atrial fibrillation, advanced age, hypertension, and mechanical
valve.
.
# Rhythm: pt persistently in Atrial fibrillation. Ventricular
rate maintained in the 60-70 range by pacer. Pt not orthostatic
or lightheaded. Will need to maintain INR of 2.5 to 3.0 given
Atrial-fib and valve.  INR will be followed by PCP who followed
INR prior to this admission.
