HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old gentleman
with known mitral regurgitation with complaints of increasing
dyspnea on exertion and lethargy over the last year. Serial
echocardiograms showed worsening mitral regurgitation,
moderate pulmonary hypertension and mildly dilated left
ventricle with an ejection fraction of 45-50 percent. The
patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for operative
management. The patient was admitted prior to surgery for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Mitral regurgitation.
3. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
4. Osteoarthritis.
5. Left leg deformity.
6. Weakness in right arm.
7. Status post appendectomy.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives at home
with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] denies tobacco or ETOH use.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
2. Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. q day.
3. Doxazosin 4 mg p.o. q day.
4. Valsartan 160 mg p.o. q day.
5. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day.


HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2176-5-16**] and was taken to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory. In the laboratory, the
patient was found to have an ejection fraction of 45 percent,
left ventricle end-diastolic pressure of 18, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of seven and pulmonary artery
pressures of 25/8. Coronary angiography showed no obstructive
coronary artery disease. The patient was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2176-5-17**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a
mitral valve replacement with a 29 mm [**Company 1543**] porcine
valve. Please see Operative Note for full details. Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was ninety minutes. Cross-clamp
time was sixty-seven minutes.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition on dobutamine and Levophed infusions. The
patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation
on the first postoperative day. The dobutamine was weaned to
off. The patient had adequate cardiac indices. The patient
continued on Levophed for maintaining adequate perfusion
pressure. The patient's pulmonary artery catheters were
removed on postoperative day one. The patient was started on
Lasix for diuresis. The Levophed was weaned to off by
postoperative day three. The patient was started on low-dose
Lopressor and the patient was transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital.

Postoperatively, the patient was noted to have mild
thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 88. By
postoperative day three, the patient's platelet count had
risen back up to over 100 without any intervention. The
patient's pacing wires were removed on postoperative day
four. The patient began ambulating with physical therapy. The
patient had been started on low-dose Lasix which he was
responding to well. Lasix was converted to p.o. The patient
had persistent tachycardia in spite of being on increasing
doses of Lopressor. The patient was switched to atenolol,
which he was on at home, with good control of his heart rate.
On postoperative day six, the patient had been cleared by
Physical Therapy and was cleared for discharge to home.

rhythm, blood pressure 125/65, respiratory rate 18, room air
oxygen saturation 95 percent.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.9, hematocrit
32.5, platelet count 145, sodium 136, potassium 4.1, chloride
102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 24, creatinine 1.0 and glucose 103.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient's weight on
[**2176-5-23**] is 97.4 kg. Preoperatively, the patient weighed
98.9 kg. NEUROLOGICAL:  Neurologically, the patient is awake,

Strips are intact. There is no erythema or drainage.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well perfused. There is [**1-12**] plus lower
extremity edema.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Mitral regurgitation.
2. Mitral valve replacement.
3. Hypertension.
4. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day.
4. Percocet 5/325 [**1-12**] p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n.
5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. q day times ten days.
6. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q day times ten days.
7. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Doxazosin 4 mg p.o. q h.s.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 55617**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**1-12**] weeks. The patient is to
