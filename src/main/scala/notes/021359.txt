Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the ACS service:

Neurosurgery consulted because head CT showed left
intraventricular hemorrhage. A right ICP bolt monitor was
placed, opening ICP ranged between 14-17 with good wave form.
Serial head CT scans were followed and remained stable. Seizure
prophylaxis was not recommended. His neurologic exam continued
to improve, he was able to open his eyes spontaneously and
follow commands in all 4 extremities in
Spanish. ICP bolt was removed on [**9-6**] with stable ICPs ranging
from [**10-8**]. He underwent CTA which showed decrease in IVH and
evolution of SAH. No further neurosurgical intervention was
required. His mental status continued to improve and he was
eventually transferred to the regular nursing unit where he
continued to progress. He initially required a 1:1 sitter but
this was eventually stopped. He is awake, alert and following
commands with Spanish interpreter.

Renal consulted for [**Last Name (un) **], it was felt that he likely suffered an
episode of decreased CO in setting of tension pneumothorax
consistent with pre-renal-->ATN picture. Patient has had
increased oral intake and low urine osm and normal serum sodium
which is consistent with primary polydipsia and subsequent water
diuresis. Cr leveled  off which was noted to be encouraging for
renal recovery. Urine output was adequate and electrolytes and
MS were within normal. it was felt by Renal that in a healthy
young man such as this there is reason to expect renal recovery.
He is voiding spontaneously and at time of discharge his renal
function trending downward.

He was also evaluated by Plastic surgery for the maxillary
fracture, this was managed non operatively and no further follow
up is being recommended.

Psychiatry was consulted to assess whether the trauma was a
result of a deliberate act of self injury. It was ultimately
determined that this was likely not the case and that he either
fell from a great height secondary to alcohol intoxication.
Inpatient psychiatric treatment not being recommended.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy who worked
with him regularly in rehabilitating him due to his lack of
insurance and inability to get into a rehab facility. At time of
discharge he is ambulating independently, feeding and dressing
himself.

Social work was closely involved with patient's care throughout
his stay providing counseling and emotional support for patient
and his family.

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized after sustaining multiple injuries after
an apparent fall from a great height.

The following information is regarding your brain injury:

In very, very rare cases, serious brain problems can begin after
you go home, even if tests were normal while you were in the
hospital.  If you have any of these, please see your doctor or
go to the emergency room right away. Sudden changes in your
mental status, worsening dizziness, nausea with vomiting are
concerning and should be evaluated immediately.

weeks to months.
