History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 41841**] is a 65 year old male with a history of diastolic CHF
(EF > 60%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2079**] and STEMI [**2102-5-19**] with three
stents placed, ESRD on hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and
known chronic bilateral pleural effusions with associated
trapped lung who presented on [**2102-5-27**] with worsening dyspnea on
exertion.
.
The patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for
approximately one month.  He presented to [**Hospital6 **]
center on [**2102-5-19**] at which times he was diagnosed with a
posterior STEMI and underwent thrombectomy to the PDA, and three
Vision stents to the PDA.  His procedure was complicated by
ventricular fibrillatoni arrest which requierd 2 shocks.  Peak
Troponin I was 21 and CK 657. He was subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for persistent dyspnea on exertion.  He was admitted to
this hospital from [**2102-5-23**] to [**2102-5-25**].  During that admission he
was noted to have persistent large pleural effusions but was not
considered a candidate for pleurex catheter placement given his
need for aspirin and plavix.  Rheumatology evaluation was
negative.  His effusions were felt to be secondary to his
diastolic heart failure and volume overload from chronic
hemodialysis.  He was started on digoxin and underwent scheduled
dialysis and was discharged home.
.
He returned on [**2102-5-27**] with persistent shortness of breath
without recurrent chest pain.  He underwent his regularly
scheduled dialysis on Friday but on returning home could not
climb the steps to his home.  His dyspnea resolved within about
5 minutes but then returned. He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] where he received plavix, cefepime and vancomycin and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Reportedly he
had a low grade fever at [**Hospital3 7362**].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 97.9, BP: 100/64, HR 68, RR
18, O2 96% 2L. Exam was notable for decreased breath sounds at
the bases. Troponin was elevated at 6.23. BNP was elevated at
[**Numeric Identifier 97839**].  There was initially concern for pulmonary embolism but
the patient refused heparin gtt and CTA.  He was admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] as an NSTEMI and for DOE.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was comfortable. He denied
lower extremity edema, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  He was not experiencing palpitations.  His
nephrologists have been aggressively dialyzing him for his
pleural effusions and he was at his dry weight.  Although he
endorsed a low grade fever in the [**Hospital1 3597**] emergency room he
otherwise denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain or dysuria since discharge.
.
Since admission he has had a persistent oxygen requirement
ranging from 2 to 4 L nasal canula.  Antibiotics were
discontinued on admission.  He underwent echocardiogram on
[**2102-5-29**] which showed improvement of his ejection fraction to
60%, diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
He underwent right sided thoracentesis on [**2102-5-29**] complicated by
the development of a small basilar pneumothorax.  600 cc
serosangionous fluid was removed and fluid studies were
consistent with transudate.  He underwent hemodialysis on
[**2102-5-29**] and [**2102-5-30**] with blood pressures ranging from 90s to
100s systolic.  He was evaluated by thoracic surgery for
potential VATS decortication and pleurodesis and was felt not to
be a surgical candidate.
.
He first triggered at [**2026**] on [**2102-5-30**] for hypotension and
hypoxia with blood pressure of 88/64 and O2 sats of 86% on 3L.
T max was 99.9.  CXR showed reaccumulation of right sided
pleural effusion.  Blood cultures were drawn.  He triggered
again on [**2102-5-31**] for hypotension to the 60s systolic and
somnolence.  ABG at that time was 7.31/58/79 on 4L nasal canula.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, QTc 485, TWF II,
III, avF, TWI V1-V3, compared to prior dated [**2102-5-30**] TWI were
more prominent.  He had a right EJ 18 g placed and received 2 L
normal saline bolus and was transferred to the MICU.  He did not
receive antibiotics prior to MICU transfer.
.
On arrival to the MICU he was persistently hypotensive to the
70s.  Peripheral dopamine is currently running at 20 mcg/kg/min
with blood pressures in the 70s systolic.  He has received a
total of 4L normal saline. He had a left sided subclavian line
placed.  He had a stat echocardiogram which was unchanged from
prior study dated [**2102-5-29**].
