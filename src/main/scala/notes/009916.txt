Type 2 dens fracture, with slight posterior displacement of the

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o F s/p fall who presents with neck pain. C-spine imaging
shows type II odontoid fracture with posterior angulation ad
deformity. She was admitted to the ICU with a hard c-collar at
all times. She was intact neurologically. On [**8-30**], patient
remained stable. L wrist films were ordered for L wrist pain.
Due to her history of alcohol consumption, she was placed on a
CIWA scale. She did not require ativan per CIWA protocol. She
was transferred to the floor in stable condition. Plastic
Surgery (hand) splint the L hand and recommended follow-up 8/1
in hand clinic for further evaluation. Sodium was noted to be
low throughout her hospital stay, likely secondary to inadequate
PO intake while awaiting possible surgical correction for her
hand and underlying lung disease. Fluids were discontinued and
she was discharged in stable condition with instructions to have
sodium checked at the rehabilitation facility to ensure
normalization with diet. The odontoid fracture will need to be
followed as an outpatient.

The patient was discharged in stable condition with written
instructions concerning precautionary instructions and the
appropriate follow-up care.  All questions were answered prior
to discharge and the patient expressed readiness for discharge.
She will remain in collar for cervical spine protection until
follow-up.
