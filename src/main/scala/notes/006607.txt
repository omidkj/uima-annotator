FINAL REPORT


INDICATION: 52-year-old male with status post CABG, now with
status post
sternal closure. Evaluate for large bowel dilatation.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to [**2106-8-18**].

TECHNIQUE: AP upright and supine views of the abdomen.

FINDINGS: The patient is status post median sternotomy. There
are two
mediastinal drains. There are skin staples overlying the
abdomen. There are
surgical clips in the right lower quadrant as well as left upper
quadrant.
There are vasectomy clips. There is a moderate amount of stool
within the
colon. There is no evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
There is
air in nondilated small bowel. The bowel gas pattern is
unchanged when
compared to [**2106-8-18**]. There is no evidence of colonic
dilatation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of colonic dilatation.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

FINAL REPORT


REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after sternal
reexploration and
closure.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs compared to [**2106-8-18**].

The appearance of the sternal wire, cardiomediastinal
silhouette, and lungs
has been unchanged. There is diffuse mild increase in the left
pleural
effusion which is still of small size and now partially entering
the major
fissure. There is no congestive heart failure or pulmonary
infiltrates. The
tip of the left PICC line is in the inferior portion of superior
vena cava.

IMPRESSION: Slightly increased pleural effusion on the left,
still small.
Otherwise, no change.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No mass or
thrombus in the RA or RAA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**1-18**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or
right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed. . The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**7-18**] for pre-op workup for cabg. Right groin US done
to r/o fistula or pseudoaneurysm. Vertigo was treated with
phenergan. Underwent cabg x4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**7-22**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on neosynephrine and
propofol drips.Extubated and briefly on milrinone drip and
repeat echo/cultures done.
Amiodarone started for a fib and off milrinone on POD #2. Echo
showed no pericardial effusion. Transfused to Hct of 30 and
chest tubes removed with foley on POD #3. Transferred to the
