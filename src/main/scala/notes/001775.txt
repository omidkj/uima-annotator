History of Present Illness:
77 YO gentleman with history of multiple TIAs s/p recetn CEA on
[**4-20**] brought into ED by ambulace for hypoxemia and respiratory
failure. Dr. [**Known lastname **] underwent CEA on [**4-20**] and by accounts had an
uneventful post operative course. By report he developed SOB
yesterday that progressivly worsened overnight. This morning he
was unable to get out of bed secondary to weakness. EMS was
called and by their report he was found supine and purple in
bed. They placed on 15l NRB and O2 Sats only came up to 90%. On
arrival to the ED his VS were notable for RR of 40 and sats in
the 90'2 on 15L. He was awake and alert on arrival with a
relativly clear mental status. He was only able to speak in one
or two word sentences. A CXR demonstrated new onset pulmonary
edema. He has no known pulmonary or cardiac history. He had no
reports of fevers, post op or pre-hospital. He denied cough to
ED staff.
.
In the ED he was initially placed on BiPap and had improvement
in his oxygenation. He was given a sublingual NTG and became
hypotensive, this precluded him receiving nitro GTT. He did not
receive IVF. He was noted to have several apneic episodes while
on BiPAP and was intubated due to respiratory fatigue. The
intubation was complicated by difficult to visualize airways and
he suffered a laceration of his lips. By report there was NO
blood in the ETT.
.
He is currently on FiO2 100 %/Peep 5/Rate 17/TV 600. Sedated on
fentanyl and versed. On 6mcg of dopa with BP 113/68. He has had
minimal UOP. Total UOP 100.
.
His labs are significant for a troponin of 1.13, leukocyotsis
21.6, Anion gap acidosis, Cr of 2.5 (baseline 0.9) and an
elevated lactate (6--->3 with intubation).

Imaging/Reports:

Chest x-ray [**2131-4-23**]
Endotracheal tube positioned appropriately.  NG tube appears
also
to be positioned appropriately, though the tip is excluded from
view.  Diffuse pulmonary edema with pleural effusions again
seen.

TTE [**2131-4-23**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the septum, anterior wall,
apex, and distal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30 %). No intraventricular thrombus is seen.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#).No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing/suboptimal
image quality, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be quantified. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensiver
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution) or
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. No definite valvular dysfunction.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-4-19**],
the left ventricular wall motion abnormalities are new and c/w
interim ischemia/infarction.

TTE [**2131-4-27**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF = 30 %) secondary to
extensive severe hypokinesis/akinesis involving the anterior
septum, anterior free wall, apex, and inferior septum. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared to the prior study of [**2131-4-23**], moderate mitral
regurgitation is now seen.

Renal US:
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 12.2 cm and the left kidney
measures 11.4 cm.  A 6 x 6 x 4 mm non-obstructing stone is
present in the right kidney interpolar region.  No left renal
calculus.  No hydronephrosis or mass seen in either kidney.  The
bladder contains a Foley, is minimally distended, and cannot be
assessed.
IMPRESSION:  6-mm nonobstructing right renal stone.  No
hydronephrosis

Cardiac Catheterization [**2131-5-1**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left-dominant system
demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD was occluded proximally and filled via

right-to-left collaterals. The LCx was dominant and had mild
disease.
The nondominant RCA was subtotally occluded but provided robust
collaterals to the LAD via an acute marginal.
2. Limited resting hemodynamcis revealed normal systemic
arterial
