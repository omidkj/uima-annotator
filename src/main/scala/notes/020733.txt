Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 76423**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with hypertension who presented with
chest pain and shortness of breath found to have likely NSTEMI
with ED course complicated by A Fib with RVR and CHF.
.
The patient developed respiratory distress at 10PM the evening
prior to admission while at home at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. At that time
sats were noted to be 88-89% on RA, RR 35. She had expiratory
wheezing and was described as anxious and restless. She refused
to take furosemide and her respiratory status worsened prompting
transfer to [**Hospital6 4620**]. At [**Hospital3 **], EKG
raised concern for NSTEMI. She received aspirin 325mg and
metoprolol 5mg IV x3 as well as furosemide 20mg. She was
hypertensive with improved respiratory status, RR 20's with O2
sats 93% on RA improved to 99-100% on 2L.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
presumed NSTEMI. EKG here revealed new anterolateral ST
depressions and elevated cardiac enzymes (trending downward).
The [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy clearly stated the patient's
goals of care were DNR/DNI. She was intiated on medical
management for NSTEMI with aspirin, beta-blocker and heparin
gtt. The patient developed A Fib with RVR at 5pm. Her heart rate
was not controlled with metoprolol or diltiazem boluses. She was
initiated on a digoxin load and started on a diltiazem gtt. She
developed shortness of breath and CXR revealed likely pulmonary
edema. She received furosemide.
.
In the ED, the patient received 5mg IV metoprolol x4, heparin
gtt (delayed initiation), diltiazem gtt now at 20, digoxin 0.5mg
and furosemide 40mg IV.
.
Of note, she had a recent fall and sustained a L tibial plateau
fracture. Her roommate witnessed the fall on [**2201-1-28**] and it was
felt to be mechanical. She was able to walk fine w/ minimal
pain. On [**1-30**], it was noted that her gait was markedly different
and that she was unstable on her feet. Exam was notable for
swelling in her right hip/leg raising concern for a fracture. XR
at the time revealed no R hip fracture and she was sent back to
rehab w/ tylenol prn for degenerative joint disease. She fell
again on [**2201-1-31**] (on her buttocks) and on [**2201-2-2**], she was noted
to have a boggy L knee that was not particularly warm or red but
that did have crepitance w/ movement. She had an XR performed
which revealed that she had a left proximal tibia and fibula
fracture. She is now in a LLE brace but requires maximal assist.
She is to be NWB on LLE x 8 weeks. She was getting tylenol RTC
for pain relief. Has an aide w/ her who states that her current
mental state, difficulty communicating, and difficulty
swallowing all started with her fall. The aide was told that the
patient likely had a stroke, but it is unclear where this
information came from as it is not documented in any of the
notes from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. She is currently on pureed diet,
thickened liquids and aspiration precautions. She has been
repeatedly noted to have a low appetite and to be refusing
medications, raising staff concern for dehydration and
malnutrition.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 76425**] was admitted with an NSTEMI with a course
complicated by A Fib with RVR and CHF.  She was DNR/DNI and had
no invasive procedures, including cardiac catheterization.  She
was continued on 48 hours of heparin upon hospitalization, as
well as aspirin and atorvastatin.  She was not thought to be a
long-term anticoagulation candidate because of her recent
history of recurrent mechanical falls.  Echocardiogram was
deferred as it was felt that the results would not change
management given her goals of care.

The day after admission, she returned to AFib with HR in the 130
- 140's refractory to a diltiazem drip.  She remained
hemodynamically stable during this period.  She was
pharmacologically cardioverted with procainamide on [**2201-2-11**] to
sinus rhythm with HR 50 - 60's.  This resulted in improved SOB
with less tachypnea.  Unfortunately, she returned to AFib with
RVR the following day, again refractory to diltiazem drip.  She
was noted to have pauses with hypotension when she converted
from AFib to SR.  She was started on amlodipine 100 mg QD and
taken off all nodal agents, including metoprolol.

On [**2201-2-13**] her blood pressures were fairly high and she was
restarted on lisinopril 20 mg QD (half of her home dose of 40 mg
QD) with hydralazine PRN for breakthrough SBP > 170.  She was
also placed on magnesium oxide 400 mg PO QD.

On admission, she was noted to have a leukocytosis and relative
hypothermia (with T ~95 degrees).  UA was negative.  Chest x-ray
showed a questionable opacity, and she was started on a seven
day course of cefpodoxime for a possible pneumonia.

She was noted to have renal failure, the chronicity of which was
unknown. In [**2199**], her creatinine was 0.9; it was 1.2 on
admission on [**2201-2-10**].  She likely had some degree of ARF from
poor forward flow in the setting of AFib with RVR and CHF, and
her creatinine improved to 1.0 with better rate control.

Patient however returned to AFib with RVR and became hypotensive
and progressively lethargic. She did not respond to rate
controlling agents or fluid challenges. Goals of care were
re-addressed with family; patient was made CMO after acute
dec
