Pertinent Results:
[**2181-6-12**] FIBRINOGE-549 PT-12.1 PTT-30.5 INR-1.0
[**2181-6-12**] WBC-5.9 RBC-3.96 HGB-9.2 HCT-27.7 MCV-70 PLT-193

[**2181-6-12**] PELVIC MRI
Low anterior placenta with findings concerning for placenta
percreta with involvement of the anterior abdominal wall at the
level of the lower uterine segment, and with unchanged
questionable involvement of the bladder wall, but no definite
evidence of mucosal penetration. Ultrasound could possibly be
helpful in the evaluation of the anterior abdominal wall,
particularly for planning of the surgical approach. For
evaluation of the bladder, cystoscopy may be helpful as
previously suggested.

[**2181-6-20**] CT HEAD
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Slight asymmetry of the frontal horns of the lateral
ventricles, however no definite mass lesions identified. If
clinical suspicion remains high, an MR may be helpful.

[**2181-6-19**]
CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions with
atelectasis.

[**2181-6-22**]
CTA CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiloculated pelvic fluid collection is likely
hemoperitoneum in resolution, though superinfection is possible.
The collection is amenable to percutaneous drainage.
2. Acute pulmonary embolus to apical segmental branch of right
upper lobe pulmonary artery.
3. Worsening of multifocal pneumonia and bilateral now moderate
pleural effusions.
4. Generalized anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
26y/o G4P2012 with known placenta acreta admitted at 34+4 weeks
with lower abdominal pain.
.
Mrs [**Known lastname 3095**] was admitted for close observation and bedrest.
Fetal testing was reassuring. [**Last Name (un) **] followed her to assist in
management of her diabetes. A repeat MRI on the day of admission
revealed findings concerning for placenta percreta with
involvement of the anterior abdominal wall at the level of the
lower uterine segment, and with unchanged questionable
involvement of the bladder wall, but no definite evidence of
mucosal penetration. Due to the findings concerning for placenta
percreta, in addition to her left lower quadrant tenderness, the
decision was made to move up her delivery date to [**2181-6-15**]. Please
see the operative report for further details. Briefly, her
cesarean delivery was complicated by excessive hemorrhage
requiring supracervical hysterectomy and abdominal packing.
During this operation the patient received 15 units of packed
red blood cells, 10 units of fresh frozen plasma, 1 unit of
cryoprecipitate, 3 units of platelets. The patient was then
taken to the operating room on [**2181-6-18**] for exploratory
laparotomy, removal of pelvic packing, cystoscopy, removal of
cerclage.
.
Patient was in the ICU from [**2181-6-15**] through [**2181-6-22**]. She was
briefly called out to the floor on the evening of [**2181-6-22**] but
returned to the ICU for respiratory distress in the setting of
tachycardia and fever. Patient was transferred back to the floor
on [**2181-6-25**].

Brief hospital course by organ system:

*) NEURO:
- Patient underwent CT head on [**2181-6-20**] for delirium and
disconjugate gaze on exam, which was negative. Patient's pain
was controlled with IV Toradol, oxycodone, and ibuprofen. The
day prior to discharge, the patient expressed significant
anxiety and urgency regarding going home. She was started on
Lorazepam, and was seen by social worker.

*) CARDIOVASCULAR:
- Patient had persistent tachycardia immediately post
operatively which was most pronounced with activity. Patient
underwent two CTA chest studies. Initial study was negative for
PE but showed multifocal pneumonia. The second study showed
worsening multifocal, small segmental branch pulmonary embolism,
and worsening pulmonary effusions with generalized anasarca. The
patient was started on antibiotics and received diuresis. Her
tachycardia resolved.

*) RESPIRATORY:
- Please see CV above
- Briefly, the patient remained intubated post operatively, but
was extubated without problems on [**2181-6-19**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] was
persistently tachycardic and underwent CTA chest which revealed
multifocal pneumonia. The patient initially received a 7 day
course of Cipro/Vanco/Flagyl. However, the patient was noted to
be febrile, with worsening respiratory status requiring transfer
back to the ICU. Repeat CTA chest revealed worsening PNA and the
patient was started on Cipro/Miropenem/Vanco after she underwent
a miropenem desensitization protocol. The patient was also noted
to have a pulmonary embolus and she was started on
anticoagulation. Her respiratory status improved greatly. Upon
discharge, she was treated with lovenox 90mg [**Hospital1 **].

*) HEME:
- Throughout the hospitalization the patient received a total of
22u pRBC, 12u FFP, 2 units of cryo, and 4 units of platelets. At
the time of discharge, patient's hematocrit and coags were WNL

*) FEN/GI:
- The patient was noted to have generalized anasarca and
underwent diuresis both throughout the ICU stay as well as on
the floor with IV lasix.
- Patient was started on TPN briefly while awaiting return of
her bowel function.
- Patient's diet was slowly advanced.

*) ID:
- Please see CV / Resp above, but briefly, the patient was
initially received a 7 day course of Cipro / Vanc / Flagyl for
multifocal pneumonia, but continued spiking temperatures. An ID
consultation was obtained and the patient's antibiotics were
changed to Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Miropenem for 3 days.
At the time of the discharge,
