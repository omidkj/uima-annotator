Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 yo F with hx of Schizophrenia, DM2, COPD
last FEV1 60% predicted [**4-18**](with recent hospitalization at
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 70311**] with hypoxemia and UTI).  The patient was
reportedly called by her family this AM - when she did not
answer, they were alarmed and called the police who went to her
home.  The police found her confused, reportedly "frothing" at
the mouth, incontinent.  EMS brought her to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, initial VS were T103.4 P138 BP117/57 RR34 Sat88% nrb.
Her sats eventually improved on high flow/NRB to mid-90s.  Then
placed on Bipap with O2 Sat 94%.  On exam, she was responsive to
voice, slowed. answering questions appropriately.  CXR showed
low lung volumes and previously seen retrocardiac/RLL opacities
due to atelectasis versus infection.  She had a urinalysis,
which was floridly dirty. She was given CTX, vanco, azithro and
4 L IVF. On transfer, BP reportedly in the 90s systolic.

On arrival to the MICU, her VS were T100.8 HR110 Sat90 on
60%Hi-Flow, RR22.  She is answering all questions.  She is fully
oriented to person, place, time, purpose, and can recite phone
numbers for her next of [**Doctor First Name **].  She complains of pain in the right
lower leg which has been ongoing for several weeks.  She also
notes dysuria, urinary frequency, and malodorous urine since
[**2199-7-8**].  She did finish a course of cefpodoxime for a recent UTI
several weeks ago.  She actually denies shortness of breath
currently, as well as chest pain, chest pressure, pleurisy.  She
notes cold-like symptoms of congestion, scant cough, sore
throat, malaise since her last discharge about 3 weeks ago.  She
finished her azithromycin and prednisone from her last COPD
exacerbation about a month ago. She remains compliant with home
COPD regimen per her report. She continues to smoke cigarettes
but denies recent marijuana use. No recent sick contacts.

She recently presented similary to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 70311**] with
hypoxemia and UTI and was immediately weaned to 2LNC on arrival
to the MICU. She was treated for a COPD exacerbation with a
prednisone taper and azithromycin course, as well as
Ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime for urinary tract infection that grew
out klebsiella pneumoniae.  Note was made at that time of
numerous medication reconciliation issues.  She was admitted in
[**3-/2199**] with a fall, possibly secondary to psychiatric
medications and UTI (coag- staph), and had established pulm care
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] since that time.

Spoke with her friend [**Name (NI) 71549**] who speaks with her regularly- she
mentions that her respiratory status has been OK recently.
