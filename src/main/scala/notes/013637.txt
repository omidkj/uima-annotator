Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Fosamax / Dilantin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
L temporal mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L temporal open biopsy


History of Present Illness:
85 yo F seen on [**7-6**] at OSH for dizziness, feeling "spacy";
she was readmitted today w/ confusion. Head CT shows large L
temporal mass, contrast enhancing. Patient received loading dose
of Dilantin and Decadron. Rapid tongue swelling thereafter
prompted her intubation for airway protection. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.

Past Medical History:
- rheumatic heart disease
- mitral regurg , echo in 03: EF 75%, moderate TR
- PVD, on chronic anticoagulation for graft
- s/p ax-bifem bypass [**2166**]

Physical Exam:
Intubated, ventilated on AC 100% 500x14 peep 5
Not sedated but received vercuronium at time of intubation, then
propofol and versed;
Pupils small, isocore, symteric, reactive 2->1.5; corneal: head
movement in response, bilat.;
Somnolent, not arousable; does not open eyes to pain; does not
follow commands; semi-purposeful movements of L and R UE to
pain;
withdraws R and L LE to pain; DTRs [**Name (NI) **] 1+ bilaterally, Ach trace
bilaterally, [**Last Name (un) **]: no movement bilat.;


Pertinent Results:
MRA Brain [**2169-7-20**]: There is a large lobulated and ill-defined
enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe, which extends along
the fiber tracts and cross the sylvian fissure extending into
the left frontal lobe. The enhancing portion of the mass
measures 4.8 x 3.2 cm, and on T2-weighted images, the mass is
predominantly T2 hypointense, which may reflect
hypercellularity. There is a component of T2 hyperintense signal
swelling the surrounding white matter. This may be edema and/or
tumor. There is flattening of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
ventricle, however, no significant midline shift is noted. There
are prominent T2 hyperintense foci in the cerebral white matter,
probably due to underlying chronic small vessel ischemia. Some
of the sequences are limited due to motion artifact.

Head CT [**2169-7-25**]: The patient is status post interval left
temporal craniotomy, with expected postoperative hemorrhage and
pneumocephalus at the biopsy cavity, as well as anterior to the
left frontal lobe. There is linear high density in the left
temporal lobe likely representing hemorrhage along the biopsy
tract, as well as high density tracking along the sulci in this
region consistent with some subarachnoid blood. There is at most
2 mm of rightward shift of the midline structures, unchanged.
Effacement of the left perimesencephalic and widening of the
left ambient cisterns, with mass effect upon the ipsilateral
cerebral peduncle, are also unchanged, and relate to the
extensive vasogenic edema in the left temporal and frontal
lobes. There is also bihemispheric periventricular white matter
hypodensity corresponding to the chronic micro-ischemic change
demonstrated previously . Visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear. The soft tissue structures
demonstrate subcutaneous emphysema in the region of the biopsy
as well as skin staples along the left scalp.

MRI Head [**2169-7-26**]: The study is somewhat limited secondary to
patient motion. The patient is status post craniotomy for open
biopsy of a large heterogeneously enhancing tumor in the left
temporal lobe that is unchanged in size today measuring 3.8 x
3.8 cm. Though the study is somewhat limited by motion, the
majority of tumor bulk is still present. Susceptibility imaging
demonstrates minimal-to-moderate amount of postsurgical
hemorrhage at the operative site. Significant vasogenic edema is
unchanged, mass effect and shift of the normally midline
structures is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the neurosurgery service and admitted to the
ICU. She was intubated and started on decadron and valproate for
seizure prophylaxis. Her anticoagulation was stopped and
vascular surgery was called regarding her ax-bifem bypass graft.
They recommended anticoagulation as soon as possible
postoperatively. Her INR continued to be elevated up to 4.0
despite coumadin discontinuation. A heme consult was called.
They recommended stopping the patient's subQ heparin which did
correct the patient's abnormal coagulation studies. She was
successfully extubated in the ICU. On HD7 patient was taken to
the operating room for an open temporal biopsy which intial
pathology revealed high grade glioma. Postoperatively her blood
pressure was controlled and she remained stable. She was able to
pass a swallow evaluation at the bedside and was out of bed with
physical therapy.
At the time of discharge, she was mildly confused but awake and
alert. She does not have any gross neurological deficits.
She was discharged to rehab on POD 4.
