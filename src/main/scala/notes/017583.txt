HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, this is a 77-year-old female who
had a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and
had a history of shortness of breath for which she was given
a diagnosis of CHF.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**3-4**] with fever to
104, and diagnosed with a bacteremia and Staph aureus.  She
underwent dialysis on [**3-6**] and experienced some
dyspnea after hemodialysis.  A cardiology consult was
obtained and a catheterization was done on the 21 which
showed LAD 70% at the origin and 80% mid, LCX 80% mid and
invading at OM1 origin.

The patient was continued to be treated with antibiotics, and
had a TE which showed 2+ MR, no vegetations, EF 35%.  The
patient had an episode of hypotension on the [**3-12**],
for which she was transferred to the CCU, was bolused and
then transferred back to the floor.  The patient underwent
Permacath placement on [**2160-3-18**] after she had had her
original one removed at admission to the hospital.
Predialysis labs on [**3-20**] showed a 9.3 white count,
hematocrit 30.1, platelets 271, BUN 44, creatinine 7.3.  The
electrolytes were within normal limits, as were the LFTs.
The patient had an INR of 1.3.

The patient underwent a CABG x 3 with a LIMA to the LAD and a
left saphenous to the circumflex, OM, and sequential to the
LIMA, a mitral valve repair with 26 mm annuloplasty band.
The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.
She was extubated on postoperative day one and was started on
oxacillin which was determined to need to be continued for
four to six weeks after the date of operation.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had a hypotensive event
after hemodialysis and developed some atrial fibrillation
which reverted back to sinus.  On postoperative day #4, the
patient was transferred to the floor and did well, having
only a PICC line placement on postoperative day #7 for the
long-term antibiotics.  The patient continued to have an
uncomplicated hospital course, ultimately being able to
tolerate a regular diet, ambulating reasonably well, and
having good po pain control.  The patient was felt to be
ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on
postoperative day #10 on long-term oxacillin.
