Date of Birth:   [**2105-9-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female
patient, with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease, peripheral vascular disease, and breast cancer,
status post right mastectomy many years ago, who presented to
[**Hospital6 1109**] on [**2177-10-7**] with shortness of
breath.  She also exhibited some signs of congestive heart
failure.

In the Emergency Department, she was noted to have EKG
changes and elevated cardiac troponin levels, and was started
on heparin, Nitroglycerin, aspirin and beta blockers.
Initially, the patient did not want to have cardiac
catheterization, but she did ultimately agree.  However, at
this time it was noted that she had a urinary tract
infection, so her catheterization was delayed.  She did
undergo cardiac catheterization eventually on [**10-17**], and
was found to have 90% left main occlusion, and a totally
occluded right coronary artery.  She was ultimately
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]
urgently for intra-aortic balloon pump placement due to the
severity of her coronary artery disease and anticipation of
operating room treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction
in the year [**2174**].
2. Diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy.
3. Peripheral vascular disease.
4. Cellulitis of right toe from a pressure ulcer.
5. Diverticulosis.
6. GERD.
7. Breast cancer, status post mastectomy many years ago.
8. Status post cholecystectomy.
9. Status post appendectomy.
10.Status post hysterectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She is a former
heavy smoker but quit 40 years ago, and denies alcohol
intake.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states multiple drug allergies as
follows:
1. Lanacane causes skin irritation.
2. Nitropatch causes skin irritation.
3. Persantine causes rash.
4. Percocet causes nausea/vomiting.
5. Motrin causes GI upset.
6. Tenormin causes hypotension.
7. Hytrin causes hypotension.
8. Inderal causes hypotension.
9. Altace causes hypotension.
10.Toprol causes hypotension.
11.Nifedipine causes hypotension.
12.Mirapex causes abdominal cramping.
13.Dalmane causes hives.
14.Ativan--the patient is apparently intolerant to but we do
not know what the response is to that.
15.Benzos--the patient is apparently intolerant to but we do
not know what the response is to that.

MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER FROM [**Hospital6 **]:
1. Heparin drip at 1,000 U/h.
2. Nitropaste.
3. Aspirin 325 mg qd.
4. Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
5. Digoxin 0.125 mg qd.
6. Neurontin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
7. Protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
8. Lantus Insulin 120 U subcutaneously q hs.
9. Regular Insulin 50 U subcutaneous tid.
10.Amoxicillin chronically of an unknown dose for chronic
urinary tract infection.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL:  Unremarkable.  Her
vital signs were stable.  Her echocardiogram revealed
moderate mitral regurgitation, and an ejection fraction of
20-30%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken directly to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for intra-aortic balloon
placement and subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit for medical management over the next few days
to optimize her for her coronary artery bypass graft.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2177-10-20**], where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x 2
with the saphenous vein to the LAD, and the saphenous vein to
the OM.  Postoperatively, she was on a dobutamine drip, as
well as Insulin and propofol.  She was transported from the
operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good
condition.  She had a bit of metabolic acidosis overnight and
was ultimately extubated the following day.

On postoperative day #1, she remained extubated and stable
from a respiratory standpoint.  Her dobutamine drip was
weaned to off, and her intra-aortic balloon pump was
discontinued also on postoperative day #1.  The patient
remained in the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic
monitoring purposes for the next two days.  She was weaned
off of an IV Insulin drip with the assistance of the [**Last Name (un) **]
consult service, and placed on subcutaneous Insulin, glargine
Insulin, as well as sliding scale regular Insulin coverage,
and her Insulin drip was ultimately discontinued on
postoperative day #3, and she was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor.  Her chest tubes
were also discontinued at that time.

The patient received a physical therapy consult later in the
day on postoperative day #3 and began to increase mobility
and ambulation.  On postoperative day #4, the patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm.  She had a blood pressure of
100/53.  Her room air oxygen saturation was between 90 and
95%, and she was continuing to progress from a physical
therapy standpoint.  The [**Last Name (un) **] service has continued to
follow the patient due to difficult management of blood
glucose.  She has had one or two episodes of a glucose as low
as the 50s, although she was not symptomatic at that time.

The patient continued to progress with cardiac
rehabilitation.  On postoperative day #6 noted to have some
increasing difficulty ambulating, according to the patient
because of her right [**Last Name 4241**] problem which she had
preoperatively.  Podiatry service was consulted, and they saw
the patient on [**10-26**], and they devised a foam dressing
of some sort that was placed on her right foot in order to
allow her to be more flexible with her weightbearing ability,
and this was placed on [**10-27**], and the patient stated
that it was a little bit easier for her to get around now
with that in place on her foot.

The patient also on [**10-27**], postoperative day #7, was
noted to have an isolated episode of complaining of not
feeling well with profuse diaphoresis.  At that time, she was
in normal sinus rhythm in the 70s, her blood pressure was
110-115 systolic, her oxygen saturation was 95% on room air,
and her blood glucose at the time was 199.  She, by physical
exam, was unremarkable.  She had a few bibasilar crackles and
otherwise her lungs were clear.  A chest x-ray was also
obtained at that time which showed some left lower lobe
atelectasis and small bilateral effusions which had decreased
from her previous film.  The episode resolved spontaneously
within 5-10 minutes.  Laboratory values which were obtained
were unremarkable.

The patient has remained hemodynamically stable over the
course of the next 24 hours or so, and she is now ready to be
discharged from the hospital to a rehabilitation facility to
continue with cardiac rehabilitation, increasing physical
therapy, and mobility.

Her most recent laboratory values are from [**10-27**] in the
afternoon and these revealed:  A white blood cell count of
12.4, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count of 502,000, sodium 132,
potassium 4.9, chloride 96, CO2 25, BUN 31, creatinine 1.2,
glucose 228.

The patient's physical exam is as follows:  Temperature 98.1,
pulse 74, in normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate 18, room
air oxygen saturation 95%.  The patient neurologically is
intact.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation with the
exception of a few bibasilar crackles.  Her coronary exam is
regular rate and rhythm.  Her abdomen is obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  She has trace peripheral edema in
both of her feet.  Her sternal incision, as well as leg
incisions are clean and dry with no erythema and no drainage,
and her Steri-Strips are intact.
