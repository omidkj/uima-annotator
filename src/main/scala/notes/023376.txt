CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old man, patient
of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2855**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20426**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**], who had complaints of
exertional angina and shortness of breath with activity.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 55-year-old man with no
cardiac history, experiencing chest pain and dyspnea for the
past two months.  He has had chest discomfort radiating down
both arms associated with dyspnea that occurs following
exertion, such as walking quickly or carrying heavy machinery
at work.  He denies any symptoms at rest.  The patient was
seen in his primary care provider's office.  An EKG at the
office was significant for ST depressions in V4 through V6.
These changes were compared to an EKG done in [**2114**].  Also of
note the patient was found to have a hematocrit of 30.8
during that visit.  The patient was advised to have a cardiac
catheterization as well as a colonoscopy following his
cardiac cath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, asthma,
cholecystectomy, polypectomy, facial and head surgery
following an MVA.

The patient states no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lisinopril 40 every day, Toprol 25
every day, and aspirin 325 every day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with CAD in her 60s.  Brother with
congenital heart defect, died at age 25.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, works as a production mechanic,
denies alcohol and tobacco use.  Height 5 feet 7 inches,
weight 170 pounds.

White count 7, hematocrit 30.8, platelets 211, INR 1.3,
sodium 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 109, CO2 29, BUN 14,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 95.

Neck is supple with no JVD and no bruits.  Chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac shows regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2.  Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities 2 plus throughout
the lower extremities.

The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and
underwent cardiac catheterization.  This showed an EF of 40
percent, a nonobstructive left main, and LAD with tandem 70
percent stenoses.  Circumflex was occluded proximally with
collaterals to the OMB from the LAD and RCA with mild diffuse
disease.  Following catheterization cardiothoracic surgery
was consulted.  The patient was seen and accepted for
coronary artery bypass grafting following a GI workup.

Colonoscopy showed multiple moderate nonbleeding diverticula
in the ascending colon and sigmoid, otherwise, normal
colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.  An EGD showed a large
hiatal hernia with multiple [**Location (un) 3825**] erosions in the proximal
gastric body and GI service recommended Protonix b.i.d.

Following these studies the patient was prepped then brought
to the Operating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting.
Please see the OR report for full details.  In summary, the
patient had a CABG times three with LIMA to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to the RPL and saphenous vein graft to
the OM.  His bypass time was 107 minutes with a crossclamp
time of 71 minutes.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer the patient was
in normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats per minute with a mean
arterial pressure of 66 and a PAD of 11.  He had Neo-
Synephrine at 0.5 mcg kilogram per minute and propofol at 20
mcg per kilogram per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His anesthesia was reversed.  He was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  Additionally, the
patient was weaned from all vasoactive IV medications.  He
remained hemodynamically stable throughout these maneuvers.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
surgical day.

On postoperative day one the patient's chest tubes were
removed.  He was begun on beta blockade as well as diuretics
and transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative
care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days
the patient had an uneventful hospital course.  His activity
level was increased with the assistance of the nursing staff
and physical therapy.  On postoperative day four it was
decided that the patient was stable and ready to be
discharged to home.

At the time of this dictation the patient's physical exam is
as follows:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 87 sinus rhythm.
Blood pressure 108/66, respiratory rate 20, weight
preoperatively 72.6 kg, at discharge 74.4 kg.

Physical exam shows in general no acute distress.  Neuro
shows alert and oriented times three, moves all extremities,
follows commands, nonfocal exam.  Pulmonary shows clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac shows regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2.  Sternum is stable.  Incision with Steri-
Strips, open to air, clean and dry without drainage or
erythema.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused with trace edema.  Left lower extremity endoscopic
harvest site with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry.

The patient is to be discharged home with visiting nurses.
He is to follow up in the wound clinic in two weeks.  Follow-
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] in three to four weeks and follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.

Patient's condition at the time of discharge is good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
