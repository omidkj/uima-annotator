Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Left ankle pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left ankle fusion


History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with h/o CAD, HTN, HC, ?AF (on coumadin - per
pt b/o stents), RA, multiple prior myocardial infarctions s/p
multiple stents, and recent in-[**First Name3 (LF) **] thrombosis of OM2 [**First Name3 (LF) **] in
[**2115-4-17**] in the setting of discontinuation of his clopidogrel for
5 days in anticipation of the same elective surgery, now again
admitted for elective left ankle fusion for rheumatoid
associated arthritis, found to have an NSTEMI post-[**Hospital 7375**]
transferred to Medicine for further management.
.
Since the PTCA to his OM2 in-[**Hospital **] thrombosis, the patient says
he is back to his usual baseline. He does get reproducible
angina with exertion (working in the yard), but very
infrequently gets angina at rest (this is also longstanding).
What limits his activity currently is his severe left ankle
pain. Before his ankle began really bothering him, about a year
ago, he was walking three miles on the treadmill everyday with
occasional nitroglycerin use, and no shortness of breath. Now he
simply can't exercise secondary to the pain.
.
He used to smoke remotely, three PPD but quit in the 70s. He
doesn't recall having any pulmonary problems, and denies any
dsypnea.
.
He underwent left ankle fusion on [**6-28**]. His coumadin has been
held since Sunday ([**6-22**]). He was continued on ASA and Plavix for
the procedure, per cardiology and orthopedics, as his prior
in-[**Month/Day (2) **] thrombosis occurred while off Plavix. Post-operatively,
he developed new ST depressions in I and aVL as well as a bump
in his cardiac enzymes. He was started on a heparin drip and
transferred to medicine.
.
Of note, post-OP course was also complicated by nose bleed, now
s/p nose packing. His Hct dropped from admission Hct of 35 to 25
post-OP. EBL during operation was 400cc.
.
On arrival to the medicine floor, his VS were stable. He denied
any CP throughout the hospital stay, only minimal chest pressure
lasting a few seconds shortly prior to admission. Also no SOB or
palpitations. He denies any dizziness and did not note any blood
from below. He did remember blood coming from his oropharynx and
nose post-operatively.
.


Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Hypercholesterolemia
3) Coronary artery disease, status post multiple MIs with
stents, last PTCA [**4-17**] as above secondary to in-[**Month/Year (2) **] thrombosis
of OM2 while holding Plavix. Otherwise has had stents to
proximal and mid LAD, D1, LCx, OM2, and multiple
atherectomies/PTCAs. On coumadin, clopidogrel, and ASA given
apparent hypercoagulability.
4) Congestive heart failure, EF 30%
5) Rheumatoid arthritis
6) Glucose intolerance
7) ?AF, on coumadin (per patient on coumadin b/o stents; per one
recent cardiology OMR note on coumadin for AF)

Echo [**1-/2114**]: EF 30%, posterolateral hypokinesis
.
LAST CATHETERIZATION [**2115-4-16**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed two vessel disease. There was mild disease in the LMCA.
The LAD revealed widely patent stents. The LCx had a 30% ISR of
the proximal OM2 [**Month/Day/Year **] and total occlusion of the OM2 stents
distally. The RCA was totally occluded proximally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an opening aortic
pressure of 111/63mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. The [**Month/Day/Year **] thrombosis of the OM2 was treated with thrombectomy
and
balloon angioplasty using a 2.0 mm, 2.5 mm and a 3.0 mm
balloons. The final angiogram showed partially reestablished
flow with no residual
stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation. (see PTCA comments)

5. IVUS intorrogation of the OM2/LCX/LMCA did not show any
significant lesions. It revealed a MLD of 2.1 X 2.3 mm. (see
PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Late [**Month/Day/Year **] thrombosis of OM2 stents.
2. Successful PTCA of the OM2.
3. IVUS examination of the OM2/LCX/LMCA showing no critical
lesions.
