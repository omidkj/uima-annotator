Central airway obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
58F with COPD, anxiety and bipolar, transferred from [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital with new diagnosis of large central lung mass causing
respiratory distress that required emergent intubation.  She was
intially admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital 3 days ago with shortness
of breath, cough, malaise x2 weeks s/p failing a trial of Avalox
as an outpatient.  CXR done in the OSH ER showed (by report
only) a very large left mid and lower lobe infiltrate with air
fluid level suggesting emypema.  CT chest (report) showed
complex, large [**Location (un) 21851**] in mediastinum obliterating L main
PA, L main bronchus, and resulting in near complete
opacification of mid-to-lower left lung.  She was started on
Zosyn and Levaquin for pneumonia, Solumedrol for COPD flare, and
sedation for extreme anxiety.

She then underwent bronchoscopy with FNA on [**4-30**], which
showed>75% narrowing of left mainstem bronchus at its most
proximal portion and then quickly leading into 100% obliteration
secondary to extrinsic compression.  FNA was done, which showed
malignant cells, unclear whether nonsmall cell vs. small cell
vs. potential mix of pathology.  L vocal cord was also noted to
be immobile,
suggesting involvement of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.

On [**5-1**], she developed respiratory distress and became apneic,
and had to be emergently intubated during a code blue.  She was
transfused 1U PRBC's and started on Fe for anemia.  She was
stabilized and sedated, and transferred here for further care by
Interventional Pulmonology.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2162-5-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Central left upper lobe mas contiguous with a mediastinal
lymph node conglomeration, most consistent with advanced lung
cancer. There is direct contact and mild compression on the
aortic arch, encasement and obstruction of the left pulmonary
artery, and encasement of the left main stem bronchus with
partially obstructing mass distally.
2. Dominant central cavity in left lung is likely related to
necrotizing post- obstructive pneumonia, but cavity component of
neoplasm is also possible.
3. Multifocal bilateral pneumonia. Multiple left-sided cavities
are consistent with necrotizing pneumonia.
4. Diffuse right peribronchial thickening may be due to either
neoplastic infiltration or infection.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.
6. Cirrhosis and small amount of ascites.





Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted [**2162-5-2**]. On HD 2, he had a  flexible
bronchoscopy was  at the bedside in the intensive care unit
through an endotracheal
tube. There was near complete occlusion of the left main-stem
bronchus with extrinsic compression was noted. The bronchoscope
could not be  advanced past this obstruction. Purulent sputum
was seen  emanating from the left main-stem bronchus. On the
right, severe bronchomalacia was seen in the mainstem bronchus.
A small
amount of purulent secretions seen in the right upper lobe,
bronchus intermedius, right middle and lower lobe segmental
bronchi, were all suctioned clean. Vancomycin and Zosyn were
started empirically for pneumonia.  A BAL was sent.  later on HD

2, she was taken to the OR for a rigid bronchoscopy.  Please see
operative note for full details.  A biopsy of the occlusive
airway lesion revealed a non small cell lung cancer.  Her LMSB
was balloon dilated to 12 mm.  A 14 x 40 mm covered metal stent
was placed.  A CT scan was done which showed central left upper
lobe Mass contiguous with a mediastinal lymph node
conglomeration, most consistent with advanced lung cancer. There
is direct contact and mild compression on the aortic arch,
encasement and obstruction of the left pulmonary artery, and
encasement of the left main stem bronchus with partially
obstructing mass distally. Dominant central cavity in left lung
is likely related to necrotizing post- obstructive pneumonia,
but cavity component of neoplasm is also possible.  Multifocal
bilateral pneumonia. Multiple left-sided cavities are consistent
with necrotizing pneumonia. Diffuse right peribronchial
thickening may be due to either neoplastic infiltration or
infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial
effusion. Cirrhosis and small amount of ascites.  On HD 2, she
was extubated successfully.  A flexible bronchoscopy was done at
the bedside- the stent was patent and secretions were aspirated.
 Saline nebs and Mucomyst nebs were started and Mucinex was
started.  On HD 3, she continued to be stable.  A flexible
bronch was again performed at the bedside for therapeutic
aspiration of secretions.  Overnight she had an episode of
mania.  Psych was consulted (see note)recommended continue
Seroquel and Haldol prn for agitation. She was seen by radiation
oncology who recommended starting XRT .  She received the first
of ten 300 cGy treatment today.  She tolerated the treatment
well but was mildly paranoid. The patient was stable and to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital.
