chloride 100, CO2 26, BUN 22, creatinine 0.5, glucose 119.

CHEST X-RAY:  Hyperinflated.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus rhythm at 75 with mild left
ventricular hypertrophy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature of 98.1, heart rate 88,
blood pressure 90/50, respiratory rate 20, and O2 saturation
is 93% on room air.  Alert and oriented times three.  Neck is
supple.  Positive carotid bruits left greater than right.
Breath sounds clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart
sounds regular, rate, and rhythm 4/6 systolic murmur greatest
at the left sternal border.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,

Patient was admitted to the cardiothoracic service.  The day
after admission, she was seen by the dental service and
cleared for [**Hospital1 8813**] valve surgery.  Also that day, she was
seen in the Vascular Laboratory, and had carotid Dopplers
which showed normal rate ICA and left ICA with 60-90%
stenosis and normal vertebrals.

The following morning she is brought to the operating room,
please see the OR report for full details.  In summary, she
had an [**Hospital1 8813**] valve replacement with a 19 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Paramount pericardial valve.  Her bypass
time was 105 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 89 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well, and was brought to the

Once in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, the patient

which resolved with volume over the first 24 hours.  On
postoperative day one, she was weaned from her Levophed drip.
Her sedation was discontinued, and she was successfully
extubated.

On postoperative day two, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  The chest tubes, Foley catheter,
pacing wires, and central line were all discontinued, and she
was transferred from Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to
the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

Over the next several days on the floor, the patient worked
with the nursing staff with Physical Therapy to increase her
activity level.  On postoperative day four, it was decided
that she would be stable and ready for discharge to home on
the following morning.

At the time of discharge, the patient's physical exam was as
follows:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.2, heart rate 63 sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 115/69, respiratory rate 14, and O2
saturation is 99% on 2 liters.  Weight preoperatively was
