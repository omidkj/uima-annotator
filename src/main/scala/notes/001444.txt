History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112140**] is a 69 year old man with atrial fibrillation,
diabetes, and hypertension who presents with confusion and
respiratory failure. He was admitted yesterday to an OSH with
the new onset of shortness of breath. He was given a diagnosis
of CHF and discharged today. He went home and suddenly had the
onset of acute shortness of breath with diaphoresis. He
represented to the same hospital. He was noted to be pale, cool,
diaphoretic, and hypertensive. He was placed on BIPAP. He was
noted to have ST depressions in V3-6 on EKG. He had a chest xray
which showed fluid overload. He was given aspirin 325mg, ativan
2mg IV, dilt 10mg/hr, and nitro paste prior to transfer. Of
note, he has a recent history of right 3rd nerve palsy. He was
supposed to have an MRI with neuro on Monday.
In the ED he was severely obtunded and minimally responsive to
painful stimuli. He was also hypertensive to the low 200's. He
was immediately intubated. He was given cefepime and
levofloxacin to cover for urinary/pulmonary pathogens. A CT head
was obtained given a reported history of a headache and being on
anticoagulation. It did not show any acute processes. In the ED
neurology was consulted given concern for possible brainstem
stroke vs hypertensive encephalopathy.
They recommended covering with empiric meningitis coverage with
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. He
reportedly had a headache. They would like an LP, but it is
being deferred given the INR of 2.6. They also wanted an MRI and
MRA head/neck as an aneurysm could cause a partial 3rd nerve
palsy. They have a low threshold for continuous EEG if mental
status does not improve.
His labs were significant for a WBC of 19.8, potassium of 6.8,
creatinine of 1.1. He received insulin and glucose with eventual
lowering of potassium to 4. During the ED stay Mr. [**Known lastname 112140**] became
hypotensive in the setting of propofol use. He was switched to
fentanyl and midazolam, but remained severely hypotensive.
Levophed was started. A FAST exam was performed which was
negative. A bedside echo showed very poor squeeze and possible
small pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted to do an
emergent echo. This revealed an EF of 40% without any
significant effusion. A central line was placed in the R IJ. A
CTA was then done to look for aortic dissection. This showed a
bilateral pneumonia.
Pt's potassium elevated, given insulin/D50, calcium gluconate.
Vitals on transfer were 84 108/62 on 0.03 of levo. He received
all of the ordered antibiotics.
On arrival to the MICU,
