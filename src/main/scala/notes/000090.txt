[**2145-5-7**]: CT abdomen/pelvis
Large, [**Hospital1 **]-lobed ventral hernia contains multiple small bowel
loops.  There is evidence of incarceration, with mesenteric
kinking and multiple areas of abrupt narrowing at the entry and
exit points of the hernia.  Loops within and proximal to the
hernia are dilated up to 5-6 cm, with air-fluid levels. Several
regions of circumferential wall thickening, mucosal hyperemia,
and surrounding fluid raise concern for ischemia.  There is no
pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, or portal/mesenteric venous gas.

[**2145-5-8**] KUB:
Within this limitation, dilated small bowel loops in the left
lower quadrant are noted, likely representing the dilated
obstructive loop of bowel present in prior study.  NG tube tip
is in the stomach.

[**2145-5-18**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation with possible left anterior
fascicular
block. Borderline voltage criteria for left ventricular
hypertrophy. Modest ST-T wave changes that are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-5-14**] ventricular
premature contraction is absent. Otherwise, no other significant
diagnostic change

[**2145-5-19**] CXR (AP):
Mild pulmonary edema with small to moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 44910**] was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service on
[**2145-5-7**] for management of her abdominal pain secondary to a
small bowel obstruction/incarcerated ventral hernia. Given the
large size of her [**Hospital1 **]-lobed ventral hernia, in addition to Ms.
[**Known lastname 44911**] poor surgical candidacy, she was treated
conservatively via bowel rest, IVF, and nasogastric
decompression via NGT. Her labs, most notably, her lactate and
WBC were trended throughout her hospital stay and were noted to
be within normal limits. Ms. [**Known lastname 44910**] gradually responded well to
this treatment, and was noted to be much less distended and
tender to palpation by HD#2. She self-dc'ed her NGT overnight on
HD#2 without worsening of her symptoms. On HD#3, her abdominal
exam remained improving, and she was given a bowel regimen to
which she responded well. On [**5-11**], the patient was advanced to
clears but did not tolerate that well and was again made NPO.
Because of concern for increasing abdominal pain and worsening
SBO, the patient was taken to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection with
primary anastomosis. See operative note for details. Her skin
and subcutaneous tissue were closed. She was transferred to the
TSICU post-op.

ICU course:

Neuro: The patient remained sedated while intubated. Once
sedation was weaned, she responded appropriately in terms of
mental status. Her pain was controlled.

CV/Pulm: Her cardiovascular status was stable and she was
continued on b-blockers while in the ICU. She has a history of
congestive heart failure and her volume status was monitored
closely. She was edematous and diuresed with lasix [**Hospital1 **]. Her IVFs
were discontinued as well in order to improve her edema, and
instead albumin was given. She remained intubated post-op and
was able to be weaned and extubated on [**5-15**].

GI: Post-op, she had an NGT in place and was NPO. Her NGT was
removed on [**5-16**] and she was advanced to sips on [**5-17**]. Her
abdominal wound was covered with dry sterile dressing and an
abdominal binder was kept on at all times. Her incision remained
c/d/i.

GU: She had a foley in place. She had intermitent episodes of
low UOP and was bolused gently as needed, with goal of 15-20
cc/hr of urine.

Heme: Her hematocrit remained stable throughout her ICU course

ID: she was given clotrimazole cream for a fungal infection

Prophy: She received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
She was also continued on a H2 blocker.

Dispo: she was stable and ready for transfer to the floor on
[**2145-5-17**].

Once transferred to the surgical floor, Mrs.[**Known lastname 44912**] course by
system is as follows:

Neuro:  She's been oriented x 3 including the reason for her
admission.  Her pain has been treated with tramadol and
oxycodone PRN.  She has intermittent minor pain as expected
post-operatively.

Cardio:  Beta blockers have been continued.  She has been
hemodynamically stable with adequate rate control (70 - 90s).
Generalized edema 2 - 3+ persists.  Continue furosemid
