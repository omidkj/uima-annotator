History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old female with extensive medical
history including DM II, ESRD, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
s/p liver and kidney transplant in [**7-/2153**], who recently
underwent exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal
blood, exploration of retroperitoneal hematoma, and left
salpingo-oophorectomy for retroperitoneal bleed. Her post-op
course was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **], volume overload requiring
diuresis and CVVHD for ultrafiltration, gout flare. She also had
an abdominal wall hematoma required evacuation on [**4-11**] and stay
overnight for overvation. She was also treated for ESBL UTI with
Meropenem on [**4-14**]. Per report, patient was noted to be hypoxic

CXR [**2155-4-16**]:
FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph compared with [**2155-4-11**]
demonstrates
interval increase in bilateral basal and perihilar airspace
opacities with
increase in bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left
and fluid
tracking along the minor fissure. A left chest two-lead
pacemaker remains
stable in appearance. There is a feeding tube with its tip
positioned in the third portion of the duodenum.

TTE [**2155-4-17**]: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Renal US [**2155-4-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Progression of the abnormal appearance of renal transplant
vascularity,
now with diffuse reversal of flow in diastole. Renal vein
remains patent.
2. No significant change in appearance of the large midline/left

abdominopelvic and retroperitoneal hematoma.

CT Chest w/o constrast [**2155-4-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidations concerning for pneumonia
in the
setting of fever.
2. Asymmetrically distributed ground-glass opacities and smooth
septal
thickening, most likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
Infectious
etiology (such as viral) for these opacities is less likely.
3. Small, dependent left and small-to-moderate, partially
loculated right
pleural effusion.

Colonoscopy [**2155-4-26**]:
Friability and ulceration in the distal transverse colon,
splenic flexure and proximal descending colon compatible with
ischemic colitis
Normal mucosa in the hepatic flexure and distal ascending colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

EGD [**2155-4-26**]:
Normal esophagus.  Normal stomach.  Normal duodenum.




Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the ED and thought to have
pulmonary edema. Due to her high oxygen requirement and clinical
picture, she was given IV [**Known lastname 11573**] with minimal response. She was
admitted to the SICU where [**Known lastname 11573**] [**Known lastname **] was initiated. Below is
her hospital course by system:

1. Neurologic: mental status improved by hospital day 2.
Confusion was felt to be secondary to hypoxia and UTI. Psych
meds were continued. She was noted to have tremor and weakness
on her right side. Neurology was consulted and made
recommendations for  EEG to r/o seizures, head CT to eval
evolution of stroke. Keppra was continued at current dose. Head
CT wi
