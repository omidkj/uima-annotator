Chief Complaint:
Generalized tonic clonic seizure x2
Reason for MICU transfer: Seizure, PNA, CHF and r/o meningitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 99188**] is an 83 year-old woman with HTN, DM, lupus, CKD and
a history of seizure disorder who presents from home after two
seizures. Patient reports first sizure around 5:30pm with
generalized tonic clonic movements lasting about 4 minutes with
a second seizure lasting a shorter duration. Per daughter,
seizures in the past have been attributed to her lupus (?).

Initial vitals in the ED were 96.7 33 160/84 16 100%RA. Pt was
satting 90% on RA and was put on BiPAP at that time. Labs in the
ED were notable for WBC 9.1 71.9%N, HCT 38.3 (b/l 33) proBNP
2626, Cr 2.4 (b/l 1.4-1.5), Glucose 208, Lactate 2.2 and TropT
0.02. K was 6.6. UA was notable for 6 WBC and few bacteria with
nitr negative. CXR revealed pulmonary edema with suggestion of
LUL consolidation c/f PNA. A head CT scan revealed no acute
process. Given presenting complaint of seizures, meningitis was
considered but LP was deferred. Neurology was consulted and
advised emperic treatment for meningitis and starting keppra.
The patient received 750mg IV levofloxacin originally out of c/f
PNA. This was stopped in favor of azithromycin 500mg IV with the
thought that this had less risk of lowering seizure threshold.
For c/f meningitis, received 2g IV ceftriaxone, 2g IV
ampicillin, 600mg IV acyclovir, 1g IV vancomycin. For seizures
received 750mg IV levetiracetam. Also 10 units IV of regular
insulin for hyperkalemia, and 650mg rectal tylenol. Prior to
transfer pt was off Bipap. Vitals on transfer were

On arrival to the MICU, patient appears comfortable although
still requiring 10% nonrebreather but satting high 90s on this.
Denies pain. States her breathing feels much improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o F h/o HTN, DM, lupus, CKD and a history of seizure
disorder presents with hypoxia after 2 sequential seizures.

# HYPOXIA -> Patient reports that she occasionally has dyspnea
at home.  She has a known history of interstitial lung disease
based on prior chest CTs.  On presentation, she reported that
her dyspnea was worse than her baseline.  She was initially
found to be febrile to 101, tachypneic to the 30s, with O2 sats
in the low 90s.  She was initially started on BiPap in the ED,
and then transitioned to a 100% non-rebreather in the MICU.
Differential for her hypoxia included pulmonary edema given
known history of diastolic heart failure, pneumonia,
interstitial lung disease. Her O2 supplement was weaned from NRB
with antibiotics and additional lasix.  Repeat echocardiogram
suggested worsening diastolic heart failure.  Chest CT was done
after patient failed to notably improve after significant
diuresis and showed LUL and LLL consolidations as well as
chronic ILD.  Patient was continued on IV ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for presumed pneumonia.  Other than consolidations
on chest CT, there were no other overt signs of infection;
patient remained afebrile, without elevations in her WBC count.
However, she is chronically on steroids, which may have been
masking a possible infection.  Once weaned to 3L NC was called
out of MICU.  She continued to do well from respiratory
perspective and was satting in the high 90s on 2L O2.  At
transfer, she continued on IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and
had been diuresed a total of 3L.  On the floor, her antibiotics
were transitioned to PO cefpodoxime and azithromycin.  She
received one dose of lasix PO on the floor.  She was felt to be
euvolemic at that point (minimal crackles at bases, no JVD, no
LE edema).  She was taken off oxygen and was satting in the high
90s on room air.  Pulmonary saw her and felt that the
consolidations were most likely due to an aspiration
pneumonitis, not pneumonia. Pulmonary recommended outpatient
pulmonary follow-up for PFTs and follow-up of interstitial lung
disease. She was discharged with one additional day of
azithromycin and 3 more days of cefpodoxime.

# SEIZURES -> She initially presented with seizures, possibly
generalized tonic clonic seizure by description of the family,
with history of provoked seizure and possible epilepsy, although
unclear of the exact diagnosis.  Patient was not on AED at home.
 She initially had drowsiness, thought to be post-ictal.
Etiology of seizure likely multifactorial with underlying PNA on
chest imaging, and acute kidney injury causing medication
accumulation.  LP was attempted but was unsuccessful.  Her
clinical presentation was not consistent with meningitis (no
meningeal signs, not sensitive to light, full range of neck
motion without pain, no c/o headache); meningitis antibiotics
were discontinued.  Her mental status improved over the course
of her MICU stay.  She was started on Keppra 750 mg [**Hospital1 **].  No
further seizure activity was noted.  Per neurology, patient
should be maintained on keppra for seizure prophylaxis for at
least two years if seizure free, and likely for life.

# Acute renal failure on CKD.  Creatinine increased to 2.4 from
baseline of 1.4-1.5.  Thought to be pre-renal in the setting of
cardiac dysfunction, poor perfusion, and possi
