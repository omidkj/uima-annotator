of the left subclavian line ends in the upper superior vena
cava.

.
[**10-28**] EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to diffuse theta slowing
with shifting asymmetries but no consistent or lateralized
slowing. The record is consistent with a moderate diffuse
encephalopathy.
.
[**10-26**] CT CHEST ABD PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1.  Trach tube with its
tip in the origin of the right main stem bronchus. 2.
Nondisplaced comminuted superior sternal fracture  is unchanged.
3.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures. 4.  Right acetabulum
hardware is new since [**2112-10-11**]. 5.  Grade 3 splenic laceration
without evidence of extravasation. 6.  Unchanged appearance of
focal dissection at the aortic arch. 7.  Slightly increased
bilateral pleural effusions (now moderate) and pericardial
effusion (small).
.
[**10-26**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:  No intracranial bleed or
pneumocephalus but sinus fractures and likely hemorrhage in the
maxillary sinus; please refer to the today's dedicated CT of the
sinus for further details.
.
[**10-11**] CT Head: No ICH or edema. Complex facial fractures (nasal
fractures, anterior ethmoid wall, BL maxilla, and BL inferior
orbital)
.
[**10-11**] CTA chest/torso: Focal aortic dissection distal to left
subclavian artery. Minimal mediastinal hematoma. Small
intramural hematoma involving left common carotid artery. Grade
III splenic laceration. Right acetabular comminuted fracture.
.
[**10-13**] CTA chest (repeat): New large right pneumothorax occupying
approximately 50% of the hemithorax, with deep tissue air on the
right. Overall unchanged appearance of the focal dissection at
the aortic arch with outpouching measuring 5 x 10 mm,
representing possible small pseudoaneurysm just distal to the
left subclavian artery takeoff, unchanged since prior
.
[**10-19**] CXR: No PTX s/p chest tube removal; New left plate-like
atelectasis mid lung zone,

[**10-19**] RUQ US: GB is unremarkable, no wall edema or
pericholecystic fluid. Liver with fatty infiltration. no intra-
or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The portal vein is patent

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma team after preliminary
evaluation.  The patient was evaluated with CT scans, and
orthopedics was consulted for evaluation of the right acetabular
and RLE fractures.

Neuro: The patient was intubated and sedated on arrival to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED with a GCS of 3.  Follwoing extubation and cease of
sedation, his neurologic status has made steady improvement over
the course of his stay.  He has become increasingly more aware
of his surroundings with now all four extremities moving
spontaneously, following of simple commands, and nodding yes to
simple questions.  He is Babinksi negative.  All head scans
(MRI, CT) have been nonfocal.  His EEG was read significant only
for moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
.
CV: Vascular surgery was consulted for evaluation of aortic and
carotid injury; a carotid ultrasound was performed, as well as a
CTA. He was put on strict blood pressure and heart rate
restrictions, whcih were maintained with various
antihypertensives and beta blockers with good result.  No
surgical intervention was deemed warranted.  The patient's vital
sign parameters were liberalized when appropriate with good
result.  At the time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 22204**] was restarted on
his home PO blood pressure medication with a standing
breakthrough order for IV lopressor as necessary.  His rate and
pressure were within normal limits.
.
Pulm: The patient was intubated and sedated for much of his ICU
stay.  He failed to wean from the vent initially, and
subsequently had a tracheostomy placed with no complications and
good result.  The patient was weaned as [**Known lastname 8337**] from the vent
to trach mask.  He was routinely evaluated with chest x-rays for
pneumonia and other issues.  The patient initially required a
chest tubefollowing his accident for pneumothorax secondary to
rib fractures.  This chest tube was managed and removed in the
standard fashion without complication.  At the time of
discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 22204**] was satting 100 percent on 0.35 FiO2 trach
mask with no issues.
.
Prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 22204**] was evaluated by [**Hospital1 18**] Speech and
Swallow with the following summary:
SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname 22204**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] placement of the PMV with stable
vital signs and safe tracheal pressures, but made few attempts
to speak [**12-25**] his MS. The pt can wear the valve, but would
suggest wearing it with supervision at this point. I also
discussed with the MDs that the pt may have a cuff leak as I
attempted to inflate the cuff several times without success.
There was no concern for aspiration of oral or pharyngeal
secretions and he can likely tolerate an essentially cuffless
trach at this time.
.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
.
1.  ALWAYS DEFLATE CUFF PRIOR TO PLACING THE PASSY-MUIR VALVE!
.
2.  Monitor O2 Sats / respiration while valve is in place.
.
3.  Do not allow the patient to sleep with the valve in place.
.
4.  PMV wear schedule is up to the discretion of the nurse
and/or respiratory therapist.
.
5.  Remain NPO with continued tube feedings until pt's MS
improves further.
.
GI: Tube feeds were started when appropriate, and an open G tube
was placed as the patient was tube feed dependent initially.
