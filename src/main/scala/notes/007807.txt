Brief Hospital Course:

Mr. [**Known lastname 9995**] admitted with sepsis [**2-22**] to pneumonia and hepatic
abscess, went to IR for drainage he was transferred to the floor
on [**12-2**], his course was complicated by persistent hyperkalemia
[**2084-12-6**], and an episode of hypoglycemia on [**12-11**]. On [**12-13**] he
received a 500cc bolus and was transferred to IR for a
PTC/cholangiogram which showed biliary sludge in CBD, normal
intrahepatic biliary ducts, and placement of an int/ext biliary
drain, a hepatic artery radical was inadverdently cannulated and
this was immediately recognized and embolized. He was
transferred to TSICU for hypotension and tachycardia where he
was transfused 2 u pRBC and resuscitated, initial attempts to
wean to CPAP failed.

[**12-14**] He became acidotic on repeat attempt to wean to CPAP.
Nephrology was consulted on [**12-14**] for hyperkalemia and suggested
the patient might have type 1 RTA. A head CT was done to
evaluate mental status which showed no intracranial pathology. A
cortisol stim test showed adrenal insufficiency and
hydrocortisone was started at endocrinology's recommendation.
Transplant surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and recommended
ursodiol.

[**2173-12-15**]: Remained on vent for persistant acidosis.
Hydrocortisone tapered. Tube feeds diluted to 1/2 strength,
protein incr to 2g/kg/day. PTC output and stool output incr
proportionally w/TF incr. Vent weaned to CPAP o/n, ABGs slightly
improved.

[**2173-12-16**]: Extubated successfully. IVF KVO. Tube feeds were
advanced to full strength due to unchanged diarrhea, acidosis
gradually improved.

[**2173-12-17**] transferred to the floor.

[**Date range (1) 14898**] doing well on floor, tube feeds gradually advanced

[**2173-12-20**]: Mr. [**Known lastname 9995**] was found to be tachypneic on the floor
with worsening O2 sat and acidosis in the course of the day. An
attempt to manage fluid overload apparent on exam and his CXR
with lasix failed. He was intubated on the floor for a pH of 7.1
and subsequently transferred to the unit. After intubation he
required fluid resuscitation likely secondary to propofol
induced hypotension. A CTA chest was negative for PE.

[**2173-12-21**]: Started on IVF for decreased urine output.
Bronchoscopy and BAL were unremkarkable, tube feeds were
decreased. A bedside TTE performed by anesthesia showed EF 42%
and global hypokinesis. He did well on SBTs.

[**2173-12-22**]: Mr. [**Known lastname 9995**] had D5W increased to 75/hr for
hypernatremia with medications changed to D5W as much as
possible. A pull-back cholangiogram showed good drainage, and
the PTC was removed. Formal echo confirmed bedside findings, but
cardiology felt the patient's previous echo was similar, and
that he had possibly had an MI in early [**2173**].

[**12-23**] Extubated succesfully, hydrocortisone stopped at
endocrinology recommendation without taper after good response
on repeat [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim and hypertension. Started on cipro for
pseudomonas in BAL from [**12-21**]

[**12-24**] On morning rounds, was alert, oriented and conversing with
ICU staff. Shortly thereafter was found unresponsive with
hypertension (SBP>200). Head CT was done showing a large
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift. On discussion
between ICU staff and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], this was felt to be an
unrecoverable event, and on further discussion with the family
the patient was made CMO and terminally extubated. He expired
shortly thereafter
