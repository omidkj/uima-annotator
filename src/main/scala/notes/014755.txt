Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with Drug Eluting Stent to SVG to RCA


History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG
([**2086**]) s/p PCI [**2108**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presented
to our ED from [**Hospital3 **].  Patient reports progressive
shortness of breath yesterday evening beginning at 8PM.  He
notes that his shortness of breath has been worsening over past
several months - denies acute event last night.  No chest pain.
He did have some abdominal pain which he believe is c/w prior
episodes of MI.  He was taken to [**Hospital1 **] ER with symptoms.  EKG
at [**Hospital1 **] showed ST depressions in lateral leads.  He was
started on heparin gtt, given [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and beta blocker.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for intervention however in ambulance
had VF arrest.  He received 2 shocks with return to sinus
rhythm.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was taken immediately to
cath lab where he was found to have severe 3v disease with
patent but diseased SVG to RCA and patent LIMA.  A DES was
placed in the SVG to RCA successfully.  PCW 25.
.
On arrival to the CCU the patient is comfortable with no
complaints.  He arrives on a nonrebreather.  He is given 40mg IV
lasix x 1.  He reports that at baseline he has been
progressively short of breath with exertion.  He swims daily for
30 minutes and is able to ambulate around his house, but further
exertion causes extreme dyspnea.

.
EKG [**2110-9-28**] - Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact makes the limb
leads difficult to interpret. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. Poor R wave progression. There appears to be a
Q wave in lead III. Lateral ST segment depressions suggest
myocardial ischemia. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
Cardiac catherization (prelim) - COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
native
three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had diffuse
50-60% stenoses. The LAD had an origin 70-80% lesion and was
diffusely diseased, with competitive flow seen from the LIMA to
a diagonal. The LCx had proximal serial 80% lesions and an OM
branch was calcified with a 90% proximal stenosis. The RCA was
totally occluded proximally. 2. Arterial conduit angiography
demonstrated a SVG-RPDA which had a 95% proximal stenosis. The
LIMA-LAD was patent. There appeared to be two SVG grafts to the
left system which were occluded at the origin. 3. Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures (RVEDP 16 mm Hg, PCWP mean 30 mm Hg, respectively).
There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (PASP 54 mm
Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was moderately
elevated (SBP 170 mm Hg). The cardiac index was mildly depressed
at 2.17 l/min/m2. The systemic and pulmonary vascular
resistances were mildly elevated at 1778 dynes-sec/cm5 and 142
dynes-sec/cm5, respectively. 4. Successful PTCA and stenting of
the SVG-PDA with a 3.5x16 Taxus stent. Fianl angiography
revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA

comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Mildly depressed cardiac index.
5. Successful stenting of the SVG-RPDA.

Chest x-ray portable [**2110-2-28**]- IMPRESSION: Findings consistent
with CHF.
.
Echo - The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall
(rest of left ventricle contracts normally). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old male with CAD s/p CABG mult PCIs who presents from
[**Hospital1 **] after VF arrest found to have occlusion of SVG-PDA s/p
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**].
.
#. NSTEMI: s/p VF arrest successfully resuscitated. Patient with
severe 3VD. Had DES placed to SVG to RCA. Patient treated for
NSTEMI with increase in outpatient statin medication. CK peaked
at 341 and TnT peaked 1.14 on [**3-1**]. Patient had cardiac echo
which demosntrated severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall
consistent with RCA infarct. Patient started on [**Month/Year (2) 4532**] and
continued on high dose aspirin. Patient treated beta blocker in
house. Lipid profile checked on admission demonstrated Cholest
119, Triglyc 124, HDL 33, LDLcalc 61. HgA1c pending on
discharge.  Patient on telemetry with some ectopy post NSTEMI
which improved. Patient initially on nitro drip for blood
pressure control which was weaned off after 24 hours post event.
