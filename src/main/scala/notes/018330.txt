Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
67 year-old man, patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3314**], with known CAD

referred for cardiac catheterization due to worsening symptoms.



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the left internal
    mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery,
    and reverse saphenous vein graft to the distal right
    coronary artery and the circumflex artery.
2.  Modified Maze procedure using the cryoablation with
    Resection of Left Atrial Appendage.
3.  Endoscopic greater saphenous vein harvest of the left
    leg.
4.  EpiAortic Duplex Scan


History of Present Illness:
This 67 year old man has a history of difficult to control
hypertension, CAD and COPD here with chest discomfort. Over the
past two to three months the patient has noticed a lot of chest
discomfort, described as indigestion. It can occur up to
four times a day and then not occur for an entire day. It has
not
seemed to correlate with food or activity and has responded to
both rest and SL nitroglycerin. He denied any associated
symptoms, no n/v, no diaphoresis, no ligtheadedness, never
syncopized, no palpitation.s He has not undergone any recent
stress testing and is now referred for cardiac catheterization
to evaluate for a progression of his CAD.
In [**2171-6-18**] the patient underwent cardiac and renal
angiography at [**Hospital1 18**]. No significant renal artery stenosis was
noted, although he did have coronary artery disease. The LMCA
had a 60% distal eccentric lesion. The LAD had only mild diffuse
disease. The RCA had a 70% mid stenosis and a focal 80% ostial
PDA. There was moderately elevated right and left heart filling
pressures with moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
.
Most recent testing:
[**2173-4-14**] ETT: 3 minutes 30 seconds Modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, 98%
max PHR, stopping due SOB. No chest pain. Imaging: no ischemia
or
MI. LVEF 51%.
.
ROS: Denies orthopnea, PND
+ Intermittent LE edema (wears compression stockings)
+ Occasional palpitations, unrelated to activity
+ Frequent lightheadedness associated with bending down or
climbing stairs
+ Bilateral calf cramping with walking one mile

Social History:
Patient lives with his significant other [**Name (NI) 1258**]
[**Name (NI) 52326**]; Patient previously smoked 3 packs a day. He quit in
[**2154**]

Sister s/p CABG at age 57. Brother with CAD in
his 50's


Physical Exam:
AVSS
AAOX3 NAD
RRR
CTAB
S/NT/ND
Warm no edema

Pertinent Results:
[**2175-1-12**] CXR: PORTABLE AP CHEST (TWO VIEWS): There is a
left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium
and right ventricle. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal
contours are normal. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
.
[**2175-1-12**] Cath: 60% LM disease, 70% RCA, 80%RPDA (all are old and
stable) and then a new 90% LAD lesion
.
[**2175-1-12**] Carotid u/s: IMPRESSION:
1. 80-99% left ICA stenosis.
2. Widely patent right common and internal carotid arteries in
this patient who is apparently status post right carotid
endarterectomy.
.
[**2175-1-12**] ECHO:
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-27**]
mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
 Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the interventricular septum.
 Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal.
 There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**2175-1-13**] Stent to carotid artery: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical left internal carotid artery stenosis.
2. Successful angioplasty and stenting of the left internal
carotid
artery using a 6.0/8.0x30mm Acculink self expanding stent.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] 67 year-old man with worsening chest pain and known CAD
who was
referred for cardiac catheterization. He was found to have LM
(60%), RCA (70%) RPDA 80%, (these are old) and new LAD (90%)
lesion. No intervention was performed and he was evaluated for
CABG.
.
# cardiac:
ISCHEMIA: patient was found to have 3 vessel disease during cath
and no intervention was done. He was worked up for CABG. During
this work up, his right internal carotid artery was found to be
80-99% stenosed although he was asymptomatic.  He was taken back
to the cath lab and had successful carotid artery stenting done
in preparation for CABG.  He was evaluated by neurology prior to
stenting procedure.
.
While awaiting CABG, his blood pressure was controlled with his
home medications of metoprolol, valsartan, lisinopril, imdur and
labetolol gtt. His goal range of SBP was 140-160. (His high end
SBP was 200 without labetolol gtt.)  He was continued on aspirin
and plavix and a statin.
.
RHYTHM - Patient is s/p pace maker placement.  Patient has been
in atrial fibrillation with good rate control.  He was
maintained on a heparin gtt and rate controlled with metoprolol
and digoxin (home meds).
.
PUMP - Patient was clinically euvolemic. ECHO showed LVH, with
EF 50%.  His home furosemide was given only on a prn basis.
.
# CRI - Old studies report no history of RAS.  His CRI is likely
secondary to his hypertension (at home he reports running around
SBP 180's).  His baseline Cr is 1.8 and this remained stable.
.
# DM  - he was maintained on his insulin SS and home standing
NPH for diabetes control.  He was also maintained on his
neurontin for neuropathy.
.
# Gout - patient complains of feeling beginnings of gout
symptoms on left foot. No evidence of clinical gout. He takes
colchicine at home to help and was given a dose of colchicine
.
# ppx - bowel reg, heparin gtt, H2blocker
.
# Full code

Cardiac Surgery Discharge summery

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2175-1-16**] where he
under wwent:

1.  Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the left internal
    mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery,
    and reverse saphenous vein graft to the distal right
    coronary artery and the circumflex artery.
2.  Modified Maze procedure using the cryoablation with
    Resection of Left Atrial Appendage.
3.  Endoscopic greater saphenous vein harvest of the left
    leg.
4.  EpiAortic Duplex Scan

Postopeerativly he was admitted to the ICU. His post operative
course was complicated by acute reanl failure and RV
dsyfunction.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on POD1 where
the acute marginal artery was found to be occluded.  He
underwent successful balloon angioplasty of this vessel and
placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.  Post-procedure the
patient remained intubated and was receiving BP support. While
in the ICU the patient was in acute renal failure and received
several days of CVVHD his maximum creatineane was 3.8 the pt was
also placed of enteral feeding while in the ICU.  Eventualy the
pt was weaned of pressors and of the vent and successfully
extubated.  The patient also had reatun of renal function and
was able to be weaned off dialysis.  The patients post operative
course was complicated by a fib for which he received amioderone
and beta blocker therapy. At the time of discharge the patient
had good pain control on po pain medications.  He was in normal
sinus rhythm and on an an amoiderone taper.  H
