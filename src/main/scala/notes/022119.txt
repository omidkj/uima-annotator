History of Present Illness:
SIRS SUB-I ADMIT NOTE
.
CC: Admit for N/V, weakness
Transfer to MICU for hypotension, tachycardia
Transfer to floor after stabilization for necrotic cholecystitis
.
HPI: 62 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, hyperlipidemia, CHF, DM1,
presented to OSH with feeling weak, N/V, poor PO intake and
abdominal pain since Sunday. Pt started to feel ill on Sunday
after eating chinese food with abdominal cramping. No diarrhea
but N/V and poor PO intake. Pt with increasing abdominal pain,
feeling weak with subjective fevers at home-no temp taken. Pt
denied any CP or difficulty breathing, has occasional orthopnea
and PND, baseline LE edema-chronic. He continued taking his home
BP meds, including an ACE-I and diuretics despite poor PO
intake. He has had occasional palpitations and possible prior AF
subsequent to his CABG but not recently. He was also c/o
lightheadedness and dizziness. Denied cough, dysuria, no
hematuria, no BRBPR, No hematochezia.
.
3 weeks prior to admission family with viral illness-no abx
given. However 1 week ago was dx with sinusitis infection per
PCP and was treated w/10day course of an abx, pt unclear which
abx he was given. No recent travel.
.
OSH COURSE: Pt found to be in AF w/RVR, bp 82/48-->102/47 prior
to transfer, BNP & CE pending, CXR w/?PNA, received moxifloxacin
400mg IV x1 for ?PNA, Hep gtt w/bolus for new onset AF, no nodal
agents given, 250cc IVF bolus x1, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.
.
ED COURSE [**Hospital1 18**]: Initial BP 107/68, HR 110, CXR done, 2mg
morphine IV x1 for abdominal pain, 250cc IVF given. Admit for
further managment and evaluation of PNA. Pt received no further
antibiotics and further workup for abdominal pain. No cultures
were drawn despite a WBC of 20,000.
.
On the floor, pt SBP 95-85 with HR 120-130. Pt was found to have
abdominal pain with positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign. Pt was started on
Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl and received one dose each.
US was done and findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
The gallbladder contains small stones and sludge. Surgery was
consulted and was concerned for nectrotic gallbladder. However,
given poor operative candidate, percutaneous cholecystostomy was
recommended. The pt received about 1.5L of NS and Diltiazem was
pushed x2 with intermittent effect on the patient's HR. The
patient was changed to Vanco and Zosyn for antibiotic coverage.
Cultures were drawn. He is now transferred to the MICU due to
hypotension and tachycardia for further management.
.
MICU COURSE:
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is in place, drained ~700cc
bilious fluid. The patient converted from NSR to AFIB despite
Digoxin 0.25IV x1, lopressor 5mg IV x2, dilt 10mg IV x1, dig
0.125mg PO x1 today. There was a small amount of blood in the
cholecystostomy drain tube, but per IR, this small blood is to
be expected. Upon transfer from the MICU, BP 120s, HR 100s,
92%RA, no respiratory distress. Surgery recommended that since
the patient was improving, to continue vanc/zosyn. [**Last Name (un) **]
consult recommended to start lantus 6 HS, low dose HISS. Wound
care consult saw patient for chronic venous stasis ulcers and
recommended dressing changes. On the floor, he is comfortable,
eating, and states that he wants to go home.

TTE:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation is seen on the tricuspid valve. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function.
Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertertension.

CT abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right-sided pigtail catheter terminating within the
gallbladder lumen in appropriate position. Hyperdense material
within the gallbladder lumen likely represents contrast material
from prior study. Correlation with history recommended. Markedly
thickened gallbladder wall.
2. Extensive bibasilar atelectasis and tiny pleural effusions.
Findings are slightly greater than what would be expected for
simple atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia could be considered.
3. Splenic calcified cystic lesion likely post-traumatic in
etiology. Splenomegaly.
4. E
