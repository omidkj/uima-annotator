Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2962**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB (transfer from MICU)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M h/o CAD s/p MI, CHF, PAF on coumadin who p/w 1 week of
increasing SOB and BRBPR. He first noticed SOB after being
diagnosed with Erlichiosis in [**1-19**]; these symptoms have
significantly worsened over the last 2 weeks. At baseline, he is
quite functional (walks >1 mile, flight of stairs, 20 [**Date Range **] on
treadmill); however, recently notes DOE after walking 1 block.
No orthopnea, PND, chest pain. Did complain of a nonproductive
cough but no fevers, chills, or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] history of
asthma or COPD and is a lifelong nonsmoker. Has had palpitations
~1x/wk typically in the morning and resolving spontaneously and
was recently diagnosed with new-onset Afib [**4-21**] after presenting
to ED with RVR and chest pain; he was rate-controlled and
started on coumadin. Finally, the evening prior to admission, he
went to the bathroom and had 1 episode of 'beet-colored' stool.
No further bloody bowel movements since. He presented to the ED
due to shortness of breath.
.
In the ED: T 97.0 BP 127/67 HR 72 RR 30 O2 98% RA. EKG NSR w/
nonspecific ST changes anteriorly. Troponin 0.03 likely due to
demand but CKs negative. CXR showed small R sided pleural
effusion but no infiltrate. Labs significant for INR 2.7, Hct 28
(from 32 10 days prior) and guaiac positive on rectal exam. He
received vit K 5 mg sc. Given concern for GI bleeding, the
patient was admitted to the MICU for close monitoring.
.
At presentation to the MICU, the patient was hypertensive
(150s/110s) and in moderate respiratory distress likely from
acute pulmonary edema. He improved with 1 mg morphine, nitro
gtt, and combivent nebs. He was diuresed with lasix and weaned
off supplemental O2 to room air. The patient developed atrial
flutter with RVR that was difficult to rate control with coreg
and dilt. EP was consulted and he was chemically converted to
NSR with ibutilide and was loaded with amiodarone. While in RVR,
he did complain of chest pain but had no cardiac enzyme leak. GI
was consulted due to G+ stool but given that his Hct remained
stable and there was no hemodynamic compromise, colonoscopy was
deferred. Heparin gtt was restarted and he was transferred to
the floor for further management.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse; he occasionally
drinks wine.  He is a retired [**University/College 58526**] English

[**Name (NI) **] Corner soon. Son is an electrician on the [**Last Name (un) 19700**].

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. There is a family history of hypothryoidism.


Physical Exam:
T 97.3 RR 20 SpO2 96% on RA. Blood pressure was 122/60 mm Hg
while seated.  Pulse was 74 beats/[**Last Name (un) **] and regular, respiratory
rate was *** breaths/[**Last Name (un) **]. Generally the patient was well
developed, well nourished and well groomed. The patient was
oriented to person, place and time. The patient's mood and
affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was supple with
JVP of 8 cm.  The carotid waveform was normal.  There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis.  The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs revealed rales at the left
base but were otherwise clear to ascultation bilaterally with
normal breath sounds and no rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line.  There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4.  The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, or
clubbing; there was 1+ bilateral LE edema present. There were no
abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or
palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis
dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Discharge labs:

.
MICRO: Blood cultures 7/23,[**6-7**] no growth
.
EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with PVCs/PACs, normal axis, <1mm
lateral ST depressions.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2118-6-7**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size.  There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
without aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (EF 35%). Moderate mitral regurgitation. Borderline
elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
.
ETT performed on [**7-20**] demonstrated:
10 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] protocol. Stopped d/t fatigue. Hemodynamic response
blunted in setting of beta blockade. No ischemic symptoms. At
peak exercise, 1.5-2 mm downsloping ST segment depressions in
inferolateral leads. Absent by 5 minutes of recovery.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2-/2102**] demonstrated:
Occluded LAD w/ bridging collaterals distally from prox LAD and
acute marginal, 90% D
