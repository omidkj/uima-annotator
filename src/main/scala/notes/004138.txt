Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Found unresponsive, cardiac arrest (PEA)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation [**2173-3-30**]
2. Mechanical ventilation
3. Central line
4. Femoral arterial line

History of Present Illness:
88 year old woman with dementia (A&OX2), congestive heart
failure (EF50%), coronary artery disease with stent to RCA and
otherwise three-vessel disease, mild-moderate MR/AR, complete
heart block s/p pacemaker, h/o UTI with MDR E. Coli, recent
admission for NSTEMI (2/8-9/[**2173**]), who was in her usual state of
health until found unresponsive this morning at her nursing home
([**Hospital3 537**]), at 7am. Per the patient's family, she had "not
been feeling well" the day prior and had been complaining of
left thigh pain.
.
When EMS arrived at the Nursing Home, patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma
Score of 3. She was intubated. Patient reportedly had
spontaneous movements and faint carotid pulse en route to the
hospital.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, the patient became pulseless upon
transfer from stretcher to bed. The initial rhythm was PEA.
Chest compressions were started and 1 mg of epinephrine given.
Patient had return of spontaneous circulation, although [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
pressures were systolic 50-60. RIJ central line was placed and
levophed gtt started. Patient was bolused 1L normal saline.
Patient's [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pressure remained labile, from 50-60 to 140s
intermittently over a course of 20 minutes before pulse was lost
again, with the rhythm being PEA. Patient received an additional
1 mg of Epinephrine. Femoral arterial line was placed. Her pulse
returned and her [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pressures have been systolic 130s since.
She was started on phenylephrine as well as the levophed gtt
after the second PEA arrest.
.
Stat labs returned with Lactate 13.7 and Hct initially 18
(baseline from [**3-24**] was 30), troponin 0.54. Given the
hematocrit, patient had FAST done at bedside which was negative,
guaiac positive (brown stool), received 2 units of uncrossed
pRBC. She received 2mg Versed for sedation but was not started
on a drip. Also empirically given Vancomycin/Zosyn.
.
The patient was sent for CT head and torso. The CT torso showed
a left sided retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of PTT of 150
(possibly secondary to heparin flushes for her PICC line). The
patient received 50mg IV protamine to reverse the PTT prior to
transfer to CCU. Also had received a total of 2.5L normal saline
IV. Surgery evaluated patient briefly in the ED following RP
bleed seen on CT and did not recommended operative therapy. Upon
transfer, patient HR78, BP164/64, vent settings (Assist Control,
FiO2100%, RR 28, TV 450) but satting 100%.
.
On review of systems, patient intubated/sedated and unable to
provide history.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2173-3-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube ending 3.1 cm above the carina.
2. No acute radiographic cardiac or pulmonary process.
.
CTA TORSO [**2173-3-30**]:
1. Large left retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the left
hemidiaphragm into the left pelvis. No areas of active
extravasation are identified, although this study was not
optimized for evaluation of the distal aorta and iliac vessels.
Given the patient's history of recent heparinization, this
hematoma could be consistent with a spontaneous retroperitoneal
hemorrhage.
2. Nonspecific peripancreatic fat stranding could be due to
third spacing or pancreatic trauma. Recommend clinical
correlation.
3. Transverse lucency through part of the superior aspect of the
L3 vertebral body could represent a fracture of uncertain
chronicity. Recomme
