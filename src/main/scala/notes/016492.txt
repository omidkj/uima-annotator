HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old woman
with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma which
was diagnosed in [**2153-5-3**] (who is status post 3 courses of
high-dose methotrexate both intravenously and intrathecally; the
last of which was 2 weeks prior to admission), who is here now
for her fourth course of high-dose methotrexate.

The patient recently had a Ommaya shunt placed during an
admission from [**2153-6-7**] through [**2153-6-12**], but the ventricular
reservoir did not work, and she received her scheduled
intrathecal methotrexate via a lumbar puncture thereafter.

negative for fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, change in mental status, appetite changes, or
seizures.  Positive for mom[**Name (NI) 12823**] chest pain, palpitations,
orthopnea (3 pillows and stable), and was positive as
well for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for
1.  Primary central nervous system lymphoma; she was diagnosed on
[**2153-5-15**] after presenting with tonic-clonic seizure.
(a)  She was started on high-dose intravenous methotrexate on
[**2153-5-25**].
(b)  She is status post left craniotomy on [**2153-5-17**] with a
subgaleal hematoma.
(c)  She has undergone 2 cycles of high-dose methotrexate as well
as intrathecal methotrexate.
2.  The patient has a history of hypertension as well as atrial
fibrillation and was noted to have a troponin leak during her
postoperative stay in the Neurologic Intensive Care Unit in [**2153-5-3**].
3.  Asthma.
4.  Status post left knee surgery.
5.  Left eye retinal detachment; status post laser surgery.
6.  History of zoster with post herpetic neuralgia and a left
T4 dermatome.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

2.  Phenytoin 100 mg by mouth three times per day
3.  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
5.  Epogen 40,000 units subcutaneously (on Sunday).
6.  Decadron 4 mg by mouth twice per day.
7.  Serevent inhaler.
8.  Albuterol inhaler.
9.  Glucosamine chondroitin by mouth every day.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa (gives her nausea, vomiting, chills, and a flu-
like syndrome).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She has four sons
and two daughters.  She reports no history of tobacco or
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on
admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.2 degrees
Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 156/79, heart rate was 80,
respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room
air.  In general, the patient was found lying in bed in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed a well-healed surgical scar present on her left scapula
with some granulation.  Neck examination revealed no jugular
venous distention.  No bruits.  No lymphadenopathy.  Chest
examination revealed scattered crackles.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with some ectopy.
Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and non-distended.  Bowel sounds times 4.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Neurologic examination evaluated the patient was awake and
oriented times three.  Examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed sodium was 139, potassium was 4,
chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was
10, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 82.
Prothrombin time was 15 and partial thromboplastin time was
33.  White blood cell count was 5.8, hematocrit was 30.8, and
platelets were 244.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient received
high-dose methotrexate per protocol.  Methotrexate levels
were followed.  Her methotrexate levels were 3.55 on [**2153-7-11**],
and 0.27 on [**2153-7-12**], and 0.1 on [**2153-7-13**], and 0.05 on [**2153-7-14**].
Her urine was alkalized with bicarbonate and urine pH was checked
regularly and noted to be 7 and above.

A neurosurgery consultation was obtained for correction of her
Ommaya reservoir as prior imaging demonstrated the catheter tip
incorrectly located in the left basal ganglia.  The patient
underwent correction of her shunt on Friday, [**2153-7-13**].

Her postoperative course was complicated by a retro-orbital
hematoma.  A computed tomography of the head demonstrated a soft
tissue density displacing the superior rectus and optic nerve
inferiorly and causing proptosis as well as multisinus disease. A
follow-up magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated the new
left-sided extraconal mass at the superior portion of the left
orbit; consistent with acute hematoma as well as enhancing
meningeal disease in the left frontal lobe with no evidence of
hydrocephalus.

An ophthalmology consultation was obtained and felt all of the
patient's changes in vision and examination were consistent with
post surgical hematoma.  There was no evidence of compartment
syndrome.  Her vision did not worsen during the remainder of her
hospital course.

A Radiation Oncology consultation was obtained and evaluated the
patient.  They also felt that the patient's proptosis and visual
changes were all most likely secondary to a hematoma rather a
neoplastic process.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have
a fever with intermittent spikes in temperature to as high as
101.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  It lasted only several hours.  The
fevers began on Friday ([**2153-7-13**]) and continued through Sunday
([**2153-7-15**]).  All cultures remained negative.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was continued on her
regimen of metoprolol and was not given anticoagulation given
her neurosurgery during admission.

4.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her
outpatient regimen of Serevent and albuterol inhalers.

5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient took oral
intake as tolerated, and electrolytes were repleted as required.

6. GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:  The patient had new onset of
incontinence following her neurosurgical procedure.  The cause of
this new onset of incontinence was not clear; however, the
incontinence was transient and resolved prior to discharge.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Primary central nervous system lymphoma.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Pantoprazole 50 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Phenytoin 100 mg by mouth three times per day
3.  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
5.  Epogen 40,000 units subcutaneously (on Sunday).
6.  Decadron 4 mg by mouth twice per day.
7.  Serevent inhaler.
8.  Albuterol inhaler.
9.  Glucosamine chondroitin by mouth every day.
