Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
85 M with history of DVT, recent large UGIB from bleeding
duodenal ulcer s/p ex lap one month ago; now admit with
pulmonary embolism, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Patient with
recent admission to surgical service for large UGIB related to
duodenal ulcer.  Had ex lap with duodenotomy and oversewing of
ulcer on [**2101-1-16**].  Received 10 units PRBCs, 4 FFP, 1 bag
platelets.  Discharged to rehab on [**1-21**].  Continued to get TPN
via PICC (?still on).
.
In the ED, initial vs were hypoxic, hypotensive, tachycardic.
HR up to 190 with poor pulses and thus cardioverted (x2 total,
synchronized).  Neo and 4L IVFs for hypotension.  L femoral line
placed.  Intubated.  Vanco and ceftaz for antibiotics.  CTA with
lingular PE.  Heparin gtt started.  No TPA due to recent surgery
and large bleed.  CT abd/pelvis without acute pathology.  Other
ED meds: midaz, fent, verapamil.  After intubation pt was
dysynchronous with the vent, became tachy to 170 and dropped
pressures to 40 and they paralyzed him with vec temporarily.

[**2-19**] CTA CHEST
1. Acute pulmonary embolism involving the lingular branch of the
left
pulmonary artery and subsegmental right basilar artery. No CT
findings to
suggest RV strain.

2. Multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.

3. No acute intra-abdominal pathology. Moderate fecal load
present within
the rectum and sigmoid colon.

4. Small bowel containing right inguinal hernia.

[**2-19**] ECHO
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
function is at least mildly depressed. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Very limited study.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 85M with dementia, history of DVT, admitted with
lingular PE and septic shock secondary to multifocal pneumonia.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: Pt did not have overt signs of right-sided
heart strain on presentation and given his co-presentation with
sepsis likely due to pneumonia the pt was not treated with
thrombolytics.  Pt was placed on a heparin gtt until [**2-20**] when he
was made CMO.
.
# Sepsis: Pt presented with septic shock likely secondary to
multifocal pneumonia.  Pt was treated with vancomycin and zosyn
given that he lives at [**Hospital1 100**] MACU.  Pt required Levophed and
Neosynephrine as well as IVF for resuscitation.  Pressors were
withdrawn on [**2-20**] when the pt was made CMO.
.
# Respiratory failure: Likely combination of pulmonary embolism
as well as multifocal pneumonia.  Pt was placed on heparin gtt
and vancomycin/zosyn respectively.  Pt was kept on mechanical
ventilation (required intermittent vecuronium for ventilator
dyssynchrony) until terminally extubated on [**2-20**].
.
# Acute renal failure: Likely combination of prerenal/ATN in the
setting of septic shock.  Pt was resuscitated with IVF PRN.
.
# FEN: Pt was NPO on the ventilator, fluids boluses PRN and
electrolytes repleted as
