IDENTIFYING DATA:  Mr. [**Known lastname 103812**] is a 54-year-old male
transferred out of the intensive care unit status post delirium
tremens and left lower lobe pneumonia status post intubation for
airway protection, now extubated completing a course of
antibiotics for pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 103812**] is a 54-year-old
male with a history of bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse,
hypertension, and hypothyroidism who was admitted to the
[**Hospital3 8063**] for manic symptoms, disorganized behavior,
and aggressiveness.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation of mental status
changes, delirium, chest pain/shortness of breath on [**2189-4-29**],
two days after presentation to [**Hospital1 **].  The patient was
admitted to the medical floor.  He had received
ceftriaxone/acyclovir for concern for meningitis/encephalitis.
The patient had ruled out for myocardial infarction on admission
and had been initiated on CIWA scale.

The patient was determined to be in active delirium tremens while
on the medical floor and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for frequent
sedation requirements and a level of nursing care that could not
be provided on the medical floor.  The patient had received
Ativan at 2 mg q. one hour plus additional 6 mg of Ativan and
Valium 10 mg pushes x 3 with persistent agitation, tachycardia,
and hypertension.  He was initiated on an Ativan drip, was
titrated up to 10 mg per hour for persistent agitation which led
to respiratory depression and Ativan was subsequently
discontinued.  The patient was started on BiPAP and this was
quickly titrated off as the benzodiazepines had worn off.  He
continued to be agitated with increased blood pressures and
tachycardia and the Ativan was changed to Valium per CIWA scale.
Of note, the patient had spiked a temperature to 101.8 degrees on
[**2189-5-3**] and he was pancultured and a chest x-ray was performed.
The patient's sputum had Gram-positive cocci in pairs and
clusters and he was initiated on Levaquin therapy for a
tracheobronchitis.  On [**2189-5-4**] the patient had persistent thick
secretions requiring frequent suction, and he had a large liquid
stool which was tested for C. difficile as a cause for his
fevers.  This culture returned negative for C. difficile.  The
patient was also noted to have decreasing urine output requiring
several fluid boluses.  The psychiatrist who had been following
this patient since admission recommended a quick taper with
Valium secondary to his increased sedation at that time.  Haldol
was given for agitation and the patient's QTC was followed
closely.  On [**2189-5-5**] the patient's CIWA scale was discontinued
and Haldol was used preferentially for agitation.  The sputum
returned with speciation of Staphylococcus aureus and his
levofloxacin was changed to vancomycin on this date until the
sensitivities returned.  He had been transiently started on tube
feeds which were subsequently held secondary to agitation.  As
the sensitivities from his sputum culture returned on [**2189-5-7**] as
oxacillin sensitive, his antibiotics were change to oxacillin at
that time.  The patient also had received approximately 30 mg of
Haldol for agitation and his O2 requirement subsequently
increased over this day which led to his intubation on [**2189-5-8**]
for respiratory distress and airway protection.  He remained on a
propofol drip for sedation while he was intubated.  Repeat head
CT and EEG were performed for his persistent mental status
changes.  The CT scan of his head was negative and his EEG
ultimately returned with results consistent with encephalopathy.
The patient was successfully extubated on [**2189-5-11**] without
difficulty.  His mental status continued to improve and his
oxacillin was subsequently changed to levofloxacin on [**2189-5-13**].
The patient completed a 10-day course of antibiotics on [**2189-5-14**]
prior to transfer to the medical floor.

Of note, the patient was found to have significant liver function
test abnormalities on admission with an ALT of 383, AST 615,
alkaline phosphatase of 206, total bilirubin of 0.7 with normal
pancreatic enzymes.  This was felt to be consistent with
alcoholic hepatitis, with the transaminases significantly
decreased to within normal limits prior to his transfer.
Hepatitis serologies were checked and were determined to be
negative.

Mr. [**Known lastname 103812**] had received a total of 275 mg of Valium while
admitted and has not required any Haldol since [**2189-5-10**].
Currently the patient is not agitated and he denies any current
complaints.
