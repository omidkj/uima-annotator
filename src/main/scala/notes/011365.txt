Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with pancreatic duct stricture and chronic abdominal
pain was admitted to the HPB Surgical Service for elective
Puestow procedure. On [**2184-10-7**], the patient underwent
longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow procedure),
extensive lysis of adhesions and intraoperative ultrasound,
which went well without complication (reader referred to the
Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in
the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and
antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter with
Dilaudid PCA for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically
stable.
Neuro: The patient has a history of chronic pain and uses
opioids for last ten years. Post op pain was controlled with
Bupivacaine via epidural and Dilaudid PCA. His epidural was
replaced by APS on POD # 1 for better coverage. Chronic pain
service was consulted. The epidural was discontinued on POD # 3
and PCA was discontinued on POD # 4. The patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications with IV Dilaudid for
breakthrough pain. IV Dilaudid was weaned off on POD # 5, and
oral medication was titrated to achieve good pain control with
help of the CPS. Prior discharge patient was given an adequate
amount of long and short acting medication to control his pain.
The patient was explained, that HPB Surgery will prescribe his
medication only for post operative period, and if patient will
require long acting Oxycontin, he will have to see his PCP to
refill prescriptions.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated.
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid
was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely
followed, and repleted when necessary. JP amylase was removed on
POD # 6 as amylase level and output were low.
GU: The foley catheter was discontinued at midnight of POD# 3.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Wound was evaluated
daily knowing patient history of wound infection post prior
operations. Wound erythema was noticed on POD # 4 and was
watched carefully. The erythema subsided without any treatment,
no antibiotics were indicated.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; he was restarted on his home regiment prior discharge.
FS were within normal limits.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diabetic diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain
was relatively well controlled.  The patient received discharge
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
