IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema and
bilateral pleural effusions. Opacity at the right lung base may
represent pneumonia versus atelectasis.

ECG Study Date of [**2157-3-23**]  2:14:20 AM
NOTE: patient on digoxin
Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V delay. Left atrial abnormality.
Modest
non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Probable
infero-posterior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific but cannot
exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested for possible
right ventricular overload. Since the previous tracing of
[**2157-1-29**] ST-T wave changes appear more prominent

ECG Study Date of [**2157-3-24**]  10:50:40 AM
Sinus rhythm Right axis deviation Inferolateral/posterior
myocardial infarct  Since previous tracing, no significant
change

ECHO Study Date of [**2157-3-29**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. There  is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is  mildly dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection  fraction [**11-4**]
percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free  wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch  is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but  aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation  is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.  Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2157-1-20**], the left ventricular
ejection fraction is further reduced.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2157-4-1**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
syetm with
severe three vessel disease. RCA stents were patent but the
distal vessel and the R-PDA were diffusely severely diseased.
The LMCA was totally occluded as were the proximal LCX and the
LAD. LIMA to the LAD graft was patent but did not backfill the
LCX. SVG grafts were know occluded and were not engaged.
2. Left vetriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed markedly elevated left and
right sided
filling pressures (PCWP 29 mm Hg and RAp 34 mm Hg) consistent
with severe volume overload. RA pressure tracing and LVEDP
tracing had accentuated X and Y descents and square root sign
configuration consistent with interventricular interdependence
due to volume overload. Cardiac index was 2.0.
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the LMCA and the LCX with
two 2.5 mm Cypher drug-eluting stents, proximally post-dilated
to 3.0 mm. 5.  The right CFA arteriotomy site was closed with a
6 French Angioseal.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary this is a 57 year old man with HTN, DM
hyperlipidemia, CAD, CHF, ESRD on anticoagulation who presents
to ED w/ epistaxis x 12 hours.

Following transfer to the floor, the pt appeared volume
overloaded on CXR. He subsequently [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] HD on [**3-23**] and had
2 kg ultrafiltration. During the next few days, the pt had
several intermittent episodes of chest pain with EKGs showing
deepened ST depression anterolaterally with peak troponins of
0.38 and CKs in 30s. The ST changes persisted even after
resolution of the CP (relieved with metoprolol).  He again
received HD on [**3-24**] and [**3-26**] with 2L ultrafiltrated both
times. The medicine team contact[**Name (NI) **] the pt's outpatient
cardiologist who stated that pt's last cath was in [**6-19**] at
[**Hospital1 18**]. He had not had a cath at [**Hospital1 2025**] as was erronously stated in
a prior discharge summary. The pt's outpt cardiologist agreed
with continuing ASA and coumadin and discontinuing plavix since
the taxol stent was placed over 19 months ago. The pt was also
re-started on a statin. Given the episodes of chest pain with
unclear etiology and EKG changes, the plan was made to proceed
with P-MIBI on [**3-29**]. In further events, the pt was transfused 2
units of PRBCs over the hospital course for a goal Hct of 30
given concern for demand ischemia.
.
On [**3-28**], the pt [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] HD during which he had 2 L
untrafiltrated. He tolerated this well but did receive 0.5 mg of
IV ativan for anxiety. Following arrival back on the floor, the
pt was found to be hypotensive at 78/doppler and was more
lethargic
