Chief Complaint:
cough, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, central line, arterial line

History of Present Illness:
61 yo F with PMH of asthma (no prior intubations), OSA (does not
wear CPAP), HTN, and depression who p/w shortness of breath,
fevers and chills. She suddenly developed acute onset of
shortness of breath and sharp chest pain lasting seconds this
afternoon. Has also noted that her legs have been getting more
swollen recently, denies calf pain. Also had n/v x2,
nonbloody/nonbilious and diarrhea x5 today, no abdominal pain.
.
In ED, Tmax 101.6, RR 24-40, satting 89%RA -> 93-97% on 3L. RR
decreased. On exam, pt with audible crackles and wheezing
throughout lung fields. CXR with LLL pneumonia. Her lab showed
lactate of 3.4, and she received 1L NS bolus. Despite the fluid,
she became more hypotensive with SBP ~80-90s. L subclavian line
was placed and she was started on levophed. She received total
of 4.5 L NS in the ED. Per report, her breathing became more
labored and she was intubated. Also received tylenol,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is intubated and sedated. Unable
to get further history. Attempted to call her husband and left a

IMAGING:
[**2140-11-17**] CXR: The heart size is normal. There is a left basilar
opacity and retrocardiac density, concerning for lower lobe
pneumonia or effusion. Linear opacities at the right base likely
reflect atelectasis. The remaining areas of the lungs are clear.
The central pulmonary vessels are prominent. There is no
pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. The left costophrenic
angle is excluded from the study.
.
[**2140-11-19**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The patient is
mechanically ventilated. The IVC is small, consistent with an RA
pressure of <10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded, although there is the suggestion of
possible basal inferior hypokinesis in some views. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Suggestion of possible basal
inferior hypokinesis in some views, however due to the limited
image quality and patient inability to cooperate while intubated
this cannot be definitively diagnosed. No clinically significant
valvular disease. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic
pressure. Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2134-1-4**], mild mitral regurgitation
is no longer present. The suggestion of possible basal inferior
hypokinesis was not mentioned previously, but suboptimal image
quality was also noted on the prior study and thus may have been
present, but not identified.
.
[**2140-11-21**] CXR: Compared with [**2140-11-20**] at 5:29 a.m. and allowing for
technical differences, there may have been slight improvement in
the degree of opacity in the left mid-zone. Otherwise, no
significant change is detected. Left subclavian central line tip
over mid SVC again noted. Again seen are prominent opacities in
the left mid and lower zone, with retrocardiac air bronchograms
and obscuration of the left costophrenic angle and left
hemidiaphragm. Probable small left effusion. There is also some
patchy perihilar opacity on the right and minimal blunting of
the right costophrenic angle. Doubt CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old woman with a history of asthma and OSA who presented
with fevers and SOB secondary to LLL pneumonia complicated by
septic shock requiring pressors and intubation.
.
# Septic shock: Pt developed hypotension in the ED that was
unresponsive to fluids and was thus started on levophed. Lactate
was initially 3.4 which resolved with fluids. Likely source was
her LLL pneumonia and she was empirically started on
azithro/ceftriaxone/vanco. Urine legionella neg, blood cultures
no growth to date, urine culture negative, sputum culture x2
without growth. On hospital day #2 ([**11-20**]) she was weaned of
levophed.
.
# Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: Pt found to have LLL pneumonia
which was treated empirically with vanco/azithro/ceftriaxone
(day 1 = [**11-19**]). Sputum cultures x2 w/o growth. TTE showed no RV
strain and preserved EF, making PE less likely. She was
successfully extubated on [**11-20**] and currently has O2 sats in the
mid-90s on 5L nasal cannula, though does desat to the mid-upper
80s with movement. Vancomycin was discontinued on [**11-21**] and she
was transitioned to oral levofloxacin for completion of an
antibiotic course for community-acquired pneumonia.  A tot
