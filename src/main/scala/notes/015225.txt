History of Present Illness:
This 66 year old black with a complicated medical history was
initially evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**2129-3-21**] at which time
cardiac catheterization revealed severe two vessel disease. She
was in rehabilitation at the time and very deconditioned. It was
decided to optimize medical management. She susequently returned
following discharge from rehab, reporting improved strength. She
is walking with a walker, and experiences dyspnea on exertion,
but as had no further chest pain. She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] last
week, who believes the patient is ready for surgery now.

Pertinent Results:
[**2129-7-27**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**Known firstname 1743**] [**Known lastname **] before surgical incision
POST-BYPASS: Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF
55%. Intact thoracic aorta. Rest of the findings similar to
prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing all pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**7-27**] she was brought to the
Operating Room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 3. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. She was extubated on post-op day
2. Beta-blockers and diuretics were initiated and she was
diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol.

Nephrology was consulted on post-op day four for acute on
chronic renal failure (diuretics were discontinued) as the
creatinine rose from 1.5 baseline to 3.1.  She was followed by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] (nephrology). She remained in the CVICU until
post-op day six when she was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further care.

She developed urinary tract infection symptoms which were
treated with Cipro. Appointments were scheduled for cardiology,
renal, and cardiac surgery after discharge. The creatinine on
the day of discharge was stable at 2.9. It is felt that this
will improve somewhat over time.  She was cleared for discharge
to rehab on POD #8. She will have twice weekly labs drawn to
follow her renal insufficiency.

Glucose has been under good control and finger sticks have
required rare coverage with sliding scale Humalog insulin.  If
her glucose were to become frequently elevated above 140 as her
intake improves, sliding scale coverage would be indicated.

Wounds were clean and healing well at discharge.  She remained
about 4 kilograms above her preoperative weight, but diuretics
have been on hold due to her renal dysfunction.  She has had
good urine output and weight decreases without treatment.There
remains some peripheral edema that should resolve with increased
activity and autodiuresis.
