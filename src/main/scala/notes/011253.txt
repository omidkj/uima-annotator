History of Present Illness:
42-year-old man with asthma transferred from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital
for further management of respiratory failure. Presented there
with 3 days of progressive nonproductive cough and 1 day of
headache. Cough was not responsive to inhaled albuterol.

in the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED and did not improve with nebulized
bronchodilators. Nasopharyngeal influenza A/B swab was negative.
Given avelox, prednisone 60 mg, magnesium, ativan, stacked
duonebs but quickly deteriorated and was intubated and treated
with paralytics. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. In
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CXR showed mild prominence of the central
vasculature which may suggest fluid overload but no pulmonary
edema, infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax.

CT Chest [**2186-10-24**] -
1)Diffuse tracheobronchial wall thickening with calcification
causing
narrowing of the entire tracheobronchial tree with mucous
plugging in the
lower lobes bilaterally. The appearance is highly suggestive of
relapsing
polychondritis
2)Centrilobular nodules in the left lower lobe suggest recent
infection or
inflammation.
3)No central pulmonary embolism.

ECHO [**2186-10-25**] -
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is probably normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Trachea Pathology [**10-25**] - Respiratory mucosa with focal squamous
metaplasia and marked mixed inflammation with
fibrino-inflammatory exudates.

Brief Hospital Course:
42-year-old man with history of asthma transferred for
management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, believed
secondary to relapsing polychondritis.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Patient had been intubated at
OSH prior to his arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He was admitted to the
ICU where he was treated initially with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and Tamiflu for community-acquired pneumonia and
possible influenza. Additionally, he received bronchodilator
inhalers on standing dose schedules and high dose IV steroids
for question of asthma flare. He underwent influenza DFA testing
that returned negative; urine legionella was also negative.
Lactate trended down from 5 to 2.3. He underwent CTA that did
not show PE although the CTA findings were highly suggestive of
relapsing polychondritis. [**Doctor First Name **], RF, and ANCA were negative. He
underwent bronchoscopy x2 that showed diffuse airway
inflammation; endobronchial biopsies showed focal squamous
metaplasia and marked mixed inflammation with
fibrino-inflammatory exudates, although no calcification (as one
would expect in relapsing polychondritis). On [**10-25**], he
underwent echocardiogram that showed normal left ventricular
systolic function with no valvular disease. On [**10-26**],
antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated on [**10-27**]. He
remained on steroids and was transferred to the floors once his
respiratory status stabilized. He was followed closely by the
rheumatology service with the tentative diagnosis of relapsing
polychondritis.

At time of transfer to the floor, he was satting above 95% on
RA, during rest and exertion. Exam was notable for persistent
diffuse coarse breath sounds with faint expiratory wheezes,
although there was no tachypnea, accessory muscle use, or
respiratory distress. At the recommendation of the rheumatology
service, he was discharged on prednisone at a dose of 30 mg
twice daily. He will follow-up with rheumatology, interventional
pulmonology, and pulmonary clinics.

independent mobility


Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management of your symptoms of cough and shortness of
breath that led to respiratory distress and the need for
intubation.  A CTA scan of your chest and the appearance of your
bronchial tree on bronchoscopy were highly suggestive of a
diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. You were seen by
specialists in pulmonology and rheumatology, who recommend that
you follow up with them as an out-patient.

We have made the following changes to your medication regimen:
- BEGIN TAKING Prednisone 30 mg by mouth twice daily (your
rheumatologist may change this dose at your next appointment)
- BEGIN TAKING Combivent inhaler (use this instead of albuterol
inhaler) 1-2 puffs as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing
- BEGIN T
