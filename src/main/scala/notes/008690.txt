Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with CAD, DMII, dementia presents from nursing home with
acute renal failure, leukocytosis, and hypoactive dementia,
febrile in ED and with UA c/w UTI.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Consistent w/ prerenal azotemia secondary
to decreased PO intake.  Resolved with ivfs.
.
# UTI: Patient presented w/ leukocytosis and fevers.  CT
abdomen/pelvis w/o abcess, but air in bladder likely secondary
to UTI.  Patient started on cipro for treatment of Proteus
mirabilis UTI, but sensitivities showed resistance so changed to
Cefpodoxime which was sensitive to.
.
# Delerium: Secondary to infection (see above).  Improved with
treatment
.
# Hyperglycemia / Diabetes: Likely [**3-6**] infectious process. No
evidence of DKA or HONK. Patient maintained on lantus, moved to
20units from 26U, and a sliding scale.
.
# ST depressions on ECG: Demand ischemia in the setting of
infection with troponin leak. CE trended and did not rise. Have
noted for [**Hospital 100**] rehab to see about putting on beta blockade,
aceihibitor, statin if these have not otherwise been
intentionally omitted.
.
# CHF: Patient monitored clinically while receiving ivfs.  Not
on ACE, though may have been omitted intentionally by rehab.
HAve asked daughter to corroborate with them, and [**Hospital 48630**]
rehab to corroborate with daaughter to determine need to go back
on these.  If no other known contraindications, should be on low
dose beta blocker, ace inhibitor, and a statin as tolerated.
.
# Hypoactive Dementia/Agitation
Per report, not oriented at baseline, now even less responsive
over last two weeks. Was on seroquel and ativan. Seroquel d/c'd
at NH. Ativan held.
.
# GERD
--cont home pepcid
