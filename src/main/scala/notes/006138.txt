History of Present Illness:
69 year old female status motor vehicle accident as the
restrained driver with loss of concoiousness and hitting a
parked car at 40 miles per hour.  Blood glucose at the scene was
28 per EMS.  The patient was treated with a half amp of D50 with
improvement.  No nausea vomiting, chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, or extremity pain.  patient takes
coumadin.

She had taken her normal breakfast and then went to the doctor

1.  Myocardial infarction [**Numeric Identifier 13971**]
2.  Diabetes
3.  Type III monoclonal ammopathy
4.  Hypertension
5.  Congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 20%)
6.  ventricular tachycardia status post ICD

Past surgical history:
-4 vessel Coronary artery bypass graft, PTCA

Social History:
non contributory

Family History:
non contributory

Physical Exam:
General:  No apparent distress
head and neck: pupils equal round and reactive to light.  Neck
supple, trachea midline, no lymphadenopathy
Cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm
Lungs: clear to ausultation bilaterally
Abdomen: soft non tender non distended
Extremities:  good pulses throughout, no edema
neuro: alert and oriented times three.  motor and sensation
grossly intact bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
CTA Chest/abdomen and pelvis [**2125-4-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Bilateral patchy diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent
with failure.
2) Small right pleural effusions and trace left effusion.
3) No evidence of dissection.
4) No free fluid in the abdomen or solid organ injury.

CT head [**2125-4-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Findings consistent with old right parietal lobe infarction

CT c-spine [**2125-4-23**]:
There is no evidence of fracture or abnormal alignment of the
component vertebrae. The vertebral bodies and intervertebral
disc space height are preserved. There are atherosclerotic
changes with calcifications within the region of the common
carotid bifurcations. There is also note of biapical ground
glass opacities within the lungs- apparently, the patient is in
cardiac failure, as you indicated to us by telephone.

ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Resting
regional wall
motion abnormalities include akinesis of the [**Doctor Last Name **] [**1-2**]'s of th LV
sparing the
base and the lateral wall.. These remaining left ventricular
segments are
hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular
systolic function is normal. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There iis an echogenic density in the right
ventricle consistent
with a pacemaker lead. There is no pericardial effusion present.
 Ejection Fraction: 15% to 20%


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical ICU on [**2125-4-23**] for
neurologic and hemodynamic monitoring.  He was kept NPO and was
seen by cardiology.  They recognized that the primary problem
was hypoglycemia, and any shortness of breath that the patient
had was related to IV fluid administration, and they suggested a
gentle diuresis.  He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
the medical team felt that the CHF was attributed to the
resuscitation at the trauma, but also that the patient needed
diabetes teaching, especailly with respect to diet and
nutrition.  ON [**4-25**], the patients volume status had improved
and his heartfailure had also imrovoved.  He was on all of his
home meds.  There was a long session of counseling regarding
diabetes management, was told to check her glucose before
driving and the patients hemodynamic stauts was at its baseline
by [**2125-4-26**].  she was able to be discharged at her baseline
in stable condition

Discharge Instructions:
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet
Fluid Restriction: 1.5L

-Please have INR drawn at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] on Saturday [**4-28**]
-Please snack regularly to avoid episodes of hypoglycemia,
especially if you are going to be driving
-Please decrease your standing morning regular dose to 6units
instead of 8 until you have follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **]

better to be slightly high than to be as low as you were when
you crashed.
