aortic arch distal to left subclavian.  There appeared to be
no dissection or aneurysms. . There was increased in size of

final MR report dated [**2103-7-20**]  The patient did go home after
all these procedures.  Also had a preoperative chest X-ray
done that showed a calcification in the aortic knob and no
acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was admitted to the hospital on [**2103-9-19**] to Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] service where she underwent resection of the
aortic mass and replacement of the aortic arch as well as the
proximal descending aorta with re-implantation of the
cephalic vessels.  The patient also had a flexible
bronchoscopy done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a 20 mm [**Doctor First Name **] Weave graft.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] also assisted Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on the
procedure.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic intensive
care unit in stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine titrated
drip and a Propofol titrated drip.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 57737**] also saw
the patient intraoperatively.

Postop day one, the patient had some [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations,
Cardiology was consulted.  The patient was paced at 87 on the
morning of the 28th with a T-max of 100, blood pressure
108/57, she remained intubated and sedated on a Diltiazem
drip at five.  Insulin drip at 1 unit per hour.
Nitroglycerine drip at 0.25 mcg per kg and a Propofol drip of
35 mg.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  Postop labs:  White count 7.9,
hematocrit 27.2, platelet count 148,000.  PT 13.6, PTT 37.2
with an INR 1.2, sodium 145, K 4.1, chloride 112, bicarb 27,
BUN 16, creatinine 1.0, blood sugar 71.  The patient regular
rate and rhythm of the heart.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.  The patient had 1 plus
peripheral edema.  The patient also had a repeat 12 lead
Electrocardiogram this morning.  Diltiazem was continued.
There was a question of whether or not this was spasm in the
right coronary artery and plans were to try and wean the
ventilator during the day.  Please refer to the cardiology
note.  The patient was also seen by rehabilitation services
and physical therapy.  I would defer further evaluation at
this time.

On postop day two the patient had been extubated.  Swann Ganz
Catheter had been removed.  Diltiazem was off.  The patient
was started on Lopressor, beta-blockade and Lasix diuresis.
Nitroglycerin was weaned off.  Creatinine remained stable at
1.1 as did hematocrit and white blood cell count.  The
patient had bilateral expiratory wheeze and 1 plus peripheral
edema, otherwise the patient was alert and oriented in no
acute distress with unremarkable examination.  The patient
continued diuresis, chest tubes were kept in with plan to try
and wean O2 and hopefully get the patient out to the floor
later in the afternoon.

On postop day three, the patient had been restarted on
Norvasc and Captopril for tighter blood pressure control.
Blood pressure was 143/61 with a heart rate of 63 in sinus
rhythm sating 94 percent on 5 liters nasal cannula.  She was
alert and oriented moving all four extremities.  Her lungs
were clear bilaterally.  Her heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  Incisions were clean, dry and intact.  Chest tubes
were removed.  The patient was transferred out to the floor
to get out of bed and start ambulating with the nurses and
physical therapist. . The patient was transferred out to the
floor on postop day three in the afternoon where she was
again re-evaluated and started to work with physical therapy
on ambulation.  The patient continued to be followed by daily
by Vascular Surgery service for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and also seen
by Case Management.  The patient did have some desaturation
with activity to the 80 on postop day five, she remained in
sinus rhythm at 60 with a blood pressure of 110/60, sating 89
percent on four liters.  The patient had decreased breath
sounds bilaterally at the basis but her examination was
otherwise unremarkable.  Central venous line pacing wires had
been removed.  The patient had a pulmonary rehabilitation
screen and had some nebulizers, Norvasc was decreased from
twice a day to once daily dosing.  The patient continued to
work with physical therapy.  Percocet p.o meds were given for
pain.  The patient was repeatedly encouraged to cough, deep
breath and use her incentive spirometer on postop day six.
Hematocrit remained stable at 27.9, sating 92 percent on room
air now  The patient had decreased breath sounds at left base
halfway up.  Sternum was stable.  The left subclavian
incision was also clean and dry.  Repeat chest x-ray was
done.  The Lasix dosing was decreased from twice a day to
once daily.  The patient also continued on her aspirin,
Atenolol, Captopril and Lasix.  The patient was also
receiving Imdur 60 mg p.o. once daily and Methimazole and was
covered by sliding scale regular insulin.

Pulmonology consultation was obtained on [**2103-9-25**].  Diagnosis
of left pleural effusion was made with a question about
whether or not this might need to be performed under
ultrasound guidance, please refer to the consultation note.
The patient was also re-evaluated every day for her
improvement and her ambulation status by case management.
The patient had on postop day seven increasing left effusion,
she had an episode of brief bradycardia with some
hypertension late in the day on [**2103-9-25**].  She had some
complaints of dysuria, her blood pressure was stable.  She
remained in sinus rhythm in the 60's.  Captopril was stopped.
She had the significant decreased breath sounds at her left
lung, otherwise her examination was unremarkable.  Follow-up
urinalysis and chest x-ray were ordered.  The patient had a
thoracentesis of the left chest performed on [**2103-9-26**] by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 57738**].  Approximately one liter of
serosanguineous fluid was removed.  The patient was given
additional Percocet for pain management.  The patient had a
little bit of confusion over the night time confusing about
12 noon versus 12 midnight, this appeared to be resolved
though rapidly.  The patient continued to work with physical
therapy to improve her ambulation status and was doing quite
well and was deemed ready to go home with VNA services on
[**2103-9-27**], postop day 8 and that was the day of discharge.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
