BP of 60 and pinpoint pupils. She received more Narcan with some
response.

Unclear if these were accurate as this was an old list.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, her blood pressure was
initially 100/74, then 80/50, then 50 palpable and then
110/67.  Heart rate was 96, respiratory rate 12, 99% on four
liters nasal cannula.  She is a middle age female, lethargic,
rather unarousible.  Her pupils are pin point, 2.0 millimeter
bilaterally.  Sclera anicteric.  Conjunctiva were clear.  The
oropharynx was clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  She had a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was
protuberant, soft, positive bowel sounds.  She had no edema.
On neurologic examination, she is lethargic and difficult to
assess based on that.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.7, hematocrit
36.8, platelet count 244,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.2,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 27, blood urea nitrogen 15,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 127.  Serum toxicology screen was
negative.  Urine toxicology screen was positive for
benzodiazepines and opiates.

Chest x-ray had a questionable density, a small infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute,
normal axis, low voltage, no acute ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit service.  Gradually mental status improved.
She complained that she was not attempting suicide but rather
wanted control for her back pain.  During hospitalization, her
Medical Intensive Care Unit was complicated by hypotension which
was treated with intravenous fluids.  Cortisol stimulation test
was negative for adrenal insufficiency.  Her pain was treated
successfully with Ibuprofen and Tylenol.  She was therefore
transferred to the floor, placed on [**Last Name (un) **] scale for narcotic
withdrawal to be treated with Clonazepam.  All her narcotics were
held. Psychiatry evaluated her.  She was placed on a Prednisone
taper and inhalers for improvement in respiratory function and
showed marked improvement.  Ionized calcium and PTH were checked
and were normal.  The patient's mental status remained somewhat
diminished.  She was oriented only to name and time.  Her
temperature gradually began to climb and she had minor
electrocardiographic changes.  Therefore, a search began for any
electrolyte disturbance or infection as the cause in change in
mental status.  However, this workup included head CT without
bleed, lumbar puncture negative, and empiric Vancomycin and
Ceftriaxone begun prior to the results of the lumbar puncture
because of concern for meningitis and she was also started on
Acyclovir while HSV PCR was pending. This was subsequently found
to be negative and all antibiotics were stopped.

Late into the hospitalization, the patient had a seizure for
which she was loaded on Phenytoin.  She remained seizure free for
the rest of her hospitalization.  She refused
electroencephalogram or magnetic resonance scan at that time. It
was suggested that it be followed up as an outpatient. Psychiatry
followed her and recommended started Celexa but holding Seroquel
or any benzodiazepine or opiate.  At that time, she was started
on low dose Celexa.  She was seen by physical therapy who
determined that she was safe for discharge home.  However, her
[**Hospital3 **] refused her return so she has been screened for
rehabilitation and found and accepted at Star of [**Doctor Last Name **].  She
therefore was transferred to that facility.
