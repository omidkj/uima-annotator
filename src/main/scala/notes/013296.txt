Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 yo M with multiple medical problems, presenting with
altered mental status, hypotension,hypoxia, and urinary tract
infection.

1)Hypotension: Initial impression was that pt had urosepsis and
was intravascularly deplete (though total body overloaded). He
was hydrated gently overnight with some improvement in his blood
pressure. Attempts were then made to diurese the patient which
resulted in hypotension that necessitated a brief stay in the
MICU. In the MICU the patient was given 3L of fluid with
improvement in his blood pressures. Adrenal insufficiency was
considered, but the patient's am cortisol was 18, inconsistent
with this diagnosis. Thereafter, the patient had stable blood
pressures, however he has required fluid bolusing to maintain
urine output due to periods of decreased PO intake and
overdiuresis.

2)Hypoxia:Pt cxr on admission consistent with pulmonary edema,
as well as L sided pleural effusion. In the setting of
urosepsis, the edema was likely due to capillary leak, rather
than diminished cardiac output. The patient continued to require
oxygen through out his stay, and had at times a recurrent L
pleural effusion (see below). At the time of discharge, pt is
being diuresed with goal of negative 500cc to 1L per day.

3)Atrial Fibrillation:Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] had episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation while hospitalized. His rate was difficult to
control during his hypotension and volume
depletion--digitalization was attempted but unsuccessful. As the
patient's beta blocker was restarted, he had improved rate
control with HR in the 70s-90s. Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] was continued on
coumadin and his INR was therapeutic at the time of discharge,
but should be followed closely while he is on levofloxacin.

4)CHF: The pateint presented with signs of volume overload. As
discussed above, this was most likely due to capillary leak in
the setting of sepsis than frank CHF. After fluid rescusitation,
however the patient had persistent vascular congestion and a
recurrent L pleural effusion. A cardiac echo was obtained to
assess the patient's valve patency and ejection fraction. This
showed his mitral valve prosthesis to be functioning well, and
that his EF is 40%. As the patient's urosepsis resolved and his
blood pressure improved, gentle diuresis was initiated. Brisk
diuresis was avoided due to fear of volume contraction resulting
in metabolic alkalosis, as earlier in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course he became somnolent with an elevated pCO2 in response to
brisk diuresis. As pt was diuresed, acetazolamide was added to
attenuate further elevation in his bicarbonate and to increase
his respiratory drive, this was eventually held due to concern
that it might be contributing to the pt's lethargy. At present,
pt lasix is on hold due to his low PO intake and the feeling
that he is intravascularly depleted.

5)L pleural effusion:this was noted on admission CXR.
Consideration was given to thoracentesis as this effusion was
not noted on previous CXR, however the attending felt that this
was most likely due to CHF. After the patient was transferred to
the ICU service, an attempt to access the fluid with ultrasound
guided thoracentesis was undertaken. At the time of the
proceedure, there was not enough fluid to tap. OVer the next two
days, however, the patient's CXR appeared to have a L sided
effusion, thus a chest CT was obtained on [**5-5**] which confirmed
the presence of a large L sided loculated pleural effusion. One
pocket of this effusion was tapped on [**2135-5-7**], 500cc of
transudative fluid was removed. The pulmonary service saw this
patient and felt that the etiology of the effusion was most
likely post-operative, and that given his lack of temp or of
elevated WBC count, he did not require definative drainage of
the loculations via VATS.

6)Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] has many years of untreated
sleep apnea which (combined with his scoliosis)has led to
chronic CO2 retention. His Bicarbonate is chronically around 35,
suggesting that his baseline CO2 is likely in the 60s. In the
setting of aggressive diuresis, Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] developed volume
contraction and a metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate around 40)
which caused him to be acutely somnolent with a pCO2 near 80.
This resolved with hydration and resolution of volume
contraction. Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] continues to display daytime fatigue and
frequently falls asleep--this is likely due to his untreated
sleep apnea. The hope is that Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] can be transferred to a
facility that will allow him to use nasal pillow CPAP as he has
not been able to tolerate the  nasal mask or the face mask.
Treatment of his Sleep apnea would no doubt greatly improve his
heart failure as well.

7)Urinary tract infection: Pt urine culture grew two strains of
pan-sensitive klebsiella. He was treated with Levofloxacin and
finished a 14d course on [**5-10**].

8)Indwelling foley:Since his CABG/MVR, Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] has had an
indwelling foley. Multiple attempts to remove the foley have
only resulted in reinsertion. According to the patient, his
urologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] told him that "a proceedure" would be
necessary to ensure that he could urinate on his own when t
