male with past medical history of tobacco use, hypertension,
diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, who went to the Emergency
Department at [**Hospital1 69**] [**Hospital 620**]
Campus on the date of admission with complaint of substernal
chest pressure which began the prior evening.  The pain was
associated with shortness of breath, nausea, and emesis.  Of
note, patient's electrocardiogram showed ST segment
elevations in II, III, and aVF.  The patient was given
Integrilin, Heparin, aspirin, Morphine, Lopressor, and
nitroglycerin.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for catheterization.

At catheterization, he was found to have an proximal
occlusion in his right coronary artery.  The patient
underwent PTCA and stent placement.  He was found to have
TIMI-2 flow and residual spasm in the mid right coronary
artery.  Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and the
patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Emphysema.
2. Diabetes.

6. Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS:

6. Univasc.

ALLERGIES:  Bacitracin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies use of alcohol.  The patient states
that he smokes one pack per day of tobacco x40 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Obese male lying in bed in
no acute distress.  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.2, blood
pressure 90/57, heart rate 84, respiratory rate 23, and O2
saturation is 94% on 2 liters.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Mucous membranes moist.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:
Obese, difficult to assess neck veins.  Heart:  Heart sounds
obscured by intra-aortic balloon pump.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen is obese, nontender, and
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  1+ lower extremity
edema, right groin P.A. catheter/intra-aortic balloon pump in
place.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  Examination is
otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  From outside hospital showed a white count
of 12.5, hematocrit of 40.8, and a platelet count of 349.
Sodium was 128, potassium 4.7, chloride 91, bicarb 24, BUN 9,
creatinine 0.8, and a glucose of 225, with a magnesium of
1.6.  CK was elevated at 3445, troponin greater than 50.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm at 98 beats per
minute, normal P-R interval, prolonged QTC, left axis
deviation, 2 mm ST segment elevation in lead II, 3 mm ST
segment elevation aVF, ST segment depression in I, aVL, V2
and V3, right sided leads disclosed 1 mm ST segment elevation
in V4.

CATHETERIZATION RESULTS:  LMCA:  60-70% occlusion of mid
vessel, left anterior descending artery diffuse
irregularities left circumflex, diffuse irregularities right
coronary artery occluded proximally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted to the CCU for
further management.  He was initially admitted on dopamine
and intra-aortic balloon pump.  After arrival to the unit,
patient developed hematemesis, bradycardia/respiratory
arrest.  Patient was bagged with good oxygenation, but there
was a prolonged and difficult intubation by Anesthesia team.
During to the patient's hematemesis, Integrilin was stopped.

Airway establishment was eventually achieved.  Patient was
maintained on dopamine, dobutamine, and intra-aortic balloon
pump.  GI consultation was obtained regarding the patient's
hematemesis.  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, an attempt
was made to perform transesophageal echocardiogram to
evaluate mediastinal widening observed on chest x-ray.

Transesophageal echocardiogram was aborted due to inability
to intubate the esophagus.

Patient's condition continued to worsen.  His blood pressure
declined on the intra-aortic balloon pump despite multiple
pressors.  The patient's urine output continued to decline.
Family was informed about patient's poor prognosis, and
decided that the patient to make patient DNR.  Patient
expired on the morning of [**6-7**].

DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post stent placement to
right coronary artery.
2. Respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed.
4. Emphysema.
5. Diabetes.
