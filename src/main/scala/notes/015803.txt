History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52947**] is a 75 yo F w/PMHx sx for DM2, PVD, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, atrial flutter, and TB s/p LUL resection who
presented after surgery [**2180-1-18**] for left Charcot foot. Patient
was noted to have somnolence and decreased O2 sats as well as
metabolic acidosis after the procedure and was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.  Patient also noted to have
metabolic acidosis as well.
.
MICU course:  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was found to be in aflutter and
CHF.  Was Diuresed with Lasix with some relief.  Renal is
following for ? of new onset RTA with protenuria. She remained
tachycardic to 110-120's with evidence of fluid retention.
Cardiology consulted, and TEE [**2180-1-21**] with successful d/c
cardioversion of her Afib. + some concerns of mental status
change in the ICU.
.
Patient has no complaints. She denies nausea, vomiting, SOB,
chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, diarrhea, dysuria.
She reports that her shortness of breath is much improved from
admission to the ICU.  She reports her baseline ADL's as able to
ambulate around her house independently.  She has been limited
the past 2 months by her foot disease.

Surface ECHO [**2180-1-21**]: Left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction (?metabolic,
long-standing tachycardia). Moderate calcific aortic stenosis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Elevated left and right-sided
intracardiac filling pressures. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-11-5**],
left ventricular systolic function has significantly declined.
Severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased, and pulmonary
hypertension is now identified.
.
TEE ECHO [**2180-1-21**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. A very small secundum atrial septal defect is present
(?postprocedural). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic arch is not well seen. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
ECG [**2180-1-21**]: NSR, AV block, + new T-wave inversions inferiorly
and V1-V3 after cardioversion
.
[**2180-1-22**] CXR: The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are
flattened.  There is marked cardiomegaly.  There are diffusely
increased interstitial markings.  There are small bilateral
pleural effusions, larger on the left.  Multichamber
cardiomegaly and small effusions.  Some of the interstitial
marking prominence could represent an atypical distribution of
CHF.  Differential diagnosis
includes chronic lung disease, the possibility of an infectious
interstitial infiltrate is considered much less likely.  Known
calcified nodes not wellvisualized radiographically.  Compared
with [**2180-1-18**], there has been improvement in the CHF findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F w/PMHx sx for DM2, HTN, PVD, hyperlipidemia admitted for
left Charcot foot repair, noted to have somnolence and metabolic
acidosis after procedure, now admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer
monitoring.
.
#. Respiratory distress. Patient with mild hypoxia and minimal
oxygen requirement, with CXR c/w fluid overload [**2180-1-18**]. Patient
also with nongap metabolic acidosis with compensatory
respiratory alkalosis.  On the medical floor, the patient was
diuresed with Lasix IV with good response and negative 1 l per
day. However, oxygen saturation did not improve. Patient
remained 91-93% on RA and would desaturate to 84% with activity.
This may be due to progressive interstitial lung disease in
addition to CHF. She was switched to oral Lasix and continued to
diuresis well. She worked with physical therapy but refused to
attempt the stairs saying that they were very different from the
stairs at her home. Multiple conversations were held with the
patient and her husband regarding her oxygen levels with
ambulation. The patient felt well and expressed the desire to
leave the hospital. They both felt confident that she would be
able to ambulate up the stairs at their home with help from her
husband if necessary. She is being discharged with home O2 for
ambulation.

# Cardiac: Evaluated and managed by the cardiology service
. Vessels: No hx of CAD, does have HTN/Dyslipidemia, + evidence
of new T-wave inversions after cardioversion
- Beta-blocker continued and tolerated
- No statin necessary as HDL 60, LDL 65
- started ASA therapy
. Pump: Surface Echo with + evidence of EF 35%, but > 55% on TEE
- Pump function continued to do well status post cardioversion
- Lasix Diuresis as above
. Rhythm:  Patient has known hx of atrial fibrillation/flutter,
cardioversion [**11-9**] and then again today [**2180-1-21**].
- rhythm controlled with beta-blocker
- coumadin initiated
.
#. Chronic Kidney Disease:  Patient appears to be near baseline
Cr.
Concern for RTA with elevated Proteinuria which is in neprotic
range, concern for possible multiple myeloma so renal service
consulted. Nephrotoxic medications avoided, all meds renally
dosed if necessary. Good urine output throughout admission. SPEP
negative and UPEP with multiple proteinaceous bands, with
predominance of albumin. Renal feels that patient needs a renal
