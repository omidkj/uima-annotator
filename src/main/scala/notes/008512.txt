Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 3113**]

AGE:  75-YEAR-OLD MALE.

HISTORY  OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 75-year-old male
with  a  history  is  Alzheimer  type dementia, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia,  and  old  inferior  MI, known coronary
artery  disease, urinary incontinence, prostate cancer status
post  irradiation  and  radical  prostatectomy  with  urinary
incontinence,  as  well  as  gastroesophageal reflux disease.
The patient presented in the CHF to the [**Hospital1 36918**].   It was determined that this is a result of
an  acute  myocardial  infarction  as  determined by enzymes.
They   ultimately   had   cardiac   catheterization   showing
significant  three-vessel disease including an LAD lesion and
oblique  marginal  and  a right coronary.  He was, therefore,
evaluated  by  the  Cardiac Surgical Service by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to
undergo a coronary artery bypass graft.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:    On  presentation,  the  patient was
alert.   He was mildly disoriented, but otherwise, understood
commands.   He was afebrile.  Vital signs were stable.  Lungs
were  clear.    Heart  was regular, without murmur or gallops
rhythm.  There was mild JVD.  The PMI was displaced laterally
in  the  fifth intercostal space.  Otherwise, the abdomen was
soft,  nontender  and nondistended.  Liver was not pulsatile.
There  were  no  varicosities.  He had no hepatosplenomegaly.
Lower   extremities  revealed  trace  edema.    He  had  some
superficial  varicosities  bilaterally,  right  greater  than
left.    Pulses  were  palpable of the posterior tibialis and
dorsalis pedis bilaterally with brisk capillary refill.

Chest  x-ray  showed,  on  the 10th, cephalization, increased
pulmonary  vascularity,  cardiomyopathy consistent with acute
congestive  heart  failure.    The EKG showed inferior Q-wave
from  previous  MI,  as  well  as  normal  sinus  rhythm with
evidence  of  left  distal  humerus.  Cardiac catheterization
showed  three-vessel  disease including left main disease and
EF  of  approximately  40%.  The chemistries revealed that he
had 142 sodium, 4.0 potassium, BUN and creatinine were 19 and
.7 respectively.  The CK was 384, troponin 2.4 and hematocrit
was 39.

Ultimately,  the  plan  was  made  to  proceed forward with a
coronary  artery  bypass graft.  This was done on [**2110-10-28**].
The  patient  went to the operating theatre, where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed   a  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  times  three,
including LIMA to LAD and reverse saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse  marginal  as  well as reverse saphenous vein graft to
the right coronary artery.

Postoperatively,    the   patient   was   on   nitroglycerin,
epinephrine  and propofol.  He was transferred to the Cardiac
Critical Care Unit.

On   postoperative   day  #1,  he  was  extubated.    He  was
hemodynamically  stable.    He  did  spike  a fever to 101.3.
Blood pressure was 160/48, being maintained on Neo-Synephrine
drip  now  of 2.  Heart rate was 90 and apaced.  The arterial
blood  gas  analysis  at that time showed a 7.47, 37, 98, 28.
The  Lasix  was  held for issuers of hypotension prior to the
Neo-Synephrine   being   added.     The  Neo-Synephrine  was,
therefore, weaned.  He was extubated on day #1, as previously
stated.  Ultimately, diet was advanced.  There were no issues
for renal.  Postoperative BUN and creatinines were 16 and .7.
The hematocrit was 30.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the floor by
postoperative  day  #1,  where  he  developed  some low-grade
delirium superimposed on his chronic underlying dementia.  On
postoperative  day #1, the patient stayed in the ICU.  He was
on  Cipromycin  and  Vancomycin  for  a  presumed  cellulitis
related  to  the  sternal wound.  Once the Neo-Synephrine was
weaned  by  postoperative day #2, the patient was transferred
to  the  floor.    By  postoperative  day  #2,  the Swan-Ganz
catheter  was  removed.   He was started on Lopressor, Lasix,
and  aspirin.   Chest tubes were removed.  Diet was advanced.
The  hematocrit was 21, for which he was transfused two units
of  packed  cells.    BUN  and  creatinine  were  12  and  .6
respectively.  By postoperative day #3, the patient was noted
to  be  in  atrial fibrillation.  The patient was, therefore,
given  Lopressor  titration,  which  he  quickly converted to
sinus  rhythm.   Initially, he was started on Amiodarone.  Of
note,  when  the  patient  was brought to the operating room,
they   were   unable   to   pass   the   Foley  catheter  and
intraoperative  emergent  urology  consultation  was made and
under  cystoscopy,  Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) 36919**]  placed  a urinary catheter.
This  was difficult as urinary catheter passage was secondary
to bladder-neck contracture status post radical prostatectomy
with  irradiation  postoperatively.  The catheter was to stay
in for a total of seven days from the time of surgery to come
out on [**2110-11-4**], after which time a voiding trial should be
carried  out  with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9345**].  He will continue on Cipro as
well.

On  postoperative  day  #3, the patient continued to do well.
He  began  rehabilitation  screening  and he was working with
Physical  Therapy.   Low-grade delirium steadily improved, as
the narcotic requirements decreased.

On  postoperative day #4, the hematocrit was 27.  The BUN and
creatinine  were  24  and  .9  respectively.  He had no other
issues.  He remained hemodynamically stable.  He was in sinus
rhythm at this time.  He was being maintained on beta-blocker
Amiodarone therapy.

By  postoperative day #6, the patient was ambulating on level
III  with  the  Department  of  Physical  Therapy.    He  was
tolerating  a  regular  diet.    He  was  having normal bowel
movement.   He remained afebrile.  The vital signs were 99.0,
83,  116/61, 20 respiratory rate, 92% on room air.  He was in
no  acute  distress.    He  was confused, alert, and oriented
times  two.   The sternum was stable with on drainage.  Steri
Strips  were  intact.   The heart was regular with no murmur.
The   lower  extremities  were  not  edematous.    The  right
saphenous vein site was clean, dry, and intact.  There was no
evidence  of  cellulitis,  with  Steri  Strips in place.  The
hematocrit was 28, BUN and creatinine 18 and .9 respectively.

DISCHARGE   STATUS:      The   patient   is   discharged   to
rehabilitation.

CONDITION  ON  DISCHARGE:    Stable,  afebrile,  and in sinus
rhythm.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.    Status  post  acute  myocardial infarction, significant
three-vessel  coronary  artery  disease, status post coronary
artery  bypass graft times three, LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein
graft  to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the
right coronary artery.

OTHER DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Alzheimer's dementia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.    Prostate  cancer status post radical prostatectomy with
irradiation     followed     by     urinary     incontinence,
gastroesophageal reflux disease.

FOLLOW-UP  CARE:    The patient's followup will include wound
check  in  one  week  from the time of discharge.  He will be
maintained on beta-blocker Amiodarone therapy.

In  the  postoperative  course, the Amiodarone therapy should
last   approximately   one   month.    Beta-blocker  will  be
indefinite.    The  patient  will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month
from the time of discharge.  He should have followup with his
cardiologist in two to
