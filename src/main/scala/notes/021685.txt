Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 73yo M admitted initially with complaint of R shoulder
pain. Following negative cardiac w/u in this patient with
significant cardiac history, pt was found to have a R upper lobe
nodule and subsequently found to be adenoca. Pt is now s/p RUL
and RML lobectomy - pod #18. [**Hospital 1094**] hospital course is significant
for transfer to the ICU 2nd to worsening SOB, desaturation, new
onset Afib with ventricular rate 120's-130's. Pt since that time
is reportedly rate controlled and had been later cardioverted.
Pt
was reintubated [**8-6**] 2nd to noted increase work of breathing.
Since that time other issues have included noted worsening
heart failure. Per chart, pt has been increasingly agitated,
disoriented, sedated. These sxs have been in an escalating
course
since transfer to ICU and [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes have increased around
[**8-15**],
[**8-16**]. Pt was intubated on exam this am and minimally response to
exam.  Trached on [**8-17**].

Breifly, patient transfered to MICU for eval of MS
changes/Failure to wean from Vent.  Sedatives and opiods weaned
without change in mental status.  Spiked fevers without obvious
source, but likely line infection.  Had intermittent GI
bleeding, ?source.  Episodes of occasional hypotension which at
times required pressors.  After d/w family members, because of
patients underlying dieseases, failure to wean off vent, and
lack of significant change in mental status, decision was made
to make patient Comfort Measures Only.  DNR/DNI.
