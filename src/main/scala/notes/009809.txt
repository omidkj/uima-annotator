Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for further management of GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of
atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse of 1 pint a day,
hypertension, and osteoarthritis who presented to [**Hospital1 10551**] on [**2197-4-13**] with bright red blood per rectum and black
tarry stools for two days. He presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2197-4-13**]
and was referred to the ED from there. He had reported about 6
bowel movements with dark red blood mixed in the stool.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], his initial HCT was 22.8, with BUN 59 and
creatinine of 1.12. He was initially given 2 units PRBCs with IV
lasix, IV protonix, and IV ativan for his history of alcohol. On
[**2197-4-14**], he underwent an upper endoscopy which
demonstrated a pyloric channel ulcer with healed margins, which
were biopsied. Visualization of the colon was limited by copious
amounts of blood. At CT of the abdomen and pelvis was completed
that demonstrated incomplete mixing of the oral contrast and
gastric contents, with moderate gastric distension. A soft
tissue mass in the right inguinal canal was felt to be secondary
to prior hernia repair.
.
He underwent a repeat upper endoscopy that again demonstrated no
active bleeding. Repeat colonoscopy demonstrated large amount of
old blood, with difficulty getting beyond hepatic flexure due to
view obscured by blood. He underwent a bleeding scan yesterday
([**2197-4-17**]) that was completed today, which per discussion with
[**Hospital1 392**] providers, was positive for distal dueodenal and proximal
jejunal bleed. Surgery had been following at the hospital and
along with the GI team recommended angiography, for which the
transfer was requested.
.
Prior to transfer, he had received a total of 13 units of PRBCs,
last one given on morning of transfer for HCT of 25 (lowest was
yesterday at 18, received 5 units that day). There was a
question of hypotension during colonoscopy and preparation, down
to the 80'-90's systolic. He has a left subclavian cordis in
place. Per sign-out from [**Hospital1 392**], his baseline HCT is low 30's.
.
On morning of transfer, his BP 108/72 (lowest 94/45 at 1 AM)
with MAP's of 63-88. He was reported to be in atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 80-110's. He was on an amiodarone
drip, protonix drip, thiamine, albumin, and ativan for CIWA.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient reported he was thirsty, but
otherwise had no complaints.


Past Medical History:
- Atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin for over a year, stopped
due to drinking history and fall risk (stopped [**2195-4-9**] after

time.

[**4-18**] Angiography
IMPRESSION: No active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or
angiodysplasia in the celiac, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territories.
.
.
[**4-20**] Colonoscopy
Impression: Ulceration and erythema in the descending colon
(thermal therapy)
Polyp in the descending colon
Diverticulum in the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
Recommendations: Routine post procedure orders.
Avoid all NSAIDs.
Will proceed to capsule endoscopy.
Continue PPI for ulceration seen on EGD.
.
.
[**4-20**] Small Bowel Enteroscopy
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Erythema with granularity and erosions with three areas
of clean-based ulcerations were seen in the prepyloric region of
the lesser curve of the stomach. The ulcerations were provoked
and only one oozed with minimal blood. No visible vessel or clot
was seen. One endoclip was successfully applied to the
ulceration that was oozing at the prepylorus area for the
purpose of hemostasis.
Duodenum:
 Contents: Bile was seen throughout the duodenum without any
evidence of blood.
jejunum:
 Contents: Bile was seen throughout the jejunum without any
evidence of blood.
ileum: Not examined.
.
Impression: Erythema and erosion in the pylorus (endoclip)
Blood in the duodenum
Blood in the jejunum
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid to distal
jejunum
Recommendations: Continue to monitor HCT and provide supportive
measures with blood products and fluids as needed.
Would proceed to angiography to localize and embolize bleeding
source.
[**Hospital1 **] PPI.
Please check H.pylori antibody and treat if positive.
Additional notes: The patient's bleeding source is likely distal
to the mid-jejunum, as we do not believe the ulcerations in the
stomach were the cause of his aggressive GIB given the nature of
the lesions.

[**2197-4-21**] Capsule Endoscopy Report:
Procedure info & findings:
1. Multiple Angioectasia (nonbleeding) through the small bowel
2.
The capsule did not reach the cecum.
Summary & recommendations:
Summary: 1. Multiple Angioectasia (nonbleeding) through the
small
bowel 2. The capsule did not reach the cecum. incomplete capsule
endoscopy
Recommendations: 1. Follow Hgb/HCT 2. Follow up with referring
physician 3. Please obtain KUB prior to an MRI examination.
Complete evaluation of the entire small bowel could not be
performed as the capsule did not reach the cecum. 4. Enteroscopy
to evaluate the angioectasia
