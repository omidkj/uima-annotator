The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name,
"[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 2048**]" and the medical record number.  It is
additionally labeled "posterior leaflet, mitral valve." It
consists of a valve cusp with chorda tendinae measuring 2.2 cm

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and went directly to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve repair. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one she appeared to be doing well
and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. A small pneumothorax was noted on post chest tube pull
CXR. Repeat serial  CXr's revealed stable pneumothorax. She had
a brief episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which reponded to
IV lopressor and IV amiodarone bolus. She was then started on
oral amiodarone and maintained sinus rhythm. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
evaluated by physical therapy and cleared for d/c to home with
VNA services on POD 4.
