Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Gastric pacer placement
2. Jejunostomy tube placement
3. PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 34 y/o M w /h/o diabetes, on insulin pump,
gastroparesis, peptic ulcer disease, who is transferred from OSH
([**Hospital 794**] Hospital, [**Hospital1 789**] RI), after 6 week stay for nausea,
vomiting and abdominal pain, for gastric pacemaker placement.

In brief, the patient reports ongoing pain symptoms for the past
one year, with difficulty tolerating POs and constant nausea.
This most recent admission resulted after he had several
episodes of vomiting and acute mid-epigastric abdominal pain not
relieved with outpatient pain meds. The pain ranges from [**2124-6-8**]
to [**11-13**] in intensity. It is similar to prior pain episodes. No
radiation to the flank or back. No associated fever, chills,
night sweats, brbpr or melanotic stools.

For the past two months he had been only taking in only limited
POs and had been on chronic TPN. TPN discontinued at OSH and
started on J tube with tube feedings. Pain controlled with IV
dilaudid. Attempt to wean over last week from 4mg q3 to 3mg q3
to 1.5mg q3, however have had difficulty weaning due to rebound
abdominal pain, nausea. Plan to transfer for evaluation of
gastric pacmeaker.

Of note, hospital course complicated by PICC infection with coag
neg staph ([**4-6**], last positive [**2-12**]) treated with 14 days of
vanco.

On arrival, patient tearful, complaining of [**11-13**] mid-epigastric
pain, nausea. No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is minimal
dependent atelectasis in the left lower lobe. The imaged portion
of the heart and pericardium appears unremarkable. In the
subcutaneous tissues of the right upper abdominal wall, a
metallic structure is consistent with the implanted gastric
pacemaker. The pacemaker lead the enters the peritoneum via a
right upper abdominal approach, and courses anteriorly adjacent
to the abdominal wall before diving to terminate at the greater
curvature of the stomach. There is a small amount of free
intraperitoneal air adjacent to the pacemaker lead just deep to
the pacer pocket (2:42), a finding that could be associated with
surgical introduction of the lead. A jejunal feeding tube is in
place via a left paramedian approach terminating in the left
mid-abdomen. The large and small bowel loops are normal in
caliber. No intra-abdominal abscesses are identified. The liver,
spleen, gallbladder, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. The
pancreas is atrophic. No renal masses are identified, and there
is no hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The appendix is
normal. The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid colon,
prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable. There are no
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.

BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows show no lesions worrisome for osseous
metastatic disease.

IMPRESSION:

1. Status post placement of a gastric pacemaker with a small
amount of free intraperitoneal air, a nonspecific finding that
could relate to postsurgical state .

2. No evidence of abscess or bowel obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 34 y/o M w /h/o diabetes I, on insulin pump,
gastroparesis, peptic ulcer disease, who was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH ([**Hospital 794**] Hospital, [**Hospital1 789**] RI), after a 6
week stay for nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, for gastric
pacemaker placement.
.
# gastroparesis- acute on chronic abdominal pain, felt secondary
to gastroparesis. Gastroenterology consulted and recommended
gastric pacer placement given duration of symptoms and failure
of medical therapy.  Gastric pacer placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2122-2-18**].  Post-operatively he went to the hospitalist service
for recovery and further management. However, on the hospitalist
service, attempts had been made to control his hyperglycemia
with boluses from the patient's insulin pump as well as SC
insulin on a scale. Unfortunately despite intensive efforts this
was not successful in lowering the glucose and narrowing the
anion gap, and the patient remained in DKA.
.
MICU course:
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU in DKA, where he
was put on an insulin drip, and his glucose came under control
overnight, and his anion gap narrowed to within normal limits.
He continued to have significant pain which was treated with a
hydromorphone PCA. He received tube feeds and was transitioned
to subcutaneous insulin scale. He was transferred back to the
hospitalist service.

Post-MICU course:
The patient's diet was advanced, while tube feeds were
continued, for his malnutrition. The patient's pain significant
improved and his hydromorphone PCA was rapidly tapered over 3
days. A plan was made that the patient would not continue any
opioids on discharge.  He was instructed to remain on J-tube
feeds until further evaluation by his gastroenterologist.
