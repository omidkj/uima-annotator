drainage and open appendectomy.

[**3-28**], [**3-30**], [**5-5**], [**5-15**] [**2118**]: EGD (endoscopy of upper
gastrointestinal tract)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66yo man with a history of CAD (s/p RCA DES
[**2113**]), CHF (EF 40%-->60%), HTN, and PUD complaining of several
months of abdominal pain.  He describes the pain as generalized
(worst in lower quadrants), constant, severe, exacerbated by
eating, alleviated with burping, and notes associated
significant weight loss (unable to quantify).  He denies fever,
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, and
never had similar pain prior to several months ago.
.
He was admitted [**Date range (1) 46143**]/[**2118**] for this abdominal pain and
underwent a workup including abdominal CT, MRI, MRA, MRCP, EGD,
and EUS with FNA of a pancreatic lesion in the body.  The
etiology of his abdominal pain was unclear; the differential at
this time included PUD, pancreatic malignancy, or mesenteric
ischemia.  At a followup appointment with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-11**], he
developed severe [**10-8**] pain and was brought to the ED by
ambulance.  Physical exam was concerning for LLQ tenderness
without rebound or guarding and labs were notable for WBC count
of 14.1.  CT abdomen revealed mildly distended loops of bowel
without transition point so surgery was consulted concerning
possible SBO, which was refractory to conservative management.
On [**4-17**] he underwent exploratory laparotomy with LOA,
appendectomy, drainage of hemorrhagic ascites.  Appendix
pathology is notable for chronic arteritis, and so rheumatology
was consulted and patient was transferred to the medicine
service.
.
On the floor at time of transfer to medicine, the patient
reports mild lower abdominal discomfort (+prior episodes) unlike
the pain that brought him to the hospital (which resolved after
surgery).

.
In the ED, initial VS: 10 97 88 172/97 18 100.  He appeared very
uncomfortable, and was very tender to palpation at LLQ, but no
guarding or rebound.  Guiac was positive per rectal.  He
appeared dry.  He received levo, flagyl, morphine, and zofran.
.
Currently, patient reports his pain is about [**3-8**].  He denies
nausea/vomiting.  He has no chest pain or shortness of breath.
No fever, chills, no cough.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

STUDIES:
MRI/MRCP ([**2119-3-14**]):
1. 0.8 x 1.5 cm lesion in the distal body of the pancreas with
relative enhancement, might correspond to the pancreatic
neoplasm. Short term follow up in 3 months or EUS study is
recommended for further evaluation.
2. Small amount of ascites.
.
EGD ([**2119-3-28**]):
- Erythema, friability, granularity and congestion in the
pylorus (biopsy)
- A few scattered polypoid lesions were noted in the second part
of duodenum. (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
- bx:
A.  Antrum "hilar":
Chronic inactive gastritis; focal intestinal metaplasia; [**Doctor Last Name 6311**]
stains for H. pylori will be sent as an addendum..
B.  Duodenum, polyp:
Duodenal mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized;
multiple levels have been examined.
.
EUS ([**2119-3-30**]):
- Submucosal mass with overlying hemorrhagic mucosa was noted in
the second part of the duodenum - unclear clinical significance.
- EUS: A 1.5 cm poorly-localized abnormal area was noted in the
pancreas body - this showed features of focal chronic
pancreatitis, however, a neoplasm could not be ruled ou
