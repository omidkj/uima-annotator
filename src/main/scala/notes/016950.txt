History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81133**] is a 67 y.o. M with HCV, HBV, hypertension, and

tremors in all of his extremities; thus, he took 35 tablets of
800 mg of Neurontin over 36 hours starting at 6 pm night prior
to admission. Then he continued to take this overnight given
continued extremity tremors. His last dose was likely around 5
or 6 AM. Pt reportedly was trying to get "high." He also notes
that he was taking ASA 325 mg x 15 since 6 pm night prior to
admission. He did this to help relieve a headache and chills
that he gets every night. Last dose was around 6 AM on morning
of admission. He continued to feel shaky in all extremities, and
decided that he should come and get evaluated in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
The patient denies SI, HI, AH, and VH.

CT HEAD [**2176-9-2**]: IMPRESSIONS:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Stable small vessel chronic ischemic change

base is most likely atelectasis; developing consolidation is
also a consideration in the right clinical setting. Spiculated
nodules seen on CT not well seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course - Patient is medically clear for discharge to
inpatient psychiatry unit for further treatement. No sign of
infection.  No adverse effect from ASA/neurontin ingestion.
MRSA screen negative to date.  This has been discussed with
attending.

# Salicylate overdose: ASA level 35 on presentation to ED, but
unknown timing of last dose of ASA. Levels were in a [**Doctor Last Name 352**] zone
for toxicity at 35, but were downward trending. Toxicology was
consulted in the ED, and the patient was managed by intravenous
bicarbonate to alkalanize the urine. No dialysis was required.
The bicarb infusion was stopped when the asa level was <30.  On
hospital day 2, his serum ASA level was 19.  At this time,
toxicology signed off.  At no time did the patient experience
symptoms of salicylate overdose--no nausea, vomiting or
respiratory depression.  EKG had no new changes and was normal
sinus rhythm.  Patient removed his IV access on his own and
began to refuse further lab draws and vital signs, however he
was medically stable when he started this behavior.

# Psych: Because of the overdose, a psychiatric consultation was
obtained, and felt that the patient needed to be observed. A
section 12 was placed. Overall, it is doubtful that this was an
intentional overdose, and more likely a result of impulsivity.
Psych f/u was obtained and recommended inpatient psychiatry unit
for further management.  Psychiatry has seen him daily and made
recommendations as needed.

# Neurontin Overdose: No effects were seen.  Neurology was
consulted in the ED and felt his history regarding his Neurontin
overdose and tremors was inconsistent.  Neurontin was
discontinued during the admisison and patient't tremor was much
improved per his on account.

# Tremors: Felt to be due to albuterol use, however they seem to
be chronic.  Patient states he had overdosed on nuerontin to
treat these symptoms.  On evaluation by neurology, he was
non-compliant with exam.  On [**9-4**], the neurology consult
formally signed off on the patient and felt that he was having
no acute neruological issue and had no focal neurological
deficits.  On admission, TSH, vit B12 and Folate were sent and
determined to be within normal limits.  Gabapentin not to be
restarted on discharge.

# Leukocytsosis - Patient was admitted with white blood cell
count of 13.5, which declined to 11.5 over 24 hours.  Chest
x-ray was not consistent with infiltrate and most likely
atelectasis.  Patient was entirely asymptommatic during
admission.  Patient refused further blood draws.  He had a
previous admission with positive blood culture for coagulase
negative staph, however this was felt to be contamminent.
Repeat blood cultures 2 days after that culture were negative.
Blood culture drawn on admission (~10 days after last blood
cultures) are pending but negative to date.  MRSA screen in the
ICU is still pending, but as of 12:00 on [**2176-9-4**] is negative.
At no time during the admission did patient have a fever.  On
[**9-3**] patient started refusing vital signs.  He shows no sign of
infection at this time.  No cough.  Patient did have a headache
prior to admission and had complained about it to Neurology.
There was notation of possible LP, however patient refused. CT
Head was negative for acute process on admission.  On [**9-4**],
neurology re-visited patient and he stated he had not headache
or tremor and the team signed off.  Medically, the patient is
clear for discharge.

# COPD: No sign of exacerbation at this time.  Continue
albuterol and ipratropium prn while admitted.  On discharge,
plan to restart Albuterol inhaler, Fluticasone, Formoterol,
Tiotropium and Montelukast.

# Alcohol abuse: By history, patient has history of alcohol
abuse, however stated to physicians during admission that he had
not recently drank.  Initially, he was place on CIWA to monitor
for with
