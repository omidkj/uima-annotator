Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness, Dyspnea on Exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker Placement

History of Present Illness:

Mr. [**Known lastname 7958**] is a 72 yo M with PMH of CAD, CHF (EF 20%) DM2,
HTN, COPD presenting with one month history of dyspnea on
exertion and lightheadedness with exertion. Per his admission
note he reported that for the last month he has been having
shortness of breath with exertion such as walking acrossing the
room while as prior to that he had been able to walk two miles
without difficulty. In addition, he has been having
lightheadedness associated with the dyspnea requiring him to
stop and rest and hold onto something to steady himself. He does
reports that his weight has decreased from 285->272 over the
past month as well. He denied any chest pain, palpitations,
fainting/loss of consciousness, fevers, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, diarrhea.
.
According to his wife he has been in an irregular heart rhythm
for the past month however he did not go to his doctor until the
day of admission.
.
Right leg with recurrant cellulitis, has been treated with
antibiotics in the past with improvement.
.
In the ED T98.6 HR 100 BP 125/71 RR 14 93%RA. He was given ASA
325, levofloxacin 750 and metoprolol 25 po x1.
.
He was admitted to the medical service.  His anti-biotics were
discontinued as there was doubt the small infiltrate represented
pneumonia.  He remained afebrile with blood pressures ranging
110-120s systolic and HR ranging from 90s-112.  He was rate
controlled with increasing doses of metoprolol with home dose
150 mg daily to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] then to TID on [**2178-6-17**].  He was
started on coumadin.
On the night of CCU transfer he was found down on floor of his
room.  His roommate called for help.  The patient had been on
telemetry at the time. His rhythm of atrial fibrillation had
changed to ventricular escape with pauses up to 7 seconds.
Briefly no pulse could be detected. He had spontaneous return of
circulation. He received no atropine or epinephrine.  He was
transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.  He states that
he doesn't remember the events either before or after being
surrounded by medical and nursing staff.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. He states that at home
he had several episodes of feeling lightheaded particularly with
standing up.  He denies having passed out.  He states that he
has lost ~[**9-20**] pounds over the past 3 weeks. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, PND, orthopnea, palpitations, or syncope.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
.
EKG demonstrated afib @ 95 rightward axis no ST-T changes.
delayed RWP with no significant change
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: afib @ 60s. then ventricular escape with
~7 second pauses
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2175-6-1**] demonstrated: The left
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction
20 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle
(Definity used for left ventricular opacification). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

LABORATORY DATA: see addendum below
.
Imaging:
[**2178-6-16**] CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Small, focal right upper lobe airspace consolidation, most
consistent with pneumonia. Recommend followup chest CT
post-treatment to ensure resolution.
.
[**2178-6-16**] RLE Duplex:
No DVT in the right lower extremity.
.
[**2178-6-16**] CXR:
Right lower lobe patchy opacity may indicate, focal atelectasis,

exaggerated by overlying soft tissues, however an early
pneumonia can not be excluded
.
[**2178-6-18**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process
.
[**2178-6-18**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Improvement in vascular engorgement. Less well
visualized right upper lobe opacity may indicate resolving
aspiration pneumonia. However, the recommendation for chest CT
in four to six weeks was
