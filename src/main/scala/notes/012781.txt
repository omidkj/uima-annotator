History of Present Illness:
76-year-old woman with history of recently diagnosed lung
adenoca, protein-losing enteropathy, afib, was transferred from
[**Hospital 1562**] hospital after having seizure at home.
.
Per son, patient was eating at home when she suddenly had
leftward gaze, slurred speech, and confusion. Son called EMS.
During the ambulance ride to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, she again had
leftward gaze and slurred speech and at one time was
unresponsive. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 1562**] ED, she was reportedly
responsive again, however. Was given lorazepam in [**Hospital1 1562**] ED.
WBC 8.9, Hct 42, plt 413, IRN 1.0. Cr 0.54. CE neg. Head CT at
[**Hospital1 1562**] revealed 3-cm lesion in the right frontal parietal
region with no midline shift. Patient was intubated for airway
protection. Was given dexamethasone 40 mg IV x 1, loaded with
fosphenytoin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, afebrile, HR 80s, BP 120s/80s, vented.
Repeat head CT showed 3-cm right frontal mass with surrounding
edema but no midline shift. CXR showed possible developing
pneumonia the in the RUL; therefore, the patient was given
pip-tazo 4.5 mg IV x 1 and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1. Neurosurg was
consulted, recommending dex 4 mg q6h and levetiracetam 1000 mg
[**Hospital1 **]. Heme-onc fellow was aware, recommending [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission.
.
ROS: not obtained due to patient's being intubated
.


Past Medical History:
* Lung cancer: adenocarcinoma, followed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10919**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 3274**]
- [**2191-1-25**]: admitted for SBO, imaging revealed pulmonary nodules
in RUL and RLL as well as possible spine mets with a collapsed
T10 and a partially collapsed T12; work-up delayed due to poor
clinical status
- [**2191-6-26**]: PET revealed that RUL and RLL nodules were FGD avid;
considered poor surgical candidate
- [**2191-8-26**]: seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] in spine center, perc biopsy of
spine lesions suggested to rule out mets
- [**2191-11-18**]: transbronchial bx performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
positive for adenocarcinoma
* Atrial fibrillation.
* Protein-losing enteropathy on TPN for about a year and a
half.  Last TPN was in [**2191-5-26**]; has been having PO food since.
Her course with her protein losing enteropathy and TPN was
complicated by line infections and several hospitalizations.
* Right torn rotator cuff.
* Status post removal of basal cell carcinoma.
* Small bowel obstruction managed conservatively in [**2190**].
* Small bowel obstruction in [**2191-2-25**] requiring
exploratory
laparoscopic lysis of adhesions and ileocecal bypass.
.

cancers.

[**11-27**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Right frontal lobe 3 cm mass with
surrounding edema. Given history, this is a presumed metastasis.
No evidence of hemorrhage, shift of midline structures, or
herniation. Findings were posted to the ED dashboard.

[**11-28**] Bilat Venous dopplers: IMPRESSION: DVT involving the right
superficial femoral vein.

[**11-28**] MRI head: IMPRESSION:
1. Three enhancing lesions in the brain compatible with
metastatic disease. Suggestion of leptomeningeal seeding by
location of 1 or 2 of these lesions.
2. Other nonspecific white matter FLAIR abnormalities in the
periventricular white matter as well as the left brachium
pontis.
.
KUB: 1. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. No evidence for
obstruction or ileus. No
intraperitoneal free air or pneumatosis.
2. IVC filter.
.
CXR [**12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Development of pleural effusions and
volume loss in the left
lower lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma
with mediastinal node mets, history of protein-losing
enteropathy, presented with seizure from home, found to have
likely new brain mets.
.
Plan:
# Seizure with altered mental status: Most likely from new brain
lesion, which is concerning for brain mets from her lung ca.
Neurosurgery, oncology were called and patient started on
levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **], dexamethasone 4mg q6h. MRI showed 3
enhancing lesions c/w metastases.  Patient was extubated on day
2 of hospital stay and transitioned well.  Family meeting was
held and it was decided to make patient DNR/DNI, but offer whole
brain radiation for palleation.  Rad-onc consulted and patient
received WBR. XRT completed and the patient was alert, oriented,
and ambulating well prior to discharge. After discharge the
patient is to continue a steroid taper to be followed by primary
oncology as outlined on discharge medications.
.
# Lung cancer: Recent transbronchial biopsy of mediastinal node
revealed adenocarcinoma.Biopsy of spinal lesion revealed no
tumor and now with new brain mets/ stage IV. Completed  WBR.
Further management as per primary oncology.
.
# Right lower extremity DVT: bilateral LENIs showed DVT and IVC
filter was placed.  Anticoagulation was not started as patient
is at risk for bleed with new brain mets.
.
# Possible pneumonia: with opacity in RUL, concerning for
aspiration in the setting of seizure. Patient does have a
history of MRSA bacteremia and VRE from abdominal wound.
Empiric pip-tazo and vanco were transitioned to ceftriaxone on
hospital day 1 as patient was at home prior to this episode.
Cultures without growth. Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) **] remained afebrile and was
transitioned to PO cefpodoxime and completed a 7 day course of
antibiotics.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Remained in sinus rhythm.  Continued dilt
60 mg q8h. Hold off on warfarin given risk of intracranial
bleeding.
.
# Protein-losing enteropathy: most recently on TPN in [**2191-5-26**].
S/p abd surgeries for SBO.  Tolerated PO after extubation.
.
# FEN:  Regular diet, passed speech and swallow eval
.
#Thrush: Discharged on Nystatin solution.
.

# Code:  DNR/DNI
.
# Comm:  son [**Name (NI) **] and daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4027**] are HCPs,
