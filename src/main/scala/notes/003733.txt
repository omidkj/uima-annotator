History of Present Illness:
This 60-year-old man has COPD and coronary artery disease as

CXR [**2150-2-20**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-19**]:
Lung volumes remain quite low. Mild pulmonary edema is new,
accompanied by increased caliber to mediastinal and hilar
vessels. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. Tip of the
Swan-Ganz catheter projects over the right descending pulmonary
artery. ET tube tip ends at the thoracic inlet, partially
withdrawn since the prior study. Nasogastric tube passes below
the diaphragm and out of view. Small left pleural effusion is
presumed. No pneumothorax.
.
Duplex Doppler Abd/Pelvis [**2150-2-20**]
HISTORY: 60-year-old male status post Whipple's procedure.

IMPRESSION: Replaced common hepatic artery posterior to the
portal vein was not visualized; however, normal arterial
waveforms were obtained in the right and left hepatic arteries.
.
CXR [**2150-2-20**]
REASON FOR EXAM: Increased O2 requirement.

FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes. Increased diffuse density
of the left hemithorax is most likely due to layering pleural
effusion. Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by the low lung
volumes, appears to be mildly enlarged. There is engorgement of
the mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature with no overt
pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe atelectasis is new. NG tube
tip is out of view, below the diaphragm.

IMPRESSION: Increased left pleural effusion with increased
adjacent atelectasis.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2150-4-12**] 10:18 PM
IMPRESSION: Persistent but slightly improved retrocardiac
opacity which may be secondary to aspiration, pneumonia, or
atelectasis. Left pleural effusion is unchanged. Subsegmental
right lower lobe atelectasis.
.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2150-4-7**] 1:23 PM
IMPRESSION: Penetration and intermittent aspiration with thin
and nectar consistency barium.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-4-5**] 4:47 AM
FINDINGS: The left chest tube is unchanged. There continued to
be bilateral pleural effusions moderate in size that layer
posteriorly, given positioning it is unclear but these are
likely increased compared to prior. There is pulmonary vascular
re-distribution, perihilar haze consistent with fluid overload.
There is obscuration of both hemidiaphragms due to the effusions
and an underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded.
.
ECHO
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2150-3-31**] 11:16 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall, no significant change. Infarcted spleen and
subsequent hematoma is unchanged in size, with indwelling
large-bore catheter. Heterogeneity within the hepatic
parenchyma, left lobe, likely due to retractor injury, no
definite evidence for infection at this time.
2. Loculated left pleural effusion with near-complete collapse
of the left lower lobe. Small right effusion and atelectasis.
.
CT PERITINEAL DRAIN EXCLUDING APPENDICEAL  [**2150-3-21**] 2:39 PM
IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided percutaneous drainage of
splenic collection.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2150-3-10**] 3:33 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Splenic vein thrombosis with extensive splenic infarction.
Interval development of gas within the infarcted splenic
parenchyma concerning for infection.
2. Multiple poorly defined hypoenhancing areas in the left
hepatic lobe that may be related to retractor injury. However,
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
3. Small left pleural effusion and near complete collapse of the
left lower lobe.
4. Emphysema.
5. No definite evidence of enterocutaneous fistula. However,
please note that the small bowel was not well opacified with
oral contrast at the time of the examination which limits the
sensitivity of this exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted after a Pylorus-preserving Whipple w/
J-tube placement and placement of gold fiducial seeds for
CyberKnife therapy (please see full operative note for details).
 Because of the pt's baseline cardiopulmonary issues, he
remained intubated and was transferred directly to the ICU.

Neuro: He was awake and alert after extubation and was
successfully transitioned to a PCA for pain control.
.
Cardiac: He initially had a Swan-Ganz catheter, which was
removed with stable cardiac function. He was maintained on ASA.
.
Pulmonary: Pt was extubated on POD 2 and eventually transitioned
to O2 by nasal canula.  However, he was electively re-intubated
on [**2-25**] after his wound dehiscence
