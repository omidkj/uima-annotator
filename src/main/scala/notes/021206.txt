Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central line placement
Nasogastric tube placement


History of Present Illness:
57 yo F w/ h/o bipolar d/o, ESRD on HD (initiated 2mos ago),
initially admitted to medicine on [**2177-1-31**] for manic behavior,
recently transferred to psych on [**Hospital1 **] 4 yesterday, who is
transferred now to MICU after PEA arrest while undergoing HD
this afternoon.
.
Per report, while patient was undergoing HD this afternoon she
became hypoxic, then apneic. At approximately 11:20am, patient
went into PEA arrest with a narrow complex rhythm. CPR was
initiated and code blue called. Patient intubated at approx
11:23am. Given 1mg Epi at 11:25am, then 1mg Atropine at 11:30am.
At approx 11:35am, patient regained a pulse (@ 170) and blood
pressure (SBP 170). Patient transferred to the MICU for further
management.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient hypotensive w/ SBP's 70-80's.
Patient bolused total 2L NS. CVP 12-14. K low at 2.5, given
40mEq KCL. Hct down 24.2 --> 21.1. 1u PRBC's ordered. CXR showed
ETT at carina, pulled back 2cm. CXR also w/ bilateral opacities
concerning for aspiration. Cultures drawn, and patient started
on Vanco and Zosyn.
.
Patient's PCP present and informed MICU team of DNR/DNI status.
This DNR/DNI status is documented in OMR from the 2 most recent
d/c summaries dated [**2177-1-8**], and [**2177-2-6**]. Patient's PCP confirms
this status. Also documented in most recent progress notes in
chart.
.
I have contact[**Name (NI) **] patient's mother, and 2 sisters [**Name2 (NI) **] and
[**Name (NI) **]). There is no formal HCP identified. [**Name2 (NI) 6419**] [**Doctor Last Name **] and
[**Doctor First Name **] were unaware of sister's wishes to be DNR/DNI. They were
initially uncomfortable with that status and wished for her to
be full code.  After discussion with the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] family felt
more comfortable and agreed that they would like to uphold the
patient's stated wishes that she would like to be DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
#) PEA arrest/hypotension: Unclear etiology for PEA during
dialysis. reports of hypoxia and apnea suggest this as etiology.
Unclear reason for apnea, possibly [**1-17**] to OSA, seizure or
aspiration event. Hct down to 21 which suggest hypovolemia [**1-17**]
blood loss anemia as possibility, but no obvious sources on
exam. Lytes relatively normal w/ exception of K which was
repleted. Cardiogenic shock unlikely given unchanged EKG. s/p 2L
NS and now giving 1u PRBCs. PE also possible, although less
likley. CXR w/o evidence of pneumothorax, but evidence of
bilateral opacities suggesting aspiration event.  Hypotension
likely cardiac depression s/p arrest.  Echo s/p event w/ normal
LV/RV dysfxn.   Head CT neg for ICH.  s/p 2u PRBCs for low Hct.
CTA neg for PE.  levophed weaned off. Guaiac negative.
Hematocrit and BP remained stable for the remainder of her stay.

.
# Pneumonia: She was treated with 8 days of Zosyn and vancomycin
for suspected aspiration pneumonia. She remain afebrile with
flat WBC and stable respiratory status.
.
# Mental Status:  Patient's mental had not improved several days
after the event. She inconsistently followed commands. Neurology
was consulted to comment on prognosis.  MRI showed no structural
abnormalities.  EEG showed diffuse slowing suggesting mild
encephalopathy and L temporal subcortical and cortical
dysfunction.  The prognosis is unclear as no data is available
to guide determination of prognosis in patient with intact
brainstem function.  Repeat EEG again showed encephalopathy but
no seizure activity.  Her encephalopathy was felt to be most
likely hypoxic encephalopathy with contribution from metabolic
abnormalities.  Her hypercalcemia was thought to possibly be
contributing to her mental status, so she was started on
cinacalcet for secondary hyperparathyroidism.  She continued to
have electrolyte management by hemodialysis.  She will follow up
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Neurology.
.
#) ESRD ON HD: Patient was started on HD approximately 2 mos ago
for renal failure secondary to lithium, with some possible
contribution of hypertensive nephropathy.  She was followed by
Nephrology.  She was maintained on hemodialysis on a MWF
schedule.  She has a L tunnelled HD catheter.
.
#) Bipolar disorder:  Her psychiatric medications were held in
the setting of her neurologic dysfunction.  Psychiatry was
consulted and agreed with this management.  Her future
requirements for psychiatric medications are unclear at this
time.  She will likely need periodic reassessment by Neurology
and possibly Psychiatry.
.
#) Anemia: Likely predominantly secondary to renal failure. She
received 2U PRBC in the period immediately following her cardiac
arrest.  She was guaiac negative and had no signs of hemolysis.
She received epo with dialysis.  Her hematocrit was subsequently
stable.
.
#) Asthma/COPD: Continued on Flovent and atrovent MDI.
.
#) FEN: Started on tube feeds via NG tube.  The family declined
PEG tube as they and the team felt it would not be consistent
with the patient's wishes.  The family requested that the NG
tube be maintained for now.
.
#) Code Status:  Extensive family meetings were held with the
team, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the family regarding the goals of care.  The team
and family agreed to make the patient DNR/DNI after extubation.
Tracheostomy and PEG tube was also felt to be inconsistent with
the patient's wishes.  Given her unclear neurologic prognosis,
the family requested to continue NG tube with tube feeding and
hemodialysis for now, but to maintain DNR/DNI.
