Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**]
Chief Complaint:
Abd Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary hemodialysis catheter placement (now removed)
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
69 yo F with A Fib, hypertension and DM with renal failure s/p
renal transplant presenting with abdominal pain. Day prior to
admission she had acute onset of abdominal pain while in bed.
Pain persisted overnight and worsened the next day so came to
the ED. Denies fever, chills, NS, dysuria, c/p, palpitations,
back pain or other focal complaints.
.
In the ED, intial VS were T98.5, BP 164/78, HR 63, RR 18,
O298%RA, Pain [**8-6**], exam notable for absence of CVA TTP. Labs
notable for absence of WBC's, or LE by UA, INR 6.2 and Cr 3.1
(recent baseline). CT scan of abdomen showed stranding around
the R-kidney. Patient was given morphine 4mg IV x1, and
ciprofloxacin 400mg IV x1 for a possible UTI/pyelonephritis.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was comfortable. She reported
[**8-6**] pain only with movement, but was otherwise comfortable.
.
ROS: + increased abdominal distension, otherwise no change to
bowel habits.
.
ROS: ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.
.
During her hospital course her abdominal pain was felt to be
radicular pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis. In addition, on
[**4-7**] she also developed new bilateral lower extremity weakness
concerning for cauda equina compression given evidence of this
on MRI. Neurology was consulted to evaluate.
.
She also developed altered mental status starting sunday [**4-8**].
Possible causes considered include infection, seizure,
intracranial hemorrahge. She was started on ceftriaxone to treat
for UTI although culture not positive. She had a head CT and
head MRI both of which were unrevealing. Of note her MS did
improved after starting ceftriaxone.
.
She also developed progressive hyponatremia and hyperkalemia as
well as worsening renal failure. K was 6.5 on the day of
transfer to the ICU and she was given kayexalate, 10 units
regular insulin and 1 amp d50.
.
On the day of transfer to the MICU ([**4-9**]) she had a tunnelled
line placed in IR due to lack of access as well as possible need
for dialysis given worsening renal function.

[**2153-4-12**] CXR
New opacity in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac area
suggests
aspiration given the clinical concern. Small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural
effusions are unchanged. Marked cardiomegaly is stable. Left
supraclavicular
catheter is in place. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**2153-4-10**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %) with more significant
hypokinesis of the septum The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2152-10-20**], left ventricular systolic function is now impaired.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The
severity of aortic regurgitation has increased. The other
findings are similar.
.
[**4-10**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and
disorganized background indicative of a mild encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
most
common causes. There are no epileptiform features noted.
.
[**4-9**] CXR: CVL tip at right atrium, no evidence of pneumothorax
or apical hematoma, cardiomegaly still present, interval
development of RLL opacity most likely aspiration or
aspiration/pleural effusion, mild volume overload in perihilar
areas.
.
[**2153-4-8**] MRI Head:
No evidence of acute ischemia. Extensive periventricular white
matter  disease, consistent with small vessel ischemic change
with more defined lacunar-type infarcts also noted. Slight
interval increase in fluid with
