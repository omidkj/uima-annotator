Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2172-8-12**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. with borderline
normal free wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. If clinically
indicated, a TEE would better exclude small valve vegetations
Head CT [**2172-8-11**]:
FINDINGS: A large lobar hemorrhage is again seen in the right
parietal and
temporal lobes. There is an increase in associated edema and
mass effect,
with increased shift of the septum pellucidum and the third
ventricle to the left. There is increased compression of the
right lateral ventricle and increased partial compression of the
third ventricle. Enlargement of the left lateral ventricle
appears stable, may be related to underlying cerebral atrophy,
as the third ventricle is not fully compressed.
There is progressive loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation
in the right posterior temporal and right lateral occipital
lobes, consistent with an evolving acute infarction.
There is an unchanged moderate hypodense subdural collection
along the right convexity, largest along the parietal and
occipital lobes, which is unchanged.
A chronic left frontal infarction is again noted.
There is fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, as
seen on the
previous study, which is commonly seen in intubated patients.
Right mastoid air cells remain partially opacified.
There is a 1.3 cm hyperdense lesion in the right occipital
scalp.

IMPRESSION:
1. Increased edema and mass effect associated with large right
parietal/temporal hematoma, as described above.
2. Evolving acute infarction involving the right posterior
temporal and
lateral occipital lobes, likely in the distribution of the
posterior division of the right middle cerebral artery. Further
evaluation by MRI and MRA may be helpful.
3. Unchanged moderate chronic subdural hematoma along the right
convexity.
FINDINGS:
There is an approximately 42 x 24 mm right temporoparietal
hemorrhage with
surrounding edema, mass effect and midline shift, causing
compression of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle.
Small intraventricular hemorhage in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left
lateral ventricle is noted. There is an approximate midline
shift of 5 mm. There is a chronic right subdural hematoma along
the right parietal and occipital lobes. There is an established
infarct in the right frontoparietal cortex.

There is no bony fracture. There is soft tissue within the right
middle ear which warrants further assessment. There is air-fluid
level in the right maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.

There is an approximately 12 x 8 mm soft tissue focus over the
subcutaneous tissues of the right parieto-occipital bones with a
focus of calcification suggestive of a sebaceous cyst.

CONCLUSION:
1. 42 x 24 mm of acute/subacute right parietotemporal hemorrhage
with
surrounding edema, mass effect and midline shift of
approximately 5 mm.
Attenuation favors some element of aging of blodd products.
Small
intraventricular hemorhage in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left lateral
ventricle.
2. Chronic right subdural hematoma within the right parietal and
temporal
lobes.
3. Established infarct in the left frontoparietal lobe.
4. Soft tissue within the right middle air warrants further
assessment. Air-fluid levels in the right maxillary and sphenoid
sinuses.





Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2172-8-10**]. He had recently
fallen at home while gardening and was admitted to [**Hospital 2586**] Hopsital on [**2172-7-23**] with right parietal SDH. Further
imaging revealed a right IPH as well. The patient was sent to
rehab 2 days prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**]. He became acutely
unresponsive at rehab so he was sent to an outside hospital. He
reportedly had a new IPH as well as the old right SDH so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation. He was
intubated upon arrival and was transferred to the ICU. The
patient had a poor neuro exam while he was in the ICU.
Occassionally he opened his eyes but did not appear to follow
commands. He was able to move his right side spontaneously but
his left side only had minimal withdrawal to pain.

After obtaining CT scan reports from [**Hospital3 **] Hopsital it
was confimed that the patient did not have any new areas of
hemorrhage upon arrival here. He just had the existing right SDH
and IPH. However, upon repeat imaging it appeared that he
continued to have active bleeding in those areas as well as
increasing midline shift and mass effect.

On [**2172-8-12**] his MRI showed possible infarcts in both the right MCA
and PCA territories or possible areas of seizure activity in
those regions. The MRA/MRV were negative for any abnormalities.
He had an Echo which showed no areas of vegetation and a
low-normal EF of 55%. He was also given 2 units of FFP due to an
elevated INR of 1.5. The patient also required vasopressors to
keep his blood pressure up. He was febrile.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] talked to both daughters in the morning of
[**2172-8-12**] to discuss trach placement and at that time they were not
sure and wanted some time to think about it. Later that day they
came and and we had a family meeting with neurology, palliative
care, and the ICU team
