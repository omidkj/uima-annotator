Chief Complaint:
Elective TKR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LEFT TOTAL KNEE REPLACMENT


History of Present Illness:
58-year-old woman with h/o nonischemic cardiomyopathy with
severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 20%), s/p ICD implantation,
DM, RA and obesity presenting s/p L knee TKR.  The patient is
s/p L knee arthroscopy in [**1-12**] which showed L meniscal tear,
severe tricompartmental RA and partial ACL tear s/p L
menisectomy.  Following the surgery, she continued to have L
knee pain, and presented today for elective L TKR.  She has a
long history of severe nonischemic CHF possibly [**3-12**] heavy
cocaine and alcohol abuse and viral myocarditis in the past as
well as an EF of 20%.  A TTE in [**4-13**] showed mild symmetric LVH
with mild TR.  A Cath in [**10-12**] showed 1v disease of her D1 and
D2, elevated R and L heart pressures with moderate pulm htn, and
a small L to R intracardiac shunt at the high right atrial
level.  She is followed closely in the heart failure clinic with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who felt that she would be unable
to tolerate the surgery with minimal increased ischemic risk.
She presents to the ICU s/p L TKR.  In the OR, she had an
estimated blood loss of 100 cc and received 900 cc of
crystalloid.


Past Medical History:
- RA
- Grave's, now hypothyroid
- DM. Diagnosed [**2103**]
- CHF. Unknown cause, possibly d/t heavy cocaine and alcohol
abuse for 15 years as well as possible viral myocarditis.
- Status post ICD in [**3-/2110**] for nonsustained VT
- Hyperlipidemia
- s/p Tubal ligation
- s/p CCY
- h/o Diverticulosis
- Obesity
- Perimenopausal

UNILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: The examination is
extremely limited as overlying surgical material precludes
evaluation of the distal superficial femoral vein and popliteal
vein. Grayscale, color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the common
femoral and proximal portion of the superficial femoral veins
demonstrate normal compressibility, waveforms, color flow, and

The patient is status post placement of three-component knee
prosthesis, in overall anatomic alignment. Soft tissue changes
consistent with surgery are noted. Calcification anterior to the
distal femur is noted. No radiopaque foreign body is detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
58-year-old woman nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe LV
systolic dysfunction (EF 20%) admitted for elective total knee
replacement for osteoarthritis.  Hospital course outlined by
problem:

# TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT: Underwent the procedure without
complications. Observed in the ICU postoperatively becasue of
history of severe left sided heart failure. Minimal blood loss
and no complications intaoperatively. Plain film showed good
placement and alignment of porsthesis. The drain was pulled on
POD 3.  She received perioperative antibiotics. Seen by physical
therapy. Pain well controlled with narcotics and NSAIDs.
AFebrile with good incision. She should be seen in the
orthopedic clinic to have her staples removed on [**6-16**]. She
will then be reevaluated at that point as well for further ortho
care.  She will need at least 3 weeks of lovenox for DVT
prophylaxis in the setting of her total knee replacement.
Weight bearing staus as outlined by physical therapy and ortho.

.

# HYPOTENSION: Had a single episode of low BP to the 80's once
while being monitored in the ICU. She was asymptomatic.  She was
never hypoxic.  EKG showed no ongoing ischemia. LENI showed no
DVT. She had received more beta blocker than usual. She was
given 500-1000cc normal saline with good response and maintained
her blood pressure thereafter. Felt to be related to being dry
postoperatively with an increase in her beta blocker.

.
## DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2: Home meds include 35units lantus
and a sliding scale for covering meals.  She had elevated sugars
postoperatively in the absence of any steroids of suspicion of
infection.  Likely due to her operation. Her lantus was
increased to 65 units daily and her sliding scale was increased
as well. She continues to have blood glucose levels in the mid
200's. She should see her outpatient endocrinologist at the
[**Hospital **] Clinic when she leaves the rehab.  I anticipate her
sugars will decrease over time but her sliding scale will need
to be adjusted in the interem to facilitate good wound healing
and decrease infectious complications.
