Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, angina, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated, Extubated


History of Present Illness:
57yo gentleman with h/o CAD s/p 2 MIs, renal transplant [**5-/2154**]
for Wegener's granulomatosis, HTN, dyslipidemia, and paroxysmal
AFib p/w accelerating angina. He c/o pain in his jaw, which then
moves to his throat and then the middle of his chest; feels like
pressure. Symptoms are provoked by activity and associated with
dyspnea. Patient states that symptoms began a few months ago and
have been worsening in the sense that they come on with less
stimulus (now just with walking across the room) and only
resolve with nitro. He also reports feeling exhausted. He has
had a cough productive of large amounts of white sputum x 1
week. +sinus congestion, which he reports feeling like it is
dripping down the back of his throat and collecting in his
lungs. He also notes subjective fevers at home and nausea with
episode of non-bloody emesis in the ED. He has had diarrhea
about 5 times a day, "like minestrone soup." He denies sore
throat, abdominal pain, or dysuria, and he only gets headaches
when he takes the nitroglycerin. Of note, he does endorse PND
and orthopnea as well as ankle edema. He reports 10 pounds of
weight gain in the last week.
.
In the ED, his VS were 100.7, Tmax 102 89 120/68 18 97% RA. He
was given ASA 325mg and Tylenol 650mg as well as Metoprolol 5mg
IV. Levaquin 750mg po was administered at 16:00 for concern of
pneumonia. EKG showed ST depression in V4-V6 as well as I and
aVL and upsloping ST elevation in V1 and V2. Troponin was 0.27
(last Trop 0.04 in [**10-22**]). Patient was evaluated by the
cardiology fellow, and a heparin gtt was ordered, but not
started per nursing notes. Patient was also seen by transplant
nephrology fellow.

Pertinent Results:
LABORATORY DATA:
CK 198 Troponin 0.27
CK-MB 4
Hct 25
Cr 2.3
.
EKG demonstrated NSR with old Q wave in V3 but new ST
depressions in V5-V6 and I, aVL as well as ST elevations in V1
and V2 as compared with prior dated [**2154-7-25**].
.
CXR [**10-10**]:
TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There are slight increased patchy
opacities in the right lower lobe, which is seen to project
posteriorly on the lateral view. This may represent an
early/developing pneumonia. The left lung is clear. The aorta is
tortuous. Small Kerley B lines suggest mild interstitial edema.
The bony thorax is normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Possible early/developing right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Mild interstitial edema.
.
Echo [**10-11**]:
The left atrium and right atrium is moderately dilated. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect.Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral
walls and distal lateral and anterior walls. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary
muscle dysfunction. Secundum type atrial septal defect. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hyertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-10-31**],
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive
(now involving the basal inferior and inferolateral walls), the
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased, and pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension is now identified. The secundum
type atrial septal defect is now better defined.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**10-13**])
FINDINGS: Limited grayscale images of the abdomen do not detect
ascites and limited views of the liver suggest normal
echotexture.
IMPRESSION: No ascites.
.
CXR [**10-13**]:
Increased airspace disease is evident by progressive increasing
density of the bilateral consolidations, the left now clearly
expressing itself as such. There is a subtle motion degradation
though lateral costophrenic sulci are still reasonably
delineated. Heart size is enlarged.
IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease bilaterally for which
bilateral
pneumonias most fitting.
.
ABDOMINAL FILM ON [**2154-10-13**]
INDICATION: Abdominal distention, increased dyspnea and
difficulty breathing.
A single view of the abdomen shows nonspecific non-obstructed
bowel gas
pattern with predominantly gas-filled large bowel visualized.
The appearance is quite similar to a remote prior abdominal film
from [**2154-5-21**]. On the current study, the
