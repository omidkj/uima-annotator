HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an unfortunate
56-year-old male smoker with no significant past medical
history who presented to a hospital in [**State **] in [**Month (only) **] of
this year for complaint of abdominal distention and weight
loss.  Patient was found to be jaundiced and underwent an
abdominal CT scan which showed multiple abdominal masses from
the posterior aspect to the stomach to the spleen and also
tail of the pancreas, plus lymphadenopathy and likely liver
metastases.

The patient was briefly hospitalized in [**State **] for mental
status changes, but after hydration, returned to baseline
mentation and left against medical advice to travel to [**Location (un) 86**]
to seek appropriate medical care.  The patient traveled on a
bus with his sister, who is very involved in his care for 23
hours, and when arriving in [**Location (un) 86**], was weak and unable to
ambulate.  Patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 **]
Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was minimally
responsive.  Temperature of 95.7, blood pressure of 100/65,
pulse of 105, sating of 95% on 3 liters and 89% on room air.
He had a chest x-ray showing a right lower lobe infiltrate.
Was started on levo and Flagyl, and he had a VQ scan that was
intermediate probability for pulmonary embolus.  He had a
head MRI which was negative for lesions, and he was started
on Heparin for question of pulmonary embolus given the high
clinical suspicion.  He was also given Narcan as there had
been some question of narcotics given at the outside hospital
and had minimal improvement in mental status.

The morning of transfer to the MICU, the patient was found by
his floor team with a blood pressure of 80/45, 93% on 2
liters nasal cannula.  Was given 2 liters of normal saline
bolus with improvement of blood pressure to the 90s with
saturations which dropped to the low 90s on 7 liters face
mask.  The patient again became minimally responsive and had
no change in mental status with Narcan administration.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's only medication on admission was
Vicodin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced with two young
children.  He has a 65 pack year tobacco history.  No history
of alcohol or IV drug use.  The patient has large extended
and very involved family.

On transfer to the MICU, the patient's temperature is 95.0,
blood pressure of 93/60, pulse of 105, and sating of 93% on 7
liters face mask.  In general, he is uncomfortable with
orientation only to self.  HEENT revealed anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  Jugular venous distention at about 7 cm.  Chest:  The
patient was using accessory muscles to breathe, had
diminished breath sounds at the right base, and bronchial
breath sounds throughout.  Cardiovascular examination was
notable for being tachycardic.  Abdomen:  It was soft and
distended.  He did have hepatomegaly and normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities: The patient had 2+ edema bilateral
lower extremities that was taught with weeping skin, however,
his extremities were warm with adequate capillary refill.
Neurologically, the patient was moving all four extremities
spontaneously and could follow simple commands.

Patient's white count on admission was 12.0, hematocrit 42.9,
platelets 168.  The patient had an INR of 2.9, PTT of greater
than 150.  Patient's electrolytes were notable for a BUN of
105 and a creatinine of 2.3.  Patient's LFTs were grossly
elevated as well.  He had an ALT of 154 and AST of 427, and
LD of 993, and alkaline phosphatase of 735, and a T bilirubin
of 3.1.

Given the concern for pulmonary embolus, the patient had an
echocardiogram which showed no evidence of right ventricular
dysfunction.  Patient's urinalysis was unremarkable.

In short, this is a 56-year-old man with reported abdominal
mass diagnosed on CT scan at outside hospital presenting here
with change in mental status, hypoxic, acute renal failure,
infiltrate on chest x-ray, and hypotension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated
as needed, and started on dopamine.  The patient required
intubation to support his ventilation during this time.
Patient was also started on stress dosed steroids and
broad-spectrum antibiotics given concern for sepsis or
possible adrenal insufficiency.  Despite aggressive
intervention, the patient's clinical status continued to
deteriorate.  The patient's acute renal failure worsened, and
he continued to space fluids.

Patient developed marked ascites, which was thought to be
likely to metastatic disease in his belly.  He had a
diagnostic tap done which was consistent with spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis, however, no cultures ever grew from
this.  Patient's cytology from this tap was negative as well.
Patient's family understood his poor prognosis, however,
patient had stated a clear wish to continue being intubated
until passing away, and not to be disconnected from any
life-support measures, plus patient was made CPR not
indicated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Patient was supported with fluids
and pressors.  Unfortunately, his coagulopathy and renal
failure continued to worsen and despite fluid, pressors, and
ventilatory support, the patient because bradycardic, and
finally arrested on the morning of [**2200-12-20**].

Patient was pronounced at 9:40 am on [**2200-12-20**].  Family was
notified and postmortem examination was arranged for.
