Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo F non-compliant s/p recent AMA d/c from MICU w/ central
line in place p/w with questionable seizure and DKA.  Pt is
leaving AMA, and she understands that her anion gap metabolic
acidosis and elevated K pose serious medical risks to her life.

1. DKA: Pt was admitted to the MICU on [**2204-6-16**] for DKA,
lethargy, lightheadedness, and sense that she is going to have a
seizure.  Possible precipitant(s) of DKA include non-compliance
with insulin regimen vs. infection [**1-4**] sz -> aspiration
pneumonia (RML opacity on CXR, poor dentition) vs. line
bacteremia (pt w/ central line in place when left AMA on
previous admission) vs. ischemia vs. other infection (peritoneal
fluid from PD, urine) (Pregnancy r/o w/ negative B-HCG on
presentation).
.
Pt was treated with DKA protocol, Levo/Flagyl for possible
aspiration pneumonia.  Successfully decreased BS, closure of AG
to baseline (15), and improved mentation and PO intake on
Insulin gtt and was changed to sub-cutaneous insulin regimen
(Lantus 30units qd and Humolog ISS) with [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes consult
pending.  Levo/Flagyl was discontinued on HD #2 due to pt's lack
of WBC, afebrile, and rpt CXR showing no infiltrate.  Upon
leaving ICU, blood cxs NGTD, troponin elevated @ 0.37, but
decreased from previous level of 0.46 ([**5-31**]) - therefore likely
trending downward slowly [**1-4**] ESRD and no evidence of active
ischemia, PD fluid w/out signs of infection, urine cx skin flora
only. Increased AM Humalog to 12 U standing, with modified
Humalog SS; lantus was kept at 35 U qHS, as her AM FSBS were
100-150s.
.
2. Seizure: Poorly defined seizure dz, thought to be primary vs
secondary to hypoglycemia. Never seen by neuro svc, and missed
last appt with next appt set for [**7-6**]. Head CT on last admission
negative. Last neuro note suggests ?metabolic-toxic cause
(uremia/metabolic derangements). H/o subdural (?[**1-4**] seizure).
Unclear how long she has been on AEDs.  Pt was without sz
activity in hospital ICU stay, and was maintained on Keppra,
Neurontin. Pre-approval forms had previously been filed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Hospital1 18**] PCP). Patient's pharmacy was [**Hospital1 653**] to
fill keppra and neurontin. Patient was also advised not to
drive, given seizure disorder.
.
3. [**Name (NI) 2793**]: Patient on CAPD 5x/day 2L x 3 hrs dwelling with D2.5
w/Ca-acetate solution. Details of peritoneal dialysis reviewed
with [**Name (NI) **] service, who felt that 4x/day would be adequate
dialysis, but did not object to her current regimen. Patient has
requested transition to CCPD at PM, and [**Name (NI) **] service requested
24 hr collection for Cre and urea before consideration of
transitioning patient to CCPD.
.
4. CV: Last [**Name (NI) 113**] w/EF 75%, no WMA, moderate AS (1.6 cm2)
w/evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Peaking T in V3 on
presentation to clinic prior to hospitalization,
pseudonormalization in V1, otherwise no new changes.  On
admission, with normalization of potassium, pt no longer with
peaked T.  Trop elevated on admission to 0.37, but trending w/
previous values shows downward trend w/ peak at 0.46 on [**5-31**]
(slow clearance due to poor [**Month/Year (2) **] clearance).  Pt maintained on
statin and BB (no ASA [**1-4**] allergy of vomiting and GI upset).
Zestril held [**1-4**] pt's recent elevated potassium.  Added back
procardia per outpatient
