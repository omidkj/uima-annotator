[**2110-5-9**]: Sinus tachycardia. There is a late transition with tiny
R waves in the anterior leads consistent with possible prior
anterior wall myocardial infarction. Minimal ST segment
elevation in the inferior leads consistent with possible
ischemia or infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Compared to the previous tracing left ventricular hypertrophy is
no longer apparent and ST segment elevation is new.
.
[**2110-5-9**] AXR: Fidnings suggestive of mild partial or early small
bowel obstruction. If clinically indicated, continued monitoring
is advised.
.
[**2110-5-9**] CXR: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
.
[**2110-5-10**] Echo: Mild left ventricular cavity enlargement with
moderate global hypokinesis suggestive of a diffuse process
(toxin, metabolic, etc. - though cannot fully exclude
multivessel CAD).
.
[**2110-5-9**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Late
transition with tiny R waves in the anterior leads consistent
with possible prior anterior wall myocardial infarction. Minimal
ST segment elevation in the inferior leads with diffuse ST-T
wave changes consistent with possible ischemia or infarction.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
[**2110-5-9**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Probable left ventricular
hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2110-5-9**] no change.
.
[**2110-5-10**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing the
rate is slower.
.
[**2110-5-11**] CXR: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing the
rate is slower.
.
[**2110-5-11**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Occasional atrial premature beats.
Leftward axis. Intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-5-10**]
atrial ectopy is new. The QRS duration is similar.
.
[**2110-5-12**] CXR: Consolidation in the left lower lobe, not
significantly changed since the prior radiographs.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old man with diabetes, hypertension,
and hyperlipidemia, who presented with fever, nausea, and
vomiting, and who was found to be in DKA with infiltrate on CXR,
now positive for Legionella. His brief hospital course, by
problem:
.
#) Pneumonia. Urinary Legionella antigen positive, treated
empirically for CAP for 3 days with levofloxacin. Afebrile,
leukocytosis resolved, satting well on room air. CXR showed that
pneumonia unchanged. He was given a total 14-day course of
levofloxacin.
.
#) NSTEMI. Subendocardial ischemia in the setting of acute
demand from difficult-to-control hypertension/fever/pneumonia.
Non-specific EKG changes. Enzymes trending down.  He will get a
P-MIBI once pneumonia has resolved and blood pressure is better
controlled; it was schedule
