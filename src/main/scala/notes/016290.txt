Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
64 M with history of HTN, HL, CAD, MI s/p DES presents with
worsening fatigue, CP, and DOE x 1 month. The shortness of
breath has worsened over the last few weeks, getting symptomatic
now when walking up stairs. He also experiences some associated
chest tightness and has an intermittent cough productive of
white sputum. Otherwise denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.
ROS also positive for 20 lb weight loss over the last few
months.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.6 76 117/65 16 100%. Initial concern
was for PE. D-dimer was in the 4000s, so CTA was obtained which
was negative for PE, but found moderate pericardial effusion.
Cardiology evaluated the patient using bedside echo which showed
that there was no signs of right atrial or ventricular diastolic
collapse. Chronicity of this effusion is slightly unclear and so
decision was made to admit patient to cardiology service for
further monitoring. Morphine was not helpful in relieving
patient's chest discomfort, however toradol was. Vitals prior to
transfer to the floor were: 98.9 82 135/85 18 95% RA.
.
Currently, patient feels much better, still having very light
chest discomfort but otherwise is resting comfortably, not
having any difficulties with breathing

CXR ([**2156-10-29**]):
The lungs are clear bilaterally with no areas of focal
consolidation. Small nodular densities overlying the left fifth
rib are again noted most consistent with bone islands as seen on
the prior chest radiographs with obliques. There are no areas of
focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild cardiomegaly. The
mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, which is new since [**2155-1-27**]
study. No
evidence of pneumonia.
.
CTA ([**2156-10-29**]):
1. Moderate-sized pericardial effusion with faint enhancement of
the
pericardium. Pericarditis cannot be excluded.
2. No pulmonary embolism.
3. Moderate centrilobular emphysema. Multiple small pulmonary
nodules
measuring up to 3 mm. Followup chest CT in 12 months is
recommended.
.
TTE ([**2156-10-30**]):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
with RV normal free wall contractility. No mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion
posteriorly (1.9cm) and small anterior effusion (0.9cm). No
right atrial diastolic collapse is seen. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen.
.
TTE ([**2156-10-30**]):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
After pericardiocentesis there is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Successful pericardiocentesis. Trivial residual
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
TTE ([**2156-10-31**]):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a very small anterior pericardial effusion. There is a
larger focal pericardial vs. pleurial effusion posteriorly.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Small residual pericardial effusion. There is an
echolucent space near the left atrium that is probably a small
pleural effusion. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-30**] the
findings are similar.
.
TTE ([**2156-11-1**]):
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements.

IMPRESSION: Very small partiall echo filled pericardial effusion
with abnormal septal motion. No hemodynamic compromise, but the
abnormal septal motion raises the possibility of early
constriction. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-31**], the findings are
similar (PA hypertension is now identified).
.
TTE ([**2156-11-3**]):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is abnormal septal motion/position. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-11-1**],
the septal "bounce" is not as apparent on the current study. The
other findings are similar.
.
Pericardial Fluid Cytology ([**2156-10-30**]):
Rare atypical cells, cannot exclude reactive mesothelial cells.
.
Pericardial Fluid Cell Block ([**2156-10-30**]):
