Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Orthopnea with new onset of atrial fibrillation, abnormal stress
test

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-5-8**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 (Left internal
thoracic artery to the first diagonal coronary artery, reverse
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery,
reversed saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the
posterolateral branch, and reversed saphenous vein single graft
from the aorta to the obtuse marginal). Resection of left atrial

[**2105-5-4**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr.[**Known lastname 284**] is a very nice 76 year-old gentleman with prior
history of hypertension, s/p MI and coronary angioplasty in
[**2091**]. He has been chest pain free but reports orthopnea that
started 1-2 months ago. He now uses 2 pillows, has awakened in
the middle of the night due to cough, but denies SOB.  A stress
test was done for further evaluation. He had a positive result,
was also noted to be in new onset atrial fibrillation, and his
internist referred him for Cardiac catheterization. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
was consulted for coronary revascularization.


Past Medical History:
MI in [**2090**]

He is married with two grown children. He does not smoke. He
rarely drinks alcohol. He denies any illegal substance use. He
is semi-retired in public relations.

Pertinent Results:
Stress Test [**2105-4-30**]:
IMPRESSION: Poor exercise tolerance and marked drop in exercise
tolerance from ETT in [**2101**]. Test terminated secondary to
hypotensive
blood pressure response to exercise low level exercise. Ischemic
ECG
changes in the absence of typical anginal symptoms with
nonspecific ST
segment changes. Nuclear report sent separately.
.
Cardiac Perfusion [**2105-4-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
New small, fixed, moderate apical and distal septal defect
correlating with
reversible abnormality on the prior study but with normal LV
cavity size and
preserved ejection fraction of 63%.
.
Cardiac cath [**2105-5-4**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
diffuse
three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no lesions.
The LAD
had a 40% stenosis in the proximal segment and 90-100% lesions
in the
mid segment. The LAD recanalized in the distal portion which was

diffusely diseased. The diagonal branch had a 90% origin
stenosis.
The LCx was diffusely diseased with a tubular and beaded 90%
lesion
leading to a large OM2. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the mid
segment
and a 70% stenosis in the distal vessel. The PDA was occluded,
but
appeared to have faint anterograde flow. The proximal RPL had a
70%
stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right
and left
sided filling pressures (RVEDP 20 mm Hg, LVEDP 26 mm Hg). The
PCWP mean
was moderately elevated at 31 mm Hg. There was moderate
pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PASP 51 mm Hg). The systemic arterial
blood
pressure was mildly elevated (SBP 140 mm Hg). There was no
gradient upon
pullback of the catheter from the LV to the aorta. The cardiac
index was
low-normal at 2.4 l/min/m2. The systemic and pulmonary vascular
resistances were normal (1433 and 83 dynes-sec/cm5,
respectively). There
was no evidence of restrictive or constrictive physiology. There
was no
evidence of intracardiac shunt by oximetry.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated low-normal LV function (EF
50%)
and moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3. Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
.
CXR PA/lat [**2105-5-4**]:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of
prior chest
radiographs:
Mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by a pectus deformity. Main and
hilar
pulmonary arteries are not enlarged and pulmonary vascularity
generally is not engorged. There is a small volume of right
pleural fluid. Lungs are clear.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
Carotid series [**2105-5-5**]:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2105-5-5**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of recent infection, malignancy, or
overhydration.
Numerically increased, but morphologically normal lymph nodes.
Aortic and
coronary calcifications. Uncharacteristic scars in the lung
parenchyma, no
recent infection. Even pleural surfaces. Moderate dilatation of
the upper
esophagus.
