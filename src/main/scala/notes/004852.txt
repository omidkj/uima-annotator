Brief Hospital Course:
Pt [**Name (NI) 12081**] is a 25 yo male s/p traumatic reported 9 story fall
who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-11-21**]. Pt was found on ground in
front of dorm and was conscious. At the ED the patient was able
to answer simple questions and was moving his upper extremities.
He was electively intubated due to combativeness and for airway
protection. He was resuscitated and underwent radiologic imaging
which showed multiple injuries. Including, a small parietal hem
L med temporal & L med occiciptal lobes, a right parafalcine
subdural hematoma, a right occipital subarachnoid hemmorrhage.
He also sustained a C1 fracture with the right lateral mass tx
fx to anterior arch, posterior fracture through the posterior
arch, and a C2 teardrop fracture involving the anterior inferior
body.  Mr. [**Known lastname 111**] had a fracture of the C4 transferse process
that was unstable and a T7 spinous process fracture. T8
sustained injuries to the lamina bilaterally and right inferior
facet, with T9 fracture to teh superior endplate. He also was
noted to have multiple rib fractures and a complete L2 vertebral
body burst fracture with 100 percent displacement and 50 percent
lateral displacement of L1 on L3. His L1 left lamina was
fractured along with bilateral transverse process fractures at
the same level. L3 was noted to have a spinous process fracture.
Mr. [**Known lastname 111**] had a small right pneumothorax and a comminuted
sternal fracture with anterior mediastinal hematoma without
aortic injury. There were bilateral psoas hematomas and a
retroperitoneal hematoma. He also sustained a comminuted,
impacted nasal fracture that transected the septum and a lefort
II fracture with bilateral maxillary sinus hematomas. He had a
transverse, nondisplaced fracture of his hard palate. He also
had a right pulmonary contusion with atelectasis and two anal
tears.
   The patient was transfered to TSICU for further care and
consults were called of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery spine, and
plastic Surgery.
     On [**11-25**] the patient underwent repair of spinal
fracture/dislocation: 1.  Reduction of L2-L3 fracture under
general anesthesia,2.  Instrumentation from T11 to L4, 3.
Arthrodesis T11 to L4, 4.  Harvesting of right iliac crest graft
through a separate fascial incision. Prior to neurosurgical
reduction an IVC filter was placed by trauma service.
     The patient was extubated successfully on [**2115-11-27**]. On
[**2115-12-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 111**] returned to the OR for ORIF of his facial
fractures and placement of a trach and PEG.
He was transferred to the floor on [**2115-12-8**], where he continued
to receive aggressive physical, occupational, and respiratory
therapy. His trach tube was downsized without difficulty on
[**12-15**] and on [**2115-12-16**] he underwent successful decannulation.
     Throughout his stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 111**] was followed by inpatient
psychiatry who felt that he had persistent suicidal ideations
