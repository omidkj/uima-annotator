Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 65686**]
Chief Complaint:
new left hemianopsia with cerbral hemorrheage and edema admitted
to ICU for medical management

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter

History of Present Illness:
64 year old male with metastatic renal cell to brain, spine,
larynx, liver and lung, s/p avastin, recurrent pulmonary emboli
on lovenox, presented to the ED with worsening right sided
visual field loss. He reports intermittant blurry vision and
flashes of light accompanied by headaches x 2 1/2 weeks with
worsening symptoms over the past 6 days. Three days ago he had
severe bitemporal headache which he describes as [**5-12**] and
throbbing. Around the same time, he noted right sided
hemianopsia with "psychadelic" flashes of light and colors. On
the day of admission, he presented to an opthalmologist who
performed a dialated exam and determined that his vision loss
was not related to a primary occular lesion and recommended
presentation to the ED.
.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.3 71 143/102 22 99%. He was
AAOx3, exam notible for right hemianopsia. CT head showed
progression of known left occipital/parietal mass with worsening
hemorrheage and edema (compared with MRI [**12-13**]. labs notible for
Na 129, Cr 1.4 (baseline 1.3), WBC 5.6 75% PMN, INR 1.1.
Neurosurgery was consulted who recommended blood pressure
control and FFP but did not recommend surgery or seizure
prophylaxis. Patient was given dexamethasone 10mg IV and 2 units
FFP and furosemide 20mg IV. 2 PIV. Vitals on transfer p68
bp136/88 sao2 96% on RA.
.
Upon arrival to ICU, patient reported [**2-9**] bifrontal headache
and continued right hemianopsia. He reported word finding
difficulites and short term memory loss over the past weeks to
months.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) increased hemoptysis in last week, and increased respiratory
secretions

instability, muscle weakness.Denies fever, chills, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied shortness of breath. Denied chest pain.
