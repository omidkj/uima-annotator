Chief Complaint:
Heel ulcer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This was a 75yo F with past medical history of CKD, diabetes
mellitus, and presumed PVD who presented with worsening right
foot pain.  She reported that five days prior to arrival she had
cut her right heel with her fingernail while removing a
stocking.  The area of the cut began to get progressively
painful and she began to have clear drainage from the area.  She
denied any fever, purulence, or motor/sensory defects.
Nevertheless, progress pain led symptoms to interfere with her
ADL's as she has been dependent on a right foot/ankle brace
since her CVA and she was unable to wear this due to pain.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.2, P 56, BP 140/38, RR 18,
O2 99%RA.  On physical exam a well defined area of erythema was
noted on R heel, as circular abrasion over lat aspect of R 5th
toe.  Pulses were dopplerable.  Labs were notable for WCC 14.0,
Hct 29.1 (baseline), Cr 2.1 (baseilne 1.2-1.6), lactate of 2.1.
Heel XR did not demonstrate signs c/w osteomyelitis. Podiatry
was consulted and recommended admission for IV antibiotics and
vascular work-up.  Patient was given 1g IV vancomycin and
admitted to medicine.  Vitals prior to transfer were 97.0 hr 56
146/50 20 100%.

On arrival to the floor, patient's vital signs were 95.7 195/47
62 18 100%RA.  On review of systems, she denied fever, chills,
night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion,
sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

RADIOLOGY RESULTS
==================
Chest Radiograph [**2196-5-28**]:
FINDINGS: Support and monitoring devices are in standard
position, and
cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Multifocal poorly
defined nodules are again demonstrated in both lungs,
co-existing with coalescent areas of airspace opacity in the
perihilar and basilar regions. The latter have slightly improved
on the left but worsened on the right. The nodules are
consistent with an infectious etiology including fungal
organisms and septic emboli. The more confluent airspace
opacities could either be due to infection or co-existing
pulmonary edema. Left pleural effusion is small and not
appreciably changed.

R foot XR [**2196-5-18**]
1. No radiographic evidence of soft tissue ulcer or subcutaneous
edema.
2. Intact cortex surrounding the calcaneus without evidence of
acute
osteomyelitis. If clinical concern persists, suggest MRI or
nuclear medicine bone scan.

CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS [**2196-5-19**]
1. Extensive atherosclerotic vascular disease with
mild-to-moderate bilateral
CFA stenosis, multifocal areas of narrowing in the bilateral SFA
and right
popliteal artery, and segment of moderate to severe narrowing in
the left
popliteal artery with patent bilateral three-vessel runoff.
2. Multiple subcutaneous fluid collections overlying the right
kidney.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
4. Left adrenal hyperplasia.
5. 3.1 cm possibly septated ovarian cyst. Given the patient's
age further
evaluation by MRI is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
This was a 75 y.o. female with DM, CKD, and PVD presenting with
right heel cellulitis and with course complicated by aspiration
pneumonia/pneumonitis and anuric acute renal failure.

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient developed increasing
oxygen requirement over hospital stay which was initially
thought to be due to volume overload in the context of holding
furosemide.  She subsequently developed productive cough and
worsening hypoxia that continued to worsen despite
vanc/tigecycline/ and ciprofloxacin empiric treatment for
pneumonia.  She was intubated with sputum cultures showing
multiple specise consistent with aspiration.   She had an
esophageal balloon placed for help titrating PEEP but continued
to be hypoxic requiring 100% FiO2 at the time of her terminal
extubation on [**2196-5-28**].  Shortly after extubation the patient
become bradycardic and then asystolic.  Family came to bedside.
Autopsy refused.

2) Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient initially
presented with Cr 2.1 from 1.2-1.5 at baseline but quickly
improved with holding diuretics but unfortunately she developed
contrast induced nephropathy and anuric renal failure.  Given
rising K and anuria discussion was had with the family on the
evening of [**5-27**] and the morning of [**5-28**] about initiating renal
replacement therapy.  They did not feel she would want this
intervention given multiple other abnormalities and low
likelihood to return to previous standard of life.
Therefore,she was terminally extubated and passed away soon
afterward.

3) PVD/ Likely rhabdo: In the context of being intubated and
severe hypoxemia the patient's CK went to 20,000+ in the setting
of progressive renal failure suggestive of rhabdomyolysis.
Given very poor peripheral flow this was thought due to ischemia
due to PVD in the context of hypotension.  Vascular was
consulted but patient was not stable enough for procedure and
given ultimate dismal prognosis she was extubated.

4)Cellulitis: Patient w R heel abrasion p/w localized
cellulitis.  No signs of more serious infection on labs,
imaging.  Pt received 5d doxycycline w improvement in WBC count
and redness.  PVD likely contributing factor.

5) HTN: Patoent on multidrug outpatient regimen with poor
baseline control (SBP 150s).  Her losartan was stopped at admit
given kidney injury.  Other anti-hypertensive were stopped
around [**5-20**] as the patient's clinical status deteriorated.

chronic kidney disease.  She was at her baseline Hct.  Continued
