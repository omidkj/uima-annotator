History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 15942**] is well-known to the
transplant surgery service.  Briefly, he is a 68 year-old male
who is s/p OLT [**8-/2104**] with ESRD on HD who was recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] for a GI bleed and discharged 4 days prior.  During his
previous admission, he underwent EGD and colonoscopy that did
not
show a source of bleeding.  He did not have any episodes of
bloody stools while he was in the hospital and was transfused a
total of 1 unit PRBC.  He did have episodes of diarrhea but was
C.Diff negative x 3.  Furthermore, he is s/p a PEG tube [**3-/2106**]
and has been getting tube feeds at home.  Per his wife, he awoke
this AM (~530AM) and had one episode of bloody BM.  By
approximately 930AM, he had a total of 4 bloody BMs, unknown
quantity.  He presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and was found to
have a hematocrit of 20.  He was transfused one unit of PRBC and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **].

In the emergency room, his repeat hematocrit was 26.0 after his
transfusion.  He has been hemodynamically stable without signs
of
hypotension.  Gastroenterology evaluated him and plans for a EGD
given the coffee ground drainage from his PEG tube.

Brief Hospital Course:
68M s/p OLT, ESRD on HD s/p PEG with GI bleed, likely from an
upper GI source. He was admitted to SICU on the Transplant
Service. He was kept NPO and given 2 units of PRBC. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed and EGD noting the following:  a single oozing ulcer
was found in the superior fornyx of the duodenal bulb. There was
a large adherent red clot (1-2cm); the base could not be
visualized. One triclip was successfully applied for the purpose
of hemostasis. 3 1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were
applied for hemostasis with success. Otherwise normal EGD to
third part of the duodenum
Recommendations included a PPI drip x 72 hours then PO BID until
repeat EGD in 6 weeks. Hct remained stable and he as transferred
out of the SICU. Of note, H.pylori testing on [**1-25**] was
negative.

On [**1-25**], Hct dropped from 27 to 25. 2 units of PRBC were given.
Hct then remained stable. He continued to have 8 BMs/day. Diet
was resumed on [**1-26**] as well as tube feeds. Imodium was started.
BMs slowed down and were not bloody. These were well tolerated
without further GI bleeding. Hct remained stable.

Hemodialysis was performed on [**1-27**] without incident. Protonix
drip was switched to prilosec [**Hospital1 **]. CVL was removed and he was
discharged to home.

Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] (Heme/Onc)was rescheduled to [**2-1**].
