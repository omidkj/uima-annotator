Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
Small bowel obstruction & sepsis [**1-26**] pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old male with history of severe PD, mild
cognitive impairment, COPD and HTN who presents with 12 hours of
abdominal pain and vomiting of 1000cc of black emesis.

He was in his USOH until one day PTA when he complained of some
abdominal pain and lack of appetite.  Later that night he was
discovered to have black (coffee ground?) emesis on his chest.
He was brought to an OSH where there were no ICU beds available,
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  On arrial O2 sat was 85% RA, he was
in some respiraory distress, lactate was 4.7, creatinine 2.6,
normal wbc with 48% bands, BCx taken, EKG done, CT scan of the
abdomen without contrast was performed, he was intubated for CT
scan then extubated. Final read of CT scan showed small bowel
obstruction.  Also had a patchy opacity at the right base.
Given Cefepime, Vanco and Flagyl.  Received 4mg IV morphine.  He
was given IV PPI for UGIB.   Surgery evaluated the patient and
diagnosed him with small bowel ischemia.  The patient's daughter
and daughter in law are both physicians, understood his poor
prognosis and made the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].  Several hours later upon
learning of the final radiology read of the CT abdomen which did
not see evidence of bowel ischemia, the family wanted the
patient to be reassessed and code status was reversed.

After much discussion with the surgical team, medical team, and
medical ICU team, the family had decided to opt for medical
management, and forgo future surgical procedures.  He was made
DNR/DNI with the plan to observe him for improvement in the ICU.

IMAGING:
[**9-27**] CXR:
The lungs are clear. Trace left pleural effusion is noted. There
is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. There is tortuosity of
the thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic calcification. The
mediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. Hilar contours
and pulmonary vasculature are normal. Nasogastric tube follows a
normal course projecting over the left upper abdomen but the
distal end is not visualized.

[**9-27**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Multiple dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel with
fecalization.
Limited evaluation, but no definite evidence of pneumatosis. No
definite
transition point, although the bowel tapers in the right mid
abdomen.
Findings suggest small-bowel obstruction. No confirmatory signs
of bowel
ischemia (wall thickening/pneumatosis) identified within
confines of
noncontrast enhanced CT.
2. Patchy opacity at the right lung base could represent
aspiration or
infection.
3. Compression deformity of the L4 vertebral body, likely
chronic.
4. Atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries and
abdominal aorta.

[**9-29**] KUB:
1. Nonspecific mild bowel dilation are improved compared to
prior. However, persistent small-bowel obstruction cannot be
definitively excluded.
2. Enteric tube with tip overlying the stomach.

[**10-5**] CT torso:
1. Interval worsening of bibasilar opacities with development of
small
bilateral pleural effusions. This is suggestive of worsening
pneumonia,
possibly related to underlying aspiration. Some scattered
pulmonary nodules are noted, which should be followed up in [**6-5**]
months given size and underlying moderate centrilobular
emphysema.
2. Resolved small-bowel obstruction with normal appearance to
the bowel.
3. Atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta with dense
calcification of
the coronary arteries.
4. Bilateral gynecomastia of unclear etiology.

[**10-9**] CXR:
Rotated positioning. An NG type tube is in place, tip extending
beneath the diaphragm. There is a small left effusion with left
lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to [**2145-10-8**].
The effusion may be slightly larger. Again seen is atelectasis
in the right cardiophrenic region. No CHF or right-sided
effusion is identified. Ununited right clavicular fracture again
noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71yo man with advanced Parkinson's Disease, HTN
and COPD who presented with small bowel obstruction and sepsis,
then developed a pneumonia from which he did not recover.
.
# Abdominal pain: CT scan on admission indicated ischemic bowel
initially, but hten was confirmed to be a small bowel
obstruction.  It was decided to be managed medically.  It
resolved after suction NGT decompression and being held NPO for
24 hours.  He put out a large quantity of liquid stool which was
guaiac negative and c diff toxin was negative.  He tolerated
tube feeds during the hospitalization and SBO eventually
resolved.  Pt's tube feeds were eventually discontinued after a
discussion with family regarding pt's goals of care.
.
# Sepsis: Pt had an elevated lactate which trended down quickly
with IVF and antibiotics.  He was started on
vanc/cefepime/metronidazole for a presumed abdominal infection
and microperforation.  He received 12L fluid over the first 24
hours of hospitalization.  He was hypotensive and managed with
pressors peripherally for his first 12 hours on the floor, at
which point he was weaned and he continued to improve.  His
lactate and WBC trended down eventually.  Antibiotics were
narrowed to vanc/unasyn for presumed intraabdominal infection.
On HD#10 however he became newly septic; a CT scan suggested
aspiration pneumonia and showed no abdominal processes.  He was
then empirically treated with vanc/cipro/zosyn for a hospital
acquired pneumonia.  His lactate increased to 5.2 and he had a
9% bandemia.  His blood pressure was tenuous over 48 ho
