IMAGING
.
MRI from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital, [**2173-9-29**]:
LUMBAR SPINE: L1-L2: There is a focal left paracentral disc
protrusion and a broad based right paracentral to extraforaminal
disc protrusion, with associated spondylitic ridging. Facet
arthritis is asymmetrically moderate on the right and mild on
the left. There is resultant severe spinal canal stenosis with
complete effacement of SCF in the thecal sac, and severe
foraminal encroachment which is worse on the right.L2-L3: The
disc is severely degenerated with bulging of spondylitic ridging
and there is moderate facet arthritis, with resultant moderate
to severe canal stenosis, severe encroachment of the left neural
foramen and moderate right foraminal encroachment.L3-L4, and
L4-L5: There is a shallow broad based dorsal disc protrusion and
moderate facet arthrisit causing moderate to canal stenosis
which is asymmetrically most prominent along the left lateral
recess, moderate foraminal encroachment on the right, and severe
froaminal encroachment of the left.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year-old woman with a past medical history
including obesity, DMII, hyperlipidemia, and cervical
spondylosis who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**2173-10-7**] with with
lower extremity weakness and was found to have stenosis at L1-2
for which she underwent laminectomy; she subsequently developed
progressive weakness in the lower extremities, upper
extremities, and face and was discovered to have evidence of
AIDP.  She was initially admitted to the Neurosurgery Service
and subsequently transferred to the Neurology Service.
.
# NEURO:
When the patient first presented, she was evaluated by both
Neurosurgery and Neurology, where she was found to have diffuse
weakness, R>L, a R sided facial palsy, decreased pinprick to the
mid thighs, saddle anesthesia, brisk reflexes in the upper
extremities, but no reflexes in her lower extremities.  It was
suspected that her inability to walk was due to her lumbar
stenosis, and that her facial and upper extremity weakness were
due to a lacunar stroke, that was too small to pick up on MRI.
She was initially scheduled to go to the ER on [**10-8**] for
laminectomy, however this was delayed for further work-up.  She
had a repeat MRI with DWI to rule out possible infarction to
explain her symptoms, which was negative for infarct.  On [**10-12**]
she went to the OR for L1-L2 laminectomy.  During surgery on
[**10-12**], a CSF sample was obtained, which showed an elevated
protein of 197, with 1 WBC and 24 RBCs.  On [**10-13**], patient
complained of increased pain and was observed to have
progressive increase in weakness in her upper extremities as
well as a bilateral facial droop, R>L. She also increased her
requirement for O2 due to dyspnea.  She was re-evaluted by
Neurology, who found her facial weakness to be worse, with
complaints of dysarthria, dysphagia, and mild dyspnea.  Concern
was raised for either GBS vs. CIDP vs. new stroke affecting her
left side.  As her respiratory status continued to decline, she
was transferred to the ICU and intubated.  An EMG was consistent
with the concern for [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **].  Accordingly, a five-day
course of   IVIG was prescribed.  Thereafter the patient
experienced gradual increases in strength and a return of
reflexes, most notable in the left biceps.  After transfer to
the floor, her strength continued to improve, particularly in
her upper extremities.

# RESP:
Because of worsening respiratory status, on [**10-13**] the patient was
transferred to the ICU and intubated.  On [**10-19**], after
completing her course of IVIG, she underwent a successful SBT
and was extubated.  However, shortly after extubation she
desaturated and had to be emergently reintubated.  Ultimately, a
tracheostomy was performed. She continued to receive oxygen
supplementation via tracheostomy during the remainder of her
hospital stay.
.
# ID
In the course of the hospitalization, the patient developed a
fever.  Sputum culture demonstrated gram positive cocci in
clusters for which IV vancomycin was begun ([**2173-10-28**]) and
subsequently switched to nafcillin after it was determined to be
coagualase positive staph sensitive to nafcillin.  Nafcillin was
discontinued after one week.  Stool was positive for c.
difficile toxin for which flagyl was started ([**2173-10-29**]). For a
concurrent urinary tract infection, ciprofloxacin was initiated
([**2173-10-28**]) and continued for a ten day course. It was determined
that flagyl should be continued for a 14 day course. The last
dose of flagyl should be given on [**2173-11-12**].
.
# GI
Tube feeds were provided to ensure adequate nutritional intake
throughout the hospitalization. Initial attempts to place a PEG
in conjunction with the trach were thwarted as the patient was
found to have "concretions" in the esophagus.  A follow-up EGD
demonstrated a clear esophagus, suggesting the concretions had
spontaneously passed.  As the patient seemed to attain improved
attention and motor function following the IVIG treatments, the
placement of a PEG was ultimately delayed with the hope she
could begin oral intake.  After transfer to the neurology floor,
speech and swallow study was attempted but tracheostomy size was
too large. On repeat study, she passed to receive NGT diet of
ground consistency and nectar prethickend liquids. So that she
could receive adequate nutritional support, she had a PEG tube
placed on [**2173-11-5**]. She is on goal tubefeeding of fi
