Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Leukocytosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71 yo Mandarin-speaking man who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**5-25**] for evaluation of a three-week history of blurred vision
and was subsequently found to have a WBC of 300,000 and was
diagnosed with AML.  He was twice leukopheresed and then was
treated with idarubicin for 3 days and a continuous infusion of
ARA-C for 7 days.  A follow-up bone marrow on [**2142-7-19**] showed
remission.

Of note, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course at that time was
complicated by the findings of interstitial pulmonary
abnormalities and pulmonary nodules on imaging studies; these
were ultimately thought to be a chronic finding, but because of
his RLL lesion, he was treated empirically for aspergillosis
with voriconazole, and he was also given a course of
levofloxacin. Further investigation following his discharge from
the hospital demonstrated that he had been treated with
gatifloxacin and azithromycin at an OSH in [**2140**] for presumed
Rhodococcus equi pneumonia (the organism was cultured from BAL
fluid at that time); the significance of this finding and the
relative adequacy of this treatment remains unclear.  A sputum
culture obtained after readmission in [**7-25**] for dyspnea and
hemoptysis showed Mycobacteria gordonae (a known contaminant and
not likely to cause disease).  A chest CT done [**2142-8-14**]
demonstrated a persistent spiculated nodule in his right lower
lobe, multiple opacities in the right and left upper lobes that
were more prominent than on previous examinations, unchanged
calcified mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and stable
low-attenuation liver lesions.

Since his diagnosis with AML he has been followed as an
outpatient the division of infectious diseases.  In summary, his
voriconazole was discontinued [**2142-10-24**] based upon the presumption
that he appears too well to have persistant infection and the
lack of any definitive evidence (e.g. culture data) of
infection. He was scheduled to be seen in pulmonary clinic for
follow-up of the persistent collapse vs. atelectasis of his
right middle lobe out of concern for another primary malignancy.


He was seen last week in oncology clinic and was noted to have a
WBC of 19,000 without any blasts.  Follow-up today in clinic
showed an asymptomatic WBC of 64,000 with 42% blasts.  After
discussion the matter with his family, the patient agreed to be
admitted for treatment of relapsed AML.  He was given 3 grams of
hydroxyurea orally and 300 mg of allopurinol orally in the
clinic and was then admitted to the BMT floor.

Past Medical History:
1. AML: Diagnosed in [**2142-6-21**], status-post remission induction
with 7+3 chemotherapy
2. Pulmonary disease as per HPI, s/p treatment for aspergillosis
3. Chronic micronodular pulmonary disease due to pneumoconiosis
(retired coal miner)
4. Bleeding peptic ulcer disease in [**9-/2141**]
5. Left knee surgery
6. Prolonged (two month) course of gatifloxacin and azithromycin
for possible Rhodococcus equi pneumonia [**2140**]
7. PPD negative [**8-25**]

Social History:
He worked at a coal mine for about 20 years in [**Country 651**]. Former
smoker, with a 100 pack-year smoking history; he quit smoking in
[**2139**]. No EtOH consumption. He currently lives with his wife,
daughter and son-in-law. [**Name (NI) **] has 5 children.

Family History:
His mother, who passed away 3 years ago, and his brother, whom
he has not seen for 7 years, both had tuberculosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo man with AML, status-post idarubicin and ARA-C in [**Month (only) **]
[**2141**], initially in  remission by bone marrow biopsy at that
time, now with relapsing AML/acute leukemic crisis (WBC 64,000
with 42% blasts) and mild acute renal failure.

1. Relapsing AML:

Patient presented with recurrence of his AML.  He was managed
with first Hydrea,
then re-induction with MEC chemotherapy.  He tolerated this
well.
He developed neutropenia and spiked temperatures.  His initial
infectious work up was unrevealing, with the exception of
bilateral basilar lung disease on chest xray.
Sputum cultures only revealed sparse oropharyngeal flora.  He
was managed with
empiric cefepime/vancomycin.

2. Pulmonary: Elaborate and complicated history of pulmonary
disease with possible superimposed infectious disease (recent
fungal infection? remote Rhodococcus pneumonia?) as detailed in
the HPI.  Has completed course of antifungal therapy for
aspergillus, as well as antibiotic therapy for rhodococcus.  He
has a history of
coal-worker's pneumoconiosis as well.

3. Acute Renal Failure: Admission creatinine elevated to 1.3
from a baseline of 0.9.  Likely etiologies include an effect of
tumor lysis vs. pre-renal azotemia.  This returned to baseline
with hydration.

On [**11-27**] (Hospital day 20), the pt. was transferred to the
ICU for persistent tachycardia (uncontolled atrial fibrillation)
and hypotension, presumed to be related to sepsis.  Shortly
after arrival to the ICU, he was intubated and placed on a
ventilator for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Over the course of
the next three hospital days, the pt's. clinical status
deteriorated despite treatment with multiple antibiotics,
pressors and mechanical ventilation.  The pt. became profoundly
acidemic on the 23rd hospital day and progressively hypotensive
despite increasing doses of pressors.  A family meeting was held
given his deteriorating status but it was decided to continue
all current treatment, however, it was determined that CPR was
not indicated.  Shortly thereafter, the pt. went into asystole.
He was pronounced deceased at 2:02pm on [**2142-11-30**].
