Chief Complaint:
Transfer from outside hospital for NSTEMI

None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old man with a history of CAD, PVD,
and EtOH abuse who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] ICU for cardiac
evaluation.  According to a discharge summary from [**Hospital1 2177**] (on
[**2155-1-30**]), he was recently seen at [**Hospital6 6640**] where
he received a cardiac cath. That cath showed a large diffuse
restenosis of his LAD stent and well as moderate disease in his
LCx and RCA.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 2177**] where he was evaluated
and felt to be a poor surgical candidate.  Overlapping stents to
his LAD were also considered.  However, the patient refused both
options and left AMA, due to withdrawal symptoms according to
his wife. Since that time, he reported increasing SL NTG
requirements and worsening SOB. He then presented to [**Hospital3 **]
with significantly increased recurrent CP.  CP began on [**2155-2-1**],
substernal radiating to both arms.  He took 6 SL NTGs without
relief. He also noted coughing up blood for ~30 minutes.
.
In [**Hospital3 **] ED, he reportedly had ST depressions in V3-6 and
ruled in for NSTEMI.  Peak cardiac enzymes available in OSH
records showed TropI 29.74, CK 422, MB 71.1.  Per report from
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital, he has been CP free since the [**Hospital3 **] ER
with morphine and nitro gtt. He had been on asa/plavix but
received no heparin due to thrombocytopenia.  Heme/Onc was
consulted and agreed with holding heparin given high bleeding
risk. He had hemoptysis/UGIB there and received he may have
received blood transfusion today. He is a heavy drinker and his
last drink was on [**2-1**].  At [**Hospital3 **] he was tremulous and
hallucinating and was started on an ativan gtt.  Patient
requested an increase in his gtt from 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr.
.
On arrival to CCU, he appeared comfortable. However, he noted
that he had continuous chest pain since leaving [**Hospital1 2177**].  He denied
any relief of his CP at the OSH.  He noted that his CP is
currently [**5-3**] radiating to both arms. He also noted SOB and
nausea. On reevaluation soon after, without further medication,
patient denies CP. He describes "throwing up blood" on the
morning of admission.  He thinks this was the first time it
happened. He also noted coughing up some blood prior to
presenting to the OSH. He complained of chronic bilateral leg
and back pain. He also reported a 30 lb weight loss in the last
3 weeks. Further history and review of systems was difficult to
obtain due to his altered mental status on arrival.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on TTE [**2155-2-2**] from OSH
demonstrated:
Nl LV size. EF 55-60%. Apical septal wall is hypokinetic. LA and
RA nl in size. RV size and function nl. Moderate subvalvular

[**2155-2-2**] TTE (at [**Hospital1 18**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

[**2155-2-3**] Head CT:
Vascular calcifications.  Mild prominence of the sulci for age.
The brain otherwise appears normal.
