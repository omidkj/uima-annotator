Chief Complaint:
s/p right femur and left calcaneal fracture, intubated due to
tachypnea in the ED

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open Rotation Internal Fixation of right femur


History of Present Illness:
45 year-old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 87 on [**5-12**]), COPD on 4L home
O2, wheelchair bound [**12-28**] peripheral neuropathy, who presented to
the ED after falling out of his wheelchair. Per report, he was
in his usual state of health until the day of admission, when he
was using his wheelchair on the street. He misjudged a curb, and
fell out of the wheelchair. The wheelchair landed on top of him.
He came to the ED due to pain in his knees bilaterally following
this fall. On arrival to ED he was noted to have a HR 108, BP
151/76 RR 28, O2 Sat 91% RA -->96% 4L and on x-ray found to have
right sided distal femur fracture. He was evaluated by the
orthopedic surgery service and recommended OR when medically
stable. Per report and on ED vitals chart, over the course of
several hours in the ED, he continued to become increasingly
tachycardic, hypertensive, and tachypneic. It was initially felt
that this was secondary to pain, he was given percocet x2,
morphine 4 mg IV x 2, dilaudid 1 mg IV x 4 for pain control.
Upon returning from various imaging of his extremities, he
became increasingly agitated and tachypneic. He received 1 mg IV
ativan. He continued to be tachypneic and also delirious. RR
rose to 50 breaths/mininute and he was intubated. Also per ED
documentation, pt reported chest pain sometime during this
period. ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with no ST/T changes. 1st
set of cardiac enzymes were negative. At 5 AM, he was also noted
to have a temp to 101.5, and received ceftriaxone and
vancomycin.

Of note, he was recently hospitalized on [**3-25**] with COPD
exacerbation and pneumonia. He was treated with steroids and
levoflox. Also of note, he was hospitalized in [**12-2**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
COPD flare requiring intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 year old male with HIV/AIDS (CD4 87 on [**5-12**]), COPD on 4L home
O2, wheelchair bound [**12-28**] peripheral neuropathy, who presented
with distal right femur fracture and left calcaneal fracture,
intubated secondary to respiratory distress.

# s/p fall: The patient underwent right sided distal femoral
ORIF on [**6-2**] wihtout event.  During the case, the left calcaneal
fracture was investigated and a decision made to treat closed.
Intraoperatively, he received 2 units PRBCs, which resulted in a
hematocrit increase from 22 to 28.  Pain was initially managed
with standing oxcodone and dilaudid prn; later he was switched
back to home oxycontin 80 [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone for breakthrough
since he was able to tolerate POs.  LMWH was given for
thrombolic prophylaxis.  He was assessed by physical therapy and
given an activity status of non-weight bearing in BLE except for
transfers, which he was able to do successfully with assistance.


# COPD: The patient was successfully extubated in the MICU.
During the remainder of his admission, O2 was titrated to
achieve a saturation between 92 and 96% for several days before
being maintained at a fixed dose of 2L.  He was saturating
93-97% on 2L at the time of discharge.  He was put on a steroid
taper.  He was managed with standing spiriva and serevent, and
prn albuterol and ipratropium.

# Fever: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin were administered in the ED.
 Vancomycin was discontinued in the MICU, and ceftriaxone
switched to levofloxacin, on which he completed a 5 day course
prior to being transfered to the floor.  Cultures were negative.
 The patient remained afebrile until [**2177-6-10**], when he spiked a
fever of 101.6.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime for
broad spectrum coverage given his immunocomprimised status and
recent ventilator necessity.  An induced [**Month/Day/Year **] culture was
found to be contaminated, but was negative for pneumocystic
jirovecii. A urine culture was sent and found to have
contamination from skin flora only.  Blood cultures, as well as
cultures for fungus and MAC, were sent and were still pending at
the time of discharge.  CT scan on [**6-11**] showed increased
consolidation and left lower lung basal opacity favoring a
diagnosis of focal pneumonia.  The patient was maintained on
vancomycin and cefepime.  He received a PICC line to continue
the remainder of a 14 day course.

# HIV/AIDS: The patient was maintained on his outpatient regimen
of HAART and dapsone for PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 38229**] prophylaxis given his
inability to tolerated TMP/SMX.  Prophylaxis against MAC was
considered and deferred per recommendation of his [**Hospital1 778**]
attending.

# Chronic pain/peripheral neuropathy:  Pain was initially
managed with oxycodone and dilaudid, and later switched to
oxycodone and oxycontin po.  Chronic shoulder pain was
controlled with a lidocaine patch.  On [**2177-6-6**], gabapentin was
begun for treatment of neuropathic pain at a dose of 100mg tid,
which the patient noted did help his pain.

# FEN: Though initially on G-tube feeds only, the patient
returned to his outpatient regimen of full po diet supplemented
by nightly G-tube feeds.

# Prophylaxis was undertaken with LMWH, famotidine, dapsone, and
a bowel regimen which included senna, docusate sodium, and
bisacodyl.
