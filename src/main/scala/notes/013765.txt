Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**]
Chief Complaint:
Esophageal Cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2197-5-19**] - Minimally invasive esophagectomy and tube jejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a gentleman with the diagnosis of esophageal
carcinoma.  As you know, he was noted to have a mass at his
esophagogastric junction.  This is in the setting of some
dysphagia.  The mass did not seem to be particularly large but
was biopsied and has adenocarcinoma.  He has been staged
including an endoscopic ultrasound, which was done at my
request, which shows this to be a T3 lesion.  He had some
suspicious lymph nodes which were in the periesophageal region.
He has been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] and I have discussed his care
with him and it was thought best that he be offered
chemoradiation.  There has been
some difficulty in getting things done due to his language
difficulties.  He has had a PET scan which shows the tumor
itself but no evidence of metastatic disease.  He has not had
any significant weight loss.

He has completed his chemoradiation.  He has
had a followup scan, which still shows some activity in the area
of the tumor.  He does have two local nodes which take up FDG,
but these may be inflammatory.  There is no evidence of
metastatic disease.


Past Medical History:
1. Esophageal Cancer
Patient was initially diagnosed in [**2197-1-4**] at which time he
developed problems swallowing with solid food getting stuck in
his mid-chest. EGD on [**2197-1-4**] demonstrated a 3cm malignant,
nodular mass at the GE junction with biopsy consistent with
adenocarcinoma, extending beneath squamous epithelium.
Endoscopic ultrasound was performed on [**2197-1-16**] with staging
consistent with T3N1.  He is being treated with 5FU and
radiation.  He had his first dose of 5-FU on [**2197-2-25**] which he
tolerated well.  Given his renal insufficiency he is not a
candidate for cisplatin therapy, however his primary oncologist
is considering adding a second [**Doctor Last Name 360**] depending on how he
responds to 5-FU
2. Anemia
3. Asthma
4. Hypertension
5. Hypothyroidism
6. Gout, chronic smoldering, polyarticular
7. Chronic Renal Insufficiency - baseline cr 1.4

anemia s/p Ivermectin therapy

[**2197-5-19**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post esophagectomy with a feeding tube in the
neoesophagus, terminating above the hemidiaphragm.
2. Cardiomegaly and mediastinal enlargment superiorly indicative
of mediastinal post-surgical changes or hematoma.
3. Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
4. A right-sided PICC line and central line terminate in the SVC
at various levels.
5. New left retrocardiac atelectasis and/or aspiration and a
left mid lung infiltrate that could be a focus of atelectasis
and small left pleural effusion are new on today's examination.
Continuous followup is recommended.

[**2197-5-19**] Pathology
DIAGNOSIS:

1. Esophagus, esophagogastrectomy (A-X):

a. No residual carcinoma seen; see note.

b. Twenty-one lymph nodes, no malignancy identified (0/21).

c. Two lymph nodes with partial scarring, consistent with
treatment effect.

2. Lymph node, left gastric (Y): One lymph node, no malignancy
identified (0/1).

Note: An ulcerated area up to 3 cm is present in the distal
esophagus. The area is focally re-epithelialized with gastric
cardiac-type, and fundic-type epithelium. A few isolated glands
with atypical epithelial cells are seen with other
benign-appearing glands in muscularis mucosae, probably
representing treatment effect. No definite carcinoma is seen.

[**2197-5-22**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality. Left ventricular function is
probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen but is probably
normal. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2193-2-7**], the degree of mitral regurgitation may
have increased. The other findings appear similar.

[**2197-5-24**] UGI swallow study
IMPRESSION: Limited study, but no sign of leak or holdup of
contrast.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the OR and tolerated the procedure well.
He was transferred to the ICU intubated and remained intubated
for a few days because he could not pass his RSBI although he
was on minimal vent settings of CPAP and PS of [**4-24**] with
excellent oxygenation and ventilation.  On POD 1 he had new
onset of afib and was rate controlled on diltiazem.  Tube feeds
were started.  He was diuresed with lasix gtt and kept
intubated.  An ECHO was done - see results section. POD 3 he was
extubated and tube feeds were increased.  He was transitioned to
amiodarone gtt and lopressor through
