History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 24 yo female with [**First Name3 (LF) **] Syndrome (diabetes
mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, optic atropy, and high
frequency hearing loss), who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from
OSH for hypoxia/PNA who is being transferred from OSH for
hypoxia and pneumonia.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (3) 39003**] with hypoxia/PNA.
Pt had been in [**State 4565**] in early [**Month (only) 359**] for a wedding when
she developed hypoxia, dyspnea, cough, and bronchorrhea. At OSH
she was treated for CAP and asthma exacerbation x 2 weeks. Her
hospital course was complicated by segmental lung collapse
requiring ICU admission though never intubated. She had 5
bronchoscopies with persistantly negative culture data. This was
also done as pt was unable to clear secretions. MRI done there
showed mild brainstem atrophy and nerve conduction studies were
normal. At OSH, there was concern for aspiration; however, she
was then able to eat normally. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
on above date. Here, she did well as she had completed abx at
OSH and had normal CXR without leucocytosis
.
Pt was seen in [**Hospital 191**] clinic on [**2110-1-6**] with a few days of sore
throat, rhinorrhea, temperature of 99.1 and felt like she needed
to cough, though could not. CXR done that day was unchanged from
prior. She was diagnosed with a URI vs. bronchitis. She was
empirically prescribed a
azithromycin for possible bronchitis.
.
She was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2110-1-7**] with worsening
respiratory distress. She was found to have a fever to 102.
Chest CT was negative for pulmonary embolus. It showed
"branching airspace disease in LLL; superimposed upon branching
fibrotic scar. Stellate lateral RLL superior segmental lesion."
On [**2110-1-10**] her oxygenation worsened, necessitating 100% NRB.
Per report, initial CXR revealed LLL and RML PNA with possible
pleural effusions. CXR [**2110-1-11**] showed worsening airspace
opacities in the RML and LLL with worsening pleural effusions.
ABG was 7.45/45/76/96. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for
possible biopsy.
.
On admission, patient states that she does not feel SOB. No CP.
No orthopnea. Feels fatigued. Endorses fever on presentation to
OSH. No abdominal pain/ diarrhea. Mild nausea. No vomiting.
Feels like need to cough though "can't get it up."

Admission labs:


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia - Culture negative. She responded well to nebulizer
treatments and aggressive chest PT, especially a device called
an in-exsufflator. By HD3 she had improved oxygen saturation (on
RA) and was found to have reinflated her RLL. Clinically she was
noted to have very poor inspiratory effort and decreased cough;
likely related to her [**Month/Day/Year **] syndrome. She will receive outpt
PFTs.  She was inititally treated with Axithro and ceftriaxone
and then changed to PO treatment with Cefpodoxime.  She was
discharged with instructions to complete a 7 day course of
antibiotics (started [**1-16**] to be completed [**1-23**]) and Albuterol
and ipratropium inhalers.
- Cefpodoxime Proxetil 200 mg PO Q12H Duration: 7 Days Order

should follow up at [**Last Name (un) **] within the next week.
.
# Diabetes Insipidus - On DDAVP [**Hospital1 **] outpt. Serum sodiums were
initially labile likely secondary to fluid balance and change in
ddavp dosage.  DDAVP was restored to home dose and serum sodiums
stabilized to 130-134.
.
# Neurologic - not active during hospitalization. Followed as
outpt by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3315**].
