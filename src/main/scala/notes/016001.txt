CT Head [**7-14**]
1.  Small focus of blood in the posterior right frontal lobe
likely represents cortical and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Marked brain atrophy, with ventricular and sulcal prominence,
and numerous coarse calcifications throughout both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and
white matter, which may represent tuberous sclerosis, perinatal
cytomegalovirus infection, or sequela of other prior infectious
processes


Brief Hospital Course:
<B>A/P:</B>  77 y/o M with a PMHx of CHB s/p PPM, CAD s/p MI,
HTN, LBBB at baseline, blindness, HOH, who initially presented
to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2176-7-14**] s/p fall and had VF arrest on [**7-22**] now
intubated.

<B>1. Respiratory Failure </B>
Initially intubated on arrival to the ED given his SAH and MS
changes.  He was extubated on [**7-15**], and was re-intubated
peri-code for airway protection.  Had no known parenchymal lung
disease to prevent safe extubation.  However, appears to have
had peri-code aspiration and was initially not responsive.
Received treatment for  aspiration PNA with Vanco/Zosyn and
diuresed aggressively.  Had attempted SBT on [**7-26**] which failed
due to persistant tachypnea and low tidal volumes.  In
discussion
with family, trach would not be his wish, so on [**8-3**], pt. was
extubated with plans for CMO if he would not breath
spontaneously.  He was quickly transitioned to comfort measures
with ativan and morphine to treat shortness of breath and passed
away with family at bedside.

<B>2. s/p VF arrest</B>
Was on floor when had spontaneous VF arrest.  Appears to have
devolved from Afib with aberrancy as initial cause.  EP
following.  Interrogation of PPM otherwise unrevealing.
.
<B>3. SAH s/p fall </B>
On coumadin with hx of falls; admitted initially with
SAH/subcortical hemorrhage.  Admitted to trauma service;
followed by neurosurgery/neurology.  It was decided not to
proceed with operative management and to watch his interval
progression.  He was given a dilantin load and completed a 10
day course of dilantin for sz ppx.  Prior to admission he was
communicative and functional, but post-SAH was not communicative
per his nephew.  Was not able to recognize people or hold
conversation although was able to utter words but steadily
improved in the few days after his VF arrest.
.
<B>4. Fever</B>
Developed fever post-VF arrest; likely aspiration pneumonia
given his code and unresponsiveness.  Also had enterococcal UTI
.
<B>5.R pleural effusion now resolved  </B>
Had exudative effusion previously s/p chest tube drainage
(placed for PTX but had 2L of exudative drainage).  Cytology
negative.  No further reaccumulation occured during his
hospitalization.
.
<B>6. Anemia </B>
Likely AOCD, but no iron studies.
- will add on iron studies
.
<B>6. Atrial Fibrillation</B>
Off anticoagulation given multiple falls and SAH.  Is not
candidate for future anticoagulation
- will start ASA once cleared by neurosurgery in the future
.
<B>6. LUE DVT</B>
Diagnosed on [**7-25**], unable to treat given recent SAH.  No further
treatment at this time.
.
<B>7. PTX</B>
Had iatrogenic right PTX after R subclavian line placement.  A
chest tube was placed on [**7-15**] which removed 2L of serosanguinous
drainage.  CT placed to water seal on [**7-16**] and subsequently
removed prior to his transfer on the floor.
