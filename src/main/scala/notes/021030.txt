Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
53 yo Caucasan male with Type 1 DM, HTN, and HLD with no
previous cardiac surgery/procedure presents after about 2 days
of dyspnea on exertion and 1 episode of substernal chest
pressure one day prior to admission.  Patient reported that he
has been feeling feverish but only had 1x elevated temperature
of 101.7 over the weekend which was resolved with Tylenol.  He
was concerned for viral upper respiratory infection more than
his right foot infection which has been chronic for the last 5
years.  His foot was recently evaluated by podiatry who thought
his foot was doing better.  Patient also noticed increased
cough.  The sputum is clear without blood.  He denied any
pleuritic chest pain, but does have chronic swelling of his
right lower leg due to the infection.  Yesterday, he noted a
[**6-7**] non-radiating pressure in the middle of his chest while he
carried a bag.  It soon resolved after he unloaded the bag.
However, he's never had this experience before.  Of note, he
reported decreased activity tolerance from being able to walk
~300 yards to ~[**Age over 90 **] yards before getting out of breath over the
last few days. Cardiac workup revealed multivessel coronary
artery disease and cardiac surgery was consulted for
revascularizatin.

[**2153-6-21**] FOOT X-RAY:
Soft tissue indentation is seen at the plantar aspect of the
foot, compatible with a soft tissue defect or ulcer. There are
postoperative changes at the hindfoot with evidence of prior
destruction or debridement at the region of the anterior
subtalar joint with an ovoid methyl methacrylate presumably
antibiotic impregnated spacer in this region. A similar spacer
is also visualized in the region of the fifth tarsometatarsal
joint. Extensive chronic arthropathy is seen involving the
intertarsal and tarsometatarsal joints in addition to the first
metatarsophalangeal joint. There is vascular calcification.
IMPRESSION: The overall appearance is similar to prior
examination and while osteomyelitis is not excluded, no clear
new area of bone destruction is seen.

Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the mid to distal infero and mid to distal antero septal wall,
akinesis of the mid to distal inferior wall, distal anterior and
distal lateral walls . Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %). The remaining
left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
LV function may be slightly improved with improvement of the mid
to distal inferior wall. Previous WMA's described persist.
LVEF~35%. RV systolic function remains normal. MR remains mild.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 yoM with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,
Hypertension and NSTEMI with 3Vessel disease on recent cath.  He
is also being treated for Staph aureus bacteremia from an
uncertain source that may be his chronic right foot
osteomyelitis.
.
#. CAD.  Patient was worked up for NSTEMI and r/o venous
thrombosis.  He was optimized with heparin drip,
ASA/Metoprolol/statin.  Diuretic and valsartan were held given
elevated renal function (Crt 1.8) and cardiac catheterization.
He subsequently underwent catheterization ([**2153-6-21**]) which
demonstrated 3 vessel disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted for
surgical intervention.  Meanwhile, patient was cleared from
venous thrombosis in the lower extremity. His cardiac enzymes
continue to increase, and Integrillin adjusted to renal function
was started.  His BP gradually decreased to SBP ~ 100 with
borderline tachycardia.  Later, he began to have chest pain and
SOB at rest.  After discussion with the cardiology fellow and
the CCU, pati
