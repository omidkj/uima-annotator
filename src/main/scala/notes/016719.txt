Scrotal Ultrasound [**2192-12-28**]
IMPRESSION: Normal testes. Diffuse scrotal edema. No gas seen in
the imaged
soft tissues about the scrotum. CT of the pelvis is more
sensitive for the
detection of subcutaneous gas in this patient with an extremely
large body
habitus.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2192-12-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings compatible with necrotizing fasciitis and Fournier's
gangrene
with multifocal abscesses and locules of gas with phlegmonous
changes
involving the medial compartments of both thighs, left inguinal
hernia, and
the left penis.
2. Nonspecific enlarged portacaval lymph node. Clinical
correlation with any underlying liver disease is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the general surgery service on
[**2192-12-28**] and had a an extensive debridement of his Fournier's
Gangrene.  His peripenile abscess was also incised and drained
and a penrose placed by urology.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient remained intubated and in
the ICU due to his extensive wounds.  He was initially delirious
thought to be secondary to sepsis on presentation.  Once
extubated, his mental status steadily improved and he became
clear and coherent.  He self extubated on [**2193-1-15**].

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient was intubated and taken to the OR for
extensive debridement on [**2192-12-28**].  He remained intubated until
[**2193-1-4**] when he self extubated.  He was placed on oxygen which
was weaned over the duration of his admission and was saturating
well on room air.  He was kept intubated due to his extensive
dressing changes during which he required a great deal of
sedation and pain control.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids and
tube feeds while intubated in order to maintain nutrition.  His
tube feeds reached an adequate goal.  Once extubated and his
mental status cleared his diet was advanced.  He was tolerating
a regular diet without nausea or vomiting.

Endocrine:  While in the ICU, the patient required an insulin
infusion in addition to standing doses and sliding scales.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for the management of his diabetes.  He was
started on an agressive humalog sliding scale (please see
orders).  His glargine was increased to 90 units nightly.  At
the time of discharge his blood sugars were ranging from
80s-100s.

ID: ID was consulted on the management of his necrotizing
fasciitis/[**Last Name (un) 26581**];s Gangrene.  He was initially placed on IV
Vanco/zosyn/clinda.  As cultures resulted, the regimen was
changed to zosyn/clinda.  Cultures showed GBS and the ID
recommendation was to give PCNG 4 million units 24h for 14 days
after the last debridement.  He was last debrided during his vac
change on [**2193-1-10**] and should remain on IV antibiotics until
[**2193-1-24**].

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, pneumoboots, and was put on famotidine while NPO.  PT
worked with him, but he remained fairly immobile.  He was able
to stand with minimal assist using a rollwing walker, but had
difficulty ambulating.  He was discharged to a facility in order
to continue his rehabilitation.

At the time of discharge on HD 15, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
voiding without assitance and still requiring physical therapy
for mobility issues as well as continued IV antibiotics.
