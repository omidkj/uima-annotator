History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 F with hx of COPD, previous hx of intubations,
presented to OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) with several day history
of cough productive of yellow sputum. She denies C/P, shortness

SINGLE AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is marked
interstitial prominence noted bilaterally. No focal pulmonary
opacities are evident. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The pulmonary artery trunk is markedly prominent
indicating pulmonary hypertension which may be related to
patient's underlying COPD. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is
no evidence of volume overload. There is flattening of bilateral
hemidiaphragms with overexpansion of lungs consistent with known
COPD.
Both humeri appear hypoplastic. This may represent a congenital
deformity or old fracture deformities.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Marked prominence
of interstitial markings and hyperexpansion may relate to COPD.

CT Chest [**2140-5-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with emphysema with superimposed
interstitial edema. These findings in combination with
respiratory motion limit assessment for coexisting chronic
interstitial lung disease. A dedicated outpatient HRCT when the
patient can tolerate such a study would be helpful to further
evaluate for possible interstitial
