Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 111695**] is an 84-year-old
Russian-speaking only male with a history of diabetes who is
very active and presenting with the acute onset of [**10-27**]
substernal chest pain and shortness of breath.

He denies a prior history of chest pain, shortness of breath,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or lower extremity
edema.  He walks extensively every day.  He reports onset of
his pain on the afternoon of admission while sitting at a bus
stop.  It was accompanied by shortness of breath but not
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or radiation of his pain.
After returning home, he called Emergency Medical Service who
noted the patient to have frothy sputum production.

In the Emergency Department, his electrocardiogram showed
incomplete right bundle-branch block, left anterior vesicular
block, and 2-mm ST elevations in I aVL and V2 through V3.
His right bundle-branch block and ST changes were new from a
comparison study in [**2100-5-18**].

He was given aspirin, heparin, sublingual nitroglycerin,
nitroglycerin drip, and Lasix and was taken emergently to the
catheterization laboratory where he was found to have a 90%
middle left anterior descending artery lesion and 40% right
coronary artery lesion.  He underwent stenting of his middle
left anterior descending artery and was started on
Integrilin.  A right heart catheterization was also performed
which showed a right atrial pressure of 5, pulmonary artery
pressure of 15, cardiac output of 2.85, and a cardiac index
of 1.8.  He was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes; diet controlled.  Last hemoglobin A1c
of 6.3 in [**2101-1-18**].
2.  Osteoarthritis.
3.  Status post hernia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atarax 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife, very active.  No
smoking or alcohol.  A retired store manager.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Blood pressure
of 100/60, heart rate of 80, respiratory rate of 23, oxygen
saturation of 97% on 2 liters.  In general, an elderly
Russian-speaking male in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Mucous membranes were moist.  Neck revealed no jugular venous
distention.  Cardiovascular revealed a respiratory rate.
First heart sound and second heart sound.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Lungs revealed diffuse bilateral coarse breath
sounds.  The abdomen soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  Normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema.  Distal pulses were 1+.
Catheterization site without swelling, ecchymosis, or bruits.
Neurologically, alert and oriented.  Strength was [**5-22**]
bilaterally.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram in the Emergency
Department as above.  Left axis deviation, left anterior
vesicular block, new incomplete right bundle-branch block,
and ST elevations in I, aVL, V2 and V3.

Post catheterization electrocardiogram revealed left axis
deviation, left anterior vesicular block; right bundle-branch
block now resolved.  Q waves in V2 and V3.  ST changes
resolving in I and aVL.

A chest x-ray revealed borderline cardiomegaly, bilateral
hilar congestion, diffuse valvular interstitial infiltrates,
right greater than left; consistent with moderate congestive
heart failure.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 84-year-old previously male with a
history of diabetes (diet controlled) who presented with
acute anterior myocardial infarction, status post cardiac
catheterization and stenting of middle left anterior
descending artery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Ischemia:  The patient was treated
post catheterization with aspirin, Integrilin times 18 hours,
Plavix, and Lipitor.  A beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were
also started at low doses and titrated up as tolerated.

Over the course of his hospitalization, he continued to have
occasional episodes of chest pain without electrocardiogram
changes or increased enzymes.

(b)  Pump:  A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which
showed an ejection fraction of 35% to 40% and mild dilation
of the left ventricle.  The echocardiogram also showed septal
distal lateral and distal inferior akinesis, apical
dyskinesia, and probable anterior hypokinesis.

He was subsequently started on anticoagulation with Lovenox
and Coumadin.  On admission, he had moderate congestive heart
failure on his chest x-ray and was diuresed with Lasix with
good results.

(c)  Electrophysiology:  The patient presented with old left
anterior vesicular block and new right bundle-branch block.
His right bundle-branch block resolved status post
catheterization.  He also initially had a few episodes of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which also resolved.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's creatinine and hematocrit
stable status post cardiac catheterization.

3.  ENDOCRINE:  His diabetes was controlled with a regular
insulin sliding-scale while in house.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  In stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post anterior myocardial infarction and left
anterior descending artery stent.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35
to 40%.
3.  Apical dyskinesia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3.  Lopressor 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], and
follow up with primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and
follow up with [**Hospital6 733**] [**Hospital 197**] Clinic.
