Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
88F with hx of CAD, AF on coumadin, CML, CRI, s/p mechanical
fall from standing prior to being in the shower today.  She was
attempting to hang something on the shower rod when she fell and
hit her elbow. She denies any dizziness, CP, increased SOB (has
SOB at baseline from COPD), heart palpitations, loss of vision,
weakness, numbness, tingling anywhere, N/V/F/C.  Patient has a
"life necklace" that she pushed and then EMS came and brought
her to the ED.
.
Of note, patient reports that she has fallen 3 times (including
this one) over the last 2 months.  The fall prior to this one
was 1 month ago, as she was getting out of bed.  She reports no
CP, SOB, dizziness, weakness or any other associated sx with
this fall.  She again pushed her "life necklace", but because
she didn't hit anything, they did not take her to the ED.  In
addition, she had another fall 2 months prior that was as she
was getting her trash ready to take to the dumpster and she then
fell and landed on the floor.  Again, she didn't hurt anything,
so there was no ED visit.
.
Also of note, pt reports a 3 week hx of new urinary
incontinence.  She is not aware that she has to urinate "but
then I'm just going", so she doesn't make it to the bathroom
"because I don't know I need to go". She also notes fatigue over
the last 3 weeks.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt complained of left elbow pain without numbness or
tinlging. initial VS were 98.3, 90, 116/69, 18, 99 % on RA.  Of
note, while in the ED patient got up to go to the BR and BP
dropped transiently to 70 with recheck in 80's, not symptomatic,
responded to 250 cc bolus of NS, re-eval without new symptoms.
States BP usually 100/58, and she checks her BP daily.  BP
returned to 90's on re-evaluation.  Labs significant for WBC
10.6, Hct 34.3, Platelets 161, INR 2.6. creatinine 2.0 (from
baseline 2.2), UA and UCx was sent.
CXR showed mild intravascular engorgement with mild bibasilar
atelecatasis. Pelvis x-ray showed no definite fx but showed DJD
in both hips. Elbow x-ray showed mildly displaced comminuted
lateral epicondyle fracture with 6 mm osseous fragment within
the joint space. CT head was negative. Splint in place.  Ortho
saw pt in the ED and will follow, no surgery at this time. EKG
showed no change from prior.She was given Morphine 4mg, Zofran
2mg, Vicodin 5mg X 2 and got 1 L NS.
.
Upon transfer to the floor,  patient was BP 90/47, HR 80, 16,
95% on 2L (was previously 91-92 on RA in ED). Has 1 single PIV
18G.  She was c/o L arm pain and "feeling lousy" overall.  Other
than arm pain, no specific complaints.
.
ROS: Patient reports worsened SOB when lying flat x 2-3 years,
with very mild recent worsening over the last 2-3 weeks.  Denies
fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,
rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, above baseline
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

IMAGING:
CT HEAD W/OUT CONTRAST [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process.
.
ELBOW X-RAY [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: Mildly displaced comminuted
lateral epicondyle fracture with 6 mm osseous fragment within
the joint space.
.
PELVIC X-RAY [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No definite fracture or
dislocation. If there is continuedconcern for a hip fracture,
dedicated radiographs of the hip are recommended for further
evaluation.
.
CXR [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and
bibasilar atelectasis.
.
Echocardiogram (TTE) [**2118-4-12**]: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferolateral. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
35%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitatio
