History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 81114**] is a 21F w SLE with multisystem involvment including
nephritis, myo-pericarditis, pancytopenia, recently admitted for
1-month at OSH for treatment of above. She presented here after
focal seizures with visual auras and with secondary
generalization and found to have new cerebral arterial ischemic

strokes.
.
The patient was discharged [**12-6**] from OSH ([**Hospital 81115**] Hospital,
[**State 5887**]) after 31-day long complicated stay for lupus flare
notable for pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology
requiring pericardial window, acute on chronic [**State **] failure
(BUN/Cr 136/5.5), with [**State **] biopsy showing grade [**2-19**]
membranoproliferative and membanous nephropathy, Citrobacter
Freundii and bacteroides bacteremia, thrombocytopenia and anemia
(required 4 units pRBC and 4 units platelets during stay),
pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis and chest tube,
peritonitis with ascites, and urinary tract infection discharged
on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. She was treated with high
dose steroids and cellcept. The patient was found to develop
worsening thrombocytopenia and bradycardia while on the
cellcept, and it was discontinued 1 week ago. She returned to MA
last night in the care of her mother.
.
After arriving home at approximately 2200, she complained of
headache, floaters and seeing '[**Holiday 944**] trees'. Her eyes then
deviated to the left and neck stiffened with rhythmic extension
of arms and legs. There was lip biting and urinary incontinence.
The episode lasted a few minutes. EMS was activated and she was
taken to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for evaluation and had another
witnessed seizure en route.
.
At OSH, a third seizure occurred similar to the others that
terminated with 2mg lorazepam. FSGB at that time was 111. She
was not dilantin loaded. Head CT at OSH showed ill defined
hypodensity of left cerebellum, in addition to old infarcts in
right occipital and parietal lobes. Labs notable for WBC 3.1, Hb
10.9, Plt 76, Na 142, K 2.9, Cre 2.1, Glu 121, Ca 7.4, CK 67,
Trop 1.08, INR 1.1, negative urine toxicology screen.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurology evaluation, where vitals
were T-98.6 BP-127/96 HR-105 RR-16 O2Sat 96%. Concern for lupus
cerebritis or sinus thrombosis. The patient refused lab draws
and requested a PICC line. The neuro team recommended keppra
load 750mg, changing antibiotics to zosyn from cipro/flagyl
which may lower the seizure threshold, MRI/MRA/MRV brain, EEG,
and formal echocardiogram (bedside ED echo showed effusion but
no evidence of tamponade physiology). Potassium was repleted.
Due to medical complexity, MICU admission was requested by the
Neurology service.
.
Rheumatology was also consulted and they reccommended high dose
solumedrol 1000mg daily times three days once infectious or
vascular process has been ruled out. They also recommended
evaluation for TTP.
.
On [**2185-12-7**] echo showed LVEF 20% with akinesis of the distal [**12-20**]
of the LV, in addition to RV apical hypokinesis and a moderate
pericardial effusion. These findings were thought secondary to
lupus induced myopericarditis. Given the extent of her
myopericarditis, she was transferred to the CCU service.
.
Currently she complains of feeling tired and back pain from
lying flat all night. Review of systems is otherwise negative in
detail including no SOB, chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting,
abominal pain, photophobia, visual hallucinations or other
visual changes, numbness, weakness, rash. Reports chronic LE
edema bilaterally but no calf pain.
.
