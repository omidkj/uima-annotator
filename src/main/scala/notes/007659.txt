CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2148-5-22**] 8:41 AM
Reason: Change in size of PTX
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman S/P VATS, now with increased PTX after chest
tube removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Change in size of PTX
HISTORY: Status post right upper lobectomy with pneumothorax.
COMPARISON: [**2148-5-21**] at 7:16 p.m.
CHEST: PA and lateral views. Moderate right apical and anterior
pneumothorax is unchanged in size, but a new pleural fluid
component is now also present. New mild pulmonary edema is also
noted. Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged. Left lower lobe
pneumonia and right perihilar post-surgical changes are also
unchanged. Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7356**] at 11:15 a.m.
on [**2148-5-22**].
IMPRESSION: 1) Moderate right pneumothorax is stable in size
with a new hydrothorax component.
2) New mild pulmonary edema.
3) Unchanged left lower lobe pneumonia.

HISTORY: Status post right upper lobectomy and PICC placement.
COMPARISON: [**2148-5-20**].
CHEST: AP upright portable view. The right chest tube has been
removed. There is a moderate right pneumothorax, increased in
size compared to the previous study. There is associated partial
right lung collapse. Left lower lobe opacity is unchanged. There
is a new right PICC with tip at the junction of the superior
vena cava and the right atrium. Deformity of the right humeral
head with advanced right glenohumeral osteoarthritis is again
noted.
Increased pneumothorax was reported to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 3:05 p.m.
on [**2148-5-21**]. PICC line position was subsequently reported to an
intravenous therapy nurse.
IMPRESSION:
1) Moderate right pneumothorax, increased since the previous
study.
2) Satisfactory PICC position.
3) Unchanged left lower lobe opacity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted SDA [**2148-5-10**] for above procedure, tolerated
fairly well, tranferred to PACU in stable condition, extubated,
CT to suction.
PACU course significant for overnight monitoring for:low O2
Sats; close hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive pulmonary toilet,
pain control w/ toradol, MSO4> transitioned to MSO4 PCA,
atrovent/alb nebs, electrolyte monitoring and repleatment.
Hospital Course:
REspiratory- Tenuous resp status post-op requiring: high O2
supplementation (no intubation) bronchoscopy [**5-12**](clearance of
obstructed r sided plugs- removed), 6/12,[**5-14**]( thick
secretions-removed),[**5-15**](lung expanded- minimal secretions),
