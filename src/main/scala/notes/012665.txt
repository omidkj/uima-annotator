EKG: [**2147-11-29**] 19:11: sinus rhythm @78, nl axis, nl intervals,

.
[**2147-11-29**] Cardiac catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
a totally occluded proximal RCA. The LMCA was angiographically
normal.
The LAD had mild disease. The LCx was a nondominant vessel
without
critical lesions.
2. Hemodynamics after PCI revealed elevated systemic pressures,
mildly
elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15, PCWP
mean 20
mm Hg).
3. After passage of the wire across the lesion, the patient had
several
runs of NSVT, which developed into VF requiring defibrillation.
The
patient converted into an idioventricular rhythm after
defribrillation
with 200 J. He was also treated with 300 mg IV amiodarone. Later
in the
case, he spontaneously went into sinus rhythm.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with four 3.5 mm
Cypher
drug-eluting stents which were post-dilated to 4.0 mm and a 3.0
mm Zeta
stent. Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no
dissection and
normal flow (see PTCA comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the RCA.
.
[**2147-11-30**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is low normal (LVEF 50%) due to hypokinesis of the basal and
midventricular
segments of the inferior free wall and posterior wall. The right
ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline
normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending
aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt was taken straight to the cath lab. Hemodynamics were
as follows: RA 16, RV 33/17, PCW 20, PA 33/20 (27), CO/CI
6.34/2.65. Coronary angiography showed total occlusion of the
proximal RCA. Left main, LAD, and LCx were without significant
disease. Balloon inflation occurred at 9:20pm followed by
placement of 3 cypher stents and one zeta (bare metal) stent
with resulting normal flow. Pt remained hemodynamically stable.
Pt was found to have an inferior MI with RV infarction. Pt was
continued on aspirin, plavix. Aggrastat was continued to 18
hours post-cath. Pt was re-started on statin. Beta-blocker and
ACEI were titrated up. Nitro was not given. Peak CK was 2400
with peak Tn of 6.62. Cardiac enzymes trended down.
Echocardiogram found low normal (LVEF 50%) due to hypokinesis of
the basal and midventricular segments of the inferior free wall
and posterior wall and borderline normal RV systolic function.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
throughout the hospitalization. Pt was discharged with aspirin,
plavix, statin, atenolol, and lisinopril.
.
2. Pump: Echocardiogram found low normal (LVEF 50%) due to
hypokinesis of the basal and midventricular segments of the
inferior free wall and posterior wall and borderline normal RV
systolic function. Hypertension was managed with metoprolol and
captopril with BP ranging from 120-150 systolic.
.
3. Rhythm: Pt had a VT/VF arrest in cath lab in setting of wire
being passed through the artery. He was shocked with 200J and
returned to a perfusing rhythm, AVIR then NSR. He was given a
300mg IV bolus of amio. Antiarrythmics were not continued, since
the source of the arrythmia was the wire. On the floor, pt had
frequent episodes of NSVT. Electrolytes were repleted as needed.
.
4. Hypercholesterolemia: Pt was continued on Lipitor.
.
5. ETOH use: Given history of drinking 18 beers per week, pt was
put on CIWA scale with ativan q2h prn. Pt was also put on a
small standing dose of Ativan for mild aggitation. Pt did not
display any significant signs of alcohol withdrawal.
.
6. FEN: Pt was given cardiac/low sodium diet
.
