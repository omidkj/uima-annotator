History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 56 yo man with PMH of Non small cell lung
CA,dementia, brain injury, DM, DVT who was brought in by EMS
after family noted decline in his cognition and strength over
the last week.  His wife reports that his Lung Cancer was
diagnosed in [**2143-7-3**], and that he had a right lung lobectomy,
chemo,radiation all in [**2143-7-3**].  Outside notes however report
that Lung Bx was in [**2143-1-3**] and portacath for chemo was removed
in [**2143-4-3**].  Wife says that he had 1 week of chemo, and then
had to be discontinued because portacath infection.  Lung
surgery was complicated by vocal cord paralysis. He has
continued to lose weight, becoming weaker.  Apparently over the
last week had more difficulty with cognition and generally
became weaker.  They note that left arm seems weaker than right.
 He can still speak, but speaks less reliably and seems confused
from time to time.Fluctuates.  He has been unable to walk for
the last several days.  EMS found him on floor with pressure
ulcers over left ear and left side.

On Discharge:

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2-28**]
Right frontal lobe mass as described above. Differential
diagnosis includes necrotic metastasis, primary cystic neoplasm,
or abscess. MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

MRI Head with and without [**2-29**]
Large right frontal lobe mass with extensive surrounding
vasogenic edema which most likely represents a metastatic lesion
in this patient with lung cancer.  Differential include primary
glial neoplasm.

CT Head [**3-1**]
Interval right frontal craniotomy and resection of the right
frontal lobe mass with hyperdense material in the resection bed
concerning for acute hemorrhage. Significant interval decrease
in leftward shift of the normally midline structures compared to
[**2144-2-28**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH with complaints of recent
weight loss, left sided weakness, cognition difficulties,
inability to ambulate , and difficulty speaking.  CT Scan in the
ED showed a new large right frontal mass.  He was admitted to
the neurosurgery service and on the morning of [**2-29**] it was
decided that he would undergo resection of the mass with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 548**] on the morning of [**3-1**].  Given his history of nonsmall
cell lung cnacer a CT Chest was obtained to evaluate for any
lesions.  The CT was negative for lesions but an AV fistula was
found between the Right subclavian artery and vein. No emergent
treatment was needed for this and per radiology this should be
followed up with a potential IR guided procdure in the near
future.  Also on the 27th an MRI with gadolinium showed a cystic
enhancing, 4.3cm by 5.5cm mass in the right frontal area with
1cm of midline shift. In preparation for the OR a WAND study was
obtained early in the morning of [**3-1**].  In order to do this
study, in the setting of a low GFR, consent was required to
administer the gadalinium which was obtained by one of the
neuroradiology residents.

On [**3-1**] he underwent a right frontal craniotomy for mass
resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**].  Post-operativly he was transferred to
the surgical ICU intubated for further care.
He remained stable overnight and on [**2144-3-2**] he was extubated in
the morning without difficulty and transferred to the floor
later that day. His steroids were tapered as his exam continued
to improve. He was evaluated by vascular surgery for his h/o
coumadin use for arm DVT and findings on CT but their
recommendation was that anticoagulation was not needed and
patient should follow up with vascular surgeon in 3 months. He
was evaluated by PT and OT and felt suitable for rehab.  He was
also evaluated by Speech and swallow and failed twice on
consecutive days and ended up having a PEG placed [**2144-3-4**].  24
hours later it was ready for use for meds and tube feed was
started and goal was reached. His glucose was elevated due to
steroids but this improved with tapering of steroids and
addition of tube feed and usual insulin doses.  He was seen by
neuro-oncology and radiation oncology and has plans for follow
up [**2144-3-30**] at which point some type of radiation therapy will be
initiated 3- 6 weeks after surgery. He had staples in his wound
which was well healing and should be removed [**2144-3-11**].  His left
motor function continued to improve and was essentially full at
time of discharge with the exception of [**4-6**] left IP.
