CT: 1. Pelvic fractures: comminuted fx of left sacrum extending
into the first sacral arch. A second nondisplaced fx in the
inferior right sacral ala. Proximal left superior pubic ramus fx
and a comminuted fx of the left ischiopubic ramus. 2. Possible
thrombus in two pulmonary vessels of the right lower lobe. It is
unclear if these vessels are arteries or veins. 3. Small
bilateral pulmonary effusions with adjacent consolidations. 4. 1
cm bladder polyp.

CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study earlier in this date,
there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Again, there is
hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarse interstitial markings
that could
reflect chronic pulmonary disease, elevated pulmonary venous
pressure, or
both. Bilateral pleural effusions or scarring with probable
bibasilar
atelectasis. Again, the possibility of supervening pneumonia
cannot be
definitely excluded.



Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. She required ICU
admission for tenuous respiratory status given her history of
COPD. She required IV Lasix for diuresis which improved overall
respiratory function. Her home medications, including her home
oxygen, for her COPD were continued.

Orthopedics was consulted for her pelvic fractures. These
injuries did not require operative intervention; her weight
bearing status was as tolerated by patient without restriction.
Her pain regimen includes standing Tylenol, Ultram and prn
Oxycodone. She is also on a bowel regimen.

She is currently continuing treatment of her UTI with Meropenem;
stop date is [**2172-5-18**].

She was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after her acute hospital stay.
