MICRO DATA:
Urine Cx [**9-27**] - 1000 GPC
Urine Cx [**9-28**] - no growth
Urinary legionella antigen negative
Blood Cx [**9-27**] - no growth

STUDIES:
CXR [**9-27**]: 1. Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.
2. New left basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia or
aspiration.
.
NCHCT [**9-27**]: No acute intracranial pathology. MRI more sensitive
for ischemia.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**9-27**]: 1. Slightly limited examination due to
patient positioning and lack of oral contrast. No
intra-abdominal source for infection identified.
2. Patchy right middle and lower lobe opacities, some which are
clearly compression atelectasis and others of which are
suspicious for regions of pneumonia or aspiration. Small right
effusion.
3. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic vascular disease.
4. Slight interval decrease in possible exophytic right-sided
fibroid. Please note it is atypical for the fibroid to not have
involuted more in a patient of this age. If alteration in care
will occur, can consider further evaluation with a dedicated
pelvic ultrasound and/or MRI as no dedicated pelvic imaging of
this lesion is noted at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
CXR [**9-29**]: Left lower lobe consolidation is persistent and
unchanged. Band-like atelectasis in the right base is new. There
is no pneumothorax. If any, bilateral small pleural effusions
are unchanged, greater on the left side. Cardiomegaly is stable.

.
NCHCT [**9-29**]: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Unchanged marked enlargement of the ventricles since [**2171-8-29**],
out of
proportion to the enlargement of the sulci, which may be related
to central atrophy or normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Clinical
correlation is advised.
.
MRI head [**9-29**]: Irregularity of left greater than right MCA
branch vessels. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis,
meningitis, or atheromatous change. Cerebral atrophy, with
ventricular enlargement. There is no obstruction, although
communicating hydrocephalus cannot be excluded.
.
EEG [**9-30**]: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the slow
background,
the bursts of generalized slowing, and the intermittent
projected
bicentral slowing. These abnormalities suggest a widespread
encephalopathy primarily of metabolic origin. There were no
epileptiform features seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo female with a PMH significant for ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF
with EF 20%, and DM type II admitted with fever, MS change,
hypoxia, and AVF failure.
.
1) Fever: Had temperature upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], which resolved
within 24 hours. Placed on vancomycin, zosyn for coverage for
hospital acquired PNA and left basilar opacity was seen on CXR,
althought it was unclear if this was truly a new opacity vs.
secondary to pulmonary edema. Bld cxs with no growth. Initial
urine cx with 1000 GPC but then subsequent urine cx no growth.
Urinary legionella antigen negative. Unable to obtain sputum
cultures. There was also initial concern for meningitis;
however, the family declined a LP and the pt's mental status did
improve off of meningtic doses of abxs. She was then transferred
to the medical floor where she remained afebrile.
.
2) AMS: MS change improved within 24 hrs of admission and AAO X
2 upon transfer to floor. Initial w/u with NCHCT negative, less
likely meningitis/encephalitis given MS improvement on
non-meningtis abx coverage as above. However, within 2 hrs of
initial medical floor evaluation, pt became obtunded to sternal
rub. FS 180s, EKG without ischemic changes, attempted ABG X 3
without success in L wrist. VSS, AF throughout. Stat NCHCT
without acute change. Did notice new neck stiffness on exam, and
t here was a question of encephalitis/meningitis but it was felt
to be unusual to develop meningitis in hospital. Pt's MS
eventually improved within 4 hours. Neurology was consulted for
question of non-convulsive status epilepticus and EEG obtained
that showed no epileptiform waveforms but did reveal diffuse
slowing suggestive of encephalopathy from metabolic causes.
Another LP was offered to the family, who again declined. Pt was
started on ceftriaxone and acylovir in addition to pre-existing
vancomycin for meningitic/HSV encephalitis coverage. A MRI head
revealed irregularity of the MCA branch vessels that can be
suggestive of small vessel disease, meningitis, or vasculitis.
The pt's mental status continued to remain poor, and after d/w
the pt's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] confirmed that pt has had prior dx of
Alzheimer's, and the family, it was decided to make the pt
comfort measures. Abxs were discontinued, procedures should be
avoided with the exception of hemodialysis.
.
3) ESRD/clotted AVF: Underwent placement of R temporary femoral
HD line for HD access in setting of clotted R AVF upon
admission. The patient underwent AVF thrombectomy by transplant
surgery on [**10-2**]; however, revision failed and the pt required
placement of a tunneled L IJ HD catheter by IR on [**10-3**]. The
family is in agreement to continue HD for now in spite of being
comfort measures; however, did agree to not place any further
lines for HD access should her LIJ tunneled catheter fail. The
