Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. EGD [**2179-2-5**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19122**] is a 78F with PMH of cardiomyopathy (EF 45% per OSH
records), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, questionable liver
cirrhosis, recent ERCP [**2179-1-29**] with sphincterotomy given CBD,
discharged on [**2179-1-31**]. She said that after she was discharged to
home, she continued to feel poorly, weak, just not herself. She
wasn't eating much. Then, beginning yesterday, she felt very
short of breath in the morning. Her caretaker took her to her
[**Hospital 197**] clinic appt, where she was SOB and pale. From there she
was taken to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where she was given lasix 40mg IV
x1, with 900cc urine output, with improvement in respiratory
status. She was tachycardic initially (not documented if sinus
or Afib with RVR), and given lopressor 5mg IV x1, with
improvement in rate to sinus 60s. She was then admitted for
further management with concern for acute on chronic systolic
heart failure exacerbation. where she was found to have Hct drop
from 28 to 21. She says that she had only taken one dose of the
Coumadin, and was taking Lovenox daily as a bridge. Then, at
[**Hospital3 **], she had [**2-19**] dark black stools. She denies any
chest pain, pressure, lightheadedness with this. Per [**Hospital1 **], these were guaiac positive and thought to be
melanotic.
.
After discharge on [**1-31**], she said her PCP had also discontinued
her Lasix. Therefore, in the last week, all of her
anti-hypertensives had been discontinued for low blood pressure.
She denies any recent NSAID use. She says that she had bright
blood in her underwear back in [**Month (only) 1096**]. At that time she
reports being evaluated at [**Hospital3 **]. She never had a
c-scope at that time.
.
She presented during the last admission from [**1-29**] to [**1-31**] for
elective ERCP based on obstructive picture with elevated Tbili
and mild transaminitis during admission at [**Hospital3 **] with
CT scan showing CBD at that time. She had an ERCP on [**1-29**] with
sphincterotomy.
.
On arrival to the ICU, VS T 96.5 HR 63 BP 102/49 RR 18 O2 sat
99%RA. She says that she feels tired from the long day. She
denies any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. She denies any
SOB, chest pain, chest pressure or lightheadedness.

TEE REPORT:  The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 30 cm from the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
valve abscess is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetation, or pacemaker associated mass
or vegetation visualized. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function.

Liver u/s
1. Limited evaluation demonstrating nodular hepatic contour with
increased
heterogeneous hepatic echogenicity, suggestive of cirrhosis.
2. Ascites.
3. Patent hepatic vasculature without evaluation of the right
posterior
portal vein due to patient body habitus and overlying gas.
Evaluation of the
hepatic arteries was also suboptimal due to patient difficulty
breath-holding.

Colonoscopy report:
Two 3mm sessile polyps of benign appearance were found in the
sigmoid colon. Single-piece polypectomies were performed using a
cold forceps in the sigmoid colon. The polyps were completely
removed.
Impression: Polyps in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

EGD report:
The ampulla was s/p previous sphincterotomy. There was oozing of
blood at 3 o'clock. The apexes and 3 o'clock were injected with
3 ml of epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] with good hemostasis. Cauterization
with a gold probe was applied at 3 o'clock successfully.
Impression: The exam of the esophagus was normal.
There was minimal erythema at the distal antrum.
The ampulla was s/p previous sphincterotomy. There was oozing of
blood at 3 o'clock. The apexes and 3 o'clock were injected with
3 ml of epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] with good hemostasis. Cauterization
with a gold probe was applied at 3 o'clock successfully.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.


Capsule study pending

If clinical concern persists, repeat examination could be
attempted.
