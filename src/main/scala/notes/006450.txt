Pertinent Results:
MRA CHEST W&W/O CONTRAST; -59 DISTINCT PROCEDURAL SERVIC

Reason: eval for dissection
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with epigastric pain, hypertension
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for dissection
INDICATION: Epigastric pain, which radiates to the back.
Evaluate for aortic dissection.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained
through the chest and abdomen. Axial 2D time-of-flight images
were obtained through the region of the arch vessels. Multiple
cine sequences were performed. VIBE images were performed pre-
and post-administration of contrast, and subtraction images were
obtained. Multiplanar reformations were created and analyzed on
a workstation.

COMPARISON: CT studies from [**2099-1-21**], [**2101-1-6**], [**2101-3-30**], and two hours earlier.

FINDINGS: The ascending aorta and visualized portions of the
arch vessels appear normal, and there is no evidence for
dissection. On the cine images through the aortic valve, a
dephasing jet is seen, which is compatible with aortic stenosis.
The left ventricle is also noted to be prominent.

The descending aorta is tortuous, and a large aneurysm of the
distal thoracic and abdominal aorta is again seen. Overall, the
size of the aorta has not significantly changed from prior CT
examinations dating back to [**2098**]. However, an intimal flap is
identified which originates just above the aortic hiatus and
extends to the level of the left renal artery. The celiac
artery, superior mesenteric artery, and right renal artery arise
from the true lumen. The left renal artery arises from the false
lumen, and the dissection terminates at this level. The left
kidney appears to be perfused. The right kidney was not imaged
on the post-contrast sequences, as the study was targeted to the
aorta. Multiple cysts are seen within the left kidney.

There is diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, as seen
on the prior CT studies. Multiple areas of ulceration are
present. On the pre-contrast images, there are a few focal areas
of increased signal intensity within the descending aorta, which
may represent areas of hemorrhage within the wall.

The multiplanar reformations were critical in delineating the
above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. Dissection involving the descending aorta, which extends from
just above the aortic hiatus to the level of the left renal
artery. The left renal artery arises from the false lumen while
the celiac artery, SMA, and right renal artery arise from the
true lumen.
2. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with multiple areas of
ulceration within the descending aorta, as seen on prior CT
examinations.
3. Findings consistent with aortic stenosis.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-10-30**] 7:25 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

Reason: SEVERE ABD PAIN
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with severe ab pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for aaa rupture
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: renal failure

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with severe abdominal pain.
Patient has a history of a primary peritoneal neoplasm.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to [**2101-3-30**].

TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without IV or oral
contrast.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are atelectatic
changes versus scarring in the lung bases. The thoracic and
upper abdominal aorta are again noted to be aneurysmal. There
are also mural calcifications. In the largest diameter, the
suprarenal aorta measures 4.0 cm and is unchanged when compared
to the prior study. The patient is status post infrarenal AAA
repair. There is a stable left iliac aneurysm which appears to
be bypassed. The appearance of the aorta is unchanged when
compared to the prior studies. There is a small calcified
granuloma in the right lobe of the liver. The liver otherwise
has unremarkable CT appearance with the limitations of this
non-contrast study. There are gallstones within the gallbladder.
The spleen is unremarkable with the limitation of the
non-contrast scan and the pancreas is also within normal limits.
The appearance of the kidneys and adrenal glands is also
unchanged. Both adrenal glands appear to be prominent but stable
when compared to the prior study.

There is a soft tissue density nodule within the abdominal wall
just lateral to the umbilicus (image 2, 38) which appears to be
enlarged when compared to the prior study. It now measures 2.0 x
1.4 cm (the soft tissue component previously measured 10 x 8
mm).

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is again noted a
left inguinal lymph node which is enlarged when compared to the
prior study. It now measures 2.1 x 1.7 cm (previously 1.6 x 1.5
cm). There are also several external iliac lymph nodes, the
largest one measuring 1.4 x 1.4 cm (image 2, 64). There are also
cystic-appearing areas in the region of the left ovary, the
largest one measuring 3.0 x 2.9 cm in the largest axial
diameter. The smaller one located slightly more anteriorly
measures 2.1 x 2.0 cm in largest axial diameter. They are both
not well characterized in this study. There is no free fluid or
free air in the pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: There are again noted severe degenerative changes
of the spine. There is a compression fracture of L4 which is
mild. There are also severe degenerative changes of L4/L5 with
grade [**11-28**] anterolisthesis of L4 over L5. There is likely also a
mild compression fracture of L5. These compression fractures are
of unknown acuity.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite reason for acute abdominal pain identified in
this study.

2. Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm as described above is stable
when compared to prior study.

3. Interval enlargement of subcutaneous nodule lateral to the
umbilicus which could represent a lymph node and also left
inguinal and external iliac nodes which appear to be larger,
suggesting progression of known tumor.

4. Cystic structures in the region of the left adnexa are
abnormal in a postmenopausal woman.

5. Severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine as described
above.
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: Limited assessment of renal blood flow was
performed. There is arterial flow to the right and left kidneys.
Color flow is demonstrated within the kidneys bilaterally, which
appears symmetric.

ECHO
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses is mildly increased. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow t
