Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy and GJ feeding tube placements
Total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy ([**2103-5-3**])

History of Present Illness:
52 yo female with history of [**Location (un) 805**] Syndrome, atrial
fibrillation, CHF (? diastolic, last EF 70%), history of MVR s/p
valvuloplasty [**2100**], recent recurrent PNAs (last [**1-12**] w/MSSA PNA
s/p intubation), and severe COPD, who presents with shortness of
breath. Has had body aches for the last 2 days. She reports
increased SOB, but denies cough, sputum, fever, chills,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, or dysuria.
Normally, she is on oxygen at rehab on [**1-4**] LNC. Because of the
shortness of breath and fever, she was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, the patient had the following vital signs: 98.6 120
92/60 18 97% NRB. She was noted to be in a fib with RVR with
rates up to the 140s, however, she was not rate controlled for
fear of patient being periseptic. The patient was given
levofloxacin 750mg IV ONCE, ceftriaxone 1gm IV ONCE. The patient
was given 2L of NS thinking she was tachycardic from
dehydration. She was also given combivent, and morphine 2mg IV x
2 and tylenol 1gm PO ONCE for body pain and dyspnea. Last set of
vitals were: 98.1  131  106/61  22  90%5LNC.
.
In the MICU, she arrived in acute respiratory distress and
tachypneic with heart rate in the 130s in a fib with RVR, and
hypoxic to the 80s on 6LNC. She was given morphine 1mg IV x 2,
lasix 20mg IV x 1 (leading to 300cc of urine in [**1-4**] hrs), a
trial of bipap for 15 minutes with significant improvement in
her symptoms. She was also given 5mg and 10mg IV dilt for HR in
140s, followed by dilt 60mg PO QID with improvement in her rate
down to 110s.

CXR [**4-11**]: COMPARISON: [**2103-2-22**].
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
Patient is
status post median sternotomy. The lungs are hyperinflated,
consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Since the
prior study, there has been development of bibasilar, right
greater than left opacities, worrisome for pneumonia. There is
also blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles concerning
for small pleural effusions with possible pleural thickening.
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Minimal
superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion may also be present.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right base opacity and possible small left base
opacity, worrisome for pneumonia. Possible small bilateral
pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.
2. COPD.
.
CXR [**4-12**]: Comparison is made with prior study performed a day
earlier.
Cardiomegaly is stable. The lungs are hyperinflated consistent
with patient's known COPD. Pneumonic consolidations, right
greater than left are unchanged.  There are no new lung
abnormalities. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are
stable. There are no other interval changes.
.
CXR [**4-30**]:
A tracheostomy tube and left-sided PICC are in unchanged
positions.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The lungs are stable in
appearance
with background emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions and
extensive
consolidations which are greater on the right.
.
EKG [**4-23**]:
Diffuse artifact. Probable atrial fibrillation with moderately
controlled
ventricular response. Low QRS amplitude in the limb leads. RSR'
pattern in
lead V1 is probably a normal variant. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2103-4-11**] the ventricular response is more controlled.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes persist.
.
ECHO [**4-23**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
The mitral annular ring appears well seated with normal
gradient. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.



Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo female with history of [**Location (un) 805**] Syndrome, atrial
fibrillation, CHF (? diastolic, last EF 70%), history of MVR,
recent recurrent PNAs, and severe COPD, who presents with
shortness of breath, leukocytosis, bandemia, and RLL infiltrate.
.
#Lactic acidosis: Patient developed abd pain and required
pressors overnight on [**5-3**]. Her lactate rose and her cdiff toxin
returned positive.  WBC rose. She was started on pressors at
times maxed levofed and neo. Flaygl was started and surgery was
consulted and determined need for emergent OR for colectomy.
.
#. Dyspnea/hypoxia: Patient with a white count of 29 with
bandemia, and dense RLL consolidation, which raises the concern
for acute bacterial pneumonia. She has a history of MSSA but
also given her stay at a rehab facility, healthcare associated
pneumonia and hospital acquired pneumonia were also considered.
Also there was a component of acute pulmonary edema and COPD. PE
is unlikely given clear precipitant for dyspnea/hypoxia and that
patient has been therapeutic on coumadin. Patient treated with
Vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin given her recent hospitalization
within 90 days, her stay at rehab, and severity of illness as
well as MRSA positive in her Nares.  She was put on standing
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers and home dose of steroids.
Patient was diuresed with 20 IV lasix daily.  Over the first 5
days of admission the patient required 60-80% high flow to
maintain sats in the 90s.  Due to lack of clear improvement and
concern for increasing sputum, she had a bronch (awake) which
showed minimal secreations but significant airway collapse.  BAL
