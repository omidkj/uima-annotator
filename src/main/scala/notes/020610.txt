Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
Sub-sternal chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cath and stent placement to LCX and LAD
s/p tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
70y/o M w/ DM2, Hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and tobacco use.

Woken up at 4am by substernal non radiating chest pain, went to
bathroom and came back, chest pain worsened [**10-22**], severely
diaphoretic, wife noticed patient was very pale. No sob, no
LH/dizzyness, called EMS they arrived at ~6am. Transported to
[**Hospital 58045**] hospital, en route received NTG x3, asa, oxygen, pain
decreased to [**5-22**]. At GSM EKG initially showed STE in leads
II,III,AVF with STD in V1-V4. Pt repeat EKGs then showed STE in
II,III,AVF as well as V5-V6 with coupling. Patient received
heparin bolus and gtt, integrellin gtt, morphin sulfate 2mg x 3,
lopressor 5mg x 2, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI. Cath
revealed: Right Dominant; 3vd+LM; RCA-TO distal; LMCA-small with
mild dampining; LAD-80% proximal/mid; LCx-90% thrombotic
proximal lesion. HD: RA 13; RV 58/16; PAP 58/30; PCWP 31; CO
4.0; CI 2.2; SVR 1665; PASat 72% Cypher stent was placed in the
LCx. Pt had IABP placed due to high filling pressures, bridge to
possible CABG, and because of LM disease. Pt CI was around 1.6
so pt [**Name (NI) 8213**] was increased with no improvement so low dose
dopamine was started.


Past Medical History:
DM2, hypercholesterolemia, h/o DVT (2 clots in left leg) treated
medically 2 years ago, h/o ruptured disk s/p surgery [**01**]-30yrs
ago, colonic polyps (non malignant per patient), urinary
incontinence, obesity.

Social History:
h/o tobacco use, no etoh, no ivdu,

Family History:

sister 60's from MI.

Physical Exam:

Pertinent Results:

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M with DM2 who p/w STEMI with PCI's to LCx and LAD, c/b
pericardial effusion/pericarditis, ARF, liver failure, PNA, CHF,
HIT, AFib.  Brief course by system.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR
-A. Coronaries/CAD: Severe 3vd + LM by cath report with initial
PCI placed in LCx. Pt was continued on Asa, plavix, metoprolol,
Lipitor, and an [**Year (2 digits) **]. CT [**Doctor First Name **] consulted and pt received a stress
test to assess if CAD significant enough for CABG but the MIBI
showed an irreversible defect and so it was felt that a CABG
would not be beneficial. Following this, however, pt developed
SSCP again that was unable to be controlled with a nitro gtt and
multiple other medications. ECG showed slight ST depressions in
V2-V5 and pt was taken emergently back to Cath where it was seen
that the LCx was still patent. At this time 3 stents were placed
in the LAD, however after the procedure the pt was still c/o CP.
BP was slightly low after the cath and an echo showed a
pericardial effusion without tamponade - managed as below. Pt
was continually managed on ASA, plavix, Metoprolol, and
Atorvastatin. Captopril was held while pt had ARF. Several times
during admission, low dose captopril was added to the medical
regimen, however Pt suffered from short  episodes of hypotension
where on one occasion required brief pressor support.  After
discharge, Patient should be restarted on ace inhibitor once Pt
stable and volume status maximized.
*
-B. Pump/CHF: ECHO showed EF 30-40%. Pt had IABP initially
placed after cath then removed since it was determined that it
was not helping pt. Pt eventually weaned of Dopamine and
improved. He was felt to be in CHF and was diuresed gently until
the pericardial effusion was discovered - likely Dressler's
syndrome. No evidence of tamponade. Pt was given some fluids and
watched carefully. He remained hemodynamically stable and the
effusion was followed with serial echo's and was seen to be
resolving. At no point did the pt have hemodynamic compromise or
pulsus.
Pt's O2 sats were low, however, and he was felt to be wet based
on lung exam and peripheral edema. Cr bumped to 4.6 following
the second cath (likely ATN) and UOP dropped. He was given
hemodialysis and O2 sats and lung exam gradually improved. Once
kidney fxn improved with time he was diuresed with lasix. He
received dye loads with imaging of his LE's and Cr bumped again
so diuresis was slowed but eventually he was successfully
diuresed with Lasix.  Overall Pt volume overloaded but stable.
Needs continued gentle diuresis with lasix.  Pt has responded to
Lasix quite well while hospitalized and should continue to be
diuresed gentle adjusting the Lasix dose as necessary.
*
-C. Rhythm/A fib: When pt was initially admitted he was in NSR.
On [**9-7**] he went into AFib and was started on a heparin gtt.
Cardioversion was attempted on [**9-8**] but was unsuccessful and so
pt was started on Amiodarone. Initially his HR was difficult to
control (120's-130's) and was refractory to max doses of
metoprolol. He was started on digoxin for one day, however, then
he started c/o nausea and it was felt that digoxin would not
likely be a good drug for him. At this point he had the
recurrent CP and was taken back to cath. After cath and the
development of the pericardial effusion, his HR remained in the
70-80's even without metoprolol. He was maintained on the
amiodarone only.  Heparin was stopped when HIT was discovered,
and then amio was stopped when liver enzymes became extremely
elevated. Pt remained in AFib and rates were well controlled
with metoprolol that was again titrated up to 100 po tid.
However, during hospital stay suffered from hypotension at times
requiring cessation of beta blockade.  Pt was restarted on short
acting carvediol and tolerated dose of 3.125 mg po qd. On
discharge, patient a fib seems too be well rate controlled on
his current coreg dose. He will need to be cardioverted as an
outpatient after 4 weeks therapeutic INR.  In regards to
anti-coagulation, Pt's coumadin briefly held secondary to GI
bleed and restarted one week prior to discharge.  INR
supratherapeutic on 5mg po qhd and will be sent home on 3mg po
qhs.  INR will require multiple checks in the upcoming weeks.
*
-D. Peripheral vasculature: Pt was found to be HIT-Ab+ and was
started on argatroban right away. He was ruled out for PE's with
an MRI and hepatic vein thrombosis with abdominal ultrasound. He
did develop ischemic necrosis of his R foot which was felt to be
due to HIT as well as possible cholesterol emboli. He underwent
angioplasty of R Posterior Tibial artery with increased
perfusion. Since patient has diffuse dry gangrene vascular
surgery recommends that he return for follow up in [**2-15**] weeks to
determine if amputation will be necessary. At time of discharge
vascular surgery would consider bypass grafting for which he
needs to follow up after discharge from rehab.  This is no
indication for amputation at this point.  Patient should also
follow up with HEME.
*
2. Pulm: Pt was felt to be hypoxic during this hospitalization
mostly due to pulmonary edema. ABG's remained stable and O2 was
titrated to keep O2sats above 93%. O2sats improved and oxygen
requirements decreased as pt was diuresed. He was felt to have a
possible pneumonia in the middle of his hopitalization that was
treated with ceftriaxone x 10 days. Pt was ventilated for a
prolonged period requiring tracheostomy.  At time of dischage
patient over ventilator support for 5 days requiring on oxygen
by face mask.
*
3. Renal: Pt came in with a Cr of 1.3. His kidney function
remained relatively good until the 2nd cardiac catheterization,
afterwhich the pt was felt to suffer from dye-induced ATN. Cr
bumped to 4.6 and UOP dropped. He was given hemodialysis for
several days in order to keep his fluid status stable. His
kidneys then recovered and UOP rose. Cr trended down. After this
pt was treated with mucomyst before and after all of his dye
related proceudures but Cr bumped up slightly again after
catheterization of R foot occurred. At discharge Pt Cr stable at
1.6, slightly elevated f
