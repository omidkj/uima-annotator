Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

IDENTIFICATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, re-do coronary
artery bypass grafting and hypertension, who presented to an
outside hospital with unstable angina.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:
    a) The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting with a
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery,
a saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery, a
saphenous vein graft to the third obtuse marginal artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
    b) He had re-do coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2170**]
with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending
artery with no bypass grafts to total occlusions of right
coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery grafts.
    c) In [**2172-3-5**], the patient had a stent of the
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery
with a cardiac catheterization showing a left ventricular end
diastolic pressure of 17, an ejection fraction of 42% and mid
inferior akinesis and anterolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.
    d) In [**2172-6-2**], the patient had a percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of a saphenous vein graft
to the left anterior descending artery with a left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 19.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.9.
5.  Hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was doing well post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2172-6-2**].
On [**2172-10-11**], he developed back pain while sitting.
This involved radiation to his left arm and also some
retrosternal chest pain.  He also described some slight
shortness of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.  This
episode of chest pain was not initially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and the patient presented to [**Hospital6 18075**].

At [**Hospital6 2561**], the patient was found to have no
acute electrocardiogram changes and laboratory investigation
showed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, a
hematocrit of 36.6, a platelet count of 291 and a Chem 7
which was within normal limits with a BUN of 50 and a
creatinine of 1.9.  His CK, MB and troponin I were noted to
be 64, 2.6 and 0.2.  His second set of enzymes were also
normal.  The patient was admitted and his chest pain was
treated with nitroglycerin and heparin drips.  He was also
noted to have an asymptomatic run of ventricular tachycardia
of 27 beats without any hemodynamic compromise.  The patient
was started on a lidocaine infusion at that time.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2172-10-14**] and was taken straight to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory.  There, he was found to
have a cardiac output and cardiac index of 3.1 and 1.8
respectively.  His right ventricular end diastolic pressure
was 16 and his pulmonary artery pressures were 48/28 with a
mean of 39.  His wedge pressure was noted to be 29 and his
mixed venous oxygen saturation was 42.  No left ventricular
angiography was done.

Examination of the coronary arteries showed a right dominant
system with a normal left main coronary artery.  There was a
99% lesion at the first obtuse marginal artery and a 100%
lesion at the second obtuse marginal artery.  His
posterolateral ventricular branch was noted to be occluded at
30%.  The right coronary artery, which had a previous known
occlusion, was not injected.  The patient's saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending artery stent was found to
be 98% occluded and the patient underwent balloon
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and subsequent
brachytherapy with a residual occlusion of 10%.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any history of tobacco
use.  He consumed alcohol socially and currently lived alone
without support.  The patient was capable of doing his own
shopping, cooking, cleaning and driving.  He did have a
health care proxy by the name of [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 7049**], who resided
at 74 [**Hospital1 36830**]in [**Hospital1 2436**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  The family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was in no
apparent distress with vital signs showing a temperature of
96.9??????F, a blood pressure of 138/63, a heart rate of 87, a
respiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a
nonrebreather mask.  The neurological examination was
unremarkable.  The patient was awake, alert and oriented
times three.  On head and neck examination, the pupils were
equal and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was moist.

On cardiovascular examination, the patient's jugular venous
pressure was 8-10 cm above the sternal angle.  He had a
normal S1 and S2 with an S3 and S4.  He did not have any
audible murmurs.  The respiratory examination showed diffuse
crackles half way up his chest bilaterally with no wheezes.
The abdominal examination was unremarkable.  The extremities
showed palpable bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses with no
edema.  He had a right groin pulmonary artery catheter line
in place and his arterial sheath site was clean, dry and
intact with no bruit or hematoma.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's cardiac care unit laboratory
values showed a white blood cell count of 14,200, hematocrit
of 27.6 and platelet count of 211,000.  Chem 7 showed a
sodium of 129, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 97, bicarbonate
of 18, BUN of 46, creatinine of 2.1 and glucose of 217.  CK
was 555, calcium was 9.0 and magnesium was 1.6.   Arterial
blood gases showed a pH of 7.33, a pCO2 of 29 and a pO2 of
90.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The patient's electrocardiogram on
[**2172-10-12**] showed him to be in sinus rhythm at 60
with a prolonged P-R interval, a normal P wave and a QRS axis
of -60 to -90.  He also had a right bundle branch block with
a left anterior hemiblock.  He had Q waves noted in leads III
and aVF.  He also had some premature ventricular
contractions.  There were T wave inversions in leads V1 to
V4, which appeared unchanged from his electrocardiogram from
[**2172-7-1**].

RADIOLOGY DATA:  The patient's chest x-ray showed significant
pulmonary vascular redistribution cephalad.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following cardiac catheterization, the
patient was continued on Plavix and received aggressive
diuresis for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
On [**2172-10-15**], the patient was noted to have
continued runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and an
echocardiogram was done, which showed the patient to have a
moderately depressed left ventricular function with 1+ aortic
insufficiency, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  He also was noted to have inferior and
inferoseptal hypokinesis.  The pulmonary artery catheter was
removed along with the introducer on that day.

On [**2172-10-16**], the patient was noted to be in atrial
bigeminy in the morning and also continued to have short runs
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of three to four
beats.  The patient continued with his intravenous diuresis
with 80 mg of Lasix q.d. and was subsequently transferred to
the floor.  On [**2172-10-17**], the electrophysiology
department was informally consulted and the patient's
metoprolol dose was increased.  The patient's rhythm
continued to be monitored.

On [**2172-10-19**], the patient was in stable condition
with adequate diuresis.  His nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia continued to improve and the patient continued to
show no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

The patient was discharged home on [**2172-10-19**] in
stable condition.
