Service:  Cardiology Medicine


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old woman with
a history of complete AV node block as a complication of
mitral valve replacement, controlled by pacemaker, who
developed CHF with dyspnea on exertion and fatigue in [**2165-4-6**]. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated global
hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction
of 30%-40%. She was begun on beta-blocker for the CHF, but
was unable to tolerate the drug secondary to bradycardia and
increased dyspnea. She presented for placement of a dual-
chamber pacemaker, as synchronized AV pacing will improve her
tolerance of beta-blocker and CHF.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Mitral valve prolapse.
2. Rheumatoid heart disease complicated by endocarditis.
3. Mitral valve replacement in [**2155**].
4. VDI pacemaker placement in [**2155**].
5. Asthma.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 98.3, blood
pressure 105/58, heart rate 38, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 98% on room air. General: Awake, alert, in no
acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal, round and reactive to
light and accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Tongue
with serpiginous fissures. No JVD. Heart: Irregular S1 and
S2. No S3-S4 murmurs or rubs. Lungs: Slight crackles of the
bases bilaterally. Clears with deep breath and cough.
Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities: Warm. She had 2+ radial and dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally. No edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram on [**2165-6-25**]: Global
right ventricular hypokinesis with elevated pressure gradient
across mitral valve, elevated pulmonary artery systolic
pressures.

Transesophageal echocardiography on [**2165-6-25**]: Global
right ventricular hypokinesis with large thrombus on mitral
valve.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. AV conduction block: The patient has a history of complete
   AV conduction block as a complication of mitral valve
   replacement in [**2155**]. This was controlled on admission with
   VVI pacemaker; however, given the patient's development of
   CHF over the two months prior to admission and her
   inability to tolerate beta-blocker, she was admitted for
   placement of a biventricular pacemaker for synchronized AV
   pacing.

In preparation for her procedure, the patient's Coumadin was
discontinued,and IV heparin was started to maintain
anticoagulation therapy. She was maintained on IV heparin,
weight-based protocol until her pacer revision was performed
on [**2165-6-24**]. The pacer revision was successful with no
complications. The patient was asymptomatic during this time.

Following her pacemaker revision, the patient's Coumadin was
restarted with a goal INR of greater than 3. IV heparin was
continued until INR was greater than 3, at which time the
heparin was discontinued, and the patient was continued on
her current Coumadin dose.

At the time of discharge, INR was greater than 3, and the
patient was recommended to follow-up with her primary care
physician for continued Coumadin monitoring.

1. CHF: The patient had developed CHF in the two months prior
   to admission with echocardiogram from [**2165-4-6**] showing
   global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection
   fraction of 30%-40%. On admission, she was without
   symptoms of dyspnea or orthopnea. Treatment was continued
   with her outpatient doses of Lasix and Lisinopril with
   good affect.

1. Mitral valve thrombus: During pacemaker interrogation on
   the morning of [**2165-6-25**], the patient became acutely
   dyspneic and was noted to be tachycardiac. Echocardiogram
   was performed showing elevated pressure gradients across
   her mitral valve and global right ventricular hypokinesis.
   Emergent TEE was performed demonstrating a large thrombus
   on the mitral valve.

Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and felt that the
patient was at high operative risk and would be better served
by anticoagulation and thrombolysis. The patient was admitted
to the CCU for treatment and observation and was treated
thrombolytic therapy using alteplase.

Following thrombolysis, repeat echocardiogram demonstrated
disappearance of the mitral valve thrombus. The patient's
symptoms resolved, and she was hemodynamically stable and was
thus called out from the CCU to the medicine floor.

Treatment was continued with IV heparin until Coumadin was
therapeutic with an INR greater than 3 as above. At
discharge, the patient has no dyspnea or signs of pulmonary
edema. She is asymptomatic and is recommended to follow-up
with her primary care physician and with her cardiologist in
[**12-7**] weeks for further evaluation.

At the time of discharge, it is evident that she will require
repeat mitral valve replacement in the near future.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable to go home with close follow-up.

PRIMARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. AV node block.
2. Mitral valve thrombus.
3. Congestive heart failure.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Sertraline 50 mg 2 tab p.o. daily.
2. Warfarin 2 mg 3 tab p.o. q.h.s.


FOLLOW UP:
1. Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-7**] weeks.
2.
   Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in [**12-7**] weeks.
3. Follow-up in cardiology device clinic in one month.
