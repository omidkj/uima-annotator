INDICATION: Respiratory failure and aspiration event.

Left pleural effusion has decreased in size with residual
moderate effusion and adjacent atelectasis remaining. New patchy
and linear right infrahilar opacities have developed, and may be
due to clinically suspected acute aspiration. Cardiomediastinal
contours and indwelling devices appear unchanged.

ECG (5/11/8)
Regular ventricular pacing with probable underlying atrial
fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing ventricular pacing is new.

The patient was transferred from the outside hospital to the
MICU for further observation. His septic shock was treated with
aggressive normal saline IVF boluses, and broadening of his
antibiotic regimen to meropenem, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
