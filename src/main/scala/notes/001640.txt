History of Present Illness:
85M with DM, AFib on coumadin, and recent diagnosis (on [**12-10**])
of cholangitis and cholecystitis s/p ERCP, sphincterotomy, and
distal CBD stone extraction at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-11**] transferred from
[**Hospital3 3583**] for acute blood loss anemia. Periampullary
diverticulum was also noted during ERCP. Initially returned to
[**Hospital3 3583**] post-procedure and did well for the first 24

cholecystectomy but Hct dropped 28%->22% overnight into [**12-13**].

lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, or hematochezia. Underwent EGD
[**12-13**] showing active bleeding at the base of the sphincterotomy
site with blood in the stomach and the duodenum. Treated with SC
epi injection and gold probe BICAP for hemostasis. Tranfused a
total of 3U pRBC prior to transfer.

Upon arrival, patient is without complaints.

IMAGING
============
[**2118-12-13**]
- CXR: There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Left
transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in standard position,
although the tip of the one that goes to the right ventricle is
not visualized. There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema. The
left lateral CP angle was not included on the film. There is no
evidence of large pleural effusions. There are no focal
consolidations.

[**2118-12-14**]
- Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate aortic
regurgitaiton

INTERVENTION
============
[**2118-12-14**]
- ERCP: Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the
major papilla and active bleeding was noted at the apex on the
left side of the sphincterotomy.  Previous cautery marks were
visible at the base of the sphincterotomy. The area was
thoroughly irrigated. Cannulation of the biliary duct was
performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. The
common bile duct, common hepatic duct appeared unremarkable. In
order to keep patency of the CBD,  A 7cm by 10FR Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **]
biliary stent was placed successfully. After insertion of a CBD
stent, approximately 20mL of 1:10,000 epinephrine was injected
at the apex of the sphincterotomy with significant slowing of
the bleeding. Bipolar cautery using a Gold probe was applied at
26Watts with successful complete hemostasis.

[**2118-12-15**]
- IR: The common hepatic arteriogram showed brisk reflux of
contrast into the large splenic artery. There was some
resistance to antegrade flow in the hepatic arteries noted and
intrahepatic arteries were attenuated and irregular consistent
with either edema or possibly changes related to infection
and/or ischemia. A plastic stent was seen in the right upper
quadrant and arterial phase of the gastroduodenal opacification
shows active extravasation from the distal branches of the
pancreaticoduodenal arcade. This corresponds with the expected
site of the ampulla and corresponds to findings at the ERCP.
With the microcatheter out distally, active extravasation was
not seen, but Gelfoam and coil embolization were performed and
final images shows coils proximal and distal to the site of
extravasation. The initial post-embolization showed antegrade
flow at the level of the extravasation though no active bleeding
was seen at that time, however therefore additional embolization
was performed and the final post-embolization arteriogram taken
from the level of the proximal GDA showed no further antegrade
flow in anterior and posterior branches. In addition,
post-embolization study of the superior mesenteric arteries
showed no anterograde flow or extravasation at the area
embolized. More detailed study of the SMA was not performed.
Incidental note is made of pacer wires and tortuosity of the
lower abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.
CONCLUSION:
1. Mesenteric arteriography is showing active contrast
extravasation (bleeding) from the distal branches of the
gastroduodenal artery corresponding to the site of the ampulla.
2. Successful microcoil and Gelfoam embolization proximal and
distal to the site of extravasation with post-embolization
imaging showing no further anterograde flow in this region.
3. Note made of of abnormal hepatic arterial supply the branch
