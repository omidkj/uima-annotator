Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, trach, PEG

History of Present Illness:
67yoM with Parkinson's disease, Bipolar disorder, HTN,
dyslipidemia, right vertebral artery aneurysm who presents for
hypoxia.
.
Per ED report and per the patient's sister's report (who spoke
directly to the nurses who were taking care of the patient
today), the patient was in his usual state of health at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab and had just eaten breakfast and was waiting to be wheeled
to his room for his routine nap. The nurse turned away to finish
feeding another patient and turned back to see the patient with
emesis coming out of his nose and mouth. The patient was
unresponsive during this episode and was rapidly suctioned.
However, he was hypoxic and EMS was called who found the patient
to be hypoxic en route to the ED and bag masked and ventilated
for initial apnea, per report. He was lethargic en route and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. There was no
reports of fevers or symptoms preceeding the event, but the
sister states that the patient does not typically complain of
symptoms even when he feels unwell. The patient's sister reports
the patient has never had difficulties with swallowing or
eating, and has never had an aspiration episode in the past.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 99.6 (rectal) 67 132/94 91% NRB
The patient was reportedly not responsive to commands and had
coarse rales diffusely. He was given Vanc/Levofloxacin/Flagyl in
the ED and intubated for hypoxia. EKG showed sinus rhythm at
62bpm without evidence of acute ischemia. CXR was obtained which
showed possible RML infiltrate. CTA chest was obtained to r/o PE
which instead showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia. CT head
showed enlargement of the patient's known right vertebral artery
aneurysm, and Neurology and Neurosurgery were consulted out of
concern that the intracranial aneurysm could be contributing to
his symptoms. Neurosurgery recommended MRI head/neck and
Neurology planned to have the stroke consult see him in the AM
pending MRI/MRA results. He was transferred to the MICU for
further management. Transfer vitals were: 84 109/68 19 100% TV
500 PEEP 8 RR 20 FiO2 100
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was minimally responsive to
pain off sedation after having received paralytics. He went to
for the MRI/MRA during which time his respiratory rate increased
and sedation was initiated with Propofol boluses, then a low
dose gtt. He became fully responsive to commands and his
respiratory rate and blood pressures increased on CMV/AC.


Past Medical History:
- HTN
- Hyperlipidemia
- Bipolar disorder

- Unruptured right vertebral artery aneurysm (CTA from an
outside facility was reviewed; right vertebral artery aneurysm,
longest dimension 9-10 mm located intradurally in the region of
the right vertebral artery. He could not becertain whether the
aneurysm involved the PICA origin, but most likely it seemed to
be separate from it.)

REPORTS:

CXR AP [**2103-6-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Standard position of endotracheal tube.
2. Nasogastric tube extends below level of diaphragm, but
inferior aspect not well seen. Consider repeat if desire to
confirm that it terminates in the stomach.
3. Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.

CT Head [**2103-6-23**]
1. Interval increased size of a right-sided vertebral artery
aneurysm with
increased mass effect upon the brainstem. CTA should be
considered for
further evaluation.
2. Parenchymal atrophy and small vessel ischemic disease. No
other acute
findings.

CTA Chest [**2103-6-23**]
1. Bibasilar, and perihilar opacities with peribronchial
thickening may
reflect aspiration pneumonia. Hilar lymph nodes may be reactive.

2. No pulmonary embolism.
3. NG tube tip at the GE junction and should be further advanced
to achieve gastric positioning.

MRA Head/Neck [**2103-6-23**]
IMPRESSION: Right vertebral artery aneurysm at the V3 segment,
apparently
partially thrombosed, the carotid bifurcations and the left
vertebral artery are grossly normal.

CTA Head w and w/o contrast [**2103-7-7**] (prelim read!) - (Final
report dictation confirms preliminary findings.)
1. Right vertebral artery aneurysm measuring smaller on CTA than
routine head CT - likely secondary to differences in technique.
Difficult to measure on non-contrast images due to artifact.
Continues to demonstrate compression on the brainstem.
Reconstructions pending at this time.
2. No evidence for other aneurysm, vascular malformation or
proximal large
arterial occlusion.
3. New fluid in mastoid air cells bilaterally, may be secondary
to recent
intubation and supine positioning. Clinical correlation
recommended.
