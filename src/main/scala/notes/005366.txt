Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72F w/ HTN p/w sudden progressive SOB and orthopnea x 3days. no
cp. no palps. Pt has long hx of labile BP and hyponatremia. 6
weeks ago, pt was switched from HCTZ to Lasix for hyponatremia.
Pt did not tolerate Lasix as she did not like having a dry mouth
while on it and was switched to chlorthalidone. This was stopped
last Wednesday [**7-10**] [**1-24**] low Na. Admits to some b/l pedal edema
that has been improving since decreasing dose of felodipine. Now
complains of muscle pain on inspiration which started today
after exerting herself (climbing into a vehicle). Has been
coughing for past two days, non productive, no hemoptysis. Per
pt, had a temp of 100 this am and had chills. Took Tylenol
before coming to the ED.

ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults):
- Initial Vitals/Trigger: hypoxic to low- to mid-80s on RA
- CXR: bilat fluffy infiltrates but pt reports fever so tx for
PNA
- CAP coverage for ICU admit w/addition of doxy to tx for
potential tularemia given recent [**Hospital3 **] visit
-1L bolus
-azithro and ceftriaxone

Initial VS in the ED were T97.6 HR76 BP 196/85 RR20 satting 94%.
 Labs showed WBC of 18.3 with 87.5 PMN's, HCT of 34, plt of 485.
 ProBNP was checked and was 4968.  Metabolic panel showed sodium
of 130, chloride of 91, and BUN of 22, creatinine of 1.1,
potassium of 4.4 and bicarbonate of 27.  ABG showed pH of 7.36
with pCO2 of 47 and pO2 on 74 on NRB.  Troponins were negative x
1.  Patient was provided with a baby aspirin.  CxR was performed
which showed pulmonary edema with basilar opacity and likely
atelectasis. No pneumothorax was noted and heart size appeared
stable. Left and possibly small right effusions were noted.  EKG
showed Q waves in III as well as V1-3 with inverted TW in
V1/V2...

Given necessity for NRB, patient was transferred to the ICU for
further care.

On arrival to the MICU, stabilized and saturating low to mid 90s
with NRB. Given zofran for nausea.

MICRO:
[**2126-7-15**] Blood cultures: no growth to date
[**2126-7-16**] Urine culture: no growth
.
IMAGING:
[**2126-7-15**] CXR: There is pulmonary edema with basilar opacity
likely atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Heart size appears stable.
Left effusion, possibly small right effusion noted.
.
[**2126-7-16**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2124-5-29**], the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is now higher. There is now borderline tissue
Doppler/mitral inflow evidence of high left ventricular
diastolic filling pressures.
.
[**2126-7-17**] CT Chest w/o con:
1. Mild residual pulmonary edema can explain the lung opacities
and pleural effusion. Considering the rapid evolution of the
opacities, it is certainly the privileged diagnosis.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded but is less likely.
2. Left renal lesions, probably cysts, but a son[**Name (NI) **] is
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old woman with a history of HTN and pulmonary HTN who
presents with SOB and hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxia, SOB: CHF versus pneumonia were on differentials.
Pneumonia was considered with pt's history of progressively
worsening cough and shortness of breath with leukocytosis and
subjective fevers. On hospital Day 2, pt was febrile to 101F and
was started on Levaquin. CXR shows pleural effusions but no
lobar consolidations, and given that pt recently stopped
diuretics, it was likely pt was fluid overloaded. This was
supported by pt's elevated BNP. TTE showed moderate mitral
regurgitation and pulmonary hyptertension (stable from prior).
Pt was diuresed with Lasix and given captopril for BP control
but was discontinued after UOP decreased and creatinine
increased. Pt did well with antibiotic and her oxygen
supplementation was weaned. She was discharged on levofloxacin
to complete a 7-day course, as well as furosemide 10mg daily
until she sees her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**7-25**].
.
# HTN: Pt was on felodipine, atenolol and Losartan as an
outpatient. Pt came in with SBP in 190s and we continued
felodipine and started TID captopril. On hospital day 2 pt
became oliguric and Cr bump to 1.3 and thus stopped captopril.
SBP in 130s and we restarted home atenolol. Once [**Last Name (un) **] resolved,
