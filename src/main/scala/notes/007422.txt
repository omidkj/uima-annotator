Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Bleeding right abdominal wound

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Vac on left abdominal wound to be replaced by plastics, wet to
dry dressings on right abdominal wound

History of Present Illness:
55 yo F, with PMH IDDM x 27 yrs, presents with a spontaneously
bleeding R abdominal wound.  Today at 1 pm, pt was lying in bed
and noticed wet bedsheets, and realized that the bedsheets was
drenched in bright red blood.  The bleeding stopped for a few
hours, and then re-started again at 4 pm.  Total blood loss was
estimated as 1000 ml as per patient.  Pt is morbidly obese.
.
Patient has several areas of skin breakdown on abdomen and
sacrum, but most severe are 2 abdominal wounds, one on R lateral
abdomen, one on L lateral abdomen.  In mid-[**2102-4-4**], patient
originally presented with an abdominal wall soft tissue
infectionover her bilateral lower quadrants, L>R.  Two weeks
after noticing the lesions, she presented to her PCP after they
grew in size.  The lesions started draining yellowing malodorous
fluid.  She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2102-5-30**].
.
The L wound more than the R wound was debrided on [**2102-5-31**] at
[**Hospital 1110**] [**Hospital **] Hospital.  The tissue sample at time of
debridement was consistent with "atherosclerosis obliterans with
necrotizing gangrene" as per pathology report.  The wound was
healing well initially, but then patient developed more
extensive tunneling necrosis.  The wound was cultured and grew
out MSSA and Citrobacter.  She was started on IV unasyn, on
which she remained from [**5-31**] to [**2102-6-7**], and was discharged home
on no antibiotics.
.
Both wounds were debrided at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2102-6-26**], as an outpatient.
 She re-presented on [**2102-7-4**] with recrudescence and extension of
her wound from the abdomen down to her LE bilaterally.  She was
started on IV unasyn.  She had also been treated for chronic
renal insufficiency, anemia (received rbcs and epo).  Upon
discharge, patient complained only of minor throbbing pain
associated with the abdominal lesions, slight nausea, and poor
appetite.
.
Both wounds were debrided last Friday at [**Hospital1 18**].  Pt is staying
at [**Hospital 1110**] Rehab Hospital since the end of [**2102-6-4**].  She was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER after receiving one unit of pRBC.  Pt
vomited today, no blood, no mucus.
.
Pt had no fever, chills, cough, runny nose, sore throat,
headache, dizziness, chest pain, SOB.  Pt has had no diarrhea or
constipation, no dysuria or urinary urgency.  She has no
arthralgias or myalgias.  Pt has had normal appetite, and is
independently ambulatory if she may be helped to her feet.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  ABDOMINAL WOUNDS:
The patient's abdominal wounds were each approximately 10x14x10
cm, on lateral sides of the abdomen.  The right wound had
initially presented with profuse bleeding, which was stopped
with suture of the vessel by plastics.  1 unit RBC was
transfused before admission.  The wounds were diagnosed as
likely calciphylaxis, due to disposition and risk factors of
patient.  The wound biopsy report did note, however, that there
was focal calcification around vessels rather than medial
calcification characteristic of calciphylaxis.  Plastic surgery
recommended no further debridement for the wounds, since
previous debridements had simply left larger wounds which had
not healed.
.
The pt's abdominal wounds were chronically colonized with
bacteria.  Two wound cultures revealed presence of Enterococcus,
Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas in both wounds.  The wounds
improved initially in draining much less purulent material, and
wet to dry dressings TID to QID were far less green and yellow.
Dressing changes revealed clear serosanguinous drainage with
streaks of pale green.  Throughout the pt's course on the floor,
the pt was on Augmentin, Unasyn, Cipro, Vanco, Tobra, Zosyn,
Gent.  Infectious disease consult reported that wounds were
likely colonized, and thus all abx were stopped.
.
Significantly, from [**Date range (1) 61844**]/05, pt's wounds started evolving
and becoming worse.  The wounds had always been black and
necrotic, but erythema started extending onto the skin around
the wounds, and large blistering of the skin started occurring
around the edges of the wounds.  The pt had not needed pain
medications for wound changes until these last 7-10 days, when
wound changes became very painful.
.
There were multiple areas of skin breakdown on the pt's body,
including a total of 18 areas of skin breakdown.  Other
significant areas of skin breakdown included the medial areas of
the proximal LEs, where there was extensive large blistering and
denudation of the epithelial layer, sacral and spinous ulcers,
and a large R heel ulcer.
.
2.  ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:
Pt had a chronic severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, presumed
to be from uremia and lactic acidosis, as well as a
hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, presumed to be from chronic
episodic vomiting QOD from uremia.  The pt's metabolic acidosis
was extremely difficult to control.  Etiologies of chronic renal
insufficiency were diabetes mellitus type 2 and HTN.
.
Significantly, from [**Date range (1) 61844**]/05, the pt's Cr rose from 3.5 to
6.7, and pt rapidly went into acute anuric renal failure.
Etiology of acute on chronic renal failure was not identified.
Pt was not prerenal, but urine eosinophils were present.  Renal
US was not done due to habitus of pt and likely difficulty in
interpreting results.  Renal biopsy was also not performed, due
to pt's gradually increasing INR and risk of gross hemorrhage,
and also because pt would not be a viable candidate for steroid
treatment, and thus the endpoint of treatment for pt would
likely include dialysis.
.
3.  LEUKOCYTOCLASTIC VASCULITIS:
On admission, pt had a chronic, moderate morbilliform pustular,
non-pruritic rash on her shoulders, proximal UEs, and upper
back.
.
On [**2102-8-9**], pt started developing a palpable, erythematous,
pruritic maculopapular rash predominantly on her shoulders and
arms, but also on her back, trunk, and upper abdomen, that
evolved into urticarial lesions over one day, and then evolved
into a confluent, erythematous, diffuse, non-palpable, pruritic
maculopapular rash with desquamation around her wrists,
