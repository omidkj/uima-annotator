IMAGING & STUDIES:
------------------
[**2164-4-3**] EGD/ Esophageal stent placement: A slight narrowing was
noted in the mid/upper esophagus at 26 cm likely corresponding
to known anastamotic stricture. Once anastamotic stricture was
traversed there was a large saccular area identified which was
ulcerated and friable - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], this represents the
gastric conduit. Again identified was a 1-2 mm area concerning
for fistula. After extensive discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], decision
was made to place a fully covered metal stent to attempt closure
of the fistula and symptom control. A 23 mm x 155 mm Wallflex
Esohpagael fully covered metal stent [Ref# 1675; Lot# [**Serial Number 6548**]]
was placed successfully into the esophagus under fluoroscopic
guidance.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent Laparoscopic jejunostomy
feeding tube placement, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and balloon
dilation of stricture to 18 mm., Biopsy of gastric conduit and
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.  He tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.

After full recovery from anesthesia, he transferred to the
surgical floor and was evaluated by the GI service for possible
stent placement for the stricture and also to help heal a
possible fistulous tract.  He was taken to the GI suite on
[**2164-4-3**] for placement of a metal stent.  He tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the Surgical floor in stable
condition.

The Nutrition service evaluated his nutritional needs and
recommended Isosource 1.5 to be cycled at 120 mls/hr over a 12
hour period.  His feedings were started slowly and advanced and
tolerated well.  His pre admission Lovenox was also started for
atrial fibrillation and DVT.  As his beta blocker was held for
48 hours he had some problems with RAF to 150 after ambulation.
His beta blocker was resumed and his rate returned to sinus
rhythm at 86 BPM.

He had no abdominal pain and his j tube site was clean.  He was
reluctant to eat much due to his recent problems but realizes
that he can have food if he desires.  Home care was arranged
with VNA, oxygen therapy and tube feeding capabilities.  He was
discharged to home on [**2164-4-8**].
