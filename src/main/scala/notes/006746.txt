CXR:
[**2150-2-19**]:  Interval worsening of fluid overload. Persistent left
lower lobe
atelectasis.
[**2150-2-18**]
Interval worsening of the findings with more pronounced left
retrocardiac
opacity and enlarging left-sided opacity probably represent a
combination of atelectasis, pneumonia.
2. Interval worsening of patchy interstitial opacities
particularly on the
right side and this may suggest failure. The patient's
interstitial lung
disease on CT is noted, however, that within the last
appearances appear
slightly worse when compared to prior radiograph.
