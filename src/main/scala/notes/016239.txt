Brief Hospital Course:
Transfered for cardiac evaluation and underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed no significant coronary artery
disease.  She was referred for surgical evaluation due to aortic
stenosis.  She underwent preoperative workup and was brought to
the operating [**2126-11-8**] for aortic valve replacement.  See
operative report for further details. Vancomycin was given for
perioperative antibiotics and she was transferred to the
intensive care unit for post operative management.  She remained
intubated due to hemodynamics and oxygenation.  On post
operative day one she was weaned but required increased PEEP and
was gently diuresed due to volume overload and remained
intubated. On postoperative day two she was weaned and extubated
and continued with lasix for diuresis.  Additionally she had
thrombocytopenia post operative day one, lines were changed to
heparin free, HITT was sent which was negative, and platelet
count was monitored and increased to > 70 on post operative day
4, epicardial wires were then removed.  She was started on
betablockers that were titrated up and ACE inhibitor was started
for blood pressure management.  She continued to progress and
was screened for rehab - she was ready for discharge post
operative day 5 to [**Location (un) **] of [**Location (un) 701**].
Her aggrenox was not resumed due to platelet count
