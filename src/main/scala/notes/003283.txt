Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated

History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 86 y/o F who presented to [**Hospital6 **] after
3 falls at home on [**2155-12-8**]. Details of the falls were related by
her grandson, [**Name (NI) 401**] [**Name (NI) 31469**]. He reports that the patient was unable
to walk because of weakness on the left side. She fell getting
out of bed on [**2155-12-8**], 45 minutes later in the bathroom, and
again at the breakfast table shortly thereafter. The grandson
noted that the patient couldn't use her walker at all secondary
to weakness after the third fall. Son arrived and picked patient
up off floor. Noted L sided weakness and called EMS. Left facial
droop
was noted but this was this is somewhat confounded by an old
bells palsy. At [**Hospital3 **], serial head CTs demonstrated
worsening R intraparenchymal bleed. She was sent here for
further care.  She was admitted to the TSICU and was noted to be
increasingly drowsy and a CT head was done this morning which
showed worsening from previous CT.

Head CT [**12-9**]:
1. Significantly limited study due to patient movement. Large
parenchymal hemorrhage in the posterior right parietal lobe with
local mass effect. Apparent effacement along the right
suprasellar cistern likely represents volume averaging due to
motion, however, evolving uncal herniation is not entirely
excluded. Attention to this finding on follow-up imaging is
recommended.
2. Diffuse white matter hypodensity throughout the bilateral
basal ganglia, likely sequela of severe chronic microvascular
ischemia, less likely infarction.

Repeat Head CT [**12-9**]:
1. Interval increase in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
within the right parietal lobe. Worsening of right lateral
ventricle mass effect.
2. No subfalcine or uncal herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31469**] was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring. She
was treated with mannitol and dilantin. Her systolic blood
pressure was maintained between 120-160 with a Map < 130. She
was also maintained normothermic and normoglycemic.

In the morning she was noted to be increasingly drowsy,
disproportionately to her initial lesion on CT. Her dilantin was
stopped and she was sent for a repeat CT. This showed new
bleeding extending into the ventricles and worsening edema. She
was started on mannitol. Neurosurgery was also consulted to
evaluate for possible interventions including a drain. They felt
that she was not a surgical candidate.
These finding were discussed at length with the family by both
neurology and the ICU service.
The family discussed their goals of care. The children wanted
their mother to be [**Name (NI) 3225**], however her husband wanted her to be
full code. Shortly after this discussion, she was noted to have
agonal breathing. She was therefore intubated.

After the intubation, the family and a further discussion
regarding their goals of care. Mr. [**Known lastname 31469**] decided to make his
wife [**Name (NI) 3225**]. She was extubated and started on morphine and
scopolamine for comfort. The patient expired ~12hrs later.
