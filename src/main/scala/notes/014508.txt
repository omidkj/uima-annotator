Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year old man with HTLV-1 induced paraplegia and
depression/suicide attempts and decubitus ulcers who presents
with temperature to 101.2 degrees at nursing home, as well as
loose stools and abdominal destension with no stool in the
rectal vault. He had recently been diagnosed with bibaslilar
pneumonia on [**2183-4-28**] and E coli UTI. He got tylenol for this and
was sent to the ED at [**Hospital1 882**]. A CT scan showed colitis. He was
 transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when the ED went off diversion.
.
In the ED he was afebrile with initially hypertensive blood
pressures that fell to the 80's systolic without intervention.
He got 5 liters of normal saline. Two peripheral IV's were
placed and he was considered for a central line but was
hemodynamically stable after this. Blood cultures were drawn and
he was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl. He was
clinically felt to have an infection and possible bowel
obstruction. Surgery was consulted and recommended CT scan,
which showed no colitis. The recommendation was to send stool
for C dif. In addition, plastic surgery was consulted for
decubitus ulcers and felt there was no clear evidence of
cellulitis, and recommended changing dressings twice daily.
.
He says he felt warm at [**Hospital 883**] hospital but not at the [**Hospital1 **]. He
has no complaints of abdominal pain, diarrhea, SOB, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, chills. He wants to return to the home and
doesn't understand medically why he needs to stay here.

Physical Exam:
T98.3 BP 131/70 P82 R19 94% RA
Gen: no apparent distress, conversational
HEENT: PERRLA, MM dry
Resp: rhonchi at bases bilaterally
CV: RRR nlo s1s2 no MGR
Abd: soft, NT +resonant +slight distension +BS
Ext: no cyanosis, clubbing, edema
Neuro: A+Ox3. moves upper extremities well. LE hyperreflexic
bilaterally
Back: patient refused examination of his decubitus ulcers,
saying it hurts too much to turn over


Pertinent Results:
CXR: Left lower lobe collapse and less severe atelectasis in the
right lower lobe are new.  Peribronchial opacification in the
suprahilar right lung could be pneumonia.  Vascular deficiency
in the upper lungs, exacerbated on the left by lower lobe
collapse, indicates emphysema.  Heart is normal size.  There is
no significant pleural effusion or other evidence of cardiac
decompensation. Intestines and the upper abdomen are moderately
to severely distended with gas.
.
Abd CT [**2183-5-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  No dilatation or wall thickening of colon to suggest the
presence of colitis.
2.  Cholelithiasis with a possible pericholecystic fluid.  An
ultrasound could be performed for further evaluation if there is
clinical concern for cholecystitis.
3.  Opacity at both lung bases representing consolidation versus
less likely atelectasis.
4.  Sub-5-mm non-calcified pulmonary nodules at the right lung
base.  Given the presence of calcified granulomas in the right
lung base, a followup chest CT could be performed in one year if
clinically warranted.
5.  Unchanged decubital ulcer extending to the posterior aspect
of the sacrum compared to [**2182-2-27**].
6.  Single prominent loop of small bowel in the central abdomen
with no evidence of obstruction or bowel wall thickening.
.
RUQ ultrasound:
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  The liver is normal in
echotexture without focal hepatic mass.  Some mild prominence of
the right intrahepatic biliary duct without overt distention.
The main portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal
flow.  The common bile duct measures up to 6 mm.  The
gallbladder is moderately distended.  Some tenderness is present
about the gallbladder, more so than in adjacent areas.  There is
layering sludge within the neck of the gallbladder and multiple
large shadowing stones.  There is diffuse bladder wall
thickening with intraluminal edema in some areas with a
maximal wall thickness of up to 8 mm in the fundus.  There is
urrounding pericholecystic fluid.  No perihepatic ascites is
identified.  Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no
hydronephrosis or calculi.
.
IMPRESSION:  High suspicion for cholecystitis. (*Note - surgery
diagrees with this interpretation on clinical grounds and
reviewed scan)

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old man presented with fever, hypotension, and abdominal
distension.  The patient was admitted to the MICU after being
briefly hypotensive in the ED.
.
#) fever, hypotension - Patient hemodynamically stable upon
admission to MICU.  Although it was concerning for sepsis, his
pressure normalized with IVF, so patient is not in septic shock.
 It was thought that he may have a component of autonomic
dysfunction as well given his paraplegia.  Cultures were sent,
and were still pending at the time of discharge.  The patient
had a slightly positive UA, and had recently been on Cefpodoxime
for UTI treatment.  Given this recent abx use, C-diff may also
be a possibility, although patient is afebrile without a
leukocytosis.  His abdominal exam is completely benign, and
imaging thought to not be consistent with active infection.  The
patient was initially continued on Vanc, Levo, and Flagyl, but
after being afebrile and hemodynamically stable x 24 hours, the
antibiotics were weaned to only coverage for the UTI.  He was
started back opn Cefpodoxime to complete a fourteen day course
which he should continue upon discharge.
.
#) Abdominal distension - He was evaluated by surgery who felt
the patient does not have an acute abdomen and does not have
acute cholecystitis, rather he has a collapsed, calcified,
uninflamed gallbladdes. Alk Phos slightly elevated but could be
from bone destruction given GGT normal.  ESR and CRP mildly
elevated, not suggestive of osteomyelitis or other significant
inflammation/infection.  The patient tolerated clears well and
was quickly advanced to a normal diet.  It was felt that he may
have c-Diff given his recent antibiotics, and a stool sample was
sent.
.
#) sacral decubitus ulcers - He
