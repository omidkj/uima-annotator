CODE STATUS:  Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post pericardial window placement
and pericardial fluid drainage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old white male
with a past medical history of multiple medical problems
including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation,
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of about 20%,
multiple cancers, pericardial effusion, now status post
cardiothoracic surgery for pericardial window and drainage.
The patient had been feeling weak for several months and was
admitted to a hospital in [**State 792**]with negative workup.
The beginning of [**Month (only) 205**] he had complaint of shoulder pain,
vague chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient was
ruled out for myocardial infarction and had P-MIBI which was
unchanged from prior study of [**2097-12-2**] which showed a
reversible inferior wall defect.  The patient was treated for
pneumonia at this time with a two week course of Levaquin
which was discontinued on [**8-29**].  The patient continued to
the hospital on [**9-7**], with continued weakness, chest pain
for about one hour and shortness of breath.  Chest x-ray at
the time showed larger bilateral effusions from the prior
study and a computerized axial tomography scan of the chest
showed a large pericardial effusion, small pleural effusion,
nonspecific mediastinal lymphadenopathy and no evidence of
pneumonia.  The patient was increased for increased shortness
of breath and increased effusion, despite recent antibiotic
treatment.

Laboratory studies on admission [**9-7**], showed white count
of 18.8, hematocrit 30.2, sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride
105, bicarbonate 28, BUN 26, creatinine 1.4, negative cardiac
enzymes.  In the hospital the patient continued to have
shortness of breath despite aggressive diuresis.  Chest x-ray
of [**2101-9-10**] showed increased cardiac silhouette
consistent with cardiac tamponade.  Pericardial effusion was
drained.  About 550 cc of straw colored fluid were removed,
no organisms, acid fast bacillus negative.  1358 white blood
cells, 8,025 red blood cells, 46% polys, 33% lymphocytes, all
cultures negative.  The patient continued to have congestive
heart failure-like picture despite aggressive diuresis and
developed decreased urine output with a fractional sodium
excretion of less than 1%.  Another echocardiogram was
performed which showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 30% on
[**2101-9-10**], moderate effusion and no tamponade.  The
patient went to Cardiothoracic Surgery for pericardial window
and pericardial biopsy on the day of transfer and in surgery
minimal effusion was drained, although most recent the day
before surgery [**9-14**], shows reaccummulation of pericardial
fluid consistent with blood.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  World War II concentration camp survivor
times six years from [**Country 532**], retired industry professor,
tobacco use 50 to 100 pack years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient complaining of mild
epigastric tenderness at surgical site, no complaints of
chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient feels sleepy.
Vital signs revealed temperature 97.9, blood pressure 130/70,
pulse 82, respirations 20, 94% on 1.5 liters per nasal
cannula.  General, large male, sleepy but arousable in no
distress.  Neurological, alert and oriented times three.
Answers questions appropriately but slowly.  Pulmonary, loud
breathsounds, fine crackles at the left base.  Coronary,
heartsounds distant, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops are heard.  Abdomen, tender to mild palpation in the
epigastrium, large ventral hernia, large midline surgical
scar, positive bowel sounds, no rebound and no guarding.
Extremities, trace edema over ankles, +[**3-12**], dorsalis pedis
pulse bilaterally, feet warm.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat, oral mucosa moist, no injections seen, extraocular
motions intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - The patient had Beta
blocker and ACE inhibitor slowly titrated over the hospital
course from 6.5 mg b.i.d. of Carvedilol to a final dose of 25
mg b.i.d. for Carvedilol.  The patient was initially switched
to Zestril 20 mg q.d. and titrated up to Zestril 40 mg q.d.
The patient tolerated titration well.  Heartrate and blood
pressure were stable at all times.  The patient at all times
was chestpain free.  The patient was not noted to have any
changes in electrocardiogram.  The patient was noted to have
paced rhythm.  The patient had pericardial biopsy at time of
pericardial window placement.  Pericardial fluid cytology
revealed no malignant cells, numerous neutrophils and
lymphocytes, acid fast bacillus staining of pericardium was
negative.  Pericardial biopsy revealed resolving fibrinous
pericarditis with underlying chronic inflammation, possible
etiologies offered are:  1.  Fungal/viral/bacterial
infection, not tuberculosis; 2.  Trauma; 3.  Uremia although
does not usually present with chronic inflammation; 4.  Post
myocardial infarction changes; 5.  Connective tissue
disorder, rheumatologic; 6.  Drug reaction, again not usually
seen with chronic inflammation.  The patient is known to have
atrial fibrillation on chronic anticoagulation.  Warfarin was
stopped for cardiothoracic surgery, however, it was restarted
at 10 mg q.h.s.  INR was slowly rising during the hospital
course to 1.7 on [**2101-9-21**].  The patient was initially
short of breath but this slowly resolved with continued
diuresis, ACE inhibitor and Beta blocker.  The patient had
good urine output throughout the hospital course and
tolerated diuresis well.

Pulmonary - The patient had repeat chest x-ray on [**9-16**]
with lateral decubitus films which showed bilateral pleural
effusion, persistent pericardial effusion with findings
consistent with tamponade and systemic venous congestion, no
evidence of pulmonary venous congestion.  The patient
continued to be short of breath throughout hospital course,
however, resolved somewhat later on in the stay, eventually
not requiring oxygen per nasal cannula to be comfortable with
eventual pulse oximetry of 100% on room air.

Rheumatologic - The patient was found to be [**Doctor First Name **] negative.

Endocrine - The patient was known to be hypothyroid.
Levothyroxine 75 mcg q.d. was continued throughout hospital
course.  TSH was checked once and was found to be 1.
