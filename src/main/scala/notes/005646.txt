PBC s/p OLT on immunosuppression presented to [**Hospital1 **] with
tachycardia and chest pain. Her afib started acutely today
accompanied by full left sided chest discomfort. She was feeling
generally unwell prior but attributed this to her procedure on

Patient was given amiodarone 150mg bolus. Chest pain resolved
with rate control to HR 110-120 and BP 80s/60s. EP fellow
recommended cardioversion. Patient was cardioverted with 50J,
and converted to sinus rhythm (per report with wandering atrial
pacemaker with diffuse TWI), and HR 60s-70s with BP 90-100s
systolic. Initial trop before cardioversion was elevated at
0.143. She was chest pain free prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

which the patient was asymptomatic. There were no changes made
to her medication regimen. She also had a recent TEE on [**11-30**]
for unclear reasons.

the cardioversion but otherwise denied SOB. She received 4L of
IVF total and approximately 500mg of amio bolus + gtt which
stopped at 0115. Most Recent Vitals: 0215: 48-59 af- 15-

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female with history of persistent Afib s/p multiple
ablations, atypical aflutter s/p isthmus line and PVI [**8-/2117**],
HOCM, AAA, and PBC s/p OLT on immunosuppression admitted for
atrial tachycardia s/p cardioversion and ablation at OSH.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient reportedly had episode of Atrial tachycardia
at OSH. She was cardioverted back into sinus rhythm and loaded
with amiodarone. Subsequently patient was hypotensive and she
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further monitoring. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] patient was normotensive with sinus bradycardia. She was
started on amiodarone 200 mg po BID. The plan is to continue
this dose for 1 month, then decrease to amiodarone 200 mg daily.
She will have an outpatient ablation procedure scheduled. She
was discharged on her home warfarin dose. Her metoprolol was
decreased to 25 mg daily.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient has no prior history of CAD. Her last
stress in [**2113**] was normal. She initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**]
with chest pain and palpitations. Chest pain resolved with rate
control. ECG showed no evidence of active ischemia. Troponins
were stable at 0.13 x 2 with normal CKMB. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
patient was chest pain free and remained chest pain free through
the remainder of admission.
.
# PUMP: Appeared euvolemic on exam. EF>55%. She was continued on
her home spironolactone. Metoprolol was decreased to 25 mg daily
at time of discharge given her bradycardia.
.
# Hypertension: Patient initially hypotensive after
cardioversion and amiodarone at OSH. She was given fluids and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival to the floor, systolic blood
pressures in low 100s. Patient's blood pressures remained stable
throughout admission. Her lisinopril was held at discharge.
.
# S/p Liver transplant: Patient continued on home doses of
CellCept and Tacrolimus.
.
# Suspected AI: continue prednisone taper
.
# Thrombocytopenia: chronic
.
Transitional Issues
- Patient will need outpatient ablation procedure
- Patient will need blood pressure rechecked. If elevated can
consider restarting lisinopril.
- Heart rate will need to be monitored. Metoprolol may need to
be increased.
- No labs pending at time of discharge.
- Patient full code on admission
