Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Persistent fevers, dyspnea, and productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo man with history of IPF and hypertension
who presents with persistent cough.  He first developed symptoms
about 2 months prior to presentation.  At that time he had fever
up to 102, cough, wheezing, fatigue, and dyspnea.  He was
treated with a course of Azithromycin, followed by a four-day
Prednisone taper.  This combination improved his fevers, and he
is now not mounting fevers higher than 99.  His symptoms,
however, have persisted.  He was started on Levofloxacin in late
[**Month (only) 958**] for four days, and he was seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**]
at that time.  PFTs showed a mild restrictive defect that was
worse than his last testing in [**Month (only) **].  He also had a CT chest
that showed an area of consolidation in the left lung, felt to
be most compatible with a pneumonia.  His fibrotic changes had
worsened compared to his last chest CT scan from 3 years prior.
He was instructed to complete one week of Levofloxacin followed
by a week of Moxifloxacin, and Augmentin was added to his
regimen as well.

The patient was seen again in clinic today on an urgent basis
for evaluation of persistent low-grade fevers, dyspnea, and
coughing.  He reports temps ranging from 99-100.8 over the past
2-3 weeks.  Productive cough in the AM with alternating clear or
yellow and occasionally blood-tinged sputum.  He has had
progressive DOE.  Also weight loss of about 10lbs over the past
5-6 weeks.  In the clinic, his temp was 99.6, O2 sat of 94% on
2L (baseline 95% on RA).  A CXR suggested worsening infiltrate
on the left.  Blood work was notable for elevated WBC of 11.8
with a left-shift.  Blood and sputum cultures were sent.  He was
direct admitted to the medicine service for further management
including broader antibiotic therapy.

IMAGING:
[**2119-3-21**] CXR (PA and lat):
IMPRESSION:
Persistent peripheral consolidation although slightly improved
since the
recent CT in [**2119-2-13**] with background changes of known IPF.

[**2119-3-23**] CT chest w/o contrast:
1. Enlargement of left upper lobe opacity, with increasing
mass-like
configuration and displacement and narrowing of the left upper
lobe bronchus. The appearance is concerning for a primary lung
cancer, particularly considering increasing size of
aorticopulmonary window and left hilar lymphadenopathy, as well
as a new lytic lesion at T12. This lesion would be amenable to
either bronchoscopic or transthoracic needle biopsy.
2. New widespread areas of ground-glass opacification in the mid
and lower lungs bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes
pulmonary hemorrhage (the patient reportedly is experiencing
hemoptysis), opportunistic infection, and acute exacerbation of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

[**2119-4-3**] CXR (portable):
AP chest compared to [**3-24**] through 18:

Widespread infiltrative abnormality in the right lung has
worsened
progressively since [**3-30**] after some earlier improvement.
This is more
likely to be infection or hemorrhage than edema, given that
course. Mass at the periphery of the left lung is unchanged.
Heart size top normal. Pleural effusions are minimal if any. No
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, who presented with
persistent low grade fevers, productive cough, and hypoxia
despite treatment with PNA.  He was found to have a left
lingular mass on rigid bronch [**2119-3-24**] and was transferred to
the MICU for failed extubation s/p bronchoscopy. Unclear reasons
for failed extubation (?bleeding after procedure) however, the
patient was extubated within 48 hours of admission to the MICU.
He was found to have a new L lingular mass on bronchoscopy which
came back as squamous cell carcinoma with one out of two
positive lymph nodes. In the MICU, despite broad treatment for
PNA (R-sided), diuresis, and IV steroid treatment for possible
IPF flare for more than 5 days, he continued to have high O2
requirements with desaturations off face mask oxygen. After
family discussions and also with his outpatient pulmonologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], about larger goals of care, the decision was made
to focus on [**Last Name (STitle) **], be DNR/DNI, discontinue antibiotics, and
give morphine, ativan for [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient not a candidate for
oncologic treatment given his tenuous clinical status. He was
discharged to home hospice on high-flow oxygen for [**Last Name (STitle) **].
