Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 F with history of HTN, HL, CAD, depression, pulm HTN,
pulmonary fibrosis, h/o GIB presents with dizziness and possible
melena. Her hematocrit was noted to be decreased at 30 from her
baseline of 35.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 96.9 59 140/78 20 100% 6L. Found
to be orthostatic (supine: 112/57 HR 117, sitting: 104/58 HR
125), sitting up triggered her to feel dizzy. Labs in the ED
were notable for BUN of 38, WBC of 18.8 with 94.1% PMNs, HCT of
30.2 and Plts of 246. NG lavage returned coffee grounds, which
cleared after 500 cc of lavage. Guaiac was positive. She was
given a bolus of IV PPI and placed on a drip. GI evaluated the
patient in the ED and advised admission to the MICU. Vitals on
transfer were 98.6 99 135/82 20 100% on 6L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is comfortable and without
additional complaints. Of note the patient was recently started
on ciprofloxacin 2 days ago for urinary frequency and dysuria.

CXR [**2192-12-15**]
Coarse bilateral interstitial opacities are consistent with
patient's
known interstitial lung disease. There is minimally increased
prominence of pulmonary vasculature and heart size compared to
prior, possibly secondary to slightly lower lung volumes and/or
interval hydration/fluid overload. Mild congestive heart failure
cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Underlying interstitial lung disease slightly limits evaluation
for pneumonia, but no new large opacities are detected. Aortic
calcification is again seen. A nasogastric tube traverses below
the diaphragm, distal tip not well seen.

UGI [**2192-12-17**]
DOUBLE CONTRAST UPPER GI: Contrast passed freely from the
esophagus into a
large hiatal hernia and into the stomach. The esophagus was
normal in shape and contour. There are no ulcerations,
strictures, or webs. There were multiple tertiary contractions
noted. There was normal gastric mucosa seen in the large mixed
hiatal hernia. In the body, antrum, and pylorus, the gastric
mucosa appeared normal. There was no evidence of masses or
ulcerations. The study was somewhat limited due to patient's
inability to be repositioned. Contrast passed from stomach into
the duodenum. The duodenum was normal in course and caliber,
without any mucosal abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large hiatal hernia.
2. Mild esophageal dysmotility.
3. No evidence of large masses or ulcerations to explain the
patient's GI
bleed, although this was a somewhat limited study.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 F with history of HTN, HL, CAD, depression, pulm HTN,
pulmonary fibrosis, h/o GIB presents with dizziness and possible
melena.
.
#. GIB - likely upper GI bleed given coffee grounds seen on
lavage and reports of melena. Her BUN was high with normal
creatinine, which is also suggestive of UGIB. The patient was on
prednisone, meloxicam and aspirin which in combination
predisoses her to PUD and gastritis. The patients severe IPF and
pHTN makes EGD of particularly high risk of causing respiratory
failure. Further if intubated her pulmonary disease would make
her at high risk of not being extubatable. Therefore favored
conservative management without EGD. HCT was checked Q6H. She
was initially started on a PPI drip. She required 1 unit PRBC
for decrease in HT to 25. Repeat HCT was 29. Upper GI barium
swallow did not identify mass or ulcer responsible for her UGIB.
Her hematocrit remained stable and she was called out to the
general medical floor. While on the floor, her HCT was stable in
the mid 30s and she was deemed stable for discharge. She was
discharged on a [**Hospital1 **] dose of pantoprazole.

#. UTI - UA in ED without any persistent signs of UTI. Urine
culture was sent. She was continued on cipro to complete a 7 day
course. She was not sent home with any antibiotics.

#. Leukocytosis - WBC of 18.8, predominantly neutrophils. Not
febrile. UA without signs of persistent UTI. CXR without any
overt signs of pneumonia. Likely related to oral steroids and
stress reaction from GI bleed. No sign of pneumonia on CXR.

#. Pulmonary fibrosis - history of severe IPF,
