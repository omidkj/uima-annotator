HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female who had a colonoscopy and polypectomy three days prior

bright red blood per rectum.  She also developed right lower
quadrant pain which seemed to be getting worse.  She spiked a
fever up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit with worsening of pain and
distention, at which point she presented to the Emergency
Department.

25%).

12.  Hypothyroidism.
13.  Depression.
14.  History of lower gastrointestinal bleed in [**2106**], at which
time colonoscopy revealed diffuse polyposis with pan-colonic
bleeding from multiple polyps.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Albuterol.
 2.  Atrovent.
 3.  Verapamil.
 4.  Prednisone 3 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed a pleasant and cooperative female in mild distress.
Temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was
80, her blood pressure was 123/42.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed irregularly irregular.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.   The abdomen was
distended and tympanitic.  Very tender to palpation; worse in
the right lower quadrant with rebound.  Rectal examination
revealed decreased tone and occult-blood positive. During
examination by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 519**], the patient had a large frankly melenic
stool.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed her white blood cell count 16.8, her hematocrit was
26.5 (decreased from 36.9 four months prior), and her
platelets were 262.  Her INR was 1.1.  Sodium was 140,
potassium was 4.1, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 21,
blood urea nitrogen was 29, and her creatinine was 1.6.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was within normal
limits.

Electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle-branch block.  No
changes from prior electrocardiogram.

A computed tomography scan was interpreted to show acute
appendicitis.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to
the operating room on [**2111-9-19**] and underwent a subtotal
colectomy, ileoproctostomy, and splenectomy.  Please see the
Operative Note for details.  Due to the patient's guarded
status, she was kept in the Postanesthesia Care Unit and then
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day one, she was successfully extubated.
However, over the next two days she started spiking fevers up
to 102 degrees Fahrenheit and went into respiratory distress
with difficulty breathing and decreased PCO2 and had to be
reintubated.  Her sputum culture grew gram-negative rods.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin.
One day later she grew gram-negative rods in [**2-14**] bottles, at
which point vancomycin and Flagyl were added.  She was also
started on tube feeds for nutritional support.  The
Infectious Disease Service was consulted for continuous fever
spikes and antibiotics and agreed with management.

On postoperative day seven, the patient's ceftriaxone and
Flagyl were discontinued.  The patient remained intubated and
in respiratory distress.  The patient went into atrial
fibrillation.

The patient was again extubated on postoperative day eleven;
however, again she went into respiratory distress and was
emergently reintubated.  The patient's atrial fibrillation
was becoming more difficult to rate control with increasing
of Lopressor.  The patient had a couple of episodes of
bradycardia.  The Electrophysiology Service was consulted who
recommended switching the patient to amiodarone.  They also
started anticoagulation with heparin.  Digoxin was
discontinued.  The patient had an echocardiogram which showed
an ejection fraction of 45%.  The patient also started
growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus out of
her sputum cultures.  The patient's antibiotics were adjusted
to Zosyn and Flagyl.

On postoperative day seventeen, the patient's liver function
tests were noted to increase.  On postoperative day eighteen,
the patient underwent a computed tomography scan which showed
a distended gallbladder and dilated common bile duct.  Unable
to wean off of ventilator.

The Gastrointestinal Service was consulted, and the patient
underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
on [**2111-9-30**] which showed a stone in the middle of the
common bile duct.  A stent was placed.  A sphincterotomy was
not performed due to the patient's coagulation status.

Due to the patient's prolonged/extended distended
gallbladder, a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed.
The patient had a few more episodes of poorly controlled
atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone.  A chest
x-ray showed increased pleural effusion, and an
ultrasound-guided thoracentesis was performed which drained
100 cc of yellow fluid.

The patient continued to have respiratory distress with large
amounts of thick secretions with suctioning of the lungs
almost around the clock.  Otherwise, she remained stable and
afebrile.

A long discussion was held with the family who wished to
extubate the patient and change her status to do not
resuscitate/do not intubate which was done on [**2111-10-19**].  The patient remained stable, however, guarded.  She
continued to have ectopy.  Her status was changed to comfort
measures only on [**10-21**].  The patient continued to have
ectopy which was increasing in frequency and severity.  The
patient's respiratory status was also slowly decreasing until
she finally desaturated and ceased to have a blood pressure
and heart rate and was pronounced dead.

 1.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed.
 2.  Status post colectomy.
