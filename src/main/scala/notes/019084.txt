Images:
CXR:
AP portable upright view of the chest is obtained. Evaluation is

quite limited given the underpenetrated technique. Areas of
scarring are again noted with upper lobe lucency and splaying of
bronchovasculature most compatible with underlying emphysema.
There is no definite sign of superimposed pneumonia though
technique limits evaluation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
appears grossly within normal limits. Bones appear grossly
intact.
IMPRESSION: Limited study with no definite sign of pneumonia.
Emphysema again noted.
.
CTA:
1. No PE seen to the subsegmental levels.
2. Small right pleural effusion. Mild bibasilar atalectasis.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with nodes measuring up to 17 mm
in diameter.
4. 8 mm RUL nodule. 3 month followup CT recommended to assess
for stability,especially in the presence of mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. No focal onsolidations detected.
5. Mild septal thickening, most prominent at the left base, most
compatible ith mild interstitial edema.
.
Liver U/S:
No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. No son[**Name (NI) 493**]
[**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign. Trace free fluid adjacent to the gallbladder.
The CBD is not dilated (4mm)
.
EKG:  NSR @ 89, TWI V3-V6.

TTE: findings consistent with severe cor pulmonale, RA pressure
10-20 mmhg, RV dilation, depressed RV free wall contractility,
significant pulmonic regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure: Patient was continued on levoquin and
multiple doses of lasix, nebs and prednisone for presumed COPD
exacerbation.  Patient continued to sat in high 80s, low 90s on
face mask.  TTE concerning for severe pulmonary hypertension.
Patient underwent right heart catheterization to evaluate for
intracardiac shunt and to evaluate pulmonary pressures.  He was
intubated without incident for the procedure for concern that he
would desat while lying prone.  During the cath the patient
dropped his blood pressure and required levophed, vasopressin
and dopamine as well as fluids for support.  Please see cath
report for full details.  Upon return to the SICU the patient
was bradycardic and went into PEA arrest.  He was coded for
about 15 minutes and given multiple doses of epinephrine and
bicarb with normal fingerstick glucose.  The code was called at
1841.

# Elevated LFTs: liver ultrasound unrevealing, hepatitis
serologies negative.

# Alcohol use: concern for withdrawal
- CIWA (Diazepam q6)

# Depression: Not suicidal, home zoloft continued.
