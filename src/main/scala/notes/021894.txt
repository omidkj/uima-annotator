FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-18**], there is no
convincing
evidence of pneumothorax at this time. Right central catheter
remains in
place. Persistent opacification at the left base is again
consistent with
atelectasis and effusion.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Prominent
Eustachian valve (normal variant).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. See
Conclusions for post-bypass data
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no prolapse or flail leaflets. Even with T
[**Doctor Last Name **], MR remains mild. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Post-bypass:
Intact thoracic aorta.
Mild MR.
LVEF 45-50%
Preserved Right ventricular systolic function. LV similar
toprebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 107121**] was a same day admit to the operating room for
coronary bypass grafting. Please see operative report for
details in summary he had coronary bypass graftinf x4 with:1.
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
and saphenous vein grafts to diagonal obtuse ramus artery and
the right coronary artery.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein. His bypass
time was 155 minutes with a crossclamp time of 95 minutes. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
In the immediate post operative period he remained
hemodynamically stable, woke neurologically intact and was
extubated. On POD1 he was transferred from the ICU to the
stepdown floor for continued care and physical recovery. All
tubes lines and drains were removed according to cardiac surgery
protocol. The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful,
his activity level advanced and on POD4 he was discharged home
with visiting nurses. Followup with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7772**] in 4 weeks.
