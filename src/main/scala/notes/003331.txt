status.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient's
vital signs were 82, 88, 80/50, 18, 95% in room air.
General:  Mildly distracted middle-aged woman with poor focus
but answered questions appropriately.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular
movements intact, oropharynx stained with charcoal, dry
mucous membranes, no neck stiffness.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally except for a few rhonchi.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds, guaiac negative in Emergency Room.  Extremities:  No
edema, 2+ pedal pulses.  Neurologic examination:  Alert and
oriented times three, oriented to hospital and year,
appropriate only slowly.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 6.2, hematocrit
35.1, BUN 69, creatinine 2.1 and creatinine clearance 32.3.
Urinalysis:  Negative.  Toxicology screen:  Positive for
benzodiazepines and opiates.  Chest x-ray:  Negative.
Cerebrospinal fluid:  No white blood cells, no red blood
cells, Gram stain with 1+ polycytes, protein 22, glucose 71.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Neurologic:  The patient was admitted
with a change in mental status.  The patient was sedated and
there was concern over ingestion.  Toxicology screen did not
reveal any ingestion, however, she does take benzodiazepines
and opiates on a regular basis.

Psychiatry was consulted, who did not feel that the patient
had suicidal ideation or had a suicide attempt.
Neuropsychiatric consultation demonstrated diffuse deficits
with lack of attention.  An electroencephalogram was
performed, which demonstrated diffuse slowing consistent with
mild encephalopathy.

The patient's mental status improved slightly over the next
few days and she became less lethargic.  She continued to
deny any ingestion.  After consultation with infectious
disease, psychiatry, neuropsychiatry and the medical team,
the patient was felt safe for discharge and near her
baseline.  The patient is to follow up immediately after
discharge with the psychiatric social worker at the methadone
clinic..

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was initially brought to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and given a total of nine liters
of normal saline.  The patient's blood pressure responded
adequately and normalized.  She was transferred to the floor
on hospital day number one and her blood pressure remained
stable throughout her hospital course.  It is unclear why her
blood pressure dropped initially.  This may have been
secondary to ingestion or volume depletion.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's oxygen saturation remained
normal in room air.  She completed her azithromycin course
from her last hospitalization for community acquired
pneumonia.  She continued to have a mild cough but was
afebrile on discharge.

4.  Renal:  The patient was admitted with a creatinine of
2.1.  Following the fluid challenge, her creatinine improved
to her baseline.  This likely due to a pre-renal state from
volume depletion.

5.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit was slightly lower
than her baseline.  However, the patient was guaiac negative
and did not demonstrate signs of bleeding.  The patient was
menstruating and this was felt to contribute to her anemia.
Her hematocrit remained stable and she was safe for
discharge.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged with direct
follow-up with the psychiatric social worker at the [**Hospital 2514**]
Clinic.  She was then discharged to home.  Of note,
occupational therapy was also consulted, who felt that the
patient was safe to live at home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypotension, likely secondary to volume depletion.
2.  Change in mental status, may be secondary to volume
depletion or toxic ingestion.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Acute renal failure, secondary to volume depletion.
5.  Community acquired pneumonia.
6.  Methadone maintenance for heroin addiction.
7.  HIV.
