STUDIES:
[**2136-10-23**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Increased precordial voltage. Consider left ventricular
hypertrophy. Since the previous tracing of [**2136-9-26**] the rate is
faster and atrial premature beats are new. Precordial ST-T wave
abnormalities are less prominent. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

[**2136-10-23**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.

[**2136-10-23**] Renal Ultrasound
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. 2.6 cm hypodense right lower pole renal lesion likely
representing a
complex cyst. An MRI of the kidney is recommended for further
characterization
of this lesion.
3. Status post left nephrectomy.

[**2136-10-25**] Portable CXR - severe pulmonary edema

[**2136-10-26**] Echo - EF > 75%; Mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Hyperdynamic global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Tachycardia. Mild aortic dilation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

[**2136-10-26**] CXR interval worsening in left lower lobe opacity. This

could be due to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be totally
excluded. Right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.
Interstitial edema has improved. Small left pleural effusion is
stable. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, with cardiac
size top normal.

[**2136-10-23**] EGD Findings Esophagus:  Mucosa: Grade 4 esophagitis
and ulceration with stigmata of recent bleeding was seen in the
gastroesophageal junction, compatible with esophagitis.
Stomach:
Contents: Coffee ground heme was seen in the stomach body.
Mucosa: Localized erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was
noted in the antrum. These findings are compatible with
gastritis.  Duodenum:  Contents: Clotted blood was seen in the
second part of the duodenum.  Mucosa: Localized erythema of the
mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the duodenal bulb
compatible with duodenitis.  Other findings: The source of
bleeding is most likely the esophagitis and ulceration.
Impression: Grade 4 esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction
compatible with esophagitis. Erythema in the antrum compatible
with gastritis. Blood in the stomach body. Erythema in the
duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. Blood in the second
part of the duodenum. The source of bleeding is most likely the
esophagitis and ulceration.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo male with a history of alcohol abuse presented with
hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, anuria x4 days, and acute renal
failure.  Each of the problems addressed during this
hospitalization are described in detail below:

1. Hypotension
On presentation, the patient was tranienently hypotensive likely
secondary to hematemesis and hypovolemia. ABG consistent with
contraction alkalosis.  The patient has remained hemodynamically
stable and not needed pressors.  Aggressive rehydration with IV
fluid was started to maintain MAP>65.  Hypotension resolved
shortly thereafter.

2. Acute renal failure
On admission, the patient was found to be in ARF with Cr 15.5,
baseline 1.0.  Anion gap was 25, likely secondary to uremia.
Electrolytes were within normal limits. The patient was not
fluid overloaded. Contraction alakalosis likely secondary to
vomiting. Foley was placed in ED. CK was found to be 7399.
Etiology of ARF was not clear, but possibilities may include (1)
nephrolithiasis given single kidney in this patient with a
recently passed kidney stone, (2) pre-renal cause given
intoxication and hypovolemia (3) rhabdomyolysis. On
presentation, aggressive diuresis with IV fluids was initiated.
Per renal recs, SPEP, UPEP, C3, C4 were checked and were wnl.
Given a finding of a renal cyst on renal U/S, there was concern
of obstruction.  Urology was consulted and the patient underwent
cystopscopy and retrograde pyelogram, which revealed no
obsruction.  Over the next two days, Creatinine and CK trended
down.  The patient responded to IVF with a large UOP. He never
required dialysis.  Prior to discharge, Cr = 1.3 and stable at
this level.

3. Hematemesis
This was believed to be secondary to severe esophagitis and
resolved on presentation.  GI was consulted and performed
emergent EGD. EGD demonstrated severe esophagitis.  His
hematocrit was 40 on presentation but then declined to 33. He
received 2 units of packed RBCs with improvement in his
hematocrit to 38-40.  PPI IV bid and Carafate slurry were given.
The patient was maintained NPO initially and diet was slowly
advanced. The patient has not had any further episodes of
hemaemesis during this admission.  He is discharged on PPI and
sulcrafate.

4. Alcohol abuse
The patient was maintained on CIWA scale to watch for signs of
alcohol withdrawal, but did not actively withdraw.  Toxicology
screen was only positive for opia
