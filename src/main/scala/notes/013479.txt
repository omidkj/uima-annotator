Brief Hospital Course:
/[**6-5**] CXR: right mainstem intubation, cordis in place.

[**2142-6-2**] EGG: afib 104 bpm, LAD, LBBB (old), no STE (sgarbossa).


# hypotension - Was worked up for hypovolemic shock with blood
transfusions and serial hcts. no acute GIB found. Underwent TTE
which showed worsened CHF. Hypotension did require pressors
however as patient's family eventually changed goals of care to
comfort measures this was weaned off. she passed away after a
few days in the hospital.

# respiratory failure - pt intubated in the setting of prolonged
hypotension, resulting on altered mental status, and concern
over patient's airway.  pre-intubation ABG 7.35/46/340,
consistent with good lung mechanics. She was quickly extubated
and tolerated this well, although was clearly uncomfortable.
After the family changed the goals of care she was kept
comfortable with morphine PRN and passed away a few weeks later.


# Code: Patient came in and family discussion resulted in
changing from DNR to CMO if patient was extubated. she was
eventually extubated and tolerated it well for a few days. She
was transitioned to CMO.
