Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter; referral from [**Location (un) 3844**]
for cath and ablation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ablation of atrial flutter
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
75F w/ PMH htn, high chol, afib, aflutter, CAD ongoing SOB,
fatigue, and DOE since CABG [**10-26**]. She reports that she has had
worsening fatigue and SOB over the past 3 weeks, including a
recently positive stress test. Plan from discussions with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11250**] ([**Location (un) 3844**] cardiologist) is to
admit patient for heparin, check TEE on day of admission, cath
on HD2 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] followed by ablation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59545**]. The cath
did not occur because of the events during the ablation
procedure. She was emergently transfered to the CCU after she
became hypotensive during an ablation procedure.  Initially,
during the procedure, she became hypotensive to the 60s systolic
with bradycardic to the 30s.  A temporary pacer was placed and
dopamine was started.  An echocardiogram was negative for
perforation.  A permanent pacemaker was subsequently placed
(DDD).  Later in the procedure, she complained of back pain and
continued to have transient hypotension.  She was intermittently
on dopamine.  Post-procedure, she developed abdominal pain in
addition to back pain.  An abdominal CT revealed a large left
sided pelvic hematome (8 cm in diameter) that was shifting the
bladder and the sigmoid colon.  Given her persistent
hypotension, she was maintained on dopamine and given 1500 cc of
fluids.  Her elevated INR to 1.7 was reversed with 2 units of
fresh frozen plasma.  She also received a total of 3 units of
packed red cells.  After the 3 units of red cells, her
hematocrit remained stable at 30 for 24 hours.  She was given a
4th unit of red cells to keep her hematocrit above 30.  Her
dopamine was weaned within 24 hours of her bleed.

Pertinent Results:
[**2109-1-22**] carotid u/s: 25% stenosis at both bifurcations and prox
int carotid arteries.
.
[**2109-11-7**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus seen in
the body of the L atrium/appendage or the body of the R
atrium/appendage. No ASD, PFO noted. LVEF>55%. Diffuse plaque
noted in the aortic arch and descending aorta. Complex atheroma
noted in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. No AS,
trace AI, mild MR.
.
[**2109-10-29**]: cath at CMC: 100% LAD, 90% of small OMB, 50-60% pRCA,
LVEF 45-50%.
.

[**2111-3-10**]: Persantine stress: Decreased uptake in the

[**2111-4-6**] TEE@[**Hospital1 18**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile)
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior TEE study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2109-11-7**], the maximum detected LAA
emptying velocity has increased. The severity of the mitral
regurgitationhas slightly increased.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus.
.
Echo [**4-7**] post procedure: The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CXR [**4-6**]: 1. Stable post-operative appearance of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette. 2. Emphysema. 3. Mild
post-operative changes with no evidence of acute interstitial
process.
CXR post pacer [**4-7**]: There has been interval placement of a
left-
sided dual-chamber pacemaker with leads projecting over
appropriate locations. A right-sided internal jugular vein
central venous catheter is seen with the tip at the mid SVC. No
pneumothorax is seen. There is stable atelectasis in the left
mid lung and left base. The right lung is clear.
CXR [**4-8**]: No change.
.
Bilateral groin U/S [**4-7**]: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or
arteriovenous fistula. No groin hematoma. Inferior margin of
pelvic hematoma seen on CT today is partially imaged.
.
CT abd/pel [**4-7**] (post ablation)
1. Large acute extraperitoneal hematoma in the left pelvis. This
finding was discussed and reviewed with the Cardiology Service
while the patient was still on the scanner. Vascular Surgery was
immediately paged.
2. Distended gallbladder. Stone and sludge are noted in the
gallbladder body.
3. High-attenuation liver suggestive of amiodarone use. Low
attenuation hepatic foci are not fully characterized on this
exam.
.
[**4-9**] B LENI and L UE U/S: neg for DVT
.
Chest CT w/o contrast (amio toxicity eval; d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
1. No definite evidence to support pulmonary amiodarone
toxicity.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Hyperdense liver consistent with patient's known history of
amiodarone toxicity. A few scattered hypodense lesions within
the liver are not adequately characterized on this non-contrast
study. Ultrasound or MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
4. Distended gallbladder. Moderate amount of intraluminal
sludge.
5. Pleural-based calcification in right anterior lung consistent
with prior  asbestos exposure.
6. Cardiomegaly and atherosclerosis.
.
[**2111-4-15**] Cath:
  1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system with
three vessel disease. The LMCA was angiographically without
disease. The
LAD was proximally occluded and filled via the LIMA graft. There
was a
60% stenosis of the LAD proximal to the touch down of the graft.
The D1
was occluded. The LCX was diffusely diseased. The OM1 was a
modest
branching vessel with 99% stenosis and
