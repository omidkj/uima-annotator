Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2193-7-24**]


History of Present Illness:
81F Argentinian with hx PMR, OA, HTN/HL now presenting with 6
weeks of worsening substernal CP radiating to the jaw with
shortness of breath. It was at its worst last night, when it
awoke her from sleep at 3am. It starts in the chest and travels
to both sides of the jaw. No N/V or diaphoresis. + palpitations.
She also has some bilateral subjective arm and leg weakness. Her
daughter notes that her symptoms have worsened over the past 6
weeks, from only with mild exercise (walking at home) to while
at rest. Patient thought it was indigestion so did not contact
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 46451**]. Stress testing from [**2190**] was negative, but symptoms
were completely different. Only symptoms that is the same is
fatigue. Pt spoke with PCP's triage nurse today and was sent to
ED for eval.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.8 73 193/68 18 100% RA. On exam, pt
noted to be regularly irregular with normal heart sounds, clear
lungs, and benign abdomen. EKG showed low limb voltages, NSR at
60, NA/NI, no signs of ischemia. Bedside echo was negative for
pericardial effusion. Patient's troponin trended from 0.02 -->
0.11. She was guaiac (negative) and started on heparin gtt for
NSTEMI. She also received plavix 300 mg. For blood pressure
control she received labetalol 5mg IV. She was then started on a
nitro gtt for bp control, but this was discontinued in favor of
nitro paste as no [**Wardname 13764**] or [**Wardname 5010**] beds were available. VS on
transfer were: 98.2- 65-18-96 ra 132/80.
.
Currently, patient is comfortable and denies CP, SOB. She
reports she only took one of her blood pressure medications. She
feels that her legs are weak when she wants to use them.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria,
hematuria. Can not comment on stool color or blood as she is
legally blind.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2193-7-27**]**

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2193-7-27**]):    No MRSA isolated.

Imaging:
CXR [**2193-7-23**]: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared
to previous exam from [**2193-3-11**]. The lungs are clear of
focal consolidation or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged noting
significant degenerative changes at the right glenohumeral and
acromioclavicular joints.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

TTE [**2193-7-24**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2193-7-25**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant systeme

demonstrated two-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
without
angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis. The LAD had a
90%
proximal stenosis. The LCx had minimal luminal irregularities.
The RCA
was totally occluded proximally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
hypertension.
3. PCI of the LAD complicated by balloon rupture and vessel
dissection
successfully rescued with four BMS (distal to proximal: 2.0x8mm,

2.0x8mm, 2.0x12mm, 2.0x12mm; see PTCA comments).
4. Successful left femoral arteriotomy closure with 6F ExoSeal
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic arterial hypertension.
3. PCI of the LAD complicated by vessel dissection successfully
rescued
with four BMS.
4. Continue plavix and aspirin

TTE [**2193-7-26**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I
(mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represent
