History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 yo M w/PMHx sx for diastolic CHF, s/p MVR,
CAD, HTN, DM2 who presents with one month of gradually worsening
fatigue and dyspnea, with weight gain of approximately 10 lbs at
home. Per daughter, patient has been gradually becoming more
fatigued. He has developed increased lower extremity swelling.
He has stable 2 pillow orthopnea. He has been compliant with his
medications, including his torsemide, and has not been eating
salty foods, and has in fact been taking very little po in the
past several days. His oxygen requirement has increased from 2L
NC at night only to 80% of the time requiring supplemental
oxygen. He has had a labile INR as well, yesterday measured at
6.3, and had epistaxis, ecchymoses and occasional hematuria. His
daughter denies [**Name2 (NI) **], coffee grounds emesis, or BRBPR. He has
never had a colonoscopy/endoscopy. She denies chest pain,
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, head trauma, falls, increased
confusion, cough, dysuria. Patient has been living at home with
his wife, who helps with his medications.
.
In the ED patient received 5 mg vitamin K and 2u FFP to reverse
his coagulopathy. He was noted to be guaiac positive as well. He
was started on a lasix gtt for volume overload.

CXR: 1. Stable massive cardiomegaly.
2. Mild improvement in the pulmonary vascular congestion
although not totally resolved.
3. Loculated chronic right-sided pleural effusion.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
35-40 %) with inferior/infero-septal, and inferoapical
hypokinesis/akinesis. The remaining segments appear hypokinetic.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Torn mitral
chordae are present. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-4-3**], the
overall LVEF is slightly lower (overerstimated on the prior
study). The degreee of pulmonary hypertension detected has
increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 yo M w/PMHx sx for severe diastolic
CHF, CAD, DM2, CVA who presents with a GIB with associated SOB
and fatigue, also with evidence of NSTEMI with elevation in
cardiac enzymes likely in setting of demand.
.
#. Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: The patient was
started on a Lasix drip in the emergency department for both
evidence of volume overload on exam (crackles and
sacral/peripheral edema) and pulmonary edema on CXR. He also had
a Ck and troponin elevation consistent with either NSTEMI or
more likely demand ischemia secondary to volume overload and
heart failure. An echocardiogram showed multiple wall motion
abnormalities and overall depressed EF at 35-40% with moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension. He was transferred out of the ICU
and transferred to the cardiology service. His Lasix drip was
continued and uptitrated to 20mg/hour in order to attain approx
1L negative daily. He did have improvement of edema and oxygen
saturation, and appeared more comfortable with diuresis, though
it was difficult to ascertain improvement in dyspnea as pt was
often sleepy or confused. His diuresis was limited by rising
creatinine and uremia and his Lasix drip was discontinued. His
carvedilol dose was decreased to 12.5mg po bid to allow more
room in blood pressure for diuresis. He was continued on
aspirin, atorvastatin, isosrbide mononitrate and ezetimibe. Due
to continued elevated creatinine/BUN, his home torsemide dose
was not restarted on discharge, to be restarted based on labs
[**2-20**] and clinical status, may be restarted. Pt was also provided
with a prescription for concentrated morphine in the event of
shortness of breath not relieved with Lasix.
.
#. Acute blood loss anemia: Upon admission patient had
self-limited [**Month/Year (2) **] thought secondary to a supratherapeutic INR.
NG lavage was not done secondary to concern for elevated INR for
which he received FFP. The patient had no further episodes of GI
bleeding and hematocrit remained stable throughout his hospital
course. He was started on a heparin drip once hematocrit
stablized with bridge to Coumadin for mechanical mitral valve.
His INR was held for several days after supratherapeutic value
of 7 and given 1.25mg po vitamin K and 2 units of FFP with
decline to 2.4. His coumadin was then resumed at a lower dose of
2.5mg po daily, to be checked on [**2-20**].
.
#. Hyponatremia. Upon admission, patient's sodium was 116 and
did partially correct with above medical managment and diuresis
to 136 without the need for other intervention.
.
#. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient was continued on
calcitriol and started on sevelemer for increased phosporus. His
BUN remained elevated throughout admission, likely high enough
to be causing symptoms of confusion from uremia, but after
discussion with the family it was decided to direct care more
towards comfort, and in particular, relief of dyspnea so
diuresis was pursued in spite of this. Creatinine increased to
3.9 and Lasix drip was discontinued. His home dose of torsemide
should be restarted as above.
.
#. Goals of care: As previously mentioned, the patient's family
and health care proxy had already decided against dialysis and
DNR/DNI order. They also asked to speak with the palliative care
team regarding hospice options but ultimately it was decided not
to pursue comfort care at this time, though this might occur on
the next hospitalization if he does not respond to diuresis.
