Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Neurogenic claudication

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L4/L5 decompressive laminectomies with instrumented fusion


History of Present Illness:
In brief, patient is a 70 yo M w PMH of CAD(CABG ((LIMA-obtuse
marginal branch, SVG-LAD and known occluded SVG-RCA)in [**2170**], PCI
in [**2181**]), PVD, unprovoked PE, negative LENIs in [**2183-4-4**], who
was admitted to the ortho spine service for laminectomy. He had
successful L4-L5 laminectomy on [**2184-1-20**]. On [**2183-1-22**] he
developed chest/shoulder pain, tachycardia, EKG changes and
troponin elevation consistent with [**Date Range 7792**].  His EKG showed STD
in I, II, aVL, AVF, V2-V5 as well as STE in AVR. His troponin
was elevated at 0.12, Ck MB 11. He was also tachycardic to the
120s. His EKG changes improved with better rate control. He also
had fevers on [**2184-1-21**] and [**2184-1-22**]. Given concern for possible
recurrent PE, STAT echo was done at bedside this morning and did
not show right ventricular dysfunction or strain. Chest x-ray
showed multifocal pneumonia, so he was started on antibiotics
for HCAP coverage.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on
[**2183-1-22**] which showed occlusion of the severely diseased LMCA
that supplied a diffusely diseased OM1 that measured previously
0.5 mm and a small (0.75 mm) diagonal system.
.
At 03:30 am on [**2183-1-23**] he flipped into atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response (heart rate 130s to 140s), with rate
related ST-depressions.  Patient reported some palpitations, but
no new chest pain.  He also desaturated to the high 80s and
oxygen requirement increased.  He was transitioned from 4L NC to
face tent with 35% Oxygen.  He was administered 5mg IV
metoprolol with improvement of heart rate to the 110s, but also
a drop in SBP to the 80s.  SBP trended back up to the low 100s
in about 15 minutes.  He was given 500cc NS over 60 minutes and
transferred to the CCU for further management of Afib with RVR.
He previously had one episode of atrial fibrillation following
his CABG.
.
On arrival in the CCU he denies any chest pain, palpitations
subjective dyspnea except for an inability to take deep breaths,
no cough.  He was AAOx3 and mentating well.  Rate control was
attempted with diltiazem 5 mg IV.  His HR went down to 100-110s,
and BP was down to 80s/60s, with MAPs in low 60s.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2184-1-22**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- and distal septal
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA:  Ostially occluded
LAD:  Occluded mid vessel.  Heavily calcified.  Fills via SVG

the LIMA and has minimal disease.  The rPL and rPDA system fill
via collaterals from the AV groove Cx.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.Secondary prevention CAD
2.Infarction appears to be occlusion of the severely diseased
LMCA that supplied a diffusely diseased OM1 that measured
previously 0.5 mm and a small (0.75 mm) diagonal system.
3.Medical management for [**Last Name (un) 7792**].
4.No need to continue heparin and would not manage with
clopidogrel given recent spine surgery.

ETT: [**2184-1-7**]
INTERPRETATION: 69 yo man s/p CABG in [**2154**] and stent to LAD in
[**2170**]
was referred to evaluate an atypical chest discomfort. The
patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4
minutes. No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported.
No significant ST segment changes were noted. The rhythm was
sinus with rare isolated APDs and VPDs noted. The hemodynamic
response to the Persantine infusion was appropriate.
Post-infusion, the patient was administered 125 mg Aminophylline
IV.
.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
Nuclear report sent separately.
.
CARDIAC CATH: [**2181**]
1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the SVG-LAD anastomosis
stenosis and distal 50% stenosis with a 2.25x20mm Taxus Atom
stent that was
postdilated to 2.5mm in the mid and proximal portion. Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
2. Successful deployment of angioseal vascular closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Patent SVG-LAD stents.
2. Successful PCI to SVG-LAD.
3. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.

CXR [**2184-1-22**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
evidence of a
newly appeared parenchymal opacity at both the right lung base
and in the left lung, notably in the perihilar areas in the
retrocardiac space. The
distribution suggests pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema,
notably given the absence of pleural effusions and the absence
of other findings indicative of fluid overload. Borderline size
of the cardiac silhouette. Status post CABG. No hilar or
mediastinal changes.
.
CTA chest [**2184-1-23**]
FINDINGS: Sternal wires and post CABG changes are present. Mild
calcification of the coronary arteries is stable. The heart is
normal in shape and size.  The right ventricle is not enlarged.
The interentricular septum is normal is shape and contour. There
is no pericardial effusion. The aorta unremarkable without
aneurysm or dissection. The pulmonary arteries ar
