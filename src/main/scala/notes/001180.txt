History of Present Illness:
59yo delivery man with unknown PMH ([**Last Name (un) 15025**] answering at home
number), was found down in basement after owner of house heard
"thump".  911 called, with police arriving within 3 minutes per
report, and pt. found to be pulseless and CPR initiated.  EMS
arrived within a few minutes (13:52) and pt. found to be in Vfib
arrest, shocked X 1 into eventual VT, after which he received
atropine and epi X 2 with return of perfusing atrial
fibrillation.  GCS of 3 initially.  Per EMS notes first measured
BP at 14:05.  Pt. was intubated in the field and brought to to
[**Location (un) **] ED, where he had EKG initially in afib with TWI and <1mm
depressions in inferior and lateral leads.  Initial vitals
showed temp 97, HR 128, BP 152/84, RR 16, 100% intubated.  He
was given asa 325, lopressor, and started on heparin gtt, and
given 2.1 L NS.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization and
further management.
.
Per ED note, pt. initiated on plavix 600mg and aggrastat by
[**Location (un) **] and started on cooling protocol.  In ED, initial
vitals HR 95, BP 154/79.  EKG notable for sinus rhythm and
similar TWI and depressions as at [**Location (un) **]. Head CT and C-spine
negative, CXR with pulmonary edema.  Given vecuronium X 1 and
continued cooling and transferrred to ICU.
.
Unable to obtain review of symptoms, as pt. intubated.

LABORATORY DATA: no labs provided from OSH.  CK 152 with MB 6.3,
trop 0.07, Cr 1.3, AST 97 ALT74

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Low-lying endotracheal tube. Recommend withdrawing 3 cm for
optimal positioning.
2. Moderate pulmonary edema.
.
CT C-spine:
FINDINGS: The patient is intubated and a nasogastric tube is
present within the esophagus limiting evaluation of the
prevertebral soft tissues. No acute fracture or malalignment is
detected. Normal spinal alignment is preserved.
The lateral masses of C1 are well apposed on C2. The dens is
intact. The thyroid gland is normal in appearance.
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment.
.
CT Head:
FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally
midline
structures, hydrocephalus or evidence of major territorial
infarct is
apparent. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
