Intensive Care Unit resident), vitals:  Temperature 105
degrees, blood pressure 55 to 148 systolic/18 to 110
diastolic, heart rate 110, oxygen saturation 98%.  General:
Man who appears older than stated age, able to answer
questions, alert and oriented x 3.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Extraocular movements intact, pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation, mouth clear,
poor dentition, sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival petechiae.
Neck:  Supple.  Cardiac:  Heart sounds regular rhythm, with
no S3 or S4, II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating to the
axilla.  Lungs:  Bilateral rales at the bases.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Numerous amputations of digits.  Right hand with necrotic
fingertips.  Several full and partial finger amputations
bilaterally.  Right leg with erythema and tenderness to
distal one-third, especially over the heel.  Left foot with
TMA.

LABORATORY DATA:   On presentation, CBC revealed a white
count of 7.4, hematocrit 36.9, platelets 265.  Coag studies
revealed an INR of 1.3, PT 13.7, PTT 33.1.  Chem 7 revealed a
sodium of 141, potassium 4.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate 16,
BUN 7.4, creatinine 3.8, glucose 131.  Urinalysis revealed
[**5-5**] white blood cells and bacteria.  Albumin was 3.6,
calcium 10.0, magnesium 1.7.  Arterial blood gas revealed a
pH of 7.57, PCO2 20, PO2 192, lactate 6.3.  Electrocardiogram
obtained upon admission revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of
143 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, left axis
deviation, Q waves in Leads II, III, AVF, question marked ST
elevations at Leads I, AVL, poor R wave progression.
Subsequent electrocardiogram (also obtained on [**2132-3-29**])
revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute, some
resolution of ST elevations at lower heart rate.  Chest x-ray
obtained upon admission revealed the pulmonary vasculature to
be normal.  There was no evidence of overt cardiac failure or
pneumonia.  There were no effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient, as noted above, was initially
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The first two
weeks of the patient's approximately [**Hospital 17840**] hospital
stay were spent in the Intensive Care Unit.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
on pressor support and started on ceftriaxone for presumed
sepsis.  The ensuing workup of the patient's fever included
blood cultures that would later grow out
methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, as would tissue
samples from the patient's right lower extremity.
Cerebrospinal fluid and joint fluid from the patient's right
knee did not yield any cultured organisms.  The Vascular
Surgery and Infectious Disease services were consulted and
followed the patient throughout the remainder of his hospital
course.  The patient's antibiotic regimen underwent several
iterations following admission.

The [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable
for the following events:
[**3-29**]:  The patient ruled in for a myocardial
infarction, with a maximum CK of 1284, and a maximum troponin
of greater than 50.  He was intubated for respiratory
failure.  The patient's creatinine also reached its zenith at
3.3.  The patient underwent right lower extremity biopsy of
his fascia, which was ultimately deemed to be necrotizing
fascitis per pathology report.

[**2132-4-2**]:  The patient went into diabetic ketoacidosis.
He was also taken to the operating room for emergent
debridement and exploration of his right lower extremity.
Per report from the Vascular Surgery service, there was no
significant evidence of necrotizing fascitis in the operating
room.

[**2132-4-9**]:  The patient developed perioral HSV-like
lesions.  These were later confirmed to be herpes simplex
virus Type I by monoclonal fluorescent antibody tests.
Consequently, the patient was started on acyclovir, in
addition to his other antibacterial medications.

[**2132-4-10**]:  The patient was extubated.  He was transfused
two units of packed red blood cells.

Following extubation, the patient continued to have
occasional fevers, with vancomycin being restarted and
discontinued on several occasions.  Ultimately, the patient's
antibiotic regimen upon discharge from the Medical Intensive
Care Unit consisted of oxacillin, levofloxacin, and
acyclovir.  The patient's renal function improved following
admission, with a creatinine of 1.1 noted on [**2132-4-13**].
Following extubation, the patient exhibited good oxygen
saturation on room air.  The patient's diet was advanced, and
he tolerated this well.  The patient was called out to the
Medicine floor  on [**2132-4-13**].

Following transfer to the Medicine [**Hospital1 **] floor, plain films
and CT scans of the patient's right lower extremity were
obtained. These revealed evidence of osteomyelitis in the
third metatarsal.  Because of the patient's poor vascular
status, the Surgery service opted not to pursue any surgical
intervention at that time.  Lower extremity arterial Doppler
examination on [**2132-4-17**], revealed significant and
widespread vascular disease, especially at the superficial
femoral artery and popliteals bilaterally.

As no operative intervention could be pursued, the patient
was maintained on intravenous oxacillin, per the
recommendations of the Infectious Disease service.  They
further recommended that the patient remain on intravenous
oxacillin for four weeks following discharge from [**Hospital1 346**] (the patient has already been on the
intravenous oxacillin for two weeks during his
hospitalization, so he will ultimately receive a six week
course of the antibiotic).

The patient's right lower extremity pain was controlled with
a morphine patient-controlled analgesia for a time.  This was
ultimately changed to oral Oxycontin, with MSIR being used on
an as needed basis for breakthrough pain.

Diabetes mellitus Type 1 issues:  The patient's finger stick
blood sugars were checked four times a day.  He is being
maintained on a regimen of Lantus insulin, with a regular
insulin sliding scale four times a day.
