Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure, hepatitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Intubation
Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Patient intubated & unable to answer questions. History obtained
from medical chart and patient's mother, [**Name (NI) 1258**] [**Name (NI) 5261**].

Ms. [**Known lastname 30949**] is a 41 y/o F with PMH of hepatitis C and IVDU who
presented to OSH with several days of abdominal pain, N/V, and
jaundice. She described the pain as constant and diffuse. She
reported subjective fevers with cough. Denied urinary symptoms
or change in stool color. Per the patient's mother, Ms.
[**Known lastname 30949**] was seen by her stepfather four days ago and he
noticed that she "looked ill and yellow." Reportedly took 4
tylenol tables (unknown strength yesterday morning). At the OSH,
she received 3 mg IV dilaudid, 12.5 mg phenergan, and 1 L NS.
Blood pressure reported at 106/59 at OSH with tachycardia to
101. Reported CXR no infiltrates (?). Blood cultures were sent
and she was found to have transaminases AST > [**Numeric Identifier 3301**], ALT > 8000
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of liver failure. Of
note, in OSH ED, patient reported prolonged sobriety but recent
use of opiates and alcohol but stopping 4 days prior to
presentation; reported not being able to keep down POs since
that time.

Initial vitals in [**Hospital1 18**] ED: T 96.8, HR 122, BP 84/32 --> 58/18,
O2 98%. She was noted to be lethargic and was given Narcan. She
was intubated with succinylcholine, etomidate, vecuronium; she
received a repeat dose of etomidate at 0345. She received a
total of 5 L NS and code sepsis was initiated. Right IJ was
placed. She received vancomycin 1 g IV X 1, levofloxacin 750 mg
IV X 1, flagyl 500 mg IV X 1, zofran 4 mg, and zosyn 4.5 mg IV X
1. She was on levophed gtt but this was weaned to off at 0430
due to hypertension (160s systolic).

ROS (obtained at OSH): + subjective fever, no chills. no chest
pain, diaphoresis, DOE, orthopnea, edema. + cough but
nonproductive. + nausea/diarrhea, jaundice, vomiting, anorexia.
Denies hematemesis, hematochezia, melena. + dizziness. + cold
intolerance. + easy bruising/bleeding. Denied suicidal ideation.

Past Medical History:
hepatitis C
h/o hepatitis B (per records from OSH)
h/o pancreatitis
h/o IVDU
depression/anxiety
h/o kidney stones per mother

Social History:
Recently in prison for DUI/reckless driving and drug
convictions. Then let out of prison to rehab in [**Location (un) 86**] and
returned to home about one week ago. No permanent housing at
present. Living at a shelter or with a male friend per mother. +
alcohol use this week, though until last week was at a
rehab/shelter in [**Location (un) 86**] and presumably was not drinking. +
heroin use (within last 24-96 hours by report). + tobacco, 1
ppd.

STUDIES:
========
CT Abd / Pelvis [**2152-2-12**]
1. Dense bilateral large consolidations with small associated
pleural effusion, worrisome for pneumonia.

2. Abdominal fluid, periportal edema and pericholecystic fluid,
consistent with volume overload.

3. Left renal cortical defect probably indicative of remote
pyelonephritis.

4. Heterogenous liver consistent with hepatitis.

5. Retroperitoneal edema.

.

[**2-13**] RUQ US
RUQ focused ultrasound: There is a small amount of perihepatic
ascites. The right, left, and middle hepatic veins demonstrate
appropriate flow, although waveforms are not triphasic. The
portal vein demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow.

IMPRESSION: The hepatic veins demonstrates normal flow but
non-triphasic waveforms that may be due to decrease complicance
secondary to diffuse hepatic disease.
.
CTA ABD / PELVIS
[**2-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in bibasilar pulmonary consolidations
suggests an interval improvement in the underlying pneumonia.

2. Interval development of the anasarca, bilateral pleural
effusion, and progression of the ascitic fluid suggests volume
overload status.

3. Mild thickening of sigmoid and descending colon. This most
likely reflects colitis-probably C Diff. . No evidence of bowel
ischemia is noted.

4. Stable left renal cortical defect probably indicative of
remote pyelonephritis.
.
tte [**2-18**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen on this technically
suboptimal study
.
CT ABD /PELVIS 3.21
1. Interval improvement in both bilateral consolidations and
pleural effusions.
2. Anasarca with no significant change in ascites and pelvic
free fluid.
3. Cortical thinning at the site of likely old infection in the
left kidney.

.
TTE [**2-25**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/
