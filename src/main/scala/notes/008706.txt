Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2192-2-24**]
Sinus tachycardia. Atrial ectopy. No previous tracing available
for  comparison.

CHEST XR [**2-24**]
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are normal. There is no evidence of
pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is
at the upper range of normal, there are no signs indicative of
overhydration. Moderate  tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The
hilar and mediastinal contours are  unremarkable. There is no
abnormal parenchymal density, notably no indication for the
presence of atelectasis or pneumon

EMG [**2192-2-27**]
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for
moderate median
neuropathies at both wrists and for a mild, chronic L5
radiculopathy on the left. The impersistent upper extremity F
waves would be consistent with early Guillian-[**Location (un) **] syndrome;
however, there was no other evidence for this entity. This may
be due to the fact that the study was performed only 4 days into
the course; if concern remains for a demyelinating
polyneuropathy (as in Guillian-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome), this test could
be repeated in [**1-27**] weeks as it may be normal in very early
cases. The poor activation seen in most muscles tested on needle
EMG may be due to pain, poor patient effort, or central nervous
system dysfunction.

LYME SEROLOGY (Final [**2192-3-1**]):
      NO ANTIBODY TO B. BURGDORFERI DETECTED BY EIA.
      Reference Range:  No antibody detected.
      Negative results do not rule out B. burgdorferi infection.
 Patients
      in early stages of infection or on antibiotic therapy may
not produce
      detectable levels of antibody.  Patients with clinical
history and/or
      symptoms suggestive of lyme disease should be retested in
[**2-28**] weeks.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-2-25**]):
      NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
      This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method,
please refer to
      hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..

   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2192-2-28**]):    NO GROWTH.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 years old left handed man with significant past medical
history for asthma, hyperlipidemia presenting with rapidly
progressive weakness involving proximal
muscles and muscle pain and arreflexia. There is no evidence of
sensory changes. The clinical presentation is suggestive of
[**Month/Day/Year 7816**] -[**Location (un) **] Syndrome. CSF showed elevated protein and EMG
showed mild signs of early [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome. Patient
received 5 days course of IVIG with remarkable improvement of
the strenght. He started to walk on [**2192-2-28**]. Physical exam upon
discharge showed mostly 5/5 strength in the main muscle group
tested: Deltoid/ biceps/ triceps/wrist/ finger extension 5-/5
Left weaker than right/IP/Hams/Quads/gastroc/. Patient presented
pain in diferent areas of the body. Neurontin 300mg TID was
initiated on [**2192-3-1**].

His respiratory status has been stable. As per his PCP
[**Name9 (PRE) 81148**] level was drawn before discharge to be checked as
outpatient. He also received prescription with 10 days taper of
prednisone.
