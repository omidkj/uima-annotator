Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral arm heaviness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-2-23**] Cardiac catheterization- drug-eluting stent to left
anterior descending coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 54011**] is an 86 year old female with a PMH significant for
CAD s/p PCI with DES to LAD, PDA, and RCA in [**2097**] and DES x2 to
mid-LAD in [**2-/2104**] for in-stent restenosis, now presenting with
anterior/septal STEMI s/p another DES to proximal-LAD.
.
Patient states she has been feeling bilateral arm heaviness for
past 2-3 weeks. Heaviness was intermittent, spontaneous in onset
and self-alleviating. She denies increased heaviness with
exertion and has had no dyspnea or orthopnea. Arm heaviness has
been increasing in frequency until it was especially heavy this
morning. This is the same arm heaviness she presented with the
last two times she had STEMIs requiring coronary stents. This
arm pain has been noted to be her anginal equivalent. She denies
any associated chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
nausea, vomiting, or pain radiating to the arm, back, or jaw.
.
She presented to an OSH, where ECG was notable for STE in aVR,
V1, V2 with STD in inferior leads and V4-V6. She was given
aspirin, and started on a nitroglycerin and heparin gtt, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. She was taken emergently to cardiac
cath. She was given 5mg IV lopressor for tachycardia. She was
bolused with Integrilin and then on a drip. She was found to
have diffuse in-stent restenosis in the proximal LAD to >90%,
now s/p DES. Patient received total 400 cc ivf, 215 contrast.
Right groin was angiosealed, and pt transferred to CCU in stable
condition.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD s/p drug-eluting stents to LAD, PDA, RCA ([**2097**]), as well
as acute very late in-stent thrombosis of proximal LAD stent on
[**2104-2-6**].
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Chronic low back pain


Social History:
Lives with son, husband recently died.
Tobacco - none. EtOH - none. Denies IV, illicit, or herbal drug
use.


Family History:
No early CAD.

CARDIAC CATH REPORT ([**2105-2-23**])
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a
50%
distal plaque that extends into both the LAD and LCx ostium, and
appears
to be essentially unchanged from prior angiography done in
2/[**2104**].  The
LAD had diffuse ISRS - was noted to be mild proximally but
tapers to a
focal lesion of ~90%.  TIMI 2 flow was noted in the distal LAD.
A
sizeable singular diagonal branch was patent and unchanged from
prior.
The LCx was noted to be retroflexed and tortuous proximally,
with an
ostial lesion of 40%.  The proximal segment was diffusely
diseased but
appears unchanged (50-60% stenosis).  The RCA had mild diffuse
plaquing
with patent stents and a normal flow pattern.
2. Successful PCI of proximal LAD in-stent restonsis (new lesion
and
culprit for STEMI presentation) with 3.0x12mm Promus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-dilated to
3.25mm (see PTCA comments).
3. Residual disease (distal bifurcation LMCA, ostial LAD/LCx,
proximal
LCx) to be treated medically and revascularization if clinically

indicated.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 122/65, mean 74
mmHg.
5. Successful closure of the R CFA access site with 6F AngioSeal
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. 90% ISRS in proximal LAD successfully treated with primary
angioplasty and 3.0 x 12mm Promus DES, post-dilated to 3.25mm.
3. Residual disease (distal bifurcation LMCA, ostial LAD/LCx,
proximal
LCx) to be treated medically, with revascularization if
clinically
indicated.
4. Systemic arterial normotension.
5. Integrilin IV gtt for 6 hours.
6. Reload with plavix 300 mg today (previously on 75 mg daily)
and
then continue plavix 75 mg daily. Assess for discontinuation of
plavix
after a minimum of [**12-28**] months (patient had very late stent
thrombosis
in [**2104**] and is not a prasugrel candidate due to age).
7. Continue aspirin 162 mg minimum daily indefinitely.
8. Global CV risk reduction strategies.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHO ([**2105-2-23**]):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %)
secondary to moderate global hypokinesis sparing only the
inferior free wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to t
