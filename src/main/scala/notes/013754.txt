Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Hydrochlorothiazide / Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2106-9-7**] Mitral Valve Replacement(27mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine)
and Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, vein graft to PDA).

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 109949**] is a 76 year old female with worsening shortness of
breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Echocardiogram in
[**2106-8-11**] showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with
an LVEF of 40%. There was evidence of pulmonary hypertension
with a PASP aroung 40mmHg. Subsequent cardiac catheterization
revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and
confirmed severe mitral regurgitation. There was mild systolic
ventricular dysfunction, with an LVEF around 42%. PASP was
estimated at 60mmHg. Based upon the above, she was referred for
cardiac surgical intervention.

Pertinent Results:
[**2106-9-7**] - ECHO: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. 2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. 3. There is mild to moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with
somewhat worse hypokinesis of the apical segment. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Given the degree of mitral regurgitation, intrinsic left
ventricular function is likely more depressed. 4. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis with more severe apical
hypokinesis. 5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 6. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet tip and slight
retraction of the posterior leaflet. There is moderate to severe
(3+), mostly central, mitral regurgitation. 8. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 8.There is a trivial
pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: The patient is receiving
epinephrine by infusion. 1. Right ventricular systolic function
is improved. The apical segment may still be mildly hypokinetic.
2. Left ventricular systolic function is also improved. Ef now
about 50%. No obvious focal defects. 3. There is a bioprosthetic
valve in the mitral position. It is well seated with normal
leaflet function. There is trace perivalvular mitral
regurgitation. The maximum gradient across the valve is 13 mm Hg
with a mean of 6 mm Hg. 4. Aortic contours post-decannulation
are intact.
[**9-10**] CXR: Small improvement in right apical pneumothorax.
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 109949**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up prior to admission. On day of admission
she was brought directly to the operating room where she
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve
replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Beta
blocker and diuretics were initiated following patient being
weaned from Inotropes. She was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight. CXR on post-op day one revealed a right
pneumothorax. Her HCT trended down and on post-op day two was
found to be 20.7. She was transfused two units of blood with an
adequate rise to almost 29. She appeared stable and was
transferred to the SDU for further management on post-op day
two. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. She did have a mild to moderate right-sided
pneumothorax after chest tube removal. This appeared to diminish
by time of discharge. Over the next several days she remained
stable and slowly improved without complications. She worked
with physical therapy for strength and mobility. On post-op day
five she appeared to be doing well and was discharged home with
vna services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
