ADMISSION H&P:  Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 101729**] is a 61-year-old female with a
past medical history of hypercholesterolemia, positive
Persantine thallium study, arthritis and occult guaiac
positive rectal exam who presented with a complaint of
shortness of breath for over the duration of one month with
progressive dyspnea on exertion.  She denied any history of
chest pain, reflex dysphasia or odynophagia and presented for
coronary catheterization on [**2196-2-11**].  The findings of
catheterization were that she had an ejection fraction of 36%
in anterior basal and posterior basal normal function and
her anterior lateral, apical and inferior margins were
hypokinetic.  Her right coronary artery had a discrete
proximal stenosis of 60% to 70%.  Her mid obtuse marginal
distal RCA and posterior descending arteries were all normal.
Her left main had a stenosis of approximately 40% with
diagonal stenosis of 90%.  The proximal LAD was 80%,
intermediate LAD was 90% and the middle LAD was approximately
60%.  The distal LAD was 40%.  The circumflex was normal and
the obtuse marginal was normal.  Her right sided heart
pressures were a mean of approximately 12 mmHg.  Her PAP was
38, 20 and 26 and her left ventricular end diastolic pressure
was 20.  She had moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Degenerative joint disease.
2.  Pneumonia in [**2189**].
3.  Occult blood one time on a recent screening exam.

ALLERGIES:  She has no allergies to any known drugs.

PREVIOUS MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po qd.
2.  Prempro 0.625/2.5 mg po qd.
3.  Elavil 20 mg po q p.m.
4.  Naprosyn 500 mg po bid.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Tubal ligation.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  She was 5 foot 1.5 inches tall with a weight of
171 pounds.  Her blood pressure was 142/82 on the left.  On
the right it was 135/80.  Her pulse was 68.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC:  Without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She had a normal
S1 and S2.  She had palpable DP and PT arteries bilaterally.

After her catheterization, cardiothoracic surgery was
consulted and plans were made to perform coronary artery
bypass graft on [**2196-2-12**] on hospital day #2.  On hospital day
#2, she went to the Operating Room, where she underwent
coronary artery bypass graft x4 vessels with a left internal
mammary artery to LAD and vein to diagonal ramus and the
right coronary artery.  The patient was then transferred to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit where she was
extubated shortly thereafter and out of bed on postoperative
day #1.  Her chest tube was maintained until postoperative
day #2; it was discontinued.

On postoperative day #2, she was evaluated by physical
therapy and her dressing on postoperative day #3 while taken
down, revealed some serosanguinous drainage.  Her midline
sternotomy was then painted with Betadine and dressed with a
dry sterile dressing twice daily over the next couple of
days.  She was ambulating and able to take care of herself
with clear lungs and extremely minimal drainage from her
midline incision, therefore plans were made to discharge her
on postoperative day #5.  That morning, it was noted that she
had a run of a questionable ventricular tachycardia on her
telemetry monitoring.  However, the
electrophysiology/cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the
impression was that this was an artifact with a QRS wave and
the patient would not require any further evaluation.
Therefore, plans were made to discharge the patient home.

DISPOSITION:  Discharge to home

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg po bid.
2.  K-Dur 20 milliequivalents po q day x7 days.
3.  Lasix 20 mg po qd x7 days.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg po q hs.
5.  ASA 81 mg po qd.
6.  Elavil 20 mg po q p.m.
7.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets po q 3 to 4 hours.
8.  Colace 100 mg po bid.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow up with the
nurses on Far Six for a wound check in approximately one
week, to follow up with her primary care physician in one to
two weeks and to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks.
She can continue Betadine painting and dressings with dry
sterile gauze twice daily until her midline sternotomy heals.
