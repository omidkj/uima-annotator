Brief Hospital Course:
46 year old woman with asthma who was admitted with GI bleed.
She used NSAID for menstrual pain. She had an acute onset of
melena consistent with upper GI bleed (although NG lavage
reportedly negative in ED). However, upper endoscopy revealed no
source of bleeding. The colonoscopy showed dry blood in the
cecum which confirmed the suspicion of a higher bleed. At
admission, the patient's HCT was 19 but she remained
hemodynamically stable with HR 90s-100s, normal BP, and normal
mental status. She was initially treated with PPI drip but
changed to PO PPI after negative upper endoscopy. She was
transfused 3 units PRBCs and HCT rose appropriately. She was
monitored for additional 24 hours after her colonoscopy and 30
hours after her last transfusion with stable HCT. Her last bowel
movement on the day of discharge was completely normal. She
therefore requested discharge. Of note she had leukocytosis
related to stress reaction for GI bleed and had no other
localizing symptoms/signs of infection. The patient was
discharged on Iron. She may need repeat EGD or capsule endoscopy
if she gets recurrent GI bleed. No NSAIDS. She will have a close
follow up with PCP/GI to discuss the indications for Capsule
endoscopy. She was informed about symptoms/signs of bleeding.
