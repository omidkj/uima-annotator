This medication list was compiled from the patient's doctor's
office and may include some medications that the patient is
not currently taking and by report of the patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 100645**], the patient frequently does not take her medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband.  She is
a nonsmoker, nondrinker.  She has a son who lives in the area
as well as a daughter in [**Name (NI) 531**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
95.6, heart rate 74, blood pressure 187/80, 94% on room air,
respirations 19.  General:  She is a chronically ill
cachectic, elderly female moaning.  HEENT:  The oropharynx
was slightly erythematous.  There were dry mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  There was a II/VI
systolic murmur in the left lower sternal border.  Lungs:
Decreased at the left bases, crackles bilaterally.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds.  No rebound
tenderness.  Guaiac negative brown stool.  Extremities:  No
edema.  Dorsalis pedis palpable.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Significant for a white count of
14.8, hematocrit 53.5 which is elevated for her but the
patient is chronically polycythemic from her [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **],
platelets 798,000, 89.5 neutrophils, 7 lymphs, 0 monos.
Chem-7 was normal.  The patient's initial CK was 21 and
troponin less than 0.01.  The patient's LFTs were normal and
albumin was 4.8.

The patient's U/A did not show evidence of a urinary tract
infection.

The patient's chest x-ray showed left midzone
consolidation/collapse and a large left-sided pleural
effusion which is new from previous x-rays but has been seen
on x-rays here as recently as last year.

An EKG was sinus with right bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  ABNORMAL CHEST X-RAY:  Given the
patient's nonspecific complaints and lack of further
information for the patient in the OMR secondary to a new MR
number being assigned in the ER, the patient underwent a CT
of the torso while in the ER.  The CT demonstrated left upper
lobe with a dense consolidation as well as a small opacity,
1.7 by 1.2 cm in the right upper lobe as well as a large
left-sided pleural effusion and some small pretracheal nodes.
Abdomen and pelvis were within normal limits.  Given this new
pleural effusion, the patient had a thoracentesis the night
of admission which demonstrated an exudative effusion with
600 white cells, 54 lymphs, 5 polys, 9 mesothelials, 29
macrophages, and 15,000 reds.  The Gram's stain was negative
and the AFP was negative on direct smear.

Given the concern for possible tuberculosis infection, the
patient was placed on respiratory precautions the following
day.  However, the patient's story was much much more
suspicious for a malignancy and indeed two days following
admission the cytology for the pleural fluid was positive for
adenocarcinoma, either metastatic from breast or new lung
adenoma CA.  The patient had two negative AFB sputums and a
negative PPD and her respiratory precautions were
discontinued.

Oncology was consulted.  At this time, they are awaiting
further stains to determine whether it is metastatic or lung
cancer as this will determine possibility of further
(palliative) treatment.  On chest x-ray following the
thoracentesis, a small 10% apical pneumothorax was
demonstrated.  Interventional Pulmonary was consulted.  They
felt that the malignant effusion and pneumothorax warranted a
pleurex catheter with pleuroscopy and possible pleurodesis.
However, because the patient had been on Plavix, they would be
unable to do it for five to seven days. They did a bronchoscopy
with normal bronchi seen and no abnormalities on [**2169-5-18**].

The patient did have an oxygen requirement during her
hospital stay.  The patient was 88% on [**4-6**] liters after the
revealing of the pneumothorax.  The patient was placed on
100% nonrebreather.  She was 100% on this.  On room air, the
patient was approximately 88% oxygen saturation without
shortness of breath except on exertion.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient, two days
following admission, became acutely more short of breath.  An
ABG demonstrated respiratory acidosis and on examination, the
patient sounded wet and she was then diuresed 2 liters with
some improvement in her sats and symptoms.  The patient was
continued to be diuresed as her daily chest x-rays revealed
worsening pulmonary edema, although no change in the apical
pneumothorax.  Her oxygen saturations remained 92-94% on [**4-6**]
liters, 100% on 100% nonrebreather mask.

The patient did undergo a bedside echocardiogram in the
hospital which demonstrated diastolic dysfunction with a
normal EF and moderate aortic stenosis.

3.  ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Outside records were obtained from
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital which demonstrated that the patient had a
recent EGD with duodenal ulcer.  Her stools had been Guaiac
negative.  The patient was treated with Protonix and
sucralfate and this appeared to improve her symptoms
dramatically.

4.  QUESTIONABLE PNEUMONIA:  The patient did initially have a
white count on admission but no fever.  She was started on
levo and Flagyl for a possible postobstructive pneumonia.
Her white count decreased.  She should be continued on the
Levo and Flagyl for at least ten days and possibly until
after the interventional pulmonary procedure is completed.

5.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient initially was in acute
renal failure which was prerenal by electrolytes.  She was
given some IV fluids but secondary to CHF, the patient was
encouraged to take p.o.  Her creatinine did improve during
her hospital course.

6.  POLYCYTHEMIA [**Doctor First Name **]:  The patient was continued on her
Hydrea in-house.

7.  CODE STATUS/END OF LIFE AND COMMUNICATION ISSUES:  During
initial family meeting with the patient and her husband,
using a [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter, the patient said that she did
not want to be intubated or resuscitated.  However, after
calling the son to
