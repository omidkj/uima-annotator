Admission Date:  [**2116-5-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2116-5-25**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 79-year-old male
with history of hypertension transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit following respiratory failure and hypercapnia on the
floor requiring intubation.  History from spouse since the
patient is intubated and sedated reports approximately 1-1.5
weeks ago the patient started to complain of a cold (with
productive cough, increased shortness of breath, and dyspnea
on exertion).  Called the PCP who started Zithromax for
presumed community acquired pneumonia, no chest x-ray, no
culture, or data.

The patient's symptoms increased to the point where he is not
able to sleep secondary to shortness of breath.  No chest
pain, no palpitations, no weight changes, or lower extremity
edema.  Wife reports increased dyspnea on exertion.  He could
not walk in the room without becoming extremely short of
breath, fatigue, and decided the morning of admission to go
to the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency Department,
the patient was found to be nonresponsive.  Arterial blood
gas showed 7.14, 72, 109 on CPAP.  Laboratories showed a BMP
of 690, normal less than 150 with a chest x-ray showing
bilateral pulmonary edema.  The patient was started on CPAP
and diuresed with Lasix.  His symptoms improved and the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further care.

Upon arrival to the floor, he was found to be lethargic with
decreased responsiveness.  Arterial blood gas showed 7.10,
96, and 41.  The patient was intubated and transferred to the
CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hyperlipidemia.
3. Osteomyelitis at age 14.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Timolol 10 mg [**Hospital1 **].
2. Norvasc 5 mg po q day.
3. Lipitor 10 mg q day.
4. Zithromax for two days.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Rectal cancer and coronary artery disease.
Smoker quit 30 years ago, approximately 60 pack years.
Patient no alcohol use.  Lives at home with wife, two
children in area.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  He was sedated and intubated, no
jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.  Oropharynx is
clear.  Mucous membranes moist.  Cardiovascular:
Tachycardic, III/VI systolic murmur radiating to both
carotids.  PMI increased, but not to place, soft S2.
Pulmonary:  Unable to properly assess.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds positive.  Extremities:
 No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 13.3, hematocrit 39.1,
platelets 267, INR of 1.2.  Urine is positive for blood.
Chem-7:  Sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN
18, creatinine of 1, platelets of 292, magnesium of 1.6, PO4
is 6.2, calcium 8.7.  AST 88, ALT of 44, LDH 231, alkaline
phosphatase 109.  T bilirubin of 0.7, lactate of 1.6.  CK 86
increased to 102, troponin 3.3, MB index of 9.8.

Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm, normal axis, left
ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial abnormality, ST changes
in precordial leads, ST depressions in V5 and V6, ST
elevations, normal intervals.  More pronounced when
tachycardic.

A transthoracic echocardiogram for this patient showed severe
aortic stenosis with approximate valve area of 0.7.  This was
followed by a cardiac catheterization on [**2116-5-11**] and found
to have a pulmonary capillary wedge of 14 with severe aortic
stenosis, mean gradient of 65 mm and a valve area of 0.54.
He also had diffuse coronary artery disease with 20% left
main, a 60% left anterior descending artery, a mid and
proximal circumflex lesion of approximately 30%, right
coronary artery of mid 40% and 100% distal right coronary
artery.

The patient did rule in for myocardial infarction.  CT Surgery
was consulted to assess for aortic valve replacement and CABG. CT
Surgery agreed that aortic valve replacement/CABG  was indicated
in this patient.
Preoperative evaluation revealed a 90-100% stenosis of the
right coronary artery. In view of the heavily calcified aorta and
therefore the need for circulatory arrest during surgery it was
felt that the risk of stroke was high and would require carotid
intervention prior to that. After careful review of the options
carotid stenting was recommended. This was successfully performed
on [**5-14**]. He was then put on aspirin and Plavix with
plans to wait two weeks for the surgery while controlling the
patient's heart failure on the floor.  Patient was extubated
and did well in the CCU.  He was transferred to the PCU
subsequently.
While in the PCU the patient had a recurrent episode of pulmonary
edema requiring transfer back to the CCU as well as reintubation
He also developed hemoptysis which was evaluated and felt to be
predominantly related to his CHF.An IABP was place on [**5-19**] to
optimize his hemodynamics and surgery was scheduled for [**5-21**].
Prior to the scheduled surgery the patient developed a
leukocytosis with gm + cocci in his sputum. The surgery was
cancelled by the cardiac surgical team and the patient evaluated
by ID. Antibiotic treatment was advised and their recommendations
followed. Although there was a concern about a positive blood
culture as well that was ultimately concluded to probably be a
contaminant.
The patient was successfully extubated on [**5-22**]. While in the CCU
the patient had some recurrent hemoptysis (evaluated by
pulmonary) and he began to develop renal insufficiency.On [**5-24**] he
was noted to have an ischemic left lower extremity despite being
on systemic heparin . He was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]-
the IABP was removed. The renal service was also consulted due to
a rising creatinine and they felt that the acute renal failure
was possibly related to emboli from the IABP/aorta.CT surgery did
not feel there was any role for urgent cardiac surgery at this
time.

On the night of [**5-24**], patient developed high
grade transaminitis with AST and ALTs in the thousands, mild
scleral icterus with bilirubin approximately 1.5. Lactate was
initially stable throughout the night in the range of [**2-24**], but
then rose dramatically to 9.

In addition, the patient began to decompensate with
hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine and dopamine drips as
well as fluid boluses to maintain MAPS above 90.  He was also
having seizure-like activity and required increased doses of
Fentanyl, diazepam, and Haldol for sedation.

As the patient's condition deteriorated, CCU fellow and
attending were contact[**Name (NI) **] as well as Surgery to evaluate for a
possible mesenteric ischemia and acute abdomen.  The team was
united in feeling that any intervention at this time would be
a high risk of mortality and more likely that would not only
prolong an inevitable decline.  The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
told of the patient's grave prognosis and instructed to come
in as soon as possible.

Family arrived, and the seriousness of the condition and
prognosis were explained to them.  After discussion, the
family decided that it would not be consistent with the
wishes of Mr. [**Known lastname 22917**] to become dialysis dependent or
prolonged existence on a ventilator.  Spiritual counseling
was brought in the early morning of [**5-25**].  The family
decided to withdraw care.  Given the underlying medical
conditions, the Medical and Surgical teams involved fully
agreed with this decision.  Mr. [**Known lastname 22917**] passed away at 7:45 am
on [**5-25**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory arrest secondary to congestive
heart failure and renal failure.

HOSPITALIZATION DIAGNOSES:
1. Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Pneumonia.
5. Hemoptysis.
6. Acute renal failure.
7. Acute hepatitis.
8. Lower extremity vascular arterial thromboembolism.
9. Probable mesenteric ischemia.
10. Hypertension.
