Patient lives alone before [**3-22**], uses walker usually. She fell

fracture, she has been on wheelchair x 6 month. At [**Hospital 100**] rehab,
her course was complicated by pneumonia and pulmonary edema. She
was then diagnosed with PE on [**2123-5-21**]. She was intially on
lovenox, then switch to coumadin and was complicated by thigh
bleed and Hct drop to 22. SHe was then switched again to
lovenox. According to the son, patient had been on 2L of oxygen
since admission to [**Hospital 100**] rehab and one week ago it was 90% on
2L. Her sats dropped to high 80s on 2L and she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for concern of new PE.

In ED, her initial vitals were T98.2 P108 BP129/85 R22 80%on RA.
She received 500cc in EMS. CTA show no new PE and small
bilateral pleural effusion. BNP was 16K. She received 10mg lasix
and put out 600ml urine to that. She also received diltiazem
240mg because ED thought that she did not get that at [**Hospital 100**]

tachycardic to 110s-140s. SHe was treated with another lasix

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with history of hypertension, AF and recent bilateral
pulmonary embolism presents with hypoxia
.
# hypoxia:no fever/pneumonia, no signs of bronchospasm, no EKG
changes/chest pain, CTA has no new PE, BNP 16K and CT did show
bilateral pleural effusion, echo [**5-11**] show nml EF, mild LVH and
mod pulm HTN; likely pulmonary congestion from uncontrolled
AF(??did not get medication)
- lasix and aim for net negative 1.5-2L
- will attempt nebulizer
- control AF with diltiazem and metoprolol
- cycle CE and keep on telemetry
.
# PE- continue lovenox
.
# atrial fibrillation
- continue on metoprolol and diltiazem
.
# anemia: baseline Hct 30 per NH record
- continue FE sulfate
.
# hyperkalemia- no EKG changes, hemolyzed lab, recheck in AM
.
# FEN-nectar thick liquid
.
# code- full code(dicuss with health care proxy, [**Name (NI) 449**]
.
# PPX- already on lovenox, PPI, bowel regimen
.
# dispo- pending improvement in respiratory status
