Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation x 2
2. Central line placement
3. Arterial line placement
4. Mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 66 y o F with PMH significant for COPD, stroke,
on chronic coumadin, who prsented to the ED at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
with 4 days of chst pain.  The patient states that she had
fallen 4 days prior and developed shoulder pain subsequently.
She called EMS because she "wasn't getting better."  EMS vitals
100/60 HR 104.  She received 4 ASA 81 mg en route.  At [**Hospital1 1474**],
she was treated with IV solumedrol and albuterol nebulizers as
well as avelox 400 mg IV, morphine, and ativan.  She also
received vitamin K 5 mg PO x1.  Troponin level at [**Hospital1 1474**] was
intermediate and she wsa transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to no ICU beds
at [**Hospital1 1474**].

In the emergency department at [**Hospital1 18**], notable for SaO2= 81% on
room air.  Her blood pressure decreased transiently to 70s/40s,
with heart rates >100.  She was sent to the ICU with O2 Sat 98%
on NRB.  She receive azithromycin 500 PO x1 and combivent nebs.
CTA done to eval for PE was negative for PE but showed
emphysematous change, and pulmonary nodules.  On arrival to the
ICU, the patient was breathing more comfortably.  She stated
that her chest pain, which was substernal in nature, was
pleuritic, and worse with palpation, but had resolved.
+non-productive cough.  Denies recent fever, chills,
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea.  Did not see her PCP when she felt
worse several days ago

Pertinent Imaging:
CTA Chest [**2-16**]: IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2.
Extensive, moderately severe emphysema. Small area of
bronchiectasis within the right lower lobe with surrounding
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities could reflect an element of inflammation/
respiratory bronchiolitis. No large focal areas of consolidation
are noted. Prominent hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are
likely reactive. 3. Scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to
8 mm. A dedicated chest CT followup examination in 3 - 6 months
is recommended to establish initial stability. 4. Extensive
calcific atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary
arteries.
.
ECHO [**2-20**]: IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricular
cavity with depressed free wall contractility. There may be a
mass in the apex of the right ventricle. This is most likely due
to prominent trabeculations although a thrombus or other mass
cannot be excluded. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe
pulmonary artery artery systolic hypertension.  EF 45-50%.

RUE US [**2-27**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper
extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient was admitted to the MICU
service on [**2112-2-16**] for a COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.  She
was treated with steroids, antibiotics (vanco, ceftriaxone,
azithromycin), nebs.  She became acutely short of breath and
required BiPAP.  On [**2112-2-19**], the patient appeared tired despite
intermittent BiPAP and the patient was intubated after a
discussion with the patient and the patient's daughter.  A right
internal jugular venous catheter was placed for access, and an
arterial line was placed for closer monitoring.  The patient was
extubated on [**2-22**], and was intitially tachycardic and
hypertensive.  Her blood pressure was controlled initially with
a nitro gtt.  Low dose benzodiazepines also helped the patient's
comfort and respiratory distress.  The patient required BiPAP
intermittantly, but was weaned off prior to transfer to the
floor on [**2-25**].

Initially she was doing well on the floor.  On [**2-26**] she was
doing well on 4L NC, but apparently her O2 tubing was found to
have a malfunction such that she was not receiving as much O2 as
thought (2.5L vs. 4L).  She was noted to become acutely short of
breath.  She was initially hypoxic to 58% on pulse ox while on
2.5L nc, and was cyanotic.  She was put on 100% NRB, and ABG was
7/41/55/61.  However, she remained dyspneic with increased work
of breathing and accessory muscle use.  Nasal BiPAP was placed
on the floor, and the patient became much more comfortable, with
O2 sat 93%.  She remained hemodynamically stable, but was
transferred back to the MICU for further management.  She was
reintubated on [**2-27**] for continued respiratory distress.  She
remained intubated until [**3-1**].  She was extubated with nitro gtt
at bedside.  The patient tolerated extubation well and was
placed on a nebulizer, then weaned to nasal cannula. She
tolerated her home O2 (3L), and her respiratory status was
watched closely.  She was given frequent nebulizer treatments
and incentive spirometry was encouraged. Her steroids were
tapered.

2. Psychiatry: The patient had a psychiatric consultation on
[**3-1**] prior to extubation for concern about the patient's ability
to make decisions for herself.  The patient exhibited variable
desire for intubation, extubation and re-intubation.  A
Psychiatry consultation revealed that the patient had delerium
and was not able to make her own decisions.  All decisions were
finalized with the health care proxy (daughter), who desired to
proceed with re-intubation if necessary, and would consider
tracheostomy in the future.  The patient was extubaed, and
remained clnically improved, on baseline 3 L/min NC.

3. CAD: Patient with history of CAD.  Upon admission, troponins
were cycled, givne patient's complaint of chest pain.  First set
was equivocal (0.10), subsequent 2 sets trended down.  Cardiac
enzymes were
