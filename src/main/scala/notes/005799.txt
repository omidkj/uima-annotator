Pertinent Results:
CT: There is a large metallic foreign body in the left posterior
fossa. At the left cerebellopontine angle is a 2.4 cm focus of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  There is diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage within the basal cisterns.  There is a large degree
of
mass effect on the pons at the level of the middle cerebellar
peduncles, left greater than right and effacement of the
quadrigeminal cistern.  The supratentorial ventricles and sulci
are grossly normal.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  The surrounding soft tissue structures show soft
tissue swelling over the right lateral face
with air tracking into the medial to the right mandibular
condyle
and within the temporal fossa.  The surrounding osseous
structures show fracture of the left skull base with few bony
fragments sitting in the inferior aspect of the left posterior
fossa.  The imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses show
mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells and fluid
filling
the nasopharynx.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and emergently brought to the OR for bilateral
posterior craniotomy and placement of EVD. Patient tolerated the
procedure and was sent to the T/SICU for close monitoring.
Initially she remained unresponsive, and would not open her
eyes, but her pupils remained equal and reactive, she localized
to pain with her left UE, and withdrew to pain with BLE's. She
was started on mannitol and decadron postoperatively. Post-op CT
revealed expected postoperative changes.
[**10-23**] transfused, tf's started
[**10-24**] trach/peg
[**10-25**] transfused she was transferred to the neurostep down unit,
where neurologically she began making excellent neurologic
process, she began moving her extremities to command, opening
her eyes and tracking the examiner and attempting to mouth
words.
On [**10-29**] she had her left hand bullet wound repaired by plastics
without difficulty.  We began to wean her ventriculostomy drain
to 15 mm above the trageus. She had low grade fevers in 101
range, she had multiple cultures which were negative and no sign
of csf leak from bullet enterance on right side of face.  We
consulted ID to assist with fevers but also to suggest need or
need of antibiotics due to bullet fragment.  Neurologically she
continued to improve following commands and answering yes/no
questions appropriately.

ID recommended full culture work which has been negative with
exception of gram + rods in sputum.  An abd CT showed no source
of infection.  Ceftriaxone was started for broader coverage
recommended full 14 days of treatmen.

Her ventricular drain was gradually raised and pulled on [**11-4**]
her follow up CTs showed small ventricles her neurologic status
improved on a daily basis.  She was following commands and
orientated X3 when given choices.  She had left arm weakness.

On [**11-5**] her sutures were removed and middle portion of the
incision was noted to have an open area she was resutured and
started on a two weeks of Keflex.

She pulled out her PEG on [**11-1**] and repeat swallowing test showed
aspiration so a new PEG was placed by IR on [**11-6**].

On [**11-10**], Tracheostomy Tube was downsized from #8 portex to #6
portex at bedside.
Patient d/c'd to rehab on [**11-10**].
