Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from outside hospital for respiratory failure and shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical ventilation
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old man with a history of COPD, CAD,
CHF who presents with respiratory failure, transferred from an
OSH.
.
Per the OSH records, patient had a gradual onset of shortness of
breath over the 24 hours prior to admission.  Also with cough;
no reported fevers or chills.
.
Per EMS report, "pt had been having difficulty breathing and
chest pain since yesterday which worsened this morning...Pt
states pain and difficulty breathing began at the same time...he
points just to the (R) of his sternum and on his sternum
mid-chest when asked for the location of the pain.  O2 sat 97%
on NRB."
.
Vitals at the OSH showed a temparature of 97.2, BP of 114/90, HR
90, RR 35 and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air.  Lungs
were reported as "diminished but clear".  The O2 deteriorated to
the 50s on 3 liters and the patient was intubated with a #8 ETT.
 Subsequently, blood pressure fell and dopamine was started.

CXR [**5-4**]
There is new right IJ line with tip in the SVC. The pacemaker is
unchanged. ET tube tip is 6.9 cm above the carina. The NG tube
tip is not well visualized. The right-sided airspace opacities
are again visualized as is volume loss/infiltrate in the left
lower lobe. The CP angles are off the film, and thus difficult
to assess for effusion on this film. Overall with exception of a
new line, there has been no significant interval change

EKG on admission:
Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular premature beat and
probably two
ventricular paced beats. Since the previous tracing of [**2165-5-5**]
ventricular
pacing is new. The first paced beat appears early and may be
related to
a non-sensed ventricular premature beat. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2165-5-7**] at 3:05:11 PM
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-50 %), most likely due
in part to the presence of reduced ventricular filling secondary
to atrial fibrillation with relatively rapid ventricular rate.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2165-5-12**] 2:49 PM

Cholelithiasis, and mild gallbladder wall thickening without
significant gallbladder distention. Wall thickening may be
secondary to underdistention of the gallbladder, or third
spacing. Given the minimal gallbladder distention, this is less
likely secondary to acute cholecystitis. Evaluation of the
common duct in the region of the pancreatic head is limited by
ultrasound technique.

US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR RIGHT  [**2165-5-12**] 2:09 PM
Focused ultrasound scanning was performed in the area of the
patient's pacemaker in the right upper chest. Pacemaker leads
are identified in the subcutaneous tissues, and there is no
evidence of surrounding fluid collection or abscess.
