Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16851**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 51 yo with PMH notable for COPD on intermittent home
O2, OSA on CPAP, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic
pain on narcotics who presented with increasing somnelence and
developed hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Mr. [**Known lastname 14323**] was in his USOH until approximately 3 days ago when
he developed progressive somnelence. His family noted that he
was very somlenent today, so they called 911. When he arrived in
the ED, initial VS were: T98.8 HR110 BP142/67 RR14 O270% on RA.
Initial ABG was notable for 7.30/80/61/41 (unclear if on O2). He
was put on a non-rebreather with sats responding to the 90s. Pt
was arousable to voice, answering simple yes/no questions. He
denied fever, chills, cough. His lungs were felt to be clear.

Because there was a question of him taking 80mg [**Hospital1 **] oxycontin
plus PRN oxycodone (home dose only 40mg [**Hospital1 **] plus PRN), he
received a dose of narcan with some response, so pt was placed
on a narcan drip. He was also started on BiPAP. However, due to
continued somnolence, worsening hypercarbia on ABG
(7.30/61/80/41 to 7.26/295/95/45), and transient hypotension to
90s, pt was intubated. Pt was not given any abx, steroids or
nebulizers in the ED.

CXR showed some haziness of the costophrenic angles bilaterally,
but no clear effusions or consolidations.

VS prior to transfer were P88, RR18, BP112/64, O2Sat: 100%.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T99.4, P96, BP159/85,
satting 95% on Assist Control (Tv500 R20 Peep10 60%FiO2).

Micro:
Blood cultures and MRSA screen are negative

[**5-28**] EKG: Artifact is present. Sinus tachycardia. Low voltage in
the precordial leads. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2204-11-24**]
the rate is faster.

[**5-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  Bilateral parenchymal opacities, worse at
the bases, left greater than right, suggestive of underlying
edema or bilateral infection superimposed on atelectasis.  PA
and lateral with better inspiratory effort may help further
characterize.

[**5-28**] CXR:
FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to
previous exam from earlier the same day at 12:35 p.m.  Interval
placement of nasogastric tube is seen, noting that the tube can
only be identified to the mid portion of the mediastinum and
should be advanced.  Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5 cm
from the carina.  Otherwise, there has been no change.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo M with h/o OSA, COPD, obesity hypoventilation, and chronic
pain on narcotics, who presented with increasing somnelence and
developed hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Active issues:
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with
concurrent narcotic/benzo use and obestity hypoventialtion on
top of poor substrate with COPD/OSA. Reportedly responded to
narcan in ED, but became hypercarbic with high FiO2. [**Month (only) 116**] be due
to decreased respiratory drive from high oxygen. Possible PNA as
pt with cough and CXR wet and so levofloxacin x 5 days was
completed during admission. Pt was brought up to ICU after
intubation in ED. His respiratory status improved and pt was
extubated approximately 16 hrs after admission. He was
transitioned from NC to room air without complication.  He was
given albuterol/ipratropium nebs PRN. On general medicine floor
patient's respiratory status remained at his baseline with no
further episodes of hypoxia.

# Somnelence: Almost certainly from hypercarbia. See above. With
improvement in respiratory status, pt became increasingly awake
and alert and returned to baseline normal function.

Chronic issues:
# Chronic pain: Significant chronic hip pain from bilateral
necrosis/replacement. Also with chronic knee pain. On extensive
narcotic regimen including oxycontin 40 po tid with oxycodone
10q6 prn breakthrough. Narcotics were held for entirety of ICU
stay due to concern for sedation and pain was well-controlled
with tylenol. On arrival to general medicine pt was restarted on
prn oxy only. This did not adequately control his pain and so he
was restarted on 40mg [**Hospital1 **] oxycontin with improved pain control
and without change in respiratory status.

# Psych: Signficant psych history including concern for
schizophrenia. Outpatient med list includes seroquel and
risperdal. Also on buspar and xanax for anxiety. Per mother, is
in process of t
