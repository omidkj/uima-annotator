History of Present Illness:
56 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] male with Crohn's disease, diverticulosis s/p
hemicolectomy times 2, type 2 diabetes, and obesity who
initially presented to OSH for shortness of breath of one week
duration and found to have bilateraly submassive PEs and
intubated for respiratory failure.
.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-7-29**]. Echo showed RB strain. Received
TPA for thrombolysis and heparin gtt was started. Vital signs
were stable and was extubated on [**2195-7-30**]. After the heparin gtt
was initiated, pt developed maroon stools mixed with BRBPR,
thought likely secondary to underlying crohn's disease. Hcts
were measured closely and fell from 40 on admission to 30
following heparin initiation. GI was consulted and pt underwent
upper endoscopy which showed no active source of bleeding.
Steroids were increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily and pt was
continued on pentasa.
.
Called out to the floor on [**2195-8-2**] with stable vital signs, but
hct dropped from 30->26 requiring transfusion of 2 units prbcs.
With bowel prep for colonoscopy planned for the next day, it was
decided to readmit patient to ICU for better monitoring of Hcts
and vital signs. Patient was never hemodynamically unstable. In
total, he has needed 4 units of PRBCs.
.
In the ICU, patient underwent colonoscopy, showing diffuse
crohn's disease consistent with a flare but no intervention was
warranted. IVC filter was placed on [**2195-8-4**], should the patient
require emergent cessation of anticoagulation secondary to large
GI bleed. Hcts  and vitals signs stable during this admission.
Bridge to coumadin has been initiated.
.
Upon reaching the floor, patient reports that he is feeling
good. Denies lightheadedness, weakness, shortness of breath,
chest pain, acute change in abdominal pain.


Past Medical History:
Type 2 Diabetes
Obestiy
Crohn's disease, with history of GI bleed
Hypertension

s/p Multiple Herniorraphy's
Arthritis


Social History:
Patient is not married but lives with significant other (female)
and lives in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19700**]. He only drinks alcohol 2x year
currently, but reports heavy alcohol use that stopped
approximately 20 years ago. He denies tobacco use. He reports
using cocaine with cessation approximately 25 years ago. He is a
former mechanic.

Family History:
No family history of blood clots, malignancy, or sudden cardiac
death. No family history of Crohn's disease. His mother passed
away from pneumonia, but also had hypertension.

Upon reaching the floor on [**2195-8-5**] until discharge, patient's
hematocrit remained between 30.4 and 37.3.
.
ECG ([**2195-7-29**]): Tracing 1.  Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay.  Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
TTE ([**2195-7-29**]): IMPRESSION: RV strain c/w acute pulmonary
embolism.
.
CTA Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis ([**2195-7-29**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive
bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the bilateral main
pulmonary arteries with extension through to the lobar,
segmental, lower lobe subsegmental branches bilaterally, as
above. Associated findings of right heart strain. 2. No evidence
of acute aortic injury. 3. Bilateral dependent
atelectasis/aspiration. 4. Small left-sided ventral abdominal
hernia containing non-obstructed loop of small bowel. Suggestion
of right-sided spigelian hernia, incompletely assessed as right
lateral aspect of the abdomen fully included.
.
ECG ([**2195-7-30**]): Tracing 2.  Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific T wave
changes. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2195-7-29**] the QRS voltage has decreased in the
limb leads. ST segment depression is less pronounced and the
ventricular rate is slower.
.
ECG ([**2195-7-31**]): Tracing 3.  Sinus rhythm. T wave inversions in
leads V1-V3. Cannot exclude ischemia.  Low QRS voltage in the
limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-7-31**] artifact
is present. T wave inversions are less pronounced
