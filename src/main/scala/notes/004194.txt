Chief Complaint:
Syncope

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71073**] is an 86 yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p CABG, AS s/p
[**Known lastname 1291**], HTN, DM2, CHF, and dementia who p/w syncope and was found
to have complete heart block. On [**1-28**], she awoke with nausea,
walked to the bathroom, became lightheaded and fell. Per the
family, she has had several syncopal episodes over the last 6
months and had been feeling general fatigue over the last 2
weeks. Denied fevers, wt loss, n/v/d. Following this episode and
fall, she presented to OSH with c/o MSK pain, but was found to
be becoming less responsive with HR in 30s. EKG showed complete
heart block with ventricular escape of 38. She received atropine
x1 with transient improvement, then had transcutaneous pacing
pads placed. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and pacemaker.

.
Studies:
 - EKG: Sinus rhythm at 64, R axis, 1st degree AV block, RBBB,
TWI III and aVF.
 - Tele: Paced at 68
 - CXR: The patient has had median sternotomy.  Cardiac
silhouette is moderately enlarged with particular left atrial
and pulmonary artery enlargement. Mild interstitial edema is
present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right
transjugular right ventricular temporary pacer lead follows the
expected course to the floor of the right ventricle.  There is
no mediastinal widening.
 - CT HEAD: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
 - CT C-Spine: No cervical spinal fractures.  Mild degenerative
anterolisthesis at C3/4 and C5/6 as well as mild posterior
degenerative spondylolisthesis at C6/7. Prominence of the
pulmonary vessels and thickening of the inter- and intra-lobular
septa consistent with pulmonary edema.
 - CT Angio Chest:
1.  No evidence of aortic dissection.
2.  Dense atherosclerosis involving the coronary arteries,
mitral valve, thoracic and abdominal aorta, and proximal
mesenteric branches.  Severe stenosis of the celiac artery at
its origin. Moderate stenosis of the SMA at its origin.
3.  Loss of height of L1 and T9 - age indeterminate.
4.  5-mm nodule in the left upper lobe.  Followup in six months'
time is recommended to document stability.
 - ECHO: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic function. Bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis with high transvalvular gradients and mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral stenosis, likely secondary to
extensive mitral annular calcification. Mild-to-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is an 86 y/o F w/ h/o HTN, CAD, [**Month/Day (1) 1291**], p/w syncope,
found to have complete heart block. She had a pacemaker placed,
complicated by a post-placement hematoma which was evacuated.
.
# Cardiac:
a) Rhythm: Ms [**Known lastname 71073**] presented with  complete heart block,
likely [**2-21**] worsening of long-documented conduction disease (RBBB
and L post-hemiblock).  She had reverted to sinus rhythm with
prolonged AV conduction by [**Hospital1 18**] presentation; a temporary
pacing wire was placed and she was eventually taken to the EP
lab for permanent pacemaker.  This procedure was complicated by
a large hematoma (requiring 9 U pRBCs) which was also associated
with hypotension requiring dopamine.  She was sent to the CCU
for monitoring; her anticoagulation was not reversed secondary
to her mechanical AV valve.  She was intubated and taken to the
EP lab on [**2-7**] for hematoma evacuation. She improved and was
taken to the floor on [**2-11**] for further cares.
.
b) Ischemia: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 71074**] is s/p old IMI. She is currently on
statin therapy. Her aspirin was held throughout her hospital
stay given her persistent risk of bleeding. It may need to be
restarted as an outpatient, after documentation of stable hct.

c) Pump: She has a [**Hospital3 9642**] [**Hospital3 1291**] and Diastolic CHF with
pulmonary edema s/p intra-op fluid recussiation. EF 75%. She was
maintained on amlodipine and metoprolol. Her INR goal of [**2-22**] was
maintained with coumadin after heparin bridging.

d) St Jude's valve: Goal INR [**2-22**]. Maintained on coumadin.

#) Fever. Ms. [**Known lastname 71073**] had intermittent fever during her stay.
She was given a course of vancomycin to cover concern for
hematoma abscess. She was also treated with cipro for a UTI. Her
fevers resolved prior to discharge.

#) Hematoma. A large hematoma post-operatively required 9 Units
pRBCs and operative evacuation on [**2-7**] with resulting hct
stabilization. Retention sutures were placed. She received a six
day course of antibiotics and her arm was kept in a sling for
one week. Her wound was followed by the surgery wound care RN.

#) Anemia. GI was consulted for anemia on admission. They have
recommended iron supplementation and colonoscopy as an
outpatient.

#) HTN. She has chronic HTN and was maintained on lisinopril as
discussed above.

#) DM2. Ms. [**Known lastname 71075**] blood sugars remained in control on
standing lantus and sliding scale insulin. She will be returned
to her oral medications on discharge.

#) Hypothyroid. Maintained on levothyroxine.

#) Dementia/Social: Pt is moderately demented, and we continued
lexapro and risperdal. Her baseline status does not suggest
capability for safe functioning at home at this time and a rehab
screen was initiated with the help of occupational and physical
therapy.

#) Dispo: She was screened for rehab and discharged to

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a cardiac condition known
as complete heart block. This condition necessitated the
placement of a device called a pacemaker to regulate your
heartbeat.

You were also treated for an exacerbation of congestive heart
failure (CHF) and had a wound hematoma evacuation that will
continue to require daily dressing changes.

You should maintain a low sodium, heart healthy di
