Brief Hospital Course:
Pt completed course of antibiotics. ARF resolved. Anasarca was
treated with diuresis. Pt improved clinically, however was
markedly delerious. This was felt to be multifactorial due to
narcotics and sedating meds. These were decreased with
improvement to mental status back to baseline. Pt developed
sacral decubitus during admission. She also had a PICC line in
the RUE which developed skin breakdown. Both of these were
addressed with the wound care team.
