L foot biopsy from surgery demonstrates few polys and few gram
positive cocci: prelim proteus mirabilis, diphtheroids,
enterococcus, w/ proteus sensis in chart

Micro:  none

Images:
OSH CXR ([**2-4**]): lungs and pleura clear, cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal. no bony abnl seen.

CTPA ([**2-4**]): Multiple pulmonary emboli including a saddle
embolus. Pulmonary emboli involve both the L and R pulmonary
arteries as well as all lobar and most segmental branches.  The
thoracic aorta is normal.  The heart is normal.  The lungs are
clear.  There is no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.

EKG:
([**2116-3-6**]):Normal sinus rhythm. Normal ECG

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2117-2-5**] 11:13 AM
FINDINGS: Bilateral lower extremity venous duplex.
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:
The common femoral and proximal femoral shows normal flow and
compression.
The mid and distal femoral vein, the popliteal vein and the
posterior tibial veins show no flow and no compression.
The peroneal veins could not be seen.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY:
The common femoral vein and proximal femoral vein shows normal
flow and
compression.
Mid and distal femoral vein show partial compression and
intermittent flow
within them.
The popliteal, the posterior tibial and peroneal veins show
normal flow and compression.
IMPRESSION:
1. DVT of the right mid-to-distal femoral vein, popliteal and
PTV.
2. Partial thrombosis of the left mid and distal femoral vein.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2117-2-6**] at 1:45:05 PM
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis
and preservation of apical function ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There
is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary
artery hypertension.

CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2115-2-6**]:35 a.m.
Tip of the new left brachial PICC line is in the lower third of
the SVC.
Heart size top normal. Lungs clear

Repeat ECHO:
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Preserved left
ventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 54F h/o Beh??????et, transferred from outside
hospital with dyspnea and e/o bilateral PEs, including saddle
embolus.

# Acute PE:
Patient has had shortness of breath for approximately 3 weeks.
It is likely that pt had some PE at that point, which grew or
were exacerbated by surgery and further immobilization on
Monday. Pt w/ surgery on Monday [**2-1**].  Worsening shortness of
breath since then.  At OSH, CTA demonstrated extensive bilateral
pulmonary emboli, w/ e/o saddle embolism.  PE most likely
secondary to immobility, as patient has been in rehab for
months. No family hx of DVT/PE, clotting disorders or
malignancy.  Patient apparently had a DVT after fracturing foot
years ago. Patient is obese.  Patient is transferred on heparin
drip.  Patient has never been tested for anti-phospholipid
syndrome. Per hx, pt has lupus, which also may contribute to a
pro-thrombotic picture. Patient's systolic pressures were
occasionally low to the 80 range although responsive to fluid
boluses (500 cc at a time of LR increasing pressures to the
120s).  Echo did demonstrate right heart strain and pulmonary
hypertension.  Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound did
demonstrate bilateral DVTs and the interventional radiology team
placed an IVC filter [
