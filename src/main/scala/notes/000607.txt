HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2157-4-28**] for cardiac
catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization showed left
ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 50%, 70% to
80% LAD lesion, 80% LCX lesion, 70% OM2 lesion, 90% RCA
lesion.  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on
[**2157-4-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a coronary artery bypass
graft x3, left internal mammary artery to ramus, saphenous
vein graft to PDA, saphenous vein graft to PL.  Please see
operative note for further details.  The patient as
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on nitroglycerin,
milrinone and liquefied infusions.  On the evening of
postoperative day 0, the patient was noted to have a
significant respiratory acidosis.  Chest x-ray revealed a
left upper lobe collapse.  The patient underwent bronchoscopy
which revealed a left upper lobe mucous plug which was
removed.  Post bronchoscopy chest x-ray revealed mild
improvement in the aeration of the left upper lobe.  The
patient initially had a low cardiac index which responded to
volume resuscitation and increasing the milrinone infusion.

On postoperative day #1, the patient underwent repeat
bronchoscopy which showed mild bilateral tracheobronchitis
and again a mucous plug in the left upper lobe which was
removed.  The patient was continued on a propofol infusion
through the first postoperative day due to patient tenuous
respiratory status.  On postoperative day #2, the patient's
propofol was weaned to off at which time the Levophed
infusion was discontinued as patient's blood pressure
increased and the patient was subsequently placed on
nitroprusside infusion to maintain her systolic blood
pressure less than 130.  The patient was noted to have a
cough and gag with suctioning.  The patient was noted to move
head with noxious stimuli and pupils were 3 cm equal and
reactive to light, but it was noted that there was no
movement of arms or legs.

On postoperative day #3, the milrinone was weaned to off with
a continued adequate cardiac output and index.  The patient
continued on nitroprusside infusion for blood pressure
control.  The patient had been started back on Plavix for her
previous carotid endarterectomies and patient had improving
respiratory status and was able to decrease the ventilatory
support, however the patient continued to have decreased
neurologic function and a neurology consult was obtained and
a head CT scan was obtained.  CT scan of the head showed a
ACA hypodensity bilateral watershed hypodensity extending
posteriorly on the left and an old cerebellar stroke.  Her
neurologic exam on postoperative day #3 was no spontaneous
eye opening, however opened eyes to noxious stimuli.  The
patient had positive corneal reflex, positive gag reflex,
withdrew all limbs weakly to noxious stimuli.  Neurology felt
that it was unclear whether or not that patient's status was
due to her preoperative neurologic findings or a new
neurologic event and requested an EEG to rule out subclinical
seizure activity.

On postoperative day #4, the patient underwent EEG study
which showed no epileptic features, generalized swelling with
suggestion of encephalopathic condition.  On neurologic exam,
it was noted that the patient had bilateral Babinski sign.
The patient was started on enteral nutrition on postoperative
day #4.  The patient had a sputum culture sent for increasing
tracheal secretions which subsequently are positive for
Haemophilus influenza and Pseudomonas.  The patient was
started on levofloxacin and ceftazidine for double coverage
of the Pseudomonas.  On postoperative day #4, the patient was
started on Lopressor for control of hypertension, as well as
placed on Isordil.  The patient's neurologic status slowly
progressed on postoperative day #6.  Patient opened eyes to
voice, but did not track.

On postoperative day #9, it was noted that the patient stuck
out her tongue to command and was able to track movement with
her eyes.  It was felt by the neurology service that due to
the patient's early improvement in the first week,
substantial recovery over the next few weeks to months was
possible and it was decided that the patient would undergo
tracheostomy and PEG placement and would be evaluated for
neurologic rehabilitation.  On [**2157-5-9**], the patient
underwent placement of tracheostomy percutaneously by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**].  A 7.0 Portex as well as a PEG placement.  After the
tracheostomy placement, the patient as noted on chest x-ray
to again have a whiteout of the left side and underwent
bronchoscopy for large amounts of bloody secretions.
Subsequent chest x-ray was improved.

On postoperative day #11, the patient underwent a psychiatry
consultation.  As the patient has a history of anxiety, it
was thought that the patient has a combination of delirium
and dementia complicated by encephalopathy and it was
recommended to continue the present management.  The patient
underwent repeat bronchoscopy on postoperative day #11 which
showed relatively clear airways, clear secretions, no plugs
in the left upper lobe.

On postoperative day #12, the patient was tracking with her
eyes, inconsistently following commands, non purposeful upper
body movement.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable
and weaning on the ventilator.  On postoperative day #12,
neurology evaluated the patient and felt that she would
continue to improve over the next several weeks and
recommended once the patient was in a rehabilitation facility
she could benefit from a dopamine agonist such as
bromocriptine 2.5 mg q day and slowly titrate over several
weeks to about 20 mg per day.  The patient's ventilator had
been weaned down to pressure support ventilation which she
has tolerated well.

On [**5-16**], postoperative day #17, the patient was accepted at a
rehabilitation facility and was clear for discha
