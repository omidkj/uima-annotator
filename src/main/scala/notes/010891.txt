History of Present Illness:
HPI:
Ms [**Known lastname 8271**] is a 54 yo female with hx of COPD, htn, and chronic
pain who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] today with acute dyspnea in
the setting of runing out of her inhalers.
.
She has felt worsening dypsnea since Saturday, but her dyspnea
acutely worsened yesterday.  She also reports that for the last
two days she has had nausea and has vomiting several times dark
black material.  She denies blood in her stool or dark stool,
but has been having diarrhea.  She also admits to fever and
sweats since yesterday.
.
At [**Hospital1 **] Neehdam she was found to be tachycardic to the 130s and
hypoxic in the low 90's on RA.  She was given IVF and
levofloxacin (CXR was reportedly normal, but she reported fever
and had a WBC).  EKG was without ischemic changes.  Labs
revealed a cr of 1.2 and trop of 0.115 so she was given ASA and
started on a heparin gtt with a bolus and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for cardiology evaluation.  She was reportedly guaiac
negative on exam.  She was also given nebs.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 98.1  HR 92  BP 116/70  RR 16  SAt 100%
on 2LNC.  On arrival to our ED she reported that her dyspnea had
resolved.  She was initially continued on the heparin gtt which
was later stopped when she reported hematemesis and her Hct came
back at 24.6 (when it had been 33.5 at BINeeham).  EKG again
showed no ischemic changes.  Besides the hematemesis for the
last two days she also admitted to melena and had guaiac
positive melanotic stools on exam in our ED.  She was started on
a protonix gtt with 80 mg IV boluses and given 5 mg diazepam, 4
mg morphine x 2, and 4 mg zofran.  She was also ordered for 2
units PRBC (but had not received them yet).  She refused NG
lavage.  GI was consulted and recommended medically stabilizing
overnight with plan for an EGD in the morning.  She was
transferred up to the floor with 2 PIV.
.
Currently she has had no further episodes of hematemesis.
.
On ROS she admits to recent URI symptoms, headache, and
dizziness.  She denies abdominal pain or chest pain.  She also
has had her chronic back pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo female with COPD, htn, and chronic pain who presented to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] today with a COPD exacerbation complicated by demand
ischemia, additionally with an upper GI bleed.
.
# UGIB, acute blood loss anemia:  The patient has a baseline Hct
in the low 40's.  Hct on presentation to the OSH was 33 and
dropped to 25 here in the setting of IVF.  She reported
hematemesis and had melena on rectal exam here consistent with
an upper GI bleed.  She had been taking celebrex [**Hospital1 **] recently.
No further episodes of vomiting in house.  Patient
hemodynamically stable.  She received a total of 4 units of
blood while in-house with stabilization of her Hct at 31.  She
underwent an EGD with MAC on [**2-25**] which demonstrated PUD and
gastritis.  She is advised to avoid all ASA, NSAIDs, and
celebrex.  She was maintained on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] and her diet was
advanced as tolerated.  An H pylori was sent and PENDING upon
discharge.  She will need a repeat EGD in [**7-13**] weeks.
.
# Demand ischemia:  Patient asymptomatic with no ischemic
changes on EKG, but sustained a significant troponin leak,
secondary to demand ischemia from anemia.  Given absence of
symptoms, she likely would not benefit from a stress.  ASA is
contraindicated at this point.
.
# CPD exacerbation:  The patient presented with acute dyspnea
after running out of her inhalers at home.  She received neb
treatments in the OSH ED with improvement in her acute dyspnea.
CXR showed no PNA, however she was with wheezing consistent with
a COPD exacerbation.  She was treated with nebulizers,
hydrocortisone, and azithromycin with stabilization of
respiratory status. She was changed to oral prednisone for 3
more days to complete a 5-day course, once her Hct was
stabilized and she was taking po's.
.
#  Hypertension:  Stable, home lisinopril and hctz were held in
the setting of GI bleed, but restarted the day prior to
discharge.
.
#  Chronic fatigue syndrome/fibromyalgia/TMJ:  Patient is on a
narcotics contract as an outpatient and her home regimen was
restarted once she was tolerating po's.
