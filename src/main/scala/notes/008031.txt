with hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary
artery disease who presented with an episode of
unresponsiveness.  The patient has been living in a
rehabilitation facility after undergoing a cardiac procedure
Women's Hospital.  Over the past few days, she had had fecal
impaction and while attempting to strain on the toilet, she
became diaphoretic, pale and unresponsive for 15 minutes.
She was taken to [**Hospital3 3834**] where she was reported to
be awake, answering questions.  Blood pressure was 180/80.
CT of the head showed a left thalamic bleed.  After transfer
to the Intensive Care Unit, she was reported to be
appropriately.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] on a Nipride drip.

Further history elicited that since [**Month (only) 404**] she has fallen
several times, but the cause has not been determined.  She
had been using a cane.  At the rehabilitation facility, she
had been treated for Clostridium difficile and pneumonia and
was scheduled to be transferred home.

2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on anticoagulation,
underwent ablation procedure at [**Hospital6 1708**]

3.  Hypertension.  Systolic blood pressures have been in the
ranges of 150 to 200.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  The patient was awake, alert and oriented
to self only.  She could not say the month when asked, but
did say it was summer.  She did not know the year.  On months
of the year forward, she says that she went on a trip in
[**Month (only) 404**] and [**Month (only) 956**].  On redirection, she says [**Month (only) 404**], but
then shifts to a birthday party that she attended.  She could
not carry out a coherent stream of though.  She named
correctly high frequency objects, but had an anomia of low
frequency objects.  She followed simple commands.  Speech was
fluent, repetition intact.  On cranial nerve testing, optic
discs were normal.  Pupils equal and reactive to light.
Limited up gaze.  Visual fields full to confrontation, V1 to
V3 intact to light touch and to pinprick.  Face, tongue,
palate move symmetrically.  Hearing intact to
finger rub bilaterally.  She had lingual dyskinesias, not
orobucal.  MOTOR EXAMINATION:  Pronator drift of the right
arm.  She has a mild weakness of the right arm and leg and an
upper motor neuron distribution.  Sensory examination to
light touch was intact, reported feeling the pin in all
extremities equally.  REFLEXES:  She had +1 reflexes
throughout at the ankles.  She had no reflexes.  She had an
upgoing toe on the right on plantar responses.  COORDINATION
TESTING:  Finger to nose finger and heel to shin were normal.
Gait was deferred.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  Sodium was initially 128, repeat
133, potassium 4.8, chloride 91, bicarbonate 32, BUN 20,
creatinine 0.6, glucose 137, albumin 3.2, SGOT 10, SGPT 25,
CK 9, troponin 0.4, calcium 8.8, white blood cell 8.4,
hematocrit 34, platelets 129.  Urinalysis showed moderate
yeast, 0 to 2 red blood cells, packed white blood cells, 10
to 20 epithelial cells, 1+ leukocyte esterase.  A head CT
from an outside hospital showed that she had left sided
thalamic bleed with some interventricular extension 6 cc in
volume, no edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was an 84-year-old woman with coronary
artery disease, atrial fibrillation and hypertension who
preoperative diagnosis with transient unresponsiveness in the
setting of abdominal stranding.  The stranding together with
hypertension were the two most likely etiologies to account
for the thalamic bleed.  She appeared to be in a confusional
state and the mild right sided weakness suggested possible
edema compressing the internal capsule.  She initially
was placed in the Intensive Care Unit where her blood
pressures was controlled in the range of 130 to 160
(systolic) using Nipride drip.  Her blood pressures were
stable in this range and she was switched to her outpatient
medications, including her beta blocker and Isordil.  Her
aspirin was of course discontinued.

The patient was transferred to the floor the following day.
She had an occasional systolic blood pressure which rose up
to the 180s and therefore hydralazine was added to her
antihypertensive regimen and her Lopressor had been increased
to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Her mental state slowly cleared.  By the day
of discharge, her mental state had returned to baseline.

The patient was discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hydralazine 10 mg q6h
2.  Lopressor 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
3.  Isordil 20 mg [**Hospital1 **]
4.  Ventolin and AeroBid for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease
5.  Calcium and vitamin D for osteoporosis, as well as
Miacalcin

The patient will follow up with her primary care physician
and they have been encouraged to follow up in the neurology
clinic.  The telephone number for the neurology clinic has
been given to the family.
