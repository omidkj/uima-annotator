Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1728**] is an 86M with cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20%), CAD s/p
PCI's x 3, mod-severe AS, prior MVR, and atrial flutter who
presents with acute on chronic renal failure on outpatient
follow up. He was recently admitted to hospital for increased
fatigue and diarrhea and discharged on [**2166-12-14**]. This
hospitalization was complicated by hypotension requiring fluid
resuscitation in the MICU. He was discharged home on torsemide
20 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was an increase from previous home regimen of
lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **]. He presented to his cardiologist's office for
routine labs. His creatinine increased to 4.5 with increased
lower extremity edema.
.
In the ED, VS were stable. EKG showed RBBB with no acute
changes. His creatinine increased from 2.9 on [**2166-12-14**] to 4.9.
Patient denied dietary indiscretions. He was started on a new
medication, minocycline prior to having his labs drawn for a
pruritic rash on his torso. Other relatively new medications
include coumadin for his atrial flutter.
.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service where his ACE was held given
renal failure. He was started on hydral for afterload reduction
and lasix gtt for diuresis. He is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] who
recommended milrinone + lasix gtt for treatment of his
decompensated end stage CHF. He was transferred to the CCU for
further management.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. He admits to significant chronic lower extremity
edema.

TTE [**2166-12-9**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20% %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate
([**1-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral
valve prosthesis is present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve leaflets
are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2166-12-18**] CXR: Mild pulmonary edema, with no focal consolidation.
.
TTE [**2166-12-20**]
There appears to be a mass in the body of the left atrium. It
appears to be attached to the posterior wall. This may be a
tumour, thrombus or an artifact from the prosthetic mitral
valve. It has been present, with a similar size on
echocardiograms on [**4-22**]/8 and 11/18/8. It was also seen on a
cardiac MRIon [**2165-10-15**]. A TEE could be done to further clarify,
if indicated. Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
global hypokinesis. Moderate to severe aortic stenosis and mild
to moderate aortic regurgitation. Normally functioning mitral
prosthesis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC CHF
This is due to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15-20%.
BNP was elevated on admission.  He was initially put on a Lasix
drip on the floor but was minimally responsive.  He was then
sent to the CCU on [**2166-12-19**] and was started on Milrinone.  He
was given a 25 mcg/kg Milrinone bolus and then put on 0.25
mcg/kg/min Milrinone drip on [**2166-12-19**].  This was increased to
0.375 on [**2166-12-20**] and to 0.5 mcg/kg/min on [**2166-12-21**].  He was
kept on a Lasix drip at 12mg/min.  Due to low blood pressure he
was started on phenylephrine which ranged from 0.5-1.0
mcg/kg/min to maintain his BP with MAPs in the 50s. He diuresed
well and was negative 9.5L for his length of stay, averaging
between 2-3L per day.  His metoprolol was titrated up to improve
diastolic filling time.  His echo on [**2166-11-19**] showed improvement
of his stroke volume and cardiac output.  His renal function
improved with creatinine of 4.9 on admission and 2.3 on
discharge.  The milrinone and lasix were weaned off on [**2166-12-23**].
He required phenylephrine for BP support until [**2166-12-24**], when
this was weaned off.  He was kept on a low sodium diet and was
fluid restricted.  On [**2166-12-23**] he was started on Bumex 3mg PO
BID.  He continued to diurese with this regimen.  His Lisinopril
was stopped on admission and remained off due to acute renal
failure.  He improved clinically and was discharged on [**2166-12-25**]
with outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISASE
The patient had a history of coronary disease and had ST
depressions in leads I and AVL on admission.  He had no
complaints of chest pain or SOB and these depressions were
unchanged on follow-up ECGs.  His CKs were flat and tr
