Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis and vt

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement

History of Present Illness:
 Pt is a 78y/o AM w/ a PMH significant for CAD s/p LAD stent x2,
HTN, Afib, and CRI who presented with hypotension, a RBBB, and
PNA.  He was in his USOH until [**11-19**] when he noted fevers and
dizziness.  He went to a OSH and was found to have PNA.  He
experienced 2 runs of VT, was started on lidocaine and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he was found to be hypotensive to the 70s with a
lactate of 4.5.  He was started on sepsis protocol and sent to
the MICU for pressor support.  In the MICU, he was hypotensive
requiring levophed, hypoxic requiring BiPAP, and w/
leukocytosis.  He was changed from ceftriaxone/azithromycin to
zosyn/vancomycin and then his vanco was stopped after outside
BCx grew klebsiella.  He was continued on IVF and endocrine was
consulted for hypothyroidism.  As he was treated w/ abx he was
able to be weaned from both the lidocaine and levophed and
actually required BP control w/ metoprolol prior to call-out.
At the time of x-fer he has no complaints.  He denies SOB, CP,
abdominal pain, N/V, HA, or other complaints.  He has been
afebrile since 6pm on [**11-22**] and his bcx/ucx have been negative to
date here at [**Hospital1 18**].

Pertinent Results:
Cath [**4-24**]:
1. Single-vessel coronary artery disease.
2. In-stent restenosis of the proximal LAD stent.
3. Moderate systolic hypertension.
4. Successful drug-eluting stenting of proximal LAD.
.
CXR [**2151-11-22**]: There is a left-sided IJ central venous catheter
with the distal tip in the brachiocephalic vein.  The cardiac
size is unchanged.  The lateral radiograph is suboptimal.  There
is a pleural effusion, likely on the left side given the
retrocardiac opacity.  Underlying infiltrate in the left base
would be difficult to exclude.  Degenerative changes are seen at
the dorsal spine.
Interstitial markings are mildly prominent without overt
pulmonary edema.
.
ECHO [**2151-11-23**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular  cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal  (LVEF=55%). Apical
hypokinesis is present.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic  valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of  [**2148-10-30**], the apical hypokinesis may be new, since
the apex was not well seen on the previous study.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78y/o man w/ a PMH significant for CAD, HTN, afib, and CRI
who presented w/ VT and presumed sepsis.  He initially required
pressor support but has improved from a hemodynamic perspective
and was called out to the floor
.
1. Sepsis: The pt originally presented w/ hypotension, PNA on
CXR, a lactate of nearly 5 and + OSH klebsiella BCx. He required
pressor support and was treated, in turn, with
ceftriaxone/azithromycin, vanco/zosyn, and finally zosyn alone
as his OSH cultures grew pan-sensitive klebsiella in [**2-22**] bottles
(SENSITIVE: amikacin, amp/sulbactam, cefaxolin, ceftaz,
ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cipro, gent, imi, levo, pip/tazo, tobra
RESISTANT: Ampicillin).  He required IVF to maintain his
pressure along w/ levophed when first admitted to the unit but
was weaned off these prior to call out to the floor.  Once he
came to the floor, he spiked temperatures to 101 on 2
consecutive days but these abated once his central line was d/c.
 His antibiotics were switched to levaquin and he will complete
a 14d course at home.  The blood and urine cultures drawn here
at [**Hospital1 18**] have yet to grow any bacteria and the patient is no
longer requiring supplemental oxygen or IVF.
.
2. Rhythm: Pt had two episodes of VT at OSH and requiring
lidocaine gtt.  This therapy was continued in the MICU but was
weaned prior to call out to the floor.  He developed a rate
dependent RBBB during his MICU course but this corrected with
better rate control.  The patient has chronic afib as an
outpatient and had this on admission but was converted to NSR
with amiodarone.  He has never been anticoagulated for his afib
and his PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] about this and agreed to f/u with him
as an outpatient.
.
3. CAD: The pt was r/o for MI this admission.  He was continued
on his bblocker, aspirin, and statin.  He was restarted on his
ace-i after he recovered his renal function and was normotensive
(130/60 on the day of d/c) only on captopril 6.25 tid.  He was
sent out on lisinopril 5mg qd (was on 40 on admission) and will
require BP titration as an outpatient if he again becomes
hypertensive.
.
5. Acute on Chronic RF: His baseline Cr appears to be 1.6-1.9
over the past few years but was elevated to 3.0 on admission.
This was attributed to a prerenal etiology [**12-23**] his septic
picture and his renal function recovered with fluid rehydration.

.
6. Endo: The patient had a significantly decreased TSH on MICU
admission along with an elevated free t4 and a low t3.
Endocrine was consulted and felt that there was no need to treat
him actuely for this problem but [**Name2 (NI) 33857**] outpatient
follow-up of his TFTs.
