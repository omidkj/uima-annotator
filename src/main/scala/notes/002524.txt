Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for ST elevation MI.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
85-year-old female transferred from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital after
originally being admitted there on [**2179-5-13**] for
treatment of right foot fracture and left ankle sprain which
she sustained during a fall at home.  The patient was in the
rehabilitation unit of the hospital today when she had a
syncopal episode while using the commode after a brief loss
of consciousness.  An EKG was done and the patient was found
to be bradycardiac with 5 mm ST segment elevations in V3
through V6, II, III, and aVF.  The patient also complained of
chest pressure and had an episode of emesis.  The episode
occurred at 10:20 a.m.

The patient was started on heparin and was administered
Retavase.  The patient was also given aspirin, Percocet, and
IV nitroglycerin.  Her chest pressure resolved on
presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]; however, the patient continued to
complain of dyspnea and diaphoresis.  She also reported
additional nausea but had no emesis since the morning.  The
patient cites no history of bleeding disorders.  She had an
EGD two years ago which revealed mild gastritis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroidism.
2.  Multiple bilateral rotator cuff surgeries.
3.  Total abdominal hysterectomy.
4.  Right foot fracture on [**2179-5-13**].

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Synthroid 50 micrograms p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Darvocet.
2.  Restoril 50 mg h.s. p.r.n.
3.  Synthroid 50 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to iodine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied the use of tobacco,
alcohol, or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.9, blood pressure 116/58, heart rate 73, respiratory rate
20, 02 saturation 95% on room air.  General: The patient was
mildly uncomfortable, in no acute respiratory distress, lying
flat in bed.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes moist.  Oropharynx
clear.  The pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
Neck:  No JVD, supple.  Chest:  Fine crackles at the bases
bilaterally.  No wheezes.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm,
II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.  No S3 or S4.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Bilateral feet and ankles wrapped in bandages.
Ecchymoses present on the lower extremities.  Neurologic:
Alert and oriented times three.  Examination otherwise
nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  CK 43, troponin
less than 0.01.  Hematocrit 41.

The initial EKG at the outside hospital showed 5 mm ST
segment elevations in V3 through V6, 2 mm ST segment
elevation in II, III, and aVF.  Prior to lysis, EKG disclosed
2 mm ST segment elevation in V3 through V6, 1 mm ST segment
elevation in II, III, and aVF.  Following the administration
of thrombolytic agents, the patient had 1 mm ST segment
elevation in II, III, aVF, V3 through V6.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 85-year-old female with ST elevation
MI, status post lytic therapy with continued symptoms of
chest pain.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization and transferred to the CCU for further
management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A.  CAD:  The patient
was taken to the Cath Lab for cardiac catheterization.
Coronary angiography of the right dominant circulation
revealed no significant residual coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was short and had no significant stenosis.  The LAD
had no significant narrowing but flow down the arteries
seemed to pause in the midvessel.  The LAD supplied a single
bifurcating V1 that had no significant disease.  The left
circumflex was free of significant disease and gave rise to a
moderate sized OM1 and a large OM2 before terminating in the
AV groove.  The RCA had mild luminal irregularities and
supplied small PDA and PLV branches.

Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left
ventricular filling pressure with an LVEDP of 22 mmHg in the
setting of normal systemic arterial blood pressure.  There
was evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension with PA
pressures of 43/13/26 mmHg.  The cardiac output was preserved
at 5.1 liters per minute.  No significant gradient across the
aortic valve was detected.

Left ventriculography demonstrated anterolateral, apical, and
inferior apical akinesis with a calculated left ventricular
ejection fraction of 53% but a visually observed left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, severe 3+ mitral
regurgitation was seen.

The patient returned to the CCU for further observation.  She
was administered aspirin, heparin, and beta blocker.  Her
cardiac enzymes were cycled and CKs peaked around 300.  Lipid
profile split disclosed an HDL of 66, LDL of 113.  Since the
patient did not have any demonstrable CAD, she was not
started on a statin.  ACE inhibitor was initiated when the
patient's blood pressure could tolerate this.

B.  PUMP:  The patient underwent an echocardiogram on [**2179-5-17**].  Echocardiogram disclosed resting regional wall
motion abnormalities including akinesis of the lower half of
the LV with a dyskinetic apex.  There was a moderate resting
left ventricular outflow tract gradient observed.  There was
no LV apical thrombus.  There was moderate to moderately
severe mitral regurgitation ([**3-15**]+).  The patient ejection
fraction was 25%.

As mentioned above, the patient was started on a beta blocker
and ACE inhibitors.

C.  RHYTHM:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm
during her hospital stay.

D.  ANTICOAGULATION:  Due to the patient's poor ejection
fraction and apical akinesis, it was decided that the patient
should be started on Coumadin.  The patient's goal INR is
[**3-15**].

2.  HEMATOLOGIC:  On [**2179-5-17**], it was noted that the
patient's hematocrit dropped to 27.3.  A CT scan of the
abdomen did not disclose evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
A right groin ultrasound did not show evidence of hematoma.
There was, however, a small AV fistula observed.  The patient
was given a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells during
her hospital stay.

3.  VASCULAR:  As noted above, the right groin ultrasound
disclosed a small AV fistula.  There was no evidence of
hematoma or pseudoaneurysm.  A Vascular Surgery consult was
obtained.  The vascular surgeons noted that the patient had
excellent distal flow with good dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses.  There was no indication for operative
intervention.  The patient will undergo follow-up right groin
ultrasound in six weeks.

4.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  As noted above, the patient had been
admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital due to right third metatarsal
fracture.  An Orthopedics consult was obtained for evaluation
of the patient's fracture.  It was recommended that the
patient wear a cast shoe on her right foot for comfort and
support.  She may weightbear as tolerated.  In addition, the
patient was noted to have a left ankle sprain.  She was given
an air cast for her left foot.  The patient was instructed to
rest, elevate, and weightbear with this foot as tolerated.
The patient may walk with assistance.  She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] from Orthopedic Surgery in two weeks.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was maintained on a Heart Healthy
Diet during her hospital stay.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient continued on levothyroxine 50 mg
p.o. q.d.

7.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was maintained on a bowel
regimen during her hospital stay.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Levothyroxine 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.

Orthopedic Surgery in one to two weeks, phone number is
