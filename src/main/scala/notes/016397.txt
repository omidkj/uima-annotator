chemotherapy per his oncologist, the patient presented for a
left nephroureterectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 24219**] urology service after
undergoing left open nephroureterectomy on [**2159-5-3**].  Please see
the dictated operative note for details.  Immediately
post-operatively, he was hypertensive in the PACU requiring
doses of labetalol (patient has significant hypertension at
baseline).  Because of significant fluid and blood
administration (3u pRBCs) intraoperatively, 10 mg of IV
furosemide were also administered.  His blood pressure was
adequately controlled on prn IV hydralazine as well as IV
lopressor.  He progressed slowly with his post-operative course
- his pain was initially controlled on a combination of a
dilaudid PCA and a Bupivicaine PCEA.

Of note, on POD 1, he had an acute hypotensive episode resulting
in a call for code blue.  He was found unresponsive sitting in
the chair and was moved quickly to the bed, after which his
systolic blood pressure was noted to be <70 mmHg.  He was also
noted to have dysarthria and decreased movement in his right
arm.  This defect was transient, and resolved after laying the
patient down in bed and administering fluid, which slightly
improved his systolic blood pressure.  Nevertheless, the patient
was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.  Upon arrival
to the ICU, he was hemodynamically stable and awake/oriented.  A
head CT was performed, which was negative for acute intracranial
hemorrhage.  The patient was also evaluated by Neurology.  He
did have some episodes of transient delirium while in the ICU,
which resolved after being transferred to the floor on POD 3.
While in the ICU, a chest Xray was performed which showed
opacification of the R lower and middle lobes suspicious for
pneumonia.  He was started empirically on a seven-day course of
levofloxacin.

During his hospitalization, he was also evaluated by the renal
service for severe hypertension with SBP > 180.  His amlodipine
was increased to 10 mg daily, and his hypertension was improved
after he underwent auto-diuresis of the fluid resusication that
he received immediately postoperatively.  On POD 3, some
erythema was noted around his L flank incision and IV vancomycin
was started.  This was D/C'ed before discharge, as the erythema
was completely resolved and the patient remained on
levofloxacin.

As his discharge neared, the patient was evaluated by physical
therapy and was deemed a good rehabilitation candidate.  His
nasal cannula oxygen was weaned to off before discharge with
ambulation and chest physiotherapy.  He was discharged
ambulating, with his pain adequately controlled on PO pain meds,
tolerating a regular diet, and with his foley catheter draining
well.  He was given explicit instructions to call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the
day after discharge to arrange for a follow-up appointment
within one week for staple and foley catheter removal.  The
rehab facility was also given instructions not to remove his
foley catheter until his follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
