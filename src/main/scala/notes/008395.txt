.
CXR [**2200-4-21**]: Note is made of paucity of the vessels in upper
lobes, representing severe emphysema. Again note is made of
faint opacity in lower lobe, which may represent early pneumonia
if the patient has fever, however, the finding is equivocal.
Again note is made of right basilar atelectasis and blunting of
the right costophrenic angle, unchanged compared to the prior
study. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Severe emphysema. Faint opacity in left lower lobe,
which may represent early pneumonia if the patient has fever.
Please correlate clinically, and if necessary, please repeat PA
and lateral chest radiograph.
.
CXR [**4-22**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to chest imaging study since
[**2199-9-9**], most recently [**4-21**]:
Bullous emphysema is severe. There is no substantial atelectasis
or evidence of pneumonia. Minimal interstitial abnormality in
the lingula may be chronic, since it is less severe than the
appearance on [**2199-11-7**] when the patient was in mild
congestive heart failure. Heart is normal size. There is no
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48M w/ severe COPD on home O2, type 2dm, now being admitted
for COPD exacerbation.
.
1. COPD exercabtion: The patient was admitted to ICU for close
monitoring. CXR did not reveal any pneumonia and the patient
remained afebrile and no leukocytosis in the ICU and on the
floor.  In ICU, the patient was continued on azithromycin, iv
steroids, aggressive nebulizer treatment as well as Spiriva,
Advair, Flonase, [**Doctor First Name **], and Afrin. The patient was transferred

patient was switched to po prednisone and continued all other
medications.  The patient's pulmonary status gradually improved.
 The patient finished 5 day course of azithromycin and is to
finish 2 week prednisone taper and continue maintenance
prednisone 10mg every other day until he follows up with his
pulmonologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 56979**].  The patient is to receive
outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation/physical therapy.  Smoking
cessation counseling was given.  At the time of discharge, pt's
ambulatory sat was 97% on 4L (ambulatory sat baseline at 95% on
4L NC) and satting 95-100% on 2L at rest, which is his basline.

.
2. Tachycardia: Was secondary to respiratory distress and
continous nebs. Tachycardia improved with less frequent
albuterol nebs.
.
3. DM: Held oral hypoglycemics while npo and restarted once good
PO intake.
.
4. Depression: continued Lexapro and Bupropion.
