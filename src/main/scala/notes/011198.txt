Abdominal surgery for abdominal compartment syndrome

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 40 yo gentleman presented to [**Hospital3 635**] hospital
yesterday with diarrhea x2 days, transferred for worsening
sepsis.  Pt told OSH that he ate shelfish including lobster,
clams and raw oysters on Saturday and the following day
developed diarrhea.  On Monday he develloped n/v and diarrhea
became bloody and he also developed diffuse abd pain, diffuse
body aches and low grade tems.

At the OSH, pt was hypotensive to the 70s on arrival.  Labs were
notable for hematocrit fo 67, WBC of 3.8, transaminitis with AST
122, ALT 112, anion gap of 25, lactate of 7.3, creatinine of
3.3.  He was given 2 stress doses of steroid on [**6-9**].  He was
intubated at 220 AM on [**2144-6-10**] as pt was requiring 100% NRB to
keep sats >90.  Gas was 7.15/32/69 after intubation.  Pt
initially received vanc/zosyn, then changed to ceftriaxone, then
switched back to zosyn/doxy/flagyl to cover vibrio.  Prior to
arriving was started on levophed, vasopressin, given 1 amp
bicarb, kphos, cvp 6-8, not making any urine.  Bladder pressure
24.
.
ROS: unable to obtain


Past Medical History:
- HLD
- Bilateral hand surgery
- Vibrio sepsis in [**6-/2144**] requiring intubation, multiple
pressors with multiorgan failure (liver, kidney) necessitating

pupura fulminans on bilateral arms, and distal digit necrosis
from pressors.

Pertinent Results:
MICRO:
[**2144-6-17**] STOOL VIBRIO ISOLATE FROM [**Hospital1 **] LAB FOR ID/S.

TTE [**2144-6-10**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium
is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
interventricular septum appears mildly hypokinetic compared to
the inferolateral wall which is hyperdynamic. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2144-6-10**]: There is interval decrease in the bilateral
interstitial opacities suggestive of a decrease in the pulmonary
edema. Considering repositioning the tip of the central venous
line on the left side.

RENAL U/S [**2144-6-11**]:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Hypoechoic structure in the interpolar region of the right
kidney likely represents a cyst, but cannot be completely
characterized with ultrasound.  This could be further
characterized with a contrast-enhanced cross-sectional exam when
the renal function is improved (MRI would be preferred).

RUQ U/S [**2144-6-16**]:
IMPRESSION: No biliary dilatation identified on this very
limited bedside
ultrasound of the right upper quadrant. There is a right pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. SIRS, severe sepsis, septic shock (vibrio fluvialis
infection): Likely GI source of vibrio fluvialis (isolated from
OSH culture data) given presentation with bloody diarrhea.
Cultures from OSH were obtained and send to [**Hospital1 **] labs for
speciation, thought to possibly be parahaemolytics? ID
consulted, was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and
narrowed to Ceftazadime and Cipro for 2 wk course. All other
cultures were negative.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation:
Intubated and successfully able to be weaned. Due to aggressive
fluid repletion causing volume overload and abdominal
compartment syndrome (see below), patient went into respiratory
failure and had to be intubated. After exploratory laparotomy
with surgical decompression, oxygenation status improved. After
abdominal closure, patient was successfully weaned off
ventilator.

3. Acute renal failure / Acute tubular necrosis: Caused by ATN
in the setting of poor perfusion due to sepsis as above. He had
a temporary line placed, and was started on CRRT by Nephrology
service. Pt was initially grossly anasarcic. After pressors were
weaned, fluid was successfully pulled off with CRRT.  On
hospital day 11, urine output increased.  A tunneled HD line was
placed. He has continued to do well on tri-weekly HD for the
duration of his stay, with gradually improving UOP indicative of
resolution phase of ATN.

4. Thrombocytopenia, DIC: Likely secondary to DIC and low
thrombopoeitin. No schistocytes were seen on smear with Heme. Pt
was transfused 2 units of platelets during his MICU stay. His
platelets slowly recovered, with repeat smear showing no
hemolysis and recovering bone marrow.

5. Shock liver: Secondary to hypotension, sepsis, and
compartment syndrome. No history of liver disease. Hepatitis
serologies were sent and were negative. His AST/ALT started to
improved. He developed hypoglycemia, a marker for poor synthetic
function. However, several days later the alk phos and Tbili
rose, thought to be most likely [**1-8**] resolving shock liver.
However, pt also had rising leukocytosis. RUQ u/s showed no
gross abnormalities, though it was a limited study.  There was
concern for acalculous cholecystitis, but he clinically was
improving so no further interventions were performed.

6. Compartment syndrome: s/p decompression with surgery on [**6-10**].
He had several dressing changes with surgery. His bladder
pressures were monitored frequently. Once his edema improved, he
was closed with surgery on [**6-18**].

7. Hypoglycemia: Patient was hypoglycemic in ICU, likely
secondary to poor liver function. He was initially placed on
D10W to maintain euglycemia. Tube feeds were started and
hypoglycemia resolved. =

8. Fever: Pt was afebrile for the duration of the admission,
however on hospital day #8, following closure of his abdominal
incision, he spiked a temperature to 105.7 and became
tachycardic and hypotensive, and developed rapid hyperkalemia
and a CK of 900. The initial differential included malignant
hyperthermia, discontinuation of CRRT (had been transitioned to
HD) and sepsis induced by narrowing of antibiotics.  Pt was
given dantrolene, CRRT was restarted, hyperkalemia corrected,
and abx were broadened with rapid resolution of his fever. When
blood cultures returned negative, diagnosis became very likely
malignant hyperthermia. Patient will need to receive genetic
testing through PCP ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2174**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) in future to determine
whether he has heritable form of malignant hyperthermia
(autosomal dominant).

9. Delirium: After extubation on day #10, patient developed
paranoia and delusions determined to be most likely ICU
delirium. Per psych consult, patient was started on Haldol qHS
with resolution of symptoms; he returned to [**Location 213**] sensorium by
day #10.

10. Purpura fulminans: Patient developed purpura fulminans
secondary to DIC/sepsis, followed by tense, non-hemorrhagic
bullae thought to
