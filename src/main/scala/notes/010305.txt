TEE [**12-8**]:
Conclusions: Prebypass
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the
apex, apical and mid portions of the inferior and inferoseptal
walls Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was
notified in person of the results on [**2180-12-8**] at 915am.
Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
and milrinone. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. It appears well
seated and the leaflets move well. No aortic insufficiency seen.
The mean gradient across the aortic valve is 11 mm Hg. Mild
mitral regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2180-12-12**] 8:38 AM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man s/p cabg
Final Report :
Inspiratory effort is improved, although lung volumes are still
low. A right internal jugular line projects over the mid SVC.
Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis are not
significantly changed since [**2180-12-10**]. Decreased width of the
cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
may be due to PA technique and are grossly stable. There is no
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2180-12-10**] with stable
small
bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 9418**] was a same day admit to cardiac surgery for
aortic valve replaceemnt and coronary artery bypass grafting.
Please see the operative report for details, in summary he had:
-Aortic valve replacement with a 29-mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Ultra
bioprosthesis.
-Coronary bypass grafting x 1: Left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending coronary artery. His BYPASS TIME was
109 minutes with a CROSS-CLAMP TIME of 86 minutes. He tolerated
the operation well and was transferred from the operating room
to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition on Milrinone,
Phenylephrine and Propofol infusions.
He remained hemodynamically stable and within several hours woke
neurologically intact, was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated. Nephrology was consulted to help manage his renal
disease. He continued to improved was weaned from all vasoactive
infusions and was transferred to the stepdown floor on POD4.
Once on the floor the patient developed atrial fibrillation
which was initially treated with BBlockade, and when that was
not successful, Amiodarone was added. Additionally the patient
was started on coumadin. A single dose of levaquin was given for
sm. amt sternal drainage that resolved in 24 hrs.
Over the next several days the patient worked with nursing and
physical therapy to increase his activity and endurance levels.
On POD#11 he was discharged to home. First INR check day after
discharge with target INR 2.0-2.5 to be followed by ********
