Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Thoracentesis
2. VATS and decortication, left lung
3. Intubated on [**2125-2-5**].

History of Present Illness:
51 man with a PMH significant only for active tobacco use,
presented initially to [**Hospital6 302**] with 4 days of
pleuritic chest pain. Pain began suddenly last Tuesday ([**1-30**])
and was described as sharp left sided chest pain, worse with
breathing and movement.  It had been improving, but worsened on
the day of presentation.  At [**Hospital6 **], a CT was
negative for PE, but showed a 19 mm ill-defined pleural-based
mass adjacent to the descending aorta. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was evaluated by thoracic surgery with
initial concern for dissection. However, a repeat CTA here
showed the lesion to have an enhancing rim and internal fluid
density, consistent with abscess. Labs were significant for a
WBC of 13.1.  ROS was otherwise significant for several episodes
of soaking night sweats the week prior to presentation, and a
productive cough described as "mucous-like" x 1 day. Otherwise,
he denied fevers, SOB, hemoptysis, n/v. Appetite and energy have
been good.
.
Patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics
including vanc/levo/flagyl, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
On [**2-5**], the patient began experiencing tachypnea and worsening
pain w/ splinting.  Dilaudid PCA was increased, however the
remained tachypneic (RR 40s) with hiccoughs with each breath.
Repeat CXR showed sizable interval increase in left pleural
effusion, without
obvious etiology.  ABGs showed 7.34/55/66.  Nebs were given, but
patient appeared to be tiring and was intubated on the floor. He
was then transferred temporarily to the PACU, then to the MICU.
A thoracentesis was performed on [**2-5**] and 450 mL of partially
bloody, purulent fluid was drained.  On [**2-7**] thoracic surgery
performed debridement and decortication of left pleural empyema.

.
Patient is now being transferred from MICU to CC7.  He now feels
sharp left sided pleuritic pain with deep breaths and movement.
He also has shortness of breath and mild chills.  He had a
productive cough and he self suctions. He denies hemoptysis,
sweats, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, leg
pain.  His chest pain is well controlled with Dilaudid PCA.

Radiographic Studies:
-MRI T-spine ([**2125-2-3**]): Extremely limited exam due to patient
motion artifact. A pleural-based collection within the left
inferior lung, immediately adjacent to the aorta, has rim
enhancement with a T2 hyperintense core.  This could represent
an abscess or a neoplasm.  Aortitis should also be considered
given its proximity to the aorta.
.
-CTA Chest & Abdomen ([**2125-2-4**]):  1. No evidence of thoracic
aortic dissection.  2. Rounded rim-enhancing low density lesion
immediately adjacent to the descending thoracic aorta at T9/10.
The differential diagnosis of this structure is broad, but
includes abscess.
3. Very small left pleural effusion.  4. Patchy opacities within
the right upper lobe may represent an infectious pneumonia.
Patchy opacities at both lung bases may reflect atelectasis or
an infectious process.  5. Colonic diverticulosis, without
evidence of diverticulitis.
.
-CXR ([**2125-2-8**]):  1.  No definite pneumothorax with stable
appearance of bilateral basilar plate-like atelectasis and
layering left-sided effusion/postoperative edema.  2.  Air noted
in the region of left cardiophrenic sulcus likley represents
small locule of air with surrounding collapsed lung but
difficult to exclude a focal pneumomediastinum.  Attention is
suggested on followup radiographs.
.
-CXR #1 ([**2125-2-9**]): Cardiac size is normal.  There are low lung
volumes with bibasilar segmental atelectases which are
unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left pleural effusion is
small.  Two left chest tubes are in place.
.
-CXR #2 ([**2125-2-9**]): In the interval, one of the left chest tubes
has been removed.  If any, there is a tiny left apical
pneumothorax with no clinical significance.  Left chest basal
tube remains in place.  Bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.
Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  A small left pleural
effusion and/or pleural thickening is unchanged.
.
CXR ([**2125-2-11**]): Small residual pneumothorax, best visualized on
the lateral view. Bibasilar atelectasis and/or scarring.  Small
amount of pleural thickening.
.
-ECHO ([**2125-2-9**]):  The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Biatrial dilation.
