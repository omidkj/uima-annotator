Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
1. AMS: On admission, pt presented with lower extremity weakness
and increased falling which according to the wife was
chronologically related to his sinusitis diagnosed and treated
with bactrim on [**10-14**]. In ED,pt with witnessed activity c/w
seizure and pt was loaded with dilantin and given 2mg Ativan.
Lumbar puncture was performed, fourth tube of CSF with 1 wbc/
500 rbc (increased over tube #1) so patient was started on
empiric acyclovir for herpes simplex encephalopathy awaiting
further culture results.  EEG on admission consistent with
encephalopathy, no evidence of active seizure.  Pt not known to
be immunocompromised. Also on admission, concerning for possible
ingestion and toxic encephalopathy with recent suicide attempt
two weeks prior.  Also, with hx of sinusitis inappropriately
treated and seizure on presentation, concerning for cavernous
sinus thrombosis, so patient started on vanco for MRSA sinusitis
and MRI/MRA headindicated when stable off of pressors (ENT
consult obtained, agree with plan). CT of sinuses shows changes
c/w prior surgery, no bony penetration, 'underwhelming' for
source of infxn as per ENT.  HSV PCR/final negative, and
Acyclovir D/C'd.  MRI/MRA of brain did not show evidence of
cavernous sinus thrombosis or any acute abnormality. The patient
was intubated, during which time assessment of his mental status
was hindered secondary to sedation.  Post extubation, he
remained alert and awake, however with a clouded sensorium,
lethargic, and increased agitation - delerium waxed and waned.
Neuro and Psych following, with ddx's including toxic-metabolic
[**2-29**] uremia, infectious, or ischemic processes.  Cx's were all
negative, and pt was unable to get a repeat head MR [**2-29**]
inability to lie flat. He continued to be therapeutic on
Dilantin/Phenytoin. Once transferred to floor, continued
phenytoin, TID holding for supratherapeutic doses and checking
levels daily with goal 15-20 after Phenytoin levels corrected
for low albumin.
Once transferred to floor, pt's mental status improved everyday.
Began to orient better to both time and place. Eventually grew
quite agitated, requiring medication for his anxiety, pt known
in past to have anxiety disorder. Haldol used at doses of 2.5 to
acutely calm pt down, but not effective as desired. Pt tolerated
trazodone, but this too did not effect tranquility. Psych
consult recommended seroquel/quetiapine 25mg am, 50mg evening
dose to help pt sleep, and 25mg qhs:prn if continued difficulty
sleeping. Quetiapine can be titrated up by 25 mg each day up to
a maximum of 200mg total in one day should patient continue to
have difficulty sleeping and/or day time agitation.
2.  RESP - likely [**2-29**] edema of sepsis.  Required ventilatory
support. 1st extubation attempt failed [**2-29**] inc WOB and/or
aspiration, reintubated [**11-2**] for increase wob/fatigue. Weaned to
PS, and re-extubated on [**11-8**] - with persistent AG acidosis (pH
7.26-7.30) from renal failure. Started on 14 day course of
Levoflox/Flagyl for presumed asp. PNA. Developed increased WOB
and fatigue on [**11-11**], placed back on Bipap with good response.
Received standing HCO3 replacement to correct acidemia.
Decision to undergo dialysis made on [**11-11**], in hopes that
resolving uremia and acidosis will help alleviate resp
depression.  Pt underwent multiple failed S/S evaluations for
aspiration.  Cleared for thin PO's on [**11-10**]. Had PPFT placed for
TF's.  Was weaned to 35% FM on [**11-13**] and tolerated it well, but
then developed hypotension, CO2 retention, and hypoxia on [**11-15**].
Was placed back on Bipap with improvement of oxygenation and
ventilation.  Respiratory status remained tenuous, with low
threshold for intubation.   Possibilites for resp failure and
difficulty weaning to FM at this time included volume overload
and PNA.Started on Vancomycin again on [**11-15**] for sputum growing
MRSA. After transfer to floor, CXR showed LLL infiltrate vs
atelectasis, ?effusion. Pt continued to improve respiratory
status, weaning O2 supplement by face mask from 40% to _____2L
NC?. Pt desaturated after 10 minutes to an oxygen level of 90%
on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] O2 was continued. Lungs sounding clearer each day with
decreased sputum and coughing, cough reflex intact. Needs chest
physical therapy and incentive spiromety to prevent mucus
plugging.

2. Shock: Pt hypotensive requiring Levophed pressor on
admission.  Pt in most lkley septic shock, with low grade temps
escalating to temps of 103 and witnessed seizure.  Pt with
sinusitis dx'd by ENT on [**10-14**], history of papilloma removed from
the sinuses, and cultures from the 17th positive for MRSA
although pt only treated with Bactrim.  [**10-22**] Blood cultures
positive for GPC in clusters. While sinusitis is rare cause of
sepsis, it is most likely source of bacteremia c/w mrsa--
Vancomycin dosed appropriately for renal failure (cking
troughs). Also restarted Ceftriaxone on [**10-24**].  CT of/sinus not
showing obvious source for seeding; pt currently off levophed,
with good pressure.  On [**11-2**], after 1st extubation, pt with
septic picture (hypotension, hypoxia, intubated), treated on
MUST, cultures sent. Pt failed [**Last Name (un) 104**]-stim, on steroids with
improvement of bp, now off pressors.  Received 7 day course of
stress dose steroids, then switched to quick Prednisone taper.
Became hypotensive after Prednisone tapered off, and failed
another [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.  Was started on standing Dexamethasone 1mg
[**Hospital1 **] for presumed adrenal insufficiency.  Other than MRSA in
sputum, no infectious etiology found. Once transferred to floor,
began
