History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86647**] is a very pleasant 78 year old man with a PMH
significant for dyslipidemia, hypertension, CKD, COPD, afib,
bladder ca s/po cystectomy/prostectomy with urostomy,
parathyroid resection, and lung nodule resection who presented
to [**Hospital3 26615**] with a day's worth of weaknes. There, he was
found to be hypotense to the 80s sytolic (normally 110s at home
on 2 BP meds), WBC 34,000, a creatinine doubled to 4, and a
lactate of 4.9, with an INR of 4.8. He had a recent U/A at a
PCP's office a week ago which apparently showed a Klebsiella
UTI, for which he was treated with a week's worth of ABX (he is
not sure which kind). [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] gave him Levoquin and
Vancomyin. He was also noted at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to have a tropinin
of 0.21.
.
In our ED, he got a CVL for SBPs int he 80s, and got 2 L NS. He
also recieved a dose of Zosyn. Our ED labs were notable for WBC
count of 30.4, with a bandemia of 5%, and a HCT of 37.1, with
plts of 11. Lactate in the ED was 3.1. Levophed was placed at
bedside but not hung.
.
He says that his story started two mondays ago, when he had some
profuse vomiting leading to some back [**Doctor Last Name **], for which his PCP
prescribed him oxycodone. The next Wed (1.5 weeks ago) he
noticed some dark urine; his PCP thus prescribed him an
antibiotic to be taken for a week, which he took diligently. He

A CXR showed a R IJ in place, but no overt pulmonary edema.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was very pleasant, AAOx3.
.

IMAGING:
.
CXR [**2137-2-21**]:
FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a right-sided
internal jugular venous catheter. The tip is slightly obscured
by overlapping lead from pacemaker; however, appears to
terminate in the low SVC. A single-lead left-sided pacemaker is
unchanged.Within the lungs, no focal opacity to suggest
pneumonia is seen. No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
pneumothorax is present. There is mild vascular congestion. The
heart size is top normal, unchanged. Chain suture is noted in
the left hemithorax with volume loss suggestive of prior
resection. IMPRESSION: Central catheter in standard position
without pneumothorax.
.
Abdominal U/S [**2137-2-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount of gallbladder sludge. No specific son[**Name (NI) 493**]
sign to
suggest acute cholecystitis. Top normal common bile duct
diameter.
2. Bilateral renal cysts and mild cortical thinning.
