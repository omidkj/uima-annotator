Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and hiatel hernia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-1-26**] Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication


History of Present Illness:
74 year old woman with interstitial lung disease and severe
respiratory impairment. She underwent a bronchoscopy and review
of her thoracic imaging by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Based on the CT images,
there was evidence of ongoing inflammation and therefore she was
treated empirically for
non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) as there was no
readily identifiable inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. It was thought that the trigger for the NSIP is the
aspiration and as such, she was evaluated for repair of her
sizable hiatal hernia. She recently completed a Prednisone taper
course prior to the surgery and presented this time for an
elective laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair repair and nissen
fundoplication.

Past Medical History:
-  COPD
-  CHF
-  Pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed CT [**2126**]
-  Osteoporosis with compression fractures
-  Hypercholesterolemia
-  Hypertension
-  GERD
-  Anxiety/Depression
-  Insomnia
-  Post-surgical hypothyroidism
-  Melanoma removed from back, left axillary lymph node
dissection [**2107**].
-  Right knee and hip replacement.


Social History:
Widowed.  Has one child.  Worked as a quality inspector for
[**Company 2892**],
retired [**2116**].  Denies ETOH.  Quit smoking in [**2119**] and was a
45ppy
smoker.  Does not have any pets.  No birds in house.  No recent
travels.  No molds in house.  Currently lives in [**Hospital3 **]
facility.


Family History:
Mother deceased from complications related to RA.  Father
deceased age 52 from MI.  Brother has CAD.  Sister deceased from
traumatic fall.


Physical Exam:
VS: Temp 98.4, HR 92SR, BP 119/49, RR 18, pulse oximetry 94% on
3LNC
Physical Exam:
Gen: pleasant in NAD
Resp: slight rales t/o
CV: RRR S1, S2, no MRG or JVD
Abd: soft, NT, ND
Ext: no pressure sores, trace BLE edema


Pertinent Results:
[**2131-1-27**] Barium swallow study:

IMPRESSION: No evidence of leak. Contrast passes through the
duodenum and
into the small bowel.

[**2131-2-2**] US BLE duplex: neg DVT

[**2131-1-30**] CTA C/A/P:
IMPRESSION:
1. Known pulmonary fibrosis, roughly stable in appearance since
recent
examination from [**2130-11-24**]. New interval development of
bilateral, left
greater than right, superimposed parenchymal consolidation
concerning for
pneumonia.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental levels,
though
evaluation of the lower lobes is limited by respiratory motion.
3. Dynamic abnormal concave bowing of trachea that is suggestive
of
tracheomalacia and dedicated imaging examination can be
performed as
indicated.
4. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, with some enlarged since a
recent exam from [**2130-11-24**], likely reactive in nature, though
given history of known melanoma, metastasis cannot be entirely
excluded, and attention could be paid on followup imaging as
indicated.
5. No abnormal fluid collections within the abdomen that would
be concerning for abscess formation.
6. Incompletely characterized 1.6 cm liver lesion in segment
III, recommend correlation with prior imaging or if not
available, ultrasound can be considered for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84254**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2131-1-26**]
for her paraesophageal hernia with laparoscopic Nissen. She
recovered in usual fashion. A barium swallow study was done on
[**2131-1-27**] which did not show any leak. She had some coughing on
[**2131-1-27**], at which time she was resumed on home meds, and given
aggressive pulmonary toilet. Pulmonology evaluated her and did
not feel she warranted bronchoscopy at that time. The patient
remained on her home oxygen. She was evaluated by PT/OT on
[**2131-1-29**] who determined she would best benefit from pulmonary
rehab. Her cough worsened and chest xray revealed CHF. She was
diuresed well, however on [**2131-1-30**] developed 102 fever, was
pancultured and started on vancomycin and zosyn. She required
transfer to the ICU for sepsis on [**2131-1-31**]. She required low dose
neosynephrine. She was found to have MRSA pneumonia which
resolved on IV vancomycin. Her last vancomycin trough level was
18 on [**2131-2-2**]. ID consulted and recommended PICC line with IV
vancomycin to continue until [**2131-2-14**] with CBC, Chem panel and
vanco trough [**2131-2-6**]. The patient was transfered to the floor on
[**2131-2-4**]. She has been medically stable without fevers or
hypotension on the floor and is stable for pulmonary rehab. It
is noted we do not have a recent echo documenting LV function,
and the patient did not come in with beta blockers or ace
inhibitors. She should have close outpatient follow up with her
primary care physician regarding initiation of these meds if
tolerated.
