This is a 72-year-old female with a history of type 2
diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and asplenia
who was admitted on [**2173-6-8**] with fever, cough, and dyspnea,
found to be septic from Streptococcus bovis bacteremia.  She
was admitted to the MICU, started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics, resuscitated with IV fluids, briefly required
pressors.  She was maintained in the unit for approximately 2
weeks with minimal change in her clinical status.  She was
unable to be weaned from the vent.  She developed ATN and had
slow recovery of her creatinine, but no resolution of her
BUN, concerning for ongoing renal dysfunction.  She developed
pancreatitis and abnormal LFTs.  There were attempts to
determine the etiology of the Streptococcus bovis, concern
being an abdominal process or GI malignancy; however, she was
unable to undergo CAT scan given marked edematous during her
hospital stay.  She was followed by the Infectious Disease
Team and the Nephrology Team as well as Gastroenterology Team
and ERCP.  She developed an obstructive cholestatic picture,
however, was unable to undergo ERCP secondary to the risk
given her comorbidities and poor prognosis.  A family meeting
was held on [**2173-6-23**] to discuss her grave prognosis.  Family
decided this was not within her wishes as the patient was
initially DNR/DNI and had previously stated that she did not
want to be trached or on long-term ventilatory support.
Therefore, care was withdrawn on [**2173-6-21**].  She was placed on
the morphine drip and extubated.  She died at 7:45 p.m. on
[**2173-6-23**].  The family was notified and an autopsy was
declined.
